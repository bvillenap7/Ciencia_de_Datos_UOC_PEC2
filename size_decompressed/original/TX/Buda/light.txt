It was going kind of fast. It was lit, white light, it wasn’t one big light it had maybe like three lights on it in a horizontal line, but the lights were close as if almost touching. I tried to catch it on video but it wouldn’t reach that far since it was dark. I tried to get another witness but it was too late the UFO had already gone past the trees where we couldn’t see it. There was only on flying object. The flying object was flying in almost a straight line across the sky. For sure it wasn’t a plane because I know what they look like I see them often at night in my backyard. It wasn’t a helicopter or jet either. It really is an unidentified flying object.
