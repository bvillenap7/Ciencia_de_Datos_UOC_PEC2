Bright Light over I20 near Tyler TX;2020-02-14 19:30:00;2.5 hours;Bright Light over I20 near Tyler TX I left work around 19:30 and drove to the highway (I20) I was heading west.  As soon as I got on the highway I noticed 2 very bright lights in the sky.  1 directly in front of me and the other slightly north of the of the other. As I traveled down the road, I thought about how bright they were, then the second light started turning more north, this is when I noticed the green light, obviously an airplane, the reason I am reporting this is because the first light never moved, just remained directly in front as I continued down the highway.  This started at exit 599 and stayed directly in front until I exited the highway onto US-271, I the traveled north to CR757 then home. Arriving around 20:20. Now,from the house the light was directly west, I opened my SkyGuide app to see what plant or Star it may be yet nothing lined up.  My wife met me outside and I showed her where the light was and she, of course, looked at me like I was being silly. We went in the house,! talked for a few minutes, at 21:00, I came back out to gaze some more and the light was now gone.;32.4646;-95.1263
