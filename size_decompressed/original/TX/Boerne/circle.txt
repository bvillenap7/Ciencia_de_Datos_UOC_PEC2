A few days prior to this i saw a similar object only white do the same exact thing but i didnt think much of it.  When i got home a friend contacted me and said he had seen a object in the sky and described it exactly as i saw it before i even told him i had seen it, he was about 5 miles away from where i saw it.

4 White lights above the clouds going in a circle.  Disappeared in an instant one by one.;2013-11-03 06:35:00;10 minutes;4 White lights above the clouds going in a circle.  Disappeared in an instant one by one. I saw 4 lights that would disappear with clouds, they were circling around slowly.  In a very large diameter, they seemed stationary, I ran 500 ft. they seemed to follow me.   Each light was white and not very bright.  Each light  was about the size of a full moon.   The other witnesses stayed in place,   I felt as though the lights followed me, but they said they did not move. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded quite sincere to us.  She insisted that the lights could not be advertising lights, given that they distinctly disappeared behind clouds.  PD));29.8486162790698;-98.6806488372098
