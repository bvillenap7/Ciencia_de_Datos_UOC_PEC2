Oval light sphere ufo over DFW Texas with video;2019-01-27 17:45:00;5 minutes;Oval light sphere ufo over DFW Texas with video I recently began experimenting with my new camera.  A powerful Nikon P900 camera which has an incredible 83X zoom.  I just got it back from having it converted to full spectrum.  So it will record in infrared and UV.  I installed a 665nm IR pass filter with a MC/UV filter.   I was in my backyard in the Mid-Cities, Texas, area and had pointed towards a plane flying overhead.  It was on autofocus and my tripod was in the house.  Once I lost sight of the plane behind the trees I scanned through the vapor trail which curiously looked like a chem trail.  I was fumbling with the camera hoping to get it to focus when I caught a flash of light.  I then zoomed in on the light and it came into focus a few times.  I videoed for approx 5 minutes.  I kept losing the object without the tripod so I made the decision to enter the house to retrieve it and come back out to film.  In my excitement I never restarted recording!!!!!!!  And dang it, I had it zoomed in and in frame and steady!  But I never hit record.   The video I do have is fairly compelling.  You can tell it’s not anything like a standard flying craft we’re familiar with.  It had a field around it and sometimes looked like a hamburger on it’s edge!  Like a patty in the middle of two pieces of bread.  Very strange.  The time was approximately 5:45 PM Jan 27th, 2019.  If you review the footage you can skip ahead to five minutes where I slowed the footage down.  Peter, it pulsates.  It’s very obvious.  I just had to share it with you.  I’m a regular listener to Coast to Coast and love what you add. I bought this camera for this purpose and if I captured this so randomly I imagine I will have more and better footage to produce in the future.  Oh, I was filming towards the southeast from the North Richland Hills area about an hour from sunset.  Best regards...;32.807;-97.274
