Lights over Haltom City.;2015-07-09 22:00:00;2 minutes;Lights over Haltom City. Went to the back yard to let the dogs out.  My wife and I looked to the southwestern sky and we saw what looked like at first a bright star, but it began to move very fast.   It moved heading north.  Then it got brighter for like 6 seconds.  Then dimmed down a bit then turned bright orange.  And disappeared like nothing happen.   Then a minute later two more lights came out of the northern sky.  They turn bright orange and disappeared.  Very strange.  Definitely not a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD));32.807;-97.274
