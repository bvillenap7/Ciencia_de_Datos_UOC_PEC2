The sound was huge and overtook the sky so fast I doubt many people heard it.  The noise came and went and then abrupt silence. The roar sounded like a giant craft.   I called the FAA but they didn't know anything.  Interesting though, the live DFW tower radar showed no aircraft in this area during that time.;32.807;-97.274
