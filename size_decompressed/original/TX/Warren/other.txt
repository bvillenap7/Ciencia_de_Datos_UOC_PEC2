We have owned property for a long while, and last Sept 2013 me and my child were awakened by a green color light through the window coming from the sky being shined on us.  We both tried to pretend it didn't happen and hadn't seen much until Jan 2014. In January 2014, I asked my neighbor if she had seen anything unusual in the sky, and without missing a beat she said, You see them to?  I was relieved that I wasn't going crazy.  At first it was 1 or 2 every now and then.  Since the first of March no it happens a lot and I'm not sure if they are all together or its just huge.  I can shine a q-beam outside and its almost as if they swarm the sky. They change colors red, blue , orange, green, white so far. They move super fast with no noise what so ever. Its as if they illuminate the woods because some nights its as bright as dawn. I have taken pictures but if I let camera flash it will disappear. One night I counted 8 of them on all sides of the property. Its very desolate here and I have called nasa with noone contacting me back. I am writing this report because this morning the dogs were barking uncontrolibly and I shined a light around the woods and after I shut the light off for about 5 minutes something shined a light back and flashed it 5-6 times. Ever since Sept 2013 the electrical on my truck is haywire and every appliance in my home we are building has quit at some point.  I am not a beleiver of aliens but something is happening here and noone can answer it.  My animals bark at it and my deer camera even took pictures of one that was so low it was above the trees.;30.6002;-94.4127
