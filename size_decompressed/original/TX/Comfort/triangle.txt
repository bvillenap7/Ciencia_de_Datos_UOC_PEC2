angular shaped object;2005-04-29 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;angular shaped object It was a fairly clear evening, a few hazy clouds high.  We were gazing at the southern sky, when this boomarang shaped object appeared, moving east to west.  It did not appear to be illuminated in any way, but more reflective, like a night time cloud.   I could not tell it's size because I could not determine it's altitude.  But it was very visible in the nightime sky.  It was not traveling at very high rate of speed.  There was absolutely no sound from the object.  The object kept a steady flight path, but not a smooth one rather jerky.  I have been an avid night sky watcher most of my life, enjoying shooting stars and seeing satelites pass over.  This sighting Friday night has really knocked me for a loop, because until now, I really didn't believe in UFOs ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed the Titan IV booster, launched from Cape Canaveral at 20:55 hrs. (EDT) on this date.  It might have been visible on its second orbit around the earth, at which time it might have been venting rocket fuel.  However, we have never heard of a case in which the rocket vented fuel on its second orbit.  PD));29.9638;-98.9062

Looked in the sky 2 min later and the bright light was closer looked like a really bright star but was low.  It came closer and made no noise and came really low to the ground.  Passed over head me and my friends real slow.  It had blue lights and the bright light all in shape of triangle.  I have video for any proof;29.9638;-98.9062
