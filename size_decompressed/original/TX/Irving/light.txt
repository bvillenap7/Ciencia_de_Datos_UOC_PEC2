Light source, 90 degree sharp turn, amazing acceleration above Texas skies.;2005-04-15 20:00:00;2-3 seconds;Light source, 90 degree sharp turn, amazing acceleration above Texas skies Travelling westbound on hwy 635, I and my fiance saw a green light above the horizon.  The light source appeared to be pretty far off, but understandably hard to tell when looking in space. Suddenly, the light source did a 90 degree turn and accelerated and an unbelievable speed. I asked my fiance if she saw it, she replied, Yes, what was that?  I said, I have no idea, but nothing manmade can turn and accelerate like that.   I have tried to see if others had seen it as Irving is in DFW metroplex (not podunk, Arkansas) to no avail. FWIW - I am an engineer, and my fiance is a ((physician specialty deleted))  I feel this is noteworthy as we are not some wackjobs mistaken Venus for a UFO while traveling down a curvy road ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Many described the object as being a shooting star with a green tail. As it rose into the sky they say that it stopped, flashed red, and disappeared. I did not see it, however.

UFO, with helicopters.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from former airline employee.  PD));2017-02-17 20:40:00;20 minutes;UFO, with helicopters. I observed a brilliant light west of my location. It was not Venus. It was not an airplane, or in usual flight path towards DFW.  (I have worked at an airline at DFW for 24 years, I know the flight patterns and what an aircraft looks like.)  This light was hovering, and so bight it radiated starburst.  There were a dozen or so helicopters circling it.  I shot video, you can clearly see helicopters going around the object, even passing over head.  They are different than object, in they have the typical lighting after about 15 minutes, the light descended closer to ground, and then proceeds west, diminishing in intensity of brightness.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wC3e-QflaI;32.8740007738308;-96.9663674639487
White glowing lights overhead in Irving. TX.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus.  Anonymous report.  PD));2017-11-03 06:45:00;Morning;White glowing lights overhead in Irving, Texas It was a typical Friday morning.  I was up by 5 am and in my car by 6 for my 35 min commute to Dallas.  The drive was uneventful, til about 15 minutes on highway 183 until the traffic came to a grinding halt, that lasted about 20 minutes.   As I sat on the highway, I figured there must be an accident ahead, and then I saw this magnificent light in the sky.  I knew it was not a star, a planet nor tthe moon and I immediately ruled them out.   Tired of sitting on the highway, I got off on the next ramp only to find myself stuck waiting to catch a traffic light.  I was compelled to look at the light because there was something off about it.  It wasn't a helicopter.  It was so quiet outside it really surprised me.   Took a couple of pics then decided to turn on my video.  I witnessed this light shining brighter still, glowing and it appeared to be two circles of light.  It became very bright then dimmed and began hovering away at a very fast rate of speed.  I am convinced it was a UfO.

pulsating orange / white light hovering;2019-10-12 17:10:00;30 seconds;pulsating orange / white light hovering Report 1 of 2  On Saturday, October 12, 2019, my girlfriend and I were working in the yard at her house.  At 5:10 PM, with bright blue skies, I observed to small orange/white light that looked like a bright star overhead at about 80-degrees NNE of my location in Irving Texas.  I could not make out any shape.  It was slowly pulsating and was not moving.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend, and she saw it too.  After about 20 â€“ 30 seconds, I went to my car, a few feet away, to get my binoculars. After retrieving my binoculars, my girlfriend told me that it faded away, and we could no longer see it.;32.8740007738308;-96.9663674639487
3 red/orange objects rapidly move across the sky near Dallas on Thanksgiving eve;2020-11-26 20:00:00;7-8 minutes;3 red/orange objects rapidly move across the sky near Dallas on Thanksgiving eve At approximately 8 PM CST we were stargazing in our back yard. While I was lining up my telescope with the moon and mars, we observed an object come across the sky. It was moving so fast I could not get it lined up in the telescope. It moved from the southwest sky flying towards the northeast. In total, there were 3 objects, spaced approximately 2-3 minutes apart following the exact same pattern. The objects glowed red or orange as they approached and from behind. There was no noise.  The object was at least 5,000 feet up and rapidly moved across the sky. We are near an airport and there was a SW flight in the landing pattern (they may have seen it) and it was significantly higher than that and the objects we saw were going much faster. As the 3rd object passed us, I ran to the front of the house and saw it flicker and disappear a moment later.;32.8740007738308;-96.9663674639487
