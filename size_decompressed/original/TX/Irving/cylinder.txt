At first I thought it was perhaps the space station, as this is sometimes observed just after dark on a clear night.  However, this object had an irregular flight path and came to a complete stop and hovered.  When first sighted, the object appeared triangular with faint yellow-orange lights.  After hovering for a moment, the object suddenly and sharply began to move my direction in a descent and for a brief moment I could observe a large dark cylindrical object dotted with faint yellow-orange lights.  The object appeared to ascend, at which point it became faint again.  The object then moved in a SW direction and was barely visible after another 30 seconds.  The entire event lasted about 3 to 4 minutes and the object traveled about 15 miles in the final 30 seconds, not including elevation changes.  The object made no detectable soun! d.;32.8740007738308;-96.9663674639487
