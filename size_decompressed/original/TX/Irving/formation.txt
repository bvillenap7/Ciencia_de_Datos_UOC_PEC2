There were four lights apparently high in the sky moving from east to west.  One of the lights maneuvered erratically as they moved across the sky at a high rate of speed.  The formatin steadied and the lights disappeared to the north west. Because we are adjacent to DFW airport we are accustomed to seeing aircraft at night.  These lights were not like any of the aircraft lights observed in the past.  My wife was the first to notice and called me outside to observe.;32.8740007738308;-96.9663674639487
