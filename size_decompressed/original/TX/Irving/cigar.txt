Large Cigar Shaped Craft;2003-09-11 02:45:00;10-15 minutes;I was driving home from work traveling southbound on Loop 12 when I first saw a very large cigar shaped craft hovering directly over the road.  It had a very bright, round white light on top and a bright round red light at the bottom.  I did not notice any noise associated with it that you would expect from such a low flying aircraft.  I slowed to about 25-30 MPH as did the other vehicles on the road.  The craft at first was almost directly above me and seemed to be at about the height that traffic helicopters fly except that this object was at least as large as a commercial jet.  As I watched, the craft moved along slowly above the road, staying just in front of me.  It then slowly rotated clockwise until the red light was on the top & white light on the bottom.  It then rotated back to it's original position and moved to the east side of the road where it rotated again but to a horizontal position.  It continued to move around some and then crossed back over the road to the west side.  Once there, I saw an arm or wing come out from the side of the craft so that now it is kind of L shaped.  The wing had pulsating red lights in a circle on the end and then a solid, concentrated beam of white light was emitted from the tip of the wing down to the ground.  It appeared similar to a search light, but was more concentrated.  The beam moved around along the ground.  I watched the craft my entire drive south on Loop 12, then onto Spur 408 until I exited onto I-20 and could no longer see it.  During the entire sighting, traffic around me was also moving very slowly, and some vehicles had pulled over to the shoulder.  It was a clear night and the craft was so large, so close and with such bright lights, that it would have been impossible not to see it or to mistake it for a plane or helicopter.  I have never seen anything remotely like this and to be honest, I hope I never do again!;32.8740007738308;-96.9663674639487

Feb. 4 2021 Irving, Tx. 2 600 ft cigar shaped grey / transparent flying in formation 1000mph+ 10 planes near object by DFW airport;2021-02-04 18:20:00;30 seconds;Feb. 4 2021 Irving, Tx. 2 600 ft cigar shaped grey / transparent flying in formation 1000mph+ 10 planes near object by DFW airport Traveling north at altitude of 3000ft roughly 1000mph. Was watching the planes come in as i live southeast of dfw airport while smoking a cigarette. There was 8 to 10 planes in my line of sight getting ready to land and i saw 2 cigar shaped grey/ transparent flying close together in offset formation maybe 50 to 100ft apart at same altitude but maybe 5x speed and 6x to 7x bigger together so maybe each object was 3x bigger than 1 plane. They were very near to planes maybe less than a 1/2 mile in the air. Passengers had to have seen them. Was traveling north for about 15 seconds and instantly banked nnw directly headed toward airport for roughly 15 seconds until out of sight. It was scary and cool as they were cloaked but still visible. I wanted to call 911 for safety of passengers but dont want to be made fun of. Thats why i googled how to report sightings and found this sight. I want to say im 100% sure what it was it wasnt birds or planes or even trash. This! is not a hoax and no explanation can be given to this except for ufo. I think this here is all the information i can give also im not familiar with this site i hope someone sees this message and im not wasting my time. Thank you.;32.8740007738308;-96.9663674639487
