Oval shaped aircraft shimmered in the sky and disappears;2009-07-01 14:00:00;10 Seconds;Oval shaped aircraft shimmered in the sky and disappears I was driving down the street in the passenger seat of my car when me and my brother saw what looked to be a airplane light up and sparkle for a few seconds.  The light slowly faded away until we were able to discern that it was not a airplane, and was an oval shaped aircraft of somesort that I have never seen before.  The light continued to fade,and the craft began to look blurry, until the entire plane faded away and disappeared completely.  I was left looking all over the sky for the object, but it was gone.  It had just vanished in the middle of the sky, and it hadn't been flying at a very high altitude.;32.8740007738308;-96.9663674639487
