The aircraft  two commerical jets either 737's or 747's with no visible markings just a plain white body. The other aircraft wasn't quite white it was a greyish metallic color with a weird shape which i couldn't make out. The only way to describe the third aircraft was whale like, big up front like a whale with it's mouth wide open and the rest of the craft was normal in comparison with other big commerical aircraft. I was using binoculars 10 x 50 to observe the aircraft. The sky was clear except for the chemtrails the three planes where leaving. I put the craft around 20,000 feet moving west to east at a very slow speed for craft at that altitude. What really caught my eye was this strange orb looking object sitting stationary on the same path as the craft flew by. The orb which was reflecting sunlight was emitting a light. It was as if you where looking straight into a very powerful flashlight. And even though the sun was still out and hitting the object the light was very bright. After I observed the orb for a few minutes it just vanished. I waited until it got darker to see if maybe i was looking at a star but ther was no star bright enough in that part of the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  The third aircraft the witness describes is not inconsistent with an EC-135, which has a bulbous forward section to its fuselage.  We do not know what the bright object was.  Given that the sighting occurred approximately 45 minutes before the unannounced launch of an ICBM, probably from a U. S. submarine, we wonder whether the presence of an EC-135 eastbound over Texas may have had something to do with that launch.  PD));32.8740007738308;-96.9663674639487
