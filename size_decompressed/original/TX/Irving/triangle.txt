I was travelling south on hwy.360 just before post and paddock exit when a large triangular shaped aircraft flew right over me. My sunroof was open and I had the radio up, so I didn't hear it, I glanced up and seen the bottom of it about 10 foot higher than the budget suites motel. The U.F.O. then became stationary (hovering) above Ave.k. exit. I watched and my friend as a witness (she was in the truck with me)all the way, going south to Lamar exit, we went almost directly under it. The U.F.O. seemed to have a circular suction cup underneath it with three bright rectaingular lights on bottom that went off and on randomly. As we passed and it was behind us it all the sudden dissapeared. I don't know wich way it headed or where it may have gone. I myself have seen this U.F.O. twice since that night.;32.8740007738308;-96.9663674639487
