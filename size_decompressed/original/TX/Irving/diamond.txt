UFO Alien Encounters;2008-05-06 04:00:00;Unknown;UFO Alien Encounters  Two incidents on UFO alien encounters:  The first incident was several years ago the second one was recently on May 6, 2008.  I don’t know if the whole thing was a dream or if it was real but I can assure you that they communicated to me mentally and not verbally, as we do.  My first encounter with the aliens took placed several years ago.  They took me to their galaxy that had 5 suns and several planets, which I was able to see from their spaceship.  Since our galaxy only has one sun, I was astonished to see so many suns in just one galaxy.  I don’t recall ever getting out of the spaceship the whole trip was just like a “tour” through the universe.  They were green aliens, very short, not with the usual configuration depicted in Roswell, NM.  Their heads were wide, mostly by the cheeks area and they were very nice to me.  My most recent encounter was with just one alien.  This one had pink skin and came-up in a small gray color spaceship.  His head had a light bulb shape and he was skinny.  He told me via mind communication that it was time for me to go with them for good.  Some sort of force started taking me towards his spaceship (I started floating in the air) but then, suddenly, I decided I did not want to go yet, and saw myself back into my home.  The next day, May 7, 2008, I received a call from one of my doctor’s office, in which I was told they found pre-cancerous cells in a yearly routine exam I recently had.  Every year this exam comes-out normal and, all the sudden, right after the encounter I had with the alien, it happened to come-up abnormal.  Now I am going to have to get a biopsy done on June 2nd to check on the stage level of the cancer findings.;32.8740007738308;-96.9663674639487
