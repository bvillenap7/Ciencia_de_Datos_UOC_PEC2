Moved suddenly in reverse direction. There were 2 crafts visible while the 4th July Fireworks were going on.  One was very close to us red and green blinking lights, other was far away and looked like a green bright small light.   The one close to us was just static for about 10 minutes and then started moving in the direction of the blinking green lights, and disappeared over the buildings.  It then came back again with green light blinking ahead and red light blinking at the rear of the craft.   It looked like it dropped in height and moved side ways and then it was static.   Suddenly, the red and green lights switched places and craft started moving in the reverse direction.  I cannot think of any craft that can move in one direction, stop and simply reverse its direction without  turning.   Also the other craft, the green bright light was static for most of this time, at the end of the fireworks, it moved very rapidly from the static position and disappeared.   I am sure it was a U. S. Air Force surveillance craft, but I do not know of an aircraft or helicopter that can do that and not make any noise at all.;32.8740007738308;-96.9663674639487
