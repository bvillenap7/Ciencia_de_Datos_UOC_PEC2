We were looking at planets with the telescope. When we looked around to find the next planet/star/observation we saw the triangle pass over.

This is an UFO to me, I am just curious if it is to others as well.;2000-06-15 21:00:00;few minutes;This is an UFO to me, I am just curious if it is to others as well. Returning to the Oklahoma Panhandle State University campus after visiting a friend in an Amarillo, Texas hospital after a pit stop at a gas station in Stratford I saw in a distance an object made up of three visible lights. In the shape of a triangle.  It moved fast and smooth in flight.  It was less than a mile up in the air.  I was mesmerized, but I tell you that this object was an UFO to me.  It moved slow enough that I feel that government/airport tracking officials could ID it.  But it was low enough in the air that I wouldn't think that radar could confirm it's existence.  I went out to a creek crossing about 7 or so miles north of Goodwell, Oklahoma two times within a month timeframe and in a distance I feel that I saw the same formation gliding along the same path.  Of course, the sighting was not so closeup.;36.3311;-101.985
Triangle shaped craft traveling silently across the sky.;2020-05-07 23:00:00;5 min;Triangle shaped craft traveling silently across the sky. Standing outside looked up and what looked to be a triangle shaped craft.  Lights on the perimeter gave it its shape..  The moon was full slight over cast sky.  Craft was moving slow at approximately 1500 feet.  Got in my truck and was able to follow it as to how slow it was moving.  This made absolutely no sound.   my flight tracker app and no planes in the area.;36.3311;-101.985
