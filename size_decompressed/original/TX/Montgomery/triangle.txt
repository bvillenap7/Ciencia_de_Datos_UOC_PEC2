Let me tell you a little about myself, I grew up on military bases, around all sorts of airplanes jets and what not, I even used to build model planes when I was younger.  Any who, in my experience growing up around all these different  aircrafts, I have never seen one that looked or flew like the one I just saw.  So here's the story, I was on my parents up stairs balcony gradually commiting suicide (smoking a ciggarete in other words),  when all of a sudden accross the lake past the road, out in the forrest (i'm guestimating approximatly 8 miles away) I noticed a light (which at first i thought had to have been a meteor) followed by a triangular shaped hover craft (it was unusually bigger craft)zoom out of an area, of possibly a very remote housing area but more likey is forrestry, it zoomed up about 30 or 40 feet, stopped dead in it's tracks (which i have NEVER seen an aircraft accomplish) then just zoomed out of sight.
