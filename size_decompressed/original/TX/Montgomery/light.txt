At 21:30 (CST) I looked out of my window to see what I thought was a plane. It was a pinpoint of light about twice as bright as venus and had an orange yellow hue. Watching the light from my window I looked for other blinking lights like you normally see on aircraft wings etc. I thoght something was strange when no other lights were visable. Expecting the object to pass over my house I went outside to get a better look, as I had a strange feeling. I spotted the light outside onlt to find it had stopped forward movement but did sway from side to side as if were hovering, much like a helecopter. We ruled out a helecopter because we could not here it nor were ther any other lights around it like you normally see on a helecopter. Also we can't think of a reason why a helecopter would hover at that alltitude in a rural setting. Watching the pinpoint of light for thirty minutes or so I finally went to bed. I woke up at 00:30 (CST) and looked to find the light was now gone.;30.4150561643835;-95.7003465753425

Blue orb emitted loud sound and disappeared in five seconds.;2020-04-12 21:40:00;5 seconds;Blue orb emitted loud sound and disappeared in five seconds. Looking Westbound a blue light appeared in the center of the sky and faded in and traveled North East and faded out.  While this object faded in and out the light emitted was as bright as the sun for a period of 2 seconds and faded back out and emitted a loud humming sound.  The sky was clear and no clouds were in the sky.;30.4150561643835;-95.7003465753425
