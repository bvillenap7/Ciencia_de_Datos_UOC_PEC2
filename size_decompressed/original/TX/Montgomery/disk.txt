A disklike object with two very large, bright yellow lights seen approx 2-3 minutes in Lake Conroe Forest, Montgomery, Texas.;2008-01-24 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;A disklike object with two very large, bright yellow lights seen approx 2-3 minutes in Lake Conroe Forest, Montgomery, Texas. U.F.O. sighting: subdivision: Lake Conroe Forest city/state: Montgomery, Texas zip code: 77316 date: 1/24/08  I am a female, 19 years old, college student at Montgomery/ Lone Star College. At exactly 11:00 P.M., I was driving home on Cheyenne street,(1 street away from my house) when I witnessed a flying disklike object hovering over the trees.  I stared in awe at the object because of its two very large, bright yellow lights symmetrically apart from each other, but definitely attached to the disklike object. I began to slow my truck down and pull onto the side of the road because it looked as if it were very close, almost as if it was going to land in the forest. I was in a rush to get home and seeing this object made me pull over because of it's size, lighting, and location it was hovering. It remained hovering for 2-3 minutes and suddenly vanished. If you have any information on this object I would greatly appreciate some feedback. I have called your hotline in Washington, that was listed on your website ( which i ran to find as soon as i arrived). Thank you for having your website and hotline available;30.4150561643835;-95.7003465753425
Strange object/craft on moon surface;2012-07-31 23:00:00;2 hours;Strange object/craft on moon surface While sitting in my driveway observing the moon through my telescope I noticed a strange object inside a crater that I had not seen before.  I attached my camera to the telescope and took several pictures. The object/craft appears as a disc./dome shape white in color with what appears to be a window or possibly an open ramp on one side casting a shadow.  It was 11:30pm July 30 2012.  This object/craft was there until I stopped watching at 1:00am July 31 2012.I came back out the following evening August 1 2012 and set up the scope and camera,took several pictures of the same location and the object craft is not there anylonger.;30.4150561643835;-95.7003465753425
