Two white round objects flying at a high rate over Lake Conroe, Texas.;2014-07-12 21:05:00;3 seconds;Two white round objects flying at a high rate over Lake Conroe, Texas. Two white objects, like white round lights, flying at a very high rate of speed from one side of the sky to the other side, over Lake Conroe Texas in a matter of two to three seconds.   The two white objects were close together, but not always parallel with each other so they appeared to be independent objects.  There was no noise, like we would experience if a plane was flying overhead.  And they were much faster than a plane. They did not have a trail like a meteor or a shooting star.;30.4150561643835;-95.7003465753425
