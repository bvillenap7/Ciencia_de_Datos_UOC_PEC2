It was a bout 8:15 in the morning just outside of montgomery. We where driving to A&M. I looked out the window of our car when I saw what I though was a star, It was very bright, but then all of the sudden it dimmed out, now it looked like cylinder and it just hung there in the sky for about 45 seconds. Then it just dissaperd I searched the whole sky, nothing it was gone. In total my sighting lasted about 1 minute. After we got home I searched the web for any blimps or planes that might have been over the area... none.;30.4150561643835;-95.7003465753425
