Small metallic sphere that changes into a larger sphere of light.;2013-01-10 12:20:00;7-8 seconds;Small metalic sphere that changes into a larger sphere of light. I was pointing south at 12:20pm when a small metal sphere appeared in my view that 2 seconds later changed into a larger sphere of yellow light about a quarter size of the sun that after 5 or 6 seconds disappeared with a blink of an eye to the left passed the trees I tried to race to an opening to see if I could see it again but it was gone.   I immediately called a friend to discuss what I saw when I found a picture on a social website that friend of mine had taken a few miles from my location that looked Identical to what I saw that was taken just around the same time I witnessed it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite sober-minded and sincere.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  We would welcome a second, corroborating report from the other witness.  PD));30.4150561643835;-95.7003465753425
Witnessed a bright white light shaped like a sphere hovering over pine trees in back yard. No sound, no other lights or color.;2019-03-24 20:00:00;1 minute or less;Witnessed a bright white light shaped like a sphere hovering over pine trees in back yard. No sound, no other lights or color. Stepped into my back yard around 8pm calling my dog to come in.  My dog was standing in the center of the back yard looking up towards the sky growling.  I looked up and saw a bright white light shaped like a sphere.  No other lights or color.  No sound.   It appeared low in the sky, hovering over the pine trees for less than 60 seconds and then took off faster than I could blink my eyes and disappeared.  I can’t begin to describe the speed.  I’ve never witnessed that before.;30.4150561643835;-95.7003465753425
