Large red fire ball and several white lights.;2013-02-26 08:30:00;hour;Large red fire ball and several white lights. I was sitting out on the back porch looking to the trees on the back side of our property (south). When I saw a fire ball red in color float between the trees then dart out of sight.   As that happen I got a glimpse of white lights dancing around, about ten of them in the area of the red ball.   I called my wife out to make sure I was not seeing things and she confirmed that the lights were there. Sortly after our TV went haywire then stoped.  This lasted about an hour then the lights disappeared.;30.7733;-94.4114
