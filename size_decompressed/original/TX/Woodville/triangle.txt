I was in the back seat, passenger side, when I noticed a large object decending from well above the tree line. It came down very fast in a verticle decent. It disappered behind the trees about five miles before you get to woodville on hwy 190. After I saw the craft I felt very sick and nausiated but it eventually went away. I looked up about 3 min. later and saw hundreds of (what looked like otherships) flying east accross the constalation Orion. After the sighting of the first ship our car radio went off for a few seconds.;30.7733;-94.4114
