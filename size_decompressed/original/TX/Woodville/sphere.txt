We went out in the field about 12am, behind our home to watch the meteor shower.   We were out there for about 40 minutes when we seen two objects appear to our north one became brighter and brighter and brighter as if it was shining a light towards us.  At that time my daughter and I seen one of the objects shoot a green orb of light out in a southwest direction it kept traveling and then disappeared.    We observed the objects with binoculars (7 X 35) power not the best but gave a good look at the objects.  As they moved North East the object that became bright started to dim to same as the other object.  The objects keep moving North East than stopped on a dime and stood there for a couple of minutes before disappearing.   We know what we witnessed were not meteors but objects under controlled flight.  Having prior military service and train! ing to identify different types of air craft, I can say the objects we no air plane or helicopter.;30.7733;-94.4114

Low Floating sphere.;2019-10-09 20:45:00;5 minutes;Low Floating sphere Seen a low flying bright sphere that was traveling in a West to East direction.  We initially thought it was a low flying plane, but there was no sound and no lights that blinked.  The way it flew was a floating type and changed direction to southeast.  The sphere seem to watch us as we fallowed it behind a tree, it turned red and disappeared.  There was some satellites and planes in the area that did not compare to what we seen.  Strange object and seemed aware we were watching it as it seem to watch us.;30.7733;-94.4114
