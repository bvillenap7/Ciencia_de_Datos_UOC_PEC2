PD));2016-05-28 21:30:00;not/known;June 12, 2016  A UFO was photographed in my back yard, May 28, 2016, at 9:30 PM.  It was caught on my game night camera.  I live outside of town, and I am concerned about our pet's safety from coyotes. It would seem to be about two feet in diameter and maybe three inches in thickness.  It seemed to be a circle. I have one photo which I lightened on my computer.  It was a very dark night.  I can see from that improvement it is inside my yard. I wonder if this can be a drone?   Please share information regarding this UFO if there is any. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photo, and suspect that the object is not an alien space craft.  The quality of the copy sent to NUFORC is not high, but it appears to us as though the object of interest is in the near field of the camera, and probably is relatively small.  PD));30.7733;-94.4114
