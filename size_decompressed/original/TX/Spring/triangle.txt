large triangle craft spotted 2 witnesses;2008-09-03 20:05:00;1 MINUTE;large triangle craft spotted 2 witnesses I was driving about 9 pm on a thursday and my friend and i both at the same time saw a very large triangle about 75 to 100 yards in diameter hovering about 50 feet above the house roofs many lights surrounded the vessel no sound was heard we both described the same thing we saw one light comming out of a flap pointing toward the ground it was very bright like looking into the sun. Then we tried to turn around to get another look and it took off very slow seeming to take an abnormal path not straight then suddenly there was no more lights and it was gone through this whole thing there was no sound what so ever. We had our windows open and it was a very bright and clear night nothing can explain this.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
Multiple bright lights traveling southeast with one flyover.;2013-03-23 22:30:00;10 minutes;Multiple bright lights traveling southeast with one flyover. I live in Spring, Texas.  I was in my backyard with my dogs somewhere between 10:15 and 10:45pm Saturday March 23, 2013.  I noticed what looked like a bright reddish light approaching high in the northwest and moving towards the southeast.  The light was singular and had no additional lights like the blinking lights you’d normally see on aircraft.  Still in the northwest, the light appeared to slow, then almost rise up and disappear into the cloud cover. I took one dog in the house and returned to stay with my second one. Looking back to the Northwest I noticed another two lights travelling in the same southeast direction.  Thinking that the first one was odd, I decided to keep my focus on these next lights to see what they did.  The two lights were not too close to one another spaced almost like aircraft that are in a specific flight pattern when coming into an airport.  The lead light (again a singular light) started out red and became a little whiter as it got closer.  Originally I thought this was because of the cloud cover, atmospheric conditions, etc.  It too disappeared into the cloud cover, but I decided to keep focused on the sky where it disappeared.  Within a few seconds, a black mass appeared in the sky moving in the same path as the light.  It was low and continued on the same southeast trajectory.   It moved silently in the sky over my house, right above me and continued southwest, disappearing over the horizon.  The mass was black against the low cloud cover and low.  It was t! riangular shape although not defined (like that of a fuselage and wings).  There was no sound as it passed over or preceding it after it disappeared. Whatever the object was, it was fairly low and moved at a steady pace to the southeast.  There was no visible light at this point on the object.  The moon was partially visible through the upper cloud cover.  The object was a solid black mass.  At the altitude it was at, I’m guessing the size of a small jet, but again appearing solid and flat from my vantage point.  I also observed two more of these ‘fireball type lights’ that seemed higher in the sky in the northwest. These were also travelling toward the southeast.  The final two that I observed, were not visible together.  One appeared and disappeared in the cloud cover in the northwest and then the second, also disappearing in the high cloud cover in the northeast.  Each of these appeared to slightly move west right before they disappeared.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
