Me and my wife and our friend were outside looking at the stars.  We all saw the same light thinging it was a shooting star.  It changed direction a few times but always moved foward in right angles.  as we watched the object move across teh sky our friend elisha screamed out that she saw another one crosing the path of the first.  They did a criss cross motion and dissapeared suddenly.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
3 stars moving in a triangular formation accross a very clear sky;2004-07-05 23:30:00;approx 7 min;3 stars moving in a triangular formation accross a very clear sky My brother and his girlfriend were outside smoking when my brother saw 3 star-like objects moving, north to south, slowly through the sky in a greater than symbol (>) formation.  I was already in bed, but my brother woke me up.  By the time i got outside (maybe a minute) the formation had moved to the far south side of the sky.  For the minute i was outside, i saw the formation increase its speed and altitude, until each star seemed to reach an altitude that was no longer visible.  One star at a time disappeared, in succession until they were all 3 gone.  If you weren't paying attention, you would not have noticed them moving.  They looked exactly like stars, they were shimmering and their altitude gave them a slow moving illusion.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
It was probably a meteor, but while viewing the International Space Station we saw something unusual.;2008-04-12 20:55:00;5 to 10 seconds;It was probably a meteor, but while viewing the International Space Station we saw something unusual. My son and I were outside tonight to view the International Space Station as it passed overhead. At approx. 8:55 central time we spotted the ISS. Almost instantly below it a light flicked into view and shot across the sky. Shot is not really the correct word. It did not seem very fast. It was very unusual that we saw this possible meteor at the same the ISS came into view. This meteor was also perpendicular to the ISS. Another unusual thing is I thought meteors usually entered the atomsphere from the east heading west. This one entered low from the north heading south. Here is the viewing info for the ISS from the NASA site ISS Sat Apr 12/08:54 PM 2 min 24 degrees max elev 11 degrees approach above NNW 24 above NE This might help to solve this small mystery. My house blocked out most of the mystery lights travel, so I am not sure how far it went. I can tell you from the time it appeared it was steady and not blinking and it traveled straight across the sky, not appearing to change in elevation at all. I guess it is possible for a meteor to enter the atomsphere at an elevation lower than the ISS travels.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
over 20 objects moving at different speeds some in triangle patterns to the norhtwest;2008-12-31 20:15:00;3 min;over 20 objects moving at different speeds some in triangle patterns to the norhtwest a formation of orange lights moving at different speeds to the northwest.  NO sound of engines.  Looked like a roman candle ball burning but the light did not dim.  Some of the objects were in a triangle formation too.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
UFO in Texas, Strange star like light in the sky .;2009-02-15 21:00:00;15 minutes;UFO in Texas, Strange star like light in the sky . February 15, 2009 Spring, Texas   I went outside to smoke a cigarette and I was sitting on the tailgate of my truck. I looked up to the stars and there was a very bright object in the sky. As I was admiring the star it began to slowly drift to the left, then the object stopped moving and began to shoot to the right. It continued this strange flight pattern for several minutes I run into the house to get my girlfriend and her little brother and they too witnessed this object in the sky above Spring, Texas. This is the FOURTH UFO I have witnessed with similar shape and flight patterns/capabilities. I feel crazy for Knowing i have seen these things and would like to get some real info on what these guys are. Letter to Obama?;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
Travebright white light with flashing white light. Traveling in straight line from south to north.;2012-09-14 22:00:00;1 minute;bright white light with flashing white light. Traveling in straight line from south to north. I was in my backyard a few weeks ago about 10 pm and spotted a bright white light with a blinking white light.  My wife has seen the same thing 4 other times. It always appears in the same location, it comes from the south and flies north.  I am a commercial pilot and fly for a major airline. I live close to Houston Bush Intercontinental airport.  I know what an airplane looks like flying in the night sky and this was no airplane. It had no navigation or red beacon lights as all airplanes are required to have. When I first saw it I thought it was the International Space Station or a satellite (I have seen both from my backyard many times).  This was bigger, about the size of an aspirin.  Then I saw the flashing white light and thought it was an airplane but it had no red/green navigational lights.  I see airplanes flying at low and high altitude from my backyard and you can see the navigational lights and know that its an airplane.  This was totally different. Im w! ondering if it is some kind of spy drone.  It made no noise and it was difficult to judge the altitude but I would guess it was at least 50,000 ft. It was traveling in a straight line and about the speed of a satellite.  I lost sight of it as it flew over the horizon and behind the trees. We look for it almost every night.  My wife tried taking pictures but its too high in the sky to get a clear shot of it. I wish I had a camera with a high power telescopic lens.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
Blue and red lights in sky over suburban Spring, Tx.;2014-04-01 23:30:00;20 minutes;Blue and red lights in sky over suburban Spring, TX. From my bedroom window, I could see a blue and red light making a circle in the sky.  I almost ignored it till I realized it was not a reflection (No tv or light on in my room).   Watched as red light shot off west and blue one arced downward.   Told husband who suggested kids with roman candles trying to be funny, but there was no sound to go with it (and the lights were close enough where, if they had been fireworks, there would have been noticable bangs).    A few minutes later, the lights were back.  Red light made a big circle while the blue one hovered, then arced downward again.   This happened twice more, in slightly different locations (like they were moving in a pattern towards the west).   Around 23:50, they vanished.  Watched until after midnight but no more lights. Witnesses were myself (female, age 36, master's degree, writer stay at home mom) and my husband (32, male, aerospace/aviation engineer by training and teacher currently).   The weather was overcast and humid and the geography is the edge of the Gulf Coast where it runs into the Pineywoods.   We're in suburban neighborhood but with woods and a huge state park nearby, along with several creeks and a river. The lights themselves looked about the size of a car headlight when seen from my bedroom window, in terms of size not brightness.   We do live near an airport but I can guarantee, as can my aerospace/aviation engineer husband, plane and helicopter lights do not behave like this.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
A blue-ish green light was seen flying north east at high speed and a relatively low altitude.;2014-07-12 21:30:00;2;At first glance this looked like a shooting star.  A blue-ish green light was seen flying north east at high speed and a relatively low altitude.   The craft either had two lights (both the same color) or three were two close flying crafts.   The craft(s) was completely silent, flying faster than any craft, drone or commercial, that has flown before.   We followed it until it disappeared past the tree line.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
Two lights moving slowly changing colors from white to purple to red near Spring Tx on 10/2/14 apprx 2358 hrs.;2014-10-02 23:58:00;1.3 minutes;Two lights moving slowly changing colors from white to purple to red near Spring Tx on 10/2/14 apprx 2358 hrs. I went outside for a cigarette and saw two lights slowly moving around NNW of my house. The best I can tell is the objects were round but were either quite a distance away or quite small.  My best guess would be they were apprx 2K feet away. The lights changed colors from white to purple to red.  I called my wife out to look and she witnessed them as well.  I have a .mov I got with my Iphone I'll send with this.  When the lights dropped below tree line a thunderstorm rolled through within a minute.  I have 31 years with the Air Force and the FAA and have been around aviation most of my life.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
4 white glows in the cloud cover circling like sparrows within a 1/4 mile.;2016-08-30 22:30:00;1 hour;4 white glows in the cloud cover circling like sparrows within a 1/4 mile. 4 independent lights approx 20' in diam glowed in the clouds and circled irradicly but stayed in a circle diam of 1/4 mile radius moving at unbelievable speeds, silent and changing direction.   Got tired of watching them went to bed with them still going.   Wife saw them as said someone is shinning lights on the clouds with a bright light.  So i went around the area to see who was doing it, found no one around but me. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the time above.
