I was out on my side walk when a saw a white cone shaped steeple coming out of the retention pond a few yards away.  I jumped the fence and what a saw amazed me!  The normally brown murky water was clear like the ocean in Hawaii.  The UFO had no water dripping off of it and there were no ripples in the pond.  I looked at the top of it and my eyes went black for 5 seconds.  When I could see again it was still there.  I ran inside to tell my mom and brother.  But when we came out it was as if it was never there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  Date is flawed.  PD));30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
