fast/manuevering UFO over Spring, Tx. on night of 5/10/02, 10pm;2002-05-10 22:00:00;1 minute;fast/manuevering UFO over Spring, Tx. on night of 5/10/02, 10pm At approx. 10p (central) over Spring, Tx. (approx. 21 mi. north of downtown Houston, off I-45), I went out on our outside apartment patio to smoke, and after I sat down, I looked up and saw an object moving from left to right in the south sky (moving east to southwest). My immediate reaction was that it had to be an aircraft, but when it suddenly stopped on a dime, and stayed in one place, my changed very quickly about what I was seeing. I wanted to go tell my sister, but was afraid it would go away, and I'd miss what it would do next. I waited then, and it then started moving in a straight line to the east, from it's stationary position I seen it move to. It was then I knew I better get my sister, so at least someone else could see this. My sister came out in time to also watch this dimly lit white object continue to move, more rapidly now in a straight line to the east. This thing was definitely going MUCH faster than any commercial airliner, or Air Force jet ! We watched it getting farther to the east, when suddenly it stopped ! -- and I mean it stopped on a dime, too... about 10 seconds of sitting there, it then started moving back towards us (southwest), but this time it was moving slower....it moved towards us for about 15 seconds, then turned around and started going east again ! It continued at the same slower speed (but still very fast for any flying craft we have - or at least anything to our knowledge that we have).....It kept going this time, moving eastward till we couldnt see it anymore. We waited around 10 mins. for it to come back, but it didnt, and it was a very hot humid night here in Houston, anyway. I went at got the binoculars and will keep them outside from now on. I have a feeling that whoever was contolling this thing, they know they could really go faster than the speed we seen it move..... :) I hope anybody else seen this last night will also come forward. PS : There was a commercial jet flying west to east, much lower than the UFO, but they wouldve had no problem seeing this on such a clear night if they just looked upto their left.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
Large, glowing bright circular object moving accross sky. No sound or strobe lights. Slowly moving & then sped up & vanished;2008-08-09 21:00:00;15 min;Large, glowing bright circular object moving accross sky. No sound or strobe lights. Slowly moving & then sped up & vanished My husband and I were outside on Saturday, August 9, 2008 at our home in Spring, TX. We were looking at the moon when we noticed another object in the sky. It was a circular ball of light, very bright like the moon. There were no strobe lights on the object and there was no sound, so we knew that it wasnâ€™t a regular air craft. It was moving in a south eastern direction. It moved like a satellite but was clearly in our atmosphere. It was traveling at a lower distance than the air craft in the area usually do.  It seemed to glide in the sky, then it sped up.  We watched it through the trees and over the houses.  The light suddenly got dimmer and dimmer until it vanished completely.  We could not identify what it was. W e do live near IAH Bush Airport. A jet came from the opposite direction a few minutes after the object disappeared which was easily identifiable due to the strobe lights and sound.

They were fluttering back and forward.  They arched the line a little bit and then flew out into the sky and disappeared.  They looked like dim lighted ovals in the sky, no markings or bulky items just very dim balls of light.  They passed by the apartments pond for about 30 seconds to a minute and then they went to far for us to see.   There was no sound coming from any of them.  There was also a very bright shooting star that flew across the sky just seconds before the objects strolled on by.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
Red and orange orbs.;2017-05-27 21:00:00;2 minutes;Red and orange orbs On the eve of May 27, 2017, 9pm, my family and i were out looking at the moon thru the telescope we had bought for our son for his 8th birthday that friday.  When my nephew started yelling look look over there what is that flying.   When i turned around we saw the 1st orb looked like fire red and orange glow fly by tree top lvl abot 50 feet in the air.  Flying very fast and moving in all directions very quickly.   I knew i had to film, it so i pulled out my camera phone. While doing so other people in passing by cars and people walking by started yelling what are those.  A second orb same color and size flew in at a faster rate and chased the 1st orb turn by turn they seemed to dance.   I finely got my phone to record and only caught the second one, but was very excited to capture it before they flew off into the sky.  They made no noise at all.  And the orbs were so bright not sure what we saw, but hope others will see this and have more info;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
