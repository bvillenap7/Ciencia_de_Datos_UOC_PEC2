It was a clear morning without a cloud in the sky. I looked above the tree line about 800-1000 ft is the air was an object in the sky.  It was pure silver in color.   It seemed to be hovering.  I saw it for about 15 seconds until I had a tree line obstruct my view.   When I passed tree line, the object vanished.  I looked all around for it.  I even saw an airplane and noticed the shape I saw was not the same and was definitely not moving.   After a few miles I looked up again and saw it again.  It was there for approximately 15 seconds.  I took my eyes off of it for a split second and it was gone.   I have never been a believer, but this was surreal.   The object was like a cross between an egg and a large bell and silver in color.  I would guess it was a diameter of about 12 feet.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
