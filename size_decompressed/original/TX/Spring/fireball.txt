The sky;2014-03-28 19:00:00;15 minutes;I walked outside my house at night to smoke a cigarette, and I saw a ball of green light.  It seemed to almost look electrical.   The sky was clear all around it, and the ball it self was almost a lime or emerald green.  I called my mother to tell her what I was seeing in my backyard.   I was not scared I just had no idea what it was.  It did not even occur to me to take a picture!   I had watched some shows on television and I just so happened to see the same thing!  The only difference was the person reported that it was white.  I immediately called and asked my mom if she remembered my phone call about the abject I had seen, and she said she remembered when I had called.   I have never seen anything like this in my life.  What was weird about it is I did not feel scared as I was staring at the object.  It was there the entire time I was outside, which was possibly 15 minutes.   In addition, I got the feeling I should go inside, not that I was scared, just that it was time to go inside, I never saw it again.

3 red glowing lights fireball objects moving north to south in Houston area moving about 2 minutes apart in same flight path.;2015-01-04 18:20:00;8 minutes;3 red glowing lights fireball objects moving north to south in Houston area moving about 2 minutes apart in same flight path. It's dark outside around 6-7pm on Sunday night, Jan. 4, 2015.  Spouse comes in from the back patio and a little excited tells me he saw an object moving pretty low from the north across the sky over the recently cleared property behind our house.   Here's his description:  A big ball of fire with ropes moving in the wind and hanging down with balls of fire!  First thought was: meteor.  No, maybe a weather balloon on fire and falling?  We live very close to the big intercontinental airport and there were lots of aircraft landing at the time they are low and you can see the entire plane with blinking lights. I go to the front yard facing south.  I see a glowing red object like it was on fire and in the same flight path as the first object which spouse saw flying north to south.  About 2 to 4 minutes later I saw the third object.   These objects were not the average aircraft like I saw flying to land at the airport.  These objects were not on a path to land like the other aircraft.  The 3 objects all followed the same path and same speed.  These objects were not ordinary but appeared strange.  Pics on my I phone were blurry.  Thought about the Bible stories of the 'chariots of fire'.  No idea what they were.  Anyone else see them?   My digital panel on the back of my stove has been out for several weeks and several hours after incident the digital clock on the panel was working. My husband has worked in construction for about 40 years and is in supervision. I am a homemaker and we have raised 3 children and we have 6 grandchldren.  We have been married 40 years and are both in our late 50's.  We are Christians and I really don't believe in extra terrestrials.  I have never seen anything like this before!;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
7 fireballs take exact path in sky at intervals.;2015-01-24 23:15:00;8-10 minutes;7 fireballs take exact path in sky at intervals. Walking dog in neighborhood I noticed 1st reddish what appeared like a ball of fire.  It did not ascend but just appeared in sky.  About 40 sec later a 2nd and another 40 sec a 3rd.  They took exact same path.  About 3-4 min later it happened again like the aforementioned.  Then 3-4 min later it was just 1 but same appearance and same path as previous 6.   I am a pilot so know aircraft lighting configurations and they were not aircraft and it was very quiet, no noise of jets.   I thought maybe those Chinese lanterns, but they did not ascend from ground, just suddenly appeared in sky, approx. 45 degrees from horizon.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
Orange lights from Northeast to Southwest.;2016-01-23 18:45:00;15:00;orange lights from Northeast to Southwest My husband pulled into our driveway from the store, walked into the house to tell me about seeing 4 orange lights outside he wondered if it could be Unmanned Aircraft.   Not immediately, but a few minutes later I walked outside to take my son to a school event.  Waiting in the driveway, I looked up to see if I saw what my husband mentioned.  I saw just 1 orange light.  It was to the right of Orionâ€™s belt (the 3-stars in a row).  It was dark, but I saw a dark gray cloud cover the orange light briefly, making it seem to have disappeared or gone dimmer.   Not thinking much of it, I did not stay to watch longer.  It was cold and we were on our way, running just a bit behind, we left at about 7:05 p.m. Central Time.   At 10 p.m. we walked outside together, the moon have moved up much higher and no orange lights in view.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
