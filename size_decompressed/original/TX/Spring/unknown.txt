Object with red/green/white light flew over Montgomery County, Tx., moving south to north...on 5/28/00;2000-05-28 21:15:00;10 minutes;Object with red/green/white light flew over Montgomery County, Tx., moving south to north...on 5/28/00 We live in Spring, Tx., which is near the border of Harris and Montgomery Counties, 25 mi. north of downtown Houston. At approx. 9:15pm, my sister asked to come outside to look at something in the sky - she was looking at it with naked eye and binoculars. I went outside and there it was -- approx. 20 - 30,000 feet up (about the highest a commercial jet is that you can see). The object was lit up with green, red, and white light. We couldn't make out the shape of it, being so high and far away, and object was about size of the north star on a clear night. We could tell it wasn't a jet or helicopter, as it didn't have lights that blinked like commercial aviation craft, instead the lights on it just seemed to be moving (too far away to tell if they were blinking in sequence, etc.). Through the binoculars, we could definitely see the red, green, and white lights on it, the red and green lights being brighter than the white. The craft was slowly moving north from south slowly, which we knew, because it was slowly getting dimmer as it went. We couldn't tell how many miles object was from us because of the height, but could tell it wasn't too far away -- either it wasn't that far, or it was probably very bright, which made it easier to see. We live right next to Montgomery County line, so actually, the object was over Montgomery County, approx. over The Woodlands area, when we first saw it. As we were watching this thing, something else much closer, and lower, suddenly came from the east to the west flying about the cruising speed of a helicopter, was all white (or possibly light green), and was only about 1000 ft. up, and didn't have lights of helicopter blinking, but rather just the whole thing was blinking on and off... this second craft we watched for only 10 seconds, and it just simply dissapeared...din't go behind anything obscuring our view -- we actually saw it just vanish... The first craft finally became dimmer and dimmer as it slowly moved northward over Montgomery county, till it was too far to see it anymore, and then trees, etc. were in the way.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
There were pulsed white light surrounding an object with circular blue lights with a ring of red and white light underneath.;2003-11-02 00:30:00;1 minute;There were pulsed white light surrounding an object with circular blue lights with a ring of red and white light underneath. My husband and I were driving home on Gosling Road in Spring Texas last night (11-02-03) just after midnight.  The car in front of us approximately 1/4 mile ahead slammed on their brakes and turned and sped off the road quickly.  My husband asked me if I saw the strange lightening in the sky. I didn't think it was lightening because it was white pulsing flashes. I thought it must be from a tower. But neither of us had ever noticed a tower on this road before. As we drove closer to the light I looked up out the passenger car window and witnessed 5 or 6 circular blue lights in a semi-circle. Underneath the blue lights were a red and white ring of pulsing lights. The pulsed white light illuminating from the object and flashed across the sky. The light pulsed every few seconds. I couldn't see the shape of the object because it was too dark. I only saw it for a couple seconds and it was gone. The white lightening was also gone. All my husband saw was a flash of blue lights within the white light then nothing.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
Approx. 10 amber colored objects flying in formation in a clear night sky.;2013-12-24 22:00:00;2 minutes;Approx. 10 amber colored objects flying in formation in a clear night sky. Several amber colored objects were flying in a pattern, observed behind some pine trees at first, very near us in a clear night sky.  Total number of objects approximately 10.  Elevation maybe 5000 feet. At first we thought it was fireworks or maybe light poles from a sporting event.  However, as we passed the pine trees it was obvious there was no arena and no sporting event and it was not fireworks falling from the sky.  Instead the objects were slowly moving away from us, staying in formation, moving in a north to northwest direction.  Each object seemed to have several lights on it, all seemed amber colored. Exact shape of each object not clear. There were three of us in the car, all seeing the same thing.  We tried to stop and get a picture, but there were a of couple light poles in the parking lot we pulled into, and the white light from those poles flooded the sky and washed out the amber lights.  Meanwhile the amber objects were fading into the distance.  Maybe 2 minutes total time had elapsed from our first observation.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
