This image was recorded around 12:30AM this morning from my Xfinity camera, which is attached to my garage. At first I thought it was a moth, which is common to see on my cameras many evenings and early mornings. When I slowed down the footage, I noticed the object was oval in appearance, and that made me think about a similar image I had seen on my front door camera. Thanks for taking time to check this out.;30.1039507607194;-95.4736309820193
