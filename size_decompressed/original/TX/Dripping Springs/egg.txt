In the southeastern sky there was an egg-shaped, bright chartreuse green object with a very bright white halo that was thin in front and forming a thick, single contrail to the back that extended a long distance across the sky. It moved very rapidly parallel with the horizon from south to east and disappeared behind a large thunder storm cloud. It did not reappear on the other side of the cloud. The duration of the event was only a few seconds. The light emitted by the object was greater than that of a full moon and lit up the bedroom. A parrot screamed from another part of the house having been awakened by the bright light. The residence is in a remote, country setting with no street lights or nearby house lights or through roads. It almost seemed like a meteor except that it was a relatively large bright green oval and moved across the sky parallel to the ground as opposed to intersecting it.;30.2260999999999;-98.1003999999997
