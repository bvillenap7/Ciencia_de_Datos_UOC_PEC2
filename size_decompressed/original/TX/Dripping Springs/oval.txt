On Thursday evening in the sky over Dripping Springs, Texas my daughter, I, and three of my daughter’s friends witnessed a pulsating light fly over at 8:49pm CST. It came from the southwestern horizon and less than a minute later disappeared into the eastern horizon. It was slowly pulsating bright and dim and there were no clouds in the sky. It appeared larger than a star, but smaller than Venus. At maximum elevation about half way through the sighting I would estimate that it was about 50 degrees.  At the beginning and end of the sighting may have been about 45 degrees. The sighting lasted about 45 seconds. It did not leave a visible trail. The Hays County Sheriff, Austin American Statesman, and KVUE TV said they have had no other reports of this incident.;30.2260999999999;-98.1003999999997
