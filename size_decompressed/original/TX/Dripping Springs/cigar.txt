Intense bright white light that turned into cigar-shaped object seen in daylight outside of Austin, TX.;2013-12-03 10:00:00;8 minutes;Intense bright white light that turned into cigar-shaped object seen in daylight outside of Austin, TX On 12/03/13 at approximately 10 a.m., I saw a round, intensely bright white light in the north sky.  The sky was blue, no clouds.   I was at the end of our driveway, so I walked back to my husband and jokingly asked “is that a UFO?”  By the time I turned around, the object had turned west and changed to a cigar shaped object that we could not identify.   My husband went in the house for his binoculars.  The object made no sound, was moving fairly slowly, and was too high up to be a helicopter.  An airplane was also in the sky to the east and south of, and higher in the sky than, the object, moving west.   When my husband looked at the object with his binoculars, he said it was like an elongated oval, with a thinner elongated oval above it but not seeming to be attached to it.  He did not see any lights on it, and said the color was off-white.   Then all of a sudden it disappeared.  The longitude/latitude of the sighting was 30°15’05.04”N / 98°03’47.86”W and the object was probably 2000 ft. high or more.;30.2260999999999;-98.1003999999997
