Large red light observed which disappeared followed by small light moving erratically against stars.;2014-08-20 21:40:00;3-4 minutes;Large red light observed which disappeared followed by small light moving erratically against stars. At the time provided I sat on my deck, talking to a friend by iPhone.  I absent-mindedly was watching the clear night sky as I visited with my friend.  Looking eastward, approximately 75 degrees, almost straight overhead, I saw a red light suddenly appear, high in the heavens.  If I held my hand in front of my face, the light would appear to be 2-3 cm across in relation to my thumb.  It was difficult to judge the size of the object because it was so far away.  This light was bright red, and it manifested itself for approximately 2-3, seconds before it just as suddenly disappeared. I judge the intensity of the light in this fashion, on a scale from 1 to 10:  if overhead blinking red lights on passing airplanes appear to me to be on a scale of 2-3, this light I judged to be an 8 or 9.  It was that much brighter than regular airplane lights. The light was stationary. After the light disappeared, I then observed, for the next 1-2 minutes, a minute white light (scale: 1-2, barely discernible) moving quickly first due north, then stopping, then moving  at a right angle west, then stopping, and moving diagonally back to the south.  The movements were jerky and non- linear-that is to say, not in the smooth  and straight fashion of an airplane.  Then this little light disappeared. The total amount of time from the sudden appearance of the larger red light until the smaller white light disappeared was approximately 2-3 minutes.
