Noiseless glowing oval shaped white light traveling in straight line at unreal speed just over treetops;2008-10-19 19:00:00;seconds;Noiseless glowing oval shaped white light traveling in straight line at unreal speed just over treetops I was sitting at my computer, which is at a window, when a large oval shaped glowing light flew past just over the treetops.  It was going so fast I had to jump up out of my chair and run to the wall on the other side of the room (5 feet away) to see it disappear over the treetops heading west.   It was completely soundless.  Like a lightbulb the glow kept you from being able to see the definite shape of the craft, but it was a solid glow (white), not blinking, and definitely faster than any plane.  The glow was oval shaped and didn't change shape.   It didn't go up or down, it just FLEW past in a straight line just over the treetops.  There would have been no time to call for someone else to see it if they had been in the next room.  No time to get a pic if the camera was right on my desk!   It was awesome!  But scary too.
