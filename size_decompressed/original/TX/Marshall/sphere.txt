Driving eastbound on I-20 just outside of Marshall, Texas I initially spotted three blue spheres with a small comet like trail behing them coming out over a grove of trees (I believe the trail was a visual effect as a result of their speed and not anything physical).    They appeared individually within fractions of a second of one other coming from the north and heading south.  It appeared as if they all paused for a fraction of a second until all three were directly over the interstate approximately half a mile ahead of me in the horizon.  Once all three were in sight they took off in a slightly different vector but still heading south.  Approximately 3-5 seconds later, two more appeared out of the same direction with the same pause and go route to the south.  From the distance they were from me (approx. half a mile head unsure of altitude but definitely lower than 500ft) they were about soccer ball size in scale. My first thought before really processing the info was fireworks but the angle they appeared over the trees along with the pause, direction change and speed made this very unlikely.  They flew in exacting lines, no arching and there was the obvious pause and go as if they were waiting on their wingman to catch up.  Additionally, the speed at which they appeared and then flashed across the sky from the distance they were from me was too fast for fireworks or even a low flying aircraft.  They were gone across the sky faster than I could turn my head to follow them.;32.5215864864865;-94.3309702702704
