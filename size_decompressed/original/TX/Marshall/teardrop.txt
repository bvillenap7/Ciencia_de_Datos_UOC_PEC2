Between 9 and 10pm. A green strip turning red while travling west to east and fading out in east sky. It was a black sky in the north at this time with a very light fog. It was like the shuttle re-entering. Would like to know what this could have been, not aware of shuttle landing.;32.5215864864865;-94.3309702702704
