Orange fiery disk flying at tree level;1994-10-15 23:15:00;5 seconds;Orange fiery disk flying at tree level I was a college student at the time of the event, coming back from a day at the lake.  It was dark, and I was driving on Loop 390 in Marshall, TX, close to the interection with FM 1997.  I saw a bright object out of the corner of my eye, and looked in time to see an orange disk fly across the sky in front of my car.  The disk appeared to be flaming, was traveling north, and moved over the horizon very quickly.  A rushing sound accompanied the moving object.  It was traveling at  about tree level and was larger than a car.  I have not reported the sight until a friend told me she had seen an object matching my description in Fall 1997, hovering in the vicinity of the object I had observed.  She reports that the object moved up and down, the came toward her before flying north at high speed.;32.5215864864865;-94.3309702702704
