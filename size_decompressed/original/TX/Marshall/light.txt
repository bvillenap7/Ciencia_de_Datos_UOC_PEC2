Very bright light in sky.  Not a star or a planet.  Couldn't tell how high above the ground it was but it was at least as high as an airplane would fly.  It hovered, and when it moved it moved fairly quickly and only short distances.  We saw at least 15 objects that seemed like meteors fall in the area of the sky around the light.  The light would move up and down, left to right, come closer and farther away and it would move in small tight circles.  Light from the object seemed to reach the ground.  It seemed as if the object might have been over towards Shreveport, Louisiana and Barksdale AFB but I could not be for sure.;32.5215864864865;-94.3309702702704
