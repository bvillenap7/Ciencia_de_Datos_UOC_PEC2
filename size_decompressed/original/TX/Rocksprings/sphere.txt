Unknown Sphere's. 2 separate sightings.One on camera;2020-10-10 05:43:00;Unknown;Unknown Sphere's. 2 separate sightings.One on camera Not sure if this is worth reporting or not.  We have a ranch down around Leakey Texas, way , way out away from the city. Earlier this year, Myself, my wife and another couple were sitting out side and we saw a ball of light coming toward us. It appeared to be about the size of a softball and about 50’ in the sky.  It came directly toward us, made a hard 90 to the right, went about 100 yards and made a 45 to the right.  No sound, no other lights, etc. We have game cameras up at the ranch and have caught one on camera.  Just curios to know what these are.  I’m not sure how to post the picture so if ya’ll have an interest please contact me and I will send a pic. As a side note, I am a private pilot and have studied weather, aircraft, etc. and I have never seen anything like this.  Regards,;30.0226;-100.2323
