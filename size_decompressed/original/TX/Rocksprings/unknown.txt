Irregular Flight Patterns and color changes. Was out on the hunting lease with another person waiting in camp for the other two guys to get back from dropping off their meat at the processor.  We decided to turn the lights off in the cabin and sit outside to see if we could see any shooting stars as we were about 25 minutes outside of the city limits.  Then the guy who i was with started to say that he was seeing something moving in the horizon.  I didn't believe him for the first 15 minutes. (Thought he was trying to scare me since the lights were off).  But eventually I gave in and looked over to see what he was talking about.  Then I saw what he was talking about.  It was several miles away.  Looked like a rather bright star but was right on the horizon moving around in a very irregular flight pattern.  While watching, it also started to slowly change colors that alternated between: Green, Red, and Blue.  Couldnt see anything through the binoculars as even with those it was too far away.  Woke up early that morning (about 9 hours later) to go out to the deer blind and all the stars were covered by clouds except that one and it was still moving in its irregular pattern going up down left and right. Got some video on my cell phone but it is hard to focus at night.;30.0226;-100.2323
