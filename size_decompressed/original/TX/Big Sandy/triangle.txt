Triangle, colored lights, cow mutilations, disappeared.;1974-10-15 20:00:00;90 minutes;Triangle, colored lights, cow mutilations, disappeared. I had a reflector telescope and was search the night sky for planets.  Just above the northern horizon, I saw an odd looking star.  I turned my telescope toward it and focused in.   What I saw was a triangle (upright) with yellow, blue, red, white lights.  There was also a mist falling downward from the object (like you might see coming off a refrigerator freezer in high humidity when you open the door).  There was also a halo around the object.  I ran to the house and got my uncle.  He looked too and say the same thing.  We observed the object for the next 1.4 hours.  It did not move and we went inside after it disappeared (as if the lights just turned off). At that time in East Texas, we had many cow mutilations and the next morning, the farm report told of a cow mutilation in the same area where we say this object. I did not see the object again even after monitoring the next two nights. Thanks;32.6168;-95.088
