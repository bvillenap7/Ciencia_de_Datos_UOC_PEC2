Silent, high speed amber oval, high altitude, no beacon lights, no contrail, heading straight west by northwest.;1999-06-30 21:00:00;12 seconds;Silent, high speed amber oval, high altitude, no beacon lights, no contrail, heading straight west by northwest. Looking north along beach as object crossed beach, angle of altitude was about 45 degrees. Object crossed 90 degrees of arc in 8 seconds, continued in straight line another 4 seconds until sight obstructed by building. First sighted about 45 degrees to the right of north, out over the water too far away to be light reflected off seagull breast ( my first thought)Estimated speed due to various guesses  of altitude, distance, etc. between 3,000 and 6,000 mph. Possibly heading, in my opinion, toward Del Rio, El Paso, or Southern California passing over sparsly populated part of Texas. I think it was military. Do not believe in aliens.;26.0539;-97.3125
