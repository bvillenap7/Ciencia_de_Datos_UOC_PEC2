Silver cylinder crossing the sky in one minute.;2015-12-17 11:00:00;60 seconds;Silver cylinder crossing the sky in one minute. I was talking to one of my neighbors and he pointed up to the north asking me what was that object in the sky.  Looking into the north sky I could see a silver object moving at a high rate of speed.   At first we thought it to be a airliner, but as it came closer, we could see it was a cylinder shape with no wings, no tail, no windows.  There was a faint pulsing bluish band around the center of it.   It was moving from north to south in a straight path at a high rate of speed.  It seemed to be about twice as fast as an airliner in the sky.  It crossed the sky in approximately one minute.    Object appeared to be at a lower altitude than an airliner, emitting no noise and no contrail.;26.0539;-97.3125
