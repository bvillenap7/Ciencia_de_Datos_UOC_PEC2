Triangular object might have been new Stealth technology.  But who's?;2007-06-30 23:00:00;5 to 10 seconds;Triangular object might have been new Stealth technology.  But who's? In 2007, I was in my backyard talking to my husband, it was late at night.  It’s been my habit to check out the sky, especially since my first sighting in the 60’s.  But this one was totally different from that sighting which occurred sometime between the years of 1967-1969.  I pulled up a chaise lounger and as I got comfortable, something caught my eye on my left side. Do you know how when you’re driving and it’s a very hot day?  Sometimes the road ahead of you in the distance appears as if waves are coming off the road.  The waves are kind of invisible but you can see them almost moving, shimmering.  It’s hard for me to explain. As I looked to my left, I saw a triangular shaped object, if you could call it that.   I say this because there wasn’t a solid object that you could see.  The only way that I know how to describe what I saw that night is to say it was a triangular shaped object and it appeared as if you could see right through it.  The entire triangular shape was moving across the night sky much like an airplane flies across the sky (but not that fast), and it wasn’t flying flat like you’d expect.  It was flying where I could see the entire triangle shape (facing me) so I guess you’d say it was on its side.  The pointed tip was pointed towards the southwest and that was the direction it was flying.  Its flight path would have been from the East to the Southwest.  Under other circumstances, you’d have to be directly under an object to see that it was a triangle shape, and if your level of sight was from the side, it might have appeared to be a flat object,  in other words, it would have lost ! its triangle shape to your view. This object appeared like those shimmering heat waves, so I was able to make out a distinct triangular shape against the clear night sky.  But, I could see stars within the waves.  I don’t know if it was a reflection or if I was seeing them through the object.  I’m surprised that I even saw it at all, but I did.  It was moving at a steady pace and it was in my vision for at least 5 to 10 seconds.  By the time I realized what I was seeing and told my husband to look, it was gone out of my sight and moving towards town where there were more lights and that would have made it almost impossible to see. I don’t know if these sightings are our own government, another countries government or from another planet.  I guess it could even be some rich guy conducting his own experiments.   Maybe one day we’ll all know the answer.  But, I hope it’s a stealth technology of our government because just the thought of it is a little scary and pretty cool indeed.
