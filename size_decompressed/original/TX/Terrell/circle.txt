UFO Outflys Gov Bomber in Terrell Texas;2001-10-20 15:00:00;3min;UFO Outflys Gov Bomber in Terrell Texas One afternoon I was driving east on i20 in Terrel Tx. I looked up in a clear sky and saw a Sac Bomber comming in for a landing in Fort Worth. The Bomber was Bigger than anything I have ever seen so I stopped my truck and Pulled out my JVC GR-AX70 camcorder and focused on the Jet Bomber. It looked small in the Viewfinder so I zoomed up to full zoom and as I was Taping it A Circular ball Passed in front of This Jet. Let me make somthing perfectly clear this jet is Big at least 2 football fields long wide etc. The Ball that passed in front of it was half is big as the jet so it can't be to small acording to distance because both objects are in clear focus. From the track of the UFO from intrance to exit of the seen the jet never passes or catches up with it this desplays an advanced flight capability we can't do at this time. I defy anyone to try to tell me this was a spec of Dust. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he seemed to us to be quite credible.  He has offered to send the video footage, and stills taken from it, although we have not received the photographic evidence yet.  PD));32.7495106382979;-96.2576787234043
