White oval object  moving with incredible speed to the west.;2008-10-09 13:00:00;10 seconds;White oval object  moving with incredible speed to the west. I observed an oval shaped object ,like a rugby shaped ball laying on its side ,it was white and it stayed motionless for about three to four seconds then moved with unbelievable speed but not violent,easy smooth speed as if it would be in one place then another moving in a straight line it was hard for me to keep my eyes moving with it as it was moving with good speed and disappeared from sight moving to the west.It went in a direction almost straight away from me but with a slight angle also an slight incline moving up at about a 20 degree ascent,the sighting lasted about ten seconds.I estimate it was at about 500 feet when I first saw it,the reason  I can give you that number is because it was above a partially wooded pasture,I estimated the trees height at about fifty feet.It was a clear sky and I detected no reflection on it by the sun.I was wearing a good  pair of shades that cut out 99% UV so I had an excellent view of it.There were no wings or tail and I could not make out any means of an propulsion system.;32.7495106382979;-96.2576787234043
