I looked up to see a red glowing orb, about the size of an airplane.  There was a green blinking light that looked to be on top of the craft.  The craft at one point swayed left to right several times in a way that I was sure this  was no plane.  It was traveling around three times the normal speed of a plane.  After passing us, the crafts lights turned to a white steady light as it moved out of site heading south toward Galveston, Texas.;29.4578;-95.0342

It looked somewhat like Venus when its at its brightest, but it was at 280 degrees west at about 15 degrees above the horizon.  There should be no planets in that direction. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that Venus would be on the ecliptic, in the western sky, and it would be quite visible, as the Sun continued to set in the west.  If the witness did not see two bright objects in the western sky, we assume that the one object he witnessed probably was Venus.  PD));29.4578;-95.0342
