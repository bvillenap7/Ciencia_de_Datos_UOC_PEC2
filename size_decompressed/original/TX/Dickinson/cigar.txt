two lights seen maybe cigar shaped craft moving inland over texas from the gulf of mexico;2005-08-06 05:49:00;4 min;two lights seen maybe cigar shaped craft moving inland over texas from the gulf of mexico i noted the time as soon as i saw it (long time coast to coast listener) it was heading southeast to northwest like it was coming from over the gulf of mexico towards inland there was some lightning out over the gulf in orange clouds the sky was flashing white from time to time, i was loading newspaper bundles into my truck and happened to look up and see two lights moving slowly towards me i at first thought maybe it was a plane sometimes when they are turning they seem as if their moving slow but this didn't change direction it kept moving southeast to northwest i then noticed the rear light seemed to be brighter than the front and this thing was moving way to slow to be conventional, unless it was a blimp, but there was no other lighting and it was 5:49 in the morning, it made no sound dickinson is so quite you can hear crickets in mid day, a couple of cars passed and i strained to hear something from the craft after each one,nothing, it was silent i held up my hand at arms length as it passed right in front of me i would say it was light to light one finger wide outside edge to outside edge of my bird finger,(it wasn't till i got home and wrote this down did i realize i was flipping them off, lol) the lights looked like two stars i think it may have been cigar shaped i couldn't make out the details cause the lighting i was in, as it started to get out of sight the rear light seemed to twinkle red but it could have been the distance or something but as it flew away a plane passed right behind it's path flying northeast to southwest and i thought i'm sure they had to see it, that craft(the plane) seemed to be flying like a plane and it had several white and red flashing lights on it,i'm sure they saw it,as it got completly out of sight i noted the time again it was 5:53 four minutes had passed wow what a rush i remembered what ya'll said to write down every detail as not to cloud a memory so i did right away. i do live just south of nasa just a few miles,at the time it wasn't heading towards nasa but west of there so i don't know for sure what this thing was but it did not move conventional i give you my word on that.thanks, brett;29.4578;-95.0342
