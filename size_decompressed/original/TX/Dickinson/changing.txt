single point lite source changing occasionally to bipolar red/azure elongated object rapidly jerking around nite sky;2001-11-18 05:00:00;50 minutes;single point lite source changing occasionally to bipolar red/azure elongated object rapidly jerking around nite sky While observing the leonid shower we saw what initially appeared to be another satillite travelling south to north stop and reverse direction at the same speed, initially a bright point of light at the same magnitude of a typical star or a little brighter. It then made an abrubt right angle turn to the east, followed by a full clockwise 360 that was approx. one half of your fist size held at arms length. For the next 50 minutes or so we watched this object make similar manouvers along with completely stopping, accelerating instantaniously to approx. 4-5 times the typical satillite speed, sometimes in stacatto bursts. All wittnessed flight occured apprx. 45 to 70 degress above the horizon, and covered approx. 30 degrees of the compass. Twice another ver small lite sourch dropped out of the object at a 30 degree angle to the rear and once the same size lite re-enentered the main oject from the same course in reverse. Several times during different manouvers the main object appeared to be elongated with an azure light on one end an a red light on the other.As dawn apprached it was only outlasted by saturn, jupitor, and 3 large stars.This was witnessed by three professional adults and two intelligent 17 year olds. All movements almost appeared to be entirely random and very abrupt.;29.4578;-95.0342
Erratic point of light observed over the Galveston Bay area, TX.;2001-11-18 05:30:00;30;Erratic point of light observed over the Galveston Bay area, TX. At 5 AM four friends and I were watching the Leonid meteor shower from the roof top of a home along Dickinson bay, TX.  Enjoy the show, we also observed a few satilites.  We then saw a point of light that we at first believed to be a satelite.  However, it was traveling roughly SE to NW, a direction I haven't seen before.  The point of light was typical of a satelite:  about the size & brightness of an average star, and moving in a straight line at a typical speed for a satelite.  Within 2, however, the light momentarily came to a complete stop, and reversed direction.  It then stopped again and began a series of rough circles, stoping for a few minutes after each completed circle.  My friends reported smaller points of light leaving and returning to the object at one point in time (I was watching an appoaching plane, which I thought might have been a reconisance flight from the near-by air force base).  After about a half dozen of these circular trajectories, the object remained motionless, and faded-out with the light of dawn.  We watched this object for about 30.  The sky was clear.  Its cirlcles were limited to probably no more than 5 degrees of distance.  We feel that a plane, helicopter, and weather balloon can be ruled out.;29.4578;-95.0342
Huge rust-colored amoeba, rolling through sky for 4 min above Dickinson, TX.;2014-05-25 19:00:00;4 minutes;Huge rust-colored amoeba, rolling through sky for 4 min above Dickinson, TX. I observed with binoculars, a rust-colored object in the space above a twin-prop airplane.  The plane gave me reference to size and speed:  much slower than the plane and about the same size, when in its rolled-up position. The shape morphed from that of a rolled-up newspaper to that of a polyhedron.   However,the edges were not straight angles, but were concave, like a star. The UFO continued on a straight course and morphed every 5-10 seconds.  Its course was ESE to WNW.;29.4578;-95.0342
Very bright  colors.;2016-01-30 18:20:00;6 minutes;Very bright  colors We were getting ready to head out and my vehicle was facing east towards Galveston, and we notice this bright light changing color from red purple very bright It did stayed up there for like 5 minutes then start It going down slowly and disappear , we never seem anything that brite , I know it wasn't a Helicopter or an air plane ..;29.4578;-95.0342
