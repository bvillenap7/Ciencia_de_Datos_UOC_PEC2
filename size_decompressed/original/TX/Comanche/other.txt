After an evening spring Texas turkey hunt, I drove my 4wd ford bronco across the ranch to return to my motor home. (Camp)  along the way, I was to pick up my dad and when I approached him, he was obviously watching something above me.  He said nothing only looked.  I asked what are you looking at and he replied I donâ€™t know.  Turning around I saw about 200 feet above me a motionless black object.  It made no sound.  It was a cube shape, approximately 25 feet on each side and it had no surface texture at all.  Its surface appeared to be a void collapsing into itself.  It seemed as if it were an abyss and drawing light into it.  I looked at it for about 5 seconds and it suddenly ascended at a rate that I would estimate being greater than 50,000 feet per minute.  (I am a licensed pilot) as it ascended, it made no sound but a bright white/blue/red/yellow light appeared on its underside.  In less than 4 seconds, this object climbed and disappeared vertically right into infinity.  We asked each other what the hell was that.  Dad mentioned that he thought it might have been what people call a UFO.  Three months later, I underwent emergency brain surgery for a cerebral fistula (blood vessel malformation that the doctors referred to as extremely life threatening.  I have no idea if these circumstances are related but the thought that this encounter may have been related is quite chilling.;31.9128;-98.615
