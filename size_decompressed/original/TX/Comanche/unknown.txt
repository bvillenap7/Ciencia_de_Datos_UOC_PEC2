Driving on hwy 590 towards comanche about 5 miles outside of town at approximately 11pm there was a bright emerald green light that came streaking from right to left across the windshield at about 20 degrees to vertical at a good distance from the road (maybe 200 or 300 yards).  The light appeared with a flash and took less than a second to cross the sky.  The light was radiating heavily and looked to have extuinguished before coming in contact with the ground.  The size of the object is uncertain because of the distance and the rate of speed.  It looked to be quite large, and I would speculate that it exceeded the size of a full size truck.;31.9128;-98.615
Stationary craft with normal aircraft lighting, to far in the distance to make out a shape!;2012-11-03 21:00:00;2-3 hours;stationary craft with normal aircraft lighting, to far in the distance to make out a shape! UFO SIGHTING I was star gazing when I noticed a light in the sky west of DFW airport, this light was making some amazing turns, with no typical aircraft lighting seen, I watched this light for 15 minutes, then decided that it wasnâ€™t an aircraft, I pointed a green laser at the object and it shot up out of the atmosphere and out of sight. Since that night I have notice two separate objects (as I live in the Comanche Texas area) , stationary on the sky in the direction of DFW, and one in the direction of Waco Texas.  These objects are stationary and have normal aircraft lighting of Red, Green and white lights!  Not sure as to what this could be, but as a pilot, I believe these are not normal aircraft!;31.9128;-98.615
