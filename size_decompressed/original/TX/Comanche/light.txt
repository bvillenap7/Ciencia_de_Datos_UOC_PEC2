Flickering stationary orangish/yellowish light seen multiple times and places near Comanche, Texas.;2002-11-13 20:45:00;3 seconds 3 different tim;Flickering stationary orangish/yellowish light seen multiple times and places near Comanche, Texas. My girlfriend and I were leaving my church in Hasse, about seven miles away from the town of Comanche.  She saw an orangish yellowish light in the sky to the west of us.  She said that it got brighter on and off and then dimmed out after a few seconds.  I wasn't sure if she was mistaken or not until she saw it when we were at a traffic light in Comanche and pointed it out to me.  It got bright then dimmed out again.  As we headed toward the west side of town, we saw it again in a different part of the sky, so I'm not sure whether there was just one or if there were more than one. The second time that I saw it, I think I observed a small dark speck in the middle.  It was definitely hundreds if not thousands of feet up, and we are absolutely certain that it wasn't a plane nor any sort of flare. It remained stationary during each of the sightings.;31.9128;-98.615
