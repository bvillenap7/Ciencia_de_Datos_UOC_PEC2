Witnessed UFO stationairy, begin to slowly move, went near vertical and literally climbed out of the atmosphere at incredable speed!;2008-07-10 23:00:00;25-30 seconds;Witnessed UFO stationairy, begin to slowly move, went near vertical and literally climbed out of the atmosphere at incredable speed! I had stepped outside onto my back 2nd story porch for a cigarette and stood and admired the sky and stars as I do everynight. A particularly bright object that appeared to be a star or planet caught my attention and I proceeded to stare at it. The object was stationairy and appeared no different looking than a bright star so I quickly dimissed it. The object was stationairy from the time I came out onto the porch and first noticed it (10-15 seconds). The object was directly East of my location and situated high in the sky, about 25-30 degrees off of being directly vertical over me and at a 70-75 degree angle in the sky off the horizon. I was about to look away and stare at another patch of sky when I noticed that the object started moving to the North. It moved slowly and at a constant speed in a straight line at a constant altitude, which made me think that maybe it was an airplane coming to or from DFW airport which is very close. But the object appeared to be at very high altitude, higher than I've ever seen a plane fly, and as I scrutinized it I could not see any blinking lights that distinguish aircraft and are usually visible at any altitude. The object was a solid and constant sphere shaped light that again looked similar to a bright star. It quickly became obvious it was NOT an airplane but I still didn't think UFO. So then I start thinking I'm seeing a satellite or something go overhead in orbit. I continue observing the object move East to North across the sky expecting to watch it (thinking its a satellite) arch across the sky. But after 8-10 seconds of slow moving predictable flight the object began to move erraticly and looked to be gaining altitude because the object was getting dimmer and dimmer the higher and further away it got from me. The object also began to accellerate, slowly at first while it zigzagged but then it really started picking up speed! I mean at the high altitude the object was at, for it to move that fast across the sky it must've been doing incredible speed. I have never seen something accellerate so fast! As the object accellerated it climbed near vertical and, well, ascended into space is the best way I could describe it. It did NOT continue travelling across the sky, it accellerated to unbelievable speed and went near vertical and appeared to rapidly climb out of the atmosphere. IT DID NOT just disappear behind some trees or over the horizon, it went near straight UP and disappeared overhead as it accellerated away! When I saw the object start to move like gravity didn't effect it, and move as unbeilveably fast as it did, an icy ball materialized in my stomach, and I felt genuine fear rush over ! me like a wave, when it became obvious that this could not possibly be a plane or satellite. I saw it, it's real! Total event time 25-30 seconds from the time I came onto the porch and witnessed the object stationairy (10-15 secs) start to move slowly (8-10 secs) and then zigzag, climb, and accelerate upward near vertical until out of sight overhead (3-5 secs).  NOTE: I live within 10 miles of DFW airport and I see dozens of planes fly overhead everyday. I was born and raised here 24 years and have always seen and been used to aircraft going overhead every couple minutes 24/7, 365. The only day in my entire life that I have not seen an airplane in the sky is 9/11/2001.  My father is a 30 year veteran 777 captain for American Airlines, so I've been raised on planes, and can identify almost any aircraft (military or civilian) if shown a picture of it. I am personally a Baylor University Student studying International Relations.;32.9457000000001;-97.1546999999999
UFO over North Texas 6/24/09,  Star like object, video captured;2009-06-24 01:10:00;1 hour +;UFO over North Texas 6/24/09,  Star like object, video captured. I was about to hit the sack and happened to look out my bathroom window and saw a very bright star in the sky. It was too bright. I went out my front door which faces south and looked west. The object was very bright and located southwest of me in the sky.  I ran inside and grabbed my Sony hi-def camera (HDR-SR11) and was able to take about 11 minutes worth of footage.  I was able to get about 6 minutes of a steady camera shot with a tree in the background. Iâ€™ve seen these objects here in Texas for over 10 years.  Whatever they are they are definitely trying to act like a floating star or planet. I believe they are everywhere, but are easier to spot when you have a big sky to view them.  I posted a 6 minute clip here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psBC8l2GcNM   The video rendering on youtube took away the ability to see the tree on the right hand side. The object did not appear again on 6/25 at 1:00, so it was not a star or planet.;32.9457000000001;-97.1546999999999
A small white light flew from left to right for about one second then flashed and disappeared.;2019-07-30 00:01:00;1 second;A small white light flew from left to right for about one second then flashed and disappeared. A bright, small, white light entered the atmosphere and flew left to right for about one second. It looked almost like a comet (shooting star) except that is not possible, as there is extreme light pollution and only about three stars are visible even on a clear day.  It was also too close to the ground.  After flying, it flashed and disappeared.  Three people witnessed the event.;32.9457000000001;-97.1546999999999
