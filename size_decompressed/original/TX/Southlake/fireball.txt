My husband, daughter and I were driving west on FM 1709 towards Keller, TX when we saw a fireball with a tail moving very fast in the northwest sky. At first we thought it was a meteor, but it appeared to explode, but instead of disintegrating, it split into 3 bright lights and they began circling each other. The lights seem to be suspended in mid air as they hovered around each other and moved up and down. One at a time they would disappear and reappear. At one point we think there were 5 lights. This continued for 4-5 minutes then we saw what looked like helicopters surrounding the lights. It seemed they were moving further from us and eventually they all disappeared.  We talked about it, but decided it was probably pilots from Carswell or pilots practicing for the air show scheduled at Alliance Airport that weekend. However, with all the news recently about odd sightings we decided we should report it.;32.9457000000001;-97.1546999999999
A small, white light flew left to right for about one second at a high rate of speed.;2019-07-30 00:01:00;1 second;A small, white light flew left to right for about one second at a high rate of speed. A small, white light entered the atmosphere and flew from left to right for approximately 1 second.  It looked almost like a comet (shooting star) except that is not possible, as there is extreme light pollution and only one star is visible in it.  It was also too close to the ground to be a commit.  3 people observed the object.;32.9457000000001;-97.1546999999999
