I was sitting in a jacuzzi with a friend around 11:15 PM (no phone or clock) when I looked up and saw a crescent shaped, white light.  It was gliding NE or East relatively slowly through the sky.  When I pointed to it and started freaking out, my friend slowly turned around (his back was facing toward it and he was sitting) and by that point it was behind the trees. Didn't change direction or stop. Movement was slow and steady  Didn't see where it came from Disappeared behind some trees  No fog in sky  Sober;32.9457000000001;-97.1546999999999
