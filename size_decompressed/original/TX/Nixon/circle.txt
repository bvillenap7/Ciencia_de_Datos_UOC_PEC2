Flashing object in Nixon, TX.;2014-01-19 04:47:00;27 minutes;Flashing object in Nixon, TX. On January 19, 2014, I awoke for some odd reason with a desire to go outside.  It was 4:47AM and I went outside to our picnic table and was looking around the sky and noticed this light in the western sky. I knew it was not a star or planet, as I'm a amateur astronomer.  I watched the light which was white in color and then noticed it slowly disappeared, it then came back for about 15-20 seconds and disappeared.  At that point I ran back into my home and got my video camera and tripod. I videotaped the object and for about 27 minutes.  During this time the object I believe may have landed, but I'm not sure.  I do know that there was something on the ground that was flashing in a consistent manner, it was something that was not there when I first started looking at the sky as there was nothing flashing before I noticed the light in the sky. I have never experienced anything like this before, but I do go out there nightly because this area off highway 87 has strange things in the sky so I make it a point to try and find something. One important thing of note is that I copied this video to post on YouTube.com, but what's strange is that the audio is choppy.  I've never had a problem with this camera, but if you watch the video at the end you can see a daylight shot which I took at 7AM in which my dog is in it and you can hear me speak normally.  I think that the object I was video taping was actually interfering with the camera.  Here is the YouTube link:  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XVmSmEzi8RI;29.3021;-97.7491
