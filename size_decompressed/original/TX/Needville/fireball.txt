November 21 - We were outside at BBQ about 8:30 at night and noticed a red ball of light slowly moving south to north across sky.  It was not very high, made no sound, and had no tail.  It almost appeared to be in flames and pulsing.  It began to climb higher and higher until it finally disappeared. About 10 seconds later the exact same thing came across the sky traveling the same path and disappeared.  Three families were outside and witnessed this with us. December 1 -  We saw the same thing as on November 21 on December 1. Exact same time in evening and same two type of objects with 10 second delay between the objects appearing. We were able to capture it this time on camcorder - when we zoomed in on object it looks like red pulsing orb.;29.4102;-95.8316
