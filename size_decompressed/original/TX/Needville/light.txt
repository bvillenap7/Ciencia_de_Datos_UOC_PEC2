Two big bright lights followed by several smaller lights  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect celestial bodies.  PD));2004-10-14 02:30:00;several hours;Two big bright lights followed by several smaller lights We saw one giant bright light, and that is what atracted out attention. Then we noticed several yellow lights, and a few blue lights, and a red one which was also very bright. We watched from 2am until 5:30am. We saw many different things. The very bright blue one  (the first one) we saw had something that looked like a beam from it, and the only other one that did was the red one. The red one was the closest and the last one we saw. They all moved in eradic motions. Up and down, and then left and right, and then they would go in circles, and also do zigzag and diaganol movements. Many were in a triangler formation, and then some were in lines. At least one of the triangles were connected to another, and there very well may have been other patterns but we were caught up in the excitement. An intresting note is 2 of the other witnessess were not in the same location as the other 3. We called them to see if they saw the same things we did. We also saw a LOT of shooting objects which only appeared for a second as they moved.;29.4102;-95.8316
