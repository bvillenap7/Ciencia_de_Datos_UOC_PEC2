((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Mars.  PD))  I was outside last night packing our truck at our ranch in Texasâ€¦;2005-10-16 08:45:00;15 minutes;I was outside last night packing our truck at our ranch in Texas to come back home to Louisiana and noticed a very bright, large star-shaped light in the southwestern sky.  It was moving in that direction as well.  It appeared to change shapes when you looked at it.  Sometimes it was a bright light with a little splash of red in the center and other times it appeared to make a star-burst pattern.  I called my husband outside to look and he watched for a couple of minutes and went back inside.  The object was just above the tree line (very large oaks in our region) and moved extremely slow.  I must have watched it for at least 15 minutes.  I am not sure what I saw (it could have been the space station), but, it was very interesting to watch as well as spooky.   Whatever it was, was very large in size...located approximately 3-4 miles away from where our ranch is located.  I don't ever remember seeing such a bright star in that direction at the ranch.  The ranch is located in a remote area with no lights to interfere with the sky.  The moon was very bright as well last night.  I am a ((deleted)) designer with a B.S. degree and my husband has his Ph.D. from ((school in the southwest)). ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Mars.  PD));30.9282;-96.094
