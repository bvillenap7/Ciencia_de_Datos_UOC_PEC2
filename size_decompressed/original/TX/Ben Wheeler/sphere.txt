((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he provided additional information, which we summarize below:  Witness was looking at the Moon, when he saw a very bright object over his left shoulder.   The object was quickly almost directly overhead, and approximately three times the size of a full Moon.   The object coursed to the east, and suddenly just winked out.  It was like someone turning off a light switch.   As the witnessed the object from below, he saw a distinct orange color, and not the green color that other witnessed reported seeing from other parts of Texas.  The witness is a medical professional, and we suspect that he is a very capable observer.   PD));32.4106;-95.6335
