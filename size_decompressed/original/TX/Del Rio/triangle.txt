V-shaped object in Del Rio Texas;1986-08-16 21:00:00;20 seconds;V-shaped object in Del Rio Texas A friend and I were sitting on our bikes at approx.  9pm. I was facing north and he was facing south.  We were located between 11th and 12th street. I lived on 17th but on the same ave “B” as my friend. All of a sudden we heard a really, really faint breeze sound. I don’t know how we both heard it since it was so faint.    We both looked up and saw a traingle shape object moving northwest. It wasn’t very high in the air. I would say maybe a 1-1/2 neighborhood block up in the air. I couldn’t begin to tell you how big it was. It was made up of small faint lights. I don’t remember seeing the third part of the triangle. Just the “V” shape. It was made up of maybe 7 or 8 lights on each side.  We pretty much ran inside and told his parents what we saw and then came out later and did not see it again.  About 7 years later I was living in dallas and saw a show that Larry king was doing in area 52 with a bunch of UFO experts. He was broadcasting from the desert. I was really freaked out to see that one of the sightings that they were showing was an exact description of what I saw. Only in a different state. I remember what it looked like that night in del Rio, like it was yesterday. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD));29.4073832061071;-100.893056870228
