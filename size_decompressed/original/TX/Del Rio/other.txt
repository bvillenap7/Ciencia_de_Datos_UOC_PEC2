At first, I thought it was one of the many airplanes they have here at the airforce base but this particular flashing light was unusual, because it appeared to be flashing up and down. I lost sight of the flashing light so i decided to go and get my siter, on our way back we were passing right by the Sheriff'office, when we noticed a flashing light that was not very high, we thought it was a helicoper but there was no sound, then suddenly the whole light changed to red and it was flashing quite fast, it moved towards the city and we lost it.;29.4073832061071;-100.893056870228
Sighting of prism like craft on the devils river in west Texas;2006-05-16 23:00:00;15 min.;Sighting of prism like craft on the devils river in west Texas Four of us witnessed a craft that lookes like a spining prism at a distance of about 800 yards.We were working on a ranch that was on the devils river outside of del rio, Texas. The first night the object was seen only two people witnessed this craft.The object was so close it awoke on of the witnesses with the lights coming in the back window of a motor home. The lights were changing colors like a prism blue , yellow , purple, etc... We were at the very end of the road , THERE IS NO POSSIBLE VEHICLE THAT COULD ACCESS THIS AREA. The following night I was able to get binoculars on the object, when i did the hair on the back of my head stood up. I have family that are pilots and i have been around aircraft my entire life, THIS WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT.When i handed the binoculars to another person i walked over to my truck and grabbed my riffle , not with any intendtion of using it but this object shook me up and i guess i needed a little sucurity. The project manager was trying to get a telescope focused on the object during this time and as we were speaking about how strange it was and right before we could get the telescope on it , it took off like an inverted shooting star. Nothing man made travels that fast from 800 yards to completely out of site in seconds. I have been puzzled over the entire event , and none of us talk about it very much. It would be intresting to find out about simular reports or explainations.These witnesses are Home builders, excavation contractors and septic installers not scientist of star gazeriers. This was a real sighting.;29.4073832061071;-100.893056870228
