bright light dead stop then moved and disappeard at warp speed;2003-07-13 05:00:00;15-30 seconds;bright light dead stop then moved and disappeard at warp speed This informatation was reported to me by coincidence. I went to the used book store to see if they had set aside any books of UFOs or Abductions for me. They told me of a person having been in the day before talking about having seen a UFO. I asked them to have him contact me if they remembered who it was. I was contacted and this is the info I was given. I have asked if I could interview this person, but consent has not been given as of yet. I do have permission to report it in case anyone else saw something on this date or near here. I was sitting outside for an early morning smoke. Saw a bright light dead stop to warp speed started off in the north in a straight line then went to 35-30% stopped. Did this 4 or 5 times then took off to the East a warp speed. No configuration dissernable, just a light.;29.4073832061071;-100.893056870228
Bright light in the night sky, changes colors from red/green/yellow.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a star, or Venus??  PD));2010-12-02 21:30:00;30 min.;Bright light in the night sky, changes colors from red/green/yellow. On November 7, 2010 at 4:40 a.m. I was awaken by dogs barking.  It’s been getting pretty cold, so our dogs have been sleeping in our porch or in the house.  I looked out our living room window, which is located at the front of our house facing southeast.  I immediately noticed a very bright and colorful light in the sky.  This colorful light changed colors from red, green and yellow.  It was a clear night and was very visible.  I grabbed a sweater and went outside to get a better look.  This was pretty exciting for me and I wanted to share this with my two daughters(20 & 18 yrs. old).  Both were fast asleep and didn’t wake up.  Still wanting to share this with someone, I began text messaging with my 22 yr. old son.  He works nights and of course was awake and suggested that I video record this sighting.  I recorded it on my blackberry and took a few shots of it.  As I began to process my experience, I actually started googling recent UFO sightings and even ! went on a star magazine website.  On this magazine’s website I found that a star named “Mira” was visible to the unaided eye as a red star.  So I figured this bright and colorful light was this star “Mira”. As the days passed, I curiously began paying more attention to the stars at night.  I’ve since seen this bright colorful light in the sky at least 6 times and so has my husband and 18 yr. old.  Last night(12/1/2010) we brought our dogs inside because of the cold temps.  We were all sleeping, when one of the dogs began barking and running down the hallway towards the front door.  I am a light sleeper and got up quickly to see what was going on.  This was at about 1:40 a.m.  By this time our other dog got up and followed me outside.  My small dog that woke me up, kept barking up towards the sky.  Sure enough the bright colorful light was there again.  I woke up my husband and we both went back outside to see the lights.  We watched for a few minutes, until we couldn’t stand the cold temp.  I am convinced this is not a star. 	Just this evening my husband and I both saw it in the northwestern sky at about 9:30 p.m. and then again in the southeastern sky at about 10:00 p.m.  I’m not an expert, but if I’m not mistaken stars don’t switch locations like that.  Our town has a small airport and an air force base.  But this looks nothing like airplane lights to me.  The couple of times that I’ve seen it, the colors are clearly red/green/yellow and it‘s stationary.  It doesn’t twinkle like a star, but blinks as it changes colors.;29.4073832061071;-100.893056870228
One white light with few red lights moving very slowly then disappearing fast in the sky;2011-08-10 22:30:00;about 8 seconds;One white light with few red lights moving very slowly then disappearing fast in the sky I was jogging around my neighborhood around 10:30 PM when from the corner of my eye I saw a white light moving very slowly.  I turned my head to look up at the light and saw that there were an equal amount of red lights on each side, but I can’t remember exactly how many there were.   When I had turned my head to look, the lights stopped moving and the white lights shined in my direction.   The only way I can think to explain the white light is that it turned to me as if someone was looking at me.  After it shined at me, the lights went up into the air and disappeared.   This all happened in like 8 seconds.;29.4073832061071;-100.893056870228
