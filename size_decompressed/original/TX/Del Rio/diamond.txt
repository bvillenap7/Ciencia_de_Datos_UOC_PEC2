Sighting in Del Rio, Texas;1985-07-24 21:00:00;2 minutes;Sighting in Del Rio, Texas The years was 1985. My friend and I were 15 years old. My friend and I were sitting on our bikes one night. We were sitting on them in the middle of the street in Del Rio, Texas. The streets were 11th and Ave B. We were talking and for some reason we both looked up. I guess we had both heard a subtle air or whisper sound. I couldn’t really tell you that we heard much of anything. I just know that some kind of noise or feeling made us both look up right at it at the same time. It’s not like we ever sat out there looking at stars. We were facing North east and the craft was heading north west. It was a diamond shape made up of faint lights. There were no lights visible inside the diamond. It looked as if it was going maybe 70 to 80 MPH and was about a mile above us. Maybe as big as a football field. It was as if it was disguised within the starts of the night. But we could see the diamond. There is an airforce base in Del Rio and I am familiar with just about every kind of craft that flies out of that base. My Dad worked there for 30 years and I grew up there. This was big, cloaked and whisper quiet. We ran inside screaming, told my friends mom and that was all we saw. Never saw it again.;29.4073832061071;-100.893056870228
