At 6:40 pm two adults and one child were on a farm in Cumby Texas talking and looking up at the stars as it was a beautiful night.  After fishing all day we were packing our gear in the car when we noticed a very very bright star. At first we thought it was a satellite but the light was constant and as it came over head we noticed that it was moving in a snake like s-pattern as it made its way across the sky.  As it reached about 2-o'clock it faded away quicky as if some one just turned it off.  It was a very bright round white light that was constant.  There were no other lights.  There was no sound. The snaking motion or wobble, was very distinctive and could not have been a plane as there were no other lights or sound.  I have seen a lot of planes and I cannot think of anything that could fly like that without crashing.;33.1092;-95.7909
