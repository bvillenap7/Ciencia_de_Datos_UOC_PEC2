We were on our way back from San Antonio towards Houston on I-10. My friend really needed to go to the restroom, but there was no place near in sight, so we just exited in the nearest exit so he can just go in the bushes or whatever. It was completely dark, no clouds in the sky, only the moon and stars, and only the head lights on the car let us see, so we stoped at this stop sign, then the sky, it completely lights up in a bluish dimish light, but it was bright, very hard to explain, it caught our attention, I looked up at the sky to see if it was the moon that might have bursted into light or something, but it wasnt, so i thought maybe a plane really low? but i was wrong planes keep moving have a sound and have distictive light points. but instead there was this orb of somekind, you can look at it, it didnt make your eyes squint, so the light was powerful enough to light up the sky, and we can even see the clearing and trees infront of us, but you can see it without it bothering your eyes. it was about 250-300 ft above the sky, it was there for about one or two seconds, they it started dimming in a really weird way, and moved east reallly fast dimming while it did, and dissapeared almost instantly. we all just sit still in the car, till my friend acknowlged it. i was in awe, we were shocked. it was the strangest thing i had ever seen, it couldn't have been a flare because this moved to the east and dissapeared and was extremely fast. almost like we scared it off or something. it made no noise, and left no trail of any sort. I'm pretty sure maybe someone else driving on the highway might have seen it. But i know me and 2 of my friends in the car saw it.;29.6837;-97.6464
