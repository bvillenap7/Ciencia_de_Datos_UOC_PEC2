Two triangle objects with blinking white and one red light. Flying at very low altitudes over suburbs silently.;2011-07-22 03:00:00;2min;Two triangle objects with blinking white and one red light. Flying at very low altitudes over suburbs silently. We were walking through a very suburban area of town when we noticed an aircraft coming towards our direction. We hid and watched, waiting for it to pass.   At first we thought it was a helicopter due to its slow movement, but it was nearly silent.  We thought it was looking for us because of how slowly it moved forward, and how low it was to the ground. It was in a dark triangle shape, with white lights at the ends, and a red light in the center.  I believe it had a metallic pattern on the underbelly.  The white and red lights blinked intermittently.  It took around two minutes for it to pass us and go behind the trees and when it did, we got to a higher elevation and could still see it (very low to the ground). It didn't move in an exact straight line, it slowly and steadily turned and turned back to keep forward.  About 25 minutes later, another similar aircraft passed by in the same direction, slightly faster I think and this time it was silent.  My friend claims to have seen the red light glow very bright and large but I did not see this myself, he had chased after it. Something that might be worth noting: we had seen up to 3 shooting stars the same night, although a couple hours before and after we saw the aircrafts. Not sure about correlation. Not sure what it was! Definitely was not your average airplane, that's all I know. I was too bewildered to get a good photograph with my cellphone, however my friend may have.

Whitish Gray triangular object without lights flew silently above Highway 5 from North to South. The object was as big as a house.;2014-10-31 20:15:00;<15 seconds;Whitish Gray triangular object without lights flew silently above Highway 5 from North to South. The object was as big as a house. On October 31, 2014 at about 8:15 p.m. in Allen, Texas, I saw a triangular shaped object in the air about 400 to 500 feet above Highway 5, near Stacy Road.  The object was traveling from the North going South.  It was as wide as a house.  It did not have any lights on it. I know it was not a flock of birds because it was a solid object and the underside showed a whitish gray color throughout the triangular formâ€¦not just the V that you normally see with a flock of birds.  There was no wings flapping like you would see with birds.  The object seemed to glide easily through the air at a consistent speed and was traveling quite fast. Additionally, the object made no noise. It was completely silent.;33.0985956896552;-96.6532439655181
Drone or UFO.;2014-11-11 20:20:00;10 minutes;Drone or UFO. Observed low flying craft with no or dim lights - at first glance looked like a hangglider - in shape and distance from ground.  Made no noise, moved slowly,  Hard to spot against night sky.  Dark gray.  Was pointed south, went inside, came back and located it still headed south, but in a different position.  Unsure if this was second object or same object had moved.  Came back out approx. 3 minutes later and could not locate a 3rd time.
