a boomerang in the sky, what was  it?;2008-10-23 19:00:00;45 minutes;a boomerang in the sky, what was  it? I have pics and a video (but the video is not any good, so my husband says.) We, in Allen TX witnessed a large object in the sky it was shaped as a golden boomerang, it was very bright in color and simply stood still for about 45 minutes and just pulsated. It was about 7:30 pm and I happened to have gone outside for a smoke, when I saw the light, it looked odd.  Overly bright. I was also on the phone with a friend, trying to explain what I was seeing, and she told me to go get my camera, which I did and took a great pic of this object in the sky!  I also used my cell to call my neighbor who is very much into astronomy to see if it was perhaps just a planet, when I showed him the object in the sky, he said NO that was not a star or planet. The excitement was confirmed the next morning on the radio, when they talked about the Stephenville lights, seen roughly an hour later. Can you imagine what I thought? I captured an image just like they did in Stephenville. I was interviewed on the radio, and sent my pictures to the station. KEEP your eyes on the sky, there is something out there. what was it? I don't know, but I have a great picture of it.;33.0985956896552;-96.6532439655181
BLACK CUBE UFO.;2012-08-01 02:30:00;45 seconds;BLACK CUBE UFO. It was a rainy night that night.  I work in a data center so I get off late at night.  Around 2:30am, I am standing outside smoking a cigarette.  The rain had subsided, but there were still strong winds being blown around in all directions.  I was speaking to a buddy on the phone looking out into the night sky.  The clouds were hanging low and the street lights were giving the clouds an eerie orange glow.  It also lit up the sky.  I caught something out of the corner of my eye moving from the North.  I am facing due West at this point.  It was just under the clouds and moving at a good pace, about 100mph if I were to guess.  It was traveling South just above 75 Central Expressway.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen, or may ever see in my life.  It was a black cube 80-100ft tall.  I was awe-struck.  I really sat and took in the moment even with my friend on the phone.  I knew this was special.  It didn't make a single noise and was about 500ft off the ground.  It literally looked like it was carved out of a rough black stone.  There were no lights to speak of.  There were no pipes or anything industrial on the outside of the craft. When the craft was directly in front of me I could clearly see the details.  The side facing me was framed on the edge.  I mean that it had a line carved into the stone that ran the entire edge of the side.  Within the framed edge was a circular pattern.  It was obvious to me that it was a deliberate pattern.  I can only say that it would take an understanding of mathematics to create the circle.  As it went from my right to left, North to South, it left a vapor trail that swirled in the disturbed air behind it.  Like I said, it made no sound.  It was absolutely huge.  The rain started to come down again as it left my sight.  I immediately told my friend to go outside as he was South of my location.  He waited out in the middle of his street for 20 minutes looking for it. He was never able t! o see it as conditions worsened with the rain.  I cannot stop ! thinking about this incident now.  I cannot stop looking for this craft.  It is monumental in terms of what kind of an impact this has had on my life.  This changes everything.;33.0985956896552;-96.6532439655181
Red spherical/triangular object active in Allen, TX approximatley five minutes, five witnesses.;2019-01-18 21:50:00;5 minutes;Red spherical/triangular object active in Allen, TX approximatley five minutes, five witnesses. The object was first seen by two people as a large object in the sky, it was triangular in shape but ovular in the edges.  There was a central light shining brightly with the shape being outlined by smaller, dimmer lights on the outside of it.  It zig-zagged across the sky in fluid and precise motions moving back behind houses and extremely close to the total five people around.  It did this while also changing color (first red, then blue, then purple, then back to red) back and forth for approximately five minutes before vanishing into thin air.  At his time we were facing Lewisvill where three months ago an eerily similar scene took place.;33.0985956896552;-96.6532439655181
