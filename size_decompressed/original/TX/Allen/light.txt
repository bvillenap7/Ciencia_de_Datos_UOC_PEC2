Very Bright blinking light in sky, brightest light I have ever seen.;2010-05-05 06:00:00;12 min;Very Bright blinking light in sky, brightest light I have ever seen. Noticed very bright white  blinking light in SE sky.  Could tell it was not a plane as the planes were coming in from the NE with their landing lights on.  This light was about 30 degrees above the horizon and the sun was just beginning to rise on the horizon.  The light would blink, then go to solid, then back to blinking, then to solid and then almost strobe like it was blinking so fast.  This went on for a good twelve minutes brfore the light quit and the object shot across the sky to the NW.  It was so fast it seemed a blur.;33.0985956896552;-96.6532439655181
Burst of bright flashing of lights that lit up the sky.;2014-08-09 04:00:00;45 minutes;Burst of bright flashing of lights that lit up the sky At around 4am, humming and vibration were felt, followed by 3 burst of bright blue and greenish lights in the sky.   The lights were electrifying and made a crackling sound.  The lights literally lit up the sky in a about a second duration.  There were a few minutes of pause between each bursts. There was a final burst of yellow lights in the sky at 4:45 am, which cause my phone to ring for a split second then dead silence and nothing else happened.;33.0985956896552;-96.6532439655181
