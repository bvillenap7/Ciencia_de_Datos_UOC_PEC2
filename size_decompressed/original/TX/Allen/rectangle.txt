Red and Blue lights in sky at Allen, Texas.;2014-08-06 22:30:00;3 minutes;Red and Blue lights in sky at Allen, Texas Approximately 10:15 to 10:30 pm, my wife and I were in our front yard, when we saw this odd shaped craft going south to north.  Looked to be about the height that a helicopter would fly.   At first it was going at the speed of a helicopter and then it just took off.   It came back and circled around an area to our north west and then just hovered over an area appearing not to move and then moving slightly to the left and right then it just disappeared.   This object made no sound and had red and blue lights, shaped similar to a rectangle. My wife tried to get a picture on the cell phone but it only showed a bright light.   Will be watching tonight at 10:30 with my camera and binoculars.;33.0985956896552;-96.6532439655181
