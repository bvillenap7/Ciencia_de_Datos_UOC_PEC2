Amorphous and slighly oval shaped, black object seen in broad daylight...;2020-12-12 14:10:00;5 minutes;Amorphous and slighly oval shaped, black object seen in broad daylight... At approximately 14:!0 CST I was leaving the Home Depot in Allen, TX located at McDermott Dr and Highway 75. I noticed a strange black object (estimated 2000 - 3000ft in the air -- yet difficult to know for certain) that appeared at first to be a drone or a balloon (or even an object on a tether). The object appeared to waffle around in a near static location. It was very difficult to understand what I was looking at, as it didn't make sense the more I looked at it. After a couple of minutes of observation, the object began to head South and appeared to gain altitude, as it grew smaller in appearance. I attempted to take a very short video of the object in which you can see the object. However, the quality nor length was solid, as by the time I thought to film it, the object had already began to fade. While the object was staying in one location, it almost appeared that it was having difficulty maintaining flight (it was weird).  I tried to rule out the balloon theory, as the object headed South above highway 75 and according to the Aviation Weather Center, the wind barbs had the wind at 3000ft going at 35 knots from the West at the time of the sighting, which didn't line up with the direction the object was heading.  I can send the very short clip of the object to the e-mail below, you have to pause the video and look closely at the left side of the video to see the object.;33.0985956896552;-96.6532439655181
