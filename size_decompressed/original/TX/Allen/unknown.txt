Bright, Hovering Lights in the Plano/Allen, Texas Area 07-26-07;2007-07-26 22:45:00;Unknown;Bright, Hovering Lights in the Plano/Allen, Texas Area 07-26-07 Tonight, as I was driving home from a friend's house, I saw a really bright light in the sky.  I was on Parker Rd. on my way to Hwy 75 North from the direction of Custer Rd.  The bright light looked like it was hovering in mid air and not moving.  At first I thought it was a light on top of a building, but I had never seen it before, so I kept looking while I was driving.  Finally I pulled over into a bank parking lot on Parker Rd. near the street that leads to Hwy 75 North, to get a better look.  Very soon after I parked, the light went out and what looked like a low flying airplane flew over me in the sky.  I could hear the aircraft pass as it passed over me.  So, I thought nothing of it, because I was then pretty sure it was just an airplane, but after I got on 75 North heading towards Allen, TX, I saw the light again, now in a different place. Again, the light was stationary, not moving even a little bit from what I could see.  I called my fiance to see if he could see what I was seeing, but he was at work and could not see anything from his perspective.  He was in Richardson, about 20 minutes away from where I was when I called him. As I was speaking with my fiance on the phone, the light seemed to go out in a small sweeping motion from left to right, and then I could see flashing lights moving slowly.  By this time I had reached my exit, Exchange Pkwy, and I was only able to see the lights for a short while longer before I had to make the turn onto Exchange Pkwy heading west.  Once I started heading west, my back was to the lights and I couldn't track them anymore. While I was able to observe the lights, they looked closer together than a normal aircraft's lights would be, and the lights appeared to move in the same sweeping motion from left to right.  The motion of the lights made the flying object seem to be a circular shape rather than the shape of an airplane like I had seen when I parked in the bank parking lot on Parker Rd. Also, the lights, which I assume were attached to some sort of aircraft, were moving slowly across the sky and looked as thought they were making oddly angled turns, speeding up, although not very much, and slowing down as they went along.  There were three lights, all different colors.  I believe the colors were blue, red, and green, but they were hard to distinguish, because I was trying to watch the road and the thing in the sky at the same time.  I am not sure how long the event lasted, as I do not know when the light first appeared, nor was not able to stop my car to observe the whole thing. I do not drink, so consequently, I have not consumed any alcoholic beverages tonight, nor do I use/abuse drugs of any kind, legal or prescription.  The only medication I take daily is Wellbutrin XL for depression.  I do not have a history of any other psychiatric disorders, nor do I have a history of seeing odd things in the sky or anywhere else for that matter.  This is the first time I have ever witnessed anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));33.0985956896552;-96.6532439655181
