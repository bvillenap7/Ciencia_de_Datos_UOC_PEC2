I pulled into my driveway getting out I looked up into the sky and seen a black perfect circle moving north west to south east.  No sound of propulsion system.   I first, I thought it was a remote control toy.  As it became closer I realized this is not a toy since it passed directly over the house.   I could not tell the size of it due to clear skies.   I have witness two UFO's in my life.;33.0985956896552;-96.6532439655181
