The object hovers in the same area for a long period of time. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thank you for responding.  The object seemed sphere or disc shaped.  The object was extremely far away, but we were able to see every color.  At one point a plane flew under the object and we were able to see how large it was in comparison.  It was at least two or three times the size of the aircraft.  The object ended up hovering for over an hour that we saw.  At one point the object dipped down and we noticed a smaller object below it that was similar.  When the larger object reached the smaller one, all of the sudden the smaller object disappeared.  We then noticed a large plane that flew under the large object flying North. The large object then suddenly disappeared. Please understand that I have never believed in UFO's nor do I believe in conspiracy theories.  This is a true account of what we have seen. I was not alone in seeing this object.  I do have a recording but my camera is so bad that it is difficult to see any of the colors that we saw on the recording.  Also, the object seemed much smaller in the recording than in real life.  If you would like for me to send you an attachment I will be more than happy to provide the documentation.  If there is an explanation for what was seen, please let me know. Thank you!
