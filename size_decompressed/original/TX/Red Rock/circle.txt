I live out in the country so it is dark without the nuance of city lights.  I looked out at the horizon and and noticed a bright star shape that was stationary.  I thought this was strange due to the stars in the Heaven were stationed higher in the sky and the moon was behind me.  I thought maybe it could be a plane but it wasnâ€™t moving.  I went back inside to grab my phone to start videotaping the event.  I told my husband who came outside and he could not explain what it was either.  As I started videotaping, the object  changed shape from a star bright light appearance and started moving.  The object became a circle shape that was rotating and it was moving in a circular pattern in the sky.  Flashes of white and red were emitting from the object.  The object then moved straight up and forward in the sky passing over our house and went out of sight.  I have vid! eo of the object moving.;29.9895;-97.4121
