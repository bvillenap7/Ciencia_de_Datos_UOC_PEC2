I got up from my chair and went into the back yard,  My neighbors dog was barking.  I looked up into the sky and saw a big round (Sphere) Hovering about 100 feet above my house, I was about 6 feet across and was moving up and it would stop and would move up more the longer i looked at it.   I was like looking at a round mirror, I freeked out and went inside to get my camera and when i got outside it was gone.  I work for a airline that was not an aircraft, saw the same object 20 years ago in West Virginia on my familys farm.;33.1788;-97.06795
