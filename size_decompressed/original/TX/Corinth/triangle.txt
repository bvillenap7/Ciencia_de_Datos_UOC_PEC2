TRIANGLE OBJECT OVER CORINTH TX.;2006-06-12 08:00:00;5MIN;TRIANGLE OBJECT OVER CORINTH TX. MY SISTER CALLED TO TELL ME PEOPLE WERE CALLING A RADIO STATION SCREAMMING! THEY WERE ALL LOOKING AT THIS OBJECT OVER LEWISVILLE LAKE. I LIVE RIGHT NEXT TO LEWIVILLE LAKE AND CORINTH SO I CAN EASILY SEE ANYTHING THEY WERE SEEING. I LAUGHED AND SAID WHAT THE HECK. I TURNED MY LIGHTS OFF OUTSIDE AND TOLD MY HUSBAND AND SON ABOUT IT WHILE LISTENING TO THE RADIO AND THERE IT WAS. I THOUGHT IT WAS A HELICOPTER COMMING TOWARDS US BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND. EVERITHING WAS QUIET AND THE OBJECT WAS THERE . IT WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT AT FIRST LIKE THE FRONT OF IT THEN IT TURNED SLOWLY AND WE SAW THE REST OF THE LIGHTS. ALL WHITE  LOOK LIKE THIS ^ WHITH LIGHTS IN ALL SIDES AND WHEN IT TOOK OFF IT MADE A GHOSTLY WIND SOUND. I CANT EXPLAIN . NEVER HEARD ANY SOUND LIKE IT. TOOK OFF QUICK FROM NORTH TO WEST THEN TOWARDS CARROLTON . FOR SOME REASON IT KEPT HANGING OROUND WATER AREAS. I SAW IT NEXT TO THE WATER TOWER. DONT BELIEVE IN ALIENS BUT THIS REALY FREAKED ME OUT. BY THE WAY MY HUSBAND SAYS HE DID NOT SEE A THING. HE WAS THE ONE THAT TOLD ME IT COULD NOT BE A HELICOPTER BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SOUND.HE JUST DOESENT WANT TO SOUND STUPID. I DONT CARE I KNOW WHAT I SAW  AND MY KID SAW IT TOO. KIDS DONT LIE ABOUT THOSE THINGS. ANYONE ELSE SAW THIS OR AM I GOING NUTS?
