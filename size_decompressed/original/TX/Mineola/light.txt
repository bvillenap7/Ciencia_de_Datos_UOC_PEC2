I was mowing my back yard, just finishing up. I pulled up to my gate and before i went to open it, i had to urinate. During the process i was looking at the sky, then i saw what looked just like a bright star moving fast but at a choppy speed. As i watched it moved a good distance before slowly disappearing into the darkness.It was moving too slow to be a shooting star, but to fast to be a plane or chopper. The sky was fairly clear,And i also gauged the distance of disappearance with two planes,The planes disappeared over the tree line. The light disappeared into the sky.The color of the craft or whatever it appeared white like a star. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
