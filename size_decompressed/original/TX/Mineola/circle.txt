One Hovering craft...Multi-colored lights...Possible USAF persuit!;1999-04-05 21:10:00;10min;One Hovering craft...Multi-colored lights...Possible USAF persuit! My father and I were traveling down a County road (1801) seven miles east of Mineola. We looked up in the sky in an (45o angle) open field to see a circular object with multi-colored lights on it! We stopped the car and turned off the engine. We didn't hear a sound from the object. It then started moving west slowly. My father and I then witnessed the object all of a sudden go the opposite direction toward the east. There was no banking/turning for this maneuver! We then saw it speeding up toward the east, a sound was then comming from the sky as we witnessed two jets going very fast, pass overhead. They were not commercial or private aircraft...and there isn't a military base around here for hundreds of miles. They couldn't keep up with the object and it left them in it's wake very quickly. My father has seen other strange hapenings over the years in that area...we own some land out there where this happened. My father and I are well respected members of the community. We were born and raised in Mineola, and our family has lived in the area for over one-hundred years. My family and I own a local business, My father is employed with a local utility company.;32.6664;-95.4825
