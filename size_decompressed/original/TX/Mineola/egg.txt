Saw a metalic football shaped object traveling 200 to 250 mph at  about 1000 to 1500 ft. No sound,no windows,no wings ,no trail .;2005-10-15 16:00:00;40sec.;Saw a metalic football shaped object traveling 200 to 250 mph at  about 1000 to 1500 ft. No sound,no windows,no wings ,no trail . I was sitting on the back porch at around 4 pm on a beautiful clear day in October of 2005. My house faces north and I was facing south and as I looked over my left shoulder to the east I saw an egg or football shaped object.  It was a shinny metalic object and from where I sat I could see the reflection of the sun on the rear end.  It had no windows,wings,stabilizer or anything sticking out. It made no sound and left no trail behind it and my best estimation of it's speed was 200 to 250 mph and an altitude of around  1000 to 1500 ft. I called my wife out to see it so we both saw the same thing. In Oct. of 2006 I was sitting on the same porch with the same kind of weather and looked east and saw a contrail of a very high flying airplne. It was so high I could not see the craft it's self so I went into the house and got the bynocuylars.  As I was looking at the plane this very same egg shaped craft flew trough my field of vision and was traveling very fast(est.3 or 4000 mph) on incline upwards. I was employed by a major airline for 27 years so I do know the difference. I have never seen this type of craft before ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));32.6664;-95.4825
