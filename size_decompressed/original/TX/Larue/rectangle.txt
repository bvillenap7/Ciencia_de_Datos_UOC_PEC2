Bright orange light in Southeastern sky near New York, Texas.;2019-06-13 20:20:00;5 min.;Bright orange light in Southeastern sky near New York, Texas. Approximately 8:20 pm on June 13, 2019, my husband and I were outside on our property near New York, Texas.  We saw a bright orange light equivalent to a bright security light in the south eastern sky.  It was moving slowly to the southwest.   We watched it for about 2 minutes going to the southwest.  It looked like it was moving away from us for about 15 seconds and suddenly it was totally out of sight.;32.1616;-95.5945
