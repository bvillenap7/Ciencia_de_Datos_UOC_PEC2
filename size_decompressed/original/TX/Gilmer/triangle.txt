Triangluar lighted craft in night sky.;2007-08-25 00:12:00;5 minutes;Triangluar lighted craft in night sky. I was driving along a country road near the town I live in because of a detour for road construction when I saw a red light in the sky.  It was far in the distance and hovering so I naturally assumed it was a tower.  As I drove further about a mile and approached the local high school a craft came hovering above me close to the ground but still very far in the sky.  I stopped my car and rolled the window down to have an unobstructed view, it was triangle in shape which I could tell even in the night sky and had large white lights lining each side, something I have never seen in a normal aircraft, there was also a red and blue blinking light, something I have seen in an aircraft which led me to question whether it were really a ufo or not.  However it was moving slowly and making no noise, and definetly triangular in shape.  It went across the sky and dissapeared behind the tree line.;32.6717763440861;-94.917930107527
