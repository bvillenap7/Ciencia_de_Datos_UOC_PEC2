My husband and I saw the same lights in the same area about three weeks later. They would light up then one would fade out and another one would light up each time they did this same thing then they would just disappear. Each time it was only lights that we saw. It was dark with no moon. They were all in a line moving from north to south approximately 20 or 30 miles from us. This is a very rural area without many city lights the population of our entire county is less than 8000. and there aren't any large airport close to us.;32.1068;-98.5557
