Saw two bright redish/orange lights;2012-01-10 20:00:00;6 secs;Saw two bright redish/orange lights I was watching tv at my house about 5 miles east of De leon right off of highway 6.  After listening for a few minutes to what sounded like jets, I walked outside and saw two balls or reddish/orange light to the south.  They stayed in on spot for a few seconds, then they went in to a rapid decent, only to disappear.  Then when I looked up there was about 10 or 15 jets that all seemed to all be heading for the area where I had just saw the lights.  It was like a giant light show in the sky from all the jets.;32.1068;-98.5557
