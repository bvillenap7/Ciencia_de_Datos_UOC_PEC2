Flying Triangle object Martin County, TX.;2016-01-31 23:10:00;4 seconds;Flying Triangle object Martin County TX Sunday Jan 31st, 2016, at approximately 11:10 pm, I saw a flying triangle shaped object, with no lights traveling thru the sky in a westerly direction over Stanton, Texas.  The object appeared to slightly reflect ambient light from the ground and was noticed because it was a few shades lighter than the night sky.   I estimate its altitude at about 80 feet, and its size to be about 30 feet at the tail.  It made no noise that I could hear.  It appeared to going about 60 to 80 mph easily gliding through the sky with no resistance.   I had a visual of the object for about 4 seconds.  I cannot be certain as to its size, or speed as I am not a trained observer.   I can say for sure I have never seen an object like this. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite serious-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good, reliable witness.  PD));32.1419;-101.814
