Huge black rectangle over Hutto, Texas.;2015-10-10 15:30:00;2 minutes;Huge black rectangle over Hutto, Texas At approximately 3:30 in the afternoon, on October 10, I was sitting on our third-floor balcony, facing South, in Round Rock, Texas.  I looked to the left (East) and saw what must have been an enormous black rectangle moving slowly over Hutto, Texas, approximately 8 miles away. I immediately grabbed a pair of binoculars and confirmed that it was very large, and rectangular in shape.  It was moving slowly North, much like a blimp would move, but it was too big to be a blimp (given how far away it was), and it was not rounded on the ends like a blimp, but squared on all four corners. I then called my brother out to the balcony (we are both retired teachers in our fifties).  He came out and agreed that it was unlike anything heâ€™d ever seen, that it was far away (again, about eight miles), black, rectangular in shape, and huge.  We watched it for about a minute as it slowly moved to the north, and then out of sight behind the wall of our apartment building. It was a clear day, with no clouds in the sky.  The object moved smoothly, and slowly.  There were no lights on the object, or any other features that we could see.  We could hear no sound associated with it. I am emailing a photo with an Illustrator-created rendering of the object.  This is the view from our balcony, looking east toward Hutto, Texas.  The water tower indicated in the photo is about 8 miles away.;30.5238;-97.565
