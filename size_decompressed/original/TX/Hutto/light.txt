Two lights in the sky, looked like fast irratic moving stars;2012-07-04 22:10:00;30 seconds;Two lights in the sky, looked like fast irratic moving stars My fiance and I were outside laying on our children's trampoline watching the stars an occasionally a firework when two star like objects began mingling in the sky.  They went closer almost as one and then split apart and went separate ways.  They were very high in the atmosphere and we knew so when we seen a shooting star below where they were flying.  We followed the lights one disappeared suddenly and we watched the other keep going until it was no longer visible (20 seconds)  There was no sound. We live close enough to see planes fly out of nearby airports and never have they flown in that area at night or have we ever see a plane cross paths with another.;30.5238;-97.565
Two orange lights fly at eachother and become one.;2013-08-25 21:00:00;20-30 seconds;Two orange lights fly at eachother and become one. While doing some night fishing with a friend in Hutto, Texas on Sunday, August 25th, around 9pm, we saw a bright orange light, way above us in the sky.  It was going from left to right.  Seconds later,  seemingly out of nowhere, a second light appeared heading straight for the first.  We thought we were going to see a mid air collision but instead the 2 lights became one and continued in the direction of the first light.;30.5238;-97.565
