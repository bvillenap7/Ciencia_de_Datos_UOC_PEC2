White silent orbs 2nd sighting This is the second sighting of white, round and silent orb type objects above traveling slowly and then vanish. The first time we witnessed 4 of these orbs in-line with each other staying stationary for almost a minute then going off in separate ways and banish. Totally silent, bright white light . Did not hurt eyes while witnessing. I have picture of second sighting that I will try to attach to this message;30.5238;-97.565
