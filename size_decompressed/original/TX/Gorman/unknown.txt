Orange lights Southwestern Sky, Gorman Texas;2009-01-29 19:30:00;10 minutes;Orange lights Southwestern Sky, Gorman Texas Driving into Gorman Texas on 8, I witnessed lights in the southwestern sky, did not seem to move across the horizon and as best I can describe them where similar to military flares deployed from aircraft, however they were orange in color as opposed to the military bright white. Lights moved horizonitally back and forth and then stopped and contiuned much like a landing zone or run way, then looked like a angel wing display emitted from a c130. This is the best I can describe, as I have no comparison ever seen by myself before.;32.2199;-98.6819
