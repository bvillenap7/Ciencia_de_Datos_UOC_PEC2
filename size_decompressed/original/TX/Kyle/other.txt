Standing outside, witnessed a red and blueish object of know distinct shape.  It was falling towards earth at a quick rate, to fast for plane yet well (sic. way) too slow for a shooting star.  It dropped below a house line and was the last i saw of it.  I'm very skeptical of things like this, but this absolutely baffled me.  Unexplainable.   While observing the sky afterwards in the same direction I saw object I noticed a stationary star like object that was also red and blueish about the size of bigger stars in sky yet strangely different then a star.  Also was some weird bright blinking going on once every 30 seconds or so for about 10 mins.  This I would see out of corner of my eye why focusing on star like object a little lower.  Again Bizzarest (sic.  most bizarre) thing I have ever seen.  Tryed to take video of star like object with phone as no time to react to first object sighted but is very dark and can't see anything special about it do to low quality;30.0031999999996;-97.8396999999987
