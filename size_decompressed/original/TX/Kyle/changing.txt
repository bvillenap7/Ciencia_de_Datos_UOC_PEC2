My wife, son, and myself witnessed 3 lights in a straight row that changed to a triangle and back to a straight row.  The lights were just above the horizon.  They seemed to twinkle an amber color and white.  They looked like airplane lights but stayed in a hovering formation.  After taking pictures and a video within about 3 minutes one light started to fade in and out.  All 3 lights started to lower toward the horizon.  Before we went into the house 2 of the lights had dropped below the horizon.  We watched for a total of about 4 minutes.  This was in West Kyle, TX, looking East/Northeast.;30.0031999999996;-97.8396999999987
