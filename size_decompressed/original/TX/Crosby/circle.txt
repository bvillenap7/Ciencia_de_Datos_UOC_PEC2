After we pulled over and took a picture three more appeared below the first two. the three below them appeared to take the shape of Orion's belt.  the first two also had flashing lights around the main light.  They also seemed to move back and forth, they would break line and then reform it.  At first, I  thought they were supernovas the way they were glowing and sparking around the edges.  we didn't hear any noises because we had the windows rolled up. as we turned down another road to get closer look, a man on an ATV was honking at us and pointing the other way like he wanted us to leave.;29.9225;-95.0614999999999
