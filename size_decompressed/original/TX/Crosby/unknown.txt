About 0430 I needed to use the restroom and notices it was very dark in the house.  I thought their must be no moon tonight.  I opened my curtain to take a look around and saw a flash about as bright as a medium star.  I thought it was an airplane.  I kept watching as as it continues to flash about once every 5 seconds or so, I decided to go downstairs and look from outside and noticed that this flash did not move.  I used to work in the navy and I know what aircraft look like at night and I knew it was not an aircraft.  I thought it might be something else but I have no idea what.  I tried to record on my iPhone but it does not show anything.  Perhaps it could be professionally edited to show this pulsing or flashing light.   After a minute of watching from outside it seemed to become more faint and moved away from me into space.  I can't recall how bright it was initially from my bedroom window, I guess because I had just woke up.  After the thing was gone a quick streak went across the sky like a shooting star.;29.9225;-95.0614999999999
