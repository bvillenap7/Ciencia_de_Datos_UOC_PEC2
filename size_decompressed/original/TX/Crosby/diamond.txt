I also observed the object, stationary in the sky, a bright white light, star shaped, with red blue and green colors around it  We observed it for approx. 10 minutes before it disappeared.  I am a 52 year old police officer, also am licensed pilot,both fixed wing and helicopter.  The object made no noise as we observed it.   in  my opinion it was not a conventional aircraft.;29.9225;-95.0614999999999
