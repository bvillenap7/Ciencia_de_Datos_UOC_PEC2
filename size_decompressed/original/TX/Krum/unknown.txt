Bright light in sky observed on and off for 10 months now;1998-01-17 16:30:00;Still there;Bright light in sky observed on and off for 10 months now For nearly 10 months now I have been observing some unual lights in the sky.  All started one night on the way home from work where I dont usually get off until 12:30AM.  I have tried to rule out airplanes and stars but the light never moves and is too big to be a star.   I understand about gases on survice of stars and how they give off color.   What I have been seeing are different colors together but they are in a straight line with usually a bright white light slightly below. I've pointed these lights out to my Son and Husband but their reaction is..it's a star.  Well, tonight I saw the biggest and brightest one of all since Christmas Eve, 2008.  The light was much, much lower then previous lights and therefore was bigger they most lights I have seen. I came out my back door around 8:30PM to go to town to grocery store.  I watched the light for several minutes before pulling our of driveway and it never changed position.  Went to townm did my shopping and when I came back out the light was still there. As I drove home (going West out of Denton, TX) I continued to observe the light.  When I arrived at home it appeared to have gone further West of where I had first observed it but still very bright and low.  I mentioned it to my Husband when he came outside and he confirmed that he had seen it earlier...about two hours ago. I have been seeing similar lights now over the past 10 months.  They appear for several nights in a row and then disappear only to reappear later.  Sometimes they come back in different location.  They always have the same appearance.  A even level of colored lights with a singular white light slightly lower to the left.;33.271;-97.2691
