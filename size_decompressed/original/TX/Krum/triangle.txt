Two red triangles slowly and silently fly single file over Krum, Texas;2010-11-09 18:30:00;4 minutes;Two red triangles slowly and silently fly single file over Krum, Texas On or about November 9, 2010 west of Krum, Texas at about 6 or 7pm my best friend and I were on my front porch enjoying the weather when a fully red aircraft came slowly and silently from the south headed perfectly north.  I said to my friend, “Hey, check that out.  What is that?”  We walked to the field by my house to get a sight free of trees and we stood looking at this deep red triangular craft.  The craft had one bright red light located off-center of the rear, but very close to centered.  The situation that shocked us the most was that we could clearly see how red the craft was.  We watched as it moved north slowly.  About a minute or two later we noticed another identical craft coming from the south on the same flight path.  We watched this one follow suit exactly as the first one. So, call us hicks or liars, but this is what happened.   Thanks for having a reporting system like this, and thank you for your time.;33.271;-97.2691
