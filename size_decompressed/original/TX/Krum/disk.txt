Observed at 10:45 PM for about 10 minutes Jan 13, 2011 UFO sighting. I was driving home from Dallas to my home which is about 65 NW of Dallas.  Shortly after passing through the town of Krum on FM 1173 I noticed two orbs in the sky fairly close together.  There is not much skylight here because it is very rural, so the stars are easily noticed on a clear night.  The moon was easily seen, but the stars were not because of cloud cover.  These two orbs were very evident ahead of me on the left side of the road.  The closer I got, I could rule out approaching planes to DFW Airport.  They were too low and barely moving.  More like a hover..  the outline of the crafts had a white/gold light.  Red light was also noticed.  As I ruled out possible explanations, I decided not to call 911 or my Onstar emergency button.   A.) They probably would not believe me and  B.)  What could they do?  So I called my daughter who was home, to have a “witness” and in case I didn’t get home. During that call, one craft disappeared. I described the other and by this time I could loo! k underneath the craft.  There were red and white round lights under it. Maybe 5 or 6 and not symmetrical.  I looked for the other one.  It was now on the right side of the road.  Those lights were turned off, except some dim red light underneath, but I could see the outline of the craft.  There was some movement from the orbs but very little.  I passed them. When I looked back, I could no longer see either of the orbs. I am reporting this in case someone else does, to verify or be verified. Wow, that was a first for me!;33.271;-97.2691
Fighter jets being followed by silver disc heading towards Lockheed in Ft. Worth, TX.;2016-10-22 14:25:00;15 seconds;Fighter jets being followed by silver disc heading towards Lockheed in Ft. Worth TX I was outside trimming trees in the yard. Heard jet aircraft approaching from the north east heading south west.  I looked up to see two fighter type jets flying side by side not very fast. Behind them was a silver saucer disc shaped craft tagging along.  I watched as they flew over the tree line trying to get a better look at the disc but I couldn't.  Southwest of here is Alliance airport, and Lockheed Martin in Ft. Worth where the jets come from.  Not sure if the jets were escorting the craft or if the craft was being annoying by following the jets.;33.271;-97.2691
