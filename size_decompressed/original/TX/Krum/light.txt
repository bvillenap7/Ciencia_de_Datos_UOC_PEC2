one giant bright light and numerous small white lights the size of stars in Krum, Texas.  ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??  PD));2010-09-29 22:00:00;5-6 hrs;one giant bright light and numerous small white lights the size of stars in Krum, Texas. There was one bright one, it looked like it could be the size of a planet.  And the rest, which were the size of stars, were too numerous to count.  My boyfriend and I noticed them around 10 pm last night in the eastern sky. They were flying west and looked like they were shooting something.  And at one point closer to morning, four of the smaller ones formed a diamond shape. ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??
