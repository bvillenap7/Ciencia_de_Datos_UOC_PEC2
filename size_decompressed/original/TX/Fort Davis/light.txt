MY HUSBAAND AND I WERE STANDING ON OUR DECK AT 220 AM ON JULY 20 AND WE OBSERVED LIGHTS THAT MOVED IN AN L SHAPE CHANGING COLORES OF RED BLUE GREEN. IT MOVED UP AND THEN DOWN. THE LIGHTS WERE SOLID AND THE MOVEMENT WAS FAST. WE WATCHED WITH OUR NECKED EYES AT FIRST, THEN BOTH OF US WATCHED WITH OUR BINOCULARS.IT WAS COLD, SO WE WENT BACK INSIDE AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE HAD OBSERVED. SINCE MY HUSBAND WAS IN THE AIR FORCE IN THE 60's and trained to observe planes, as he was a fireman and in the security service.we were looking in the north western sky. The next day we looked at our texas map to see what was out there. It was between  Van Horn and Kent' Texas.We are in the davis, mountains ,so the object had to be high in the sky for us to be able to observe it.;30.6131;-103.9364
