green fireball sightings in Texas;2007-08-08 20:00:00;3-4 minutes;green fireball sightings in Texas My husband and l were sitting out on the back deck of our mountain vacation cabin (a VERY remote area in the Davis Mountains, just south of the McDonald Observatory) watching for the Perseids meteor showers last August.   We saw some meteors in the north sky, then an odd thing happened. A green fireball appeared, very low in the western sky (to our left) and moved slowly- horizontally-from north to south.  We lost sight of it as we were on the north end of the cabin and it was moving in the other direction.  We at first thought it was part of the meteor shower, but the direction, color, and seemingly languid movement seemed unlike any other meteors we have seen in these darkTexas skies in the past.  ls this an unusual phenomenon?  My son and l saw another green fireball object on Dec. 31, 1995 on a dark, rural country road in east Texas (near Tyler's Lake Palestine).  This object  also moved horizontally and slowly in front of us there were 2 other cars in front of us who had stopped to view this object so l assume that it was a strange event for them, as well!;30.6131;-103.9364
