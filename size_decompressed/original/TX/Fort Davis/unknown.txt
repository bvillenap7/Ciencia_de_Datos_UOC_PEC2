We were on top of a small mountain at a retired Navy captain's home near the Davis Mountains and the McDonald Observatory in West Texas.  We were using night sight binoculars while looking at the sky because it allowed us to see ten times more stars than with the naked eye alone.  I am an attorney.  The other witnesses include the owner of a large telephone company and an oil and gas heir. I was watching as several satellites passed across the sky.  About the third satellite I watched made it half way across the sky, nearly directly overhead, and just stopped.  It stayed in place for five seconds and then started moving in a new direction, about 100 degrees from its original direction.  It made several more course changes while it began moving at what must have been thousands of miles per hour. I handed the binoculars to the other people there and they also watched the satellite complete incredible maneuvers in a lot of different directions.  After about ten minutes of impossibly fast and extremely angular turns and flight, it shot across the sky past the horizon. We did not see it again. Whatever it was, it was invisible without the night vision Navy issue binoculars and it moved faster than anything the public is aware of.;30.6131;-103.9364
