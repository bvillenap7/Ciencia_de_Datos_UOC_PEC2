My wife and I were watering our garden.  We were looking at the half moon in the sky.   Directly overhead in the upper stratosphere we observed a satellite moving from west to east.  As the satellite disappeared from sight in the east, another brighter light (to the south of where the light had originated) was moving at a high rate of speed.   As the satellite disappeared from the east, an object from the southwest running parallel with the flat path of the satellite came across the sky at a high rate of speed.  Directly overhead the object made a right angle turn north for a few sconds, then another right angle turn to the east, then yet another right angle turn to the north, and yet finally  another right angle turn to the east on approximately the same flight plan as the satellite.   The object then appeared to shoot straight up in the sky and disappeared from sight, slightly moving towards the east.
