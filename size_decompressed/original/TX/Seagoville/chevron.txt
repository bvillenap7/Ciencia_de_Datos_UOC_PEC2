It was one night when I was with one of my friends and i notice something in the sky. I look to the sky and saw a light that was not far away from me.  As i saw it, i notice it came closer.I immeditaly knew that this was not some star, but something more odd and mysterious. I told my freind to look up and the first thing he said was,'holy crap thats a ufo'!  The ufo look like it was like a boombrang or chevron with two big yellowish-reddish circle lights at the bottom.  It lasted about 24 seconds up in the air until it came way to much close to me and my freind.  For a moment i thought it was going to abduct us but instead flew over us. It made no sound when this happpen. After it passed i look to the sky to try to see it again but had quickly vanished .
