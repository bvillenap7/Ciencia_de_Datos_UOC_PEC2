It is very common to see air craft in the area as it is a flight way into Dallas Love Field and DFW.  My son was driving, when I thought I was looking at Aircraft with there lights on to land. This one iod not have the navigational, red, green, and stobe.  We stopped on the side of the shoulder, it was a starry night with no clouds. The craft was a triangle with 3 large orange lights on underside, like the HWY sodium lights in color, that would pulsate slowly bright then dimmer. They did this the entire time we watched it. It also had approx. 7 lights all along its outside edges.with one on each point of the craft.  As we stopped to watch it, we rolled down or windows and turned car off, no noise came from the craft. It was moving slower than the on coming traffic. I have flown in both   small and large aircraft over a hundred times.  The craft appeared to be 100 yards across, sillouetted against the bright starry sky. It appeared to be black except for the lights of course. I first thought it had to military, something new in the inventory.  It just slowly kept following the Hwy heading west 70 degrees to our left or to the outh of us. We watched as long as we could see it as it flew into Dallas airspace and blended in with all the other planes coming and going out of Dallas. The craft flew at about 1200 feet, as I fly powered parachutes and you have to learn tower heights and such;32.6557;-96.5565999999999
