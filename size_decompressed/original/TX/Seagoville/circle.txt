Flight speed/velocity was very high. On zeroing and focusing this object, it propelled at a fantastic speed/velocity and in about two to five seconds it dissappeared into the sky. I looked back up into the same direction of the  skies and suddenly saw another simeilar flying object about 10 degrees to my left ( heading west on Highway 175) from the first sighting in my moving vihecle. This second object also flew very fast that it dissappeared into the skies in about the same time and speed/velocity as the first sighting. I called 911 on my cell phone and was given a number to call and report my sighting. Note: After merging into I-635 north at about the Seagoville Road exit, I did see a flying jet (aeroplance that does appear the same as my previous sighting- because it had a parrellel or straight shape) heading east (at about 15:31p.m. Texas time) and it did not speed or move in the skies as fast as the circular objects that I saw previously and did not dissappear so fast as my first other two observations did. In fact the aeroplane or jet stayed in sight untill I hit the Gross road exit on I-635 north in mesquite.;32.6557;-96.5565999999999
Bright, red ball with no noise and changed directions then shot off and disappeared;2013-01-01 00:15:00;2-3 minutes;Bright, red ball with no noise and changed directions then shot off and disappeared My husband, my 14-year old son, and I stepped out onto our back patio after my husband noticed something in the sky that he initially thought was a firework.  It was a brilliant, bright red light that moved from West to East across the sky.   It was traveling much faster than an airplane and it momentarily changed direction mid-flight upwards and then resumed course West to East.   There was no noise coming from the object.   As it approached closer to us it was quite large and very, very bright red, almost glowing.   As it got closer to us the object stopped mid-flight and shot off away from us.   Itâ€™s like it disappeared into nowhere.  We were quite shaken up as it was very unusual.;32.6557;-96.5565999999999
