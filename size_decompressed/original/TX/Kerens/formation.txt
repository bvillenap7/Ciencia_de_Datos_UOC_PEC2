UFO spotted at Possum Kingdom Lake,TX;2008-01-17 07:55:00;15 seconds;UFO spotted at Possum Kingdom Lake,TX Excellent road visibility road conditions.  Very cold outside and there was a dark grey overcast sky.  I could not see the sunlight break the cloud cover. I was traveling north and before I made a left hand turn into the main gate at work that morning, five,large, white,very bright lights caught my eye.   I stopped in the road and watched them or it for about fifteen seconds.  They were arranged in a sort of half V formation, like a backwards checkmark.  It, or they, were moving very slowly,heading north, and very low to the ground.  I could hear no sound from the lights.   My windows were rolled up, however the military has jets flying over this area very often and if they are low enough to the ground you can hear them with the windows rolled up.   Also, later that day, while traveling with a coworker in his suv truck, I observed a jet flying overhead and noticed how loud it was and how small in comparison it looked to the lights in the sky I observed that morning, and the jet was flying pretty low.
