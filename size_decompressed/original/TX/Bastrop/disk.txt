I WAS DRIVING ON HIGHWAY 20 HEADING NORTH, ABOUT 5 MILES SOUTH OF THE HIGHWAY 71 INTERSECTION IN BASTROP TEXAS.  I SAW ONE SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT HEADING FROM EAST TO WEST.  IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING VERY FAST AND IN A STRAIGHT LINE.  I WATCHED IT ABOUT 30 SECONDS BEFORE IT CHANGED COURSE BY MOVING UP AT ABOUT A 30 DEGREE ANGLE AND DISAPPEARING INTO A CLOUD.  THE CLOUD WAS NOT LARGE AND WAS VERY THIN.  THE OBJECT NEVER CAME OUT OF THE CLOUD.  WITHIN THE NEXT 5 MINUTES THE CLOUD BEGAN BREAKING UP AND BECAME VERY WISPY.  I NEVER SAW THE OBJECT AGAIN.  THE SKY WAS MOSTLY CLEAR AT THE TIME WITH JUST A FEW CLOUDS. THE UFO WAS SHAPED LIKE A DEEP FRYING PAN WITH NO HANDLE.  IT WAS SLIGHTLY WIDER AT THE TOP THAN THE BOTTOM.  ITS COLOR APPEARED TO CHANGE FROM WHITE TO SILVER TO ALMOST TRANSPARENT, IN THIS ORDER AND IN SHORT PULSES.;30.1388000000001;-97.2920999999994
