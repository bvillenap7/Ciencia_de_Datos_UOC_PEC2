Watched multicolored object in sky move oddly for over 10 minutes.;2020-08-03 23:40:00;10 minutes plus;Watched multicolored object in sky move oddly for over 10 minutes. I was outside on my porch at approximately 11:40 pm in a north west direction I saw what looked like a plane at first. I watched for well over 10 minutes the object move left, right, up and down.  The object never moved quickly, more bobbed about slowly.  As stated I watched for a good amount of time and pointed it out to my wife.  The object continued in a north west direction and eventually got behind trees I could not see clearly through.;30.1388000000001;-97.2920999999994
