September 21, 2007  To whom it may concern ,  My dad and I were practicing baseball and then we saw a falcon and watched it fly.  Suddenly out of nowhere we saw an object that was all silver and it had two wings in the front and two wings in the back. I would say that it was 1000 feet in the air. It hovered and then backed up went up and down with a very controlled pattern. Then my dad told me to get my mom to show her and right when we got outside it disappeared out of thin air.   We saw I about 4:13 p.m.  Iâ€™ve waited so long to file this report in hope what I saw will make since. This object was not far enough away for there to be any confusion about what I saw. To this day my father and I think about it.;30.1388000000001;-97.2920999999994
