I am familiar with the the visual sensation known as hysteresis I.e., a light will seem to move if stared at for a time.   While observing the night sky near Austin TX at about 6:15 pm,  I noticed a light in the high western sky which was barely discernable moving approximately south to north.   I assumed it was a satellite, but it soon started to turn in a curving motion.  It also slowed to almost a stop and then accelerated sharply.  The actions it took could not have been that of a satellite or high flying aircraft.  I kept sight of the light for at least 2 or 3 minutes before I lost it.   A few minutes later I picked up another light with similar actions.  As stated it had all the appearance of a high flying satellite but no satellite could possible move like this light.   Anyone else closely observing the night sky at this time could not have failed to see the same movement as I did.  I would like to know if this happened or if there is a natural explanation for what I saw.  I saw something similar several moths ago but did not report it.;30.1388000000001;-97.2920999999994
Seemingly very high altitude light/object  moving at various speeds, and not in a straight line.;2005-11-07 18:15:00;15 minutes;Seemingly very high altitude light/object moving at various speeds, and not in a straight line. This evening after dusk I observed what seemed to be a very high light, barely discernible moving much like the way I described in my report Nov 6.   The first light I observed made an almost complete circle around the crescent moon.  From ground level it is impossible to verify the height, shape or speed of the object, however it seems to be extremely high in the sky.  I believe the light is reflected off the sun much like observed satellites at this time of evening/night, because after dark I was no longer to see the moving light/object.  To reiterate, the light/object in no way moves like a satellite or aircraft.   I cannot help but feel other people must be observing the same pehnomena if they are closely watching the night sky after dusk, in this case approximately 6:15 Central.;30.1388000000001;-97.2920999999994
