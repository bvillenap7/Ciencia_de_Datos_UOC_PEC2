This cylinder was flying so fast it was over the horizon in less than 10 seconds.  I have never seen anything fly this fast as it ascended and gained altitude.  I presume it had landed and was taking off.   There were no propellors, rotors, wings, or jet pods.   Although the sighting was only seconds long, I got a good look at it, and another man in a white suv was  staring with his mouth open in apparent near shock.   This is what I saw, and I'm going back out tonight and observe the area again which is cow and horse pasture land.   This is all for now.
