At approximately 4:15pm on Monday the 23rd of February, I was on my back deck testing my spa water when I heard a passenger jet passing overhead. I looked up to see it passing overhead. Then I noticed out of the corner of my eye, a flash of color in the sky to my far right. I turned and looked to see a green ball of light with an orange tail shooting from west to east at an altitude of about 20,000 ft. It was the size of a pea at arms length. There were low gray clouds, but this green ball was below them. There was no sound, and after 3 seconds, it just vanished. The jet was traveling from southwest to northeast almost directly to where I first noticed the ball of light. Austin Bergstrom International Airport is about 24 miles east of my house. It reminded me exactly of the green ball that shoots out of a roman candle firework except the tail was short and orange. It looked a lot like a meteor that just enters the sky and burns up in the atmoshpere. I didn't think much of the sighting until I read your site with the mutiple sightings of about the exact same thing that I saw that day.;30.1388000000001;-97.2920999999994
