Three dark low flying objects, no lights, no sound, illuminated by the city lights of Bastrop, Tx.;2013-04-30 22:00:00;<1 minute;Three dark low flying objects, no lights, no sound, illuminated by the city lights of Bastrop, Tx. I had just gotten out of my car and was going into work when I noticed three objects in the sky flying in a formation (in a row).  I thought they were large birds, but as the objects went over the building I could see they weren't.  They didn't have any visible lights and were relatively low because the city lights were shining off them and that's why I could see them.  They appeared dark gray in color and shaped somewhat like a plane but they didn't make a sound as they went over.  They were moving to the North West.;30.1388000000001;-97.2920999999994
