Transparent saucer followed by F-4  Phantoms.  ((NUFORC Note:  May not be a serious report.  PD));1977-06-10 15:00:00;10 min;Transparent saucer followed by F-4  Phantoms I was driving south on hi-way 281 about 50 miles south of Kingsville tx. when I saw to my right 2 F-4 phantoms about 300 ft in the sky and coming over the road way in front of me real slow that's when I notice they where following a saucer shaped UFO which was transparent. They few across the road and kept going headed to the east ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  Witness also elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  We suspect that this may not be a serious-minded report, principally because M-D F-4 Phantoms would not fly at 300 feet altitude at a slow airspeed.  It would be more likely that they would orbit above a target, maintaining high airspeed, and the advantage of a greater altitude that their target.  PD));27.4263646153846;-97.8412323076922
