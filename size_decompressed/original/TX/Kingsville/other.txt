It began to rain very very hard and it was a bit dark as is typical with a hard thunderstorm.  As I drove past the county line, I notice something strange perhaps 500 feet or so in front of me and covering the road and also to the left side into the grass.  It was raining hard, yet I noticed an oblong spot, about 20ft at the widest and 50ft long that seemed darker to include the grass side on the right.  It visibly was wet, yet I could clearly see it was not raining in this area.  Further, as I drove into this area, it stopped raining as if I had driven under a bridge during a rain storm and the rain resumed as soon as I exited this small area.  The impression I got was of something hovering in this area.  There are no bridges etc in this strip of freeway north of Kingsville.  I looked in the area above the non raining area and saw nothing, but storm clouds.  I did not hear anything at all as I passed into this small are, only the end of rain and then the begining of rain as is typical of driving under a bridge during a rainstorm.   I am convinced something was hovering over this spot on the freeway.... just have no idea what it was as it was not visible to my eye, yet could see above and saw nothing unusual.;27.4263646153846;-97.8412323076922
