Star like object that appeared moving slowly due south then increased speed.  Did not change direction.;1998-06-15 05:47:00;1 minute;Star like object that appeared moving slowly due south then increased speed.  Did not change direction. While walking in Dick Kleberg County park at 0547 spotted an object that looked at first like a star that was stationary, then began to move at first slowly then increased speed.  It was too far away to judge speed, but I first spotted the object at about 45 degrees looking due west and it dissappeared at about 110 degree, the event lasting about a minute.  Object gave appearce of a star, whitish in color, but did not twinkle, no blinking, more like the reflection of light from an object sufficiently high in the atmosphere reflect sunlight despite that it was still very dark in the park.  I have walked in the park for the last 18 months from 0530 to 0630 and have essentially identified all the air traffic that flies overhead from the airports in the vicinity, and this object was a new object and did not appear to be an aircraft.;27.4263646153846;-97.8412323076922
Nocternal Visitation;2000-12-31 04:00:00;unknown;Nocternal Visitation Experienced something very very strange.  Sometime before 0402 hours today, have the feeling I was visited.  For the past five years (since 1995) while sleeping have dreamed that my house, a two story is tilting to the west and crashing into the street.  This morning, I awoke for some reason.  I lay awake and suddenly hear a low frequency buz or vibration and then hear noise, not sure what it was but almost at the same time sense I and my entire house tilting again to the west as one.  I said ... gee, my house is going to colapse on top of me.  I braced or tried to brace myself for this (thinking maybe an earthquake as the noise preceeding this reminded me of an earthquake when I lived in Japan) and expecting to hear furniture hitting each other as well as the west wall.  I mean the angle was about 45 degrees now.  However, I neither heard furniture slamming into anything and to my amazement, my ceiling fan was turning as normal and not at an angle.  That clued me into something weird.  All this time while I was trying to brace myself, but then I realized I was fully imobilized, could not move any limb or my head.  The only thing that would move were my eyes and they were open.  At this time, I forgot about the tilting effect when I looked to my right toward my skylight and see a beam of blue light that I sensed was searching and it found me.  To my left (west side) I also saw light coming from the window.  I realized somethign was not right, yet could not move let alone get up.  I now felt as if made semi unconcious yet fully awake and being examined in bed.  I looked around and could only make out a small dark figure to my left, above my head and to my right.  To my astonishment, directly in front and a little to the right of me about 10 ft away I saw what appeared to be a holograhic figure or what tried to be one, or perhaps that was the beam of light that found me.   I asked these thing what they wanted, but got no response and sensed they were intent on examining me.  I definately experienced fear! , yet no thing I could do.  Then suddenly it stopped, and they left at least it felt that way, and I look quickly at the clock and it was 0402 hours.  The blue light then gradually went away (maybe 30 seconds after the events stopped) from both my sky light and window.  I have been awake since.;27.4263646153846;-97.8412323076922
Strange light hovers outside of Kingsville;2005-11-02 19:30:00;30 min;Strange light hovers outside of Kingsville When driving south of Kingsville towards Ricardo we noticed a bright light in the southwestern sky. Initially we thought it was a planet, but there was a glow around it that wasnt shared by the stars visible in the shy near it.  We drove onto a back road for a better view and observed as the light moved from side to side and up and down, seemingly at random.  It also changed color several times as we watched.  It ranged from orange, red, blue, and green. The brightness of the light also varied during the time we watched.  It was always the brightest object ib the sky, but it seemed to periodically change in brightness, often emitting different colors of light in different directions. As we watched we noticed an abundance of aircraft from the nearby naval base flying towards or in the area.;27.4263646153846;-97.8412323076922
Two bright stars seen on a cloudy stormy day;2016-05-17 00:00:00;10 minutes;two bright stars seen on a cloudy stormy day It was about 8:00 p.m. Tuesday, May 17, 2016, in Kingsville, Texas.  A storm clouds had just passed Kingsville...there was no rain but still enough sunlight.  I looked up at the sky and noticed a bright light almost like a bright star!  I wondered how could I see a star when the sky was completely covered with dark clouds!  I looked around and also noticed another bright star around 1/2 mile from the first one.  I asked myself if it was a drone or what could these two shining objects be?  Where they under the clouds or above...it either case, the objects were like stars blinking on and off and not moving.  After 5 minutes, I contacted the Kingsville Police Department to send an officer to see what I was seeing.  The department was too busy to send someone.  I kept looing at both stars and noticed that one star had completely disappeared.  I kept looking at the other one left for about five minutes.  It was not moving.  I noticed that lighting was traveling from cloud to cloud on the west side, but I kept staring at the only star left.  All of a sudden, the star turned bright red and traveled to the direction of the lighting.  It moved so fast (without me hearing any sound) as a spacecraft as seem on television.  These two objects were not from earth, in my opinion. These stars to me were attracted to the lighting and one of them headed in the direction of the lighting.   I telephoned the Kingsville Naval Air Station this morning and spoke about what I saw.  That individual said that is was only an electrical event and nothing else.  I do not buy this theory!  I am very skeptical about life beyond earth, but after seeing what I sawâ€¦ I believe that there is life beyond earth! I am religious and spoke with some religious leaders about what I saw.  They informed me that it was a sign from God to me to ask Him what He wanted from me?  That what I see was only meant for me to see and no one else!  I do believe in God, but cannot accept from these religious leaders what they told me.  Since Tuesday, May 17, 20! 16, I will always believe that there are beings from space that are watching our earth.  What I have said is the truth and I will not recant what I have just said!;27.4263646153846;-97.8412323076922
