UFO String of lights in Hico Texas.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 05:35:00;3-5 minutes;UFO String of lights in Hico Texas I awoke at 5:30 this morning & went outside to smoke & saw something I can’t explain.  There was a string of lights slowly crossing the night sky. It was one light behind another in a line, possible 10-15 in a row.  I went into the yard & watched it until it was out of sight.  Living outside very rural Hico Texas, I’m able to see planes & even satellites, this was neither of them.  It was high in the sky but below a plane I saw crossing from west to east.  When I came back in, I did a search for UFO string of lights and was able to find a pic of what I saw. The pic was from a game camera in Archer City & was exactly what I saw.;31.9597;-98.0234
