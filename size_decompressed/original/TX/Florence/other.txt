Clover shaped UFO with Red lights spotted near Florence TX;2008-02-23 21:00:00;3 seconds;Clover shaped UFO with Red lights spotted near Florence TX I was driving on hwy 195 around 9 pm at night at 65 miles per hr. I was about 15 mins from Florence, TX when I saw a large spacecraft fly over head. It was flying low to the ground about as high as a low billboard. It made no sound. From underneath it was like a clover shape with three petals. It had intricate red lights on its underbelly which is how i was able to see the actual shape at night. This was very close so there was no mistake about what it was. I have seen all kinds of planes and jets because i grew up in Hampton Roads which is home to a number of military bases. I know what planes look like and sound like but this was truely not from here. I called the police department to make a report and the officer was shocked when I pointed out the aircraft made no sound so I felt like he knew this was very unusual.;30.8068;-97.7771
