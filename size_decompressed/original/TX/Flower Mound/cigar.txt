June 10, 2015, @ 4:50 am  Outside my apartment building, I saw a bright orange light coming from North East direction in the corner of my left vision and I quickly jumped out of my car and saw in front of me moving fast towards me at a 45 degree angle a cigar shape cylinder looking flying object with orange lights in front and in back of it.   Approximately 3 stories high in front of me, lower than any plane would fly.  Was jet-like speed.  Traveling at an angle to South West direction.  Smaller than a jet plane and bigger than an suv truck.  I heard no noise and saw no smoke.  I quickly followed the UFO craft by moving my body in the direction that it was traveling for approximately 7 seconds total and then all the orange lights and flying craft suddenly disappeared from my vision.  The back ground was trees and a dark sky and the UFO craft was clearly visable to me eye sight directly moving in front of me.  The Moon was waning to the south-east of me with very sma! ll amount of light in the sky.
