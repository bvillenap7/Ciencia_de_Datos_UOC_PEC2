huge flashing light formation moving slowly across the sky;2011-02-28 19:10:00;2.5 min;huge flashing light formation moving slowly across the sky Approximately 7:10 this evening, I was outside in my driveway looking up, noticing what a beautiful night it was.  From the corner of my eye, I noticed a flashing or blinking light, so I looked up in that direction and saw what appeared to be lights flashing at either end of a long straight line.  The lights were white. The flashing went from side to side and seemed to travel briefly the length of the rod before flashing from the other end and back.  The lights were small and the object had to be huge, as the distance between the lights was much longer than any wingspan of any plane I've seen flying around here.  It was silent and slow moving and I could see no shape of an object between or along the lights.  The object was tilted at a diagonal of about 45 degrees as it traveled away from me in a Northwest direction.  The angle increased a bit as it moved further away.
