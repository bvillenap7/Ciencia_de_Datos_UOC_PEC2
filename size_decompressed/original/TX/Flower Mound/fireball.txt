Fireball near DFW Airport on 7/23/07;2007-07-23 22:50:00;3 seconds;Fireball near DFW Airport on 7/23/07 I live 6 miles north of DFW airport.  I was looking back toward the airport into the southern sky. At approximately 10:50 PM, I saw a primarily blue fireball in the southern sky heading from east to west.    The fireball was larger than passing planes.  It was round with a green and white tail.  The fireball continued from east to west toward the ground.  The fireball diminished in size as it headed toward the ground until disappearing on the horizon.  This was not a plane.;33.035193006993;-97.0873447552447
