There were approximately 20 lights in a circular formation which came up very quickly. We ran west across our field to try to see what they were. I called my 19 year old son at 7:37 on my cell phone to come outside to see the formation. By the time he arrived outside, the lights had broken apart, and there were about 10 lights which then scattered moving west. We did not have a video camera or digital camera on us to take pictures. All I had was my cell phone. There were several aircraft circling for landing in the vicinity, as we live about 10 miles north of DFW airport. These lights were in the proximity of western Flower Mound.;33.035193006993;-97.0873447552447
Unknown lights hovering above store.;2009-07-27 03:30:00;35 seconds;Unknown lights hovering above store. I was working overnight at a gas station on the corner of a major intersection.  I was out in front of the store smoking when I notice three distinct lights hovering over the store across the street.  They were purple, green, and a bright white.  They formed a triangle over the store. I observed them for around 35 seconds and then they disappeared without a trace.;33.035193006993;-97.0873447552447
