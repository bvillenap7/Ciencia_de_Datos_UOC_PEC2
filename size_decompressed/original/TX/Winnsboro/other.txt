It was a diamond shaped craft with a half moon halo traveling along in front of it.  It had a long tail that was a little bit wider than the craft itself.  I saw the U.F.O outside of my window the window is facing south the craft was going east   I ran to the window and watched it for a very short period of time approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared .  I didnâ€™t take an approximate time but it was around midnight.    If it helps I am a trained national weather service weather spotter and have never seen anything like this before.;32.9174;-95.2737
