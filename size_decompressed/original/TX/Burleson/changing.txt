6 flickering  red/white lights linked together in a broken V, converged to form a Hexagon then flew away https://youtu.be/NgqCSPKCm2g;2019-01-23 22:48:00;15 minutes;6 flickering  red/white lights linked together in a broken V, converged to form a Hexagon then flew away:  https://youtu.be/NgqCSPKCm2g Driving down I-35w and Rendon Crowley Rd., next to Texas Health Huguley Hospital, I was on the phone with my girlfriend ((who was)) driving ahead of me, and we both witness strange red/white flashing lights in the sky a little in the distance, we drove parallel to these lights and it looked like they were linked in a chain together 3 lights majority stay red followed by one majority staying white, then 2 more majority red (still flickering the opposite color red to white or white to red).  They formed a broken V shape while spread out seemingly linked together somehow.  I wanted a better look so we exited the highway, turned around and then came into the view of the strange lights.  They were remaining still the first time we drove by them.   As we approached they seemed to form a hexagonal shape and started to glow the same color but would randomly flicker the opposite light individually (red to white).  As we got closer to the spot we first witness them, they drifted away furt! her and further ahead.  I recorded this video below.   Background: I don't have any UFO viewing experiences but have always wanted to see something out of the ordinary.  Absolutely love watching documentaries about UFO's.  I had some slight doubt at first.  Just so absolutely happy I was finally able to witness this wonderful event.  25 years old, white male, manage an electronic retail store.
