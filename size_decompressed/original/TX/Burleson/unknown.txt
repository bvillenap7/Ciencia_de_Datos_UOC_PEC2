strange lights in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Stars or planets??  PD));2008-11-06 19:15:00;about 20 min;strange lights in sky Father went out to smoke and called me out.  We saw two shapes to the west that at first looked liked stars.  Then we slowly witnessed them move.  One moved very very slowly.  One did not seem to move until a plane came near it.  Then almost as soon as the plane was a little bit away it dipped down very low then slowly dissapeared.  We watched the other slower moving one for a few more minutes.  It just seemed to hover.  Not sure what happened to it.  Had to come in. ((NUFORC Note:  Stars or planets??  PD));32.5310153846153;-97.3134316239311
