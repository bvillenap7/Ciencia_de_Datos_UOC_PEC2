It seemed to be moving much to quickly to be a plne, and the light did not blink or change in intensity, except to become more distinct as it came closer. As the traffic signal changed i drove through the intersection and began to look for a spot to pull over while still keeping the light in my feild of vision.   I noticed it began to arc, towards the rear of my vehicle and immediately pulled to the side of the road. the turn was not an abrupt change of direction, at first, but a very tight arc, and as I exited my car with phone in hand, the ball of light shot straight up, ascending until it was no longer visible so quikly I had to bink to regain focus and start searching the sky.  The people across the street were alarmed at my pulling over so quickly and after I asked what they had seen, as they were also searching the sky, they admitted that they hadn't seen anything but had heard a sound, like a whistling associated with something moving very fast, and were already looking for what had caused the sound. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent, and reliable, witness.
