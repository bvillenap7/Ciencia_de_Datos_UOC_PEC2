3 spheres seen flying south then disappear;2019-07-04 20:30:00;1 minute;3 spheres seen flying south then disappear I was driving west and as I looked to the moon I saw three spheres in a row to the left going south and after about 30 seconds of travel  they disappeared.  I waited to see if they may reappear but nothing followed.   The next day my sister saw what we believe to be the same crafts when she was riding her bike that evening.;32.5310153846153;-97.3134316239311
