light from sky came down in arc shape over horizon;2009-02-03 17:00:00;9 or more seconds;light from sky came down in arc shape over horizon I reported this occurrence a while back and just now looked to see if it was in your reports for February. I noticed the report date was there but no report.I am hoping you don't think it was a hoax. I am still stunned by the sighting. It was truly shocking to see!  Driving north on the service road of I35 toward Fort worth Texas at dusk after an ice storm, the northern sky was lighted from above in an arc shape to the ground covering a good portion of the sky.  It stayed that way for several seconds(it was lit up as soon as I turned on to the service road) and suddenly as if someone turned off a switch, it completely turned off.  The sky was then dark.  I know it was not lightening or anything like that.  It was so incredibly unusual that it really scared me.;32.5310153846153;-97.3134316239311
Enormous light covers northern horizon of Fort Worth Texas;2009-02-03 17:00:00;6-9 seconds;Enormous light covers northern horizon of Fort Worth Texas I had just had the vet out  to check on one of my horses late one afternoon about 4:00 after a brief ice storm in the area. The vet left about 5 and i stayed with the horse until about 5:45 or so.  I left the ranch and turned onto the service road of I 35 heading north. The clouds were dark but the sun was breaking trhough somewhat to the west,on my left. I noticed that it looked like the sun was also setting to the north as well!  The entire northern horizon was lit up in a pale violet blue light.  The light seemed to come down from the clouds and fan out over the horizon.  The city of Fort Worth, Texas was directly under the light.I looked at the light for several seconds and then to my astonishment it simply turned off!  The sky was entirely black in front of me!  I was so shocked I immediatley drove home and turned on the TV expecting to see something on the news about it, but nothing.I am a teacher and mentioned it to my 5th grade class the next day to see if anyone else in Fort Worth had seen it and one student who is fairly level headed told me she and her mother had seen it while driving and didn't know what it was either. I know it was not lightening or some kind of power surge as the light was coming from above. It really scared me and it still does because  it was huge!What ever it was it covered an entire section of the sky.
