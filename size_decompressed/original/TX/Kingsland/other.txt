Line of about 50 lights moving from north, northwest to south, southeast slowly.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-10-24 20:00:00;30 seconds;Line of about 50 lights moving from north, northwest to south, southeast slowly. Lights were in line, not blinking, and moving as if connected, not in formation. I moved into the yard with binoculars as it moved overhead and they faded out. I was calling out to my neighbor to look, but he was entertaining guests and didn't hear me. I'm on the south waterfront side of the Llano river arm of lake LBJ.;30.6667;-98.4419
