This evening, at 7:15 P.M., heading south bound on Hwy. 75, nearing exit 56, I saw what appeared to be a strange, low lying cloud.  It was above the tree lines and roughly 1/2 the size of an 18 wheeler.  The formation was moving east at a strange pace.   I then noticed it start moving south at a faster pace and then move upward. I slowed down to watch it.  It was at this time I saw the object lift upward again and then it vanished. I have a degree in science and I am a retired Earth science teacher.  I've never observed a cloud shaped like this one or move in this manner. It was disk shaped, domed roof, charcoal grey and was the consistency of a cloud. Airplanes flying into DFW were in the background in the same southeast direction.  I was using the movement and speed of the planes in the distance to compare the cloud/UFO.;33.6429860824742;-96.6141814432991
