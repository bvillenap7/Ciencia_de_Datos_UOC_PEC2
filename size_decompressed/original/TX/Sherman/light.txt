Bright Greenish in color object in Sherman / Denison area;2003-09-20 01:57:00;5 - 10 Seconds;Bright Greenish in color object in Sherman / Denison area I am a security officer at a local mall.  While on patrol of the exterior of the facility heading East across the facility parking lot, I noted a bright light out of the peripheral of my vision to the North and East of my location.  The light while in my peripheral vision appeared at first to me as a flair in its intensity but the unusual movement and speed is what caught my attention and I turned my head to face the source.  I observed a brief but bright greenish in color light, similar to what would be seen with an electrical arc.  There was a well defined width to the trail much larger than what would be seen in a meteorite and no deterioration of the object as it traversed the sky.  The object passed from my vantage from the South South-East to the North North-West starting at about a 60 degree angle in the direction I was looking in and covering a track to the horizon in which it disappeared.  The duration of the event took only a few seconds from the time I began to watch the event to the time which it disappeared from my sight.;33.6429860824742;-96.6141814432991
