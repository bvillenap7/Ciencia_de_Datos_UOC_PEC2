Sherman, TX. Police Officers and People in Neighborhood See UFO Flying Above Power Lines;2002-03-20 22:00:00;30 minutes, at least;Sherman, TX.   Police Officers and People in Neighborhood See UFO Flying Above Power Lines. (Please do not share my identity, email, etc. with anyone.) (I am unsure of exact date, time, and duration.)  My husband & I heard the following, on the police scanner we have. Officers from the Sherman Police Department (Sherman, TX.) were dispatched to a neighborhood, because their were sightings of something strange in the air. One officer said, Does this sound for real?  Someone (I think the dispatcher) said, That neighborhood is a very good neighborhood.  Those people wouldn't be calling if there wasn't something there.  (She said it was the (?something) HILLS addition. We heard the responses of the officers as they arrived.  They were VERY excited and a female officer said, My GOD !!!  What IS that thing.  I have never seen anything like this before in my life.  It's moving just above the power lines.  The officers were then talking back and forth (I guess to the dispatcher.)  Then, a man came on and said in a very quick, firm voice, Cease talking NOW!!!!!! Everything went quiet.  (We think they may have gone to a different frequency or something, so they couldn't be heard. (I am aware that many years ago, there were numerous sightings of UFOs in Sherman,TX. and surrounding areas.  The Perrin Field Air Force Base used to be in Sherman, TX.  This base trained 17 astronauts.  (Including Neil Armstrong, and many other well-known astronauts.) I cannot begin to tell you how excited those officers were when they saw whatever it was.  (I only wish I'd been there to see it for myself...I think.  I still wonder what it looked like.)  I wish you could get the story from those officers, and people living in that neighborhood.
