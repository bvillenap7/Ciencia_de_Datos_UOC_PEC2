While watching jets,saw sphere and video-taped;2003-11-24 16:30:00;20 secs;While watching jets,saw sphere and video-taped My grandson and I were watching jets make trails toward the west (Dallas)when we both saw a flash at about 11:00 oclock (nearly straight up).The trails made the sky hazy,but we both agreed the object was round and shiny.It didn't look like an airplane at all,but did have a very small contrail.The object was heading west at a similar speed of the jets.This was approximately 4:30 pm central time on 11-24-03.;32.5421;-96.2840999999999
