Large oval light, with smaller red light on top that was not blinking, in northern skies.;1998-10-26 03:23:00;35sec.;Large oval light, with smaller red light on top that was not blinking, in northern skies. Thinking it was an aircraft, or airplane, noticed that the light was not moving at all. Just sitting there. Light to large for aircraft light, and to bright. Red light on top, was somewhat smaller, but, not blinking at all. And within 25 or 30 seconds later, it was gone. Thinking it turned right or left, but, could not see any lights at all. And then thinking it may be an airplane and maybe went behind some clouds, but, there were no clouds. All stars. Clear morning. Wife noticed about 30 minutes later, in the south west skies, the same kind of lights, and then it disapeared in the same manner.;32.5421;-96.2840999999999
