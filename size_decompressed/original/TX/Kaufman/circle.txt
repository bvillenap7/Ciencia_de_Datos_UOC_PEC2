And the driver pointed it out first there were 3 circular orbs appearing to be stacked one above the other at a slight angle at first we thought they were helicopters but further observation we could see they were not in fact.  We traveled down the highway for about 5 minutes watching them.  I am not for sure what they were but i do know that they were not helicopters.   I am ex military so i have seen many helicopters and that is not what that was.  After we watched them for about 5 minutes we came to our exit and right before we got ready to exit they just disappeared.   Please someone tell me what we just witnessed.
