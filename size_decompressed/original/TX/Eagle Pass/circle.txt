It was sometime early this year, when me and my friend were driving back from visiting family in Eagle Pass, Tx.  I was driving east, about 30 miles away from eagle pass when, He goes, Hey, what's that up there, it's not a plane!?  I look, I'm driving but I clearly see it's not a normal object, it fixed in the sky like a black dot.  We pull over off from the highway, and we use a digital camera that's not for taking distant pictures, yet we're still able to catch the black dot in the sky, it takes time finding it in the picture but it is there, as we were leaving a smaller circular object could be seen underneath it.
