We look up and there is somewhat of a triangular (but the points were rounded) object,  hovering at times, then moving slowly overhead to the south of us.   First you couldn't see it, then one side of it lit up with a light that looked to vibrate and right after that light dimmed another light came on which looked like a camera flash.   I felt as though we were having our pictures taken.   Video to follow, if I can get my  hands on it.;28.7031000000001;-100.4785
