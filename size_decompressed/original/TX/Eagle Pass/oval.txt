Varias personas, sobretodo personas que viven al sur del Condado de Maverick han reportado haber visto luces extrañas en el cielo, durante las noches.  Un residente del sector Loma Linda dijo que junto con su familia la noche del martes 2 de agosto vieron 3 luces que se quedaban en el cielo y luego se movían rapidamente. Dijo que eran aproximadamente las 9 de la noche cuando vieron tres luces grandes que luego desaparecieron, pero tambien había muchas luces mas pequeñas. Comentó que tambien escucharon un gran ruido. El residente del sector Loma Linda dijo que esta seguro que esas luces no eran de ningun helicoptero, ni avión, se trata de objetos desconocidos. Desde hace varios días varias personas han reportado estar viendo estas luces. Dicen que se observan en las noches rumbo al Indio, Texas. Sin lugar a dudas se trata de OVNIS y algunas personas de Eagle Pass ya les han tomado fotografias con sus celulares. Hasta el momento no hay ninguna explicación a esto que esta sucediendo.
