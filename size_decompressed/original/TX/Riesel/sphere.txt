Screeching noise with bright light.;2010-03-09 03:00:00;5 minutes;Screeching noise with bright light. It was storming heavily all night long, I went outside to call a friend and smoke a cigarette. When I called we were talking for about 3 minutes and then I stated to here a screeching noise. Well, I figured living in the country that it was probably just a bird, such as an owl,  but then a light appeared.  The light was flickering, I assumed that it was a helicopter but then I remembered that it was storming pretty badly ten minutes prior to this.  After about 5 minutes, it disappeared.
