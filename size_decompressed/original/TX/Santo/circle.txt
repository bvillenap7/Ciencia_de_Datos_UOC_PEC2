I called a friend to come out and look.  She and I saw two more flashes of light that looked like a gigantic camera flash over the western sky, closer to the horizon this time.  It was a more yellowish color this time, more like the color of lightening, but there were no lines in it.  When I first saw this pink light, my first thought was the northern lights I have seen pictures of.  But the circular think was beyond anything I have ever seen.  This is the first odd thing I have ever seen in the sky.  I liver in a rural area.  This was not fireworks or lightening.;32.5988;-98.1752
Reappearing bright lights with alternating colors moving very slowly approximately 200 AGL.;2009-11-18 19:33:00;25min;Reappearing bright lights with alternating colors moving very slowly approximately 200 AGL. At approximately 19:33 2 miles west of Santo TX, I was in the process of feeding my dogs when I noticed out of the corner of eye a bright light.  I stopped to look and the bright light began to dim, then immediately a second light illuminated for one second, then a third for one second and then a fourth.  After the fourth illumination, I saw 4 tiny white dots moving very slowly across the sky and within a second or two all the lights disappeared.  They reappeared in almost the same area, in the same pattern and it happened again for a total of 3 cycles.  They were approximately 200ft AGL, 2 miles from our home.  The colors were a yellowish orange that seem to change colors and almost flicker.;32.5988;-98.1752
