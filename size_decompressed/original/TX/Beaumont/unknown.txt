It was a huge craft with several lights rotating on and off in a circle manner located under the craft.;1992-03-22 18:30:00;30 min;It was a huge craft with several lights rotating on and off in a circle manner located under the craft. I was driving home from work on Hwy 90  towards Houston.I was in between two small towns China, and Nome.It was about 6:30 pm. When I noticed something strange in the sky. At first, I thought it was an Blimp with an advertisement.Then I noticed there were no advertisements, but it was a huge looking craft. It had different colored flashing lights blinking on and off. The lights seemed to be in a circular arrangement under the craft. I found myself drawn to it and kept thinking I was going to drive close to it. I cannot believe, that I kept driving towards it, without fear.There were several cars on the highway heading the same directions. No one stopped, or turned around. The craft was further from me than I thought. I thought the craft was located on the corner of Hwy 90 and Hwy 326. But when I got to that intersection it was further ahead. The craft was to the right of the highway, and I am guessing it was about 100-250 feet hovering above the ground. I am not exactly sure what date, or month. It was in 1992, between January and October of that year.The shape is hard to describe.I am curious if anyone else reported a sighting around this time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Huge smoke trail in upper atmosphere. Cought on film.;1999-01-15 16:00:00;15mins;Huge smoke trail in upper atmosphere. Cought on film. I am not the wittness to this but did however see the film on our local news broadcast.Im not sure of the date at all but it has not been moe than a year.My concern is that this sighting is dead meaning the woman who filmed it in broad daylight gave it to the local news station and never reported it to any investigater.To me this sighting was very significant.The short piece of footage they showed on the news was a huge ball of steaming smoke that was just rolling off of something big coming in to the atmosphere.The news stations to contact would be either channel 6 or 12 in Beaumont Texas.Please contact me for any questions at ((address deleted))   Thanks;30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678
Shiny object flying a rectangular grid pattern along the path of Highway 90 in Beaumont, Texas;2000-08-15 17:00:00;15 to 20 minutes;Shiny object flying a rectangular grid pattern along the path of Highway 90 in Beaumont, Texas 	Hello, I will keep this short. I have not said anything publicly for almost 40 years but with the wealth of information you have I thought it might prove useful, perhaps to corroborate some other sightings. I am sorry I cannot give you a date. It has been too long. The way it acted might prove useful. I filled in a date on the form so it would go through but it was 1969 to 1971 in Beaumont, Texas.  It was Summer and in the afternoon, I think it was a Sunday but I am not sure. It was clear and sunny. I was on interstate 10 heading west, which is actually south on this section of the highway in Beaumont. The sighting was to my right or towards the west. This is what occurred. 	I saw a shiny object darting in the sky. It was so unique I pulled onto the side of the road as the road rose over Highway 90. To my left was Gateway Shopping center. I pulled up behind two or three other cars that had also pulled over to watch. Another car pulled over behind me. We all got out and stood watching. The object flew between points very rapidly (I mean almost instantly) and then hovered. It flew in a square or rectangular pattern moving out Highway 90 toward Houston. It overlapped itself and worked farther and farther away. If I had to guess, I would say it was coming back about half way each time it made the return leg on my left. Anyway, it moved much farther away on my right than it returned on my left. My first thought was that it was mapping or surveying. It flew this pattern until it simply was too far away to see anymore. It took a long time. It is hard to say because I did not time it but it must have been ten or twenty minutes before it was too far away to see. 	It stopped at each corner for only ten or fifteen seconds, as it flew the grid centered over Highway 90, so each square took one minute or less. It flew 15 or twenty of these that were visible after I stopped. It was impossible to tell how high, how far away or how large it was. There was absolutely no scale to work with. 	It was not like a light. It was the sun reflecting off something but I cannot say what shape it was. I doubt that it was long unless pointing away from me. The light was concentrated instead of spread out. 	We watched together without speaking, at least not from one group to the other, and when it was over, we shrugged at each other, got in our cars and drove away. I hope this is useful. Once you have seen one, you wonder why everyone tries so hard to deny them. We still do not have anything that can do what this craft did and it did not seem to be a threat. 	You asked for info on me. I am 54, owned a supply company for over twenty years and I am now a full time college student. I am an Environmental Science major at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas and I think I was a student at Lamar when this sighting occurred (Either that or a senior in high school). I have a fairly high IQ and no reason to fake this. There is nothing to gain from this. 	It would be nice to find out if others reported something similar. I have never seen or heard of anything similar. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678
