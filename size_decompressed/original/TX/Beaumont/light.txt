Bright light (Venus-like), green, red and white, stationary for 2+ hours.;2002-07-25 02:00:00;2 hours;Bright light (Venus-like), green, red and white, stationary for 2+ hours. I work nights at an isolated tank farm.  I had to go out at 2:00 a.m. to check equipment.  I noticed a very bright light where Venus had risen earlier in the evening.  I thought perhaps it was a binary star, since it looked like a double star as bright or brighter than Venus with my naked eye,  and went back and consulted the Heavens-Above website, which I look at on a regular basis since I work at night a lot and like to observe different satellites, shuttle, space station, etc. flying overhead. The sky chart for 2 a.m. showed no bright stars at that time in that location.  I know that I had never seen a satellite after approximately 10:00 p.m. local time and sure enough there were none on the list.  Also, this object did not move.  I got my binoculars out and then I observed the object having 3 distinct lights, green, white and red, which makes me think it was probably some unnamed stationary satellite.  It was in the same area for 2 hours.  At approximately 4 a.m. it was no longer visible.  I WAS a skeptic about UFOs until then.  I did observe the space station flying over the next evening, however, it crosses the sky in about 4 -5 minutes and is gone.  Venus sets about 9 p.m. local time. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a celestial body may, in fact, be the cause of the sighting, although the witness appears to have experience in viewing the night sky.  The colors described are indicative of a twinkling star.  Also, given the length of time the object was visible, we strongly suspect it was not a bona fide UFO.  Satellites do not appear to hover in the night sky.  PD));30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678
Exploding, traveling light that traveled far faster and more sparatically than any craft I've seen.;2004-08-27 21:00:00;10 minutes;Exploding, traveling light that traveled far faster and more sparatically than any craft I've seen. My family and I were driving toward Winnie, TX, around 9 p.m. in the evening on the 27th of August, so as to goto the beach for the weekend. We were driving on the interstate a bit after the sun had already set, and I was leaning my head on the backseat passenger window just gazing out into the sky. My father was driving, and my mother was in the front passenger seat. I soon noticed a tiny white light traveling in a sparatically upward pattern. I dismissed it as a plane, but soon realized that the craft was changing direction far too much to be any kind of passenger jet. I followed it silently as it changed direction instantly several times, trying to keep focused on it. I soon told my mother, and she noticed the craft too. We were both astonished by its irregular motion, and it soon dissapeared into the distance, as if it had suddenly shot away from us, instantaneously. But, seconds later, it re-appeared, the light was still at the same opacity, but it had re-appeared in a location far from where it had disappeared. We were both a little frightened by the reality of the situation, but it didn't cause us to jump to conclusions or anything else of that sort. We were still on the interstate, and we had told my father of the craft, but he was busy driving and was not able to get a look. My mother and I followed the craft as it seemed to stop dead in the sky. No longer than it had been motionless, it began to give off what seemed tiny little explosions. It looked like the craft was kind of popping bright shimmering fireworks. It looked much like very dim artillery shell-style fireworks blowing up right off of the craft itself. We watched this happen several times, 8-10 times. We could even see would seemed like the little embers from these explosions floating downward toward the ground. The craft continued to kind of spontaneously combust, and eventually began moving once again in its sparatic movement. We watched it move across the sky and eventually dissapear once again, all the while it was still exploding like a faint artillery shell. It eventually left our sight.;30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678

Who Knows, Could It be EBE ? I dont know...Glad to share.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678
I was standing outside with my sister-in-law walking my dog when I noticed the strangest star in the sky.;2018-10-14 01:00:00;10 minutes;I was standing outside with my sister-in-law walking my dog when I noticed the strangest star in the sky.  It seemed to slightly morph shapes and it was slowly dimming or moving away from earth.  It them seemed to reappear and vanished behind a small field of trees near my house.  I tried to go investigate but my dog wouldn't let me drag him.  My sister in law ran in the house when she saw how the dog and I were reacting.  He locked his paws to the ground in terror and i was just frozen.  More strange, when i returned in the house to put the dog up,it seemed that 3 hrs had somehow gone by.  Had i really been frozen that long?.  2 weeks later i had a horrible nightmare that 2 human-like creatures came out from that field of trees and entered my backyard setting off motion lights, only to have me rush outside to chase them away.  Except they didnt run. In the dream, as soon as i stepped outsdie, EVERYTHING FROZE.  The beings walked to me and knocked me down ending the dream.  I woke up finding that i had been sleep for over 24 hrs.I WILL NEVRR FORGET THOSE BEINGS OR THE SOUND I HEARD AS THEY NEARED ME IN THE DREAM.;30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678

I've seen this before.  The first time was approximately 2 months ago (10/14).  That time i heard a noise and my dogs went insane as the light seemed to disappear behind a small field of trees.  My dog definitely felt something.  Also when I got back in the house, it appeared that i lost track of time as 3 hrs had passed.  As though i spent 3 hrs looking at that object.  I recorded it.  And im wondering.  What did i see??;30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678
Light pollution normally creates adverse sky viewing even if it’s a clear night and no moon. ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-02 21:05:00;10 minutes;We live in town, Beaumont TX so light pollution normally creates adverse sky viewing even if it’s a clear night and no moon. I was in are back yard at about 9PM moving a bicycle back to our storage room off the garage. It’s a nice dark spot and looking up I noticed I could see the stars really well and the moon was also almost directly overhead.  So looking up at the moon and also scanning the western sky just for the heck of it-  I happened to see what I at first thought was a passenger plane.  I watched it for a second and thought it was interesting because I could not distinguish any flashing from the aviation lights.  It also seemed to be travelling about double speed from a standard plane at cruising altitude.  Even with that I just kept looking around at the stars and didn’t really think anything was that abnormal.  Then, I noticed another one following the first light – in the exact same path and exact same speed.  There was a good distance between them.  At this point I had been staring up approximately 30 seconds. By the time the first light went out of view to my left (behind some large ! trees in our yard) I could see a third light coming into view from my right.  Same path- same speed- same distance apart- same light brightness (about the same brightness as a medium star).  So in my viewing field of the sky, I could see 3 of these lights at one time…..like a train here came two more and decided to run in the house to get the wife .  She came out and was able to see the last 3 as the came by.  The last one we watched as it was almost out of view to our left, my wife said it just vanished.  I myself did not see it go out as I was looking to see if there were more coming.  I could have sworn I saw a steak of light from that direction also.  It was a super calm night – no jet noise could be heard.   Maybe satellites?  I don’t really think so, never seen any in train formation like that before.;30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678
