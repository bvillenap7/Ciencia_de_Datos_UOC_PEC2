waiting for crane at chemical plant late  afternoon object left no vapor trail every other  air craft in area left one;2004-03-06 17:45:00;05 minutes;waiting for crane at chemical plant late  afternoon object left no vapor trail every other  air craft in area left one Qbject was moving from east to west at a moderate speed(comparable to a piston aircraft)I did not see any wings and what first made me notice it was that although it was at approximately the same height as other aircraft in the area , the object left no vapor trail(contrails)it was ,from my vantage point,somewhat round in shape and dark brown to almost a copper color.What you must know is that I was looking at this object thru yellow tinted safety glasses so the color may be off,but it was easier to observe with the safty glasses on.I am an Ironworker working a shutdown in Beaumont Texas, we are always looking up.;30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678
