As a police officer at the time I was on a stake out when I observed a brilliant star on the far horizan. I took my eyes off the star and resumed surveilance of a parking lot. A few minutes later I went back to the star only to find it high in the sky. I then observed it decend in a slight arch back to its original location. I called another officer to my location and he and I sat there and watched as the object got closer and actually came close enough so that we could see the pilot in the cockpit and the instrument lights reflecting off of his helment and visor.The craft had a huge light on the front (about 20 ft. in diameter) but, there was no light emitted from it. I would describe it as more (DIAMOND LIKE) and that is what we mistook for a bright twinkling star. The Pilot was deffinatly humanoid and when he observed us observing him, he put the craft in hyperspeed and left the area in an instant without any sound at all.  I was never allowed to submitt an official report on the incedent and a check of the locall airport indecated nothing on radar at that time.;30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678
