I sit on my patio and wait for him and if it clear I look at the stars.  I am a very frequent flyer on Continental and know what planes look like at night.   I rushed for the video camera and of course not charged and no tape.  The flashing dot completed circled this one star to the left then if I were not scared enough directly to the right I saw the same event around another star.   I watched going in and out of my home to see if I had enough charge to record the event as it was still happening and I would just add to and old tape.  The object to the left got extremely bright and when this flashing dot was at the left side of the left star - it shot off to the left got very bright and almost looked like a falling star moving in a downward path almost the angle of a left side of a pyramid but was moving so incredibly fast.   At that point, I used a couple of choice words holy shxx to be exact and went inside and locked my door.  Called while the event was occurring.;30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678
