Black Triangle UFO with 3 White Lights on Each Point Seen in Beaumont, TX;2006-10-13 20:50:00;10-20 sec;Black Triangle UFO with 3 White Lights on Each Point Seen in Beaumont, TX I was waiting in my car to pick up a friend in a parking lot of an apartment complex located off Hwy 69 near the I-10 junction in Beaumont, Texas.  It was a clear night and I was enjoying the cool weather and had both windows and my sunroof open.  I was with someone else, but they had just exited the car for a moment.   I was just looking around, not paying much attention to anything, when what I thought was a low-flying aircraft caught my eye through the open sunroof.  I looked up, and saw what looked like a low-flying equilateral black triangle with bright white lights on each point traveling along at a moderately fast pace directly above me.  It wasn't going too fast for me to be able to follow it, but at the same time, it was gliding very smoothly and much too quickly for the altitude it looked like it was at.   As soon as I saw it, I got chills.  I knew it was not normal.   I followed its path, which was an estimated northeast to southwest direction until it seemed to either fade away or just go too far away for me to see it (although that did not seem possible because of the clearness of the night).  It made absolutely no noise that was audible to me.   I almost told my friend when they came back, because I was pretty shaken up, but I thought better of it.  I came home, did some internet research, and was amazed to find out about the Black Triangle phenomenon.  I had no prior knowledge of this. I must add that I was completely sober and relaxed, and UFOs were the last thing on my mind at that time.  I believe what I saw was 100% real.  It's definately made a believer out of me.  I'd like to know if anyone else from my area has seen similar things.;30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678

3 white lights flashing in sequence over Beaumont, Texas;2012-01-26 22:15:00;about 2 minutes;3 white lights flashing in sequence over Beaumont, Texas My husband and I had just finished eating at a restaurant in Beaumont, Texas.  It was about 10:00 PM, Central time.  On the way out to the car, in the parking lot, I looked up and saw what I thought was an airplane. I kept watching it, and I realized that it didn't have the same type of lights as an airplane does.  The lights were white, unlike airplane lights that are green, red, and white, and they were flashing in sequence. There was no noise such as you hear when a jet flies overhead.  The object was silent or nearly silent. The object appeared to be triangular, but it was very hard to tell, since it was dark outside at the time.  I didn’t see any real outline of the object, again probably because it was so dark.  It took a straight path over my head and over the restaurant. I took a video (I take my camera everywhere), but it was extremely difficult to keep the camera stable without a tripod.  I’m always aggravated with UFO videos that are taken by a camera operator with a shaky hand, but now I realize just how hard it is to keep a moving object in the shot while also trying to watch it yourself. I was very excited, because I'd never seen anything like this before.  Eventually the object just flew too far to keep track of.  I still don't know what it was, but I'd certainly like to.  It would be fantastic if someone has the proper equipment to stabilize this clip and/or do some sort of analysis.  As it is, you can't tell much at all.  Also, I'm sorry for the language at the end.;30.0893645979487;-94.1396997301678
