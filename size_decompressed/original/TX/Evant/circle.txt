Bright Orange Lights on Huge Disk-like Object Seen From South of Stephenville, TX on 10/23/08;2008-10-23 20:30:00;:30;Bright Orange Lights on Huge Disk-like Object Seen From South of Stephenville, TX on 10/23/08 I live outside the small town of Evant on a ranch, about 60-70 miles south of Stephenville. Myself, the ranch owner and his wife saw strange lights/object on Thursday night (10/23/08) from the ranch between 8:30 and 9:00 PM in what appeared to be mainly over the Stephenville area, although the first time I saw the lights/object it was far west of us. The lights/object appeared five times over the thirty minute period. The lights were very bright orange in color, large and appeared to be rotating along a very large edge of a disk-like object. The ranch owner commented at the time that he could see or make out the curvature shape of the object, stating that it looked like a huge 'saucer'. When the object was in the Stephenville area (direction), we could clearly see the blinking lights of aircraft surrounding or chasing the object. We assumed these were military craft. We also heard what sounded like a sonic boom after the lights/object disappeared at one point, but it was far away and fairly faint. It may or may not be related to the lights/object we saw. After the lights/object left the Stephenville area around 9:00 PM, all the aircraft in the area left also.;31.4425;-98.0535
