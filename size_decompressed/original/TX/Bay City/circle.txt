Four red, non-strobing lights, slowly moving across night sky.;2015-12-31 20:15:00;5 minutes;Four red, non-strobing lights, slowly moving across night sky. Saw the first one slowly moving across the sky and the disappeared into the low cloud coverage and the three more appeared in a line formation slowly moving and then eventually disappeared like the first one.  They were red in color not changing just slowly moving.   We have low cloud coverage this night and I believe that's why they just seem to disappear.
