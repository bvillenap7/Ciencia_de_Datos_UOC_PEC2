UFO SIGHTED AT MATAGORDA  TX;2006-09-22 00:00:00;25 MIN;UFO SIGHTED AT MATAGORDA  TX I WAS AT THE MOUTH OF THE COLORADO RIVER AT MATAGORDA BEACH MY GIRLFRIEND AND I SAW A THREE LIGHT TRIANGLE U.F.O. BOBBING AN JUMPING AROUND LIKE A KITE WOULD. THE TOP LIGHT STAYED LUMINATED BUT THE TWO BLUE LIGHTS UNDER IT BLINKED ON AND OF IN A STRANGE SEQUENCE ABOUT 200 FT ABOVE THE RIVER AND ABOUT 100 YRDS UP RIVER TO OUR RIGHT.  WE WALKED TOWARDS THE U.F.O. TO GET A BETTER LOOK AT IT.  WE GOT RITE UNDER IT ON THE BANK OF THE RIVER AND WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 10 MINS THEN IT TURNED RED AND DROPED TO ABOUT 40' OFF THE WATER AND SHOT OFF IN A NORTHWEST DIRECTION FASTER THAN ANY THING I HAVE EVER SEEN THER WAS NO NOISE DURING THE WHOLE ENCOUNTER ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate time of event.

Sightings of object in Bay City, Texas;2007-12-28 19:00:00;10-15 minutes;Sightings of object in Bay City, Texas We were at our deer camp and we heard a noise and I just said that it was a jet. But it was loud.  My husband went outside and said come here and look. It was way lower than an airplane would fly, but dark where we could only see the lights, Was very very wide. It moved kind of slow.  The next day we tried to call the B.C. Airport to see what it might have been or if they knew anything about it.  No one answered.  So we blew it off.  Now that everyone is seeing things like what we have seen sort of, I decided to inform you.  I don't think it is a UFO, I seem to think this is a govenment thing.  I guess we will never know.  The lights were white.  We have been puzzled ever since and wondering.   We left alone, because we did not want people to think we were crazy...;28.8669777777778;-95.918725
