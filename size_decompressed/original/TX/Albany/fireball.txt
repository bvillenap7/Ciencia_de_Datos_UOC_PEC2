Big  blue and red fireball.;2008-04-22 22:30:00;20 seconds;Big  blue and red fireball. I was driving home from Abilene, Texas to my home in Albany, when all of a sudden there was a flash of white/blue light and a huge fireball way to close to be a shooting star began plummeting to the ground. The fireball thing had a tail and a reddish tint on the underside of it. It disappeared almost as fast as it had appeared, and I immediately called my mom and dad who were coming from Moran, Texas on a parallel highway. They weird thing is, is that they saw the exact same thing I did and they had no idea what it was either.;32.7229;-99.3187
