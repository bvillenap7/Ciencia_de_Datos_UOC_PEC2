Triangle object no lights no sound;1984-05-21 21:30:00;10 seconds;Triangle object no lights no sound I just saw the ABC speicial and had goosebumps.  Approx 1984-85 I was living in Longview,Texas..in town in a residental area. It was a clear night and I had went outside comming out of the garage into the driveway facing east.  I looked up and saw a large Triangle shaped object fly directly overhead at a low altitude (500 -1000 Feet?}. It's flight path was aprox south-west. There where no lights but I could clearly see the outline of the craft against the night sky.  There was no engine noise at all but I could hear the craft push the through the air, almost like a glider. This was no glider..It was flying under power. I had only told two people this. Then tonight (2-24-05} when the ABC special was comming on I told my 9 year old daughter what happened. Then I saw on the special about the triangle crafts that made no sound..WOW. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));32.5315701923077;-94.7668961538461
Rain Cloud in Northeast Texas;2006-08-05 22:00:00;20 minutes;Rain Cloud in Northeast Texas On Saturday August 5, 2006 around 10 p.m., a coworker and myself observed three circular lights in the Northern sky in Gregg county Texas.  Earlier in the evening on this date, a large dark rain “cloud” had moved in from the west, moving northeast and was positioned in the Northern sky.  Within this rain “cloud”, which looked to be several thousand feet in the sky, and maybe several thousand feet in area, my coworker and I saw what appeared to be three white lights which appeared to be just skimming the underside of the cloud formation turning in a clockwise direction.  What I mean by skimming is how I think a light source would be observed just inside the bottom of a cloud formation without exposing itself to anyone from the ground.  They were more like seeing a light source in a fog or haze if you can imagen a view like this.  They were white and dim in places and brighter in other places as they were traveling closer and further away from our angle of view. The three lights were in a triangular pattern circling and synchronized with each other, meeting in the middle of the triangle formation moving in a clockwise direction.  Imagen three circles in a triangular pattern with rings touching each other and you can get an idea of these lights.  My coworker and myself watched these three lights for about twenty minutes before we decided to get back to work to finish up the night shift, which ended at eleven thirty. During this time while we were both looking at this event we were also scanning the horizon trying to find any kind of light source such as spot lights or other lights coming from the ground in this area which could have been projecting these lights from the ground. We were unable to observe any ground effect lights which could have been causing these lights.  Of course this cloud could have been smaller or larger than described.  There was nothing really to reference this cloud’s actual size that we could see in this area to give us a true indication of its size, but from past experience observing storm clouds and rain clouds like this it appeared to be very large in area as well as height.;32.5315701923077;-94.7668961538461

4 triangular shapes flying single file in military precision;2012-06-21 02:00:00;5 minutes;4 triangular shapes flying single file in military precision Four triangular objects the size of B52 or large commercial jets flying low over the city in an easterly direction.  Each object had 3 red lights and one bright white light. If an airplane shape, the red lights appeared on each wingtip and the nose.  The white light appeared in the middle equidistant between the wingtip lights and behind the nose light.  There were objects what appeared to be the shape and size of a commercial jet but they were flying single file very close together in military precision.  Large commercial planes do not fly that low, that close, or without some engine sound.   I have never seen a plane with that lighting configuration.  The formation flew over the town west to east roughly parallel to I20. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax.  Individual indicated as source of report claims he never submitted it.  Date is not indicated, so we have assigned an arbitrary date.  PD));32.5315701923077;-94.7668961538461

As soon as I sat down in my longue chair, I looked up and thought a saw a triangular light very high in the sky. It was way above the clouds but looked very large.  I looked away and rubbed my eyes and looked up again and the three lights remained. As a scale, I’m going to say there were about a 1/4” between each separate light. I got up and went inside to get my 24 year old son.  I asked him to look up and tell me what he saw.  He said a triangle. While observing it, it appeared to split and became two separate triangles. The first one stayed where it was while the second traveled to the south west. We lost sight of the second one as clouds got in the way. But the first one remained there for another 20 minutes.  It was there when I went back inside.  When I went back outside about 30 minutes later and it was gone. I plan on checking again tonight. I heard there were also sightings in Dallas, Texas, Lawton, Ok., and Mississippi, yesterday and last night.  Just FYI.;32.5315701923077;-94.7668961538461
