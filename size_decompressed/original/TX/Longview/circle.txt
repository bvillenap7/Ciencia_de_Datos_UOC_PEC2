Saw two hovering objects in the sky that had different colored lights on them.;1999-01-04 20:00:00;2-3 hrs;Saw two hovering objects in the sky that had different colored lights on them. At about 8:00p.m. on Mon. Jan. 4, 1999, my husband and I were returning home from the grocery store.  Just as we were about to pull into the driveway, I asked him to stop and look at a star that seemed to be flashing.  Once he had stopped the car, we could tell that the object wasn't flashing, but were lights that were changing colors.  We got our binoculars (we had just sold our telescope), and could see a circular object with four different lights on it: blue, green, red, and either orange or yellow.  Thinking that our friends may have a telescope, we called them to say we were coming over.  On our way over, my husband asked me to keep my eye on the objects, and that is when I noticed another one.  It was the same distance up in the sky, but seemed to be farther away because it was not as brilliant.  They were probably a mile or two apart.  When we got to our friend's house they came outside to look and saw exactly the same thing.  The brightest of the objects was slightly below the little dipper and lined up with one side of it.  The objects were not flying, but maybe hovering.  It was hard to tell because of the distance.  We all watched them for a while and went inside because it was cold.  We checked on them periodically throughout the night and they never moved, even though the little dipper did because of the Earth's rotation.  The next morning, Icould faintly see one of them, but it was much harder to see the lights because of the sunlight.  Later that afternoon, they were both gone.  The witnesses included myself, a college student on the Dean's List, my husband, a drafting instructor at a college, and our friend's who are a housewife and a computer programmer.  I also noticed a plane (not a commercial jet) fly very close to the brightest object about 30 minutes after I first spotted it.;32.5315701923077;-94.7668961538461
Daylight observation of a fast moving bright circular object below a 10,000 ft cloud level.;2003-07-08 16:41:00;3 Seconds;Daylight observation of a fast moving bright circular object below a 10,000 ft cloud level. Driving home from work southbound.  Lots of cumulus clouds.  Cloud bases about 10,000ft.  Visibility unlimited.  About 35 degrees above the southwest horizon a flash caught my eye.  Size: 1/4 circle at arms length.  Shape: Circle. Color: A very bright silver.  At first I thought it was a high flying airliner reflection until it moved / flipped under the dark base of a cumulus cloud.  It got brighter and a little larger then disappeared.  This was a distinct circular object. Not a reflection, not a balloon, not a bird, not a conventional aircraft.  I know aircraft, I was an Air Traffic Controller for 11 years.  The outstanding characteristics of the object was that it was a perfect circle and the color was a very bright liquid silver. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means a time of 16:41 hrs..  We have amended the time above.  PD));32.5315701923077;-94.7668961538461
Bright object suddenly gone;2009-07-18 23:00:00;less than 5 minutes;Bright object suddenly gone The object was very bright.  We observed it with binoculars.  It was much brighter than any star in the sky.  It wound bounce around and the light would get dim and then bright again.  Then it suddenly dissapeared.  The lights appeared yellow and orange.;32.5315701923077;-94.7668961538461
