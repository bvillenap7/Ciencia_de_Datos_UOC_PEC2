I am a local truck driver who isn't sure if ufos are real but i will tell you what i saw and let you decide. One nite while hooking up to a trailer at a large chemical factory I saw a large group of lites passing over head. THe lites were flying very close to each other. I thought it was a low flying jetliner with it's landing gear open which would be very unusal for around here. After the lites passed over head all of them changed to a flying Vee formation that is when I knew that all those lites were seperate objects. Also there wasn't any sound. Even with all the noise in the plant there sould have been some sound.;32.5315701923077;-94.7668961538461

I went outside at the time reported for the passover, and as scheduled I saw the space station.  I believe the time was 9:18 p.m.  As I watched the station pass over my location from northwest to southeast, I saw another object that was travelling parallel to the station, but at a minimum of twice the speed of the station.  It may have been a meteor or a satellite, but it did not fade out as most meteors do.  The object was luminous and continued to the horizon until it disappeared from my view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in May 2009  is approximate.  PD));32.5315701923077;-94.7668961538461
