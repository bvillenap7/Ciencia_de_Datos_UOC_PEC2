Sighting of Summer 1975 in Longview, Texas;1975-06-01 23:00:00;30 minutes;Sighting of Summer 1975 in Longview, Texas In the summer of 1975 was returning from a double date from taking one of my friends home we had to cross the Sabine River Bridge to go towards taking myself home as we were crossing the bridge I glanced down at the river and there hovering over the top of the river was a disc shaped object it was spinning at a very fast rate and I could see green-bluish light coming from it as it turned around and around. We decided we would try to get a closer look at it by going down a side road the next thing I remember is driving down Eastman Road at about 75mph and this thing passed us up followed us all the way from the river to the deadend street where I now live. It5 went out into the sky hovering  over the field. I ran inside and got my mother to come out to see it and she said there is nothing there but a star. It had stopped spinning when she came out but all of a sudden took off at an angle at a rapid rate and shot across the sky. We ran inside to call the airport to see if anything strange showed up on radar they did not believe us when we told them what we had seen thought we had been drinking or something. There was no sound coming from the craft at all but had a haze about it looked like somekind of sparks coming from the water with the craft hovering over it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
