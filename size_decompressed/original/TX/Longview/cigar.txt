Not up to the sky.I saw two very large red lights through a grove of trees on my neighbor's property. The lights were in a straight line and were moving in my direction, still behind the grove of trees. Then they began moving to my left,came out from the trees, and when I saw the front of the craft, I thought it was a blimp, because of the shape.It kept moving to my left very slow, passing behind another grove of trees,just above tree top level.The lights were blinking,and it made a slow easy turn to the northwest, and dissappeared due to the trees.It was less than 150 yards away, it was very, very large. An aura, faint, dull white color,and appeared to have windows,and DID NOT make a sound. It was around 18:00 cst. on 01/15/00 (dusk). I walked through the garage to the back door that leads to my patio. I walked out and stood on the edge of the slab, just glancing around.These two large red lights had appeared through a grove of trees on my neighbors property that butts up to mine. The lights were in a straight line atop the craft, but very apart, and they appeared to be moving toward me (south),then they began to move to my left (west). The nose of the craft                                                        broke from behind the grove of trees, and by the shape of it, I thought it was a blimp. Both red lights were on, with a slow blinking. I ran to the door and called the other two witnesses.We were standing in the back yard. It was moving very slow, no sound, very large,(long). It had an aura that was fuzzy, a dull light color that blended in with the early evening. There appeared to be the outlines of two or three rows of windows that were a shade darker than the body of the craft. It was very low but, above the trees.It was about 100 yards or more away, VERY CLOSE! It was still moving west, and then started veering (slowly) to the NNW. And the trees then obstructed our view, and it was gone. The witnesses: I am a 38yr old male, no drugs, have held the same job for 20yrs and single, and considered Middle Class on the pay scale. The other two witnesses are single and have been friends of mine for 20 years. One is an assistant mgr the other is a do every thing office worker. Neither do drugs.We are all very responsible, and family oriented, and have a ton of friends. We did not contact the local authorities, and as far as I know, no one else in my neibhorhood observed the craft, an that disturbs us. Please! Someone call us for questioning, we know we saw something that very few see.;32.5315701923077;-94.7668961538461
