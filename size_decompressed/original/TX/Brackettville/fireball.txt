large orange ball with green tail turning into an orange tail;2004-09-05 22:30:00;2 seconds;large orange ball with green tail turning into an orange tail We were in Kinney County,TX going into our ranch, this area is very densily populated..We were looking southerly towards Mexico when we saw a large orange ball shoot across the sky...this ball had a green tail that turned into an orange tail...it was almost as if it was a shooting star but it was alot larger.  Could this have been a meteor?....we had no clue.   FYI, Laughlin Air Force Base is in the vicinity.  If you know what this was can you let me know via email or phone.;29.3079;-100.4191
