Three hovering, glowing orbs observed in sequence.;2020-04-12 21:30:00;15 minutes;Three hovering, glowing orbs observed in sequence. We observed three separate glowing orbs just after sunset. The lights all appeared at different times but originated from slightly different places and headed different directions. They were all seemingly spherical, yellow to red colored lights hovering at low altitudes, and varying speeds. It was very difficult to assess the speed or distance of the lights since they were not sharply defined and were moving at different vectors, behind buildings, and trees, but they were within a mile or two of us. The lights were all completely silent. The first two lights moved from South-East to North-West, stopping to hover for a few seconds, and then smoothly disappearing into the distance. We saw one, and then the other almost immediately after. We were very surprised by the first two lights and didn’t know what to make of the way they were maneuvering and how close and silent they were. The third light however was different because it seemed to just appear, was much ! larger, and brighter than the first two. It also originated from the South-East and moved North-West before hovering and heading North-East and flying out of sight very quickly. We live near an Air Force base and are very familiar with all the various jets, training planes and helicopters that take-off, flyover and land. These were not any of those things, and we can’t be sure that it was anything more than a light since there was no defining shape, navigation lights, silhouette, or sounds other than the bright glowing lights themselves. We recorded a few moments of the last two lights on both of our phones and can clearly see them tracking smoothly across the sky, but it is difficult to focus on them or get any detail.;29.5477;-98.2951
