Gold fast light;2020-06-04 02:00:00;3 minutes;Gold fast light I was walking home from the gas station around 2:30am and I saw a bright gold sphere. It shot straight up into the stars, zigzagged around the Orion's belt, then shot up further and disappeared. I am uncertain of what I saw but I believe it to have been a UFO;29.5477;-98.2951
