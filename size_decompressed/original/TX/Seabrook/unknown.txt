My guy and I were out for a drive about 12:30 am December 25th 2009 on Nasa Parkway in Seabrook Texas.  We both were startled when I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed a rather large yellow laser beam track from 20 feet behind my truck going over my truck and down the hood.  There was nothing in the sky when we looked up.  I keep going over what it could be in my mind and I have no idea.  It was directly overhead where it came from and the possibility of how it could have been so precise is beyond me.  I wasnâ€™t going to report it but I think it is more important to report an incident when it happens just in case any others saw it as well.;29.584;-95.0396
