The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes before it dissipated. Scene Summary:  The object was viewed from the backyard of my residence located in Seabrook, Texas.  The object appeared in the northern sky, approximately 45 degrees above the horizon.  There were scattered Altocumulus clouds that appeared to be traveling from WNW to ESE.  Temperatures were warm.  The object appeared much like a comet - With a bright head and a tail, with the head on the bottom, and the tail oriented at a 90 degree angle to the horizon.  The object was pinkish orange. Details: My wife and I observed what appeared to be a fire in the sky for approximately 15 minutes.  We observed the object for several seconds before it completely disappeared. It illuminated again a few seconds later, much brighter than before. The object remained stationary in the sky. After approximately 8 minutes, the object brightened again and appeared to elongate. While observing the object, I phoned my mother, who lives approximately a mile from my house. She went outside and also observed the object. After approximately 15 minutes, the object disappeared. My wife recorded approximately 14.5 minutes of very good video of the object. End Report.;29.584;-95.0396
