Witnessed 15 Flame Orbs in Seabrook, Texas.;2015-07-28 19:57:00;5 minutes;Witnessed 15 Flame Orbs in Seabrook Texas. On July 28th, 2015, at 7:57 pm EST, I witnessed 9-15 ufo's flying over Galveston Bay. I was going outside to get my dogs ready for a walk when I saw a bunch of orange-red lights swirling and dancing about 10 miles East from where my house sits, which would put them over Galveston Bay. I didn't know what i was looking at at first, thinking they might be small aircrafts, but more than I've ever seen in one place.  When i tried to focus on them, all i could see was balls of light, no structure to speak of. I called my father out to watch them and ask him if he knew what they were.  They didn't look like standard air craft, no red and blue signal lights and they seemed to make no sound.  We watched them for 4 min, about 15 light globes in total, maybe more, and they moved around each other as if bouncing or bobbing.  They headed south to north, and when they got about 30Â° north of due east, they disappeared, one at a time.  They moved in clusters of 4 to 5, swirling and bobbing around each, but not smooth or precise. Almost drunkenly.  After the main swarm disappeared, one more rose up and floated the same path, bopping and bouncing like the others and disappeared around the area as the rest.  They moved more like living creatures than aircrafts, almost like giant orange fireflies.  Total event was 4-5 min, from initial sighting to the disappearance of the final straggler.;29.584;-95.0396
