800 ft away, I now know the truth;1999-10-19 22:45:00;more than 5 min.;800 ft away, I now know the truth I first noticed the object when it appeared directly between the full moon and my position.The object from the leading edge appeared oval and extremely shiny. not chrome shiny but pearl shiny. the object was approx. 500-800 ft. in the air. I determined this from the height of a water tower next door to my home, which the object passed between the tower and my position. The object passed directly over my roof and over my head. The bottom of the obect appeared to be slightly longer then wide. It also appeared extremely pearlglow silver in color. The bottom had various sized dimples, they almost looked like craters, they were in no geametrical pattern but very noticable. The object, for lack of a better descriptive word, vibrated in flight. It moved south, heading north at no more then 10 miles an hour. as it passed over head we were able to see a full leading edge. It glowed like malting metal. It reminded me of a red hot wood burning stove, that cherry orange red.The object dipped in all directions like when a gyro first starts to spin or when its about to fall over. very hula hoopish. The air was still, a electrical smell in the air, completely silent. 9 min as it floated away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Single pulse of light followed by a high rate of speed and extraoridanary altitude.;2002-08-16 22:00:00;8 Seconds;Single pulse of light followed by a high rate of speed and extraoridanary altitude. We were gazing at starts and looking at Satellites in the sky.  My wife was the first to see a light that started to shine brighter from what we thought was a satellite.  It became brighter and brighter and then dimmed at the same speed.  After it dimmed, it continued to travel on a path, speed and altitude that a satellite would also travel.  There were absolutely no additional indicators that this could be a domestic aircraft.  The speed of the object well exceeded any aircraft that I have ever witnessed.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
round bright orange object started to decend at a very fast speed;2002-09-23 06:30:00;4 minutes;round bright orange object started to decend at a very fast speed As I headed for work on a Monday morning at about 6:30 in the morning, I first saw what looked like a planet next to a star. As I continue on my way to work, I noticed that the round bright orange object started to decend at a very fast speed. It dropped from a 90 degree angle to a 20 degree whitin seconds. I then thought that I was looking at a meteor falling to earth. But then the object just stopped decending. it stayed on a fixed position for about 6 seconds and then it started to travel west at a speed faster then any airplane I have ever seen. I watched it dissaper as it travel west.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436

Blue-green light falls from sky.;2013-08-15 22:00:00;5 seconds;Blue-green light falls from sky. This happened twice:  First time:  Sitting on my porch.  A bright green-blue light far larger than a star.  Perhaps two city blocks away.  The light caught my eye as it was descending straight down from perhaps 100 foot,falling at perhaps falling speed.  I could not see the landing if there was one. Second time:  A few weeks later. The exact same sight.  This time I was sitting at a red light.  It was just turning evening...but not dark yet. I sat, knowing that this was something I'd never seen before and had no idea what it could have been. Please be aware...the light was already falling when it caught my attention.  All I witnessed twice, was the light as it fell from about 100 foot, straight down.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
