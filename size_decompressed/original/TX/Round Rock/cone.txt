While I went back to my car to get water, my daughter saw a UFO slowly flying by above.  She did not mention anything about it until next day.   The next morning she told me about it.  I don't know why she did not mention to me that time. May be she was so confused or something, you know how kids act sometimes.  She said it was cone shape and color was metallic and 5 green lights on the side, and yellow light on bottom, and she could recognize windows (see picture).  She drew a picture to me and it was a really clear image.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
