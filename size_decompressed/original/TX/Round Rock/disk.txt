Walking to a gas station looking at the stars.  Saw a bright orange reg fire in the sky.  I looked right at it and saw there was a disk shape flying right to left. The fire was coming from behind the object.  Object itself was dark grey.  I saw no lights on the craft.  No sound.  I watched it for a few seconds.  After which it completely disappered.  No smoke trail.  No anything.  Was a clear night and since i had a side view i would have seen it turn. There was no wings on it or any kind of logo.   Am i the only one who saw it...it was so fast.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
