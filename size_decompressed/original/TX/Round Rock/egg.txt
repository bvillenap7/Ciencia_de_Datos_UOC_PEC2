I was outside for at least 3 min. i know this because i was almost done ,when i saw it. a blue green orb. Itwas completely still and what seemed out of place. The sky in my area is vary dark because only a few houses were built at this time.Just as i was focusing on the orb it accelerated perpendicularly from the ground faster than anything i have seen in the sky .i am an ex KC-10 and KC-135 mechanic from MARCH AFB. Riverside , California and have even seen the SR-71 at full AB and this Planes speed would not compare.our tankers use to refuel all makes and models and i still have never seen something so quick. in almost the blink of an eye it appeared  as a ball of blue green light and then imploded as it shot upward .;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
