Large black Rectangle hovering over radio towers just south of Georgetown and north of Round Rock;1997-05-05 20:30:00;about 3 minutes;Large black Rectangle hovering over radio towers just south of Georgetown and north of Round Rock My partner and I were headed to an on site trouble call up in Georgetown, TX.  We were just north of Round Rock on *-35 when I looked over towards the group of radio towers to the northeast.  It was dus, but still there was a good amount of twilight out.  The sun I believe had set a few minutes or so minutes earlier.  Above the antena group, I saw this jet black rectangle that had four small white lights on each corner and in the middle was a greenish gold light in the center. It hovered there for what seemed to be a couple of minutes.  My partner and I watched it as we were driving northbound on the interstate.  We knew what radio stations were broadcasting from that tower group.  We tuned in those radio stations and there sememed to be no interfearence from the object.  Shortly thereafter, the light in the middle of the object turned a bright greenish white and took off at an incredible accelaration towards the north north east.  There was no sound from the craft during hovering or during it's departure. I figure that the size of it was roughly the same as a football field, judging it's position relative to the ground and radio towers.  At the distance we were at, it was about the size of your hand held flat and pointed across your line of sight.  That's the last we saw of it.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
