Low object below clouds moving from south to north - red circular light;2007-05-23 22:05:00;10 seconds;Low object below clouds moving from south to north - red circular light My daughter and I left the local WalMart at night and the conditions were cloudy with some breaks in the clouds.  We normally get the usual aviation traffic flying south to the airport in Austin.  As I was opening the door to my car, I looked toward the east and I saw a set up red lights moving in a circular pattern with a red light in the center at the bottom.  The clouds were very low and the object was below the cloud deck.  I heard no sound from the object and I could see planes above the clouds to the west and the sound of their engines.  Anything that low would have been easy to hear.  My daughter saw the same thing and described it to me as I had seen it.  The object disappeared in a few seconds as it was moving very rapidly.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436

7 bright, reddish-orange orbs seen flying in a row;2012-01-01 00:04:00;3 minutes;7 bright, reddish-orange orbs seen flying in a row 1/1/12 12:04 a.m. Round  Rock, TX While watching fireworks being shot off by the next door neighbors, my brother and I noticed what appeared to be three bright, reddish-orange orbs, followed by another set of orbs, followed by two more.  There was no discernible FAA aircraft lighting as they traveled in a line in a northeast direction, no sounds could be detected.   After about 30 seconds, one-by-one each orb banked at what appeared to be a 90-degree angle, and then continued to travel in an upwards direction to the point of disappearing into the night.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
