There were more than I could count at some times, it was a large group of lights that were zooming all over the night sky. At times there were just a few and other times there were alot. They would zoom real fast in one direction and seem to just disappear. It was at night and there was a thunder storm in the back ground. I have video tape of it for an hour. ((NUFORC Note:  Given the duration of the sighting, and given the absence of other reports, we wonder whether the sighting might have been caused by the presence of advertising lights, or some other manmade phenomenon.  That is just a guess.  PD));30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436

Noticed a neighbor pulling up..went toward entrance of Driveway and notice what appeared to be a Trasparent shape coming from the South heading North(First reaction was that is was a debris), but as it moved over me..it was shaped similar to a jigsaw puzzle piece and had a dim Orange glow(the only thing i can compare it to is if you held a flashlight to your hand and instead of seeing that Red glow, it was Orange). It even seemed to be gliding by..no noise at all...Once it was on top of me..it even appeared to be multiple objects..hard to tell...once heading north..it just seemed to vanish...I am still getting this weird feeling...like I saw something i was not supposed to see.....;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
