Round Rock,Texas pool party turns into local mystery!;2004-06-25 03:36:00;5 minutes;Round Rock,Texas pool party turns into local mystery! It was just a regular summer night at the pool enjoying a latenight poolparty.That was until we noticed seven buring objects in the sky.The firey objects alligned themselves in a triangual pattern for three minutes,then began to rotate in a counter-clock wise way and during the last minute seen, they came together in a circle and distanced themselves from each other making a larger circle, and then what appeared to be a total collision,came together making sudden bursts of light.We all noticed that one appeared to fall from the sky in an uncontrolled manner.As the one fell,the others slowly faded out of site.We never saw what happened to the injured one.These fireballs had a red glowing center with a blue forcefield around them.

Orange/red contained sphere with no sound flys across sky, helicopters chase;2013-07-03 22:00:00;5 minutes;orange/red contained sphere with no sound flys across sky, helicopters chase It was arond 10 pm, I was on a bike ride back to house, on street I live on.  Out of corner of my eye, I see something so striking that I fell off my bike!!!!  The only way I can describe it was a contained ball of fire that was orange/red in color.  It looked like it was on fire, but totally contained in a sphere. It was a clear nite with a few low hanging clouds  I was shocked and stood there to witness this object moving across the sky relatively slowly, with absolutly no sound.   There were airplanes in sky at same time with their flashing lights and sound. When I would squint my eyes, the apparent sphere had geometrics to it.  I could literally see the sacred geomety that formed this craft  When it would move through the low hanging clouds, it was like a light show was happening.  Red strobe lights moving through clouds.    When not in cloud, there were no strobe lights, just contained orange/red sphere.  It moved across the entire sky, I watched until I couldn't see anymore.  Another neighbor came out at same time, asked me if I was seeing this. When I said yes, are you seeing the same thing.  He said he has seen this exact thing before move across the sky in the same place.  I have much experience with UFO's and space craft.  I have had many sightings in last 20 years.  But I have never seen something like this. This is new for me.  I was only five houses down from my house, I rode my bike home.  As soon as I got in, I told my family what I had just seen.  As I was speaking, Three low flying helicopters flew directly over, in same path as this object.  I know they were flowing this object.  The heli were flying in formation.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
Orange fireball with two, distinct wings reaching back behind it.;2015-02-25 18:15:00;5 minutes;Orange fireball with two, distinct wings reaching back behind it. My son was taking out the trash and came running in to say there was a strange fireball thing in the sky with two ends.   I went out to take a look, then rushed in to grab my Nikkon 35mm film camera and attached the zoom lens on it for a better look.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get the camera to focus on it as it was moving, in order to take a picture.   What it looked like throught the lens was a ball of fire with back wings.  I would say the shape almost resembled a large plane completely engulfed in flames with no back half, only the front through the wings except the wings reached back behind.  Through the lens, there was no mistaking the orange glow and flames.   Considering its size with the naked eye it had to be comparable to a 747, at least.  It continued on northward until it was out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
