Major UFO event, Round Rock Texas;1997-10-20 20:00:00;1 hour or more;Major UFO event, Round Rock Texas This was a major event in Round Rock Texas, the object was stationary in the sky near the Travis/Williamson County border near the super Walmart shopping center. I first learned of what was going on from a radio DJ on KROX stating a strange object is being seen in that area. From my location in North Austin, I noticed several military jets flying at very high speed at low altitude towards the object. I drove towards the location of the Walmart shopping center and saw a blue/green diamond object in the sky with the military jets circling it. I know hundreds of people in North Austin and Round Rock saw this take place. After an hour or so, the object disappeared and so did the military jets in the sky. In the summer of 1999, I saw news story on one of the local Austin TV stations, of a farmer in Williamson County, finding a military jet top canopy, in his drained cow pond, and he was clueless how this part of a military jet ended up there. That story was never seen on TV again, it could be that one of the military jets flying around the UFO crashed that night,and the pilot ejected, but the canopy of the jet was not found because it was submerged in the cow pond.
