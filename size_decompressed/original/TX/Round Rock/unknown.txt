flashing star with blinking white lights;2003-05-13 21:45:00;65 seconds;flashing star with blinking white lights at 9:45, my friend and i were  looking at the rings around the moon, because the lunar eclispe will be on thurday. there was a star at a 45  degree angle from the rings, which was very bright, i am a ametuer astronomer, and i did not recognize the star, suddenly the star started blinking white on an off light a christmas light bulb.   my friend and i determined it was not an airplane, for it was too high in the sky and also on the west side thier were already small aircrafts flying, suddenly the star took off in a northernly direction, i thought perhaps it was a satellite, or shooting star, however it did not burn out, with in a few seconds it had traversed to the north in a matter of seconds because i was looking at my watch to determine the time, it was traveling straight, then it made a crazy 360 degree circel, and went  into the north and then hovered with the blinking and then disappeared.
