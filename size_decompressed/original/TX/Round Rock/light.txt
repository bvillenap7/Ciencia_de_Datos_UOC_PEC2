SAW 3 BLINKING / JUMPING LIGHTS FOR MORE THAN 3 HOURS;1993-03-15 18:30:00;4 Hours +;SAW 3 BLINKING / JUMPING LIGHTS FOR MORE THAN 3 HOURS Just found this site & the event happened over 10 years ago, so I dont remember the date. AND & tend to be long-winded, sooo....I think it was either late December, early January or March, in either 1992 or 1993. Sorry for being so vague I know I was home on some kind of break from college.  ****SIDE-NOTE...a few months earlier while I was still at school a friend of mine from Round Rock called & told me that she & her fiancee (also a friend) had seen a UFO (in Round Rock). She said that when they went outside they immediately saw it because it was the brightest light in the sky you couldn't miss it. She said they sat there & watched it for over an hour.****  Anyway, so its a few months later & I'm home from school. My friends (the 2 I mentioned earlier) & I had planned on meeting at his apartment in Round Rock & going to dinner in Austin. Leaving my parents house I was driving North through their neighborhood & turned East onto a main road, driving towards Round Rock. It was already dark outside, I'm guessing about 6:30 or 7:00. As SOON as I made the turn East onto the main road & looked up, I saw this bright, captivating light. It was in the Northeast. I had completely forgotten about the UFO my friend had told me about earlier. This light was so bright & out of the ordinary, I watched it for the entire drive to my friends place. The drive took about 5 minutes & the light didn't appear to be moving. It didn't even enter into my mind that this was anything other than a really odd light of some sort. But it was so interesting, I had planned on mentioning it to my friends. So I got to my friends place & I hadn't seen them in a long time, so we got caught up in talking & I completely forgot about this light. I'm guessing its around 7:00 or so now. We went into Austin & had dinner. We were driving back to Round Rock (north) on I-35 around 8:00 or 8:30 or so. I think we were somewhere between Pflugerville & Round Rock & my friend said Oh my god! There it is! & told me that was the UFO they had seen a few months ago. It was the same light I had seen earlier that night & I told them that I had been watching it on my way to his apartment. We watched the light as we continued to drive up I-35. We decided to go park on this small hill about half a mile or a mile East of his apartment & watch the light. It was a quiet area w/no lights around. I dont think it was an overcast night, but I dont remember there being many stars in the sky either. So we back the car up the hill for a better view & we're facing South now. I dont remember the light being any color, just a bright clear light. It was very dark & the object wasn't close enough to make out a shape. It would blink occasionally in a seemingly random pattern. As soon as we got there & were sitting still we could see that the light was moving. And MAN, was it MOVING!!! It was jumping all over the place. We couldn't actually see it moving, it must've been moving too fast. One second it would be in one spot & half a second later it would be to the left or to the right or up or down. It was absolutely not moving in any kind of set direction like an airplane, etc. It was bouncing all over the place.  A little while later another light showed up & then a little while later a 3rd light showed up. They were all in the same general area & were close to each other. They never seemed to get right next to each other though. It never looked like any of them were close enough to touch. When the 3 lights were there, they seemed to be more active than just the one when it was by itself. They were all blinking & moving around & seemed to be communicating in some way. They weren't constantly moving though. They would each stay still for a while & then jump around and then stay still again. We sat there & watched the light/lights for about 1 1/2 hours, until they left. About an hour into watching the lights, my friend & I (not her fiancee) got the VERY distinct feeling that the UFOs knew we were watching them. We both felt like they were extremely upset at us that we were seeing something that we weren't supposed to be seeing. Guessing I first saw the light around 6:30 or 7:00 and last saw it around 10:00 or 10:30. Between my drive to his place & the 3 of us sitting in the car, I viewed it for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Haven't seen anything like it since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
Blinking/fast moving light in clear sky;2003-05-29 22:00:00;4 sec;Blinking/fast moving light in clear sky My family watched the firework display from a local baseball game.  My parents live a short distance from the ballpark, so we were not affected by the stadium lights.  The light show is intense, similar to a 4th of July display.  The sky was fairly clear, stars visible.  After a huge starburst of fireworks, I noticed a light emerge from the starburst.  I thought it was an errant rocket from the show.  But it moved MUCH faster and moved away from the lights emitted from the display.  And much faster than a private plane. It was moving horizontal and staying at level altitude..south to north about 60 degrees in the western sky.  The light was blinking on and off at an inconsistent rate.  When off, a small object could be seen blocking the view of the stars.  It could also been seen moving erratically.  It must have been about 500 to 1000 ft. in altitude because it was cutting through the smoke of the display.  There was no sound AT ALL.  I don't think it was a charge gone bad because there was no sound and it was not emitting a trail of any kind.  Also, such charges do not fly perfectly horizontal.  My brother-in-law also saw this.  I have an elec. engineering background and have my own business.  My brother-in-law was a technical manager for chip fab at a high tech company.  We were not drinking anything other than water and sodas that night.  We saw the light for about 4 seconds until it disappeared behind some houses...we compared notes and agree on the details of our sighting.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
two fast moving star-like objects that turned.;2004-06-20 04:31:00;3 minutes;two fast moving star-like objects that turned. I am an amateur astronomer who spends a fair amount of time watching the sky. I was sitting my driveway about 4:30 a.m. local time,listening to radio, when I noticed a bluish colored starlike object moving rapidly from south to north. I assumed it was a satellite, until it began to make a swing towards the northeast. By the time I returned with 8 x 50 binoculars, it was gone. Roughly one minute later, a second, similar object appeared on the same trajectory. Through binoculars, it looked like a satellite or star. No aircraft lights were evident. The second object also turned slowly toward the northeast, dimming slightly as it did do. Initial brightness of both objects was approx. zero to first magnitude. The impression was of very fast moving objects at great altitude. Total time span was approx. 4:31 to 4:34 a.m. Ojects seemed to dim and flicker slightly as they turned.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
Saw UFO appear, hover, rise and  then disappear;2004-08-15 21:30:00;10 min;Saw UFO appear, hover, rise and  then disappear Me, my son and my friend were outside having a cigarette and my son noticed a light suddenly appear in the distant sky starting to come up from behind the house accross the street. We sat there and watched it and noticed that it would change color from white to yellow then red. As we watched it, it started to rise. It jumped vertically probably the length of my index finger within one eye closed. It started to move right and then back left, like it was hovering. We all just looked at one another and said did you see that.  We could see two planes in the distance, one to the left of the object and one to the top right of the object. You could tell they were planes by the way the lights were flashing and there uniform movement. There were no clouds in the sky. As the plane to the left got closer to the object it just vanished.  The light from the object just distinguished and the object was gone in a second. We just sat there in awe.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
Bright white object that moved extremely fast and appeared out of nowhere.;2006-04-15 23:00:00;20 Seconds;Bright white object that moved extremely fast and appeared out of nowhere. My friend and I were driving back to my house.  We decided to go a longer way then usual.  As we stopped at a stop sign, we both fell silent as we saw a bight white object moving quite quikly across the sky.  It literally came out of nowhere, like someone turned on a light.  It was falling away from us diagonally.  The object was VERY bright and white.  It was a full moon that night and yet this object was just as bright or brighter then the moon and even as it moved away from us it didnt lose ant light.  And it was obvious to both of us that the object was moving AWAY from the car, meaning that it couldn't have been a plane or helicopter light shining directly at us (it was much too bright anyway).  From our view point the object was the size of an eraser head of a pencil.  It was heading towards the highway and when I stepped out of the car to continue watching it over the line of trees, I saw it quickly go straight up and disappear just as quickly as it appeared.  I have been interested in astronomy much of my life and I know the difference between a comet/meteor/shooting star and this was without a doubt none of the above.  Both of us were completely amazed by the speed and how bright the object was.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
3 Fast-moving lights over Round Rock Texas;2010-01-10 05:45:00;2 seconds;3 Fast-moving lights over Round Rock Texas Date/Time:  1/10/2010  0545CST  My location:  N30d28’50.3  W97d38’52  Facing ESE  I was on my back porch smoking a cigarette and looking at the moon.  I was not wearing glasses nor could I explain what I saw by finding any reflective surfaces within the field of view. Three lights, a little larger than a star appears, appeared to the left of the moon (about 3 deg) and were moving as soon as I saw them.  I think the lights were white, but the event was so short that I’m really not sure.  They moved across 60 deg of my field of view within less than 2 seconds from the same inclination of the moon to about 10deg lower.  My view was then blocked by a tree so I couldn’t see where they went.  I walked to where I could see behind the tree and the lights were gone. The lights were aligned along the axis of movement, but were slightly out of alignment.  I would have thought this to be a jet except that it was moving way too fast and there was no sound at all.  If it were close to account for the movement, there should have been sound (the early morning was silent).  If it were far to explain lack of sound then it was moving way too fast. My background:	I am an IT manager at a large electronics manufacturing company.  I’m a family man with a wife and two teenage daughters.  I’ve never seen or reported a UFO before.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
Strange object moving fast in the night sky.;2011-03-01 21:00:00;30 seconds;Strange object moving fast in the night sky. One night as me and my son were walking back from the store I looked at the clear sky as it was meant to happen, I saw a white light like a plane moving fast in a curvaceous manner high in the sky.  At first I thought it was a plane but when I saw the object moving in a weird way I realized it was a ufo. planes don't move fast at that altitude and specially in a curvaceous manner.

A ball of light larger than a commercial airliner.;2011-09-03 09:00:00;1 minute;A ball of light larger than a commercial airliner. I went out into my backyard to get some fresh air and a light in the sky behind a tree had caught my eye.  i didnt think nothing of it, i thought it was a bright star at first, but then when i looked again it had moved to another spot.   as i kept looking through the top of the tree line i saw a plane flying towards my directing and thought it was the plane.  but then i saw this huge ball of light come from behind the tree line.  the light was as big as the plane if not bigger and there paths had crossed the light went by first then the plane. As the ball of light was moving away i kept looking back and fourth at the plane and the light. there were no blinking lights on the ball of light it was just a solid light.  the ball of light was bigger compared to the plane passing by.  and as the ball of light hit some cloud cover you could see a triangle shaped body. it was massive how big this thing was compared to the plane.  all i heard was the plane passing by, the ball of light didnt make any kind of noise.   i watched it for a few more seconds and then it just vanished. im still in shock that i even saw something like that.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436

Two green lights hovering with no sound and no movement.;2014-07-03 22:00:00;5 minutes;Two green lights hovering with no sound and no movement. We were standing in our back yard because we had heard a very loud group of explosions.  Turns out some group was doing their 4th of July early.   Then we saw a group of lights hovering in the sky no where near the fireworks display.  There were 2 bright green lights that appeared to be facing us and several smaller red lights behind them.   The green lights were on solid and the red lights were flickering.  The object was utterly stable with no noticeable movement and no sound or any other structure visible.   After about 5 minutes there were a several quick bursts of bright red lights in between the 2 green lights and the object dropped down out of sight in a very linear unnatural manner, as if being pulled out of the sky.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
Two white orbs flying low and fast across the sky disappeared after approx. 10 seconds.;2014-07-12 21:30:00;10 seconds;Two white orbs flying low and fast across the sky disappeared after approx. 10 seconds. While loading my groceries into the back of my SUV tonight at approximately 9:30pm I looked up in the sky to see two extremely bright white lights, one behind the other, traveling very low and very, very fast across the sky.  Then they both just disappeared. At first I thought it might be a plane, the lights being one on the wing and the other on the tail, but that got dismissed based on the speed and height at which they were both traveling.  Much too low to be an aircraft.  Then it struck me that neither one made any noise at all despite how low and fast they went.  Next thing I knew they disappeared altogether. I may have thought I was crazy, but I looked over and the old man loading his groceries next to me turned white, jaw dropped and he quickly got into his car and sped away.  He looked terrified.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436

Then a orange 737 was flying from west to east and I looked away and they disappeared.  I tried to call my son to see if he could see them and he was looking in wrong direction.

Looking out bedroom window towards the west. We saw 5 red bright lights go up into the sky. ((Spacelink satellites??);2020-01-01 00:12:00;10 minutes;Looking out bedroom window towards the west. We saw 5 red bright lights go up into the sky.  At first we saw 1 red light move up into the air and then another red light followed it about 5-10 secs later.  3 more lights followed in the same pattern.  These lights moved up into the sky at an angle.  The lights eventually faded away to where we couldn't see them no more.these light looked like the came from the ground. I told my mom what we saw and she said someone on next door app for her neighborhood in Burleson Texas saw 3 red lights in the sky. I looked at the video and it looked like the same red lights.;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
