On April 1st 1997, myself and two friends of mine were pulling out a parking lot of a highschool livestock farm.  We were in a chevy truck driving with the windows down.  As we were leaving the school, my friend that was sitting to my right noticed a some lights at just above the tree tops across the street approx. fifty yards.  He then asked When did they build a water tower there? My friend that was driving respond quickly that, that is not a water tower! At that moment this unidentified object took off to the north of where we were about 150 yards above the ground.  We drove down the McNeil road, driving east trying to catch up with the object.  It flew northest and then flew north along I-35, the turned north west. It was then that we lost sight of it.  The lights were in a triangle shape. All lights on the object were white. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  Witness may describe the object that was reported to NUFORC over Round Rock and Flower Mound, TX, in May (??) 1997.  PD));30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
