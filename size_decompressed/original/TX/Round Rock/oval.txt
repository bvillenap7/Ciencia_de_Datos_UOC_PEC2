Amber, oval lights over Round Rock, Texas on 8.15.10;2010-08-15 21:45:00;few minutes;Amber, oval lights over Round Rock, Texas on 8.15.10 Around 9:45p.m. CST in Round Rock, Texas, facing West, my mother and I were  taking a walk.  We had just been admiring the clear skies and looking at the  big dipper before we turned a corner. My mom pointed out the first light and I didn't even look and dismissed it as  an airplane, she said.  Then I looked up and up from the ground somewhere  ahead of us flew amber tinted oval lights.  They look like what a steet light in  the dark.   One after the other they flew up at a 45 degree angles and then  disappeared before our eyes as they went off into the distance.  At one time  one got so close to the other that it looked like it was on top of the other  one.    As we watched several fly up into the sky I ran to my parents house and  got my dad who witnessed the last couple fly up.  We counted 9 in a row. Neighbors at the end of the street were also standing in awe and witnessed  the same.   We also ran into a group of boys who had been riding their bikes, who were standing on the sidewalk watching the sky in awe and asked us what  we thought we all had just seen.  It was scary and amazing at the same time. We immediately thought of UFO's.  After watching them fly off we did see an  airplane in the sky headed another direction.  We knew after seeing the  airplane that what we saw tonight was not an airplane, helicoptor, or  anything else we have ever seen in the sky!;30.5147908098259;-97.6699028207436
