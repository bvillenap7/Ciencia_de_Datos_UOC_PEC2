Unexplained lights over West Texas;2009-10-09 20:30:00;15 minutes;Unexplained lights over West Texas At approximately 2030 last night, I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  The skies were clear, and there were quite a few stars.  I looked to the west, and noticed, what I at first thought was an aircraft at altitude.  I continued watching it, as it was flickering different colored lights (red, blue, and white) and kept my attention.  After some time (probably 30-40 second), I noticed it wasn't moving.  Further, it made no noise. I rose from my chair, and moved to a different position in my yard to make sure it wasn't leaves on a nearby tree causing the flickering.  I stood watching it for another minute, and then went to the door to call my 13 year old son out to confirm what I was seeing. I told him to put his jacket on and come see, while warning him not to look at any street lights in the area (to preserve his night vision). I pointed the object out to him, and asked him what he saw (I didn't want to lead him).  He watched it for a few seconds and went through the same thought processes I did.  At first he thought it was an aircraft, until he noted it wasn't moving.  Then he offered that it might be a nova (he is studying just such a thing in school). I sent him into the house to get our digital camera, and I took several photos of the object, but it appeared that the camera was unable to capture an image. We watched for several more minutes, and noticed that it hadn't changed its location or actions.  The evening was fairly cool, so after 10 minutes or so, we decided to go in, and I would check it later. Thirty minutes later, I went back out and searched the general area of the sky, and the object was gone.  I looked lower towards the horizon to see if it was simply a star that may have gone closer to setting, but I couldn't locate it. I will be going back out at the same time this evening in an attempt to locate it again.;33.1328;-100.2369
