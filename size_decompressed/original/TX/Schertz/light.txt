On 02/28/2020 I was heading out to work at 05:45 AM and as I turned and looked east at the early morning clear sky, I noticed 10 to 15 lights spaced apart moving in unison headed north of my location. T hey moved parallel to the big dipper, which was to the west of myself at that time. I watched as they traveled to the point of out of sight then one to two lights would fly by on the same flight path. They only passed half the distance of the initial group before disappearing out of my sight.;29.5799836842105;-98.275178684211
