I was looking at the sky when I saw a round UFO fly across the sky, and beyond the tree line.  It had two sets of long yellow/green lights on the bottom.  It was completely silent, though it was close enough that I should have been able to hear an engine.  It was very fast, moving quicker than a satellite. The craft did not emit any beam or aura, just four lights.  No effects experienced. I live near an airport and regularly see helicopters and military airplanes fly over but never anything like this.  This was a flying vehicle that I cannot explain.;29.5799836842105;-98.275178684211
