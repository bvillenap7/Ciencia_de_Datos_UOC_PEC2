Kite-shaped light, with moving tail.;2017-06-08 00:00:00;right before dark;Kite shaped light, with moving tail. Did y'all have any reports of a strange lit up object over the Nacogdoches sky's tonight?  It was bright and had a kite like tail that moved back and forth.  It stayed in the same spot for about an hour, then drifted off up into the sky, until it disappeared..    I filmed it but it with my phone, but its way up in the skyâ€¦;31.7978;-94.8539
