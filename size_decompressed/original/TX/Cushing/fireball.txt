I;2000-09-21 21:00:00;1-2 seconds;Object passed straight overhead, moving from north to south. It seemed to be very close, seemingly to be just above a large oak tree. It was bright orange in color and about the size of a softball. In a flash it tapered down in a streak and disappeared very quickly. There were other people right there with me, but nobody else (to my knowledge) saw it. I suppose it could've been a meteor, but I've never seen anything like it before.;31.7978;-94.8539
