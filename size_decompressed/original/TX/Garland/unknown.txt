red and greenish lights seen over Dallas, Texas viewed from Garland, Texas.;2000-11-04 00:20:00;10 to 15 seconds;red and greenish lights seen over Dallas, Texas viewed from Garland, Texas. I live in Garland, Texas only about two miles north of the Dallas city limits and just two blocks east of Garland Road. On the 4th of November just 20 minutes after midnight I was on the deck in back of my house looking south. I saw two objects moving at a fairly slow rate of speed. I would estimate their speed was less than one hundred miles per hour. One of the objects was trailing the other. I could not make out what shape they had. All I could see was two very bright lights on each object. The color of the lights was red in front and a greenish looking light in the rear of each object. They caught my attention because the lights were very large and very bright. I am very familiar with the size of safety navigational lights on aircraft. These lights were very large and much brighter than safety lights on aircraft. Also the lights did not blink, they stayed on all the time and were very bright. The lights were just above the horizon and they were a good di! stance away. (I would estimate between five and ten miles away) At first I saw them traveling in a north-eastern direction and then they turned left and were traveling in a north-western direction when I lost sight of them as they disappeared behind the trees. I only saw them for a short while, approximately ten to fifteen seconds.  I was in the Air Force for twelve years and am very familiar with aircraft lights. These lights were definitely not normal in that they were very large, very bright and they stayed on all the time.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643

While trying to divert my gaze from its landing lights, I noticed a very dim object about 1 degree of arc in length and of an indeterminate width, moving perpendicular to the path of the 737.  It seemed to occult some stars as it travelled (about 1.5 degrees/sec) at an indeterminate altitude.  It appeared to have no luminescence except for the faintest shimmer as it moved across the starry sky.  It was travelling perpendicular to its longitudinal axis.  Its magnitude I would estimate between 4-5.  It made no noise.  I observed it for about ninety seconds until it was no longer visible.  It travelled unidirectionally North-to-South for the duration of its visibility.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643

House is well insulated normally cannot hear aircraft unless they are low and close.   Time about 10:25 am CST. Heard steady sound of aircraft listened to determine if it was radial piston engines because I like to see and hear warbirds.  Wasnâ€™t a radial it was a jet, rocket or re-entry sound-a steady roar.  Went outside to back patio and yard.  Sound was from southwest looked ahead of sound and spotted a reflection just SW of overhead moving rapidly to SE. It had the appearance of previous sightings of shuttle passing overhead on landing approach toward Canaveral.  Lost sight after it passed overhead and moved toward SE.  Sound continued for several seconds after sight was lost. Went inside and checked major TV network channels for news--no results.  Checked internet for shuttle Endeavor news--it is supposed to be still in orbit attached to space station.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
Multiple reddish colored objects moving in a single-file path from southeast to northwest while gaining altitude.;2014-10-29 19:20:00;1 minute;Multiple reddish colored objects moving in a single-file path from southeast to northwest while gaining altitude. At approximately 7:20 p.m. on October 29, 2014, I was at the intersection of North Garland Road and Beltline Road in Garland, Texas.  I was in a parking lot, looking south.  I observed multiple objects emitting a red colored light.  The objects would originate from low on the horizon, and travel from the southeast to the northwest while gaining altitude.  So, from my vantage point, the objects were moving from left to right and upward.  Note that, if these were conventional aircraft, they would have shown a green light, as I was observing the starboard (right) side of the craft.  The objects appeared one or two at a time, and followed the same path as the previous.  I observed several of these red light objects originate low in the horizon and move upward and to the right along the same path in the sky, over the course of approximately 1 minute.  The objects were consistent in size and velocity with conventional aircraft, which were also visible in the sky f! rom my location (urban area) however, as previously mentioned, the coloration of the light was not consistent with conventional aircraft.  The light was reddish in color and had a pulse at a relatively low frequency, also some white light was visible within the red light emitted.  The objects were at a distance such that I was not able to observe their exact shape.  I was unable to detect any sounds from the objects, as the urban area was noisy at that time in the evening.  Also, each of the objects would apparently gain altitude until it appeared as a small pinpoint of light in the sky (star).  Two other witnesses observed the objects after I pointed them out in the sky.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
Shooting Star?;2015-09-29 20:00:00;10-15 seconds;Shooting Star? I live in Garland, TX, a Northeastern suburb of Dallas County.  I was sitting in my patio, facing North. I sit out there and enjoy a cigar a couple of times a month. It was approximately 8:00 P.M. and I had just taken a puff of my smoke and tilted my head back to exhale.  As I did, I saw what I thought was a shooting star, going North.  I have seen meteors/shooting stars on many occasions and thought no different.  I could distinctly make out flames on this and thought I had a great view of a meteorite streaking across the evening sky. The flames diminished and I could see something that looked like a star, moving across the sky. From my vantage point it looked like a star, except that it was moving.  I then saw another star coming from the other direction, heading South.  This object was perhaps a little brighter than the North-bound shooting star. The two star-looking objects came together and slowly faded out. I do not believe they were stars. I called The National UFO Reporting Center immediately.
