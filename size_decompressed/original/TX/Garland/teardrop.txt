I was driving home from work coming southbound on Arapaho Rd to the intersection of Beltline Rd. I made a left headed East and once I pasted Brand Rd. to my left there was a bright light that came out of nowhere.  I lit up the sky in a blue,white light and it had an haze around it.  I thought is was a flare or left over firework but it went down and then came up and I saw a small tail behind it.  I was waiting on a sonic boom or engine or rotor sound as it past over my car but there was no sound.  It flew over my car and headed in a southeast direction.  I looked behind me and didn't' see it again.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
