I notice this red rectangular shape next to one of those long skinny pole with the little red light that blinks and fades, blinks and fades etc.(I think it's one of those type of communicator) Anyway's at the time I had no idea what it was, so I kept watching it wondering what it was. It would blink every two seconds. It was right next to the blinking red light that fades. Then all of a sudden the next time it blinked it blinked at a 45 degree angle. I could not see it move because it was really dark. Then when it blinked it went twice the distance at the same angle. Then when it blinked again it was 5 to 10 times the distance. It accelerated really fast. I was swerving on the road watching in awe. I told other people but they did not believe me. I still remember like it just happened yesterday. I was so excited.

Large, red rectangle hovers over parking lot in Garland TX.;2008-05-27 07:00:00;1 minute;Large, red rectangle hovers over parking lot in Garland TX. At 7:am on May 27th 2008, I was standing in my back bed room in Garland TX. which faces west.  I was looking out the window of my apartment which faces a huge parking lot in a shopping center.  A large bright red rectangular object suddenly appeared over the parking lot and hovered a few seconds and then took off flying over our apartment building going east at an incredible (what seemed like super sonic) speed and quickly disappeared. It was very close and appeared to be about 150' long and maybe 50' in width and 50' in height. I was very shaken by this experience and I feel sure that at 7am in the morning there must have been other people who saw this object.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
Garland Texas 7-13-2014 Ufo spotted near laprada and 635.;2014-07-12 20:30:00;15 minutes;Garland Texas 7-13-2014 Ufo spotted near laprada and 635 At 8:30, my son and I were walking near Laprada and 635 this craft was only a 100 feet off the ground.  It was triangular shaped with 3 white lights, and a green light in the middle.  It cloaked itself and took off at a very high speed and disappeared.  A neighbor that was near saw it also.   So we were not losing our minds at what we saw.  My name ((male's name deleted))  I don't care if you know my name.   I did not believe they existed, but oh yeah they are here people.   And my question is why they hide like that.  Anyone  else seen the same thing contact me at ((address deleted)).   Thanx;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
