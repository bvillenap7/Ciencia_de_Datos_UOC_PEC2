Triangle UFO in Garland, TX in 1992;1992-07-01 22:00:00;5 minutes;Triangle UFO in Garland, TX in 1992 I’m a college student living in Germany who recently separated as a staff sergeant from the U.S. Army a few months ago.  I am 34 years old.  I hold an associate’s degree.  I am also an expert in long-haul transmissions technology with six years of military experience in the communications field.  Prior to my military service, was in project management for five years with a large telecommunications company.  I lived in and around Garland, Texas, from age 5 until I enlisted at age 28. I apologize, as the date and time of my account is only a guess, as it took place over 15 years ago.  However, I estimated the date based on a few facts: I had recently graduated high school in May 1992 it was summer I was driving an '87 Honda Civic during the incident, a car which I owned at that time.  The time was late evening, an hour or so after sunset. A childhood friend of mine and I were driving SE down what is today President George Bush Toll Way (TX 190) at around 2200.  Today, the area is very built up with shopping malls and restaurants.  But back in 1992, the only building in the area was a high school (my high school).  It was dark and, at the time, there were no street lamps.  As I'm driving, my friend points to the sky through the windshield and tells me to look.  He's pointing straight up through the windshield to a point directly over my car.  And, while it was difficult for me to lean forward over the steering wheel to see what it was he was pointing at, I caught several glimpses of it.  This is what I saw: three reddish hued lights in a triangle configuration, with one brighter light in the very center of the formation.  And, while the sky was dark, the space between the lights was even darker, giving the shape a distinct triangular outline.  Because I was driving, I could only glance at the object for a few seconds at a time before I had to put my eyes back on the road.  It was difficult to tell whether or not the object was moving along with us, or if it was at such an elevation that it appeared motionless from our perspective.  When I would glimpse it, I could tell the object was rotating slowly in a counter-clockwise direction, at an estimated rate of one rotation every 30 seconds.  We were now approaching a stop sign, and I brought the car to a stop. Without speaking, immediately after I stopped, I shut the engine and lights off we exited the car and stood up in the road to get an unobstructed view.  To our delight, the object was still there, hovering silently.  Now that we were no longer moving, we could tell the object wasn't moving, either.  It was completely stationary (though it continued to rotate in place) and produced absolutely no noise.  As far as the size of the object, it was difficult to estimate.  But I recall that, from my perspective on the ground, the triangle appeared to be about the same size as the shape one can make by touching the thumbs and index fingers of both hands and holding them at arm's length directly overhead (approximately 4 x 4 x 4). We continued to watch the object for another thirty seconds or so when another car began to approach us from the rear.  We quickly hopped back in my car, started it up, and pulled it to the side of the road to make way. As soon as the other car pulled away, we got back out.  But when we looked up at the sky, there was nothing there.  Nothing at all.  No noise, no lights.  Whatever we had been observing only seconds earlier had vanished.  I don't recall ever telling anyone about it, and I don't believe my friend or I ever discussed the incident with each other again after that night.  Of course, we haven't spoken to or seen one another in over ten years. I realize it's been many years since this took place.  In fact, I rarely even think about it.  However, it was several years ago that I first read an article or saw a news report about someone witnessing an object matching the exact description of what I'd seen so long ago.  Since then, I've seen or read many other separate but similar accounts.  And, since I've always been somewhat of a skeptic with regards to UFO sightings, I tried my best to pretend what I'd seen must've been something else...maybe something I would've recognized had it been daylight.  However, ever since that day, when I'm outside at night, I still find myself staring up at the sky, semi-hoping that I might see the same thing again, if for no other reason than to prove to myself that whatever I saw actually does exist. Though I still remain skeptical, I felt I should at least contribute my experience so as to at least add my account to the collection of other similar sightings.  Skeptic or not, I saw what I saw.

Triangle UFO Lake Ray Hubbard.;1993-08-01 20:00:00;Minutes;Triangle UFO lake ray hubbard. So this was on a cool evening right before fall.  Me and my GF at the time went swimming..  In the evenings, when it's a little cooler, we would wait for the outside AC units to turn on before getting out of the pool..  The AC units would blow warm air out and keep us warm as we hopped from one another till we got home.   Anyway, we are in the pool and I hear what sounds like an AC unit cut on.  I look around and don't see any of the fan's moving..  I don't remember why but I looked up to see 3 bright lights in a triangle formation hovering above us..   We both seen it than looked at each other, before I bolted out of the pool area leaving her behind (I know, I know...I was only 13 at the time).   Last time I spoke to her was probably 15 years ago and she remembers the story exactly as I do.   Lots of weird things out by Lake Ray Hubbard.
