1978 Red Saucer Garland texas;1978-08-01 20:00:00;one minute;1978 Red Saucer Garland texas  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I was 7 years old about to go to sleep. the above location data is just a guess I don't remember where I lived exactly. this was the first of many UFO sightings through my life. this is the only one that was without a doubt I knew what I was looking at. the others were just anomalous lights.  ok, the sighting: I was going to sleep, staring out my window and I saw a glowing orange/red saucer it must have been less than 100 yards away. it was zig zagging in a weird arc and went behind a building. I got all freaked out and ran downstairs and told my mom I saw a flying saucer and she told me to go to bed and stop fibbing. the craft was pretty big.. at least 30ft across. I remember this like it was yesterday. my first thought (mind of a 7 year old) is I thought it was the lost saucer from sid and marty craft... then my mom told me there was no such thing .. that freaked me out and I could not sleep for weeks. I have had a very crazy childhood involving stuff like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
Dark Gray smokey shaped saucer above the highway;2007-12-27 07:30:00;5-10 minutes;Dark Gray smokey shaped saucer above the highway I reported this before on the website, and was happy to know someone in Stephenville also saw it. Driving into Dallas on Dec 27th, I saw a plate up in the sky and then it turned horizontal and looked exactly like a UFO. It was about 1 mile wide and was very fluid and blurry looking. It was diagonally going down, like it was going to land. It was a VERY overcast day. The craft was dark gray, no lights. I was embarrassed to tell anyone but this website. (see previous entry) I heard no noise, but definitely saw a fluid-like metal object up in the sky for several minutes. It was not a reflection because it kept going down to the left and I was traveling straight ahead down the highway. Please let me know if anyone else has seen this in Garland, between Mesquite and Dallas, Texas, 2 hours East of Stephenville. Thank you so much.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
