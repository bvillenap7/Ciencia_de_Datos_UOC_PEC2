Possible fireballs in the sky that burned out over our house.;2013-08-27 22:23:00;10 minutes;Possible fireballs in the sky that burned out over our house. We were looking out side as we walked our dog and saw 10 or more orange lights in the sky.  They seemed almost like air planes but there was no sound and no other lights.  I did get a couple of pictures.   As we were watching them they went over our house and began to burn out.  They were all on fire.  I have never seen anything like this before.   I looked it up on line to see if anyone else had seen or reported this but no one had so I thought that I would. Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect an evening sighting, and have changed the time above to reflect that fact.  PD));32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
