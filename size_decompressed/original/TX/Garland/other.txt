I was 4 or 5, and it was Halloween.  I had been across the street from my house playing with a friend, and my mother came to take me home for bed.  I always went to bed around 8:00. As we were walking across the street, I saw almost directly over me, and flying over my house (about 10 ft above house), a line of crafts that were copper, and shaped like missiles.  They were going pretty slowly, and there were no windows or anything like that.  It made no noise. I had the distinct feeling that there was somebody(s) up there watching us--the street was full of children in costumes. I asked my mother what they were, and pointed to them, but she could not see anything.  I pointed again, and still she couldn't see anything, and we went in my house.  I wasn't thinking at that time about aliens--I just knew it was something I had never seen before, was very unusual, and that nobody else seemed to notice.  It wasn't until years later I would connect it with the possibility of it being extraterrestrial.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
