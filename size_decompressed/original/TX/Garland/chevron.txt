Then all of a sudden I hear a whoosh of air heading my way with some speed it reminded me of the mlrs rockets I have witnessed before but with no engine sound.  I look up to try and locate the air rushes source and I see a large boomerang shaped cloud moving very low and very very very fast but the only sound that was heard was the wind rushing over it looked like a flock of geese flying in a v shape over head moving at 2000+ mph I kid you not. It was so incredible I never knew such a thing existed however I know now that this is real.  I could not believe when I typed into google search UFO sightings in Dallas that the first description I read matched my sighting to the t, that really reinforced exactly what I just saw 20 min ago.  I believe we have a new technology out there gentleman. One that is not &quotout of this world&quot. I don't believe in &quotufos&quot thats why.  I'm a ! vet.
