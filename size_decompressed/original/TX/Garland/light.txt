Moving star plays connect the dots.;1980-11-05 22:00:00;Long time;Moving star plays connect the dots. The year was 1980, the year my husband and I met. We were at his parents house and he and I decided take a blanket and go sit out on the yard to look at the stars and have some privacy. I remember we wound up wrapping the blanket around us because the night was chilly. The sky was dark and we could see plenty of stars. However, the one that caught our attention was the one that was moving. At first, we thought it might be a plane. But then I realized that was imposible because it went from one end of the sky to the other in a matter of about 8 or 9 seconds then would come to a dead stop, change directions and traverse the sky again. The star seemed to be moving as if it were connecting dots, like in a coloring book. We noticed it first near the northwest horizon, then moving in a straight line it traveled directly above us and ended over in the Southeast, then it stopped and started again moving West, then it connected dots mainly overhead after that which made us wander if somehow it knew we were watching it. We didn't know what it was but agreed it had to be otherworldly. The moving star carried on for so long that after a while, we finally lost interest in watching it.

Shooting star changes directions multiple times lasting 20 seconds;2002-10-05 01:30:00;20 seconds;Shooting star changes directions multiple times lasting 20 seconds The light was only slightly larger than a star, and seemed to fall like any other shooting star but then it stopped and went back up and then back down again like an upside down N and then it went across the sky horizontaly, made a small loop, and then continued on horizontally a little more before going up a little more, back down a little more, and then vanishing. I was wathing for shooting stars with a friend, and we saw about 4 shooting stars, some before some after the incident. It was sometime between 1:30 and 2:20.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
twinkling multicolored light in NE sky viewed from Dallas Area 9-13-06;2006-09-13 23:50:00;30 + minutes;twinkling multicolored light in NE sky viewed from Dallas Area 9-13-06 NE sky about 45 degrees, to the left of the moon near the horizon, spotted what appeared to be a star twinkling rapidly and changing colors ver rapidly.  Object began to move northerly and away from the horizon at a slight diagonal slowly.  Object then stopped moving northerly and continued to rise up from the horizon.  The speed at which it flashed different colors was very fast, faster than 2 or 3 flashes of color per second.  Object appeared to remain pretty much stationary for a number of minutes, it was still in the same place when i decided to quit observing.  I tried to take photos and video.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
Hazy light circling eradically overhead at 3:00 a.m. in an ever-changing mostly eliptical course, above the clouds.;2007-01-27 03:00:00;three hours;Hazy light circling eradically overhead at 3:00 a.m. in an ever-changing mostly eliptical course, above the clouds. My friend and I went outside to smoke a cigarette around 11:00 PM 11/26 and witnessed a light circling around in the sky above my backyard. I also woke my mother up to see it, as well.   At first we thought it may be a spotlight (a new club opening up or something), but the center of the activity was in a strictly residential suburbian area and the light changed its course, moving eradically slow then fast and not in a perfect circle, sometimes a square or triangular course, and small then bigger ellipses, but always clockwise.  We could see no beams coming from the ground either, and the light seemed to be radiating parallel to the ground from an invisible object.  (It seems to beam out some at the right and left sides of the circumference, the course being mostly elliptical.)  It is now after 4:00 am 11/27, and the light is still there circling.   Last I checked I saw other light trailing it.  It was breaking in two at the middle of the course (bottom of ellipse) and then the smaller light followed it to the left and upward.  Kind of like the Atari game Breakout where it is guided.  Does that make sense?  It moved slow then fast like that.  And, the main light surged, too.  Like I said, it seemed to radiate from a center point above the clouds.   I also saw the light skip and appear further along the circumference immediately several times!  The light is not circular, but hazy (even inbetween the clouds where it is clear sky) and shapeless.  Not like any spotlight I’ve ever seen, and it’s in the middle of the night and has been going on for five hours.  Also, it held it’s position when we went to the front of the house, seemed to be circling over us at the same place as in the backyard.  So, it must have been pretty far away and high up over the clouds.   I hope this makes sense I’ve tried to give as accurate of a description as possible.  I tried to capture it on camera, but it was too dark to pick anything up (maybe I just don't know how to use the thing!);32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
Flashing red blue green light hovering in sky.;2012-09-20 04:00:00;Hours;flashing red blue green light hovering in sky. Shiny bright looking distant light. It looked like a star at first but it couldn't be.  It was flashing multiple colors, green, red, blue, maybe others.  Definitely not a star I've ever seen.  It looked like it was hovering in place but over long periods of time it slowly changed location.  But very little to almost none.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643

Bright light larger and brighter than anything in sky.  stationary google christmas star..thats it  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  Anon.  PD));2016-12-22 18:40:00;20 minutes;bright light larger and brighter than anything in the sky. stationary google christmas star..thats it i went out at 1840 pm to have a smoke and noticed a big bright light in the southwest sky.  I first thought it was a aircraft of sometime but it wasnt moving. i watched it for 7-10 minutes and it was stationary in the sky.  This light was huge compared to stars and other lights in the sky. I put my little finger on my right hand over the light to try and gauge its size.  The lights size was that about halve the size of a pencil eraser.  It was very bright and to be honest the closest thing I could compare it too and i know this sound hokey but it's shape reminded me of the star of Bethlehem...just a big bright light with a four point star look.  I came inside house to grab camcorder and it's battery was dead so i started charging my camera.  I then went to google and googled astronomy events and all i could find was that Jupiter was near waning crescent moon at 1am this morning.  I could find nothing about what I was seeing.  I went back out and watched some more and it was just a big stationary light. At no time did i think this was a Helicopter as I see those all the time with there spot lights on.  Since it was dark I couldnt tell if this was a celestial or terrestrial light...i believe it was celestial.  I came back outside at 1950 and the light is completely gone!! it is just gone...we do have some clouds but I can still see the stars that are much dimmer than this light in the southwest sky.  I have no idea what I saw. I wanted to submit this report in case someone else witnessed the same thing.  I just googled star drawings and the image that fits what I saw is the christmas star...that's the closest i can describe for you.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
Fleet of bright lights.   ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?
