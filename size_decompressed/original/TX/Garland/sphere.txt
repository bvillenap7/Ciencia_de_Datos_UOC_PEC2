Vibrant White Flashing Sphere Moving Erratically.;2016-06-26 00:34:00;2 minutes;Vibrant White Flashing Sphere Moving Erratically ((NUFORC Note:  We are unconvinced that this is a serious-minded report.  Possible hoax, we believe.  PD)) Observing the stars with one of my friends when we looked into the Northeastern sky at about 45 degrees.  We both see a large spherical light moving erratically through the sky about a quarter mile from us.  It was flashing but with no pattern or timer just random flashes at different delays.  It flashed with some intensity almost like a high power strobe flash or led.  It stuck around for close to 2 minutes before the light faded out and then with a larger flash disappeared.  There was no sound, no wind, no visual cause of the light it just seemed to appear with a quite literal flash.  I attempted to film the Phenomena but was un able to get decent footage of the sighting.  Animals acted very strange in the are having a large flock of birds take flight during the ordeal and then landing after the object was gone.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
