I was sitting on the couch, and when I glanced outside, I saw blinking lights up in the sky, I live not too far from an airport, so I thought it was a plane. But I looked up at it a few minutes later, and it was still there, and it stayed there for at least 15 minutes, and I even went outside to look at it. The lights were red, white, and blue. It didn't move, and I think if I could have seen it in the day it would have been vertical oval shaped. There were four lights I could see, and the ship looked rather small. When I was outside looking at it, I got the creepy feeling that I was being watched, and the feeling lasted after I got inside. When I got inside I looked out the window, and it was gone.;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
