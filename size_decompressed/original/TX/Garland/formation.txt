I stopped at a stop sign and recorded them, they were moving quickly in my direction.  They began changing formation, but someone was coming up behind me, so I had to start driving, and lost sight of them before I could pull over again. They seemed to be heading North, from where I could see them, they'd have been over South Garland or Mesquite before losing sight of them.   By now, they're probably in Oklahoma from how fast they were going. I got poor cell phone video of it: http://goo.gl/up7nHx;32.8946096909383;-96.6376143530643
