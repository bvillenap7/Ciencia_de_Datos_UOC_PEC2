looks like a star;2003-07-10 02:00:00;04:00;looks like a star Used binoculars for a better veiw. The object changed colors, red,blue and white. Had to use a stationary object for judgment on movement of object. Very slow moving like watching the hands of a clock. Man made planes were in the area. But the planes came and went. Like the object was not even there. I have observed these objects for a whole month. I have counted three or more at a time. They are here still but in different areas. Our weather has been shoty the last two days so our star gazing night skys have been coverd in clouds but, you can still see the objects. If anyone lives in the collingsworth area wait for complete darkness and look for a colored star remember where you saw it and where it ended up at. My sister aswell sees them in california. I wonder what the heck they are?;34.8684;-100.2234
