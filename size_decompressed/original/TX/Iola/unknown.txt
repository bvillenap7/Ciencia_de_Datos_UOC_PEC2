WHEN A BRIGHT LIGHT CAME SHINING DOWN THROUGH THE OAK TREE THAT STANDS ABOUT 20 FEET AWAY.  IT WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH TO CAUSE CLEAR SHADOWS ON THE GROUND OF THE LEAVES AND LIMBS IN THE TREE.  THE LIGHT MOVED TOWARD THE CARPORT AND THEN WENT OFF.  I HEARD NO NOISE OF ANY KIND TO SUGGEST THAT IT WAS A AIRPLANE OR HELICOPTER.  I LIVE IN THE COUNTRY SO ANY NOISE WOULD HAVE BEE APPARENT.  I THEN WALKED OUT INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND LOOKED AROUND THE SKY ABOUT 3 - 5 MINUTES LATER I HEARD A SONIC BOOM OFF IN THE DISTANCE.  WHETHER THAT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE LIGHT, I DON'T KNOW.;30.7326;-96.0911
