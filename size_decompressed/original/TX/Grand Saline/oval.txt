As we took off for our first flight, the both of us we saw to the south these 25-30 white dots to the south moving to the north staying in a close formation.   The other drone operator went higher to maybe 400 feet, but the objects were still way up high.  At one point I saw a jet aircraft way up crossing the path of these dots, looked like a commercial jet but was really high up going to the east.   I moved up to around 400 feet, also, and tilted the camera up, but could not tell if I was getting any video on my Samsung Note 4 small screen I had from video.   I went and got my binoculars and it looks like golf balls.  They were moving to the north so I was able to turn my drone towards them and in the video recorded 1080HD.  My SD card played back on large screen, and you can see them right in through the propellers and right before they pass over another one comes from behind and catches up into the formation.   I have no idea what they were, but was really strange.   As they passed over us, they disappeared going to the north.
