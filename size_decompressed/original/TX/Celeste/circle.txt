Myself, sister, mother and father lived in the country.  I was six years old at the time.  We all went out to watch a craft in the night sky with different colored pulsating light on it.   Four jets tried to close in on it, but as soon as they got close enough it zig-zagged across the sky and disappeared so fast, it made the jets look like they were standing still.  Same thing happened the next two nights.   On that third night after going to bed, I awoke to a loud vibrating noise and extremely bright light coming in through all the windows.  My mother and father were  running around naked screaming.  That's all I remember.    I woke the next day feeling as if it was just no big deal.  Not even eventful enough to mention.  Years later I asked my mother about it.  She just stopped me before I even finished the question and told me she didn't want to talk about it.   My sister remembers it just as vividly as I do.;33.2643;-96.2078
