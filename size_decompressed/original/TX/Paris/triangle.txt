Triangle UFO with Blue/White lights;2002-10-12 20:00:00;5 Minutes;Triangle UFO with Blue/White lights I was driving south through Paris, Texas and I noticed a light coming from the west and as I kept driving it keep coming closer to me.  Then I saw it come into plain view and I stopped and it was about 50 yards from me just hovering there silently, above a resturaunt.  I got out a took pictures of it and as I did it started to slowly move west again and then it took a northwest approach and finally it was gone in a matter of seconds.  It was a black triangular one. It had two blue/white going from blue to white and one in the front that was just white.  I have black and white pictures of the craft but all you can see is the lights in the various positions that clearly make out that it was triangular.;33.6601695652174;-95.5305326086957
Close encounter in Paris, TX;2002-10-12 20:45:00;Less than 5 minutes;Close encounter in Paris, TX I was driving along South 271, and I was driving about 80 MPH. I live in Mount Pleasant, TX and I was driving back from visiting my realtives in Sallisaw, Ok. As I was driving on South 271 right outside of Paris, TX I saw some lights which at the time I thought was a plane, because an airport was nearby. As I kept driving the light was getting lower, and I thought it was a plane about to crash, but as I was slowing down my vehicle I noticed that the aircraft slowed down at the same pace as my vehicle. I made a complete stop on the shoulder of the road, and as I did the aircraft came to a complete stop. It was hovering over the Sandy Creek Cafe, and it was less than 15 yards from me. Luckily I had my camera because I'd been taking pictures of my relatives while I was in Oklahoma. The craft hovered over the Sandy Creek cafe for less than 5 minutes, it took off as I started taking pictures. The aircraft made a very low-tone humming sound, and I was able to make out its shape due to its lights. It was triangular because it had three lights on the craft, one for each end of the three sides. There was one light that flashed between blue and white, and the others were white. ---The pictures I took of the craft weren't very good. It was all black except for the lights. ---I also filed a report at the police station, and spoke to an officer who has had a similar experience. --Also, my cellular phone has never worked the same since.;33.6601695652174;-95.5305326086957

At about the same time she looked in that direction it simply blinked out or just disappeared. I watched the skies for a bit, in case it had merely moved but did not see it again.  We are on an elevated area east of downtown Paris it was too far away to gauge a size.  It would have fit into a circle of my closed-into-an-o fingers.;33.6601695652174;-95.5305326086957

I was east bound on 82 highway West of Paris Texas approximately 15 miles, a few miles west of the Maxey turnoff. There was a triangular shaped craft with a solid red light on each corner of the craft.  The craft looked to be solid and dark in color.  It was not large but not tiny either, I would say approximately the size of a room, maybe 12 feet in each direction.  It was hovering just to the North side of the highway and approximately 75 feet in the air.  There was no sound, it was silent. I was driving and was unable to get my phone out and take a picture, but it was dark enough outside that I donâ€™t think a picture would have been clear anyway.  As for how long it was there, I am unsure.  I saw as I was driving down the road and it was still visible in my rearview mirror until I was out of the area. I probably saw it for around 5 minutes between when I saw it ahead o! f me and when I could no longer see it after passing it. I messaged my adult son when I got home, and he suggested that I report the sighting.;33.6601695652174;-95.5305326086957
