Did anyone else see this;2008-03-24 17:38:00;10 seconds;Did anyone else see this MAR-24-2008 Around 5:38 pm today I was driving home when I noticed two airplanes flying fairly close to each other. I believe they where commercial liners, but I am not positive on that. While I was watching them, and trying to figure out why they were so close to each other, I saw a saucer shaped object suddenly appear to the south of them. The planes were flying west to east. I was driving east to west, so they were coming at me in clear sight. The object that I saw was hovering. Since the planes where moving, it was very clear that the saucer shaped object was sitting still. It remained in the same position for about ten seconds then disappeared in an instant (while I was looking at it) without a trace. At that point the planes sped up to a much faster speed then they where flying at before the object appeared.  This was in no way possible a reflection or gas vapors exploding from the sun. I saw a unidentified-flying-object - U.F.O;33.6601695652174;-95.5305326086957
