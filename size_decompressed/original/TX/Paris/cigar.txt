Feeling that a commercial aircraft may have been  in the process of, or might have crashed in a city close by, I hastily went back inside and told the elderly woman for whom I work to switch the television to one of the major local news stations to see what was causing the strange sight.  After hearing nothing on the news, I put the odd occurance out of my mind and continued with my work. At 11:00 I took my second break of the day and once again stepped outside. I looked at the sky and noticed an extremely unusual sight. Trails as of fighter jets littered an otherwise completely clear sky. confused, I stared at the trails trying to figure out which direction they were coming from. While I looked on, I noticed a cigar-shaped object  in the sky that was much higher than the jet trails I was seeing. I am sorry to say that I had only about 5 seconds in which to see this object and can give hardly any details about it's appearance. The object moved in a WSw direction and was, as best as I could tell, black in color.;33.6601695652174;-95.5305326086957
