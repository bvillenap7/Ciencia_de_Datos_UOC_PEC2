Thank you for reading this report and taking my claims seriously.;2016-08-16 21:30:00;3 seconds;Thank you for reading this report and taking my claims seriously. I was sitting on my front porch, as I was home alone at the time.  I look up from my cellphone at just the right time to see something very bright, but far away, and extremely fast.   The object looked spherical and bright green in color.  It looked very small considering how far into the sky it seemed to be.  It had a white circle in the middle of the bigger green coloring.   It took about three seconds for the craft to shoot all the way from the left, to the right side of the sky right in front of me.  It was far, far too fast to be anything built by modern humans.   It would be impossible, not to mention deadly, for a commercial aircraft or other human-developed device.  I would really like to know what it is I saw.   This is my first UFO encounter.
