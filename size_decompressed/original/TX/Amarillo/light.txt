I saw dancing round blue circles of light.;1993-03-20 02:00:00;? explanation below;I saw dancing round blue circles of light. At the time of the following occurrence, I was 43 years of age. I was and still am a school library clerk. I was traveling home to Lubbock, TX. I was traveling much later than I planned to be, because of car trouble near Oklahoma City. I have seen lights that I have wondered about and some strange things before and since this, but have never been sure enough to state that I thought I'd seen a UFO. Of the following I AM SURE: During March of 1993 I was traveling south on I40 at approximately 2:00 A.M.. I was about 5-10 minutes out of Amarillo, TX. To the left of the highway, I observed dancing, round, blue lights. They seemed to fill the skyline to my left. My best guess is that they were about half a mile away. There was nothing to compare the size with though, so I really have no way of knowing how far away or what size they were. Looking back, I really don't know why I was not alarmed by this. I was simply incredulous! It was such a beautiful and graceful display! They were too perfect and perhaps coordinated to seem anything but choreographed. I did not hear a thing. It never occurred to me to stop. I just kept on driving and eventually they were just gone. To this day, no one has taken me seriously. I know what I saw though. I have never found an explanation. I've also never heard anything of this description. Please believe me and perhaps tell me that I'm not the only one that has seen this. Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Date in March 1993 is approximate.

Stationary light;2000-01-09 23:00:00;ongoing;Stationary light In place now for about a week and a half..stationary light or maybe two. Appears in evening in Western sky...not always in the same place. Red and Blue lights rotating at bottom or middle.  Seems to be a dark aura of circular shape around this light.  Watched it depart one evening as it moved to the west...similar in description to the Arizona Lights. Considering location, maybe the same thing... ((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with a twinkling star, but that is a guess.));35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137

Sighting of several bright stationary lights and blue light at later time around same location.;2007-10-07 22:00:00;Random intervals;Sighting of several bright stationary lights and blue light at later time around same location. Sightings occur at certain nights in the same location at certain times. East of town near airport and Bell Helicoptor approx. 10-11pm. Myself and 2 others driving over bridge which gave us the chance of spotting them. One bright bright white light and a secong elevated slightly higher but not as bright. After approx. 5-6 min. of sitting still the smaller light darts directly toward the brighter larger light. Larger light grows slightly brighter and darts away into the sky while second light stays. Second light stays in position until we can no longer see the lights. Later on at approx. 3-4 am we are driving back into town, of course I'm all freaked so my eyes are on the sky. Me and driver (3rd person now at home) spot a dim blue glowing object moving slowly against the wind through the clouds.  After approx. 10 sec. it brightens slightly and we distinctly see the object dart through the clouds and into the sky. Seems as if these sightings occur only in those locations at certain times late at night. In my opinion it is impossible that they were planes due to their movement, appearance and behavior. Objects spotted near airport, Bell Helicoptor and Pantex so maybe they're OURS. Thank you for allowing me to report this sighting.

Flash Bulb like lights hovering at 100 ft over Hwy 287 outside of Amarillo;2008-06-30 23:00:00;10 minutes;Flash Bulb like lights hovering at 100 ft over Hwy 287 outside of Amarillo Last summer my family and I were driving thru Amarillo at 11pm on our way home to Dallas.   Just outside of town on Hwy 287, we were surrounded by at least a dozen flash bulb like lights that were hovering at maybe 100ft over the road and keeping pace with our SUV at 80mph.   One hovered silently right over our car, moving with us and as I watched it out the passanger window, it flashed like an old fashioned camera flash bulb when I was looking right up in to it.  It then crossed over the highway and headed back north.   The phenomenon lasted for at least 10 minutes.;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137
