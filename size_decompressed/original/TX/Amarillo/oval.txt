White oval shape flying saucer moving in variable directions at great speeds with stop and start features;2003-08-11 10:45:00;1-2 minutes;White oval shape flying saucer moving in variable directions at great speeds with stop and start features I was driving up Western Ave (Between I-27 and I-40) and approaching 45th ave. to turn west and saw a UFO which moved in a variety of irregular directions at great speeds.  I saw another one out of the corner of my eye on the east side of the road but was unable to gather details... when I turned back to see the first craft, it had dissappeared.  This is the first time I have ever seen a UFO.  This was during the daytime on a day that had very high visibility.  The craft was white.  It was very difficult to determine how far away it was... it could have been four miles or fifty or more miles away... difficult to determine the size... it was fairly small from the vantage point that I saw it, but visible enough to determine a flying saucer shape and perhaps the oval around it was not fully connected to the craft... it was too far away to make out clearly.  It may have left a little trail of something but not a clear trail.;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137
