Red light surrounded by a green light spinning around red. 2 side by side.;2014-09-25 00:30:00;1 minute;red light surrounded by a green light spinning around red. 2 side by side Driving eastbound I-40 30 miles west of Amarillo. Noticed 2 red lights in distance. Thought they were the tops of the wind generators in distance. They must have been a little different because they caught my attention.  My sister also saw them once I pointed them out. As they got closer a small green light was rotating around them, as they got closer the green light was brighter and spinning fast enough to leave a circle trace around the red light. I thought they were propellers spinning.  They were 50 - 100 feet up heading west. When they were almost over us I recognized a smoky haze inside of the circles they remained next to each other and could have been part of the same object.  I would approximate them at 10 - 20 feet in diameter green part and 1 foot or less diameter for the red portion in the middle. My sister saw blinking square red lights inside the red circles. It passed right over us and we could not track it because we were traveling 75 miles an h! our the opposite direction. It appeared to travel slow over us, but I could not gage because of the darkness.;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137

Bright reflective circular disk hovering above airplane traffic.;2020-06-13 20:13:00;1.5 hours;Bright reflective circular disk hovering above airplane traffic. Bright circular disk was observed hovering overhead higher than airplane traffic. The craft was presumably made of a reflective material as it grew dimmer with the setting sun. Craft hovered in place and slowly made its way south from north. Still visible until dark, so about 1.5hr. My daughter spotted the craft and my husband and I watched for a long time taking photos and videos. The zoomed photos show the circular shape and video shows the slow movement along with what appears to be circular energy movement around the craft.;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137
