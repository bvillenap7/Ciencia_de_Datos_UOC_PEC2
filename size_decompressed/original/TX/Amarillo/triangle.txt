This information come from my sister and it was on the news. A V shaped huge craft flew over silently with lights like in the Phoenix lights.  She stated it took several minutes to pass over Thompson Park and it covered the entire sky above them.  There were several people who saw the event.  It was a big news at the time.  They news stated that it was helicopters operating in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137

Overflight of three white luminescent delta shaped craft in a triangular formation.;2006-09-22 00:40:00;60 - 90 seconds;Overflight of three white luminescent delta shaped craft in a triangular formation. The city of Amarillo sits at about 3700' above sea level and if you are in an area where street lighting or other ambient lighting is somewhat blocked, the sky can be fairly dark for a metropolitan area. Such was the location of my sighting an east-west driveway that is bounded by a seven foot wood gate on the east, my house (roof height of 25' to 40' at its peak) along the south side, my neighbors 6' fence, house and 50' tree on the north side boundary, and the west side bounded by a stand of 30 -45' trees. My house sits in the east to west take-off flight path of our airport which is approx. 10 miles due east. Those planes are normally transiting a bit north of, yet parallel with this driveway. As an avid aviation buff since I was very young (my grandfather had a horse farm right across the highway from the now closed Amarillo Air Base which was a SAC installation), I am always checking the sky. On this particular night at 12:35 AM, I had taken my dogs out one last time for the night and I was standing in the driveway area that is darker than any other area around the north or west side of my house, perusing the sky. For whatever reason, I was looking straight to the east when I noticed three pinpoints of light emerging from the tree line of my neighbors house across the street (this would have been at an angle of about 20 degrees). These three points of light increased in size to the point where I could see that they were each delta shaped and were in a tight triangular formation as well. I was stunned that they were perfectly aligned with my driveway! At about 75 degrees I could see that the back edge of each delta shaped light was blurred. When these objects were directly overhead I would say that they were each about 1 1/2 width of a quarter. The formation remained tight until about 120 degrees (the objects were close to entering the west tree line boundary which would obscure my clear view) when the lights suddenly performed a shuffling move and regrouped into the same triangular formation. During the entire episode, I would say that each light's luminosity remained constant, only the relative size of the object/light increased and diminished as would be expected. Absolutely no noise whatsoever. One final kicker - as I was trying to figure the speed/altitude of the overflight and looking straight up from the same position - I saw a meteor streak from southeast to northwest and flame out right over my head! (obviou sly at a very high altitude because the streak was the length of my forearm and unobstructed by the roof line). Because of the manner in which the lights first appeared I was thinking that they could be at a fairly low altitude (5000 - 10,000'?), but at the overhead apex I just could not get a read. But I do estimate their speed to be at least 3-5 times faster than an aircraft if they were both at a relative cruising altitude. But I do have to emphasize the point that while this sighting was very exciting, the orientation of their east to west flight path right down the center axis of my driveway was astonishing!;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137
Two, maybe three, possible ufos of triangle shape- one of which was moving slowly.;2009-01-06 20:00:00;approx. two minutes;Two, maybe three, possible ufos of triangle shape- one of which was moving slowly. I believe I just witnessed two ufo’s. The first one I saw was close, triangular in shape, and was moving too slowly to be an airplane. It seemed to have three lights, one on each of the points, and then a couple more in the middle of the front.  I couldn’t get my palmcorder out fast enough to catch it on video and I was driving the opposite way of the direction it was traveling.  It seemed to be traveling in a north and then northwest direction. The second possible ufo, I got on video, but it was farther away and it looks like just a light on the recording.  I was traveling south on a straight road and you can tell it is not moving from side to side.  It was not getting fainter or brighter, so it must not have been moving towards me or away from me.  This leads me to believe that it was hovering. Something else I saw that could be something is hovering to the southeast of my house.  On the video I got of it, it brightens and darkens itself.  It seems to be stationery.  I must admit, I could just be excited about my previous sightings and it could be a planet or bright star that I have not previously noticed. I will take another video of the same area tomorrow night. I was driving when this all took place, save for the last possible incident, so if the crafts made any noise, I couldn't hear them. I cannot e-mail the videos because I can only e-mail up to 10mb, and both videos exceed that.;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137
11/10/2010 Unidentified Craft South Amarillo, TX;2010-11-10 21:40:00;1 minute 30 seconds;11/10/2010 Unidentified Craft South Amarillo, TX At approximately 9:40 PM. on the tenth of November 2010, a friend and myself were traveling south on S.Bell St. between Hollywood road and Interstate 27.  My friend and I were engaged in light conversation when he suddenly asked What kind of plane is that?. I looked through the front windshield of the vehicle and observed an object overhead with an orange light being emitted but could not identify it immediately.  The object was triangular with rounded edges and appeared to be traveling in a rough south-east to north-west direction moving over S.Bell St. toward I-27 and the Arden Rd.area. I rolled down the window and stuck my head out of the vehicle to get a better look at it and I observed the object to be flying low just over the power lines and moving rather leisurely and I at this point realized that the craft did not have wings or rotors or landing struts.  The object appeared to slow just long enough for me to study its underside and I observed tha! t the skin of the craft appeared beige in color and textured and the craft itself was about the size of a full moon if not slightly larger.  There was an individual non-blinking orange light illuminating the craft and the craft made no sound.  I noticed that the craft appeared to warble slightly as it followed its trajectory. I requested to my friend that we should follow it and he immediately turned right onto Ventura Dr and stopped. We both observed the back of the craft which was illuminated orange and observed it to move over I-27 and then slowly bank to the left behind a billboard and downward toward Arden Rd.  We lost sight of it at that point and continued on to our destination.  After we started our return home we briefly drove to where we thought the craft was trying to land and found nothing.  We placed a call, upon arriving back home to the local private airport, Tradewinds Airport, and inquired about light aircraft being in the area. We were told that they were ! unaware of any aircraft in the area in question.  They stated ! however that occasionally the Randall County Sheriffs Dept flies their helicopter with unusual lights equipped. The location of the sighting is on the southern edge of the city of Amarillo and there were street lights illuminating the road and a moderate amount of traffic on I-27 for that time in the evening.;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137
Triangle shaped craft with three lights or more.;2014-08-05 23:00:00;1.5 hours;Triangle shaped craft with three lights or more My girlfriend and I saw what appeared to be a star, that was moving erratically.  When it would come closer we could discern three lights.   Airplanes don't move like this object did, it was capable of high speeds and appeared to be doing half circles and zig zags overhead of where we were.   At times it would be still, but then it would begin to move again.   Very strange.  Indeed;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137

Four lights seen in morning sky.;2020-04-16 01:00:00;Few seconds;Four lights seen in morning sky. Early this morning, taking my dog out, I was observing the sky looking for satellites.  It was calm and clear.  I as was facing north and three white dots accompanied by a fourth were heading in a north west direction.  To me it seemed like a triangle with the fourth as an escort.  The color never changed, or blinked.  There was no jet trail, no noise.  They stayed in formation at a constant speed until they were out of my sight.  They were about the same luminosity as a star (but not as bright as Mars is right now in the morning sky.);35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137
