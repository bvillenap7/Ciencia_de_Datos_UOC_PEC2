Strange object and light;2006-06-10 23:45:00;3-5 seconds;Strange object and light I was sitting outside with my son and a neighbor when we noticed (to the direct east) a bright object speeding high across the night sky. It wasn't high enough to be a satellite, and to the best of my knowledge, all airplanes have blinking lights.  This object was not blinking.  It disappeared, possibly into some high clouds, though clouds were scarce that evening because we could see the stars quite clearly.  About a minute or two passed.  We were joking around and speculating the distance the object might have traveled over the time that had elapsed when suddenly a VERY bright light slowly blinked high in the sky- at the exact spot our rough calculations had placed the flying object.  It looked like a headlight that had turned on- then off.  It flashed once more and it was over.  Kind of like when kids are playing Morse Code with flashlights.  It was an alarming spectacle because the light was incredibly large for any object at that high of a distance-- and it was much, much larger than any light source that might come from an airplane.;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137
A Bright Lighted Object over Amarillo, Texas.;2009-07-14 13:00:00;1 1/2;A Bright Lighted Object over Amarillo, Texas. Every night I talk a walk with a Camra in case I see something,  So I was walking and then I sat down on a picnic table and looked up at the clear stary sky, So I started looking at this Bright light in the sky so I took a picture of it and then it looked like it was changing colors on me, So i kept looking at it for about an Hour and a half, so I went back home and put the pick on my Laptop as Background and when I looked at the picture it looked to be a small craft with two lights on the back of it.  Then I went back to the spot where I took the pic and the object was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
