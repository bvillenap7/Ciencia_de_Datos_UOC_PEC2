blueish silverish UFO felt like jello over Amirillo,Texas.;2006-03-23 15:30:00;20 seconds;blueish silverish UFO felt like jello over Amirillo,Texas. When my grandfather picked me up from Puckett Elementry School at 15:00 we went down Bell St. I noticed something silver and shiny, at the corner of my eye. I looked out the passenger side window and saw something rectangular about three feet away from me. I said  Papa look  and he said what? and then I felt it, it looked solid but felt like jello. I heard my voice singing a song that I had stuck in my head from quior that morning. Then I saw three lines that had looked a lot like the design on my shoes. My grandfather couldn't see it from where he was sitting (driving). I saw a square on top that was blueish and translucent. This is where I saw the lines that resembles on my shoe. Then it vanished very quickly from my sight.;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137
