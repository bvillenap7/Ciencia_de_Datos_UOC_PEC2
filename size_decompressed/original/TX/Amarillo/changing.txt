Strange Shape-Shifting UFO;2005-03-01 21:30:00;40 minutes;Strange Shape-Shifting UFO My friend and I were eastbound on I-40 when we saw a few interesting lights. There were two very bright lights on the end of this object, and one dim light in the middle. As we got closer to the object it appeared to be more triangular in shape. It then veered off to the north and revealed a fourth light, and when the fourth light became visible it looked like a kite the size of a B-52, possibly a little larger. When it was in this kite shape it appeared to be stationary.  We took the exit on Grand to get closer to it and get a better look. We went north and it then revealed a fifth light and we lost track of it very quickly as it headed east over a group of houses. We caught up with it again about a mile further east and it was in the triangular pattern again. We followed it going north for a while but took an eastbound road again to follow it more.  It was at this point that the object flew directly over our heads (the object was heading south), and when it did that it seemed to be 5 lights in a boomerang shape, the three leading lights were dim and the tail lights were extremely bright. while it flew overhead we stopped the car and rolled the windows down to see if it made any noise, and it did make a very odd sound.  The object then did an about face and started heading north again. We began moving further east as it did this, and  when it had gotten a couple miles north of us, it went back into the line pattern and landed, very shortly, and then took off again. We lost track of it for a short time after it took off again.  We caught up with it again going southbound on Lakeside, and it was in the boomerang configuration at this point, and we saw it going at an amazing speed in a southern direction. We were going about 70 miles an hour south, but it was almost overhead to nonvisible in a matter of seconds.;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137
