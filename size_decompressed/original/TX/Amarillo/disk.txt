Two low flying disk-shaped craft with porthole windows fly directly over witness' head.;1976-09-15 19:00:00;10 seconds;Two low flying disk-shaped craft with port-hole windows fly directly over witness' head. Just before sundown I saw something moving on the western horizon and jumped up to get a better look.  When the objects were about half way from the western horizon to my position I could see that they were disk shaped craft.  I was at the state fair and they flew silently almost directly over my position. Their altitude was quite low so at arms length they were about the size of a soda can bottom. I could see four round, port-hole windows on the bottom of each craft.  There was green light shining through each window like it was just the interior light and not a beam or external light.  The bodies of the craft were grayish, metal looking. Flying from horizon to horizon only took about eight to ten seconds and going that fast they were not stream-lined like one would expect but wobbled slightly from side to side like there was some sort of magnetic attraction-repulsion as they flew.  They were completely silent. There was a person walking close by when the craft were just overhead and I told him there were UFOs there and pointed up, but he purposely looked down, not wanting to be fooled.  Once the craft were out of sight, he looked up and not seeing anything he gave me a disapproving grunt like he knew there wasn't going to be anything!

Saw with naked eyes, football field sized ufo perform impossible maneuvers.;2008-08-12 13:00:00;3 minutes;Saw with naked eyes, football field sized ufo perform impossible maneuvers. Well it's been a few years.  I was driving flatbed truck west into Amarillo. I was about 10 to 11 miles out from city center when I saw ahead and slightly to the right over some radio towers about a mile high was this white glowing football shape.  More like an eye since the ends were sharp.   It just sat there over the towers for about 2 minutes and suddenly began moving left and right about 6 miles at a time in a fraction of a second.  It would get so fast that it would disappear and reappear in different spots.   Next it began doing that same maneuver but this time would move to and from over the freeway, over me.   Now I was having a hard time following it with my head out the window, and had giant rolls of aluminum on the flatbed I didn't want to run off the road with, so I stopped looking. The craft was no doubt as large if not larger than a football field.  I don't know what the date was I'm just guessing.  It's been a while.  Sky was clear, maybe 1 skinny cloud way off.;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137
Only seen on the photo I have.;2014-09-15 03:00:00;unknown;Only seen on the photo I have. The sighting I have is from my game camera on my place.  It it 22 miles north of Amarillo Texas an away from any electric power lines or houses.  I have the photo from my camera and would like to send it to someone but cannot find an e-mail address to send it. The light is seen over a buck deers back while he is feeding.  It appears it is directly above the deers back as the tree seen in the background is about 10 yeards from where the deer is standing. The stick with the stripes on it are one foot increments, so I can determine the size of the deer.  (I do not kill deer). ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a copy of the photo.

I noticed a bright or or Dick shape in the sky that hovered for about 5 minutes and than bobbed up and down moving back and forth and after 10 minutes of that it was just gone.  No zoom no noting,  just disappeared from sight. I heard no sounds to make me think it was a craft that was man made.;35.1691367454068;-101.883434908137
