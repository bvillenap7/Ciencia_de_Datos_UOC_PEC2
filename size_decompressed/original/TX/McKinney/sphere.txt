Red metallic sphere.;2017-07-13 07:51:00;3 minutes;Red Metallic Sphere On 07-123-2017 at approximately 0751, I observed a red “flash” from the corner of my eye.  Turning to face the flash, I observed a sphere, of unknown size, moving from West to East slowly across the sky.   The sphere moved in a straight line slowly, taking approximately 3 minutes to move 45 degrees in the arc of the sky. The sky was clear of clouds and there was no significant wind during this part of the morning, any wind which was moving was passing from South-East to North-West at somewhere less than 10 miles an hour. The only object which was in the sky at the time of the event which could be used as reference was the moon.  The object observed, appeared to be 1/16 of the diameter of the visible moon at the time with best estimate. The object appeared to be a metallic red color as it would catch sunlight and “flash” very brightly a red color.  This flash is what caught my attention in the first place.  In between the movements and the times the object flashed, it appeared to be either a dark colored, almost black or a diffuse white colored sphere.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
sphere moves South to North over McKinney, TX.;2019-11-18 03:52:00;~45 seconds;sphere moves South to North over McKinney, TX While walking my dog I decided to look up and try and locate the Pleiades and see if there were any late shower meteors.  As I scanned the sky, I observed a sphere approximately the size of a B.B. held at arms length moving above the high cirrus clouds in the area.  The sphere did not glow itself but was visible with a diffuse blue / white color.  The object appeared to move in a southerly to northerly direction, but not in a completely straight line.  There were stationary objects along the flight path of this object to judge movement and direction.  Occasionally during this objects movements it appeared to stutter (stop momentarily) for just a fraction of a second before continuing on its path. I have attempted to film the object, but the resolution on the video is too poor and even adjusting the gain and gamma corrections through editing software it is impossible to get anything viewable from it.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
