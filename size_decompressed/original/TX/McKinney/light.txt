As we were both watching this thing, it went due South over the horizon in a fraction of a second;2000-10-18 22:15:00;15 minutes;My wife and I were enjoying a glass of wine by the outdoor fireplace at approximately 22:15 on a cool clear fall evening. We live North of Dallas in McKinney Texas, with an unobstructed view to the South. I have grown up around aircraft and I am very knowledgeable about most types of air planes. Our house seems to be located in a position that gets a large amount of Care-Flight helicopters either directly over, or very near our location. We were watching the air traffic coming and going out of Love Field, DFW and Addison airport, always trying to figure out who was going where. We noticed what we assumed to be a Care-Flight or a private plane headed directly towards us from Love Field (due South). It was a bright red/orange light that resembled a bright landing light or a spot light on the front of a helicopter that was pointed towards us from a distance of approximately 10 – 15 miles and at a low altitude of 500 – 1500 agl (above ground level). After several minutes, we noticed that the aircraft never seemed to get any closer. At that time I got my binoculars out to get a better look at what was going on. The only thing that I could tell was that the red/orange light was all that I could see. I thought I should have been able to see a rotating beacon and anti-collision lights. After a total of approximately 5 - 6 minutes, the light moved due West. Now that I had what should be a side view of the craft, I knew that I could see the rotating beacon and the anti-collision lights. Not only were there no other lights, the spotlight seemed to still be pointed to the North. This is when we both knew we were seeing something that just wasn’t quite right. It was moving to the West at about the speed a fast moving helicopter would be going at a distance of about 5- 10 miles. After a few more minutes, it stopped again. Trying to rationalize what we were seeing, I thought a larger aircraft descending out of the South towards Love Field and then turning towards DFW (this may be possible due to the ru! nways at Love are 33 – 13 and DFW are 36 – 18), but we still couldn’t figure out why the light was that bright and moving that slow. The light was now standing still over DFW for another 4 – 5 minutes. As we were both watching this thing, it went due South over the horizon in a fraction of a second. After we could see the light move over the horizon, I had the feeling that the light was much larger and higher than what we had first assumed. I now believe it was approximately 5,000 agl, assuming that it was indeed over Love Field and DFW. The size of the light was approximately the size of a bb at arm’s length. The next morning we anxiously watched the news for a story on this light over Dallas, there was no mention of anything. I called the towers at Love Field, DFW and approach control via land line and no one knew anything about what we had witnessed the night before. I just pray that it was ours.

Fast Moving Green Light;2005-06-25 00:00:00;Seconds;Fast Moving Green Light I had just laid down to go to sleep when a very bright greenish light flooded my bedroom. At first I thought it was a car but then opend my eyes because it did not move for a few seconds. My whole room was lit up by a green light that I had never ever seen before in the 7 years that I have lived there. I few seconds later it jetted across Very fast to my other window and beyond. I have blinds on both windows in my bedroom so I couldn't see what it looked like, but it wasn't natural. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Conspicuous Lights seen in Night Sky over McKinney, Texas;2007-12-31 18:00:00;5 minutes;Conspicuous Lights seen in Night Sky over McKinney, Texas During several nights in the week ending 4 January 2008, I have seen very bright lights over the different locations in McKinney, Texas. Since this area is in the landing path for DFW airport, I was not initially alarmed by what I saw. The objects were visible due west from a position located near 33.23 N by -96.68 W. I studied the objects with binoculars, comparing their distance to landmarks, and determined by their orientation to those landmarks, as well as compass readings, that they were not aircraft in the landing path. After several minutes of careful observation, it was determined they were fixed. Five minutes later, one of the objects changed its position. Then, another. Eventually, all three objects departed.  On 3 January, another set of lights was seen over a different part of the city. From a closer vantage point, it was clear the object was hovering over the east side of US75, possibly 2KM, near US380.  My first impression of these objects was that they were helicopters performing some sort of high-altitude scanning. It is unusual to see helicopters flying so high, especially when they are stationary. The lights, again, were very bright, similar to the landing lights of large commercial jets. Indeed, they were even discernible against the brightness of the western sky just after sunset. The lights did not appear to be flashing from any place on the aircraft.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
Moving star sighted over McKinney Texas at 20:30 moving from the northwest to the southwest.;2008-10-09 20:30:00;2/3 minutes;Moving star sighted over McKinney Texas at 20:30 moving from the northwest to the southwest. At about 8:30 PM US Central Time I observed from my backyard what appeared to be a moving star moving across the sky from the northwest to the southwest over a duration of about two to three minutes in McKinney, TX. The object in question appeared to be a white light whose intensity matches that of a bright star. The object moved relatively fast however not so fast that this factor in and of itself made me suspect that what I observed might be of unknown origins. The most significant detail of this experience was the absence of any blinking or otherwise red/green lights on the sides of the object as would identify a passenger jet. Furthermore the object made no noise yet it flew at an altitude that seemed to be characteristic of that of a plane that might be leaving or landing at DFW International Airport (relatively low). As the object flew from the northwest to the southwest it became smaller and smaller and dimmer and dimmer eventually to the point that I could no longer see the object in the southwestern sky. The object seemed to maintain a relatively constant speed throughout the sighting and flew in more or less a straight line. I would also like to add that McKinney has an airport that is used primarily for smaller personal/privet aircrafts. My mother also witnessed the object with me and see believes she saw a second moving object in the west that matched the description of the first, however, she lost sight of the object and was only able to watch it for a few seconds.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
Two White Separated Lights in Southern Sky;2008-10-12 20:00:00;5 minutes;Two White Separated Lights in Southern Sky McKinney, Texas Sunday night, October 12th, 2008. Time: 8:00 pm I went outside with dog and noticed what appeared to be two round lights very close together in the southern sky.It looked like there was separation between the two white lights.The moon was nearly full in the eastern sky and these two lights really were bright like a planet,much brighter than any stars.Not sure what is was.I watched for five minutes and showed my son and wife.Didn’t appear to be moving.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
2 bright lights in the sky, no other stars visible and planes deviated flight path around them.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus & Jupiter.  PD));2008-11-27 18:30:00;An hour or 2;Two bright lights in the sky, no other stars visible and planes deviated flight path around them Around 6:30 - 7:00pm after we ate dinner.  A family friend who tends to stare up at the sky while he smokes outside called to our attention to bright lights in the cloudy sky to the south-southwest of highway 5 and 380 in the general direction of Dallas.  One was very bright and was accompanied by a lesser shining light above and to the left of it like (\) this. They both shined white and were the ONLY things visible in the sky. It was too cloudy and too bright out for any stars to be seen. They kept falling out of our view due to passing clouds but did not move in the sky and did not have any tails or trails. Another important note of this is that the flight path of commercial planes coming down toward DFW airport was smack right in the middle of the two lights. Several planes took the standard flight path but after a while the planes DEVIATED their flight paths to the west of the lights and avoided them completely. Tonight we stood outside and looked for anything. The stars have been visible but we DID NOT see anything near where we saw the two lights and the planes that regularly pass are back on the normal flight path. (We saw 4 or 5 planes go straight through the area where they had been flying between the lights yesterday night so we k now that must be their standard flight path.)  Several other people including some other friends and family saw it as well and acknowledged that the lights seemed strange seeing as there were no visible stars yesterday (Nov.27) where we were.

Then a bright white light in the shape of a ball with a trail streaked through the open sky and disappeared.  It was too large and close to be a shooting star.  Also the bright light shining through the tree made it obvious that the object was close.  There was no sound of either the object in the sky or of it colliding to the ground.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
High altitude light.;2016-07-19 20:16:00;~3 minutes;High altitude light On 7-19-2016, on or about 20:16 hrs (CDT), while taking a break outdoors and watching a single engine plane doing “touch and go’s” from a nearby airstrip, I noticed a fairly bright white light approximately the size of or a little larger than a “BB” if held at arm’s length. The object was well above the local commercial air traffic, appearing at least as high as passing cirrus clouds and moved in a straight line from East to West.  The observation lasted at least approximately three minutes and during this time, the object never seemed to change brightness, size, shape, or color. When I first noticed the object, it was approximately at the 10 or 11 o’clock position in the sky and remained visible until approximately the 2 o’clock position before fading out.  If holding my hands at arm’s length, the object would have been about three to four hands high off of the horizon. Shortly after the object moved out of view, I observed two passing commercial aircraft in landing pattern and observed the glint from any reflective surfaces on them for comparison neither of the craft had the same reflective luminosity of the object I had observed a few minutes earlier.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
Light moving N to S over McKinney.;2016-10-09 01:05:00;5-7 seconds;Light moving N to S over McKinney At approximately 0105, while walking my dog, I observed a single point of light  approximately the same size and brightness as the stars visible in Orion and being white in color.  This light traveled from North to South in a straight line, leaving no trail and making no noticeable sounds.  The light did not change shape or color.  I was not able to track the final destination of the object due to trees blocking my view.   When I arrived back home, I looked up the ISS and any satellite which may have passed over the area and there is not a listing of any object transiting at the time on this date and at that time.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
Four to six light clusters in eastern sky.;2016-11-20 00:00:00;2 hours;four to six light clusters in eastern sky While on a family walk in McKinney, Texas, at 8 pm, November 20, 2016, the two adults noticed a faint cluster of four to six blinking lights in the eastern sky about sixty degrees from the horizon.  They appeared to have coloration of green, white, and blue hue.  The objects seemed to move.   There were three children ages, 10–14 who also witnessed the cluster.  They walked to their home still observing the cluster.   The grandmother then observed the cluster and being a retired, science teacher she immediately confirmed that this was a unique phenomenon.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983

I was unloading fire wood with 2 of my roommates.  I stopped in our backyard to smoke a cigarette and I looked up.  I saw a craft about as high as the lowest clouds in the night sky because the light would sometime go behind some clouds.  It was darting in every direction but did not travel to far away and would always come back directly over my house.  I have a short video of the main craft.  During the 3 hours about 3 or 4 appeared to be emitted from the first ufo but the main craft never faded away like the others.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
