Large string of light move slowly from west to east, very low and silent;1991-07-15 02:30:00;10 Minutes;Large string of light move slowly from west to east, very low and silent It was late at night, early morning, me and my cousin were outside playing.  My cousin said what is that, so I turned around and looked up in the sky.  I saw an airplane pretty high in the sky and said an airplane and turned back around and he said no look lower.  I turned around again thinking he was pulling my leg, but this time I had to look for a second and then I could see it.  It was very low to the ground, maybe 150 yards up and very close to us.  The first thing we did was run to it.  It was moving very slowly from West to East.  It blended in with the night sky, with a few exceptions.  We ran directly beneath it and looked up at it.  It stayed at a constent speed, very slow.  It was long, about 50 yards from our view point, looked like a string of lights or string of stars moving through the sky. The one way to know for sure that there was something there was to look at the stars in front of it, while we were beneath it and watch it move over them, the stars would disappear and the lights that looked like stars would just be moving along at the same speed.  It looked to me like it was reflecting the image of the stars above it to the bottom of it.  Some of the lights would twinkle a little.  I seam to remember som kind of round windows on the side but am not sure.  I could not tell the exact shape since it was the exact same color.  You could tell that it was one very big object and it was silent.  It didnt slow down or speed up, we walked under it for about 10 blocks until the T in the road.  We watched it slowly go over the factory at the end of the road and went back to the house. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
Bright light near Dallas.;2006-07-26 22:30:00;1 minute;Bright light near Dallas. Saw bright light in sky over Dallas area, This was in eastern sky. The light was moving in direction from DFW toward like the Florida region. The light caught my eye as I was speaking with another person. It was bright like an airplane landing light. But the object was moving away from my location. The initial light only lasted seconds then dimmed. But still visible like a star, still moving I watched for about 1 minute. Then about 20 minutes later I saw another object tracking in the same path, but without the initial brightness as the first. My assumption either UFO or satellites.

One large UFO and 4-5 objects surrounding the area hovering in the NE sky.;2007-03-01 22:30:00;30 may still be out there;One large UFO and 4-5 objects surrounding the area hovering in the NE sky. Went out side to view the sky. Looked to my NE and noticed one star kept looking and noticed 4-5 object around this star.  As I looked closer (trying to gain focus in shock) I noticed they would fade out and come back but going in a random motion.  The bigger one would stay in one stop but the other 5 would just move around it.  As no shape would take place or path.  Almost like they were refueling or hovering in that one area.  Walked away for about five mins thinking that I am seeing things.  Still there.  If a plane would go close by they would stop flashing lights and almost combine into one object into the bigger one.  Strange, when the plane would pass by they would all seperate and fade in and out again.  The light was a white light with a tint of green here and there.  The shape couldnâ€™t say, I would say circle but it was too far away.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
Upon closer inspection of the picture;2010-06-29 20:00:00;Unknown;Upon closer inspection of the picture I took this on June 29th, 2010, as I was leaving Kroger.  It was crazy, the sky turned purple, the wind picked up, it got cold, I thought there was going to be a tornado for sure.  Well upon inspection of the photo the next morning, there is something else in the picture.  At first I attributed it to the zoom and me moving a little bit, but I can tell that I wasn't moving that much because you can tell by looking at the Kroger and Starbucks signage.  Look above the Starbucks sign, in the darker purple area just above the lighter purple, there are 3 green lights.  You cant miss them.  It's not a glare, because I was standing outside and there was not a car driving toward me.  Anyway, I'm not saying it was a UFO, but I am saying it is weird!;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
