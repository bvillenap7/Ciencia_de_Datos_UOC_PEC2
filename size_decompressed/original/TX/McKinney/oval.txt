Bright Oval White Light Moving Super Fast Speeds East of Mckinney Texas;2007-07-19 23:19:00;4 Seconds;Bright Oval White Light Moving Super Fast Speeds East of Mckinney Texas 11:19pm CST July 19th 2007    Standing on my sidewalk smoking a cigarette. My body was facing the Eastern Hemisphere. A bright oval white light seemed to be moving from East to West towards me. Then it rapidly took a turn to the south(right) very quickly as if it was turning on a dime. I saw this object for about 4 seconds.  The object was definitely some sort of aircraft but I know airplanes and it was no airplane nor was it a star. The object seemed to be no further then 25 miles away and was very large in shape. It was a oval shape and very bright white light. To my guess and I know approximately how fast government aircraft moves and I would to say this object looked to be moving 8,000 to 10,000 miles per hour.  I immediately came inside and wrote down the exact time according to my cell phone and date. Then I went to Google and found your site in order to report this.

((HOAX))  Erratic flying UFO with meteor like shape and several lights flies over Mckinney, TX;2009-06-09 00:30:00;15 Seconds;Erratic flying UFO with meteor like shape and several lights flies over Mckinney, TX I was out back of my friends house, located in Mckinney, Texas.  I was on the far side of his lawn when i saw an oval, meteor-like object flying through the air.  It looked rocky in formation from my perspective.  I immediately hurried to get my camera phone out.  The object had over 5 yellow lights omitting from it in a symmetrical manner.  It was flying from side to side in an erratic way.  I could not get my camera to function in time to catch record of the UFO before it sailed over the trees.  It seemed to be flying at about the altitude of a low flying plane.
