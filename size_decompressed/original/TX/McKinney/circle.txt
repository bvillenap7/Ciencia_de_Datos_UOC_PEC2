Orange ball of light.;2011-07-01 23:00:00;30 seconds;Sitting out in the backyard visiting, around 11 PM, daughter looked up in the sky and questioned what she was seeing?   An orange ball of light appeared & seemed to fly, almost glide in the same manner as an airplane might, but the light seemed to fly very smoothly.  The ball of orange light had a starburst effect at times. For verification, daughter said to mom, look up quickly and tell me what you see.  She said, I see it ... and the direction it was headed was Northwest (toward Hwy 380).   We only spotted it for a short time & then the light flickered out once, then the second time, it completely went out.    Mom & daughter were so baffled -- the duration only lasted approximately 30 seconds.   It never made a sound. Since we live in a flight pattern to D/FW Airport, it was evident that this was no plane because about 5 minutes after spotting this UFO, an airplane flew over.  The major difference was there were no red or white lights blinking like on the bottom of an airplane. This was the first time daughter had witnessed anything like it! And there was no alcohol or drugs involved.  And it was NOT fireworks (close to 4th of July weekend).;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
Two large, bright lights traveling east to west extremely fast and just disappeared.;2014-07-12 21:10:00;5 seconds;Two large, bright lights traveling east to west extremely fast and just disappeared. I was sitting on my front porch and looking to the South, two very bright circles, one on top of the other about 3 feet apart, came from the East and were traveling extremely fast to the West.  The two circles were traveling parallel to the ground.   They were about the size of a volleyball, and were a very bright white/light.  They weren't flashing or blinking at all, there wasn't a sound, then the one on top accelerated, the one on bottom appeared smaller, then the one on bottom caught up with the one on top and they seemed to touch, the one on top appeared to travel up slightly then it vanished, at the same time the one on the bottom just disappeared.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983

When looking to the west over my back fence I noticed a strange bright light.  It was significantly brighter than other stars in the sky and was not moving like an airplane.  It was the only strange object that I noted.  Other lights in the sky appeared to me normal stars and an airplane.  I have video of it along with with it zoomed in.  I also tried to get video of other stars to show the contrast and have a second video where there is a plane in the sky and I then show this strange light.  When zoomed in it appears to be a circle that appears to be spinning.  But I recorded it on an apple iPhone 8 Plus.  I then went out about 3 hours later and took a quick video to show that the light is no longer present.  After my initial video I didnâ€™t stay and watch it.  So I do not know exactly when it disappeared but it was gone 3 hours later and I have a short video to show that.  I also have some pictures as well as the 2 videos noted.;33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
