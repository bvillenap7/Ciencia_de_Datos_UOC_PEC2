Rectangle of red and green lights loudly flew over the sky.;2014-08-13 02:05:00;20 seconds;rectangle of red and green lights loudly flew over the sky We were trying to watch a meteor shower when we heard a loud noise that sounded like a motorcycle on the street right behind my house.   The noise just continued to get louder and louder when we saw green and red lights shining over the trees that back my fence.  Soon over the sky we saw something that looked like a rectangle, with a strand of white lights going through the middle and then red and green lights on the side.   It was fairly close to the ground.  It just flew by. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.1909000000009;-96.6197999999983
