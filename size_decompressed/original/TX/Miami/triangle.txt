My friend and I were driving in my '96 dodge ram sport southeast towards Miami, TX on farm to market road 283.  About three hand spaces above the horizon I noticed three iridescent orange lights in a triangle shape.  They were very slowly changing from orange to green.  They hovered where they were for approximately two minutes when my friend asked if I was seeing what he was seeing. I said yes, and then we started trying to see if they were reflections from some lights in the pickup cab.  I hung my head out the window and the lights were still in the same position.  They seemed to be rotating clockwise very slowly, almost imperceptibly.  We both watched them for another minute or so when they disappeared.  My friend thought they just blinked out, but I thought I saw them zoom away to the northeast at a speed that made them seem like they disappeared.  The lights never really did change colors completely to green but seemed to shimmer and have a green tinge.;35.7193;-100.7027
3 white lights in the shape of a triangle, observed for 5minutes;2015-03-13 21:30:00;5 minutes;3 white lights in the shape of a triangle, observed for 5minutes I was about a mile south on TX hwy 70 from the FM 283 turnoff.  I was at work on an oil well.   What I saw was 3 white lights in the shape of a triangle with a red flashing light in the center.   It was traveling in an easterly direction.  From my prospective, it seemed to be moving slower than an airplane.   I've been working on night shift for almost 6 years and this is the 1st time that I have ever seen anything like that.;35.7193;-100.7027
