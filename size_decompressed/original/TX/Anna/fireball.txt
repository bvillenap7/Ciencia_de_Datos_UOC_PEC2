Fiery, glowing, completely disappeared;2013-07-28 20:25:00;10 seconds;Fiery, glowing, completely disappeared At 8:25 P.M., I was smoking a cigarette on the porch, and looked up to see a red, brightly glowing ball moving at a steady pace across the sky.  It caught my attention because the object was obviously not a plane as opposed to the flashing lights and shape of a plane, the object I witnessed did not flicker and was fiery in appearance.  The sighting did not last long. The object started to fade and dim before disappearing completely from sight.  It absolutely vanished.  I kept watching for a couple minutes afterward to verify this, and never saw it reappear nor did I see any aircraft at any distance from the sighting.;33.3438000000001;-96.5635000000001
