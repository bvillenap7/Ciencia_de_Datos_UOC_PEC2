dark triangle no lights or sound;2006-04-22 21:40:00;10 seconds;dark triangle no lights or sound object was delta or triangular shaped , much like a bomarang. It was moving at a slow but steady pace south to north. It had no lights nor was there any sound coming from it. Estimated to have been about 5 to 8 K feet in altitude. The delta wing shape was the only part of the craft visible, no specific body or tail. It seemed to resinate against the black sky backround. Totally clear sky away from bright city lights. I am a science teacher and the co-observer is also a teacher. I have had one other sighting in my life which I cannot explain. I tend not to believe in the UFO / aliens from outer space genre, but I do believe in what my eyes see! I was not drinking alcohol at the time of this sighting, in fact we were watching for shooting stars staring at one fixed point in the night sky. This craft flew directly over us with no sound or lights of any kind.;33.3438000000001;-96.5635000000001
