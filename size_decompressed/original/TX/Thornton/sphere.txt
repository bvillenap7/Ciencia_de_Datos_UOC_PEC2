We viewed this evenly rising dome bathed in blue violet for approx. 1.5 sec. before it vanished.  Our first thoughts where a nuclear detonation or natural gas explosion.  The diameter was about 3 dia. of the moon which was to the East. Est. distance away, 10 miles to hundreds. No sound or shockwave.  The light lite up 1/2 of the sky. Size of dome 1000s of feet to miles across. We thought at that moment people must of been killed because of the shear energy of such an event, something this large and bright must of has huge amounts of energy inside.  It remains a mystery to me what it was.;31.4067;-96.5021
