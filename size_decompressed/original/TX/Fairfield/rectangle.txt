A rectangular object with reflective illumination travels accross the sky;1978-06-01 23:00:00;2-3 seconds;A rectangular object with reflective illumination travels accross the sky I was riding my bike home from a friendâ€™s house on the east side of Fairfield.  Stopping to turn at an intersection, I noticed what I thought was a meteorite.  The kind at high altitude that appears and disappears without slowing down.  It had the same speed and illumination of a meteorite moving from overhead to the southwest.  The distinctive features that set it apart is that it traveled without a streak behind it.  It was an object that was rectangular in shape with straight edges and defined corners.  Because of the distance, size could not be determined.  However the height to length ratio was approx. 1 to 5.  The last feature of the object is that the side opposite from the west horizon was concaved.  I attribute this feature to being the shaded side of the object.  There were no other features observed.;31.7384;-96.1566
