We watched it while driving for about 20 minutes then it began to drop quickly.  We then decided to video it and zoom in on it.  When we zoomed in, the shape seemed diamond but with what looked like many round lights in it. Then it changed into a thin, oblong shape that seemed to split into two parts and make other shapes- almost like symbols.  We stopped the truck and put the camera on the dash and watched the said object jump in, out, and all around the screen.  It would then return to the diamond shape. It changed shape many times. We videoed the object for 27 minutes before it quickly became smaller and disappeared.   After watching the tape at home, we realized the object was not shaped like a diamond, but more like a spinning toy top is shaped.  It would also seem to pulsate at different times, but only when it was in this shape.;31.7384;-96.1566
