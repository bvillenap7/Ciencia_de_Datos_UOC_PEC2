Red glowing oval object with whitish blue halo effect Southwest of Fairfield, Freestone County observed for 20 minutes;2008-10-28 20:20:00;13 minutes;Red glowing oval object with whitish blue halo effect Southwest of Fairfield, Freestone County observed for 20 minutes This is the second sighting in one week here in Freestone County. Because of the October 21st sighting, we have been very alert and scan the skies nightly. On the evening of Tuesday, October 28th 2008 I went out on our back porch to give a treat to our dogs. I looked up in the South West sky and observed a large glowing orange/red object. It was not as bright as the stars and much bigger to the naked eye. It had no blinking lights like an aircraft so I called out to my boyfriend to come outside and take a look. He came out, took one look and said to record exactly what time it was (8:20 PM), he then went inside and retrieved a rifle with a high powered scope and we began to watch this thing through the scope. We live on a ranch so we have open views and dark sky. This object floated or hovered for 13 minutes before descending or headed away so that we could not see it, although with our naked eyes it looked like it descended somewhere in the Jewett Mine area. While watching it through the scope, we saw that it was emitting a faint white or bluish glow at varying times. It was very strange. We are now convinced that something is going on over the Central skies of Texas. Please, please investigate and do not let this be explained away by military testing etc... I reported this sighting to MUFON and was contacted by an investigator. I cannot stop thinking about what we have seen the last two weeks.;31.7384;-96.1566
