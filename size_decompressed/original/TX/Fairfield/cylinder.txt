A cylinder object with red and turquoise colors that had been moving back and forth, then stationary.;2000-08-20 06:00:00;1 1/2 hrs.;A cylinder object with red and turquoise colors that had been moving back and forth, then stationary. It was a clear, early morning, with stars out. My friend has already been watching it for about a hour before I got to his house to go fishing.  He told me he had watched it zip back and forth (east to west), quite a bit, but that it had been stationary for around thirty minutes before I got there.  Just looking up in the sky at it, it looked like two stars, one on top of the other.  When I looked through his binoculars, I was really surprised!! I had never seen anything like it!  It was a bright red and turquoise! (bluegreen)  It was kind of flickering the colors, and I didn't know if it was me moving the binoculars a little or if it was kind of jiddering a little.  I watched it a few minutes then brought down the binoculars.  I could still see a flash of red and then turquoise.  It was only one object and my friend said it was shaped like a bracelet.  He could observe it closer when he watched it zipping back and forth with the binoculars.  We were in town, but the object was at a 45% angle to the east (kind of south too), which would have placed it over wooded areas.  There's a river east of us about 20 miles....don't know if it might have been over it or not. Best I recall, there was red on the top and bottom, and the turquoise color was in the center.  It didn't effect us other than fascination!  I'm 51, and I've NEVER seen anything like it before!  Wish I knew if others had.  I watched it till daylight, then I couldn't see it any more. ((NUFORC Note:  Ordinarily, our first assumption in a case like this would be that the witness is reporting a twinkling star.  However, twinkling stars do not move across the sky in the manner described here.  We do not know what the witnesses saw.  PD));31.7384;-96.1566
