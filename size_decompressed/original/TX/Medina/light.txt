WHILE SETTING UP LIGH;1999-06-05 23:30:00;20min;ON JUNE 5,6,7 I WAS ON A LEADERSHIP CAMP WITH ABOUT 85 CHILDREN AT CAMP CORPUS CHRISTI 2 MILES WEST OF MEDINA TX. WHILE SETTING UP LIGHTS NEAR THE FEMALES RESTROOMS I AND OTHERS NOTICED A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT OVER US.  I HAD ALREADY SEEN THE SAME LIGHT BEFORE ON THE 5TH AND MANNAGED TO GET BOTH EVENTS ON MY HI-8MM CAMCORDER. MYSELF TWO VOLUNTEERS AND ABOUT 5 FEMALE CHILDREN WITNESSED THE EVENT. HELLO MY NAME IS JOE ROGERIO.  I USED TO WORK FOR THE SOUTH TEXAS COUNCIL ON ALCHOL AND DRUG ABUSE (STCADA) AND DURING A LEADERSHIP CAMP WITH ABOUT 85 STUDENTS IN CAMP CORPUS CHRISTI NEAR MEDINA TEXAS I AND OTHERS WITNESSED STRANGE OBJECTS IN THE SKY AND OTHER REPORTS BY CHILDREN THAT NIGHT. IT ALL STARTED ON THE 4TH OF JUN 99 WHEN MYSELF AND OTHER CO-WORKERS WERE GOING TO CAMP CORPUS CHISTI TO SET UP THINGS FOR THE CAMP. I HAD GOTTON THERE EARLIER THAN THE OTHERS AT AROUND 1:30PM FROM KERVILLE,TX. THE CAMP WAS BEAUTIFUL AND WAS AWAY FROM ANY BIG CITIES. LATER THAT EVENTING AT AROUND 11:20 WHILE WALKING TO THE MALE RESTROOMS OUTSIDE I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT OVER ME. I THOUGHT IT WAS VENUS BUT IT WAS TOO LATE FOR THAT. THE LIGHT BEGAN TO MOVE VERY SLOWLY TOWARD THE WEST. I THEN RAN TO MY TRUCK TO GET MY VIDEO CAMERA AND THEN MANAGED TO FILM IT FOR ABOUT 25MIN. UNTIL MY CO-WORKERS SHOWED UP FROM LAREDO WITH ALL THE SUPPLIES. I THEN HAD TO MEET THEM BECAUSE I WAS THEN ON WORK TIME. THE NEXT NIGHT WAS CLOUDY AND NO LIGHTS WERE SEEN. THE FOLLOWING NIGHT WAS THE BEST. AFTER MY BOSS TOLD ME SO SET UP SOME SPOT LIGHTS BEHIND THE GIRLS CABINS I NOTICED THE SAME LIGHT IN THE AIR. I THEN SAW TWO KITCHEN COOK VOLUNTEERS AND CALLED THEM OVER. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A STAR BUT A INSISTED IT WAS NOT AND THAT IT WAS A UFO. THE OBJECT THEN STARTED TO MOVE VERY SLOWLY TO THE WEST AND THATS WHEN THE COOKS UNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS SEEING. THEN SOME YOUNG GIRLS WERE COURIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE WERE SEEING. THEY MANANGED TO SEE THE OBJECT LIGHT INTENSIFY AND DIM. WE THEN TOLD THE OBJECT IN OUR MINDS TO DO SOME MANOUVERS. IT MOVED TO THE RIGHT AND THEN LEFT. DURING ALL THIS TIME I CAPTURED ALL THE EVENT ON TAPE. LATER THAT NIGHT MY BOSS AND I SAW A BLINKING LIGHT STEAK ACROSS THE SKY AT AN UNBELIEVABLE SPEED. IT CROSSED THE WHOLE SKY IN LESS THAN 3 SEC WHILE WE SAW THE STROBE LIGHT UP. THE ORIGINAL LIGHT THAT WE SAW WAS STILL IN THE SKY IN A DISTANCE AND WAS NOT MOVING. MY BOSS SAID IT WAS JUST A STAR. BUT MINUTES LATER IT HAD MOVED DIRECTION AND MY BOSS WAS FREAKING OUT. IN THE MORNING I NOTICED THAT SOME OF MY FEMALE CO-WORKERS SAID THAT THEY HEARD THIS LOUD CRASH AT NIGHT AND A LITTLE BOY SAID HE SAW SOMEONE CARRYING A DEER. I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THERE ARE UFO'S OUT THERE. AND ALSO THINK THEY ARE AROUND THAT AREA. IF YOU WOULD LIKE A COPY OF THE VIDEO PLS GET IN TOUCH WITH ME. THANKS ((name deleted));29.8489;-99.3249
