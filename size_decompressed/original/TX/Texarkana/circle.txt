BRIGHT blue neon light going across sky(no streaks) and about the size of three stars.;2002-03-30 21:00:00;1 minute;BRIGHT blue neon light going across sky(no streaks) and about the size of three stars. Bright blue NEON light.  High in the air, and was brighter than any light seen on aircraft, like the light seen on cars(those very blue BRIGHT lights) but up in the air and was about the size of three stars(from point of view) and was a few thousand feet in the air. Flew over Texarkana College(I was outside of the Library but no one was around me). I was ((deleted--senior officer)) of the ((deleted--religious group/facility)) so this is all based on my point of views. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

I saw a UFO without a doubt a UFO!;2004-12-18 05:30:00;1 hour;I saw a UFO without a doubt a UFO! This occured on Wright Patman lake this morning Dec 18 2004. After setting up decoys for the morning hunt I sat down in the blind to get my shells and gloves out. It was clear this morning so I was looking at the stars. Directly to the west of me was what looked like a star but it was a yellowish color and the light refracted different on the water, then it moved. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but it began moving faster in random directions, up, down, side to side but it always came back to the same general area.I was freaked out and by my self without a camera and knew no one would beleive me. My hunting buddy was supposed to show up at anytime and I kept hoping it would hang around for him to see and it did. I watched it for a good 45 min before he showed up then we watched it another 30 before it was daylight. It was definalty NOT an airplane. I would have given anything for a camcorder this morning.  ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  If the object was, in fact, in the western sky, it could not have been Venus, which is in the eastern morning sky, currently.
