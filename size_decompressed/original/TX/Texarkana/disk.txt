Spun horizontal, vertical and than diagonally. At around 10:22pm on May first in Texarkana, Texas, over our subdivision,  a Ufo or several small ufos were seen.  It was dark outside and 2 females and 1 male reported hearing the sound resembling a very high powered vacuum cleaner with aquatic noises bwoop Bwoop coming from the craft or crafts.   At first it appeared to be one set of lights after a few minutes more lights were seen forming in formation as if a very large disc miles wide in the night sky.  At first the object spun horizontal, changing to vertical and than on a diagnol.  It stayed in view hovering over the neighborhood for about 35 minues before completely disappearing all at once.  Video tape could not produce an image as if it was incapable of being filmed.  Perhaps beyond the light spectrum of our camera phone.  It was verified by two additional males that also saw the object.  All onlookers were terrified.  All Normal aircraft were ruled out.  Not saying this couldn't of been a! government spy craft of new type. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Possible hoax??
