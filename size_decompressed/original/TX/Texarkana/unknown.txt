This started last summer,I contacted Mufon,they are some sort of object with red,bluish green,and amber lights going around on these things,tonight May 8th I counted seven,sitting on my back porch I can see these things, using my binoculars I can see the lights well.  There are also swirling lights with a pinkish purplish hue, it seems as if the sky is a veil and they are underneath it!  This is perplexing!I also contacted Mr. Walter Sheets, ((NUFORC Note:  Mr. Walter Sheets is the former (??) State Director, and experienced investigator, for the Mutual UFO Network in the State of Georgia.  PD));33.4266687499999;-94.1386206730766
