They went to northwest over head at a rate I have never seen any human plane or such fly and a exmilitary child and wife here. They were dark grayish in color with a luminescence glow on the bottom a circle about the middle of the body and if you took a stealth fighter and stretched it long it would be close in shape... that is the only thing to compare it to.

It's huge and it's silent!!! I beleive it to be a secret aircraft or a real UFO. I'm familiar with milary a commercial aircraft shapes and behavier what i saw Thursday June 26th 2008 is the oddest shape craft i've ever seen. It looked like a B-1 bomber and an F-16 rammed together. The sun was setting but there was plenty of light so could clearly see the shape and get an idea of it's size. The front of the craft had a standard 'high speed' fighter jet shape swept wing (30'wide) without a tail section a very long fuesalage and a large main swept-wing. I would estimate the overall length to be 90'-100'(feet), and the wing-span of the main wing to be 80'-90'(feet). The color was dark non-refective gray almost ceramic looking. This craft was moving very slowly towards the South East at around 8:30pm. I watched it for about 3 minutes then it faded out. App. 60 minutes later it came back from the South East on a North Western heading moving much faster but still silent. By this time the sky was dark and could clearly see lights on it. This craft was totally 'silent' and it had a delta (triangle shape) pattern of cream colored lights on the front half of the craft, with duller, dimmer cream colored lights on the tips of the main wing. I had seen this craft once before after dark from the side and i could tell that the front delta pattern of lights were slightly lower and a little brighter than the others. All of the lights on this craft are constant, they don't 'blink' and there are no traditional aircraft green or red running lights. This craft is odd, it's huge and it's silent!!!. I beleive a few other people in this area ( Texarkana, Hooks, Lake Wright Patman Texas,: Foreman, Fouke Arkansas, and Idabel Oklahoma.) have seen it but only after dark. I know some have reported as a UFO.  ??? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));33.4266687499999;-94.1386206730766
