flashing,then solid with bright flaring.;2002-11-08 16:30:00;approx.2 min.;flashing,then solid with bright flaring. I stepped out on my deck to observe the clear night sky,(the first in about two weeks), when looking at cassiopeia, i observed a bight white flash,then after a brief time (2 or three seconds) it appeared again, another longer pause ,and it flashed again.It seemed gone,but, after about 15,20 seconds, it flashed again, then nothing.about 5 minutes later it appeared(in approximately same place)as a solid bright white light, slowly moving to the north. I excitedly ran to get my binoculars and was able to observe it for a few seconds until the light just seem to go out! i stayed out ready to see anything, i  looked at the moon through my binoculars, then turned back to look at cassiopeia when there it was again!it was very bright & flared to about three times it's original size,then back smaller and moved again to the north until i couldn't see it.;33.4266687499999;-94.1386206730766
Light close to the moon, moved then went out.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Jupiter near the Moon.  PD));2006-06-08 01:00:00;10 minutes;Light close to the moon, moved then went out. While I and some friends were outside last night, we saw a bright light close to the moon. The light was brighter than any star, it was above the moon. Then it went closer to the moon kinda to its left and went out. Just like that. NO it wasnt a falling star because it lasted about 10 mins. Or an airplane because it wasnt moving like one.

Dim blue/grey orb, at low altitude.;2012-11-08 21:40:00;2 minutes;Dim blue/grey orb, at low altitude. At approximately 9:40 p.m. 11/8/2012 I was home alone watching t.v., my dogs began to bark, and I felt the house rumbling.  As if someone was listening to a loud stereo in front of the house. Instead of a rhythmic thumping, it was more of a constant stub-audible rumble. I walked out front to see what the dogs were barking at and saw nothing in the street, but when I stepped out from under the eaves, I felt heat on my back.  I looked up and at tree top level above the house was a blue/gray glowing sphere.  As soon as I looked up, it took off due east, like it had been shot from a gun.  It got brighter as it picked up speed and about two miles it bounced north west, like a tennis ball hitting a brick wall.  After the bounce it was only visible for a flash and then disappeared. Two noteworthy observations.  First, the sky was overcast with low clouds, and it was well under the cloud cover. Secondly, as it took off from over the house, I could feel a sub-harmonic vibration, in the driveway.  But it never made an audible sound. There wasn't much to it, but it was a hair raising couple of minutes.;33.4266687499999;-94.1386206730766
