Boxy object flying in sky.;2019-02-15 18:00:00;2 minutes;Boxy object flying in sky. On Feb 15, 2019 at 6:00pm, I was crossing the FM 3090 overpass on HWY6 in Navasota, Tx. Nearing the end of the overpass, getting ready to make a left to go southbound on the HWY 6 feeder, I notice a Cessna 172 style plane traveling parallel to the highway, moving roughly NW.  Looking behind the plane I see an object following in the same direction, maybe 8 plane lengths away. At first, I thought the plane was towing something, but realize the plane if going slightly faster than the object and leaving it behind. I make my left onto the southbound HWY6 feeder, pull over and open my sunroof to take some pictures. The object continued to move roughly NW in direction, making no sound. It appeared to be about the same size as the plane and was traveling about 1500 feet high?  Dark gray/black in appearance, composed of multiple boxy segments. I took 5 pictures, and by that time it had traveled far enough that I couldnâ€™t get a angle through my sunroof to take anymore pictures.;30.3587;-96.0631
