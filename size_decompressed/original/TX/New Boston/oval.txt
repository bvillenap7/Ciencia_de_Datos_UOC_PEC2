We were coming home from church on a Wednesday night.  It was me, my mom, my sister and a friend of hers.  I saw a starlike object in the sky from a few miles away, and told my mom that I didn't remember seeing that there.  I love to watch the sky.  Anyway, we got closer, and it was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my whole life.  We saw a UFO.  I screamed for my mom to pull over, because it was getting lower and lower and I wanted to see it.  She pulled into a driveway, and we were in awe gazing out the window.  Being in such amazement, I stumbled out of the car, my family screaming in fright.  I was directly under this thing.  It was a huge oval shaped craft about 20 feet above my head.  Lights went around it, different colors.  They blinked.  I heard nothing.  It just sat there, over my head as if to let me look at it.  I saw a small square in the bottom, like a door.  The dimensions were hard to tell, I was only 16 at the time.  I do remember though, there was definetly not enough room for an adult to stand up in there.  I was so dumbfounded, as I had always read about UFO's but never really believed.  There I was, a young small town girl, seeing what was the most amazing thing in my life.  It hovered there, what seemed like hours, but was 2 or 3 minutes.  Then, before I could blink, it sped off like lightning.  NO SOUND!! Nothing, no whirr, no hum, nothing.  I was in shock.  Thank you for listening. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.4661;-94.4466
