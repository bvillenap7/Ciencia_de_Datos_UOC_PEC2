They moved from the south to the north at a very slow speed.  I kept listening to for the sound jet  but there was absoulutely no sound.  As the objects came over head we could see the stars between the objects. There were several student employees in engineering school at Red River Army depot who witnessed this. They swore they would never repeat the sighting for fear of losing their jobs.  I you were to draw a line right down Hwy 8 south to north that was approximately the flight direction.  Just a few hundred feet from RRAD property. These objects wereflying at approximately 18,000 to 25,000 feet. ((name deleted));33.4661;-94.4466
Bright star like objects disappear.;2015-12-16 18:35:00;45 seconds;Bright star like objects disappear Standing at my back door looking east, saw bright object which appeared to be a star, just to the right of it another what appeared to be a star not as bright and to the right of that another not very bright.  The object to the far right started moving downward and as I was watching the other 2 objects the large and smaller one they just disappeared.  Two commercial jets flew over to the left of the area where the objects disappeared a few minutes later and it was easy to tell they were commercial planes with their flashing red lights, they were no where as high as the objects that disappeared.;33.4661;-94.4466
