Chilton Texas 2 Bright Lights 11-24-19;2019-11-24 18:30:00;20 minutes;Chilton Texas 2 Bright Lights 11-24-19 I went out to let the dog out and saw 2 big bright lights in the sky that had never been there before.  They just stayed still up in the air.  I live in Marlin Texas and it looked to me like they were over Chilton Texas a city about 12 miles away from me.  I took some pic of them and watched them for about 10 min they never moved.  I went back in the house for about 15 min and came back out and they were gone.;31.31;-97.09
