Multiple vertical UFO's spotted over Edna, and Hope Texas area.  May 18 and 19 2012.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD));2012-05-19 21:00:00;1 hour;Multiple vertical UFO's spotted over Edna, and Hope Texas area.  May 18 and 19 2012 I was in my pasture and noticed, right before dark, a very bright light in the sky to the NW of me.  It  was vertical with a bright light on each end, and the brightest being at the top.  It seemed to be moiving towards me very slow.   I then noticed the star and realized they were not stars but more UFO's that looked the same but further away.   I called a friend who lives NE of me and he went out and could see it too. He could not see that it was long and vertical but described two bright lights next to each other.  It was bright enough that he noticed it right away.  He also couldnt see the othrs.   We watched them and talked.  The bright one then had rays of light come off of it like a starburst.  I became afraid and went inside.  On my way in I saw what I thought was a shooting star right above me, it was close enough that I almost screamed.  The difference was that this light was dim and disappeared instead of fading out.  I wanted to watch until the o! ther ones left so I could see how they left.  The person I was talking to had went inside also, he called me back about an hour later said it was gone.  I also saw it last night but just thought it was a bright star and just glanced at it before going in.  I also took a pic with my phone but it's not very good.;28.9502;-96.6435
