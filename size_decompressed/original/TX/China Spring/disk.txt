No engines were  heard, smooth movement unlike an airplane. There were two concentric circles that glowed, but weâ€™re not bright. No green or red lights were observed, but there seemed to be a bright strobe that faded. I have a photo and about 1:27 minutes of video. Needs enhancement. I am ex military and have never seen a craft like it.;31.6679;-97.2987
