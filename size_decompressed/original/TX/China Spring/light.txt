I SAW 3 BRIGHT FLARES OR LIGHTS COME FROM ONE OF THE OBJECTS. AFTER 4 MIN THERE ONLY 2 LEFT, THEY MADE ROUNDS IN THE SKY AND THEN FANISHED.;31.6679;-97.2987
Single white light in sky, high and fast, no blinking lights or tail.;2006-09-26 06:10:00;2 minutes;Single white light in sky, high and fast, no blinking lights or tail. Single white light in sky, equal in size and brightness to a star travelling very high and fast. Would guess this was at least in the upper atmosphere, if not in orbit.  No meteor tail, or blinking lights.  Constant speed in a straight line across sky, roughly going Southeast. Sun not up, but when in the brightest blue of sunrise (about an hour before), it disappeared for a few seconds.  Appeared again when out of line from where the sun rises, maintained course and speed. Disappeared again when moving into brighter blue on horizon.  It was much like what I've heard satelites passing by desribed as, but we've never seen this happen, esp not around here (near Waco, which is pretty well lit up 24/7).  We would have dismissed it as a satelite if we had seen one before, but this was a first, so we felt it prudent to report.  We throw the newspaper, and observe aircraft and meteors constantly, but this was unlike anything we've ever seen.  Thank you, and sorry for having trouble describing occurence.;31.6679;-97.2987
