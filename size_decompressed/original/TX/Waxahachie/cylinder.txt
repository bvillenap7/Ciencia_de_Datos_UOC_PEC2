Cylindrical objects hover soundlessly over Dallas suburb May 22, 2005.;2005-05-22 20:12:00;more than 2 minutes;Cylindrical objects hover soundlessly over Dallas suburb May 22, 2005. Cylindrical-shaped, wingless object caught my attention during sunset.  It was approximately 100 degrees above the horizon south south-west of Waxahachie, a suburb of Dallas, TX.   Object appeared when it caught the light of the sun, then disappeared, reappeared, several times.  It appeared to be very high, and hovered above the area soundlessly.  It remained motionless for several minutes.  A companion, in the south at about the same altitude, appeared to be identical in shape and was also motionless until it disappeared.  As the daughter of a pilot and aeronautical engineer, I am familiar with many types of aircraft -- none of which are shaped like these two objects or hover soundlessly for minutes.;32.3815584755408;-96.8356370875997
