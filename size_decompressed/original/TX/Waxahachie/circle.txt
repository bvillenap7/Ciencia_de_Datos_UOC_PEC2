Sunday night, 6/15/03, Waxahachie. Moving south to north;2003-06-15 22:25:00;3-4 seconds;Sunday night, 6/15/03, Waxahachie. Moving south to north I went outside after the evening news and was enjoying the cool breeze, while looking up at the Big Dipper I noticed what I thought was a plane, since Love Field and DFW Airport are north of Waxahachie. It only took a second to realize this thing was MOVING FAST. To get a better look I shielded my eyes and looked ahead of it a bit. I don't wear glasses so there was no reflection. The object was moving from south to north and I noticed a faint blue crescent or what may have been lights around the leading edge and sides with a faint yellowish circle in what would appear to be the middle. From the few seconds that I saw this I can only estimate that it was traveling at approximately 1200 to 1500 miles per hour. Estimated altitude is rough to even estimate but I would guess it was around 10,000 to 15,000 feet. It crossed roughly 30% of the sky in about 3 to 4 seconds. What I waited for after it went out of sight was the noise of it's engines. There was none. It was absolutely silent, and there wasn't any other aircraft in the area at the time that it went overhead. I know it sounds a little nuts, it sure does to me, but I grew up around the airline industry. My father was a dispatcher for Braniff for decades and I practically cut my teeth with him when he took with him when he went out to different stations. The thing is is that I can't get it out of my head. I can't identify it. I called the Dallas Fort Worth Airport Information line and they referred me to you. The control tower at DFW Airport, or Love Field also had to have seen this on radar. That's why I called them.  Please contact me;32.3815584755408;-96.8356370875997
ROTATING BLUE BEAM;2011-03-19 03:40:00;3 MIN;ROTATING BLUE BEAM MY FRIEND WORKING A SECOND JOB FOR CH 23 IN DALLAS TX WAS FILMING TRAFFIC ETC, WAS USING A 7000 DOLLAR CAMERA WHEN THEY NOTICED A BLUE BEAM AND WHITER ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BEAM POINTING TO THE GROUND.

THEY GOT IT ALL ON TAPE ALONG WITH SOME OTHER WITNESS WITH CELL PHONE VIDEO FROM OTHER WITNESS THEY COULD SEE ON THE TAPE.  A TRUCK DRIVER WAS PASSING BY AND FLASHED A PHOTO AND THE THING DISAPAREAD INTO THE HEVAN EXTREMELY FAST. THEY DID NOT REPORT THE INCIDENT.  BY THE TIME THEY RETURNED TO THE STATION IN DALLAS, FEMA REPRESENTAIVES WHERE THERE WITH HIGH MILITATY BRASS WHO CONFISCATED THE CAMERA AND CELL PHONES, AND ASK THEM QUESTIONS.  TOLD THEM NOT SAY ANYTHING.  THE OTHER WITNESS ON THE TAPE WERE CONTACTED IMMEDIATELY BY MILITARY OR CIA UNKNOWN PEOPLE AND SHOWED UP AT THERE HOME AND THEIR CELL PHONE WERE CONFISCATED IMMEDIATLY.  VERY STRANGE HOW THE MILITARY AND FEMA NEW THIS AND WAS ALREADY AT THE STATION AND KNEW THE ADDRESS OF OTHER WITNESS HOMES.
