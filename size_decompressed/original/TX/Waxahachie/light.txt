Very bright, then dimmed to orange colored. Watched this object for over three hours this evening.  It was slowly moving towards the west.  Bright light that would dim and then somehow turn back on.  It would stay lighted up for a half hour or so then turn off.  I closely watched to see if clouds where doing this and I noticed other stars nearby where not affected.  Brightest light in the sky at one point then dimmed to orange colored and then turn off again.  Not sure if its the space station, satellite, or what but it was kind of bizzare.  Was seen in the northwest sky going north northwest.;32.3815584755408;-96.8356370875997
