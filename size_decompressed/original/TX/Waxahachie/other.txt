My boyfriends dad and I were driving down highway 77 in Waxahachie Tx.  I looked up in the sky because I saw this random dark object, I told my boyfriend's dad to look and we were trying to figure out what it was.  The object would follow us and when we stopped, the object stopped.  It was black and it kept changing shapes, we changed direction, and so did the object.  We tried to get close to it and as we did it started fading and just disappeared.  It was in the sky west of waxahachie.;32.3815584755408;-96.8356370875997
