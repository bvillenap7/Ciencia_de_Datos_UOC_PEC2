Large triangular craft moved from north to south over north central Texas at midnight on Feb 24, 2006.;2006-02-24 00:00:00;under 1 minute;Large triangular craft moved from north to south over north central Texas at midnight on Feb 24, 2006. In my yard about midnight I looked up to see a series of lights outlining two sides of an equilateral triangle.  The lights were moving slowly across my rooftop from north to south, coming in from Dallas, TX (Waxahachie is about 35 miles south of Dallas).  The two leading edges of the triangle were each lit with 12-14 white lights.  I could see no lights along the back (trailing) side of the craft.  Movement appeared initially to be very slow.  So slow, in fact, that I first guessed these lights to be those of WWII planes from the Confederate air force flying in a tight formation.  I quickly discarded that hypothesis due to both the number of lights (estimate 25-28 total) and the precise distance of one from another.  Just as the craft cleared my roofline it appeared to speed up radically.  Within 1/2 second it had vanished far to the south.  It made no noise whatever.  I cannot estimate how high the craft or how fast it eventually was going.;32.3815584755408;-96.8356370875997
Green Light Over Waxahachie, very quick.;2010-04-12 01:00:00;3-4 Mins;Green Light Over Waxahachie, very quick. My family and I had been out for Dinner and went to the Cinemas that night and went to the park because my little sister wanted to play.  After about 30 mins that we had been there while she was playing and my parents and I sat and talked we noticed a lime green like triangle in the sky.  It was moving very quickly and heading east.  It stayed in eyesight for about 3 or 4 mins and then dissapeared.;32.3815584755408;-96.8356370875997
