Disk Shaped Object photographed near Waxahachie Texas;2010-10-01 12:16:00;1 second;Disk Shaped Object photographed near Waxahachie Texas I was taking photos of a real estate listing on FM 66 in Waxahachie Texas in Ellis County south of Dallas/Fort Worth.  I snapped this photo of a disk in the upper left hand corner.  I did not realize the image was there until today while reviewing the photos for the listing.  Today is October 2nd 2010, so I found the image one day after it was taken.  I have the image on the memoey stick, and saved on various computers.  The camera is a Nikon Coolpix P80.  The photo was taken at 12:16PM.  I took photos in the same area as this photo seconds before, the same minute per the time stamps, and the image is not in any of the other photos.;32.3815584755408;-96.8356370875997
