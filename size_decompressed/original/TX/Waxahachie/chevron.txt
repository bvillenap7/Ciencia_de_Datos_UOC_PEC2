Its wingspan fully covered the two-car driveway I was walking on, and then some.  I was walking directly north towards my house after checking on my kids who were attending a birthday party at another home in my complex. I noticed something just above my line of vision.  At first I thought it was a cloud forming, as it had the consistency of a fine, mist type cloud.  As it continued to move forward, I realized that the object had a solid outline with a consistent shape.  At that point, I thought perhaps it was a hang glider, but considering that this was in Texas, where there are no large hills, that made no sense at all.  Then, I thought it might have been a flock of birds, but the object had a solid form and a consistency of shape as it flew by.  It continued to fly or glide at a consistent rate and a direct line path, until I could no longer see it. The object was completely silent.  There were no lights.  The object almost blended into the starry background of the sky.  It had a somewhat mottled color of white and possibly dark, navy blue, grey or black.   The event lasted approximately 30 seconds before the image either evaporated, disappeared, or merely faded into the skyline, where the lights of the city were glowing over the homes across the street.  It was a beautiful clear night with no clouds.  I was taking photographs of the moon earlier in the evening. The object was flying very low and appeared to be only about 30 feet above the roof line of the homes it was flying over.  The object was not moving very fast.  If I had started running very quickly I might have been able to keep up with it.  I did not witness any entities, missing time, and I had not consumed any alcohol or drugs, I was completely alone.  The only physical experience I had was feeling sick to my stomach, approximately 30 minutes later, that lasted about 20 minutes. At first my logical brain was trying to determine what I was looking at.  I was in shock and awe.  By the time my brain registered that this was possibly an UFO I had a split-second thought to grab my cell phone and record it, but by then it was gone.  I was not in fear of the object at the time, because I was trying to determine what it was and the possibility of it being a UFO was the farthest thing from my mind, until it vanished.;32.3815584755408;-96.8356370875997
