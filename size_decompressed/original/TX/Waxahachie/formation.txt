V-formation of 20 of low-flying elongated arrowhead shaped objects;2020-02-16 20:15:00;20 seconds;V-formation of 20 of low-flying elongated arrowhead shaped objects February 16, 2020 at about 8:15 pm, my girlfriend and I saw a formation of about 20 to 25 objects fly directly over our house. The formation was a flattened V-shape, flying about 100 to 200 feet high.   The objects were identical.  Each object looked like an elongated arrow head with a line straight down the middle, and they had a V-shaped indentation on the rear.  The formation was travelling about 100 mph.  No sound. No lights, but they had a white/greenish glow.   At first we both thought they were birds, but after getting a good look, we could see they were not birds.  After it flew over the house, I ran around to the other side of the house to see where it went, but it disappeared.  No pictures or videos because  we were stunned by the sight of this.  By the time we gathered our thoughts, it was gone.;32.3815584755408;-96.8356370875997
