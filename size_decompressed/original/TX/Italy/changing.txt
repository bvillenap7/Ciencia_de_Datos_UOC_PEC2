Reflective UFOs change shape and make random patterns in the sky before disappearing and then reappearing.;2011-03-26 10:30:00;30 seconds;Reflective UFOs change shape and make random patterns in the sky before disappearing and then reappearing. I was driving north on IH 35 headed to Dallas.  It was somewhere around 10:30 am.  The sky was clear blue, not a cloud in sight.  The ufos were directly above the interstate northbound lanes.   When I first noticed them they were spread out evening to form an arch shape.  When I saw them in this formation they looked to be an oblong shape and either metallic/reflective.  They then quickly transitioned into a different formation... more of a comet tail, but now they looked more triangular.   Then then moved to a random pattern and sort of individual disappeared but before they disappeared it almost looked like they were flashing lights except it seemed to be more of a reflective light (like a mirror in the sun)... all within a second or two.  Then I looked over towards the south bound lanes of the interstate and they appeared in the random formation past that side of the highway and then disappeared again.  They literally disappeared in one spot and reappeared in another. At first when I saw the oblong shapes I thought it might have been wings from a small plane but then when they changed shaped and moved at such rapids speeds I threw that theory out the window. From what I could tell it couldn't have been planes at the speed the had to have traveled to get from point a to point b.  I for sure counted 6 ufos but feel like there might have been a 7th one visible at one point, but I'm unsure. Later that evening I tried googling UFOs sightings in Texas and nothing came up.  I have continued to randomly search the internet to see if someone else might have reported something but it still looks as if I'm the only one.;32.1775;-96.8858
