((HOAX))whatthef_ _ _;2005-06-23 04:04:00;30 seconds;whatthef_ _ _ well i was sitting in a chair in my backyard star gazing with my telescope and i wasw just scanning the skies when i looked straight up i saw a bright light moving across the sky very fast i mean a lot slower than a shooting star, but much faster than a airplane. it traveled all the way across the sky from directly overhead till it stopped just short of the horizen as it was moving it changed speeds several times and at one point seemed to divide leaving a light stationary while it continued onward.it did this several times leaving what looked like a normal star there.does anybody know what this might have been?
