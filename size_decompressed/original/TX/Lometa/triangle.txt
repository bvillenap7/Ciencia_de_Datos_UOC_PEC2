3 bright lights hovering soundless in Lometa, Texas, seen by father and daughter.;2013-11-28 00:00:00;18:00;3 bright lights hovering soundless in Lometa, Texas, seen by father and daughter. My 13 year old daughter and I were walking to camp from the deer stand.  It was a very clear quiet night.  To the south we saw 3 very bright lights appear to be hovering high in the sky.   We did not hear a sound of any kind.  No engine or jet sounds.   The 3 lights were side by side.  The lights appeared to hover for 3 or 4 minutes the veer away from us.   At that time the lights appeared to change to a more triangle shape.  What we saw was not a plane.  It did not have the natural characteristics of an airplane or helicopter.  And as stated it did not create any sound.   This is my 3rd similar sighting in Lometa County and my first time to report it.;31.2198;-98.4026
