3 Large Lights on a horizontal saucer shaped object;2008-11-13 20:00:00;10 Seconds;3 Large Lights on a horizontal saucer shaped object My girlfriend and I were at our ranch on Thursday driving to our neighborâ€™s cabin in our utility vehicle. She started freaking out and said what is that over there. I looked over and saw three huge and bright lights that lit up one after the other and were all horizontal and next to each other. They were not your normal lights and the object was definitely in the shape of a saucer. The lights were very bright and very large however they were not blinding to the eye.  The moon was full and it was very bright so you could see the object very clear. The lights disappeared and then reappeared about .25 mile to the right. I would estimate that this object was a half a mile in the air and about 1-2 miles away from us. After it lit up two times it jus disappeared. There was no streak or anything as it went away. It simply vanished. There was also no noise. This happened in a very rural area and was definitely not anything military. I think the object was about 100 yards or larger across. This was definitely a UFO and nothing else. I am positive. My girlfriend is a non believer in UFOs and is now a believer. She was so nervous and scared that she started puking on the side of the road. I am still blown away with what we saw and hope someone else spotted this the same night and will place a report. We are not alone.;31.2198;-98.4026
