A real big green flash in the western sky;1999-11-16 05:00:00;2 seconds;A real big green flash in the western sky All this happened so fast, we didn't see nothing in the sky just a huge green flash in the western sky.  There was no sound.  We could never find out from the tv news or the newspaper what it was, nothing.   I would appreciate if you all could get back with me if you have any info on this happening.   We were watching for leonids that night that happened.  I know a lot of things were going on that night.  Were big fans of Art Bell and listed when we can. You people are doing a great job up there keep it up.   Thanks a lot.  I really appreciate.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
A spotting of bright and unusual flashes from the sky.;2001-06-14 01:28:00;1 minute;A spotting of bright and unusual flashes from the sky. I didn't really know who to report this to, but a close friend and I witnessed an event that we both believe to be very unusual.  At around 1:00AM on the 10th or 11th of June 2001, while we were in his back yard we both witnessed a blinding reflection of bright white light.  Neither of us heard anything, nor did we see anything after that. And just now at 1:28AM on the 14th of June 2001, I witnessed a bright white reflection of light off of everything in my back yard as if a helicopter flew directly over my house with it's spotlight shining, but I heard no noise.  I immediately went outside to see what it might have been and stood out there for about a minute before I saw two consecutive flashes of an orangish light that reflected off of all of the clouds in the sky facing north of my home which was the direction I was facing at the time of the incident.  Again, no noise or any discernible origination of the light was to be recognized.  I don't know what to make of it, but I will be watching for any more unnusual activity.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Was in a very highly lit place riding in the passenger side of a car.  I looked up and saw a light, almost slightly green, that looked like it was falling out of the sky, and then disappeared.  Again, I was in an incredibly well-lit area, near the Lovers-Greenville intersection, and it was very bright.  The driver saw the object out of the corner of his eye.  I would say it was a shooting star, but it was different, much brighter, and just didn't look like any I had seen, and had no trail or anything.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Yellowish Orb appears and vanishes within seconds at high speed;2011-01-24 20:00:00;5s;Yellowish Orb appears and vanishes within seconds at high speed I was looking at the Orion constellation in the SE sky when out of the corner of my left eye, I saw a bright yellowish flash in the NE sky, turned out to be a orb at approximately 1000 feet in the air, streaking from the NW part of sky towards the SE.  It moved at a very fast speed I would considering the distance it covered in the short time it was illuminated, it covered at least 60-90 degrees of the sky in a matter of 5s and like going behind an invisible wall it vanished. Now I will consider that its relative traveling direction was E-SEish from my apartment complex where in relation to an airport just south of me does have heavy air traffic, however having seen hundreds of planes in the night sky travel over my head this was not the normal.  On the contrary no plane at night turns their lights off especially on approach to land.  Besides every plane makes a noise and this was silent making no noise. Having witnessed multiple shooting stars I can also say that this was definitely not that either.  It was simply too bright, in my example its as if the lights just went out, like turning a light bulb off w/o the afterglow effect, or nothing like the dwindling light of a shooting star.

Bright enough to light the edge of the neighborhood to where it seemed to be 3:30 in the afternoon.   The flash seemed to be about 100 ft in the air and about 8 feet across- but the bright light it emitted exposed a good 50-100 yards in front of me in all directions, seemingly.   There was no sound prior to the event.   After the event, it sounded like power lines were being interfered with.   Weather was clear.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
