Orange and pink glowing object following a South West Airlines jet in Dallas, Tx.;2002-08-01 20:45:00;45 seconds;Orange and pink glowing object following a South West Airlines jet in Dallas, Tx. On August 01st, 2008, at approximately 8:45 P.M. I saw a Southwest Jet passing over the area where I work. I could read the name on the tail and I recognized the Southwest colors and Logo.  I was outside, I do security at night outdoors.  I looked up and heading from where I was standing, North-East toward Love Field Airport I saw a Southwest Airlines jet passing over head. It was about to land I think at Love field as far as I could tell according to the direction it was traveling.  I noticed a light pink and orange object with no sound other than the noise made by the jet and I noticed this slightly glowing craft teardrop in shape or acorn and about the size of a small bus or van  off the jet's right wing about two hundred yards over and about one and hundred fifty yards to the right moving slightly behind  traveling at the same speed the jet was traveling as though it was pacing the jet. I would guess they were about 7 to 8 Hundred feet up and both very visible from where I was standing. It was just starting to get dark.  I watched until both craft went out of my view. This lasted about 45 seconds.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Orange-red flash, lasting about 5 seconds.;2015-06-13 22:50:00;5 seconds;Orange-red flash, lasting about 5 seconds. I saw an orange red flash of light that looked teardrop in shape.  It only lasted 5 seconds.   It was just below the Big Dipper area and bigger than any of the stars in the sky.   Seemed like something that was just about where you would enter the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
