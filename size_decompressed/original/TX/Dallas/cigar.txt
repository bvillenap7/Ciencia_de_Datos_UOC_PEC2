Large cigar shaped metalic flying object;1989-06-01 20:00:00;3 minutes;Large cigar shaped metalic flying object I'm a retired xxx Airlines 777 Captain and former USAF Search & Rescue Pilot.  I thought you might be interested sightings I've had during my carrier?   In the early 1980's, I was flying as Captain on an MD80 from DFW to DEN.  Our departure time was approximately 8:00 pm, hazy, but with partial light still in the sky.  Climbing out of DFW on an initial 185 degree heading, and just passing through approximately 1,000' AGL (above the ground), I spotted a very large object out of the copilots window.  I immediately made the statement to my copilot, What the @#*! is that?  It appeared to be elongated and cigar shaped, a grey metallic looking object, moving very slowing from right to left (west to east), and it appeared to have many small, dark, and slightly fuzzy looking, rectangular windows running longitudinally along the length of the object a line or band of windows?  I immediately called departure control on the radio and asked, Departure, do you show anything ahead of us on radar.  He replied, No, why do you ask?  I told him I wasn't sure but that we thought that there was an object out ahead of us.  At first seeing the object, which was initially located in the right third of my copilots window from my viewpoint, I thought that it might be the undercarriage of a 747.  The object appeared to be moving very slowly.  However, as we accelerated on climb out, the object did not appear to be changing in size indicating that we were not going to have an immediate collision.  I had seen mirages many times before in the past, and so I initially thought that this might be a mirage.  Because of the hazy sky conditions, moisture in the air, and dusk, it didn’t appear to be a mirage, but still a possibility.  As we climbed out of 4500’, the object was now leaving us toward the east but still visible in the left third of my windscreen when departure had us turn to the northwest on our way toward Denver.  I didn’t think much of the incident until years later when I happened to turn the television on during one of my layovers.  The program, In Search Of was on and this particular segment was about a sighting over Montreal (Torronto?), Canada.  In that program, several hundred witnesses described exactly what my copilot and I had seen on our departure out of DFW during the same time period.  The announcer stated that through triangulation, the objects length was determined to be 6,000’ long.  That’s a mile long and would explain why it appeared that we were not closing on the object we saw!  I thought my sighting above might have some interest for your research?  Other pilot friends have had different encounters.  Back in 1979, I was flying with one 707 pilot and he told me that during a nighttime letdown approach into LAX, when still east of Palm Springs, California, he and his Captain had to take evasive action in order to avoid hitting another flying object.  As they pulled back on the stick to avoid colliding with their “UFO”, they could clearly see inside the “cockpit” of this craft and clearly saw the “pilots”.  Both of the American pilots were former USAF pilots and they both knew what oxygen masks looked like, the type worn by military pilots.  What they saw on the “UFO pilots” face(s), helmet or oxygen masks, they said was nothing they had ever seen before.  In their estimate, it was not of this planet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We have encouraged the source to try to determine the exact date, using his flight logs.  Also, we have requested that he have the other pilots submit reports, as well.  PD));32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Pie shaped craft ignited rocketlike engine ,skipped across the sky and vanished silently at tremendous speed.;2000-08-15 21:44:00;1-1.5 seconds;Pie shaped craft ignited rocketlike engine ,skipped across the sky and vanished silently at tremendous speed. Pie-shaped craft seemed to suddenly appear traveling at what looked like average airplane velocity. Love Filed airport is not far away so the majority of the planes in the sky are assending or descending, so scalability of airplane size is not hard to fathom. We were facing southeast looking southeast on the patio at a local restaur 21:44 CST.  glancing at the sky above the the adjacent table, I noticed the craft heading west. The sun had not set all the way so the craft could be seen fairly well. Its texture didn't appear any differant than the materials made for modern aircraft,and not unlike typical flying saucer materials.The size of the craft was misleading because it seemed to big to be that low in the sky. My mind could not make out it relationship to it distance in respect to its size.. It seemed to me for an instant first a small plane seen upclose, , then seemed to appear like a helicopter, probably my mind making up for the differance in size to as were it should have been. As the idea of it being a meteor started to cross my mind, my reflexes, already fired, was already thrusting my pointing finger to the sky as the craft employed some sort of energy device and increased it speed incredibly. what appeared to be the back of the craft, lit up with a white light. The light was not the light typical of lights on planes but was more akin to a white flash, white hot like a welders torch. The white flash was produced in an area rectangular in shape, with even distribution of the white light. The craft skipped forward at high speed and disappeared,Hyperspace style. As its engines ignited I shouted UFO and my associate witnessed the speed increase, skipping, and disappearance. We agreed that the white light was not similar to the break-up of a meteor or its falling deris.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
cigar shape wingless aircraft seen over midday.;2008-02-08 13:30:00;3 seconds;cigar shape wingless aircraft seen over midday. It was a bright sunny afternoon with clear blue sky.  I saw a low angle large reflected metallic glint in the sky and looked at the glint.  Turned out to be a wingless cigar shaped aluminum colored craft moving northerly at about 5000 feet or less in altitude.  The sight is very close to a landing path to a local airport and this craft is too high for aircraft in this particular area.  As I started to focus on the glint, I realized the craft just went up in the air about 5000 more feet and then third second, it was gone.  The craft when it went up in altitude did not move forward to go up, it just went backward from me, meaning it just went up in the sky in unbelievable speed with no sound and within 2 seconds, it was gone.  It never moved forward another foot from where it was when it was when I first saw it.    there was no wings or tail or any marking except it was grey metallic color in a cigar long shape.

Bright white cigar shaped object hovering in Western sky for 35 minutes;2008-03-20 16:10:00;35 minutes;Bright white cigar shaped object hovering in Western sky for 35 minutes At approximately 4:10 this afternoon, 3-20-08, as I was going to my car, I looked up and saw a bright, white cigar shaped object in the sky to the west. It appeared to be hovering but was moving slightly vertically, and horizontally. I watched it for 5 minutes, and then called my neighbor to witness what I saw.  She saw it as well, and said I should report it. I called 911 and they connected me to the UFO Center.  I reported the incident to Mr Peter Davenport, who asked that I write this narrative. I also reported it to WFAA TV...the ABC Affiliate in Dallas.  They said no other sightings had been reported to them.  While still viewing the object after 10 minutes, other American aircraft were flying around, over, and beneath the object. The American aircraft appeared to be military jets because there were smoke trails coming from the back of the crafts.  There were also domestic aircraft flying which looked MUCH smaller than the UFO, and I assume they were flying their regular routes.  I went inside to get my binoculars...and through them I could see the object much better. There appeared to be an orange color on the bottom of the craft. I called my mother, who lives 6 miles away from me, and she saw the disc as well.  I have enclosed pictures of the craft.  I cropped 1 of the pictures...and I left the other 2 photos untouched, so the tree line would be visible.  The object had been visible for 35 minutes when I got into my car and left.   I came back home around 7:00 PM, but the object was no longer visible.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Bright white light cigar shaped object seen flying slowly to the north in slight decent.;2010-10-12 19:10:00;5 minutes;Bright white light cigar shaped object seen flying slowly to the north in slight decent. POSSIBLE UFO SIGHTING On October 12, 2010 about 7:10 PM I was walking to my car when I looked up at the sky and saw a slender, elongated white light object traveling slowly in the sky toward the north.  It did not change course or make any other movement other than traveling forward at a slight decent.   There is no airport nearby in that direction.  I watched it for about five minutes until it passed out of my sight range.  The object had no structure, only bright white light.  Therefore, it was definitely not a plane.  Nothing was emitted from it, and I could hear no sound.   The object was high in the sky, so did not get an up-close view of it. The weather was clear, about 75 degrees, and no moisture.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Lone massive object in the sky.;2020-08-04 20:19:00;~20 minutes;Lone massive object in the sky At first I thought it was a plane leaving a trail, but this was going from up to down in direction. At first it left a bit of a trial but then it was just a massive long shape. It looked white from the distance I was at. Sky was completely clear, this was the ONLY object in the sky. WAY bigger than a plane. Could not have been aircraft, I live by both DFW and Dallas Love Field, I see many planes daily.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
