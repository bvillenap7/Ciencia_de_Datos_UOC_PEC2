Just travelled East to West, leisurely.;2004-07-04 19:00:00;FEW MINUTES;Just travelled East to West, leisurely. This was told to me by my Mom, who saw it. She was watching an airplane heading NNW to a local airport when she saw an object shaped and sized like a rail freight car. It was pure white in color with no wings, tail or lights and was travelling West. It should/ could have been observed by the airliner she was watching. She lives in the S.E. area of Dallas,TX.

hovering rectngular shaped object;2005-03-31 23:15:00;2-3 minutes;hovering rectngular shaped object It was a clear night. I noticed 2 large white lights as those of an approaching aircraft as if coming in for a landing. There is an airport about one mile from sighting area (Addison). We were driving toward the object yet it appeared to be hovering.  As I realized it was not converging as fast as it should I became more curious. The craft was hovering at approximately 300 feet. I would estimate the length to be about 250 feet by about 50 feet and 50 feet tall. There were no strobes as an aircraft would have. There was a big white constant light at each bottom corner of the forward leading edge and one constant white light located on the lower center trailing edge.  The driver of the vehicle would not stop (on tollway) so we progressed under the object. I was unable to detect any real detail of the object other than dimensions. After passing the object it appeared to continus to remain motionless.The rear of the trailing edge where you would expect the tail of an airplane to be had a square box shaped area like 20x20 that had multiple small blinking lights (red,white,blue).  I continued to observe the objects orientation as we proceeded away from it and it remained fixed. After pleading to the driver to turn around several minutes passed before we could exit and re-enter the tollway to backtrack. The object was gone upon returning.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
A single, rectangle shaped object with red lights and alternating blinking white lights, like hazard lights flew over Dallas, Texas.;2014-11-14 19:31:00;45-60 seconds;A single, rectangle shaped object with red lights and alternating blinking white lights, like hazard lights flew over Dallas, Texas. On this night of November 14th, facing a little southeast, at approx. 7:31 pm, while driving with a sibling, we saw an unidentified flying object.  It was rectangle in shape and was black.  It had 5 lights on the front resembling that of high beams, but were blinking like hazard lights but in an alternating fashion.  There were 2 red lights on the outside and 3 white lights in the middle.  The white lights were the main lights blinking, almost like search lights.   The object flew in an upright position so that when it flew over me I could see its underside which was rectangle shaped as well.   The more extraordinary part about this sighting is that I could also hear the object.  It made a light whooshing sound that was softer than that of a plane and kept the same tone.  It was a calming sound like that of ocean waves and I live nowhere near a large body of water capable of producing such a sound.   It also was lower than any plane I've ever seen before.  The object came rig! ht out of the clouds in front of me as I was driving on a residential road near my home.   Seeing the object prompted me to pull over and get out of my car to witness this immaculate event.   The object literally flew right over me allowing to give such specific details.   After this experience was over I got back in my car and pulled off.  As I got on a nearby highway I was able to see the object once again as it faded off into the clouds once more and was at a higher position in the sky than before when it was right over me.   This was one of the most shocking events I've seen.  To actually experience what I've only heard people speculate about and document encounters about is beyond any word I could use to describe.   Truly freaky and bewildering.  I hardly know what to think.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
