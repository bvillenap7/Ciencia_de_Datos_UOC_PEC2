Red light had a diamond shaped craft around it. About 2 minutes later a high speed jet aircraft flew from south to nor that same altitude thru clouds as the red light but it was already gone.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Object traveling south suddenly makes an immediate change of direction 45 degrees to the left, speed increased threefold and disappears;2000-06-25 00:24:00;45 sec;Object traveling south suddenly makes an immediate change of direction 45 degrees to the left, speed increased threefold and disappears Saturday evening around 12:35, I noticed an object in motion just to the east of Polaris. It was moving directly due South, approximately 5 degrees per second. At first I thought satellite but immediately dismissed that as it was too late and the sun too far West to illuminate an orbiting object. I then thought meteor as it seemed to have an orange or amber glow. I discounted that as there was no trail and the level of illumination did not change. As it came closer to overhead, I noticed the object was made up of 5 separate lights in the shape of a baseball diamond. The lights did not strobe or blink, but they flickered. I felt this was probably atmospheric disturbance. I tracked the object as it sped due South. I finally reckoned it was some aircraft with a non-regulation lighting arrangement when suddenly, without changing speed, the object made a 45 degree IMMEDIATE change of direction to the left (southeast). (THIS WAS NOT A TURN) and at the same time, the object increased it's speed threefold and disappeared. I've never seen or imagined anything like it. This was absolutely NOT a natural phenomenon. It was also NOT anything am familiar with or aware of.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
i never seen something like that .;2003-08-20 20:30:00;17mins;i never seen something like that . i was driving home over a brige and in the distance i could see a strage light moving back a forth and the person who i was with before i could say anything said look at that what is that and i said i was just abuot to ask you the same thing and we noticed it was getting lower and lower and moving in a direction that we could follow on the ground it turned and we turned then we were going up to a dead end and could not get in back behind the houses that were in front of us so we pulled in to a driveway a back as far as we could and the craft was moving very very slow so slow i thought it was going to fall out of the sky but it didnt instead it slowly moved closer and closer it was so close that now i could see it it was multi shaped in one way but it seam to shake or qake or move in so many diffrent directions but stable and it glowed orange or a type of orange that looked like the bottom of a cigarit liter flame. I didnt hear but mabe a wind but deffently it was not making enough sound that was was anything. it sat there for a few mins and then slowly went over a cliff and i could not follow anymore.

As I was putting it together I looked up to see where the moon was so I could adjust my telescope accordingly. As I stared in the sky I witnessed a solid moving object that made no sound. I move from West to East at what appeared to be 5-10 mph. It had no visible lights which threw me because I always invisioned an UFO having quiet a few lights. I watched as it slowly went overhead for about a minute. It never changed speed or made a sound. Because it was dark, I could only make out that it was what appeared to be a diamond shape.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
DIAMOND SHAPED OBJECTS MANEUVERING IN DALLAS NIGHT SKIES.;2013-10-04 19:15:00;6 minutes;DIAMOND SHAPED OBJECTS MANEUVERING IN DALLAS NIGHT SKIES. DALLAS, TX 10/4/13 @ 7:15PM..... I WAS OUTSIDE WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS, SKY CONDITIONS WERE CLEAR BLUE SKIES WITH A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF CLOUDS.  NOW WHAT I NOTICED IS A FEW CHEMTRAIL CLOUDS THEN WHAT CAUGHT MY EYES WAS A BRIGHT ORB LIKE MOVEMENT.  WHAT I THOUGHT TO BE A PLANE WITH A BRIGHT SUN REFLECTION TURNED OUT TO NOT BE.  AS I WATCHED IT DISPERSE A FEW TRAILS A SMALL BIT AT A TIME IN THE STRAIGHT DOWN DIRECTION.  THEN STARTED MOVING IN A STRAIGHT AWAY DIRECTION RIGHT BEFORE IT FADED AWAY FROM SIGHT.  RIGHT OUT OF THE FIRST BIT OF DISPERSMENT CAME OUT ANOTHER BRIGHTLY LIT ORB HEADED STRAIGHT DOWN.  THIS ONE DID NOT DISPERSE ANYTHING. THEN ONCE AGAIN RIGHT BEFORE I LOST VIEW OF IT BEHIND A TREE A THIRD STARTED MOVING UPWARD THEN CROSSING RIGHT OVER THE SKY.  AT THE SAME TIME AS THIS HAPPENING ...THE KIDS POINTED OUT AN ACTUAL PLANE LIKE OBJECT COMING SIDEWAYS CLEARLY DISPERSING CHEMS ALL THE WAY ACROSS.  NOW TO CLARIFY WHAT I WAS SEEING WASNT A EYE TRICK...O! THER ACTUAL AIRPLANES WERE STARTING TO CROSS THE AREAS. WHICH THE KIDS WERE ABLE TO CLEARLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OBJECTS.  TO MAKE IT EVEN WEIRDER WE SAW ONE OBJECT THAT CLEARLY HAD NO WINGS BUT MANEUVERED JUST LIKE A PLANE COME ACROSS LAST.  NOW TO GET MORE EVIDENCE I TRIED RECORDING IT WITH MY CAMERA PHONE WHICH RECORDS IN HD 1080P BUT THE OBJECTS DID NOT APPEAR ON CAMERA BUT THE PLANES DID.  THIS ALL HAPPENED BETWEEN 7:15-7:21PM IN NORTH DALLAS.  I WOULD LOVE TO DISCUSS MORE IF U LIKE.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
