I lay very still while witnessing the light move closer and what appeared in the doorway was a very bright, iluminated sphere. I can only characterize movement as being suspended, yet bobbing about in an almost fluid motion. It came close, then raced upward and directly shot out of the window. My husband witnessed this thing, but refuses to ever dicuss it. Even denies it took place. Went to bed after a normal workday and fell asleep. An hour or so later I awoke  and noticed a light coming from another room. I instantly was aware that it could not be a light inadvertantly left on as it had a distictive illuminating glow about it. For reasons unknown to myself, i instinctively had the impression that it was coming. I lay completely still as this light became brighter as it moved closer to the bedroom door. In the doorway appeared an extremely bright illuminated spere. This thing had the color of something so bright that it was almost bluish. It remained bobbing in the doorway a short while, then moved directly over me, moved from over  my head to my feet staying up near the ceiling as it did so. It then moved directly over my abdomin and descended slowly until it was inches, I mean inches, from my stomach. It then bobbed there for thirty or forty seconds, then slowly rose to about two or three feet above me. I then realized my husband was sound asleep during all of this and tried to awaken him. I was being subtle as I was afraid that too much motion would disturb this bobbing orb above me. He finally awoke and I thought he was going to have a seizure. At the point of his gasping, this thing rose quickly raced out of the window. At this point we both jumped to the window to see where this thing went, but it was nowhere to be seen. My husband was completely shaken by this event and over time has decided it didn't happen. I, myself, have been timid about mentioning it to anyone because i do not wish to be percieved as some kind person needing psychiatric attention. I do so now because I have always been perplexed by this, but have never heard of anyone experiencing something like this. I hope that at least by reporting it now, someone with similar experiences can be assured that they are not delusional.                                                I do not know if this was a UFO or not, but people mentioning seeing illuminated spheres have prompted me to report this.I have seen th! em on and off for years at a distance,                                                                I only want to add that they do not seem mechanical at all, more like something alive, with presence.                                                                  Please feel free to toss this out if it does not fit with your forum here, as I am not sure what forum in which it does belong.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

As I looked up I witnessed a jet banking hard to follow a sphere to a higher altitude then to the east. This evening I was looking at the Orion Nebula when I heard a strange noise over my head. It sounded like a short burst of claps or compress- ions.  As I looked up I noticed several aircraft before I viewed the source of the noise.Tha aircraft I observed first were a passenger jet heading West towards Love Field and a helicopter heading N/NW. As I looked  straight up I saw a military jet making a severe bank up into the sky following a sphere that was about 60 foot in diameter.The jet followed the object East to an altitude of at least 4000 feet(yes it was that low) Then the sphere was gone,into thin air. I watched as the jet leveled out and climbed gradually heading south as it slowed it's speed.Within sixty seconds two helicopters were in the vicinity,both hovering about and scanning the area it seemed.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Object chased by Jets producing jagged contrails for over 30 minutes....;2003-01-16 07:00:00;1.5 hrs;Object chased by Jets producing jagged contrails for over 30 minutes.... At 0700 central time, I noticed a large lit object , almost directly overhead...Assumed it was venus (as commonly reported)..The sun was not up yet, and I called to my wife to see the VERY bright planet. When We looked again some ten minutes later, it had moved about a foot at arms length. (too far to move for a planet in the short timeframe)  Wife dismisssed it...Until fifteen minutes later, we both saw that it had disappeared!  Ten minutes past that, as I drove her to work, we saw contrails of two VERY fast moving jets converging on the EXACT spot where the light had been. They crossed this same patch of sky over and over again in an x pattern seemingly searching for the object(approx fifteen minutes).  When I returned home, I got binoculars to observe, and could only make out the contrails (puffy, and definately corkscrewed) converging again and again on this spot.(approx 30 minutes)..Then to my surprise, The light then reappeared (I could make out that it was round with shadow)!  Both jets made tight turns and converged on the spot again....and as they were a foot away at arms length the light blinked off! as the planes crossed each other, I saw the light reappear to the south about two feet away at arms length!..Again, the Jets executed tight turns and converged on the same spot, only to have the light dissappear again. this occured two more times, and then the light disappeared totally.... I witnessed the short, jagged contrail-producing jets criscross that patch of sky over and over again until 10:30.  I saw a multitude of commercially identifiable planes (S.West and American) fly under the area in question producing no trails...Did anyone else witness this? ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness over the telephone, and found him to be quite credible and serious-minded.  We do not know what the witnesses witnessed.

Luminous translucent red sphere;2003-10-12 22:20:00;5 minutes;Luminous translucent red sphere I was visiting a friend in Dallas. At the end of the night, I went outside and waited for my friends to say goodbye. I felt as though there were someone standing near me, I turned and noticed a glowing red sphere. At first I thought my eyes were playinig tricks on me. Then I felt a bit of surprise as I realized this was not an illusion instantaneously the object moved two feet back. I calmed myself and spoke to the object, complimenting it's colors. The sphere was approximately 12 inches in diameter and had what appeared to be divits spaced two inches apart on the surface. These divits were brighter and lighter than the overall object, which glowed a luminous red. Gazing at the sphere, I noticed it was translucent. I was distracted by my friend talking to me. As I turned back to see the object, it was gone. I looked around and noticed it had moved five houses down the street.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Brightly illuminated orb near I35 and 635 in Dallas at 3 am 11/29/08  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;2008-11-29 03:00:00;<15 seconds;Brightly illuminated orb near I-35 and 635 in Dallas at 3 am 11/29/08   Brightly illuminated orb appeared near eastbound Highway 635 between I35 and Dallas  North Tollway just after 3am.  Because it was very dark and rainy, I was travelling around 45 mph.  I noticed an extremely bright light that appeared to be emitting from a glass office building on the south side of the highway.  It was so bright that I had to squint, and I assumed it to be some sort of spotlight affixed to one of the lower floors of the building.  The light began to flash arhythmically then stayed illuminated and moved rapidly and diagnonally from the lower left side of the building to the upper right side of the building, then it flew toward the west (the opposite direction I was travelling), zooming very quickly directly over my vehicle, perhaps 8-10 stories above the ground.  Entire sighting lasted only a few seconds.   My radio was turned off because my daughter was asleep in the car, and I heard no sounds coming from the object and saw no propellers or wings.  It was not a large object, perhaps the size of a basketball. Immediately after, a street lamp in front of the building extinguished.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Colorful sphere flying below clouds moving north west turning off its lights as it flew over my house.;2017-03-18 20:35:00;15 seconds;Colorful sphere flying below clouds moving north west turning off its lights as it flew over my house. I had just put my toddler down for bed and stepped outside to sit by the pool and relax for a moment.  It was 8:30 pm..  That's when I saw what I thought was an airplane at first, but as it flew over, I realized it wasn't an airplane by the way the lights were changing.  There was also no sound.  It was cloudy and the object was flying low and under the clouds.   It was a sphere with red, blue and orange lights emitting from it.  It was flying too slow to be a meteor and low enough that I could see it was a sphere.   It was flying North West from the South East and as it passed over our house the lights turned off.  But with the clouds in the sky, I could still see a dark sphere against the white cloud backdrop.  And it kept moving until it disappeared.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Spherical white UFO flying north over Dallas - I have video evidence;2021-05-25 21:20:00;1:00;Spherical white UFO flying north over Dallas - I have video evidence I was standing outside while I let my dog outside around 9 pm on Tuesday may 25, 2021.  I use an app on my phone to identify stars and planets in the night sky, and I saw a cluster of three stars I wanted to identify, so I opened my app.  Two out of the three stars appeared on the app’s radar. Then I realized the “third star” was not a star at all.  It began to move, and quickly. The white orb moved directly north until it was too small to see anymore.  It was unlike anything I’ve ever seen, and it was not flashing red or any color like a plane or satellite.  I have seen 2 ufos before this in my entire life. The first was a blue circular glowing orb in Galveston Texas in June of 2020.  It appeared and disappeared on a night drive by the ship harbor. It was almost inexplainable.  The second ufo I saw was a white orb in broad daylight in March 2021 in Texas while driving to Houston.  It hovered above my car  and disappeared.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
