Strange shape shifting craft of pure light energy.;1980-10-10 22:00:00;5 Minutes;Strange shape shifting craft of pure light energy. It was my birthday and at about 10PM I was walking outside my house when I noticed a curious light formation in the sky. The shape was indescribable, it had a form that shifted with time, first a circle, now a trapezoid, etc... It appeared to be pure light energy. It was zooming around high in the sky at incredible speeds, it then seemed to fly up and out of Earth's atmosphere. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

At 03:15 on 09-02-99, I was awakened by a loud alarm on my Trifield magnetic meter. It usually goes off at night once about every 4 to 6 months but never this loud and long(1 minute). I've never ran outside before because I'm a sleepy head, but this time I lied there awhile listening and thought something was hovering over my condo because the field was so strong. Then I ran out side and saw nothing, but my field of view is small due to other buildings. By the time I got back inside my meter was quite. I had a major sighting of a ufo in 1975 , thats the reason I now always sleep with a magnetic meter.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Saw very large object emerge from behind a hill in front of me on 408 Spur.  Long row of lights too bright for me to see shape of craft;1999-12-28 02:00:00;1-2 minutes;Saw very large object emerge from behind a hill in front of me on 408 Spur.  Long row of lights too bright for me to see shape of craft. I was traveling South on 408 Spur at approx. 2:00 A.M. in late December 1999.  I was approaching a large hill which sits just off the Spur on the West side.  I noticed very bright lights moving in the trees along the top of the hill and moving in Easterly Direction.  My immediate thought was, Hey, there is someone driving through those trees up there. I've never seen anyone driving around up there.  Must be someone doing off road stuff.  Wow the lights are bright, could be more than one driving around up there.  As the lights got to the East edge of the hill where I wondered if I would be up to the hill in time to see them drive down toward the highway, suddenly the lights just came out from behind the hill in the air!  I did not expect that!  A string of very bright lights emerged slowly and stopped directly over the highway up ahead. I would estimate the length of the object to be about as long as Texas Stadium!  I could not see the shape of it or the sillouette of it for the brightness of the lights.  I continued driving but was stupified at what I was looking at!  After it stopped, it reversed direction and proceeded to go back the direction it came from. (West) It disappeared behind the hill and very quickly I arrived at the spot where it had stopped over the highway.  I looked to my right expecting to get a good look at whatever it was and all I saw was the lights of Grand Prairie, Arlington, and Fort Worth spread out in all their spleandor!  There were no bright lights. There was no object.  If it had been there and had just turned its lights off, I would have seen a sillouette with all of the city lights .  It just vanished!  I have been driving home from night shift for 13 years and this is the one and only strange thing I have seen in the air! My main reason for reporting this event at this time is just to edify you in your investigation.  In case you received another report from someone else concerning this same event and my report could corroborate their report.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Dark immobile object in the afternoon sky;2001-07-28 11:30:00;10 Minutes;Dark immobile object in the afternoon sky I was sitting on my porch at 11:30 AM when I noticed a black dot in the sky.  I would not have seen it except that it was in front of a cloud that made it stand out.  I watched it for a moment and noticed that it wasn't moving.  I sat there for about 2 or 3 minutes watching it and then I decided to run out to my truck to get my binoculars.  It took me about another minute to find the object again.  It was still in the same place but the clouds had drifted away making it harder to see.  Looking through my binoculars I could tell that it had a shape similar to a stealth aircraft but it was so small that I can't be absolutely sure about that.  There was also a haze around the object, like when you look through gasoline fumes.  I went back to my porch and had a hard time finding it again.  I spotted it once but I lost it while trying to find it with my binoculars.  The entire episode lasted about 10 minutes and I never saw the object move.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

We were trying to make out the constellations when all of a sudden I saw a very bright light in the sky.  It looked as if it were a falling star but I don't think they move that slow.  I've seen a falling star before and they move in a blink of an eye.  Anyway, the light seemed to be moving slowly for about 10 seconds until it just disappeared.  I thought it was a shooting star but now I'm not sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

On July 7, 2005 at about 11:30 at night, I noticed a bright light that sped across the sky, and was visible for a couple seconds.;2005-07-07 23:25:00;a few seconds;On July 7, 2005 at about 11:30 at night, I noticed a bright light that sped across the sky, and was visible for a couple seconds. I really did not have a clear view, or I wasn't 100% sure this was a UFO.  As I was sitting in my seat and looking out at Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport in Texas, I saw a light in the sky, it just appeared nearly suddenly, and within 4 seconds it was gone. You could say I saw it, blinked, and it was gone.  It looked like it was at a high altitude.  We were on board American Airlines flight #2262 (a Boeing 757), enroute DFW-STL, at gate C11 awaiting gate departure. It was about 11:30, probably a little before that.  I knew what I saw was too fast for any plane, even a military jet. I could only see a white light, no other color lights. I know it couldn't of been a shuttle because those have been grounded since early 2003. Whatever it was, it looked like it was going to escape the atmosphere very shortly.  There were no stars that were visible, since there were many lights at the airport, so I know I didn't mistake it with a satellite. It was too low to be in space yet, but getting close to escaping the atmosphere. The light was easily about 35,000 feet, I would have to say anywhere from 50,000 to 150,000 feet. I'm sorry I cannot be specific on the altitude of the aircraft, or whatever it was.  If I had to take a guess, I would have to say it was around 80,000 feet. Again, the date was July 7, 2005, and the time was probably about 11:25 P.M. We were at gate C 11 (terminal C gate C 11) on the ground at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Its bottom appeared as three dimly illuminated elongated octagons, one in front of two in tandem.;2007-08-13 00:25:00;10-15 seconds;Its bottom appeared as three dimly illuminated elongated octagons, one in front of two in tandem. 8/13/07 UFO Sighting, Dallas, Texas  On Monday morning, August thirteenth of 2007, I was lying on my back on a lawn lounger cushion up on top of my carport about midnight, prepared to spend the next five hours watching the second night of the meteorite shower.  I had a cut-out cardboard box around my head to block out the street & residential security lights in the neighborhood, making my view of the clear but hazey sky quite clear.  I had laid there admiring shooting stars when at about 12:25 AM a small airplane flew North over me in Oak Cliff, a suburb of Dallas, Texas.  Its North-South trajectory was about a few blocks to the West of my position.  I imagine it to have been following the path of Westmoreland Boulevard.  Before I could see it, I remembered the noisey little airplane by its distinctive sound, since it flies North and/or South over our house frequently at night, always disturbing my sleep.  It triggered the usual question: why aren't such airplanes required to muffle their noise, especially at night?  As it passed over my line of sight, I noticed something following it.  I first thought the plane was towing something behind it, because the object behind the airplane was traveling the same speed and at approximately the same altitude.  It was so dimly illuminated it was hard to see.  It's image area was about six to eight times larger than the small airplane's image area.  All I could see of it was three elongated octagons (rectangles with the corners cut off).  Their lengths ran the direction the craft traveled.  The octagons were in a common plane, two in the back and one in center front, evenly spaced apart in a triangular formation.  It was about one to two hundred yards behind the small airplane and slightly to the West of the airplane's trajectory.  It flew in a straight, level line without deviations.  Either the small airplane was making so much noise that I couldn't discerne the object's sound.  Or, the object was making no noise at all.  The object's three elongated octagonal panels were either very dimly: but evenly illuminated, or they were finished with a non-reflective or ultra-flat coating that evenly diffused their reflection of the city's ground lights over their surfaces.  No sharp ground lights were reflected off of them as it passed over.  And, I don't know if it was a single craft or three individual aircrafts flying in continuous and perfect formation.  I stood and turned around to continue watching it and the airplane as they flew away from me, to the North toward Love Field.  As they dissappeared in the misty distance I couldn't descerne anything about the object's shape.  As the three panels became flat in the distance, the whole thing seemed to dissappear.  But, I could still see the airplane's blinking lights and barely still hear the airplane's noisey exhaust.  I immediately went downstairs to write down and sketch what I'd seen.  Just after one o'clock I called Love Field Tower.  A recording gave me a night phone number.  I called that number at 1:10 AM.  Someone named Gary answered the phone.  I briefly described what I'd seen.  He said he was on the field and to call him back in twenty minutes when he'd be back in his office.  I called him again at 1:30 AM and again told him what I'd seen.  He said he'd talked to the tower and they'd heard nothing from anyone else about it.  I reminded him that the tower's nightn phone number isn't even listed, so the public couldn't have called the tower unless it was a relative or other airport official who already knew the tower's night number, deducing that HE would be the only one to have recieved any calls about it.  He completely ignored that.  It seemed as though he was partonizing or attempting to placate me.  He didn't seem genuinely interested, failing to ask for my name, phone number or any information about the sighting that I hadn't volunteered.  I asked him if there is an official phone number where such sightings are supposed to be reported.  He said, No, that I'd called the right number.  So, I appologized for bothering him with such ridiculous nonsense and hung up.  I was left feeling disgruntled, unsatisfied and embarrassed.  Now, that I know the National UFO Reporting Center is listed in the FAA Manual as the correct place to report unusual sky sightings, I'll call ole doubting Gary back tonight to provide him with the NUFOREC's phone number, remind him to read his manual and give him a free piece of my mind.  I saw a similarly unusual flying object many years ago (I'm bad with past chronology) several miles East of Tyler, Texas.  It was deep in the dark piney East Texas forrest.  The night was clear and the stars were amazingly bright.  The thing appeared to be a sharp triangle, only distinguished by it's blocking out the star's light behind it as it passed over me heading East.  It was moving too slowly, in my opinion, to be an airplane.  It didn't exhibit the three elongated octagonal shapes on the bottom.  If it was the same type craft, I suppose this was because there was no ground light to illuminate them.  It was exactly the same color and intensity of the background night sky.  It, too, made absolutely no sound.  And, I was alone then, too.   I seriously doubt these craft were man-made.  And, I no longer have any doubts that we are NOT alone on our God-forsaken, bloodthursty, demockery-cursed, predatory little planet.  So, perhaps there is hope for Us good Earthlings, afterall!;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

As I look at the dipper, not sure which one but it was a dipper.. a series of lights appeared.    As I watched these lights flying in a V-Formation I couldn’t believe my eyes.so I ran inside grabbed my wife.   And showed her the lights.  We both looked in awe.. as the objects was flying.. it then broke into a straight line   > ..   < indicated by the arrows.   This is the formation that the objects flew in, then the middle object took the lead and it then became a V again.  As I looked closer and watched and watched this wasn’t a huge massive object.  It was at least 15 small specs.. moving in a synchronized pattern..  It was so far away that the dots looked exactly like stars.   It took about 1 minute for these objects to fly completely across the distance of the sky and out of the horizon at exactly at 11.50 or 11.53 close to those times. These objects appear.. clear as day  if anyone was looking in the sky over Dallas around this time it was almost impossible to miss.. as it flew across the sky in blended in with the stars.  Then re-appeared again same formation same speed a constant movement I don’t know what we saw but we most definitely seen something flying into the bowl of the dipper and proceed to fly across the sky..... the color was specs.... the same color u see when u look at a star...... the objects were flying in a SE direction directly over the Northern part of Dallas....close to the highway of 635 right before the city of Garland;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Strange metallic, possibly triagular or pentagonal shaped, single object in sky above Dallas, TX on 8-19-21;2021-08-19 18:00:00;2 minutes;Strange metallic, possibly triagular or pentagonal shaped, single object in sky above Dallas, TX on 8-19-21 We were in the backyard on the evening of August 19th, 2021. We saw what we initially thought were three different planes flying in the sky, one small, privately owned plane low flying, and two commercial planes that appeared to be at cruising altitude. We quickly realized that one of the commercial planes did not look like a plane at all. It wasn't shaped like a plane, and it wasn't moving in a normal, uniform way. It also came from a very high elevation, to a much lower elevation, in an unusually short amount of time. I ran in to grab binoculars, and through the binoculars, I saw something that was unusually shaped (possibly diamond/triangular/pentagonal shaped), and there appeared to be 4-6 lights/engines/something glowing, eminating from the shape, but we didn't see anything that looked like a heat signature, or any other signs of propulsion. It appeared to be a silver/metallic shiny object. One of us thought the shape had a haze around it.  When I gaVe the binoculars to the other person, and I looked back, the shape/craft/thing was gone.  We only saw the single object, but the sky also seemed to have silver flashes occurring while we saw the object, but that could have just been glare from the sun. It was a perfectly clear sky, and the sun was still shining. The two people that saw this object are both college educated, and have professional occupations. Neither people have ever seen or reported anything like this prior to the 19th.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
