Somethings out there;1976-10-30 16:30:00;16:40;The hi-pitches noise is what first alerted me to the disk. My family was watching t.v when the t.v started static and picture problems. The lights started blinking from dim to bright.My dogs were whining and scratching the back door wildly.Keep in mind my German sheperd had been qaurentine twice for biting people riding or walking ddown the alley.As well as a mean standard poodle. I went to let them in the house and when I opened the door they ran me over peeing and pooping as they crossed over me.The noise was very hi-pitched.I was 13 yrs old.My first reaction was to run where they did under my bed. I went as far as the bed room and ran back to lookfor my mom and brother. The front door was opened and I went to the porch and our neighbors and my mom and brother were all looking in the sky. I looked up and saw a huge disk shape houvering above the neighbor hood. It was so huge it could have destroyed at least two blocks if it landed. Now it gets even stranger.It is dark outside the sky is just a shade of dk blue but not quite black. The ship is almost the same color or a shade just lighter from the color of the sky. I'm histerical and run in the room where my dogs are. I grab the phone to call police,my dad anyone because I'm scared but remember I have to go getmy mom and little brother. The sound of the ship is head jolting. I ran to get my mom and brother in the house but they just stair in the sky. I grab my neighbor hand and tell her to run. But could'nt budge her. I ran back to the porch behind the bushes surrounding the porch and look up in ahh. I notice that it is round in shape like a washer that goes on a screw then criss-crossing are bars that connect to the center of the disk which is like a black smoke-glass sphere. It didn't have windows and I would have to guess maybe that the center was like a smoke glass marble and they were watching us. Anyway, the outer part begin to have lights red,green,yellow,blue four in a row from my angle i could see blinking at the front side and back of the ship. They blinked in a harmony like way. Then as it went higher u in the sky it's shape seemed to change and the criss-cross bars went in and the disk was smaaler in size and it went up and shot ahead in the sky so fast it was gone. I ran out into the yard where everyone seem to be calm and alert. I was screaming did you see it lets call someone. And mom said calm down it's time for bed. Pat the neighbor was telling every one good night. I was alarmed that everyone was so calm and non-shalaunt about the situation.The next day my mom the neighbors all of them said they didn't remember seeing anything last night. But they couldn't explain why my legs were all scratched up from the dogs running me over in the kitchen and the back door being almost scratched in too from the dogs. I've told this story to every one I know and they just look at me like I crazy. And as god is my witness, I've been when three of them and together they witnessed again another ufo sighting. Do they keep an eye on you once you spot one of them. I've never seen a allien, but I  have seen at least three other ships since I have seen that one at 13. One had three lights and was triangle shape, one just a blue sphere never loosing altitude and traveled in a perfectly straight direction. and yet another like jacks shaped. You know the jacks and ball little girls played as a child. With light on all five ends. They were at close distances and was also a bit over whelming even as I am now a adult. I had the same fear rush threw me as I did as the 13 year old girl who seen the mother of all ships. Nothing has ever come close to the sighting I seen at the house in Dallas,Tx. Whats even stranger is..... Since 1998 I have had a series of dreams.That seem to be messages from alliens. They were very clear and in color that was so bright. Over a two year period I had five that were so real. I have to question if they are related. One thing I am clear on is this. Somethings out there.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
While inbound on Amer. Airlines Flt. 1409 from Atlanta to Dallas, just north of Dallas, @4,000 feet, I saw a small disk like object 2'x;1998-05-29 04:45:00;6-7 seconds;While inbound on Amer. Airlines Flt. 1409 from Atlanta to Dallas, just north of Dallas, @4,000 feet, I saw a small disk like object 2'x 2'. I am a successful medical diagnostic ultrasound and video endoscopy distributor in Dallas, TX.  On Friday, May 29th at approximately 2:45 pm, I was returning on American Airlines flight 1409 from Atlanta to Dallas.  We landed from the north at DFW.  About 5 - 10 minutes before landing, I was watching attentively out my window when in front of the aircraft, at about the 2:00 position in the sky, I saw a metalic silver and navy blue disc like object.  It was about 2 feet high and 2 feet wide.  It may seem odd that it was disc shaped with these specifications, however, it was almost as if it were segmented.  Imagine a disk about 8 inches with squared off sides sitting on top of another disc about 16 inches wide, sitting on top of another disc about 24 inches wide.  Under the 24 inch wide disk sits another 16 inch disc and under it another 8 inch wide disk.  The top and bottom and each side were symetrical. At first I though it was a bird, but a couple seconds latter in came into clear focus as we flew only about 200 feet away from it.  It was on the right side and roughly the same altitude, about 4,000 feet.  I am familiar with altitude as I have about 20 hours of flight instruction. It was definitely the most uniquely mysterious object I have ever seen, and I can't think of anything to explain it.  I believe it was either moving slowly or not at all.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
An UFO staying on the skjy with half red and half orange.;1998-10-15 23:00:00;10 seconds;An UFO staying on the skjy with half red and half orange. I drove the car from Dallas to Oklahoma just out of town (Dallas) I saw a disk staying on the sky around 30 feets from the highway.  That night was cloudy and there were not so many stars and no moon.  A disk with two strong color half red and half orange.  My friend also saw this disk and we decided no to stop and drove directly to Oklahoma. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
A huge multi-lighted object hovered stationary over the eastern part of DFW airport.;1999-03-22 21:45:00;30-45 sec;A huge multi-lighted object hovered stationary over the eastern part of DFW airport. I was walking my dogs at 9:45 pm local time.  Heading east along the backside of my apartment complex.(This faces DFW airport which is approx 4 miles away)  I walk my dogs this direction on a regular basis and am quite familiar with the flight paths of the airport.  I noticed a multi-level bank of lights approx 500-1000 ft above the ground.  At first I thought I must be seeing a top of a building.  However, I realized that there was no building of that height any where in that location.  As I continued to observe the object I noticed that it had some kind of blinking lights.  I attempted to climb a fence to gain a better vantage but was unable to gain any better view.  The night sky was clear.  I continued to observe the object for several more seconds.  At no time did it move.  I would estimate it was 20 times the size of a commercial aircraft. At no time was there any movement.  At the time I was unable to really comprehend what I had observed.  I began to return with my dogs to my apartment.  Before I arrived I began to shudder and sweat. Realizing that I had witnessed an unusual occurance I return to the location where I had observed the object and it was gone. I walked around the complex seeking to find anyone whom might have observed the same thing.  I couldn't find anyone.  I spent the next hour or so returning to the site where I had observed the object, I also drove to the area I felt it had been located to see if by chance there was a building or anything to explain what I had seen.  There was nothing.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Enormous silvery disk hovered for 3 minutes above Dallas Love Field airport (~10,000 ft).  Two unmarked black copters pursued.;2000-05-25 15:15:00;3 min.;Enormous silvery disk hovered for 3 minutes above Dallas Love Field airport (~10,000 ft).  Two unmarked black copters pursued. Coming back on bus from team building retreat.  Heading north on I-35.  Observed 2 large black/dark green helicopters with 2 propellers front and back flying south app. 500 ft altitude, offset by 1-2 copter lengths.  No markings.  Director of global support sitting in seat in front of me.  I said, ((name deleted)), look at the military helicopters.  He was on the cell phone.  Most others were asleep around.   At this point I noticed a huge silver disk shaped object, metallic in nature, brilliantly reflecting sunlight, hovering at about 9-10,000 ft. above Dallas Love Field airport.   The copters were flying directly toward it.  ((name deleted)) then looked at the copters.   I said, what is that above them.  He said, something is flying above. I said, I think it is a UFO.  At this point, we both stared out the bus window transfixed.  I was determined not to take my eyes off it.  I should have yelled UFO, because there were at least 5 video cameras and 20 cameras on the bus, but I couldn't take my eyes off it. I know the object was extremely large, because eventually the helicopters were directly under it, in the same formation, and the diameter of the disk was larger than from  the back of the trailing helicopter to the front of the leading one.  This was actual, not apparent.  and the copters were about 8500-9500 feet below.  I haven't done the math on this yet, but if the length of that type of copter can be found, a reasonable estimate of the actual size of the craft can be derived.  It was magnificent and beautiful. About 30 seconds after the copters were directly under it, it disappeared.  I wasn't even blinking, let alone looking away, and it simpy disappeared. The copters were out-of-sight in a few seconds after.  Note:  altitude estimate derived from knowledge of meteorology and the apparent shrinkage of the copters as they approached it, time of day, and relative sizes of airplanes coming in and out of Love Field.    Sunny, sparse fair-weather cumulus clouds.   I work for a Swedish telecom company (16 years).  Job title: Master Engineer.  This event happened yesterday afternoon.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
White Daytime disc in north Dallas on Election Day.;2000-11-07 17:50:00;2-seconds;White Daytime disc in north Dallas on Election Day. North Dallas, I had just completed voting and was walking home from the polling place, Hillcrest High School, Dallas. Full cloud cover, only small patches of blue.  I was walking on the side walk and thinkng to myself this is the kind of day you might see a ufo.  At that moment I was kind of scanning the sky almost above my head and just to the right, I was faceing east, and saw a totally white ufo it was just ducking behind a cloud. It was the size of my pinkey nail when held in front of my face as compaird to the ufo. The cloud layer was fairly low. It has been raining for two weeks here. The ufo moved fluidly with stability and no wableing or sound. It was the color of the clouds around it but just a bit more white. I,m sure it was intellagently controlled because of the speed that it was moving, and it seemed to take evasive moves when I saw it and it saw me. I have seen one of thies white cloud ufo's  before. That one was in Arizona about 4 years ago around Flagstaff. I see ufo's fairly frequently and I told my self that I would report the next one. Please excuse the spelling I am dislexic. Thanx. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what 2530 hrs. is.  We will attempt to confirm the time of the sighting.  We assume the witness may mean 1750 hrs.  PD));32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Disk Tries to Hide;2001-06-15 16:00:00;20-30 Sec.;Disk Tries to Hide Background.Degreed Electrical  Engineer,Jet fighter naintenance experence in the US Airforce. Bird watcher with  over 170 birds identified in the field. Also amature astronamer with over 100 hrs. at the eyepiece. What I Saw: Was using my new binoculars to watch airplanes. I was following one plane that was leaving a normal contrail. And this sounds odd I just stopped and the plane flew out of the field of view.I was just looking at the contrail and I didn't know why. Then I thought maybe I had seen something in my Perifial Vision. I start to search.I moved the line of sight up maybe 3-5 Deg. Bingo! A round perfect disk made of cloud but the edges were sharpit wasn't a cloud.I blinked it was gone. If it wasn't so oddI'd think it was trying to camoflauge itself.

November 2001 Dallas, Texas UFO sighting downtown;2001-11-28 13:00:00;2 minutes;November 2001 Dallas, Texas UFO sighting downtown On the date in question, of which I am certain because I entered in my desk calendar, I am not certain of the time. But, I think it was about an hour or so after lunch because the remainder of the day on my calendar is leave (I remained at the office, I just could not perform anymore duties because I was a bit shaken).  The weather was overcast and it had been raining a bit. As I was looking out of my office window (building located downtown ), I saw a flat dark, grayish object appear just above the buildings about 4 blocks N. of my office bldg.  The object was flat, with an odd sort of rectangular shape.  It definitely was not a helicopter.  It flew very close to one particular highrise, a building I usually watch because it frequently has window-washers cleaning the windows, and it is one of just a few buildings in the center of the view from my office building. At first I thougt the object was a plane.  Then I thought I was seeing things, because it did not fly by, but rather just circled the building in question.  It then hovered near the top of the building as if it were trying to survey it.  It did this long enough for me to stare for several seconds, then to get my glasses and stare for several more seconds.  The object the quickly speed off approximately due north.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
UFO SEEN AT A DISTANCE. ALTERNATED COLOR FROM SILVER TO WHITE IN THE SKY-DRIVING ALONG I20 TX.;2003-03-30 15:45:00;5 MINUTES;UFO SEEN AT A DISTANCE. ALTERNATED COLOR FROM SILVER TO WHITE IN THE SKY-DRIVING ALONG I20 TX. MY SISTER AND I WERE DRIVE FROM LOUISIANA ON SUNDAY 3-30-03.

White or Luminous Disk seen;2003-07-08 14:00:00;seconds;White or Luminous Disk seen I was coming back from class as I remember that this was the first day of class and it was a hot and clear day with big billowy cumulus clouds and dark blue sky. I rarely take notice of most things in the sky because usually it is just an airplane or helicopter as there is always so much air traffic in the sky.  On this particular day, I was travelling eastbound on Walnut St. in moderate traffic when I just so happened to see a glint in the sky that caught my attention.  What I saw, at first, looked like a plane but it seemed to be luminous or was a white color.  I would have dismissed it as a plane had it not rolled a couple of times and sped up as I watched it disappear into a big cloud.  When it rolled, I could tell there were not any wings or identification on it and it was about the size of an almond held at an arms length.  The time that it traversed over the sky, after it sped up, before it went into the cloud was approximately 10-15 seconds, before it sped up, I had noticed it for approximately 5-10 seconds. After going into the cloud, I had enough time to park but it never came back out of the cloud.  I wrote down this experience and called my brother and told him right after it had happened but I hesistated to tell anyone else.  The reason I am reporting this is that I feel that this report may be related to the Longview incident logged in on the same day of question.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
3-4 UFOs visit the DFW airport and disrupt flight schedules.;2005-03-05 19:15:00;45+;3-4 UFOs visit the DFW airport and disrupt flight schedules. Several airplanes were forced to repeatedly circle the DFW airport while 3-4 craft blocked the runways.  The crafts seemed to leave, but came back and hovered near the end of the airport once the airplanes started to take off again.  Planes taking off would have to bank a sharp right or left as the objects seem to intentional block their staight line of flight.

Three UFO' seen over Dallas, TX during daylight hours;2005-10-29 10:00:00;10 minutes;Three UFO' seen over Dallas, TX during daylight hours On the above referenced date, I was returning to my residence from a morning jog.  It was a partly cloudy day with mild weather.  As I walked facing the north just outside the gate to my residence, what I though was a very bright star suddenly appeared about 50 degrees in front of me.  As I looked at it, it moved quickly to my left and stopped.  It then rose slowly changing from a bright start to clearly a solid inverted saucer shape dark brown in color. It hovered and as I looked at it, I saw out of the corner of my eye a second bright star that moved in the same manner and direction.  It also stopped and rose slowly in the sky to the same altitude/height as the first craft.   As I stood looking at the two of them a third one appeared from the same spot in the sky and moved in the same manner as the other two. The third one, however, hovered without gaining altitude like the first two and remained in appearance like an extremely bright star.  They formed a V formation in the sky.  I stood in disbelief at what I was seeing and decided to call 911 on my cell phone to report what I was witnessing.  The first object moved slighly back and forth leaving straight lines behind it.  I felt that they knew I was watching them.   While I was on the phone with them, all 3 objects simultaneously moved behind clounds.  I stood there for several minutes afterwards, but never saw saw them come from behind the clouds.  I did get copies of my 911 tapes from the Dallas Police Dept. and DFW Airport.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
UFO spotted in air past DFW airport---not a plane or hot air balloon;2007-01-12 18:00:00;5 minutes;UFO spotted in air past DFW airport---not a plane or hot air balloon My daughter and i were traveling east on Illinois Ave across spur 408--when she spotted a very large round-oval shaped craft hovering over the skyline right below some clouds to the north. It was too large to be an airplane, and it didnt move for about 5 minutes---it just hung in the air and when we stopped to continue to look at it---it just took off straight into the sky-not like an airplane or a hot air balloon. It seemed to be in the Plano area or past DFW airport. It didnt have any lights flashing--it was just a very massive object hovering in the air.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Round object with 5 lights;2008-04-18 21:00:00;10-15sec.;Round object with 5 lights Around 9 PM, my boyfriend called me to our balcony to witness an unidentified object flying overhead. I got there just in time to see it vanish, heading roughly East to Southwest. The object was a round/disc shape, with 5 dim whitish lights on its outer edge. It seemed to either be a translucent dark color, or to reflect the surrounding clouds, which led to it looking 'ghostly'. It seemed pretty large. I'm bad at estimating altitudes, but we're on the direct flight path to the Dallas/Love Field airport which is only about 4 miles away so airplanes fly pretty low overhead (maybe 300ft). This object appeared to only be 2 or 3 times as high it was roughly the size of a quarter held at arm's length when it disappeared (possibly into the clouds). It was also traveling pretty fast. We heard no sound.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Disk or Saucer moving south to north in Dallas, Texas.;2008-05-28 17:30:00;2 - 3 minutes;Disk or Saucer moving south to north in Dallas, Texas. I noticed some very interesting clouds, partially hiding the sun and thought the picture would look nice on my screen saver.  I grabbed my 11 mega pixel digital camera and took three pictures.  The time between the first and second pictures was about 1 minute, and the time between picture 2 and picture 3 was about 30 seconds.  The next day I downloaded the pictures to my computer and noticed something I had not seen when I took the pictures.  You will see some kind of object on the far left side of the frame in the first picture.  It appears the same object moved toward the center of the frame in the next two pictures.  I was shooting due West and there are flight paths for both Dallas Love Field and DFW airport in that direction, but this does not look like an airplane to me.

Metallic like saucer perfectly still then travels at super velocity several miles, stops and returns, then disappears;2008-09-01 13:00:00;30 seconds;Metallic like saucer perfectly still then travels at super velocity several miles, stops and returns, then disappears I was in between a workout and looking out large glass windows of my gym south from a 4th floor gym.  Downtown Dallas is clearly visible.  I saw clear as day, a saucer like, grey metallic but not reflective object perhaps 45 degrees above my 4th floor elevation in the horizon and directly in front of me.  It took me several seconds to mentally register what I'm seeing because it was surreal.  The object was perfectly still and I'm guessing it was midway between my location and downtown and as a guess, perhaps 100 feet in diameter. I stared at it for a few seconds in disbelief and quickly turned around to find someone else in my area to point it out to.  I could not find anyone at all.  I went back to the window and it was still there for a few more seconds. Suddenly, it moved west (at seemingly the same the elevation) at such astonishing speed I could not believe what I was watching.  It stopped cold where I can still see it at a distance, perhaps several miles away.  It moved there in less than one second.  Note, I watched it travel that long distance (it wasn't that it reappeared there)..  Again, it stayed afloat for a few seconds. Then, it returned to the exact same place where I first saw it - directly above and in front of me.  It stayed there for perhaps 2-3 seconds and then it moved again at lightening speed due south (over downtown Dallas) at seemingly the same elevation and disappeared from sight. I was shaken by what I saw and frustrated nobody was near me to point it out and confirm what I was seeing. This happened a long time ago and will never forget it and have told no one because of fear of being ridiculed. I'm an electrical engineer and was as skeptical as anyone else but this experience has left me somewhat shocked and dismayed nobody else saw this or reported anything.  I looked for newspaper clips for a week but saw nothing. I'm compelled to tell my experience now because of recent articles on the topic and wanted to get this off my chest.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
It's back!  Second time watching a disk in the West sky with flashing red, white, green lights. Dallas, Texas;2009-06-19 23:45:00;20 minutes;It's back!  Second time watching a disk in the West sky with flashing red, white, green lights. Dallas, Texas This is the second time I have seen this disk with flashing red, white, green lights. First time was June 9th, 2009. Last night while sitting on my patio looking West, I saw it again.  Same color formations coming from underneath that rotated right to left which is what caught my eye.  No planes fly that late at night.   It sat in the West sky and moved slowly.   Eventually, it grew harder and harder to see as if traveling away.  Then it was gone.  This lasted for 20-30 minutes.   The first time I saw this craft was June 9th, 2009.  It was in the West sky but in a different area and not the same place as last night.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
UFO;2010-05-23 02:15:00;10 seconds;Ok, first of all I want to say that I DO NOT wish to gain popularity, money, fame, etc. from this, all I want is to let everyone know that there are very mysterious things going on and I wish I could know exactly what.  I just feel like I need to tell somebody now because what I saw was incredible.  I have told a few friends but I am most definitely sure that they think I saw something(I don’t care if nobody believes me, I know what I saw).   I love to watch the UFO television shows but I am the type that has to see something in order for me to believe so if my friends came up to me saying they saw something I would also may tell them I believe them but in the back of my mind I would probably think they saw something.  Well let me get started.  It was my friends’ birthday and we decided to go to the club 2009 in Dallas, Texas.  We planned on getting wasted and have a good time like we always do.  Well we got to the club and it was a normal night until I deci! ded to go out to the car and smoke a cig with my girl.  We got to the car around 1:45AM.  We were in the car facing north in the parking lot, I was in the passenger seat and she was in the driver seat.  We were having a conversation over something very old as we watched people walk by.  I remember looking at the security guard on top of the building patrolling, looking down, I guess to make sure nothing crazy happened,  it was around 2:15AM when out of the corner of my eye I saw  UFO floating from east to west as if to be a balloon.  As soon as I saw IT, I said “Look” to my girl and we both rushed out the car to look at the thing, we both are sure it wasn’t a plane or a balloon especially because of its lights.  When we stepped out it seemed to have stopped and it just started getting smaller as it went up and before I could process what the hell was going on, it was gone!  The overall time it was there was around 10 seconds.  Well I must say I was a little drunk but it was! n’t my first time drinking and in all my life of getting drunk! I have never seen things that weren’t there especially disk like flying objects.  I also want to say that WE only saw if for a small amount of time so I don’t want to give a description of it since it may be inaccurate but I do remember that it was circular and it had circular blue lights under it!  I also remember that it was kind of fat in the middle so it wasn’t a perfect circle or sphere, maybe egg shaped but like I said I don’t want to go into too much detail since I may be inaccurate.  All I know is that I saw something that I had never seen before and I really didn’t believe in that stuff but I now know that there is “something” out there.  The object made no noise and when it started to elevate did not leave a trail/aurora, nothing, it didn't shoot off into space either like on television, it simply elevated very fast.  I am also almost certain that the guy patrolling on the roof saw it but I’m not sure.  I also know it was around 2:15AM because my cousin called at 2:22AM a! nd by then I just kept talking about it and it had just happened. I also want to add that about 2 minutes after we saw the UFO we were standing outside(because I made my girlfriend stand by me just in case we saw something else) I was looking East of in the distance when I saw 2 star like lights moving up and down as if to be playing but when I told her to look they were gone!  That only lasted for about 3 seconds. If anybody has seen something similar I would love to hear about it and compare, I am really interested and excited because I now know we are not alone.  If you think I was too drunk or I am mistaken, NO! I know what I saw.  I wish I could have captured it on camera but I don't know why I didn't even think about it.
