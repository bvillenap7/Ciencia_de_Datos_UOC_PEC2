More than likely a shooting star, but thought I should report it.;1998-11-02 23:20:00;1 second;More than likely a shooting star, but thought I should report it. ** NOTE: I think this was a shooting star / meteorite ** Approx. 11:20pm (23:20) CST.  Irving/Valley Ranch, TX? Hackberry Road.  Approx. 0.5 miles West of MacArthur Blvd.  Approx. 1.6 miles East of Beltline Rd.  Approx. 0.5 miles North of I-635.  Approx. 5 miles North-East of, center of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. I was standing outdoors at the above mentioned location watching aircraft on final approach (landing to the South) at DFW Airport.  Looking approx. West-North-West, upwards at approx. 45 degrees, I witnessed what I belive to be a shooting star or metorite.  A very bright, greenish dot, streaked downward and faded.  The entire sighting was no more than 2 seconds in length.  The dot was very bright, white/greenish in color.  Could compare it to burnning magnesium.  The size of the dot was approx. 1/4 - 1/8 the size of the Moon at the time.  The dot also left a faint, whiteish trail behind it.  The dot moved in a straight line, straight downward (no movement across the horizon, i.e. South-to-North).  The dot appeared approx. 45 degrees above the horizon, streaked straight downward, and faded at approx. 10-15 degress above the horizon.  Its speed was extremely fast and constant.  It DID NOT speed up, slow down, change direction, hover, etc. The dot appeared to have faded above the Grapevine Lake / Grapevine,TX / Coppell, TX area.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Meteor lights up the skies over Dallas, crashes somehere to the south.;2002-10-11 20:36:00;3 Seconds;Meteor lights up the skies over Dallas, crashes somehere to the south. I was driving south on I635 in Dallas.  Straight ahead of me and about 45 degrees above the horizon a spot of light appeared, streaking straight down toward the ground.  Then it flashed brightly as if it had exploded, but then continued on its dowaward path unitl it got within about 15 degrees of the horizon.  At that point it faded out and disappeared. This entire event lasted only about a second. I just happened to be looking the right way when it appeared.  The object was white in color and left a straeking trail behind it.  There were aircraft in the skies over Dallas, and this light was much brighter than the lighes of air traffic and was traveling much faster. I almost expected to next see an explosion on the horizon, but there was none.  At first I feared that might be a rogue ICBM.  (Shows you what kind of times we live in now.)  When I saw no explosion on the horizon, I decided it must have been a meteor. Thinking it must have been a huge meteor, I turned on the AM news station to see if there were any news reports of the incident.  There were none.  I thought that I would certainly read accounts in the newspaper of many people observing the object--especially since it was so brightly visible in the middle of a big city. Surely scientists must have detected such a large object entering the earth's atmosphere.  And surely earthquake sensors must have detected the impact.  But over the next few days I saw no media reports at all. It may have crashed into the earth in the next county, half a state away, or into the Gulf of Mexico.  It was not a flying saucer, but it was certainly unidentified, so that makes it a UFO.  I have looked at reports posted on this site and I'm amazed that nobody else near Dallas has reported seeing this bright object.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
fireball over Dallas;2004-07-07 21:30:00;15 seconds;fireball over Dallas It seemed more like a meteorite, or a fireball than a craft, but I thought I'd report it just in case. It was heading North, and we were looking to the east from Garland TX (basically Dallas).  The front was a big orange and red fireball followed by a blue and green tail, bigger than a comet's tail.  I thought at first some one was shooting off fire works close by till I realised the distance and apparent speed, and then I thought it was a big meteor and when it went behind the trees, my friend and I both waited a second, holding our breaths, for the impact. It seemed really close.  Then I said, do you know how few people get to see something that cool?;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
NON BELIEVER TO FIRM BELIEVER FROM ONE ENCOUNTER;2004-10-15 00:00:00;20-30 minutes;NON BELIEVER TO FIRM BELIEVER FROM ONE ENCOUNTER me and a mfriend of mine were standing out front of my house smoking a cigarette and talking. We noticed a really bright light in the sky, about half the size as a dime in the sky about right in front of us. then 10-15 minutes later we noticed it was alot further to the left. We started looking at it periodically and noticed it was slowly moving horizontally across the sky but very slow. I don't know how close we were so I cant tell you exactly how fast it was going. All the time it was gradually changing colors from a bluish, to a greenish, to a yellowish color, i emphasize on the ish because the colors were changing so fast we could not make out one specific color at a time. Then we were both watching this light yapping about god knows what, probobally trying to figure out what it could be, when all of the sudden the light got really dim, then it flashed really bright while changing colors still and vanished from the sky for good. Then a week later the exact same scenario happend to a T. Same lights, same slow moving craft, same dim to bright and disapear action. Until then I did not believe in E.T's or UFO's, but since that night i've been reading alot and digging deep and now i'm sure what I saw is what I think it is. Sorry it has taken me this long to share this information, but you have to understand I am hard headed and it has taken me nearly this long to realize what I had seen that night. If you can, would it be possible to get a list of sightings and dates for the Dallas/Ft. Worth, Tx area. I am curios to know if anybody else in my area has seen similair things in the sky. my email is ((e-address deleted)).  thank you, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

Sitting in my condo I was facing the south southwest sky when I saw briefly a flash and a streak moving very quickly from above downward in a downward west angle/direction.  The streak seemed to stretch across the sky like a white line with a green light mixed in.  It's direction made it appear to be going somewhere southwest of downtown just past the trinity river.  The streak moved fast and only last a few seconds.  I initially I thought it was a plane, or something mechanical going down, but nothing was reported tonight.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Bright, neon-green fireball (or flare) falling towards ground slowly;2009-11-27 00:01:00;several seconds;Bright, neon-green fireball (or flare) falling towards ground slowly Roughly Midnight, I was at a aircraft gate and saw what appeared to be a bright neon green flare appear out of nowhere and float slowly towards the ground (as if it was simply dropped out of a plane). This occurred roughly southwest of the airport, but still close enough to be on the airport property. The intensity is what I'd expect from a anti-missile flare from military aircraft. The flare had a smoky white trail approx. ten times its own length (illuminated by the flare) as it fell. Lost sight behind a building, appeared to have hit ground. Unable to investigate further. I work daily at the airport and have not seen anything like this before. Upon reviewing the reports here, this appears to be happening regularly. I will ask ATC @ the airport tomorrow about this;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Bright, white, continuously burning light ball speeding over downtown Dallas.;2011-09-04 04:00:00;instantaneously;Bright, white, continuously burning light ball speeding over downtown Dallas. September 4th, 2011 -  Somewhere around 4/4:30 am, as I turned the corner onto a local street near my home,  a “light ball” sped overhead across the sky from behind my vehicle toward downtown Dallas (Texas).  The basic direction was from WSW to ENE - horizontally, and fairly low. This object consisted of a single, bright, white, continuously burning light. Size was indeterminate but it was rather large, much like a small meteor.  The speed would suggest a falling star or meteor and was out of sight as quickly as either, however, neither travel horizontally or as low as this object did.  It was far too fast to be a helicopter or airplane.  I had the windows rolled up and the radio on, preventing me from hearing any sound associated with this object. I considered the possibility that it may have been a street light reflection off the windshield. However, I turn this corner every single morning at approximately the same time and, not only have I never seen something like this before, there is no street light nearby. In my 55 years I’ve never seen anything like this and the hour may be prohibitive for many others to have witnessed this object.  I would really like to know what it was that I saw and if anyone else had witnessed it.  If this object was one of our own aircraft then it is something that hasn’t been made public and very advanced.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Orange Fireball in the sky;2012-01-23 19:30:00;45-60 seconds;Orange Fireball in the sky At approximately 19:30 hrs I was taking out the trash when I looked up into the night sky.  I noticed an orange colored fireball shape making its way across the sky.  Because DFW airport is near, I initially figured it was a landing plane however, there is no glowing orange landing lights of that I am aware.  I was unable to make out any directional lighting i.e. green and red wing tip lights.  It seemed to be moving faster than that of a plane.   So I watched it for several seconds, it made no change in direction.  The object from my perspective and location moved from a South Eastern direction to a North Westerly direction.   When a commercial plane on approach to DFW came into my view with its landing lights on, I was able to compare the two objects.  I was able to compare the light temperatures which were clearly different.   The size of the orange glow was much larger than that of the planes landing light. Although the orange object appeared closer to my location ! than that of the plane.  I was able to make out the directional green and red lights, in addition, the flashing strobe on top of the commercial plane in the distance.  The orange object did not have any additional lighting.  I also noticed that the orange fireball shape was moving away from my direction and away from the direction of DFW.  In addition, the orange fireball object appeared to be at a higher altitude than the plane. Once it was in the NW quadrant from my location the orange glow went out.   I was waiting to hear the whine of engines or growl of a rocket thrust and heard neither.  My only regret is that I stood watching in awe instead of running for a video camera.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Red/orange glowing, hovering orbs on 4th of July pre-fireworks;2012-07-04 21:20:00;5 minutes;Red/orange glowing, hovering orbs on 4th of July pre-fireworks On the 4th of July, I went to see fireworks with my 19 yr old cousin and my 9 yr old son at Fair Park in Dallas. We parked in a church parking lot at the corner of Gurley Ave and Carroll. Many other people were parked here as well.  As we were waiting for the firework show to start, I noticed two glowing, red/orange, slow-moving orbs, or what I first thought were fireworks.  They resembled Chinese lanterns floating in the sky, IF they had been on fire.  I was thinking, Why aren't they racing upward to explode like they usually do?   Why are they so slow?  I asked my cousin, What ARE those!?  Then we noticed they weren't going up, they were moving sideways, and I thought it was weird that they seemed to be caught in the wind and moving away from where the fireworks would be.  They were moving slowly to the Northwest, at approximately 20-30 mph.  Everyone around us was staring at them, trying to figure out what they were.  They were reminiscent of ta! il lights on a car, but far apart from each other.  Also, they were hovering rather low, which is the other reason I discerned they weren't fireworks.  Low, slow moving, and non-exploding. We watched them for no more than 5 minutes altogether.  I got impatient waiting for the fireworks to start and forgot all about them.  That is, until the next day.  My brother in law arrived at my house to pick up his kids and he sat down and said, I SAW something last night.  The kids were around so he was hesitant to go into detail at first but I instantly knew what he was talking about.  I told him to tell me what he saw, and he described EXACTLY what my cousin, my son, and I saw, and he lives at LEAST 30 minutes away from where we saw them.  And it was about the exact same time.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Glowing red-orange balls in the sky Dallas July 4th 2012.;2012-07-04 21:20:00;aprox 5 minutes;Glowing red-orange balls in the sky Dallas July 4th 2012. On July 4th, 2012 my cousin and I and her son went to a parking lot near Fair Park to watch the fireworks.  Shortly before the fireworks began, I noticed to red-orange glowing lights in the distance.  I was about to brush them off as someone in the nearby neighborhood shooting off fireworks, until they continued to move closer to where we were standing.   Mesmerized by them, I continued to stare, but managed to get a couple of quick photos with my cell phone.  They appeared further away than they actually were in the photo.  It would have been easy to dismiss these as Chinese paper lanterns, had they not been SO bright and moving sideways and not at an upward incline at all and it was not windy.  I turned for two seconds to say something to my cousin, and when I looked back to where they were, they were completely gone. The two of us had both completely forgot about this within minutes, until the next day when her brother in-law came to pick up his children and mentioned he saw the same thing, too.  Only he was at least thirty minutes away in Garland. The objects we saw are what I am thoroughly convinced to be UFO's, especially after seeing DOZENS of descriptions from all over the country describing red-orange bright glowing balls moving across the sky the evening of the fourth.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

It then came a little closer to us and the light started to flicker more and then it started to fade until you could only see a little silver thing moving away very quickly.

Brilliant glowing orange large fireballs, appeared to be 7, hovering over Dallas in a V shape formation, gets brighter than descends.;2015-11-14 19:05:00;20 minutes;Brilliant glowing orange large fireballs, appeared to be 7, hovering over Dallas in a V-shape formation, gets brighter than descends. I live in highrise building in downtown Dallas, TX.  At approximately 19:05PM I was looking outside my large ceiling to floor windows facing North towards Uptown/Arts District when I saw 7 large round orange bright glowing fireballs in the sky at a relatively low position in the sky. The 7 separate bright glowing fireballs appeared in a V shape where the first glowing orange fireball was the apex or point of the V shape. There were then 3 of the same objects on each side forming a V. They hovered in the sky, and one at a time the fireball would get larger and radiate more brightly like a orange diamond. I have never seen such a brilliant gleaming shining light in the skies as this. One by one, they took turns growing larger in size and brighter in appearance and then would slowly fade away as they seemed to get lower to the ground. I lost sight as they kept going lower because of a highrise building. This lasted about 20-30 minutes and they were stationed at ! the same position in the sky, a low hovering V shape position.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
