Ufos report in Irving, Texas, at 2200 hrs.  On or about July 1973 or 1974.;1973-07-14 22:00:00;6 minutes;Ufos report in Irving Texas at 2200 hrs.  On or about July 1973 or 1974. Myself and my mother her sister and daughter was watching tv waiting for the news to come on, at 2200 hrs watching wffa channel 8 news the reporter said, Folks, if you want to see something amazing go out side and look over the Dallas skyline which we did as well as most of the block. What we all saw was three objects looked like the size of a golf balls from about 9 miles from Dallas texas looking east.  At about a 1000 to 1500 feet above Dallas.  These objects was stationery each emitting different colors like blue gold red green silver.  It was rather superb looking.  After just standing there for about a minute each one started to do bizzar monuvers like one was zigzaging the other one was going up then down zipping from on side of the sky back and forth with the other two, at on point they formed a close circle and went spinning around at very fast speed. This lasted for about 3 min.  When the US Navy put a halt to the airshow as they scrambled two F-8 crusaders which at that time was hot alert aircraft, which ment they was armed with the sidewinder missile, along with the 50.cal guns.  They flew from NAS Hensley field out side of Dallas on the southwest just about 6 miles away, it only took about 20 seconds from the time they took off to get  over Dallas.  (I seen them as they left the air station only 3 miles away) never will forget how loud they was in full afterburner,  Just before they got on station, the three objects shot straight up in the night sky in a split second.  The F-8s made a few passes over Dallas before returning to there base. This left me with a impression that the ufos wanted to show the people what they could do, I know aircraft and it was nothing  that any aircraft or helicopter could do. Not only did my family see this but was reported by was channel 8 news along with hundreds of people I will say on thing this report is not a hoax I seen other sightings as well but none as this one.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Ball of light seen above full moon while moon was blacked out and then appeared again.;2012-01-11 21:30:00;30 minutes;Ball of light seen above full moon while moon was blacked out and then appeared again. Looking toward the South from my balcony, the moon was in &quotfull&quot phase.  It was a cloudy night and there were white clouds.  I observed something dark quickly passing from the top of the full moon to the bottom of the moon (like a curtain), completely blocking out the moon, then the darkening would go back up, and the moon would suddenly be visible again.  The full moon would be completely visible for only a few seconds, and the process of the darkening would repeat.  This happened several times for the 20 minutes I observed.  Also, there was a ball of white light (smaller than the moon, but larger than a star or planet) slightly above the moon.  Then all this stopped, the ball of light was gone, and the full moon was in full view.  I watched for another few minutes after that, and no more unusual events took place.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Thought that was weird and then saw it had no wingspan or contrail.  Then it just faded away disappeared in a clear sky.   Seconds later it reappeared briefly for a few seconds and then disappeared again not to return. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Thought initially it was a plane but was too low in elevation and not moving.  The craft was the size of a plane with 3 lights in a triangular arrangement.   Drove closer to its position and lowered my car window, the object was silent.  As I approached, I could see the oval shape from the light surrounding it.  The lights were red white and blue which made me think it might be a blimp for the 4th of July.   Then the craft ascended 15ft in one instant, stopped in mid air for a second completely still then lifted away vertically and disappeared.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
