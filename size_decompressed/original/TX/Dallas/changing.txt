3 hovering/slow moving objects in Dallas, TX, during rush hour.;2001-02-06 17:00:00;5 Mins;3 hovering/slow moving objects in Dallas, TX, during rush hour. I was walking into a friends apartment complex in downtown Dallas, TX, and looked into the sky and saw what I initially thought was someone parachuting out of a plane at a very high altitude. There were 2 objects in the sky at the time between 45 and 65 degrees off the horizon. One closer (the parachute) and the other was further away (what I thought was the plane). I thought that this guy was crazy because this was in the middle of Dallas and it was very high up. This was going to be on the evening news for sure. I ran inside and got my friend who came out and I showed him and what appeared to be a parachute. When I returned it changed into a circular silver/white object that didn't represent the first object that I had seen, but still remained in the same location. I was gone about 15 seconds. The two objects matched each other now in color, size and movement. I asked my friend what do you think it is.. He said a plane of course. We turned around and I showed him a plane in the sky that was moving at a high altitude 180 degrees from the location of the objects. No comparison. The two objects were moving very slowly together in a northerly direction. Their movements were very calm and not jittery. I asked my friend if he had some binoculars or a zoom camera. He brought out a Nikon 35mm with a non-zoom lens. I was able to capture pictures of the objects, but not as close as I wish. I captured several pictures of the two objects and as they continued to move slowly across the sky an identical 3rd object appeared. Within 4 minutes all 3 objects were no longer visible. The sighting lasted a total of 10 minutes. I was able to capture about 5 pictures. Pictures will be sent in this evening (I hope!).;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
My UFO sighting over the Immigration Rally in Dallas, Tx.;2006-04-09 13:30:00;5-6 minutes;My UFO sighting over the Immigration Rally in Dallas, Tx. It was all in the Immigration Rally in Dallas Texas on April 9th 2006 at around 13:30. Me and one of the people i was marching with saw this strange object changing shapes in the sky. We didnt know what the object was. We just saw it as a ballon or something. I jokingly said, look, bro , a ufo! we had a little laugh, not thinking anything of it. But the reason I am bringing it up now is because i was just curiusly looking at ufo pictures on the net (10/06/2006), and it was a ufo that looked exactly like what we saw on that day. I was overwhelmed when I saw the picture, and I immediately thought that some research area might want to know. It was a white cigarrette-like shape, except it moved around, and it seemed to make movements as if it was weightless (thats why we thought it was a balloon at first). It seemed to move like if it had no weight, like if the air was making it move. It was pretty high in the air, probably the elevation that a airplane would fly. The object didnt really seem to move location, it was just like standing still, like if it was just observing how the 300 thousand+ people were marching. At times the object would look like a horizontal cigarrette, and at times it looked like a bomerang like shape. It didnt seem like if it was changing elevation, just the movement of the object. Like I said before, I've held this in for about 6 months because i just thought of it as a balloon. The pictures I'm going to send are not from the Immigration Rally, but they're from some couple in Los Angeles. But the pictures are not of something that somewhat looks like what I saw, but they ARE OF WHAT I SAW, the SAME EXACT THING. In the pictures you can clearly see what im talking about when I said that the object changed shapes. Again these pictures are not mine, they were taken by a couple in Los Angeles. If ya'll have any question to ask me, please feel free to contact me by e-mail only at a_zenon08@yahoo.com . thanks for taking time to read my report. I hope it is to some help to! you guy s.  p.s.- has anyone else from Dallas reported you about this similar object?;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
White triangle  or cross with red bulging center elongates, glows, and disappears into clouds.;2020-07-25 20:30:00;1-2 minutes;White triangle  or cross with red bulging center elongates, glows, and disappears into clouds. While watching the Neowise comet in the western sky, my girlfriend told me to look at the moon. I turned around, and we both saw a triangular or teardrop-shaped craft flying at approx. 400ft from south to north. The craft was white, with a red area at the center. It initially appeared to be of matte material, to me, with no lights, though my girlfriend saw the white areas as lights. While she was watching the area around the moon longer than me, she claims the object only appeared after I turned to look, and seemingly appeared out of nowhere. The triangular craft flew directly over us.  When it was directly overhead, at 90 degrees, it appeared then as a cross shape, with the white areas as the long piece, and the red area as a crossbar in the center or slightly off center.  It seemed to elongate and grow brighter, or take on a sort of glow without changing color.  The object became a bit hazy as if I was looking at it with tears in my eyes, though my vision was clear. It then flew into a mass of cloud and never came out the other side. Though we both wanted to take a picture, neither of us wanted to avert our view.  I felt a weird shock of adrenaline.  We both feel like the sighting immediately afterward took on a dreamlike quality, and find trying to recall the exact shape of the craft difficult.  It's possible that it changed shape;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
