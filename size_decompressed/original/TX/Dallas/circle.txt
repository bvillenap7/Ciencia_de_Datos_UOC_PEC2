Stationary disk with lights circling the circumference of the object.;1973-07-15 21:00:00;5 Min;Stationary disk with lights circling the circumference of the object. I have told only a select few people about this incident, but seeing that another person reported something in July of 1973 in the Oak Cliff area seems to justify this.  I was 5 years old, and my parents ran a County Home for foster children awaiting placement in homes.  My family lived in an apartment connected to the facility.  I walked out of the front door of the facility and stood on the porch.  Above me was a circular craft with lights (green, red, yellow, blue, white) circling the circumference of the vehicle.  It was not a helicopter, as the lights moved slowly around the edge.  The only noise was a low, almost muffled, humming sound from the craft.  It held its position relative to me steady, with very little side to side movement.  I was young at the time, but my memory seems to be that the craft was approximately 45 to 55 feet in diameter, hovering approximately 100 to 200 feet in the air.  I ran back inside the building and called to my father to come look at the craft, and when he and I walked back out approximately 2 to 3 minutes later, the craft was gone.  My wife and my parents are the only people who have heard that story, until now. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Perfect Circle UFO Spotted at 30,000 Feet;2001-12-31 15:00:00;several minutes;Perfect Circle UFO Spotted at 30,000 Feet I was on an American Airlines flight 1566 from Dallas, TX heading to National Airport in DC.  Our takeoff time was delayed and we left Dallas at approximately 2:15 p.m. Dallas Time.  Upon reaching cruising altitude (33,000 feet), I opened my window flap (I usually keep it closed during takeoffs and landings). At that point, our plane is flying above the clouds with about 1/3 of the horizon and sky visible.  I cannot see land beneath the plane.  I noticed a solid white round object several thousand feet lower than my plane and located up to the North and East of my window (and the plane).  At first, trying to rationalize, I think it is a bird.  Realizing birds do not fly at 30,000 feet, I continue to watch the object.  It seems to hover or float.  Eventually, it is directly in line with my window (but at the same distance away.  I surmise that at 500 mph, we have caught up with it, and it has not moved.  Didn't see it move at that point.  Still it appears to hover. Then, rationalizing further, I think it might be a weather balloon.  I have never seen a weather balloon, though, so I am not sure.  No sooner do I process that thought, then the white object moves to the West.  It is still for a moment and then, shoots out in a diagonal of a north-westerly route and disappears in seconds into the horizon.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Saw a small bright object with fast erratic moves.;2002-06-18 14:25:00;about 1 minute;Saw a small bright object with fast erratic moves. I saw something in the sky between 2:25 and 2:30 while driving down 75 South in Richardson. The object was in the south/west. It was very small and very bright. Could have been the reflection coming off of it from the sun.  It was there one second then it made a couple of erratic moves and disappeared at a very fast pace.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

My wife didn't believe me on the first one,then a second came over this one was moving from west to east.We both saw this one,the time was about 5 mins. after the first sighting. Then a third one about 9:55 PM Central time this one again came from the Southwest going Northeast but at a 20 to 25 degree angle. No more were sighted for another hour or more.

UFO seen over north Dallas;2005-01-08 23:53:00;4-5 seconds;UFO seen over north Dallas My 12 year old daughter and I were walking west bound on Linden Lane in North Dallas area about 11:53  to 11:55 pm and we saw a sudden bright white light in the sky. We looked immediately...it was circular but not flat like a flying saucer, almost slightly oval in shape. It made a sound like part of it was twirling, it had some goldish lights, some looked slightly tinted with red, but most were white...it appeared to almost have tailights or lights inthe back of it...the sky was cloudless and very dark making visibility very clear...it seemed to pass into the earths atmosphere and then disappear, perhaps leaving the earth's atmosphere. It was visible for about 4 -5 seconds heading north northwest. I could probably draw an illustration of what we saw, it was that clear and visible.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Then for a minute or so I watched it move in a manner that a plane would not. It gradually moved away and/or became dimmer, finally disappearing completely. I live off of I-75 and Royal, object appeared to the Northwest at about 45 degrees.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
round bright light with wedge of red light on it. Stationary in sky. Larger than full moon. Not a plane. Not a star. Not the moon.;2009-06-28 22:00:00;1 second;round bright light with wedge of red light on it. Stationary in sky. Larger than full moon. Not a plane. Not a star. Not the moon. Today is June 28, 2009 at 10:20 pm. I live in Dallas, TX, near the Turtle Creek area, just north of downtown. I was driving home from a friend’s house about 10 - 15 minutes ago, going southwest on Turtle Creek Blvd. when I rounded a curve and up in the sky directly ahead was a huge lighted object, round, with colored lights. It had a large wedge of red and a large wedge of white light. It was bigger than the full moon, and stationary. The sky is dark. The moon is a bright crescent tonight -- it’s off to the north east, as I can see it clearly in the sky. I saw the object only a matter of seconds, as when I went under the trees and around another bend, it was gone when I came around again. This is the second time I’ve seen such an object in this area. The other time was several months ago, when I saw the same thing -- round object, large, with red and white lights. It was hovering over the boulevard and lasted for 45 minutes or so. I saw it as I was driving, and then parked and went up into my apartment on 12th floor. I watched it from my balcony. I am convinced what I saw was not a plane, nor was it the moon or a star. These sightings are upsetting.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Orb of light in far North Dallas.  ((NUFORC Note:  2 hours.  We suspect an advertising light.  PD));2013-10-18 20:00:00;2 hours;Orb of light in far North Dallas My roommate and I observed this  thing while on our nightly walk.  In a park in far north Dallas, we saw it and noticed it was moving in a tight circle that got larger and smaller.  We compared it to a stationary object to confirm that it was moving.  It made no sound.   And we could tell out was behind the clouds because it moved behind them, ruling out a search light.   Also the movement seemed interrupted twice as it seemed to shoot out a thin line of light, and again it separated in two and went back together.  It circled for two hours.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
