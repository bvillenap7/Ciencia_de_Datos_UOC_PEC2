Object was a single white light that came slowly toward us about 200 yards above our heads and stopped. It was a circular shape and made no noise at all.  After a couple seconds it shot off.  We had been sitting outside the old radio station at Buckner Childrens Home sneaking a cigarette.  We then ran back to our dorm and after asking each other what we thought we saw, we never talked about it again.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Fast moving light that stopped, moved backwards and took off again.;1979-04-04 06:00:00;5 seconds;Fast moving light that stopped, moved backwards and took off again. One early spring morning as I was waiting for school to open I witnessed a glowing blue light in the sky.  I was usually the first student at school and remember many mornings waiting for the janitor or the principal to open the school.  On this particular morning I was alone in the side of the school hanging around a ramp when all of a sudden I saw a fast moving blue light go by.  It appeared that it might have been a shooting star, but as it went by it stopped moved backwards and then took off again.  The light was round in shape and it left a white streak as it traveled.

I had gotten my youngest boy who was 3 at the time from the back of the seat while my wife took some things out of the trunk I turn around to ask my wife a question when I looked up, from a distance I could see three lights coming our way very low and slow,they were in a triangle formation. I asked my wife to look and what she thought about it she thought it was either 3 helicopters or 3 small planes. when they went over us I ask my wife if she could hear anything like roters or motor like a helicopter would sound. she said I don't hear anything we both looked at each other and quickly ran inside I told her we had just witnessed a ufo it took about a minute or so to to fly over us the objects were heading north. I was about to call it in but my wife said that they wouldn't believe me(police) but after reading all this, I'm sure there were other witnesses that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Bright light came out from behind nothing, stopped on a dime and then proceeded to fly back behind nothing... cloudless sky.;1995-06-06 01:00:00;10 seconds;Bright light came out from behind nothing, stopped on a dime and then proceeded to fly back behind nothing... cloudless sky. While on a Boy Scouts camping trip, myself and my friend were laying awake late at night on our chairs, which were laid out to the flattened position, so we were looking up at the stars and just talking about something. Suddenly, something that looked like a bright star came out from behind nowhere – (or more specifically, it looked like it came out from behind something like a cloud, but there were no clouds in the sky at all, it was perfectly clear) – and flew at a fast pace to a certain point, where it then stopped on a dime…. It sat still for a couple of seconds and then was suddenly moving again, headed in the same direction it was heading before it stopped, without any acceleration, it was just moving that fast again.  It then seemed to disappear behind something again, though there were no clouds in the sky. In short, it came out from behind nothing, stopped on a dime, and then proceeded on it’s path and went back to behind nothing again…  My friend and I both saw it, looked at each other, jumped up and ran to our tent.  That’s the only thing like that that I’ve ever seen and I’m glad my friend saw it too or I would have thought I imagined it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

As I was staring at the stars, something caught my eye.  I saw what looked like a far away star, but was moving around in fast motion.  Ive seen shooting stars, this wasn't one.  It would move around the stars like as if going through some sort of maze.  I told my friend about it and we stopped the car, and stayed starring at it.  When it got to the point where we couldnt see it we drove ahead to see if we could keep watching.  We were both amazed at the fact that we knew this was something out of the ordinary.  It had to be a UFO. The star looking object was of color white mixed with yellow. Two people observed this.  The object would manuever around the stars in a fast motion.  We saw this on our way home.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

I was flying into the DFW metroplex on the evening of Janua;1998-01-30 18:50:00;3.5 minutes;Time: 1850 CST location: 40nm SSW Dallas altitude: 6000feet I am a pilot. I was flying into the DFW metroplex on the evening of January 30, 1998. It was a clear night. At approximately 6:50 local time, I noticed what appeared to be a very bright star above and slightly to the right of my course. This object was very high and accelerating, albeit slowly. I thought that it was a meteor, at first. I noticed its acceleration and gave extreme notice. It was then that I noticed the second object ahead of the first and traveling in the same direction (north). The second object was much smaller and less bright. Both objects moved to within a few degrees of directly north. The first object began a slight, curving turn to the left and began to fade away ( as if to move into the earths shadow ). A few seconds later, the second object faded from view and with no turning noticed, as with the preceding object. They disappeared in the reference vicinity of two stars to the distant left and 'below' teh orion constellation. I notified a friend who was behind me by some miles in his aircraft (40 - 50 nm). He remarked that it was probably an aircraft, given the large number of them in the area. This was not possible. I have seen aircraft all of my life. These objects had none of the characteristics of aircraft and were either in the extreme upper atmoshere or in space. They looked very similar to satellites moving overhead. This is unlikely, in my opinion, due to the fact that the first object began a slight, parabolic turn to my left. Approximately 2 minutes after the initial sighting, the objects reappeared in the same fasion as before. They moved in the same fashion and direction as previously noticed. The smaller object was in the lead, as before. I noticed them this second time directly above. They moved in the same direction as before in almost an identical path. The fact that I saw them a second time is why I am writing this. If these objects were satellites, they would not have been seen twice, moving in identical fashion along the same route. During this second sighting, the! re was no turning motion seen. They were directly in tandem and some distance apart. My friend behind me observed the same phenomenon and stated that he saw the objects turn slowly to the right. I did not observe this. I did observe that they 'faded' from view in virtually the same position as before. They were not seen again. Approximately 2 minutes after the second sighting, I queried ATC to the effect of ' did they see two objects very high directly above Dallas aand at extreme altitude'. The response was 'negative'. I have a question for my reader-Does the space shuttle move south-north? Is it capable of retracing its path in a very short time, in what must have been a large distance? Can it turn in orbit to appear to be curving to one side? This is the only possible solution I can give. Given the fact that there were two objects, I am at a loss for an explanation.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

This was repeated 3-4 times then it disappeared. At about 17:45 on January 10, 1999, I was parked on Lake Lewisville just north of Dallas looking west. Just after sunset, there was a lot of air traffic as usual (I do this very often) and two high flying jets flying straight with long tails from southeast to northwest. These continued on their path for the full event. Just above the horizon at about 3 degrees, I noticed what I thought was another airplane with an orange reflective tail moving from northwest to the southeast. Looking at the map and from my previous experience, this craft was flying over Flower Mound and disappeared just north of DFW Airport. This one was very different from the other two. I got out my binoculars and followed it across the sky for about 15 minutes. It began zigzaging to the east and then back on course. During the zigzag, the tail got much larger and brighter. Then suddenly, during the last five minutes I saw it, a bright white light jumped in front of the tail (at least a few hundred feet or more) with the tail becoming much shorter. The light jumped in front of a rapidly dissipating tail at least 3-4 times and then it was just a light which suddenly disappeared. This event was not at any angle -- horizontal though it rose a bit as it got closer.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

April 27 sighting in Dallas TX.   Possibly the same object previously reported from Plano TX.;2000-04-27 20:40:00;10 seconds;April 27 sighting in Dallas TX.   Possibly the same object previously reported from Plano TX. I observed what could be the same object from the 04/27/00 Plano TX report already in the database. The object  was seen at approximately 8:40 pm CDT April 27 from the 4500 block of Fairway Ave. in Dallas, Texas, as I stood facing south towards the Crestpark Condominiums. This location is about 20 miles south of the original report from Plano. I saw a single white light at great distance moving extremely fast away from me towards the southwest (i.e., generally north to south).   I could only see one light and could not make out any detail of the shape, etc. It moved in a straight-forward (horizontal) line, as an aircraft in flight. The object moved much faster than a space shuttle moves upon re-entry (17,000 mph). I've seen 2 space shuttle flights returning at night from this same location within the past year. It was traveling at a steady pace (its speed did not change during the few seconds it was observed) and it quickly disappeared from view. I kept the object in clear view for perhaps 10 seconds. It did not appear to be a meteor because it traveled slower than a meteor. Also, it did not look like any space junk returning to earth (it was not burning, breaking up, like a satellite I saw reentering earth atmosphere in the 1970's). It moved much faster than any known airplane. It left no vapor trail behind as a rocket would leave at night (I saw one in the 1960's) and left no contrail like the space shuttle returning (again, I've seen these twice recently).  ============================================================   Report cited above from the National UFO Reporting Center database: Occurred : 4/27/00 23:38 (Entered as : 04/27/00 23:38)  Reported : 4/30/00 19:52  Posted : 5/3/00  Location : Plano, TX  Shape : Triangle    It was about 8:38pm CST, on Thursday April 27 when I witnessed the object. I met a girlfriend of mine in the parking lot of my  apartment complex, and while she was talking with my best friends fiance(they also live in my complex) I witnessed a triangular  object moving at incredible speed from the north to south. The object was lit on its underside in the shape of a rod, but I could make  out a black triangular shape outside of the lit area. I could see the object moving for about 3 seconds, then it seemed to just  disappear. There was no clouds in the area to hide in, so where it went is beyond me. The speed was incredible, in the couple of  seconds I witnessed it it covered a good portion of the sky. To compare in speed, I witnessed the space shuttle coming back in  orbit a couple of months ago, it took about 30-35 seconds to cross the horizon. If this object would have stayed visible it would have  cleared the horizon in less than 10 seconds. I was fully expecting to hear a sonic boom. My best guess of the size of the object is  about 3 times of the size of a 727(in comparison to a 727 flying at 30,000 feet, like this object appeared to be flying at). It definitely  dodn't appear to be a meteor, becuase of the color, size, direction of movement(it moved in a staight line). It was definitely a  strange site (sic).;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Erratic moving light beneath a Delta Flight out of Dallas.;2002-11-10 20:00:00;30 minutes;Erratic moving light beneath a Delta Flight out of Dallas. I was on a Delta AL flight from Dallas to New Orleans, climbing out of DFX over the eastern suburbs of Dallas.  I was seated well aft of the wing on the starboard side of the plane with a clear view of the ground.  I noted a light shining on the ground at about our 4 oclock position.  I at first thought it was a police helicopter shining it's searchlight on the ground.  It was traveling in essentially the same direction and speed as our plane (B737-800).  I suspected it may be a light from our aircraft, but eliminated that possibility when the light went under some scud...and the scud was back-lit.  It would reappear on the next opening in the scud. That happened several times.  We were in clear areas for long periods of time when it would look like it would do zig zags at right angles to our path and then return to the same direction as our path.  None of these manuevers were in tune with aircraft attitude changes, except for it's general direction.  I called it to the attention of a man seated next to me and he too followed it's progress and witnessed it going under a thunderstorm cell and reappearing on the other side of the cell as we passed by.  He too had no possible explanations for the light.  Once in a while it would flare out to a wider area like a flashlight being raised slightly, but most of the time it gave the appearance of a cars headlight shining down a wooded road..with the flashing as trees obstructed it.  The squared nature of its movements would also give the impression of a car going on checkered board roads.  But, we were now moving at a ground speed of 525+mph and at 30,000+ft.  The light would not be as bright going through towns, but one could follow it's progress through them in the same general direction and occasional zig zag.  It would appear more brightly out in the open country.  We came upon a real strong band of thunder storms and the light went under them and except for one break was not sighted again on the flight.  Clouds obscured the ground on the descent into MSY, ! but when the ground did appear, the light was not there again.  All in all, probably the most interesting flight of a flight filled life.  The thunderstorm band was spectacular, it was the night of the devastating tornados just NE of our flight path. ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the passengers witnessed.  If the report is accurate that more than one passenger witnessed the alleged light, and that it did, in fact, disappear behind clouds, then it could not have been a reflection from the inside of the aircraft.  Had it been a daylight flight, a possible explanation of the sighting might have been the phenomenon known as Broca's Spot, in which a spot is seen on the ground where the plane's shadow is cast, but this phenomenon does not occur at night, obviously.  We are confused by this one.  PD));32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

It was a bright sunny day and there were several other planes out leaving contrails in the sky but this object was just going straight upwards and it disappeared from sight in about a minute.  The object was almost straight upwards from where I was standing but I was facing eastwards when I saw it so I had to have been eastbound.  There were no markings on the object, it was not shiny, but just a dull gray or dirty white color, and it's speed was difficult to tell since it was going upwards.  Next, for the past two nights there has been a light that is stationary close to my school in Richardson which is where I go to school and work. If you look towards the west, you can see that it is about at a 45 degree angle with the horizon.  Both times that this light appears, there had been several witnesses both faculty members, staff, and students that have witnessed this light.  The object itself just seems to be a white or yellowish star that is out of place but has been seen in plain view at 5:45 pm and is extremely too bright to be a star.  The idea that it was a weather balloon seemed to be a more valid case but with all the wind that we have had these past days, I find it hard to believe that a weather balloon would be stationary for over an hour. There were several students that watched it until approximately 8:00 pm when I was told by them that it just left after a while.  When I asked how exactly it departed, the students told me that it left slowly towards the west.

Three bright round lights at high altitude hovering in the sky  adjacent the airliner I was in. Moved very little;2004-01-23 21:30:00;10 min;Three bright round lights at high altitude hovering in the sky  adjacent the airliner I was in. Moved very little I had just departed DFW International Airport enroute to Little Rock Airport, and we were passing through a Flight Level as announced by the pilot.  I noticed a bright round light in the distance.  Being an Air Traffic Controller I thought this was an aircraft at first thinking it was in a sequence to land with two similar lights behind it, but the lights weren't flashing like most lights on an aircraft at night do.  I thought then maybe it was in holding but the lights weren't really moving. This made kind of look harder at what I was looking at. I thought it kind of strange. They looked very similar to how bright lights are on top of a Radio tower or something but they weren't flashing.  Of course, it was way too high for a tower or a helicopter because of the altitude we were at.  By this time I am pretty sure were around FL 200 or higher. As we flew along what I initially thought to be a sequence into DFW started to look two of the lights came together and one was still in the distance behind it. These lights stayed like this for along time. The longer I looked the lights seemed to be in one spot the whole time.  THey were big almost round spots of light just hovering in the sky.  I looked around in the plane to see if anyone was seeing the same thing I was but no one was. These lights never really moved the whole time I watched and I stared at them til they were just tiny spots in the sky. They moved slightly lateral from each while I saw them.  They were not aircraft and I still cannot to this day figure out what it was.  I waited so long to report because I felt like people wouldn't believe me  or think I was kind of crazy, but after reading the report about the Mexican Air Force pilots and their encounter ( it was in the news not too long ago)...what I saw was very similar to what they saw.  I am not going to check any boxes below about being contacted but if anyone reading this wants to then they can contact me if they feel the need to;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

It was such a quick sighting due to the tree getting in the way.  I live near an airport and if it was a plane or some other aircraft i think i would have heard it easily. They had no sound.  If it were the way the moved  the speed and the formation they could not have been balloons with flairs.

I know I have heard about the satellite collision and debree, but I'm not sure if that is what I saw. I was standing outside with my dogs and looked Northeast...  I saw a fairly large flash of green and purple light. The light was changing shape from a ball shape to comet shaped. The light was bright green. The bright green was framed by purple light and it seemed to get brighter then darker, then brighter again. The light began to fall.  It was falling toward Earth and I don't know if it was light or an object falling to Earth...  It fell for about 10-15 seconds. And then dissappeared. I also lost sight of it behind the tress that line my street.  After that another light (similiar but smaller) also followed.  It was NOT a firework nor a shooting star ( too large and wrong color) and was BRILLIANT and solid light...  I live near a fairly busy street, so noise is everywhere..so I cant say that there was any sound accompanying it  It was just like 5 seconds and then as it fell. it dissappeared...  I am a 35 year old Paralegal in Dallas.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Large green self emitting ball of light with a cool silver center over a cemetery in dallas;2009-11-26 00:00:00;a few seconds;Large green self emitting ball of light with a cool silver center over a cemetery in dallas We were traveling southbound in my buds car, we saw at about 3 o'clock, degrees, in the sky a green light illuminate, travel downward, and disappear. it didn't appear to be a flare or firework of any kind, and it had a cool silver center. It seemed to be controlled by some form of intelligence, when it moved to disappear, it seemed to have moved in a downward parabolic motion as if to begin moving southbound.  The light we saw was conceived over a near by cemetery, i just thought that that was kinda weird. I have no idea weather or not it has a practical explanation, but this was definitely something i haven't seen before and didn't appear to be of this world. I, and my two comrades saw this.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
While driving home from work on I-635 heading W at about 10:05 PM I noticed a bright light in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));2010-07-04 22:05:00;30 minutes (approx.);While driving home from work on I-635 heading West at about 10:05 PM, I noticed a bright light in the sky.  It looked like an extremely bright star or possibly an airplane except that it wasn’t moving.   I kept my eye on it as I was driving and noticed that it still wasn’t moving and there were no flashing lights like you would normally see on an airplane or helicopter. It piqued my curiosity so I exited the highway and pulled into the parking lot of the Sports Authority store at Midway and I-635.  I parked my car behind the building and watched the light for 15-20 minutes.  There was a very light thin cloud cover this evening so most stars weren’t very visible and this light appeared to be below the cloud cover. At approximately 10:32 PM the light suddenly dimmed to a dark blue color and became difficult to see.  It stayed this color for 10-15 seconds and then faded out completely to black.   I could no longer see the object and I wasn’t able to make out any shape in place of the light.  It was the most bazaar thing I’ve ever witnessed in the sky.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

The lights appeared to be moving at a steady velocity for five seconds or so and then would dramatically slow down, seeming to reverse direction for a second. Then it would continue on the original course at the normal speed. This was seen to happen many times as it moved from the west of us to the distant NNE. It would have been easy to write this off as a high flying aircraft or possibly even a satellite if it weren't for the rapid changes in speed/direction.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Orange-Red Flying Object Vanishes In Mid-Air Over White Rock Lake Park, Dallas, Texas;2013-02-02 20:30:00;20-25 seconds;Orange-Red Flying Object Vanishes In Mid-Air Over White Rock Lake Park, Dallas, Texas On February 2, 2012 at approximately 2030 hours over White Rock Lake Park, Dallas, Texas, there appeared in the dark, evening sky an unusual orange-red light, or composite light.  The temperature was 55 degrees.  There were no clouds over this area of Dallas, and the stars were clearly bright and visual in the background.  There was virtually no light pollution over White Rock Lake this evening and the lake was still and dark.  White Rock Lake Park was mostly deserted in this area, however there were several other people walking along edge of the lake.  Apparently they did not notice the object. I was driving with my wife and south on West Lawther Drive on the West side of White Rock Lake.  White Rock Lake is rimmed with large residential estates on the West side of the park, all facing East and overlooking the lake.  West Lawther Drive winds around the perimeter of White Rock Lake Park on the West side. The orange red light was moving from the East to the SouthEast across the 65 degree horizon and in the general flight path approach for Southwest Airlines into Love Field Airport to the West of White Rock Lake.  There were other airplanes in the approach for Love Field Airport in the general vicinity over White Rock Lake.  The orange-red moving light was noticeable and unusual because there were no strobe lights or white lights as are common with commercial or private aircraft.  The orange-red light appeared in the sky at a 65 degree angle from the road and the light source was the approximate size of the commercial aircraft in the area.  The orange-red light was not moving rapidly, or erratically, but rather deliberately on a particular path and at a speed in common with the other aircraft in the vicinity. The orange-red flying object was not a star, planet or meteor. After viewing this object move through the sky and over White Rock Lake for approximately twenty seconds, the object faded and vanished in mid-air over the lake.  Upon closer observation, the orange-red light appeared to have a composite light source of multiple lights. Given that this area of Dallas is restricted airspace and in the approach path for Love Field Airport, it was highly unusual for any flying craft to have no strobe, and to have turned off its lights and or disappeared. The disappearance of the orange-red flying craft was not immediate, and it appeared to have diminished in size before vanishing, leaving one with the impression that the source of the light gained altitude at an unusually rapid speed and not on a trajectory common with traditional airplanes.  This process took less than several seconds. The sky was scanned for several minutes in an effort to locate the object, however this was unsuccessful. I am a graduate of the University of Virginia and Southern Methodist University and have experience piloting private aircraft.  I am familiar with the appearance of aircraft making an approach to Love Field Airport in this vicinity, and of the identifying lights required of aircraft, and can attest that this object was not a commercial, private or conventional military aircraft.  Furthermore, I have observed meteors, comets and other natural celestial phenomena and this object was neither. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thank you for the reply.  This was a very strange experience.  I intend to contact a few Southwest Airline pilots to ask around if any of their colleagues saw the same on their approach tonight.

An unbelievable and unforgettable experience to witness. Long Description of Sighting Report: My dogs were going crazy barking at back door, so I went outside, and that's when I noticed what I thought a very bright star.  It started to move closer and then away and then turned red and then back to bright.  I was also hearing a very strange sound, between a hum and maybe wind.  (I have never heard this sound before)  I first grabbed my IPAD to start recording it was not even close to what I was witnessing, so I ran inside and got my digital camera and started recording so I could the best view of this very odd object.  This object looked like a red disc spinning at times to a white dot.   After 2 min of recording I stopped to be honest because it scared me.  About 10 min Later it went slowly north from its location.   (As I look back on videos, a red light follows what ever direction it went).;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

It was in the general area of Love Field, so I assumed the lights came from landing lights. There were two lights in the sky one was much brighter and lower than the other.  The lights were white like a star,  but much too close to be venus or any star..... to me they looked like meteors coming in.   they didn't move at all for over an hour and a half.  I checked later in the night to see if they were still there.  It had become cloudy,  high clouds and I could not see any stars anymore. Any one else see this?;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075

Orange Light Pairs, 8 to 9-pm CDT, 10-28-2015.;2015-10-28 08:00:00;5 minutes;Orange Light Pairs, 8 to 9-pm CDT, 10-28-2015. On October 28, 2015, between 8 and 9-pm CDT, it was dark and I was returning from a 45-minute walk. I went through the Lake Highlands Baptist Church parking lot, at the intersection of Northcliff Drive and Parkhurst Drive. This Church is about 1-mile northeast of White Rock Lake in northeast Dallas, Texas. Directly to my southwest, about 20-degrees above the horizon, were about twelve orange lights, forming about six distinct pairs. The lights were each uniformly as bright as a full Venus, but were pure orange in color. No FAA aircraft navigation colors were visible, specifically white, red and green. The lights appeared to be over the Fair Park area, at about 5,000-feet in altitude and 5-miles distance. The span inside each pair was comparable to a 737, from wingtip to wingtip. Each two lights appeared to be mated, but I could not see any solid object between the lights. None of the pairs seemed attached with a different pair, as they slowly moved around independently. Each pair was separate of the other pairs and they appeared to be at various staggered distances. I only saw a flat-on view of these things from their northeast side, and do not know the other side. Another witness 71975 saw the lights from another angle and could give triangulation. A jetliner was directly behind the lights to the southwest at about 10,000-feet altitude and 10-miles away. This aircraft apparently left D-FW Airport and was traveling in a southeast direction behind the lights. The night was clear and the lights were steady for 5-minutes, so they were not natural phenomena. They were much too large, bright, high and stable to be Chinese lanterns. These were illegally hovering near a Love Field flight path, five miles south of the runway, for five minutes without proper navigation colors therefore, they were not man-made objects. These orange lights should have been easily seen by Love Field aircraft and traffic control and recorded. The pairs each slowly faded out one by one after about five minutes.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Single moving red light over northeast Dallas, March 8, 2016.;2016-03-05 22:15:00;30 seconds;Single moving red light over northeast Dallas, March 8, 2016. My house is on Parkhurst Drive near its intersection with Northcliff Drive in northeast Dallas, Texas.  I was outside in my back yard at 10:15 pm CST, on Saturday March 5, 2016.  Most trees were still bare of leaves, affording a good view of the sky.  To my southeast from behind the neighborhood housing, a moving single bright red light suddenly appeared at about 30-degrees elevation.  It was flying level at about 3,000-ft altitude and at about 1-mile horizontal distance from me.  It was traveling northeast, from my right to my left, along a path roughly estimated to follow Garland Road from Casa Linda Plaza to Whiterock Marketplace Shopping Center (Home Depot), where it then turned northward toward Lochwood Park.   At first, I thought it was a small airplane in straight level flight without much variation. Its speed was about 200-mph, too fast to be a helicopter.  I looked for any other lights, specifically white strobes and green navigation lights, but it only had! a steady intense red, visible from its left or port side toward me, proper for navigation.  However, since it is illegal to fly below 10,000-feet without white lights, I quickly inferred that it was not an airplane or other human construct.  No craft silhouette was visible because of the steady bright red light.  I purposely listened intently for an airplane sound, but there was only dead silence.  The craft then swung around from my southeast to my northeast, apparently making a 45-degree left turn, and headed along my northwest, keeping about 1-mile distance from me.  When it was approaching my north, I lost sight of it because of trees.  I watched it travel about 1.6-miles total distance and my sighting lasted about 30-seconds.  It was somewhat low key. I have witnessed several anomalous objects over Dallas within the past three years, but had not paid attention to any before 2013.  The different mindset that was forced upon me by my extremely vivid 2014 sighting has made me recognize that it is equally as important to identify UFOs as to discount them, and to not take a perpetually skeptical position.  It is a much greater crime to see a flying saucer and dismiss it as “swamp gas” than to see swamp gas and label it as a “flying saucer.”  When you see a light in the sky that does not behave like any normal object, it probably is not a normal object.  Therefore, my conclusion is that this particular craft was a machine that is NOT man-made, because – 1.  The lighting was illegal by FAA standards, 2.  There was absolutely no sound at all, 3.  The speed indicated a powered craft, 4.  The large scale ruled out an RC toy, 5.  The clock was late for normal small private airplane operations, 6.  The flight path curved around my position and! was not straight, indicating some ulterior behavior, which made no sense for human piloting over northeast Dallas late at 10:15-pm.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
Red light flying over Dallas, Texas.;2016-03-05 22:15:00;30 seconds;Red Light Flying Over Dallas Texas I live on Parkhurst Drive near its intersection with Northcliff Drive in northeast Dallas, Texas.

There is usually a very busy sky show of planes incoming and outward bound from the airport at this time of night, but I witnessed zero activity of this during the even.   The ‘lights ‘ were much brighter than I normally see and were stationarily stacked one upon the other with estimated 100 feet apart.   After about ten minutes, the topmost one faded away, to be followed by each of the others, about one minute apart.
