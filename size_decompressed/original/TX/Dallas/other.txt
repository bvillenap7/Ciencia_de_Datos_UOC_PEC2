long black pipe motionless over Dallas, texas;2019-09-27 10:00:00;3min;long black pipe motionless over Dallas, texas I was driving on the Dallas North Tollway just South of the 635  interchange. I could see out the front of my windshield in the air at about the 1:00oclock position this long black pipe. The object was motionless in the sky. I  am a private pilot and would estimate the altitude to be slightly  less than 1000 ft agl. I attempted to video record the object and caught the object just for a second on my cell phone while trying to drive.;32.8249235517248;-96.8004829559075
