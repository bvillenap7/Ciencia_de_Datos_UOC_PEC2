Three large bright lights in the sky, unexplainable.;2011-09-05 00:45:00;3 minutes;Three large bright lights in the sky, unexplainable. My wife and I were out in our yard letting our dogs out to do their business before we retired to bed. It was a clear night and nothing was out of the ordinary.  My wife was facing the back of the yard where our dogs usually go.  We have a small tree line that lines our neighborhood then leads to an open field. We were out there maybe a minute or so before my wife noticed something strange above and slightly behind the tree line.  She called me over to her position for me to observe what she was seeing. We noticed very large, bright lights stationary behind the top the the trees.  The lights stayed in position for several minutes.  They would blink out in sequence and then reappear in the same manner, starting from the left light working its way to the right. It was something truly unexplainable.  Keep in mind we live less than a mile from the Baytown Municipal Airport.  We observe planes and helicopters coming and going all the time.  We have a very clear view of them considering how close we live.  The object we seen was silent and was no more than 200 feet away and maybe a 100 feet in the air and was not moving. So, once we saw it for a few moments we rushed our dogs back in the house.  Grabbed the keys and a camera to drive to where this field was behind our neighborhood.  We arrived in a matter of seconds and observed for quite some time without seeing it again. I know it wasn't an aircraft coming or going to the airport.  It wasn't the moon, distant planets or any cell towers.  My wife is a total skeptic of the UFO and alien phenomena.  But this sighting has her scratching her head. We just thought we would report in case of similar sightings in the area.;29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178
