Disk shaped navy blue U.F.O emmiting light beams into sky in Baytown Texas;2006-09-27 19:00:00;3 min;Disk shaped navy blue U.F.O emmiting light beams into sky in Baytown Texas I was out setting up my reflector telescope when my cat was running north into a ditch. When i was removing the dust cap I suddenly felt a drawback of wind, so autimatically I had assumed that the wind was blowing to me at my back. Then I saw a navy blue saucer hovering above some trees. Then the sun had risen from behind me, with great luck. So I was able to make out the red horizontal stripes across the top and bottom of it.It is hard to describe because it was lingring in the clouds-just stationary. It appeared to not be there-as the air around it was swirrled and possibly manipulated.There we're ports tham seem to make clapping noises as they emit VERY small and dense strings (beams) of tiny white flares that seem to move upon an undifined line, into the sky, at different intervals directly above it. From the moment I saw it from the moment it had left, did I ever make the judgement that it was an aircraft of human nature.While this occourance was happening I was going to go get my camera, but just as that thought entered my head it just floated upward, untill I couldon't see it anymore.;29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178
