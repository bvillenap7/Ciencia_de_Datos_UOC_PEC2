LARGE OBLONG CIGAR SHAPED WINGLESS BRIGHT OBJECT MOVING EAST TO WEST OVER HOUSTON TEXAS;2001-01-05 18:40:00;15 MIN;LARGE OBLONG CIGAR SHAPED WINGLESS BRIGHT OBJECT MOVING EAST TO WEST OVER HOUSTON TEXAS AT ABOUT 5:40 PM /CT BAYTOWN, TEXAS, I WAS DRIVING MY CAR TO PICK UP MY GRANDDAUGHTER AT THE LIBRARY IN  THE LATE EVENING AS THE  SUN WAS JUST SETTING  BELOW  THE HORIZON.  THE SKY WAS STILL BLUE WITH A HIGH CLOUD OR TWO REFLECTING ORANGE   COLOR ON THE CLOUDS.    I OBSERVED A BRIGHT OBLONG  OBJECT MOVING FROM EAST TO WEST.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A METEORITE WITH A TAIL ON IT MOVING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE.      I  PULLED MY CAR INTO A PARKING LOT TO WATCH IT FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES OR SO. THE OBJECT WAS MOVING ABOUT THE SPEED OF AN AIRPLANE. AS I WATCHED IT, THERE WERE OTHER AIRPLANES MOVING AROUND WITH LANDING LIGHTS ON AND I COMPARED THE OBJECT TO THE AIRPLANES.  THE AIRPLANES LOOKED DARK EVEN WITH THEIR LANDING LIGHTS ON AGAINST THE BLUE SKY.   I SAW NO WINGS ON THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE FLYING MUCH HIGHER THAN THE AIRPLANES AND WAS TOTALLY COVERED WITH A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT,  NOTHING LIKE THE AIRPLANES I OBSERVED.    THE OBJECT MOVED COMPLETELY ACROSS THE SKY IN ABOUT 7 OR 8 MINUTES, FROM OVER BAYTOWN TO HOUSTON, AND THEN SEEMED TO SLOW DOWN OR STOP AND THEN START MOVING AGAIN.  THE OBJECT FLYING AS HIGH AS IT WAS,  SEEMED TWICE AS LARGE COMPARED TO THE AIRPLANES FLYING AT A LOWER ALTITUDE.     IT ALSO SEEMED TO ME THAT THE SUN MIGHT HAVE BEEN REFLECTING ON THE OBJECT BECAUSE THE OBJECT MAINTAINED IT'S BRIGHTNESS WITH A SLIGHT ORANGE COLOR THE ENTIRE TIME I OBSERVED IT. THE OBJECT DID NOT LEAVE ANY VAPOR TRAIL LIKE A HIGH FLYING PLANE MIGHT DO.    THE OBJECT FLEW INTO A SMALL ORANGE CLOUD AND EMERGED A MINUTE LATER AND THEN SEEMED TO CHANGE DIRECTION TO THE SOUTH.    I LIVE ABOUT 30 MILES EAST OF HOUSTON AND THIS OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER HOUSTON TEXAS THE LAST TIME I OBSERVED IT. THE OBJECT STOOD OUT BECAUSE OF IT'S BRIGHTNESS.     I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WAS AN AIRPLANE AFTER  COMPARING THE PLANES TO IT.   IT LOOKED ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THE PLANES.  I HAD TO STOP WATCHING IT BECAUSE I HAD TO PICK UP MY GRANDDAUGHTER FROM THE LIBRARY AT 6:00 PM.;29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178
Silvery glowing cigar shaped object moving very fast then dissapearing.;2003-04-10 02:00:00;30 sec;Silvery glowing cigar shaped object moving very fast then dissapearing. At 2:00Am at the Houston Raceway Park    I got up to visit the porta-potty.  Out of the sky NNW of me I saw what I first thought was a falling star moving to my right and toward the land to my right.  But this was shaped like a silver cigar case that was glowing white and there was no downward arc.  Then it turned towards Louisiana.  It went straight away from me to the east. Then it made an abrupt right turn out to the Louisiana coast and then back to its previous line away from me to the east.  Then it dissapeared. It did not fade away it dissapeared.  My estimate of altitude and duration lead me to believe it travelled at 8000 miles per hour.;29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178
