21 Orange Orbs over Baytown.;2013-07-18 21:00:00;5 minutes;21 Orange Orbs over Baytown OK, so I donâ€™t know what to make of this. I am not someone who believes in aliens or flying saucers, but something is very strange here. About 9pm tonight (July 18th, 2013), I was sitting in my garage having a long distance phone conversation with my mother  and seen a group of 21 orange lights floating from W to E (or from right to left in front of our house) across the sky.  It was like a randomly placed formation of orange orbs/fireballs.   I ran to get my iPhone to get a pic, it only got 3 of them as the streetlight was blinding the shot. By the time I got back outside, most of them had disappeared.   There were about 7 left when I came out with my phone, but each slowly vanished into the clouds, at the same point in the clouds.;29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178
