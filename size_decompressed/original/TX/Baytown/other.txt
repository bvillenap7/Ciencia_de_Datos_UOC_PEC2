It was shaped like a squared off boomerange or an L with the short side slanted up slightly. It had six round white lights on one side and four on the other. It was silent moving over the hospital I was at waiting for my daughter to deliver her first child. I backed up watching it as much as possible ruling out everything I could think of that flew around that area. Nothing matched. I looked down for maybe 3 seconds and when I looked up it was gone. I don't know if it was a ufo but it was something. It was so black that if you weren't really watching the sky you would have missed it. It was large enough that if it sat down on top of the hospital (San Jacinto hospital) it would be much too large.;29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178
off v shaped, non-reflective, huge in size, did not make any sounds;2003-10-31 02:00:00;10 to 15 minutes;off v shaped, non-reflective, huge in size, did not make any sounds I had gone out to smoke a cigarette on the second floor patio at the San Jacinto hospital waiting for my grandchild to be born. I came out the door, lit up and looked at the sky with a lot of stars out. I noticed a large blank spot amongst the stars and noticed the blankness was moving at a very slow pace. It was in the shape of an off V shape. It was an non reflective deep black. If someone was to just glance up would not notice it. It had six round white lights on the long side and four on the other side. I would say an estimation of size to be at least 20 blocks from wing tip to wing tip if that was what it was. It made no sound and seemed to just glide moothly through the air. It was about 200 feet about me. I watched and kept backing up to watch it. It passed over until the higher side of the hospital blocked my view. so I stepped to the other side of the patio to see where it went but it was like it vanished.;29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178
vertical and horizontal flares moving slowly in the sky  ((NUFORC Note:  Both photos are of contrails against a clear sky.  PD));2005-01-16 17:48:00;5 min. ?;vertical and horizontal flares moving slowly in the sky I saw a bright vertical streak of light high in the sky. When I went out into the backyard to get a better look I noticed there was another one but it was perfectly horizontal. As the horizontal one moved slowly to the left (south), the vertical one descended slowly toward the treetops until they both faded away. The horizontal one was probably 3 times as long as the vertical one. There may be a perfectly good explanation for this but I sure don't know what it is. I read that iridium flares only last for a few seconds, and this lasted for about 5 minutes so I ruled that out. If you have any ideas I would really appreciate an explanation. I did get a couple of pictures of the vertical one. I am sending them to you. Thanks! ((NUFORC Note:  Both photos are of contrails against a clear sky.  PD));29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178
Strange sparkling somewhere near Baytown, Texas;2013-08-04 00:30:00;30 seconds;Strange sparkling somewhere near Baytown, Texas The wife and I were heading home from Delta Downs Casino...we decided to get on Toll Road 99 Grand Parkway...this road is very lonely...our home is located at Seabrook, Texas... As we were somewhere I the middle of this Toll Road...I turned to tell the wife that there may be a good chance of having a UFO encounter... No sooner had I said this to her I turned back toward the ahead of me...when suddenly the wife and I saw sparkling lights...at first I thought them to be flashing...the colors were Red, White, and Blue... The distance from my car, about a half a mile...the toll was straight from where the and my car... Within a seconds of seeing this I was impressed to slow down and before long I came to a complete stop...as I was slowing down, I turned to ask my wife if she was scared... She didn't have to say anything, she was terrified and speechless...as I again turned to see the road ahead of me I was impress to accelerate...as I started to gain speed, I again focus as to the last time I saw these lights...and to our disappointment, they were not there anymore... Well, get this...about two weeks before this...the wife and I were on Hwy 146...about two miles from the Toll Bridge...we were talking about things in general when suddenly we notice a flashing sign on the side of this Highway...it said road close ahead...seconds later, I saw what I thought to be sparling lights...thinking they were squad cars re-directing traffic...these lights appeared to be too high about a squad car, but nevertheless that what I was thinking...though I did not see any squad cars...we were about a half a mile from these lights... As I was driving along, I noticed something...I was now going on a very different direction...I was on 330 off-ramp...I did not make this maneuver...I even question my wife as to where am I... To make this story short...I arrived home about 30 plus minutes later... Thanks for reading this...Sincerely...;29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178

Appeared to be from a very large fire.   I was driving down 7th street toward ward road to locate the source of such large flashing cloud, but as I drove it moved away from me until finally disappearing, totally out of sight by the store on Beaumont street bit leaving behind a smoke trail in the sky.  I told my husband to check to see if there was any fires in the area and there were none.;29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178
