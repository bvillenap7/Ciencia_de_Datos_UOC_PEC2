As I was shutting my windows to go to sleep, I saw a light.  It wasn’t all that bright.  I immediately opened my window again and saw it moving closer.  It was an arrowhead shape and it had three lights moving away from me.  I called my mom, who was spending the night, and she ran in and saw it as it rushed by our water tower or what it seemed like.;29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178
