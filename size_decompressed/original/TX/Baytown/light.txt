Single light moving very fast, zig-sagged, stopped, vanished in 2-3 seconds;2011-10-21 19:40:00;2 seconds;Single light moving very fast, zig-sagged, stopped, vanished in 2-3 seconds At exactly 7:40 pm cdt I looked up in the sky because something moving very fast caught my eye.  It looked like a regular star, a single white light, moving about 20 times faster than a jet airplane.  In an instant it zigzagged/ (wobbled??) about 5-10 times, stopped, and shot straight up into space without making a sound.  I asked a guy who I know and was 2-3 feet from me if he saw it.  He had not. The sky was clear, perfect weather, and this was in the north-north east sky. I have never seen anything like this.  Shooting stars don't zig zag as far as I know because I've seen them. I'm a man in his early fifties, don't drink, doe drugs, or anything that would have distorted my perception. This entire incident lasted about 2-3 seconds at the longest n;29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178
Red Orange that glowed moving and stopping with my movements.;2011-10-28 19:00:00;10 secs;Red Orange that glowed moving and stopping with my movements. I was talking on the phone to my cousin and I saw an orange?red light off to my right up in the night sky. It was about the size of a pea to the naked eye and it was traveling in a semi straight pattern.  The colour change was going back and forth between Orangered to Red to Orange to just red. It glowed. There was not a distinction in colour like with lights changing, it just was.  As i watched it fly across the sky at speed that varied, I started to walk out into the yard to get a better look,  When i started walking to it, it stopped and hung in the air.  I stopped, then it started to move at a different speed. I moved, it stopped. As i was describing it to my cousin on the phone i watched the light decrease in size, the speed was not changing, from a Pea size down to pin point, then a bit of a white halo around the orb, all of a sudden it was just gone.  No speed increase no movement, just not there. I decided to google what i saw tonight and found this site,! Thought i would put what i saw into words. It was neat!;29.7653223744292;-94.9303808219178
