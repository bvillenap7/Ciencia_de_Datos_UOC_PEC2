bright light moving slow.;1999-06-14 21:30:00;2 min.;bright light moving slow. my wife and i were walking south on the beach and noticed a moving point of light in SW night sky. it moved from the SW to NE.kind of slow but no blinking lights like an airplane. occasionaly the object would slow down an then speed up but nothing drastic. when the light got directly overhead it got significantly brighter. this forced us to look closer. a plane went by at several thousand feet and its lights were easily recognized. we thought it might be a satellite but it moved in an irregular manner and seemed to be moving to slow. i guess it's still a possibility that it was sputnik or something. after 2 minutes or so the object disappeared in NE sky without any incident.;27.7679;-97.1001
Blue Light Streaks Accross the South Texas Sky;2004-06-27 04:15:00;4 seconds;Blue Light Streaks Accross the South Texas Sky Saw what appeared to be a bright blue (almost neon) streaking across the sky while fishing in the early morning hours. My son saw it first and called it to my attention. I would have noticed the after effect as it appeared to go behind a lone cloud and explode. The night sky lit up to the point the ground was fairly lit up. Did not hear any sound and it was not lightning. Very interesting.;27.7679;-97.1001
