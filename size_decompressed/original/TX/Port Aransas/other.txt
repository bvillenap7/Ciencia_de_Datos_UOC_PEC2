There was a great many number of lashing lights. Shortly followed by a loud rumbling. The ground shook and some trees bent down to the ground. Theyare still like that today. There was no wind at all during the 3 or 4 minutes I saw the 3 crafts. The lights that were flashing were bright white and rainbow colors. The other two people who were there were also astonished. We couldn't believe our eyes. There should seriously be some sincere investigation into this this was crazy. Also at the base of the three crafts they had large circular looking doors i can only asume that was what they were. Also all of the street lights turned out and there seemed to be no electricity in the area.

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
