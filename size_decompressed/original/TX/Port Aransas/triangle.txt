Casa Grande, Az;1987-08-20 02:00:00;3 minutes;Casa Grande Az I did see a giant V (triangle) shaped craft in the sky on a very dark clear night sky in Arizona by Casa Grande while we were driving on the highway between Tucson and Phoenix I believe. My boyfriend was driving.  I was enjoying the stars in the sky by hanging my head out of the window looking upwards (imagine a dog) with its head out the window, that was me.  I was marveling at the millions of stars that were up there and being from Illinois with the light pollution, I had never seen so many stars in a dark night sky before. I was amazed!!  So we are headed down the highway with no other cars, pretty solitary road that late, past midnight. I am looking up out of the passenger window and the largest V-shape came into view.  It blocked out the stars in its shape.  It had no lights at the time and never shone any at all.  We drove under it and all the time I was staring up at in an awestruck/dumbstruck frame of mind.  We were going about 55 mph and drove under it for a few minutes! (It was that BIG!!)  It was so close and so silent that if you never looked up you would have never known it was there. It was like you could have stood on top of the car and thrown a rock at it and hit it, that is how close it was. Not a sound from it at all.  I kept my mouth shut and never told my boyfriend to pull over and look at this.  I was just wondering what the heck I was seeing and never felt any fear just wonderment. We kept driving along and I kept my head out the window looking up watching it above us and I can just plainly say it was shocking.  Years later I wonder why I never said anything about it to anyone. So here it finally is. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));27.7679;-97.1001
