We heard the dogs barking outside so I sent my husband out to check, and on his way back inside he seen something out of the corner of his eye, three lights that seemed to glow orange and red in the perfect shape of a triangle.   They never disappeared nor did they change shape, the color seemed to fade to a light blue at one point, not sure if it was our eyes playing tricks on us or not.   We watched until 22:40. We do have a picture, sorry no video recorder handy.;29.0905;-97.2815
