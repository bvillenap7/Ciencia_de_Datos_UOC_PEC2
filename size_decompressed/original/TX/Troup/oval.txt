Looked in the direction South East and saw a VERY bright Red light ascending out of the woods....or it seemed to be. The object then stopped in mid air..I'mn guesing 20 or 30 feet out of the tree tops. It then changed colors rapidly from red to green to white and the back to red. Moved towards my direction covering approximately 10 miles in a few seconds. Once the object got closer to me I saw four lights on the object in the pattern Red Green Green Red...and a white light at the end...pulsating brightly. This object passed no more than 400 feet over me...and made absolutley NO noise....I have a 2 million power Q-beam I shined on it....and it looked like the motor cycle from the 80's movie Tron....that's the best way I can describe it. It continued moving in a North Westerdly direction till out of sight. I am a military veteran and have seen almost all of the known air craft the military has in its arsenal. This object loooked like nothing I have ever seen while I was in service. I did notoce after the object passed over that I was slightly disoriented and a little dizzy.;32.1142;-95.1142
