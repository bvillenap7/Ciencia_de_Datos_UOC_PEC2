Thought it was the moon, but no moon in the sky.;2009-03-16 06:15:00;less then a minute;Thought it was the moon, but no moon in the sky. I was sleeping and awoke to the moon glaring through my window.  I wear contacts and did not have them in while I was sleeping so I was looking up at the moon slightly blurred due to not having my contacts in.  I decided to get up even though it was still an hour or so before I was due to wake.  I went outside to smoke a cigarette and looked up, no moon.  The sky was relatively clear and there was no moon.  I know it was shining on my face and illuminated the bedding around me but there was nothing in the sky.;30.6826;-94.8988
Twinkling multi-colored object stationary in night sky over east Texas;2010-10-05 21:30:00;hours;Twinkling multi-colored object stationary in night sky over east Texas On 10/4/2010 at approximately 9:00 pm, a multi-color object was seen 30-35 degrees above the horizon in the western sky.  The object appeared slightly larger than a star and seemed to twinkle.  With the naked eye some color variations could be seen.  When viewed with binoculars, the object cycled through a pattern of colored lights â€“ red-green-blue, red-green-blue.  The object appears stationary in the sky for longer than an hour.

Very brightly lit thing in the sky that eventually dimmed and moved out of sight extremely slow.;2012-04-17 22:24:00;7 minutes;Very brightly lit thing in the sky that eventually dimmed and moved out of sight extremely slow. I went outside and got this urge to look up at the sky and I saw this insanely bright star. I've never seen a star that bright before. I couldn't stop looking at it.  But then I realized that this might be a UFO or something not normal, so I looked at my cell phone to see what time it was. It was 2224 and I kept looking at the light and realized it was getting dimmer.  I noticed that 3 minutes had gone by. As I kept staring at it...it very slowly moved out of sight.  I don't know if this was a star or something astronomical or if it was a UFO.;30.6826;-94.8988
Bright lit  clouds on pitch dark night.;2012-12-28 19:00:00;10 minutes;Bright lit  clouds on pitch dark night. On my way home from shopping.. it was pitch black - and although there was a nearly full moon, what I saw was uncommon for our area. surrounding the moon for 1/4 mile left to right were luminescent clouds- like something was shinning a flash light only it was horizontal and about 1/4 mile wide.  I watched the lit up clouds for a distance and then took my eyes away to turn in the drive and when I looked back, the light was gone. The clouds look like they were lit up from behind. the moon was clearly visible as it was just above the clouds and it was not shinning through them.  As I said, it was pitch black else where in the sky, and when the light went out it was dark again.  There was no light coming from the ground like  a search light, it was strictly in the sky.

This didn't have a tail or drag along across the sky as if it was falling...  This flew in a straight direction and disappeared before my eyes.  It was slow and fast at the same time.  There was no sound I know this because I didn't have my radio on. I live in the country in a small town and 190 is completely dark specifically in the area I was driving in while this incident happened.  I wanted to report this because I know what I seen this morning.  I hope someone else seen it to so I don't feel like a nut.  It almost seem like it want me to see it;30.6826;-94.8988

However the light pulsed very brightly and would then go out for a second or so and then become bright again.  Everytime the light came back on it had moved a significant distance.  This went on for about 3 minutes until the light traveled so far that it was no longer visible.  We then found the Envisat satellite and noted how slow it moved in comparison the pulsing light.;30.6826;-94.8988
