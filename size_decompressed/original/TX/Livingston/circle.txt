Bright, circular white light moving over East Texas was easily seen with full moon out.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite.  PD));2007-07-01 22:40:00;1 min;Bright, circular white light moving over East Texas was easily seen with full moon out My daughter & I had gone out to see the full moon on 07/01/07 around 10:30 pm. We both saw it at the same time.  It was like someone had turned a light switch on. It was a white circular light & as bright as the North Star.  It wasn’t a plane because all the planes that we see are coming from the south & going north.  This was in the eastern sky on the left side of the full moon & it was moving horizontally & going south.  As it moved the light dimmed until there was no light at all.  It took approximately 30-60 seconds. We’ve seen lots of fallen stars & it wasn’t that either.  This did not leave a trail, it just disappeared.
