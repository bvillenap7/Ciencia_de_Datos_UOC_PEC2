We saw 3 objects in the sky.;2013-11-19 22:00:00;30 minutes;We saw 3 objects in the sky. Multi colored lights appeared over my pasture toward Livingston State Park. The first one was over the trees with 5 lights vertically aligned.  The lights were red and yellow.  While watching this object a second, smaller version appeared behind the first one.  I noticed another small object beginning to descend over my pasture, within 30 yards of my home.  I approached and tried to take a picture but it would not appear in the view finder.  The lights would not show.  I could hear a sound like a child's toy helicopter.  There was no actual helicopter chopping air sound just a steady whirring.  The object descended very slowly but I couldn't make out the object due to the darkness.  It appeared in the dark to resemble the shape of a dragonfly. It was so close that I became fearful trying to take a picture.  The object then lifted straight up and disappeared into the darkness after going south from my home.  I then turned my attention back to the large object! which had descended partially behind the tree line.  My boyfriend said he thought it was a cell tower, however I explained that we would have noticed it by now since we are outside every evening. As we were discussing what it could be it disappeared with us looking directly at it.  The other smaller object then proceeded to float from south to north and back again before also disappearing.  This entire event lasted approximately 30 minutes.;30.6826;-94.8988
