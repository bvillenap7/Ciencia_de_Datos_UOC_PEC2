Mothership and three saucers left behind;1979-04-15 03:00:00;30min;Mothership and three saucers left behind This happenened in 1979, I do not recall the month, it was 3:00 am spring i think.  My husband had the alarm for that time to get ready for work, no telling how long it was out there.  We saw how bright the moon was, we layed there for a couple of minutes all of a sudden it moved in a certain pattern, we watched for about fifteen minutes, he said he had to go to work, so I watched, then, three objects came out of the left top and flew down , then the big moon object moved the same pattern as the first time and it left like a blink of eye. It stayed up there a long time in between all this. there is a lot more to this, so much happened at the time and after I strongly feel like more happened, I can't believe that no one has reported this as I have checked alot of stories in that time and nowhere is this mentioned I can't for the world think we were the only ones that seen this event!  This has bothered me for a long time, I am 59 now and I feel some one out there knows something  a black helicopter was our residence and I knew they knew and it worried us then. If you know anything PLEASE let me know, it will bring me some kind of relief. Thank you for your time and excuse my typing my grand daughter is teaching me how to use this computor. I heard Peter Davenport on coast ot coast and figured it was my last chance to talk to someone about this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));31.9592;-95.2673
