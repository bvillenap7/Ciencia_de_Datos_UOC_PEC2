A friend and I were outside after a party saying goodbye's and we both noticed a large blue circular shape above us in the clearing of the trees over our house. It was so still I recall noticing how bright the light was but didn't bother looking up because I thought it was just the moon. Once I glanced up and noticed it was blue and not the moon, it immediately jetted to the east at an extremely high rate of speed - from where we were standing it was like twenty feet and it was then behind the tops of our trees - then it stayed there but the light dimmed and made wiggly trails and disappeared. My friend and I started freaking out about it. It was unusual because it hovered above in the clearing almost like it had been watching us, once we looked up and noticed it, it took off. Never seen anything like it in my life. This was not a plane or helicopter or firework - it was in the air totally not moving or making noise for a good minute before it shot off to the right (east). We were facing north. It was like it was watching us. Big blue glowing sphere shape. Then it disappeard.;29.3796;-98.2643
