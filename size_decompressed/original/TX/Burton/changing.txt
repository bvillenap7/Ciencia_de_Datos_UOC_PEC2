A few minutes later, I changed location, to see get an unobstructed view of the horizon spanning from Washington county to Harris County.  In the direction ofHouston, I witnessed a disc-shaped craft hovering, flashing red, white, and blue like a disco ball.  I grabbed a pair of binoculars, put them on a solid  surface, and sat down to watch this thing.  Every once in a while, I caught a few random white sparks appear anywhere within its radius for a split second. Like sparkles.  It’s still there 03:46 and getting closer.  I am pretty certain I watched it change from a horizontal to a vertical shape for a moment then return to disc-like.  It’s really close now.  Coming towards Burton.  03:49.;30.179;-96.595
