I was outside star-gazing and I heard what sounded like the central air unit had kicked on (I have no central air in my house) and I looked outside and saw multiple faint, glowing lights and the lights came together and became one single searchlight and the light started to move in a circular pattern as if searching for something.   Afterwards, the light and the sound disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));30.179;-96.595
