Brilliant white sparkling light, like a 100,000 sparkler-sticks, appearing suddenly and moving silently across the sky above trees.;1984-06-30 21:00:00;10-15 seconds;Brilliant white sparkling light, like a 100,000 sparkler-sticks, appearing suddenly and moving silently across the sky above trees. It was a summer's night and I'd recently had an intense religious experience.  I had become a Christian in the traditional sense of accepting Jesus/God into my soul/heart.   I was outdoors praying very, very intensely.  The most intensely I've ever prayed.  Suddenly I heard a voice in my head say to look around behind me.  I turned and saw a large white brilliant light that was sparkling like a 100,000 glitter-sticks.  It was slowly moving, soundlessly, across the sky, above the tree-tops, and above my parent's house.  It was silent.   It suddenly just dissappeared. No noise, no smoke, nothing.  I did not see or hear anything after the incident.  It scared me.   I walked quickly into the house.  I felt at the time that I'd experienced a close encounter with an alien of some sort.  I was truly afraid.   I walked into my parent's house, went immediately to my mother's desk, and wrote a poem about titled, 'The Light.'  I told others what I'd seen.  Some were interested, some not, but the Youth Director at my church took the poem and sent it to some publishers.  I did not know he'd done this until he approached me one day and said that he'd done so and had two offers to print the poem.   I was paid money for my permission.  One magazine printed the poem and illustrated a young man looking up into the sky at a brilliant light.   Something of interest is that before I this incident, I'd seen what looked like a very unusual shooting star, several times.  Each time I saw it, it seemed to be closer and closer to me.  It was quite unusual and got my attention.   I've not seen the light again, but have seen other things, including an angel, or at least what I perceived as one.   I am a mature adult, a medical professional, and I would have absolutely no reason to lie or joke about this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in the summer of 1984 is approximate.

Off to my l;2004-02-22 01:20:00;2 minutes;I was returning from doing some star gazing with a new spotter scope I have. I was traveling on Hwy 380 traffic was light. Off to my left, south toward where Lake Dallas is at I noticed a round brite light slowly rising. This area is also has and is used for landing traffic at DFW airport. At first I figured it was just a helicopter no biggy then this light or whatever shot from my left across to my right in mere seconds and nothing travels that fast. I stopped on the shoulder and grabbed some bincluars to see if I could get a better look. It stopped and hovered off in the distance for a few seconds the zoomed away at a forty to forty five degree angle north and was gone with in three seconds. Distance I first saw it was five to seven mile away crossed in front of me two the three miles ahead and again stopped I would say ten miles north then zoom off The area is all rural trees and pasture land. I know military aircraft and this was not one of them I would stay the altitude was 1000 to 1500 feet A few moments later I crossed the Trinty river which empties into lake Dallas and wonder if this was where it had crossed. Now north is another lake, Lake Roberts. Wish I could be more helpful, but it happen so fast!;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
Unseen Lights In The Sky;2004-12-07 16:30:00;unknown;Unseen Lights In The Sky I had my digital camera less than a week when I decided to take a picture of the multi-layered sky as a storm front was tracking into the are where I live. The storm was tracking nearly straight west to east and I was looking south down the line of the approaching storm. I only took one picture at that time and didn't see anything unusual flying in the sky. It took me a few days to even review the pic on my camera before I noticed something odd. It took me a couple of more days to get my camera's photo software installed on my computer, download the picture, and import it into Paint Shop Pro. The orginal picture shows two unusual lights in the sky, one dim one in the upper left and the obvious one in the upper right. All I've done in Paint Shop Pro is to brighten the image, do a couple of zooms on the lights, and create a negative image of the light on the right side. The zoomed light on the right appears to me to have a energetic field around it, and the negative of it makes this look even more apparent. If these are actual objects, they would have to have been shooting upward into the dark storm clouds so fast that I never saw them. I've seen my share of air traffic in the area, but with that storm rolling in, there wasn't a plane in the sky. Other than fighter jets, I've never seen any aircraft flying upward at such steep angles, and never into a storm! I'm also certain there were no sounds of any jets in the area at that time either.;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
Bright, wobbling, white light moving accross the sky, no sound and moving fast compare to other airplanes and satellites.;2009-09-27 20:08:00;2 minutes;Bright, wobbling, white light moving accross the sky, no sound and moving fast compare to other airplanes and satellites. I was with a friend when we noticed a bright white light moving across the sky.  It was 5 times larger than the biggest star in the sky at the time and twice as bright.  It at first appeard to be an airplane since an airport is nearby and other aircraft were simultaneously visible, however as it went overhead there was no noise and we noticed a wobbling effect every couple seconds.  I should also mention that these aircraft were likely commercial or private and weren't pursuing this object.  There were also a couple satellites tracking across the sky high up in the background moving in varying directions, they were MUCH smaller and appeared to be moving MUCH slower than the object in question. This light headed SE from NW and would suddendly wobble left and right, in a predictably rhythmic fashion every couple seconds or so.  It wasn't changing course, instead, it appeared to rattle and continue straight... then over again, similar to wathing the line on a heartbeat monitor.  It eventually faded out of view. I've seen this object once before around the same time of evening on what appeared to be an identicle track, size, and brightness however there was no wobbling on the first occasion.  I chalked the first sighting up as maybe a VERY LOW flying satellite if a type I've never seen. My best guess for this most recent sighting is perhaps a weather balloon caught up in a large airmass with some resonant turbulance.  Who knows????

Bright light falls to ground, changes directions several times, then descends to earth.;2009-11-12 23:15:00;10 mins.;Bright light falls to ground, changes directions several times, then descends to earth. I was going home from work at about 11:15pm. I work in Fort Worth, but live in Denton and I was traveling on I-35W heading north. As I was reaching the Ponder area I noticed what looked like a bright falling star go directly straight for the earth in the north (straight ahead). I thought it was a falling star until I saw the light go out and then immediately come back on, but it was stationary. Then I watched as it flew (about as fast as a jet) straight west, then turn straight east. As this was happening, it would sporadically get dimmer, then really bright (brighter than a typical star). I watched it turn west once more, then it hovered in one spot, just west of I-35. Then I saw it slowly go down and, I assume, land. It was bright as it landed, and I could see the trees around it as it descended. What amazed me was it's ease of turning directions, without slowing down.;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
Five glowing fiery lights seen looking north from U. of North Texas campus before slowly vanishing.;2012-12-06 18:47:00;10-15 seconds;Five glowing fiery lights seen looking north from U. of North Texas campus before slowly vanishing. I was walking on the campus of the University of North Texas, and as I made the corner around a building and turned due north, I saw 5 glowing, fiery, orange lights in the sky.  I don't know how far away they were or how high they were as I couldn't make out exactly what they were and therefore couldn't judge depth at all, but the angle between me and where the objects were was under 45 degrees, probably around 30 degrees.  To clarify, I was looking at the objects through telephone wires that were across the street from me, probably 30-50 feet away. I instinctively took out my phone to record a video, but unfortunately the video shows absolutely nothing.  I stopped filming after 9 seconds of video because I realized that it wasn't working properly, and as I did so the lights had already started fading.  The entire ordeal lasted probably about 15 seconds, and within 2-3 seconds after I stopped filming, all of the lights had entirely disappeared. So to quickly summarize without unnecessary detail, there were 5 orange, fiery, glowing lights slowly moving in the sky. They were due north of the UNT campus and were drifting downwards in the sky, so I'm assuming they were moving north (or falling, I guess). Some were brighter than others, but all 5 were much, much brighter than any star. Their formation didn't necessarily look organized, but it didn't exactly look scattered either, and their movements were virtually uniform. Over the course of 15 seconds, the lights faded and ceased one by one. There is a lot of light pollution on campus, and that is why this was so startling to me at first. You could probably count the number of stars you could see from where I was on two hands because of the light pollution. If you were to look at the UNT campus map, I was walking between the Auditorium Building and Hickory Hall towards W Hickory Street, and was probably 10-15 feet in front of the Auditorium Building when I saw the UFO.  Hickory is a busy street but there was absolutely nothing that could have caused what I saw from the streets, nor from anywhere else in my surrounding environment. The only logical explanations I could come up with, outside of extraterrestrial-related things of course, are that it could have been a flare gun that I caught right as it was dissipating (which, to be frank, I do not know if that is actually a feasible explanation or not based on what I saw because I have no experience with flare guns), or that it could have been the remnants of a broken up meteorite that were burning up slowly in the atmosphere, but my issue with that theory is that they were seemingly way too bright to be that, however again, I do not know the exact details of how that looks so I can't be sure. Ultimately, I have no explanation at the moment for what I saw. And that is both amazing and frightening.;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
Ball of greenish blue light in the sky.;2014-05-22 03:30:00;8 seconds;Ball of greenish blue light in the sky. Around 0330 in the morning I caught a glimpse out of the corner of my eye in the eastern sky.  I had my patio door open at the time.   I walked out immediately and saw an intense ball of light moving from west to east in the sky. It was green/bluish in color so bright I could see the light on the clouds around it.  It was moving fast but not as fast as a shooting star.  It was still incredibly fast and fluid in motion.  After watching for it a few seconds I saw a flash of red and it disappeared.  It had no sound. I'm a United States Marine and have seen plenty of aircraft and satellites and what I saw was none of those things.  It took a moment to register in my brain.;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
Very fasy orange orb zipping around the sky around a lightning storm.;2016-07-05 00:29:00;15 minutes;Very fasy orange orb zipping around the sky around a lightning storm. I was on the balcony with my girlfriend watching the crazy lightning in the sky, when a mysterious orb showed up out of no where.  I was extremely terrified at the sheer speed it had to be moving.  The crazy flight patterns blew me away as I have never seen something that agile in my life.  The orb seemed to be trying to hid within the stormy night.   My girlfriend and I are both college students and we were near a local university at the time.  With multiple videos and a few pictures from two different sources the mysterious orange orb I saw tonight will, in no doubt in my mind be one of the most compelling cases.  Right after my sighting, I called the UFO hotline and the man I spoke with said many similar sights happened all over tonight.  I already believed we are not alone im just so glad to finally catch one on film. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the date above, and asked the witness for confirmation.

Alien Spacecraft?Idk it was beautiful Nobody will believe me, i’ve been seeing double digit numbers all the time like, 11:33, 4:44, 2:22 etc. I thought it was my guardian angels until I kept waking up with marks on my body. I had the roman number 6 (VI) scratches next to my eye on my cheek bone. I had the number 11 scratched on my leg. So I did research and other abducties have had similar experiences. I try telling people this because i’m so confused and I want people to hear me out but they think i’m crazy. My and my best friend had previously saw a glowing orb in the sky that disappeared in seconds on September 25th around 8pm. Me and my coworker saw what we thought was a shooting star on September 27th. But here’s the story i’m deciding to report which happened tonight October 1st, 2019 around 9pm.  So one night I was working as a pizza delivery guy, and as I was trying to find the customers apartment, I kept seeing double digits and I felt like I was being watched, so I just got really angr! y and fed up and I was like “IF IM BEING HAUNTED BY DEMONS OR ALIENS, SHOW YOURSELF SO I CAN KNOW WHATS GOING ON” and two seconds later my intuition told me to look up at the sky and, A orb of bright light was hovering perfectly still above the clouds, as if it were watching me and as I reach for my phone to try and record it, it zipped away at a speed I can’t even comprehend.. and then later reappeared out of thin air. It was beautiful but terrifying. It moved SO fast my soul was stunned. What is it? Craft? Or Interdimensional beings? Gods? Us from the future? I’m not sure what’s going on but should I be worried that the second I asked “Them” to show themselves, I see a UFO watching me literally right after??? If they get me what do I do? This is a global emergency, what are they and why are they here? I intend on finding the truth.;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
