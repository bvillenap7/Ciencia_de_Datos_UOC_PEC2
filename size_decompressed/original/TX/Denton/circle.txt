The north Texas night sky was dark and clear, the moon to the SW direction of the object.  The light was a similiar to the color of an bright white LED, but larger and brighter than I have ever seen.  Positively NOT from a commercial aircraft.;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
Denton TX Green ball shaped object moving upward at a fast rate;2007-05-22 23:00:00;3-4 seconds;Denton TX Green ball shaped object moving upward at a fast rate Sitting out side having a cig. Looked like a storm coming in so I was lookin up at the sky.  I seen a ball shaped light green object with what seemed to be a black circle (ora) around it moving straight up. It Moved pretty fast not so fast that I couldnt follow it with my eyes and try to make it out but fast enough where I lost it after a few second in the clouds. Lets put it this way In the 21 years that I have been a live I havent seen anything move nearly that quick and that smooth. Also it was fairly close and it didnt make a sound. Seen on 5/22/07;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
Three white circle objects dissapear over 35W;2007-11-21 10:00:00;1 minute;Three white circle objects dissapear over 35W I think I saw a UFO. I am not really sure. I feel like I am kind of crazy for thinking this. I was driving on 35W in Denton, TX around 10:15 a.m. 11/21/07 this morning and when I came over a hill I saw three white things in the sky.  It was like 1 mile in front of me, slightly to the right. I wasn't sure if it was the balls that are on powerline to warn airplanes and then I thought it was a reflection the stadium. the balls were white with some silver tint. They were almost a perfect circle, but a little oblong. They were perfectly aligned in a row a little to the left of me looking straight ahead. I was thinking I should take a picture because I thought oh it might be a UFO. I was trying to figure out what it was and the one on the right disapeared and one second later the middle one dissapeared and a little less then one second later the left one dissapeared. It didn't fade out or dart away. It just dissapeared in a split second. I am super freaked out right now and I don't know if It was something from Carswell air base or Lockead Martin, but I have NEVER seen anything like this before. It was soooo clear too. Not fuzy at all! PLease let me know if anyone else has seen this one in Denton! I have been very skeptical of UFO sightings, but I am so freaked out and paranoid now!;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
I initially heard a whhoosh sound for quite awhile without witnessing anything.;2010-10-27 03:00:00;2:00;I initially heard a whhoosh sound for quite awhile without witnessing anything. I was on my apt. back porch talking to my my mom and I kept hearing some kind of whooshing sound.  After I got off the phone I went out my front door of my apt complex to see what it was and I saw a light in the sky the was stationary.   I saw someone walking thru the the parking lot and asked him to look up and he saw it.  Then it made a whooshing sound and he heard it.  I went in to call the police and then I went back out and the guy had left. The policeman came and saw it but never heard the sound. FtWorth TX is nearby and I tried calling them but to no avail as I thought they may have known about it.  Please let me know what you find!

Circular orange light fell from sky then disappeared.;2013-01-06 21:00:00;10 seconds;Circular orange light fell from sky then disappeared. A friend and I were driving to get ice cream on highway 380, we had just passed TWU and were headed to Sonic right before you get to Loop 288.  We saw a light that looked orange and was circular shape make an arch as it flew slowly across the sky.  As it descended it looked like it was falling then abruptly it disappeared. It was strange and was definitely not a shooting star or a meteor because there was no tail.  After we got our ice cream we noticed five helicopters in the Denton area from various points across the sky.;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
Two white circular lights (orbs) hovering near the roof top four houses away from my next-door neighbor's backyard.;2016-06-23 22:16:00;5-6 minutes;Two white circular lights (orbs) hovering near the roof top four houses away from my next-door neighbor's backyard. This photo was taken by me at 10:16 p.m., June 23, 2016, in the backyard of my next-door neighbor.  We were enjoying dinner on her patio and using a star gazing app on my phone to identify stars and planets.  Below is a description I wrote down shortly after the event to preserve the details.   The first object traveled from the southeast toward my neighbor's house, in a northwesterly direction.  The light on the right appeared first.  I noticed it because i first thought it was a star.  When it moved I thought it was a plane.  It was some distance away (mile or more, so distant it looked like a small dot).  It started coming toward us.  I looked at it a couple of times and continued to notice it coming in our direction, still thinking it was just a plane.  I looked away again, but then a few minutes later, it was close to the roof line of the house at the end of the street (four houses away) and it didn't move any closer.  It just hovered.  The light got much brighter.  My neighbor's 9-year-old grand daughter was with me and said she saw it changing colors. Then I checked my flight radar app and saw there were no planes in the area.  When I looked up again, there was a second one (one on the left) but it was much dimmer than the one on the right.  They were spaced slightly further apart but then the dimmer one approached the larger one.  I snapped this photo just as they became about the same brightness.  They continued to hover there, the one on the left occasionally going behind the roof line of the house.  Altogether it was just a few minutes.   Then I looked away to say goodbye to one of my neighbors.  I helped my other neighbor, whose house I was at, clean up our dinner plates.  We went inside her house.  I didn't say anything to her about the lights because I knew she would be frightened by them.  When I went outside again a few minutes later and looked up, they were gone.  I wish I could have continued watching, but I didn't get to see where they went or how quickly they left. Please note that I live within 30 minutes of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, but as stated above, my radar app showed no planes in the immediate area, and the objects were too close to the roof line to have been planes.  They also traveled too great a distance to have been recreational drones, as I believe they would not have been within eye sight of any operator.  They made no sound.  Only my neighbor's grand daughter and I saw them.;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
