I had just barely passed Apogee Stadium by a few miles and didn’t even have to look up because it was so noticeable but I saw this teardrop looking figure with 1, maybe 2, lights underneath it appear in the sky. It was really bizarre and surreal to say the least.  I had never seen anything like it before. It appeared out of nowhere and then just like something in a movie, it sped up so fast it looked like it was entering warped speed, so fast that its figure literally stretched in present time and then disappeared. I'm a very logical person and felt crazy about it and just shared this story with someone at lunch and just for fun, they googled “UFO sighting 10/20/19 Denton, TX”, and to my surprise they found the exact same report filed in Denton, TX, at 1:24AM earlier this month.  This was pretty reassuring of what I saw which compelled me to share this report.  Especially since the last 2 reports have been in Denton County.;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
