I was working in my back yard right at dusk about 7:45 pm when I noticed distinctly noticed 2 objects in the sky. The first was the moon and the 2nd was a BRIGHT white light below it located in the NW sky. The object caught my eye because of the size and location it was much closer to the earth’s surface than any other stars I have ever seen. It wasn’t the North Star that’s for sure. Also the brightness of this object was amazing. As I looked at this bright white light I notice every 10 to 15 seconds that it would put of a reddish pulse around the stationary white light kind of a glow. This object resembled a star. It was not moving in any direction .It looked like it was in orbit kind of but slowly descending from below the moon. I know this wasn’t a star or airplane or satellite or anything I had ever seen before it was to close and to bright and the red pulse made it even stranger. At this point I was looking at it with my naked eye. I went in the house to grab my video camera the object didn’t appear to be going anywhere. I set my camera up on a tripod what I would see next as I zoomed in on the object was truly amazing and unreal. At this point my wife and two next door neighbors were looking at this thing with binoculars. As I zoomed in and focused on the light the object took shape and color it was oval looking and would kind of tear drop on the top and bottom. The light it was putting off was bright white and energetic looking and you could see small black circles around the entire object almost like heat vapors and then it would pulse a reddish glow. It looked like jet burst from behind the object. The bursts were not consistent and would last about 2 seconds, but the object didn’t appear to move. I now this sounds crazy but I got 45 minutes of this on video. I am trying to get it on my computer so I can send it in as well. The object would disappear into the fog layer that moved in. I cant explain any better. Did anyonelse see this?;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
