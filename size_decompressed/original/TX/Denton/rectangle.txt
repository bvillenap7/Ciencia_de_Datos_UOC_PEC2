Mass sighting of spaceship.;1988-07-07 22:00:00;5-10;Mass sighting of spaceship. My brother a mutual friend and I were out to meet a bunch of fellow high schooler in the summer of eighty-eight. The place was called the sherrifs posse out in the county. At first we noticed like a comet in the night sky but obviousely not a comet.Then, a minuete or two later a very large (mostly) rectangular spaceship was hovering over us and the surrounding area about one or two hundred feet above making no noise.  We knida pulled over and got out screaming at each other to remember what ot looks like. Some other cars pulled over and a few people came out of a couple of the houses. It looked like it eventually floated over looked as if it landed. We continued on to the meeting place to find chaos. Bout 30-40 folks freaking out and girls crying. The next day all I heard about it was that a Russian satelite had fallen.;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
