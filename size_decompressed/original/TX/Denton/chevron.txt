Amber colored, glowing chevron shaped object flew by overhead.;2008-01-20 23:55:00;2 seconds;Amber colored, glowing chevron shaped object flew by overhead. Hey,  Driving home, going SE on McKinney Rd here in Denton, my wife, ((name deleted)), and I saw a fast moving object flyby overhead. The sighting happened at 11:55 PM, January 20th.  Through the front windshield we both saw an amber colored, chevron shaped object. The object glowed, but appeared looked too low and big to be a shooting star. We barely had enough time to look up and remark on it, aproximately 2 seconds, before it disappeared.  The height and size of the object is impossible for us to properly determine. However, a rough estimate would make it about the size of an asprin at arm's length, and 1,500 ft in altitude.  The weather conditions are as follows: Temp 41. Wind Chill 32. Partly cloudy. SSE Wind 20mph. Gusts 30. Visibility 10 miles. Humidity 44%. Barometric pressure steady. Moon near full.  No noise was heard by either of us.  Sadly, I was without camera or video so I couldn't document it, other than posting it here and elsewhere as a case file.  Thanks, Lance Oliver, Founder Denton Area Paranormal Society ((NUFORC Note:  We have elected to leave the name of the witness in the report, given that he is known in the field of investigation of unusual phenomena.
