Driving from Denton, TX to Corinth, TX shiny saucer appeared next to airplanes;2005-10-09 14:12:00;2 - 3 minutes;Driving from Denton, TX to Corinth, TX shiny saucer appeared next to airplanes I was driving from Denton to Corinth,  I work at ((deleted--retail store))  in Corinth and I was on my way to work.  As I was driving on I-35, I noticed a plane in the sky heading south west and next to the plane seemed to be a flying saucer, it looked almost like a frisbee and it gleamed like a mirror in the sky.  It wasn't moving at all, it looked like it was just watching the plane pass by and all of a sudden it just disappeared.  I kept driving and kept looking in the sky and I saw another plane, but this one was headed east.  Out of no where it appeared next to this plane and did the same thing, just stayed in the sky as if it was watching the plane pass by.  After the plane passed by it disappeared again.  I saw it again one last time.  Another plane was heading south east and I noticed the saucer, but this time it was further away from the plane.  I glanced back at the road to make sure I was driving ok and when I looked back up it was gone.  When I got to work I stayed in the parking lot for 10 minutes just looking in the sky and watching more airplanes pass by, but I didn't see it again after that.   This happened on October 9th, 2005 and a halfmoon has been visible all day even with the sun out, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but this is all I can remember.;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239

Of course my first thought was it must be a plane.  It was traveling at a leisurely pace from the northeast to the southwest. I observed it from tree line to tree line. I looked at it intensely and could see no wings or protrusions of any kind, and determined that it was a disc shape with a domed top. The sky was very clear and there was also a small plane in another part of the sky that I could look at for comparison.  It was a little higher in the sky than the plane, but appeared to be approximately the same size. This looked nothing like the plane. It was very shiny white/silver and as mentioned before no wings, or tail, or rudder.  It traveled from tree line to tree line, so I saw it from different angles. It went behind the trees and I could no longer see it. It made no sound and as before I could hear the plane;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
I went outside to have my afternoon break, which today was at 5:25.;2008-08-08 17:25:00;5 minutes or more;I went outside to have my afternoon break, which today was at 5:25. I happened to look up and see the same object as I had seen the day before. It was shiny white/silver disc shape with a domed top. It was traveling from the northeast to the southwest, traveling at a leisurely pace. This time it traveled from the tree line to the north across the sky in front of me until it almost reached the tree line to the south, at which time it turned around and traveled back to the northeast. So again I saw this object from many angles.  I was able to watch it for at least five minutes or more. Today there was also a small plane in another part of the sky a little lower than the object, but I was able to compare the two and see that this object was not a plane. It also appeared to be about the same size as the plane but with no wings, or tail, or rudder. The sky was clear except for a few cirrus clouds to the northeast. When the object turned going back in the direction that it had come from it passed behind the cirrus clouds, yet I was still able to see it. I also could hear no sound and I could hear the plane. ((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports witness submits in five days from Cross Roads, TX.  We do not know what she is witnessing, but we would be surprised if all four objects were bona fide alien craft.  PD));33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239

Its vertical and horizontal movement is I saw UFOs in the sky, which are much higher than a airline in terms of altitude.  The shape of UFO is the combination of two hemispheres up and down with a dish between them.  The radius of dish is twice of that of hemisphere.  I guess that it is the typical UFO shape. Its color is bright silver. It seems that they play around there. They flight up and down so easily and in curved path. In addition to that, the smooth and sharp curves are observed in the path of the UFO.  They disappear and appear in the sky.  The speed of UFO is amazing.  Since I saw the flight in the sky, I can compare between the UFO and the airline.  I can tell that the UFO can flight at least several times faster than the airline.  I think there are at least more than 10 UFOs.  The maximum number of UFO in my camera at the same time was 7.  Since there was no cloud in the sky and they were in the high altitude, it was not easy for people to observe it.  I don't think other people observed them.  I asked one of my friends to see that.  He was taking a nap at the moment.  He missed it.  When I moved to the other place to get a tripod, but I could not observe them for the brightness from the sun.  My apartment has a door to the east.  Because of appropriate shield, I could find them.  They were above me and a little bit in the east.;33.212077206947;-97.1221538350239
