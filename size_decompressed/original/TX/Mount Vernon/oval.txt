Large green object streaks across East Texas sky.;2011-03-12 22:35:00;5 seconds;Large green object streaks across East Texas sky. My friend and I were sitting by the lake on a very dark, but clear night. We were discussing life, in general, when a large flash of white light interrupted our conversation. We both stopped talking and looked upward, thinking that someone had turned on a light on their home’s exterior or lit a firework, but as we looked into the sky, a large green circular object streaked across a small section of the sky and disappeared. The object was bluish-green and had a glowing intensity to it. It was larger than the half-moon that was present for the whole night. One of us saw it as a C-shape, almost like the curved, solid side was slicing across the sky and the green light filled the “cavity” behind the edge of it. I saw it as a disk with a small space in the front, very similar to the “Millennium Falcon” from the Star Wars films. I saw green-lit patterns on the bottom. We both know it seems crazy, but after both of us viewed the phenomenon, we sat for about 10 seconds. Then both of us asked if the other had seen the same thing. Our stories lined up perfectly and we were a bit doubtful at first. Then after 2-3 minutes of discussion, we heard a sound very similar to that made by a plane breaking the sound barrier. It was also synonymous with the “thud” made by a large object making impact in the earth. We both heard the noise as well. Neither of us are fanatics about UFOs or extraterrestrial life, but we aren’t completely closed-minded to the possibilities of not being alone in this universe.;33.1728;-95.2159
