Saw something bright orange out of the corner of my eye so I quickly grabbed my 20x80 binoculars.   At first by just looking at it with a naked eye it seemed to just be a single orange light but under magnification I saw the three orange circle lights at each corner of the craft.   It moved fast across the horizon.  Much faster than a jet but slower than a meteor.   After 15 seconds or so it disappeared.
