5 round orb-like lights gliding over the nights sky.;2009-06-28 23:30:00;2 and a half  minutes;5 round orb-like lights gliding over the nights sky. I was walking home from a friends house at approximately 11:30pm central time when noticed what i thought at the time was a couple of fire flies in a tree to east of me. Upon closer inspection i noticed that the faint round orbs were not in the tree but in the sky. there were 3  round orbs in a straight line, with the first UFO just slightly more ahead of the two in back. then i noticed another 2 orbs following the same path as ones in front of them but unlike the first 3 UFOs the last 2 were side by side. From a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the fastest) , the speed of the orbs were going at about 6. they were round in shape and had a moderate white/cream colored glow around them. from my view they looked like they were about the size of quarters. they also made no sound. and were nothing like anything i have ever seen in the sky before. After witnessing these UFOS going further east for approximately 2 and a half minutes  they were no longer in my view. I had run back to my friend's house to ask them if they had seen anything in the sky because they were sitting outside  just after i had left and all 3 had said no. It was a clear night, not a cloud in the sky, and i could hardly make out any stars due to the amount of lights around the area, but the orbs that had caught my attention were clear as day when i had seen them.;29.4509999999997;-98.6169000000008
