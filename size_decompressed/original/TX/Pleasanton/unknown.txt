Object moved with uncertainty and vanished.;1997-10-03 02:00:00;7 minutes;Object moved with uncertainty and vanished. I spoted the object out to the south. It appeared to be some distance away. It apeared from the east. it shot down from the sky in an inverted arc and hovered over the horizon for a moment. It then began moving very slowly to the east. Next the object made a large triangular traverse. This movment lead me to rule out atmospheric distortion of a star as a cause. When it returned to its original location it then shot straight up and vanished. The object had some type of visual field around it. It was changing colors between red, orange, and blue.;28.995;-98.4854999999999
