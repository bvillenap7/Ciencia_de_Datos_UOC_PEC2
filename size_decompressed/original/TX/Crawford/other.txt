Glowing Lights Over President Bush's Ranch;2003-12-04 22:00:00;10 minutes;Glowing Lights Over President Bush's Ranch Beginning in December of last year I saw three odd objects over President Bush's ranch here in Central Texas. I am an amateur astronomer and often go out into the country to stargaze on clear nights. On three separate occasions I have seen these objects, which appear to be brilliant green or blue lights that are so bright I am amazed no one else has reported them. The first time I saw them I was certain there would be something in the paper about them the next day but there was nothing. They were as bright as a full moon and came in three flares.;31.5623;-97.3922
