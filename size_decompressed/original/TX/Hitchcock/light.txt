Strange Lights In the Texas Sky;2005-04-22 21:27:00;Two minutes;Strange Lights In the Texas Sky My mother and I were driving home from our church seminar tonight and, at about 9:27 PM (central time), I saw a two dark yellow square lights hovering in the sky that were so close together that they almost looked like a single horizontal-ish light. They looked like lit-up windows one might see in a house from far away. In retrospect, I am pretty sure that they were two separate lights (or lit windows) on a single craft because there was a definite curve in the lights, as if they were curving around the craft. It was not an airplane it wasn't moving at all and it certainly was not a star or planet. Believe me, I can tell the difference and this was not something you normally see in the sky. The lights or whatever they were a part of did not move at all they remained perfectly still. Anyways, I tell my mom, who was driving, Look. That doesn't look like a star and it's not moving. What the heck is that? So, she looks. Moments later, the light dimmed over the span of about two seconds until it was out. I'm a pretty sensible person, but this definitely wasn't normal. By the way, my mother and I are the only witnesses that I know of, unless somebody else saw the anomaly in the sky like we did.;29.3371;-94.9904
