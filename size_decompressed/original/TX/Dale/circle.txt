3 UFO's over Central Texas;2002-06-15 21:56:00;7 min. approx.;3 UFO's over Central Texas This sighting occurred on  Saturday, June 15, 2002. at 21:56.  I was out walking with the dog outside of my rural home when I noticed 3 large bright circular objects moving across the sky.  The objects were moving from the north west toward the south east.  They appeared to be following the same path the satellites follow, except the satellites travel a different direction before they disappear.   All 3 objects appeared to be at a fairly high altitude. They made no sound and did not have navigational lights no did they have FAA red and green strobe lights.  They were round white lights. One of the UFO’s was moving fairly slow almost stopping from time to time.  The second was moving faster and the third object was moving very fast.  All three objects were moving across the sky in a  erratic manner, traveling in circles and moving forward then stopping and moving backwards.  At one point the slower UFO #1 started to travel to the south east. UFO #2 was zig zagging across the sky at a high speed and flew directly across the path of the slower moving UFO #1.  I expected to see and hear a loud explosion but somehow they avoided a collision. The 3 UFO’s continued to move in a random pattern across the sky for almost 7 minutes. They finally regrouped and flew south east in a single line and disappeared. There were no witnesses to this sighting and I did not contact any law enforcement agencies to report this sighting.   This is all of the information I have on this incident. I am reporting this incident 7 years late because internet service just recently became available in our rural area.;29.9521;-97.5831
