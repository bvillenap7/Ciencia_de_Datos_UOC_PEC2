Disappeared behind some trees next to our house.  Wife and I both saw it only 100 feet away for about a minute before it disappeared.  Around 8 feet in diameter.  “Floating” erratically but still with direction on a windless night.  Thought it was a drone, but no sound, and was very thin.  Had a shimmer across the whole round surface like an infrared camera at night when it caught the light at a certain angle, but at other angles was translucent like a jellyfish.  Very strange indeed.
