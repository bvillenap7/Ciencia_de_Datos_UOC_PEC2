When straight overhead, the single light turned into two lights, went farther east and disappeared. No sounds, altitude unkn. I was standing in my backyard watching the sky when I noticed a single light in the western sky approaching. I thought it was a satellite, judging by the speed it was traveling. When it was straight above, still traveling east, it appeared to split and become two white lights. Then, within 2 or 3 seconds, they disappeared. No sound was heard. Dogs were barking in the neighborhood. Event occurred at 19:42hrs.;30.4420934426231;-97.6338683606563
I had just watched the shuttle and space station cross over from nw to se.;2002-06-15 22:05:00;1.5 min.;I had just watched the shuttle and space station cross over from nw to se. Then about 2 mins after a twice as large sta5r looking thing went north to south just as fast. It was too hogh for a plane and had no blinking lights. However, when it got south its light faded out as though it had one big white kight on the bottom. Soon after another one went by just as high and fast. I have no idea what they were. I have never seen such a thing. Mabey the are friends.;30.4420934426231;-97.6338683606563
A brilliant, slow moving light, sped up and disappeared!;2005-12-25 20:11:00;15 sec;A brilliant, slow moving light, sped up and disappeared! This was unlike anything I've ever seen! I was star-gazing when I noticed a very bright light. It was an odd blueish white, quite brilliant. It was steady and had absolutely no flicker to it. As I focused on it, I noticed that it was moving slowly, as I have seen satalites move in the past. Then it sped up and traveled a short distance and disappeared completely!  I have seen hundreds of falling stars, many satalites moving in the night sky and countless planes, but this was totally different. The movement coupled with the brightness of the object are outside anything I have ever experienced. I was in shock for quite a while and still shake my head in amazment.;30.4420934426231;-97.6338683606563
Sitting at a stoplight at FM685 and TX45, I saw what looked like a bright star over Hendrickson H. S..  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));2015-10-02 06:27:00;4 minutes;As I was driving to work, sitting at the southbound stoplight at FM685 and TX45, I saw what looked like a bright star over Hendrickson High School.  It started moving like an airplane but then stopped and changed directions.   As the stop light turned green, I tried to keep my eye on it but driving became difficult and I was too late to work to pull over to watch it.   I was thinking and hoping it was someone playing with a drone, but I cannot be sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  We are not certain as to whether the sighting occurred in the morning, or the evening.  PD));30.4420934426231;-97.6338683606563
Three Strange Orbs Ascend Over Pflugerville, Texas During New Year's Fireworks.;2020-01-01 00:01:00;2:30 minutes;Three Strange Orbs Ascend Over Pflugerville, Texas During New Year's Fireworks At approximately midnight on New Years 2020, I walked out onto back porch in Pflugerville Texas to admire fireworks on the horizon.  During the display, I witnessed three orbs ascended into the air. At first thought, I was trying to figure what kind of firework they were. Then I realized they were too in sync to be fireworks.  They had almost the exact distance from one another too close together to be commercial air planes.  It would be like planes taking off from an aircraft carrier in the heat of battle.  From the ground Iâ€™d say just a few hundred yards from each other.  The orbs were sparkly, not blinking, not red, blue or white.  They were like the glow of sky lanterns but obviously they were in a synchronized flight pattern ascending into the air until they disappeared over the clouds.  The fact it happened during the midnight firework display was almost as if they were trying to camouflage themselves.  I was lucky enough to get my phone out and snap video of! the lights.  Researching online, I found a similar encounter with three orbs back in 2015.  The witnesses photo's and video look very similar to what I witnessed on this night.;30.4420934426231;-97.6338683606563
