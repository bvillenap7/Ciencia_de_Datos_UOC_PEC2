Fireballs over central TX.;2016-09-04 21:00:00;1 hour;fireballs over central TX BBQing and watching the UT Football game.  While outside observed multiple fireballs traveling from South to North.  Continued to watch and observed many of the same.  Would have assumed a meteor shower, but a few of them broke trajectory and travelled East / West from initial path.  Rough video on IPhone, not nearly as clear as watching live, but this certainly did not seem like a natural event.
