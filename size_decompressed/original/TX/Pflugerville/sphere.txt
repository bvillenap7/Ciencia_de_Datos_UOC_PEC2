As we rounded a slight curve i saw a Orange ball above the ball was a slight smoke trail like a flare would leave. I thought it was a flare at first but it did not fall it remained exactly inplace.  I pulled over and backed up to where we were directly facing it and turned off my engine.  The object remain inplace about 150 feet infront and about 30 feet off the ground.  It  glowed but didnt illuminate the area around it. We sat their looking at it and I flashed my headed lights at it a few times untill my son ask me to stop.  Where we lived was around 25 miles from bergstrom AFB and i heard a jet coming real fast towards us.  I looked to see if I could spot it but couldnt.  When i looked back the globe was not visible.  I thought it was gone when I noticed their was three faint red lights in the shape of a triangle Two on the bottom and one on top.  The jet was really moving on us when the lights just took off at a unbelievable rate of speed.  Like nothing I have seen before.  Im pretty sure the jet was a F4 thats what was out at bergstrom at the time.  they were set up with cameras and im sure other monitering devices they all were.  thats what me and my son saw if he wasnt with me i wouldnt be writing this.;30.4420934426231;-97.6338683606563
