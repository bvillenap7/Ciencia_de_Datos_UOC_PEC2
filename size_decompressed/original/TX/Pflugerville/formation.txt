On the date of Wednesday, September 7, 2011, in the city of Pflugerville, TX, I was driving east on Parmer Lane between 9 and 10pm, stopped at the traffic light about to turn north on Harris Ridge Blvd when I observed what I thought initially was a standard commercial airplane flying along the horizon northward.  Having looked at a map I would approximate it was on the latitude between Elgin and Bastrop, TX.  The craft was an estimated 3 to 20 miles away (distances are hard to approximate). It consisted of 2 to 3 yellowish orange lights that moved in exact unity, so as to give the appearance of a single craft. Initially it was moving at a normal speed for a commercial aircraft.  (I assumed it was an airplane since I live north of Austin airport and regularly see airplanes at night.)  After 5 to 8 seconds of flying parallel to the horizon, it suddenly made a swooping descent, covering what I estimated to be at least 3,000 feet in less than 2 seconds, then disappe! aring behind the trees near horizon. My reaction was to think, Wow, that airplane is going down!  After several minutes of thought when it disappeared, I realized it could not have been a standard plane for 2 reasons: 1) It was clearly going too fast, even for a downed aircraft, and 2) A standard aircraft doesn't spontaneously change speeds like that. The descent of the craft was not straight down but rather in an arc motion, appearing as if it was not a fall or trajectory but a controlled descent at a speed which was alarming enough to grab my attention. After it disappeared behind the trees, I did not see it again.  Several days later I thought to look on the map (this is how I estimated the geographical area and direction) and made a connection that this was near or around the Texas wildfires in Bastrop area. At the time of witnessing the event, I made no connection between the UFO and the wildfires. After connecting the two, I thought it might be explained as an aerial firefighting craft. But then discarded this idea for two reasons: 1) Nothing was dropped by the craft, but rather the craft itself dropped, and 2) I called all the police departments in the area and was told there were no downed aircraft of any kind.;30.4420934426231;-97.6338683606563
Random formation of bright orange lights reduces into triangle before extinguishing.;2014-01-19 19:20:00;I saw the last minute of ;Random formation of bright orange lights reduces into triangle before extinguishing I walked out from my apartment to the parking lot, and immediately saw an array of 7-9 bright orange/bright yellow balls flying from eastern direction toward north west. At first, I thought it was military helicopters flying in formation, but none of the light were blinking, and as the objects got closer, it was clear these were much higher, and traveling much faster (yet slower than orbiting IIS).  Several people in the parking lot were already looking and people said things like, What is it?  After 30 seconds from the start of my sighting, all but three lights shut off.  The remaining three lights created a triangle. However these weren't red, they changed from yellow to orange. Approx. 10 seconds after the triangle formation, the remaining lights seemed to extinguish at slightly different times.;30.4420934426231;-97.6338683606563
