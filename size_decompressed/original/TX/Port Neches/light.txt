Star like UFO moving then climbed out of sight.;2013-05-27 22:00:00;10 seconds;star like UFO moving then climbed out of sight Around ten oâ€™clock PM the electricity was out and my spouse and myself was outside to see what happened. I looked up at the sky to view the stars, while looking I could see the stars slightly clearer since several blocks were out of electricity.   I was looking in a southeasterly direction and one star began to move I told my wife to look and she saw it as well, the star (UFO) starting moving north and got smaller and smaller (climbing in altitude I suspect) until it was no longer visible.   The ufo was twinkling just like any other star in the sky but it started moving after watching it for a few seconds just sitting still.  The encounter took no longer then maybe 5-10 seconds at the most.  Lately I have been seeing things like this lot (this is my 4-5 sighting this year).;29.9792;-93.9545999999998
