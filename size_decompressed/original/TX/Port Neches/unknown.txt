Seven Very Fast Flying Objects Twirling Around At Incredible Speeds And Monuvers;2005-08-29 23:30:00;1.5 hours;Seven Very Fast Flying Objects Twirling Around At Incredible Speeds And Monuvers Appeared to be shooting stars at first. The objects began twirling around in all sorts of directions. No airplane or any other object could make moves like this. They were moving around in a way to seem they were playing or chasing each other. The movements and speed was of no explanation. They appeared to be very far away, like I said they looked like stars at first. Imagine seven people in a dark room with laser pointers twirling them around on the wall. They would come and go as to disappear, or move so fast to be going out of sight for brief moments. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with these witnesses via telephone, and found them to be seemingly quite credible.  PD));29.9792;-93.9545999999998
Orange light over Port Neches, Texas;2011-07-19 22:30:00;2 minutes;Orange light over Port Neches, Texas A single orange object was seen moving from S to N, as I was looking in a westwardly direction.  It seemed to be a few thousand feet in the air. but this is only a guess.  It moved slowly across the sky, moving neither up nor down, only parallel to the ground.  The sky was clear. The wind was calm at ground level.  At first it appeared to be an orange-red light, but as it moved across the sky it began to fade until it dissapeared.  Their were no red or white light associated with it.  The light did not flicker at all, it only faded.  It did not fade as it went to the horizon, it faded halfway between the horizons.  It made no noise.  I frequently watch the skies, so I know it was not a plane or other convention aircraft.  We had thunderstorms 12 hours prior to the sighting, but as I said, it was clear and calm.  Temperature was approximately 80 dcegrees.;29.9792;-93.9545999999998
