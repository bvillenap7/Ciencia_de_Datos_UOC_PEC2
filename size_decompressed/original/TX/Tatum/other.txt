Planes or UFO's in East Texas?;2010-02-05 19:50:00;5-10 minutes;Planes or UFO's in East Texas? Was outside my house when I saw an aircraft moving very fast and going in many directions.  As it left over the horizon another aircraft came from below the horizon, maybe the ground and headed straight for the other aircraft and passed by it as it went out of site.  Then the second aircraft flew with great speed and had rotating lights (Blue, green, red, an white) that went faster than any airplane that I have witnessed.   After it went out of sight, two more aircraft came from the east and was also flying very low and at great speeds with the same rotating lights that were on the second aircraft.  Probably were planes, but nothing like I have seen before.  May have been military planes from Barksdale Air Force, but again nothing that I have seen moves that fast or can change directions that quick.  Weird night.   My 4 year old kept saying that aliens were coming and my wife and I laughed, but who knows. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
