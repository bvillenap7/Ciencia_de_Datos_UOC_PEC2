I thought it to be Satellites;2001-05-10 23:20:00;3 minutes;I thought it to be Satellites My wife and I saw three distant lights flying by the Big dipper.  The lights were symetrical in shape to that of a triangle.  each light represented the tip of a triangle.(connect the dots)  The lights never devated from the distant of each other light.  It stayed the same distant and travelled straight on a heading from nw to se.  It finally reached the light pollution and we lost sight of it.  Never heard a noise.  At first I thought it was a couple of satellites but I have never seen satellites travel at the same speed or the same flight path so uniformly.  I can say this as it past a star in the outlined area I could see that star so it either was hollow or beyond the stars.  I just do not know what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  The report is consistent with several other reports NUFORC has received of these three lights, apparently orbitting in unwavering formation.  A similar phenomenon has been reported in past years, and we believe they may be three satellites placed in orbit by the U. S. Navy.  The program is referred to as the N.O.S.S. satellite surveillance system.  We do not know what purpose the satellites have.  PD));33.233;-98.1646
