Daytime Light near Bowie, Tx;2006-04-03 13:55:00;30 sec;Daytime Light near Bowie, Tx I was traveling east on Hiway 287 towards Bowie, Texas, I happened to look up and see a Bright Light that was like a teardrop-but sideways come into view, it appeared to be traveling south, and then changed size to a light-dot? then appeared to turn east (now on the south side of the road- road did not change direction), then simply faded out. No other signs, there were high clouds, but I am not certain how high the object was, but it was below cloud cover. I am a trucker and I occasionally post here.;33.556;-97.8328
