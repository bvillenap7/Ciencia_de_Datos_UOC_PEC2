I kept on driving and approx 1 minute later, I caught waht seemed to be another one do the same thing from a different det of hills. At first I thought it was just a glare off of one of the many wind towers, but after taking a second glance it just seemed to be something stange. Nothing wierd happened, and it was only for a second, I don't know if it is even worth reporting?? One minute they were there, the next, they were flat gone.
