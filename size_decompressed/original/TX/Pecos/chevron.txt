We were traveling Route #10 through west Texas just outside of Pecos.  At mile marker #205 I sighted lights off over a field approximately 2 miles away.  The object had three lights on top, two red lights on the perimeters and one white light centered.  I told my wife to look and we watched for about two minutes when the object flew straight at our car.  The object gave the feeling that it just suddenly was there next to us.  It had banked showing us the underside, hovering over the median, then swooped over the car, righted itself and speed off behind us.  At that time we lost sight of it.  The underside displayed three small, dull, lights in a triangular form with two dull concentric circles of light.  The shape of the craft was generally batwinged with a central payload area.  The coloring seemed to be a deep slate grey, almost black, leaving a dark on dark image in the sky.  On the forward area of the payload area there was a half moon cut out with two pointed antenna.  It made no sound and no exhaust.  I am retired from the military with 23 years of service.  I worked in communications with military aircraft.  My wife has been in retail most of her life.;31.4467;-103.5791
