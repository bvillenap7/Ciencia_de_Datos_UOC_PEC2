Jet following white blinking object.;2003-07-01 00:00:00;10 min;Jet following white blinking object. I was driving back to Odessa from El Paso just south of Pecos, when I noticed a white light blinking on and off in the distance to my right. It was a clear still night so the light had my total attention. I watched it for about 1-2 minutes still driving when at a very high rate of speed suddently shot down at an angle to the ground and out of my view. I could still see the glow of the light still blinking in the horizen but not the object itself. I was in disbelief of what I had just seen when a jet flew right over my me from behind, I never saw him coming! The jet was so low it shook my truck and the flames from the afterburners were so clear! The jet turned off in the direction where the object had came down. I drove straight through Pecos and tried to find the jet or light again but could not. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));31.4467;-103.5791
