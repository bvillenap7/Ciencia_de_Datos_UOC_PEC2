This has been going on during spring and summer months for two years.  Large, quiet, pulsating lights east and west usually.  They move slowly into place then stop.   I live in rural area surrounded by nature.  Nights the lights are here you can hear a pin drop with only domestic dogs barking, and I mean all barking.  We have large coyote population which makes for loud nights.  When lights are in the sky, they do no make a sound.  EVER. Early February I was playing fetch with my dog at sunset.  Within minutes of darkness, here they come again, only they were followed by airplanes I could hear.  Flying in circles over four towns.I watched as the pulsating light lashed so bright I covered my eyes, my dog ran in the house I was frozen.  Then a small airplane buzzed over me so close I could have seen pilot in daylight.  Small plane with no landing gear (not a crop duster)  It was dark in color smooth underneath sounded jet like?  The lights in sky disappeared until last night. They are back and I wish they would go somewhere else.;32.2686;-97.183
