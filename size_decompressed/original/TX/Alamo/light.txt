I witnessed what I can only describe as a light that looked almost like a star. The object was moving northwest in the sky going straight but was also zig zagging.  I told my uncle to go get some other family members to come out and see the light, but as they came out the light started ascending up further into the atmosphere.    As i was watching it go further up the light slowly got dimmer and dimmer, but stayed almost exactly in the same spot in the sky.  This is the second or third time I've seen this happen.  I cant recall the exact date, but it was the exact same description.  A light that looked the exact same color as a bright star.  This was a few months ago same location i'm not sure if this helps, but there it is.;26.1974;-98.1184
