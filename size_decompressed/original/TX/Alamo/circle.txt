Eclipse or UFO?;1991-07-20 23:00:00;unkown;Eclipse or UFO? I remember only that I was 6 years old and that one night I was looking at the full moon during the summer and that it started to eclipse. I was fascinated so I just stared. At the time I didn't know it but I didn't know that we weren't supposed to stare at the centers of eclipses but I remebered that there were no eclipses due to appear so I just stared. All I remember was the after blinking a few times I seemed to have lost track of time and so I just went out...I just closed my eyes. The next thing I know, I'm in my living room standing in wonder, How did I get there? I know that the ufo was circular because it made an eclipsing effect on the full moon. When I tried to check my watch, it had stopped and didn't show any time. Thank you for listening to my entry, I'm glad to get that off my shoulders. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
