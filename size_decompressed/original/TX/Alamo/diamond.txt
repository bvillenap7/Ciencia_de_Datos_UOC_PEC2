I stared at them and asked my kids if they were seeing what I was seeing and they told me yes.  As we got in the van and I started to drive the ufo started moving in our direction.  My kids were just starring at it and it had a lot of lights.  It was just moving along next to us but in the sky.  Suddenly it past us and then it went side ways and headed back towards us and there it was next to us again.  No sound ever came out of it like an airplane or helicopter.  It was silent with little movement.  As we got to Burger King it disappeared.  When we got home I asked the kids to draw what they had seen and the drew a plate like image with lights on it.  No one beliefs us.;26.1974;-98.1184
