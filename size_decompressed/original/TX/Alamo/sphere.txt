Moving fast. Right before the sun went down when there was still light in the sky we saw 2 silver discs or tubes in the sky very high in the sky.  Not nearly as high as a satellite but still pretty high, nonetheless.  At first we only saw one tube close to the area were the moon was that evening.  Then my friend pointed out another one following it.  They were moving about as fast as an airplane I would say, but these did NOT have wings, did not have any lights and they did not make any sound.  They were just silver tubes in the sky and kept moving until they were completely out of sight.  We even called the McAllen International Airport to report this but the lady just told us that it could possibly be aircraft spraying for mosquitoes.  I told her these were not planes and she said that was all the info she could give me.;26.1974;-98.1184
