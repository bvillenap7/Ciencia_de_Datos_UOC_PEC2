Lit object spotted near aircraft.;2003-10-18 18:43:00;2 seconds;Lit object spotted near aircraft. My husband and I were traveling north on Travis when I happened to look at the sunset and noticed what looked like a star moving across the sky.  I though it might be an airplane with the sun glinting off it.  Then I saw an actual plane a little further west and it looked exactly like an airplane should.  I turned my attention back to the star object and it seemed to turn sideways.  Once it did that, the light was gone from the object and it looked like a dark ball which had been pinched in on either side, almost a rounded convex shape.  Then it completely disappeared.  It didn't speed off, but winked out.;30.0931;-94.7344
