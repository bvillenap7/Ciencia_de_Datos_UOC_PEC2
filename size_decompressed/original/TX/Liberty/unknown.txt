Vertical arrangement of lights with synchronized rapid movement.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 06:00:00;5 minutes;Vertical arrangement of lights with synchronized rapid movement I witnessed a vertical arrangement of lights in the south-eastern sky.  The lights had the color, size, & shape of stars.  When I first saw them, they were approximately 60 degrees from the horizon in a stationary position.  There were 5-10 lights in the formation comprising an arc of no more than 10 degrees from top to bottom. As I took out my phone to take video, they started to move.  The movement appeared to be a dropping motion toward the ground.  As I continued to observe, the lights appeared to dim and move a little closer to one another.  This led me to believe the object, instead of moving downward, was probably moving away at a very high rate of speed.  They maintained their vertical alignment while moving and were gone from sight in less than 30 seconds. My video unfortunately was too dark to make out any of the lights.;30.0931;-94.7344
