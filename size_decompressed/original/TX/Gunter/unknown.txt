Large weird Smoke Ring near Gunter, Texas.;2012-01-28 15:30:00;15 minutes;Large weird Smoke Ring near Gunter, Texas. Our family was traveling in the outskirts of Dallas, Texas.  Our GPS led us astray, and somehow we got off track, and started traveling down gravel roads instead of the turnpike which we should have taken in the first place.  We were traveling down this little highway when I looked up and noticed this black smoke ring up in the clouds.  Nothing else in the sky even resembled it, and I didn’t see any air craft in the area at all. In fact I took pictures of it and I had it in my view for miles.  I commented on it to my husband.  We live in Missouri, so I am not familiar with this area at all.  The closet town that we came to was Gunter, Texas. In one of the pictures I saw different crafts that I didn’t see with my eyes.  I thought it may have been dirt and grime on the wind shield, but if that we true the dirt would show up in the other frames.   This reminded me of something a smoker would puff up in the air but the smoke was very dark. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.4467;-96.7369
