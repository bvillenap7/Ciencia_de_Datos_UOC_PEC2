I Saw a bright light in the northern sky moving east to west faster than a normal aircraft. I thought it was a satellite until it made several sharp turns left to right and right to left at slow and fast speeds.  The object was brighter than the north star and appeared high enough to be reflecting the sun.  It began a series of figure eights and widening them as it flew.  It then appeared to hover or stand still until it moved off to the west at a high rate of speed and disappeared.;33.4467;-96.7369
