Large low flying UFO 18 miles outside of Cotulla, TX;2012-06-29 22:20:00;5 seconds;Large low flying UFO 18 miles outside of Cotulla, TX I saw strange lights bundled together...some blinking.  Instantly I could tell it was out of the ordinary so II pulled over and jumped out to take a phone pic  but as soon as i was going to the lights turned off.   The moon was very bright with clear skies but I still could not see anything there anymore.  The object was low flying....about 3 or 4 hundred feet.  It's lights were amazing.   It was very large...about 200 feet long and the bundle of lights were going from one end to the other.   With the horizon it was at a 40 degree angle.   Maybe moving about 50 mph.  The background was brush and the UFO was about 1 mile from an oil rig.   I was observing the rig and UFO in the same view.;28.4432;-99.2326
