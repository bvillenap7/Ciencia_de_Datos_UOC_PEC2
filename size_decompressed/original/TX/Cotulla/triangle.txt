Bright yellowish/orange in color lights, form triangle shape in the skies over Cotulla Texas!;2010-04-08 22:00:00;1 min;Bright yellowish/orange in color lights, form triangle shape in the skies over Cotulla Texas! This is the second time we see the lights, and it’s been over a year since the last time we saw the lights. I just recently reported the last sighting that took place over a year ago. Tonight as I drove up to my sister’s house which is in the exact same spot where we saw the light’s over a year ago, they appeared in the sky again. This time the lights appeared one after another in the west mid section of the skies. The colors of the light's were yellowish to orange and very bright. As they appeared in the sky they formed a triangle shape. When the fourth light appeared, it appeared beside the triangle form then they faded out in the same spot where they stood.  They did not move like the lights that we had seen before. This took no more than one minute. Then there were again, what looked like jets, very high in altitude. The lights were white and blinking and very small as if they were very far or high in the sky. Many people have seen and have described the! same sightings tonight.;28.4432;-99.2326
