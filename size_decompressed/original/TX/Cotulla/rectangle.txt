Small, bright, yellow/orange lights in a pattern and on same plane;2011-07-26 19:30:00;15 seconds;small, bright, yellow/orange lights in a pattern and on same plane Driving South on IH 35,  North of Cotulla about Gardendale exit, low in the Western sky,  I saw a perfectly shaped and on same plane rectangle arrangement of small bright yellow/orange point of light. As I drove South,  the rectangle did not move,  however the short ends condensed into each other,  forming 2 lights.  Then the two lights faded, with the center being a very dark red and disappeared.    Not sure,  but coincidentally my iPhone went haywire.  I was on a call, got dropped, I could not terminate the call and I could not turn off the phone for over 5 minutes. I have never seen this sort of thing before.    I told my wife last night,  here in Laredo, Tx as we were driving home from dinner, at 9:15pm, and not even 5 minutes after I described what I had seen,    we saw 3 lights to the North, low in the sky,  just like I had seen last week in Cotulla,  70 miles North of Laredo.  I would not describe as a triangle arrangement,  however,  all the lights were on the same plane,  and disappeared in similar fashion after about 10 seconds.    My wife confirmed she too had seen them - small, bright, yellow/orange lights and dark red center when they disappeared. -  No noticeable movement ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
