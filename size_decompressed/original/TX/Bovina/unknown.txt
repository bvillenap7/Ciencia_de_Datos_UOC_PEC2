Blue & White Lights;1996-07-01 19:00:00;2 minutes;Blue & White Lights My sister, her year-old daughter and I were driving back to Portales NM from Amarillo TX.  A few miles east of Bovina, we saw blue and white flashing lights in the trees of the town.  We thought there had been a wreck or a policeman had someone pulled over.  But the lights rose above the trees, hovered for a few seconds, then streaked towards us.  The lights were too low to be that of a plane and moved too quickly to be a helicopter.  The lights continued to move through the sky and disappeared into the horizon.  My sister has no memory of this.  I recently watched a UFO program on the History channel there was a segment about 2 airline pilots who saw similar lights in the same location.
