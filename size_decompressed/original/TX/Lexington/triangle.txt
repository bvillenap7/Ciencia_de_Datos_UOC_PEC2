Triangular craft observed in South Central Texas;2010-06-13 19:30:00;20 minutes;Triangular craft observed in South Central Texas Looking for satellites to show my daughter, thought at first I was seeing a satellite but noticed it began changing direction, sometime rather jerky and sometimes smoothly.  At times it appeared to be displaying lights, red, green and maybe blue.  Watched it for approximately 20 minutes. It was approx 50 degrees above the Eastern horizon in a North Northeast location when first observed and last seen at almost 90 degrees.  To the younger eyes of my daughter it appeared to be triangular.  At one point we observed a very high, fast aircraft in the vicinity.  The plane was flying from a Northeastern to North Northeaster direction.   We heard no engines of any aircraft at any time.;30.4208;-97.0558
