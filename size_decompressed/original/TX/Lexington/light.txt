Star-like light followed by normal air-craft;2013-06-25 21:00:00;5 minutes;Star-like light followed by normal air-craft On 06/24/13 my wife and stepped outside at about 2100. We witnessed a singular light high in the sky, virtually silent traveling from the nw to the se.  Not on the normal flight path to the south of us for ABIA.  It didn't do anything weird or crazy just an oddly bright star-like light.  Much brighter than a satellite and no blinking lights like a plane.  Within 10 to 15 minutes two jets of a fighter type came traveling from the se to the nw at varying altitudes almost retracing the lights path.  I'm an OIF Army vet and my wife was a Navy MA, we both have experience with flight lines and various aircraft.  The star-like light seemed abnormal, the fighter craft did not. Then again on 06/25/13 we stepped outside and planted some chairs to watch. We again witness the star-like light to the east traveling in a more n to s flight path. Again abnormal without blinking lights nor any sound.  We again witnessed two regular type craft approximately 20 to 25 minutes later retracing the star-like lights path.  Too far away to tell if they were fighters or not, but had blinking lights as normal.  Going out again tomorrow and going to try to film it if able.;30.4208;-97.0558
