Turned to yellow-orange color at 2:00 o'clock high before going out of sight. My husband, aged 59, and myself, aged 57, were traveling West in our car on Kilpatrick Street.  The light in the sky that we observed was oval in shape and silvery-blue in color.  The object was very high in the sky and appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length.  It traveled much faster than an airplane or jet and traveled across the sky from South to North and out of sight in a matter of about 7 seconds.  Just before it disappeared, it changed to a yellow-orange color.;32.3392261904761;-97.4142714285713

Three lights in a shape of  triangle, lights changed  positions four times.;2008-11-19 18:15:00;10 seconds;Three lights in a shape of  triangle, lights changed  positions four times. My boss and I took an smoke brake outside, the time was 18:15 PM I was looking at the night sky when I saw an UFO flying in very fast speed from south to North East. over Cleburne Texas. The UFO had 3 lights in a shape of a triangle.[ I do not know if it was one craft or three, because it had the three lights] it was very fast and traveled over the building in 7 to 10 seconds. The three lights changed positions 4 times that I could see. There was no sound and the UFO was flying very low. I am absolutely sure that this was an UFO I never ever seen anything like this before. My boss seen it to, but he does not believe anything like this, and acts like he did not see it, and does not even talk about it.;32.3392261904761;-97.4142714285713
Intensely brightly lit object sighted flying at low altitude and high speed.;2014-08-03 20:15:00;15 seconds;Intensely brightly lit object sighted flying at low altitude and high speed. Driving East from downtown Cleburne, I observed a large brilliant white light, similar in intensity to a welder's arc strobing in a 3 sec on/1 sec off pattern traveling south rapidly at low altitude, lower than the 200 foot relief hills behind the object. It disappeared before I could pull over for a better view.   I have never seen airplane or helicopter lights nearly that bright and no other lights were visible on the object. The intensity of the white light and speed of the object precluded identifying any shape, even though it was slightly before dusk and only about 1/4 mile distant.    I was unable to arrive at a plausible explanation for any ordinary object it could have been, hence this report.;32.3392261904761;-97.4142714285713
