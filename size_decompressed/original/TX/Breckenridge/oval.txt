Bright orange glow in the SW sky near Fort Worth, TX.;2014-02-25 20:00:00;15 minutes;Bright orange glow in the South West sky near Fort Worth Texas I was outside about to walk towards Wal-Mart near a hardware store and noticed a bright orange glow in the South West sky.   Iâ€™m from central California and use to forest fires and it looked like fire glowing in and out.  However there are no mountains near by and that night was overcast.  I stood there in the dark field looking at it from 7:55pm to 8pm.   I went back home and asked my girlfriend to take a look at this strange orange glow in the sky.  She came out and at that time it started to pulsated white and orange very fast.  She went inside.  I began walking very slow to store and same time looking at orange glow.  I went inside and noticed a friend of mine inside.  I asked him about glow and if it was normal in these neck of woods (knowing that a city near here called Eastland has towers of fire due to gas).  He stated it could be from neon sign near by.  I told him it could not be and it was lighting the whole south west sky.   We went outside together to recheck SW Sky.  I pointed out where it was still glowing faintly and he was VERY SHOCKED.   By the time I got home the orange glow faded out behind the clouds.   I searched the internet for any details but none was found.;32.7488;-98.9143
