It was a 90 degree V with no middle area. It was siluated against the evening sky. My estimate of its size may seem funny but, if you  could see a passenger jet low enough in the sky to have a look of being about 3 inches across its wing tip to wing tip, would be close. It made no sound and had no lights and moved very slow from southeast to northwest. It seamed to have heat wave around it like something being hot. We also saw a figure like that about 2 weeks later moving from south to north but much higher in the sky and had a goldish glow to it and probably moved over the house in about 3 seconds. Very fast and very high.I have watched and looked at photos and writings and have not ever found a picture, drawing or writing like this thing we saw. If you ask me if I belive in little green men from space, my answer is NO. But, I do believe the US is far more advanced than we will ever know. Thanks for hte time.

Craft came over on a dark but clear night.It was moving south east to north west.;1999-10-15 20:00:00;2-3min;Craft came over on a dark but clear night.It was moving south east to north west. The craft was a vee shape but not the sahpe of the new bomber. There was no, what I call the batman wing in the center. There was no sound and no lights. It looked like it had heat waves around it. If you put 2 boards end to end to form a vee, this is the shape. It drifted very slowly across the sky.I would say it was the size of a passenger plane very low to the ground. People ask how I saw it at night. I tell them if they hold something dark up to the sky at night you can see its shape. That's about the only way to describe it. Later in the month and the next month I saw the same shape very high in the sky but a goldish shape going south to north but, at a very,very fast speed. It was over my head in seconds.

It was slow moving ,no lights and totally silent and BIG.;2000-10-12 08:00:00;5 minutes;It was slow moving ,no lights and totally silent and BIG. The object seen flew over our house from the south east to the north west. Its speed was dead slow. The shape was v shaped like two boards together and making a 90 degree V shape. It was a clear night and the object was black but, it had heat waves around it. I you were to drop a 747 jet low enough to the ground to be about 2-3 inches across with a ruler held at arms length,would be thewing span, There were no lights and totally silent.
