My son and I were sitting in the back yard when we observed [what we intitially thought} to be a shooting star.  As the stream of light passed directly overhead we noticed there were 3 disks perfectly alligned and flying in formation.  The objects were stacked vertically with the top and middle disk flying slightly behind the bottom disk.  The color was amber like - not glowing but illuminated.  The objects were flying W NW at a much higher speed that a jet aircraft.  I would estimate the distance at 4000-7000 feet.  I have never believed in anything remotely related to UFO's until tonight...  I am a 54 year old business executive and my son is 11 - we both saw the same thing and the same time and both exclaimed to the other did you see that???;32.8450162244128;-97.2270036391188
