Friday, October 19, 2007 7:45 PM North Richland Hills, TX.   We were out back cleaning up on our deck when an object caught my attention.  It as a large, bright light that was shaped similar to upside down teardrop.  It was descending down until I could no longer see it.  (Below the tree tops) I called my husband and he saw the last part of it descend.  It was there for maybe 30 seconds. We then ran to our front yard and that is when we observed between 5-7 lights together, some appeared and then re appear near the same place.  The were in a cluster.  Then all started to descend directly down in a straight line again below the tree level. At that point my husband jumped into our car to get to higher ground to see them and I ran back to the backyard to see if I could see anymore.  I could not. This is what my husband saw:  As I (((name deleted))---Husband) was driving to get to higher ground in hopes of seeing the lights better I saw 1 orange light similar to a orange light on a street traffic light rise above the tree level slowly moving straight up in to the sky and then all of a sudden it went very fast up to the northeast and disappeared.;32.8450162244128;-97.2270036391188
