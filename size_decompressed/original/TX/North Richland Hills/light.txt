It was moving left across the sky very fast. Much too fast to be a plane. Planes were visible everywhere to compare the distance to the speed. The object was red with a tail at first, then slowed down eventually stopping completely. It was a steady red light, after stopping for about 15 sec it disappeared. Then the object reappeared and flew back in the direction from which it came. Nothing I know of can move that quickly, stop, and reverse itself...nothing!! I'm a little freaked out here!!!;32.8450162244128;-97.2270036391188

At 7:11 pm on July 4th my fiance and her mother and I were in the back of our house celebrating the holiday when i noticed a white light in the western sky. The light or circular object decended to the earth around the Keller Watauga area. The object emitted no smoke and did not flicker. It emmited a bright light and slowly decended toward the ground. I got my Sony Camcorder and filmed the object. at some point the object seems to change from a circle to a circle dividing like a cell and then to cone. The object was west of me, alliance airport is a few miles north west of me, and DFW airport is a few miles east of me. I will be mailing a copy of the video tape to NUFORC in several days. i would like for you guys to keep me posted on what you might or might not find out what this thing is.;32.8450162244128;-97.2270036391188

After looking at it for a few seconds it Zig zaged, then stopped then zig zagged again, and again .. It was very hard to see because it was so high, but I saw it split into two and then  go back to one.  Almost as it if shot something and it boomaganged back.   It's still ot there but it is to hard to see because it's so dim now. Almost as if it is going higher.;32.8450162244128;-97.2270036391188

We She was surprised that she could see so many stars.  We saw a plane fly by.  Then, we saw this light that was very far in the sky.  It was just a light, nothing blinking.  It was moving across the sky very smoothly at a very very high altitude.  I joked that it was the space station.  Like that it was gone.  I said it shouldn't have disappeared like that regardless of what it was.  Looked on websites for the location of the space station, and it was not in North Texas view at that time.  It was just a blip of an light, moving to the northwest.  I can tell you this thing was very very high in the sky.
