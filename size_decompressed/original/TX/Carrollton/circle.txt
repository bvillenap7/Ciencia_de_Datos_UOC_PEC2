Very distinct object (circular in shape) passed over three major suburb cities of Dallas, Tx.;1997-01-11 22:00:00;45 minutes;Very distinct object (circular in shape) passed over three major suburb cities of Dallas, Tx. I am not sure if I am remembering the date correctly, but I can verify with others who knew about it.  I was driving east on Peters Colony Rd. in Carrollton, Tx.  My wife and I saw the craft in front of us over the city of Plano.  I dropped her off at home and got my camera, then continued to follow it east on Frankford Rd.  Another driver in a truck next to my lane was also looking at it through his windshield.  It was moving south, so I turned on Kelly Rd. (southbound) to follow.  On several occasions, I considered stopping to photograph it, but could not find a good spot.  I thought it might be a blimp, but it did not change shape as it made turns.  I had to turn again, to the west, on Trinity Mills Rd. as it moved to the west.  When I finally found a place to stop to photograph it, it was out over the D/FW airport.  I was in a resturant parking lot, where a construction crew was working that night.  The Josey Ranch house was across the street from me.  I took 7 photos (4 zoomed out, 3 zoomed in with a 210 mm lens).  I showed the photos to my best friends father who was a flight controller at Lovefield Airport in Dallas and, he could not identify the object.  About six months later (after he was transfered to D/FW Airport), he told me that another flight controller was talking with him on break and he described the same object that I had photographed.  I provided one of my photographs and the flight controller did agree that it was the same object.;32.9744551063831;-96.8821161702159
Round shape, Moving slowly, changing colors.  ((NUFORC Note:  The star, Sirius??  PD));2007-04-11 23:50:00;20 min.;Round shape, Moving slowly, changing colors. I took my dogs out side to go to do their business.  While I was waiting for them, I noticed how clear the sky was. I was looking at the stars, and noticed only one was blinking. It seemed to bink in a redish greenish color. It was far off, so I went and got my feild glasses, It was moving father away from where I was standing. It was the only thing in the sky Blinking. It was not an airplane.  Looking through my feild glasses I could see it changing colors. Since it was the only thing blinking I thought that was strange. I never thought I would see something like this!;32.9744551063831;-96.8821161702159
4 circle shaped objects, very huge and bright lights over HWY 121.;2009-01-29 06:30:00;3 min;4 circle shaped objects, very huge and bright lights over HWY 121. To whom it may concern: 1/29/09    Dear Sir/Madam  This morning Tuesday 1/29/09, I left my house at about 6:00 to go to work.  It was very foggy day but not so bad on HWY 121.   I was heading south toward Southlake and as I got to Spring Creek Pkwy, I notice a circle shaped object with lots of lights on top of HWY 121. (about 6:30 am )  I thought that I was seeing things but right after that another one following each other was traveling very slowly like they were observing.   Not too many cars on the road but very few cars that were traveling in my direction were braking to watch.  It was impossible to stop so I then stopped in the nearest station and called the non-emergency police 972 941-2142.  They advised me to call FAA ( 206 722-3000 ), which I did and got a voice mail of Mr. Davenport is full.  I called the police back and they told me that was the only number they had and for me to report and also fill out form on line at www.ufocenter.com  I saw total of 4 circle shape objects traveling slowly above HWY 121 with very bright lights perhaps 14-16 big round lights. Thanks much.;32.9744551063831;-96.8821161702159
