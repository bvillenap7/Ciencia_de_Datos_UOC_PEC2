Cigar metallic object traveling north at an incredible rate of speed for 20 seconds I was driving north on I 35 when I glanced up and saw a cigar shaped metallic object with three seperating markings running cross ways on it. It had no wings and was about 50 yards away following north also.  There was a plane between my car and the object and I noticed the plane was gaining on me slowly.  I kept glancing up and the object was going very fast.  It was a clear, sunny day and it was out of site in maybe 10 seconds.  My nine year old granddaughter asked me what that was and I asked her what just to see what she would say and she said,Not the plane, that other thing.  I told her I did not know and she asked me if it was a UFO and I just repeated that I did not know.  I didn't want to scare her.;32.9744551063831;-96.8821161702159
