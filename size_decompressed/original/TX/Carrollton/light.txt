Me and some friends were sitting outside on my balcony when we witnessed odd lights flashing and moving quicky across the sky. Some would even move straight upwards, as if levitating directly above them.  Sometimes one light would flash for a second then five more lights would appear in a line on the sides of it, all flashing. Then they would all go out at the same time. The lights were all white or had a blueish tint to them. Not too out of the ordinary. But their movements and stationary positions then disappearing is unlike any other aircraft I have ever been familiar with. They were probably about 3-4 miles away and about 1000 feet off the ground I suppose. I live on the third story and my balcony is pointed towards the South of Carrollton, TX;32.9744551063831;-96.8821161702159
Bright pin point light moving extremely slow at High Altitude;2007-09-27 14:30:00;6minutes;Bright pin point light moving extremely slow at High Altitude Ok the object was very bright and small because it so high up I thought it was a balloon. It was drifting slowly near the clouds, my buddy who is an ex-pilot notice it also he confirmed that it wasn’t a plane because it was really high up.  After about 2 minutes it started moving towards the sun. it seems like it knew that the clouds would not provide cover so it started zig zagging where the clouds were. Until it made under the sun and could no longer view it. It was not the space station I’ve seen it before, nor was it a satellite or airplane because it didn’t have anything sticking out of the sides plus there were airplanes moving about.;32.9744551063831;-96.8821161702159
A series of lights in a tight formation that had to be several miles long;2014-05-01 22:40:00;15 minutes;A series of lights in a tight formation that had to be several miles long On the evening of May 1st, approximately 10:30 in the evening, my wife and I heard a humming sound possibly a weird sounding helicopter that sounded like it was coming towards the house, when it suddenly stopped.  We were in bed watching TV when my wife asked me to check, looking out the window in a nw direction I noticed a series of lights which appeared to be in a straight line. At first I thought the first few lights might be part of a few planes following each other in formation.  But after seeing the 5 and 6 light I asked my wife to follow me she needed to see this.  I ran downstairs and went into the back yard (I couldn’t go out front I was in my underwear).  When I was out back I noticed the lights headed towards Lewisville.  It was several miles long and all of the lights were on when the lights began to turn on and off randomly.  There were about 60 perhaps 100 lights that seemed to be in a straight line in a tight formation.  I couldn’t make out a shape, depth or height as the lights were partly obscured by clouds. As the lights began to alternate off and on they suddenly turned off.  Then they appeared again to our left several miles away and in a straight line but in a vertical pattern instead of horizontal.  The lights moved down towards the horizon when it looked like it might touch down the lights began to flash white and red this time.  Then all of the lights turned off and about 5 seconds later we saw red lights in the form a triangle pattern just to the right of where the horizontal line had been.  The lights flashed off and on in red and possibly yellow for 1 or 2 minutes then stopped.  We waited about 10 – 15 minutes then went back inside.   Afterwards my wife noticed aircraft going in the same direction of the lights.;32.9744551063831;-96.8821161702159
