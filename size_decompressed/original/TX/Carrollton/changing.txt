While watching the Leonids, my son (14) and I saw an object aproximately 4 times Jupiters diameter cross from east to west in a somewhat irregular motion. Time from initial discovery to loss of visual contact was about 20 seconds. The object had a strange sort of movement that I think can best be described as a jerky, low frame rate film with maybe 1/30 second gaps between movements. The color shifted from gold to brown to orange. The overall effect was a muddy orange coloration. The objects direction was straight at first, almost like a satelite's but traveling at about 2 1/2 times faster across the sky than a satelite would normally be seen travelling. The object turned slightly south east for the last five seconds that it was seen. The object slightly dimmed after the small change in direction for about two seconds. It then turned SSE for no more than probably 1/4 second and instantly vanished completely. During the first five seconds or so, I was looking at the object with my naked eye. For the next maybe 15 seconds, I followed the object with my 15 x 70 astronomical binoculars. Visually the object looked like a dim but larger than Jupiter object with light intensity changing +/- by as much as 1/3. When seen through my binoculars, it had a totally different look. Through the binoculars the object looked like a giant autumn leaf flying through the air as though alive. Again, while seen through the binoculars, the object had a beatifully fluid although slow frame rate movement. I say fluid because the frame rate of the movements remained pretty consistent. I am a serious amateur astronomer and spend about 8 hrs a week observing. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded credible, and we believe he probably is an exceptional eyewitness.  Please see other reports for this date.

We watched it until we could no longer see it.  My sister thought it was a weather balloon, but I did not. It went down in a straight line, but it looked like it was tumbling, and it looked metallic.;32.9744551063831;-96.8821161702159
