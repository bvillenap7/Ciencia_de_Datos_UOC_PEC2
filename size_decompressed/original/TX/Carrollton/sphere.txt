3 Orange Spheres moving West to East over Carrollton TX.;2007-12-31 21:38:00;2 minutes;3 Orange Spheres moving West to East over Carrollton TX. I had just turned South off of Frankford Rd. onto Scott Mill Rd. when out of the corner of my right eye I caught a glimpse of something out of the ordinary.  Three round fire orange spheres were moving (at a seemingly slow pace) from the Northwest to the Southeast.  These spheres appeared to be about a thousand feet above my vehicle.  As I continued southbound down the road I noticed several people looking towards the sky, so I assume there were other witnesses.  When I returned back travelling north up Scott Mill the lights were gone.  They were only visible (to me) for a few short minutes - maybe three or four.  I've seen plenty of airplane lights and stars and these were definitely not either of those.  WEIRD!;32.9744551063831;-96.8821161702159
Ufo seen around a gigantic trail of cloud phenomenon;2011-04-12 12:30:00;several days;Ufo seen around a gigantic trail of cloud phenomenon UFO April 2011 REPORT New Evidence   The UFO(s) in question occurred in Carrollton, Texas, USA. Some pictures and ground up, live video of the recent cloud phenomena are captured using a 14.1mp digital camera/video.  A day after the event in question, several USAF reconnaissance flight over the area in Carrollton, Texas witnessed.  Following this event,  a severe thunderstorm and hail storm reported including a massive forest/county fire report, culminating with ~200 tornado touchdowns. Recent weather, doppler /radar report showed a gigantic trail of concentrated thunderstorm cloud strip expanding toward the northern territories of the United States, dissipating out toward the Atlantic ocean. The captured scenes show a huge steak or trail of cloud expanding toward the northern territory, hundreds of miles and miles. Midst of these strange cloud phenomena, there are some unique “image” or unidentifiable flying objects.  In particular, an object near over my head in the sky, an object bigger or as big as the sun, is clearly visible on the digital video. After reviewing the video several times, I personally concluded that there exists more than one UFO because there are some obscure objects with shaded geometrical shapes and lines  in/around the huge streak of cloud against bluish sky background. The  pictures and videos of April/2011 UFO(s) consist of:  Several pictures during a sunset following a strange cloud formation  Some night videos of flying “star” alike object followed by a close footage of our airplane flying by  this shows the depth and distance of these objects. •	Several daylight videos of this gigantic trail of strange cloud with UFO’s This report will be my first formal written UFO sightings report. The initial report/inquiry was to a Physics professor at the University of North Texas.  Here some sample evidence in photographs:         There are more     FYI: due to an unknown  PC hackling” activities in this terminal,  I’ve turned  current pictures and videos into a corporate property , as I record and upload these videos through this particular computer.

White in color with a white tail sperical shape.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a high-altitude a/c, with a contrail behind it?  PD));2016-10-21 12:40:00;2-3 minutes;White in color with a white tail sperical shape This was not a space craft or a plane.  It looked like a comet with a tail that expanded out from the ball.  It was visible in the southern sky for 2 to 3 minutes over the Dallas, Texas, area.  It eventually went out of site. I sent this message to a local TV station but did not get a response. Around 12:40 to 12:45PM today, I saw what looked like a Meteor or Comet in the southern sky.  It was visible for 2 to 3 minutes.  Do you all know what it was?  It defiantly was not a plane. Do you know what this was? Thank You, Jeff PS I have seen the space shuttle come over our area 2 times.  The smoke trail that it left was visible in the sky for several minutes.  The object I saw yesterday tail diapered a few seconds after it had reached any certain point in the sky.  The farther it went the less of the tail I saw.  Eventually as went went farther away you could just see a round light.  I would think that it was very high or in a high orbit.  It may have been a meteor but all the falling stars that I have seen only last a second or 2. I think it was some kind of a celestial body and not a spacecraft of some kind.  I really would like to know what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a high-altitude a/c, with a contrail behind it?  PD));32.9744551063831;-96.8821161702159
