While looking at the moon through my 6 in refractor telescope, an object about the size of a large moon crater passed from the northern pole of the moon to the southern pole of the moon. The object cast a shadow on the moon that was only about 10% larger than the object itself. The duration from north to south pole was only about 2.5 to 3 seconds. The object itself was ink black with no detail other than this visible. The previously mentioned shadow cast by the object was semi transparent and surface detail of the moon was clearly visible though it. The object itself was jet black.;32.9744551063831;-96.8821161702159
