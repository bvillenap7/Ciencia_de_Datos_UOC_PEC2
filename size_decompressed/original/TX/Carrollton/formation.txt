As I watched it I saw A formation of what looked to be birds but shown bright gold and moving fast. I was at work when I headed out to do my midnight samples. I was moving west on my plant when I noticed something that looked like a mist or a cloud but moving. It was heading south to north at a pretty good pace.  From where I work you can see the planes taking off at DFW airport. It seemed to be coming from that area.   As I watched this whatever it was coming across in front of me I saw that it angled to the east toward me then back north.  I would say it was maybe a half mile away when I got a good look at it.   The mist or cloud turn toward me one more time showing me what looked to be a flock of birds but was not.  They flew in formation there 12 to 14 bright gold objects. It was still to far to tell the shapes for sure.  Also it was almost midnight.  The sky was clear and a good moon shown bright.  They were not very high up either I figure no more then 100 feet not much more.  As they turned back west it was as if they became the mist or cloud again.  I could still see the movement for another minute or so then lost it as I moved to get a better angle on it.  I thought about letting you know sooner but was not sure till I heard you on Art Bell talking to the to ladies about almost the same thing I saw except the mist or cloud.   That is the what I saw that night.;32.9744551063831;-96.8821161702159
