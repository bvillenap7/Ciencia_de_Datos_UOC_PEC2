Westside of Corpus Christi UFO;1988-07-15 22:00:00;2 min;West side of Corpus Christi UFO I am 29yr old now and I estimate this even occurred sometime between '88-'89.  My brother and I were inside our house watching t.v. and my dad was out in the front yard smoking a cig one night.  My dad opens the front door and yells LOOK!.  Well my bro and I run outside and my dad is in the middle of the yard staring at the sky.  We look up and there is this round object flying extremely low and what seemed slow...so low its scary..but yet we dont say a word to each other nor do we run away...we can't help but just stand there in awe and stare as this object is about to fly over our heads...its the size of a house and it has small white round lights around the perimeter.   It is not making a sound and its about 10pm so no one is outside yelling or making a commotion..matter of fact, if you werent looking in the sky it would have flown right over your head without you ever knowing. It flew directly over our head and now that im older i can say that it was probably about 300ft. above us...it cleared some power lines but was so low i remember thinking to my self its gonna hit the power lines.  It also flew what i would consider slow...about 30mph. I know SOMEONE else HAD to have seen it around the area as we live in a residential neighborhood in the city.  We didnt have a camcorder or camera back then and i know that now thats the first thing i would grab if i ever saw it again.  I remember telling everyone but back then no one seemed to care so i just kinda buried the memories and it was begining to feel like i dreamt that night because i dont talk to my dad anymore and my bro never brought it up but my wife asked me if i ever thought i'd seen a ufo so i asked my bro if he remembered that night and he confirms my story.   His account is exactly the same except he says he remembers shortly afterwards black helicopters were flying around the area because my dad pointed them out (he was a helicopter mechanic back then).  My bro is 3 years younger so i guess i would have been about 10 or 11 and he was! 7 or 8 when this happened.  Oh yeah...i know the object was round because when it flew over us, you could see this massive round black silouette in the dark sky and the perimeter lights were not beams but rather dull yellow white lights.   IF ANYONE REMEMBERS SEEING SOMETHING SIMILAR PLEASE POST! this occured in the 80's on the west side of corpus christi near prescott and gollihar.

perfectly round object w/lights around perimeter,  large one in cent., made a  hoovering sound, lights glowed white to yellow to orang;1995-06-30 18:00:00;1-2minutes;perfectly round object w/lights around perimeter,  large one in cent., made a  hoovering sound, lights glowed white to yellow to orang San Antonio Texas The Object Was Huge   Date: 1995  Time: 6:00 p.m. (dusk)   Location of Sighting: Water Gardens in Corpus Christi above the Harbor Bridge.  Number of witnesses: 5  Number of objects: 1  Shape of objects: Perfectly Round with lights around perimeter, and one big light in the center.   Full Description of event/sighting: Well anyway me and my wife are down at the Water Gardens and I am telling her all about this boy and the pictures, and just feeding her with all this info...(witness was referring to a MUFON meeting he attended) well she finally says look!  I will listen to you and all that but don't push this stuff on me... I have to see to believe, at that moment I made a request to them (aliens I guess) I wish they would come down right now so you can see them and believe in them. Like I do.  Well at that moment in conversation I told her in Spanish... look in the sky. Here comes a car.   There were two lights directly above the Harbor Bridge like back behind it a little . She laughed and we just kept talking thinking the whole time it was probably a plane or something.  Well for some reason I was watching it in the corner of my eye, and then realized like in no time it was directly above us. At this point my wife was starting to freak, and I was so full of excitement that this was happening.  I remember looking up and this object was huge, and made no sound... that was scary ...something that big floating above us and all you could here was a hovering noise..a very faint hovering noise... not loud at all...  The lights glowed from white to yellow to green and then the reverse.  The object then moved directly behind the Art Building, came to a perfect stop and made a 90 degree turn around the corner of the building going beyond our sight... I was trying to run to the other side of the building and my wife was pulling on my hand.She did not want me to go because she was scared... I finally broke loose and ran around the building only to see the object blink out.  It jumped from near the art building to about 1 or 2 miles out above the bay and then just blinked out again and disappeared.  My wife to this day does not like talking about this incident.... She is old school.. you know every thing has to have an explanation. Thank you to the witness for this report. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Three UFO's were spotted by six people in the middle of Corpus Christi, Texas.;2010-07-21 19:00:00;1 minuet;Three UFO's were spotted by six people in the middle of Corpus Christi, Texas. Me and my two friends were sitting on the curb of my house at sunset.  There were absolutely no clouds just a peek of sun and an outline of the moon.  We saw just about three circular space crafts just come out from behind the moon.  It was flashing three huge lights that changed from green to blue.As soon as we noticed the UFO our neighbor was unable to start his car. We immediately called my mom my brother and my grandma to see.  They said it was a UFO and ran to get there cameras.  The craft was completely visible but wasn't able to be captured on camera.  Halfway across the sky the crafts just disappeared into space.  We tried calling the local radio station but of course they didn't believe us.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
