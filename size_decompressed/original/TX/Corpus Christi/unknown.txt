I decided to go jogging at a local High school track on 11/01/09 at about 6:30PM. I jogged and walked the track until about 7:45 PM. I decided to lay down and stretch before going home. It was a cool and clear night and cool night with a bright full moon. I laid down on my back to stretch and was looking up at the sky noticing how clear and pretty it was. I noticed 3 stars in a triangle pattern that stood out from the rest, nothing seemed unusual about that. But as I was just gazing up at them  I noticed 1 of the stars or what appeared to be a star start moving to the right. It started moving very slowly, so slow in fact I thought my eye’s were not focusing well or it was just me. But I then noticed the bright star to the right of the object (a planet more than likely because it was so bright) was staying stationary. NO other stars were moving. The object moved very slowly, I then started looking for blinking lights thinking maybe it was a plane coming in at an angle and then turning or something. But as it moved very slowly to the right it slowly started to fade out. And it then disappeared. I viewed it for at least 45 seconds. I thought of everything it could be because I am a skeptic.  At first I thought maybe it was the space station, but I ruled that out because I have seen the space station before and you can see it from start to finish and it moves much faster than this object was moving.  We have a Navy base that trains pilots in single engine prop planes and I seen three right after this sighting and they all had blinking lights and even at the slow speed they travel they still traveled faster than this object. I ruled out everything, even space junk. Because when I started looking up all 3 stars were not moving. Then one of them started to move very slowly to the right and flickered as it faded out. It just vanished in the night sky. I heard no noise, because when it flickered out I thought it might be an after burner on a jet. I have not other explanation other than it was a UFO. Note: I live in the city where the lights are bright and you can’t see most of the stars. But this object was as bright as the Planet to the right of it. If someone was not paying attention they would have not noticed this object moving because it was moving so slow.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
Object moving at speeds 5 to 6 times faster than satellite.;2014-07-25 21:15:00;5 seconds;Object moving at speeds 5 to 6 times faster than satellite. Sitting on back deck looking at the stars and saw an object which was coming out of the west at an extremely high rate of speed.  There was no noise or trail and the object vanished off the horizon within 5 to 6 seconds.  We were looking for satellites, and saw several, one prior to the event and two after the event.  This object was traveling at 4 to 5 times the speed of a satellite.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
Silvery black uncertain shape in sky.;2015-09-11 22:45:00;20 seconds;Silvery black uncertain shape in sky. I was sitting on the porch looking at the sky listening to the chirping frogs and rain dripping off of the roof.  Then I hear a plane and it flies over our house extremely low to the ground. I look at the plane for a while and it flies off and then turns to the right and goes away. Then I see what at first I think is a herd of birds all together but there isn't any space between them and they are in a triangular shape with one edge pointing down and flat at the top but it seems to turn and so I think it is maybe a large eagle.  It is dark and hazy so it is hard to see so I get up and start walking closer and it seems to be a shiny gray or silvery black color and starts to look like a disk.  I am now in the street getting my socks all wet running to try to get a better look as the house across the street's trees are blocking and when I get around both houses in the street, it is gone and I don't see it anymore. I was guessing it could be a drone but it seemed much too big to be a drone and just seemed like some sort of craft possibly surveying the area. Another possibility is a cloud but it was much more defined, seemed too small to be a cloud, and there weren't any other low clouds (this thing was probably half the distance off the ground that the low plane was). No one else was outside in our neighborhood and I thought about running inside to tell my mom and brother to come out but it happened too fast.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
