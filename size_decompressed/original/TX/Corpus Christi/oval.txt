Strange lights outside of bedroom window, little aliens.;1970-10-30 03:00:00;10 minutes;strange lights outside of bedroom window, little aliens Extra-terrestrial Contact 3rd event: In the summer of 1970, August 3rd, Corpus Christi was devastated by hurricane Celia.  It wiped out the city, martial law was imposed, the National Guard shot and killed 9 looters over the course of the next two months.   We were without power or electricity until mid-October of that year.  Soon after power was restored, one night in my outside my bedroom window, late at night, a very bright red and blue light appeared in backyard.  The lights moved up and down through a very heavily branched cedar tree.  I didnâ€™t get up out of bed because I was way too scared to see.  Later that night, I woke up and I am not sure if I was hallucinating and seeing small little people with big fat heads and very big eyes in room looking around.   I put the covers over my head and wished that they would go away.  Nothing else happened then I fell asleep. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 1970 is approximate.

UFO experience when I was young in Corpus Christi, Tx;1997-07-30 01:00:00;5 minutes;UFO experience when I was young in Corpus Christi, Tx When I was 12, my friend and I would spend most of our summer vacation hanging out in the neighborhood. We lived on 16th street near where 16th st. intersected Morgan Street and about half a mile from Cole Park on the bay. One day my friend's cousin had visited him during the afternoon and was going to stay the night. So we decided to spend the rest of the day hanging out and when nightfall approached. We decided to show him our late night hang out spot which was an abandoned house next to my friend's house. The abandoned house had a 2nd story patio that could be reached by stairs and from there we could easily jump on the roof. We would hang out on the rooftop there late at night since we did not have school and it was okay with our parents. We would look up at the stars and talk about anything. We'll that night around 1:00am, we decided to go to our hang out spot on the abandoned house rooftop. The rooftop was in the shape of an L and it was not flat but slanted on each side. I was sitting down on the long side of the L shaped roof facing to the North . While my friend and his cousin sat on the short side of the L shaped roof facing West. We were there for about an hour talking about something when all of a sudden I noticed something stranged. As I was looking at my friends I noticed a bright white light appear around us. I was shocked since it was 1:00am and there was no moon visible in the night sky. As I looked up to see the source of this light. I saw a white bright glowing object hovering about 15ft in the air near the end of the of the L shaped roof near my friends and about the size of a small car. This object did not have propellers, wings, or any insignia that may have confirmed it was a commercial or military craft. All of sudden it ceased its hovering position and began to move toward us. Afraid and shocked at what I was seeing I immediatly got up and made a mad dash to the patio and my friends followed suit. As we made our frantic run from the object I looked back at the ob! ject onc e I reached the ground but it was gone. As we reached my friend's house. We were all shivering from fear and we could not come to a conclusion to what we saw. Since then we have kept the incident to ourselves for about 9 years.  A while back I visited my friend, since we have all moved from our original neighborhood, to finally bring this incident to light for us. He was relunctant and wants to forget the incident but from his viewpoint he agreed to settle the matter. He remembers seeing a scared reaction on my face and when he looked to see what was the matter. He said the object was approaching and instantly he and his cousin ran as fast as they could. While on the patio he turned to see the object. He said he saw the object zig zagging back and forth into the sky then disappearing leaving a metallic streak. A while back I saw the documentary about UFO phenomena with Peter Jennings on the National Geographic Channel and heard about the UFO Center. I felt I should tell the center of my experience and maybe someone else around that area may have reported the same object.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065

Three circular outlines made of red lights two drifted away in different directions, one lingered and then left.;2009-10-31 22:00:00;2 minutes;Three circular outlines made of red lights two drifted away in different directions, one lingered and then left. Background: There were seven of us at my house meeting up before we went to a Halloween party. We took pictures inside, gathered our belongings, and stepped outside to enter our cars. The second we stepped out onto the porch we saw lights hovering. I tried asking a news station if anyone else had seen what we did, yet I never got a response. What we saw: There were three distinct oval shapes made of circular red lights in the sky in front of us they were already there when we walked out. Two of them drifted away, in opposite directions, out of sight within thirty seconds. The last one lingered for what seemed like forty five extra seconds, and then SLOWLY drifted away out of sight. We were amazed and in awe. Background of observers: We're all students here in Corpus aged 20-22. I said there were seven of us present but I can't remember any reaction from one of our friends, which is why I stated only six of us saw. No photos: The thought came up but I had mentioned that my camera wouldn't get lights from that far away (Since it wouldnt have) and instead we just wacthed until they left.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
I saw a black oval in the sky surrounded by a streaming light.;2011-09-20 03:20:00;2 mins;I saw a black oval in the sky surrounded by a streaming light. I was picking up my son from a baby sitter at around 3:20 am.  While i was waiting i looked up into the sky. I noticed a large stream of light drop at an left angle from where i was standing.  It was so unusual to me because it only started to shoot down halfway through the atmosphere, and the light was 10 times wider than any shooting star i've ever witnessed.  As the object dropped closer toward me i began to panic and tried to open my car as quickly as possible to retrieve my phone which was completely dead. I did not attempt to turn on my car during the sighting for fear of attracting attention to myself although it seemed as if i were being pulled toward the object regardless.  I noticed as the object was dropping it had a tail behind it about 7-8 inches long but as it came closer to the surface the light seemed to collapse into it once it came close enough to drop lower than the treeline.  At the closest the object Seemed to be about 3-4 inches long and 2 wide so it looked like a huge black oval in the sky surrounded by a white light that looked the same color as clouds.  The white light showed through the center of the oval as well so it seemed like an object projected by light until it reached the tree line, then the light seemed to drop into the blackness and disappear all together. The other thing i remembered noticing was the lack of noise.  There was no sign the it ever hit the ground but i felt an overwhelming urgency to drive in the direction of where i had last seen it fall.  I felt as if it were less than 5 miles away, but i chose not to go because i needed to take my toddler home.  I have yet to get over the shock, and am still noticing unusual movement in the skies after 3 am.  I can try to send a drawing depicting what i saw, but i was never able to make out the object in full.  It did not seem to stop moving, and it feels like once it got close enough to see my mind wiped any other images than the black oval which in itself is amazing because i suppose it means the object was mo! ving faster than light itself.

Color-changing slanted oval in the night sky.;2013-06-08 22:20:00;2 minutes;Color-changing slanted oval in the night sky Driving home, my mother and I saw a slanted oval in the sky.  The oval appeared to be entirely stationary, and it was rapidly changing colors in a cycle, we examined it for about 30 seconds, then passed into an area with taller buildings.  When we emerged from the buildings, we looked again, and the oval was no longer changing colors, but was solid blue.  When we arrived home, we went into the front yard to look some more, but the oval was gone.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
Green oval orb seen flying over baseball field.;2015-09-03 20:30:00;5 seconds;Green oval orb seen flying over baseball field. While at the baseball game, I had glanced up since I noticed a bright light.  It looked rather oval shaped, from what I remember, and it was green with a small orange tail behind it, possibly the part propelling it with fire like a rocket.  I only saw it for a few seconds when it zoomed by and then disappeared, but I remember someone else had pointed up at it when it was still visible.   I figured it was best to report it just in case.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
