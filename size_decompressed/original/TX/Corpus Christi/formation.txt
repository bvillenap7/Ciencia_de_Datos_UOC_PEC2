they were like stars at night but only this was during the day time.;2006-07-08 04:45:00;2 houra;they were like stars at night but only this was during the day time. it's wierd because i've seen satelites in the sky and i know that they only go in the same direction. but these stars were hoovering then they would move. it was not small movement but lets say one would be circling the other's then it would go back to the spot that it was seen in the first time.i could only see what the naked eye could see. it's hard to belive but this saturday july 15,2006 they were seen again. but only three off them. this time the bigger star was the the one doing the moving.we were going to get another person to see this but by the time the got to our house the sky was blanketed with clouds..the were coming from the south and i guess the went back the same way. i'll tell you what i could not believe it. to see something like that make you ask questions.

Bright multicolored light over corpus christi bay area.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-06 05:52:00;1-2 minutes;Bright multicolored light over corpus christi bay area. Coming home from work, looking toward the bay and noticed a 45 degree angle perfect line of 20 or so rainbow spectrum lights (brilliantly beautiful!) that were quickly changing color and going from dull to bright and fading away leaving a grayish remnant silouette in its place when the lights faded into the dark sky.  This lasted 1-2 minutes, didnt have phone ready to capture and i didnt want to look away.  I really hope others hadbseen it as well, it was an awesome sight!;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
32 objects over the south Texas sky.  ((Spacelink satellites));2020-03-08 06:15:00;45 minutes;32 obects over the south Texas sky. From our view point 32 objects traveled from the ne towards the sw around 0615-0730. The objects spanned a 3-5 degree arc.  All traveled the same direction and speed.  As a retired Navy controller, I never seen any A/C traveling this high in a straight row.  No warning lights!  The night sky was bright with a full moon, the objects reflected nicely.  We could predict the next viewing based on the objects being equally spaced. incredible show this morning!;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
two sightings in less than four days;2020-05-01 02:30:00;2 minutes;two sightings in less than four days I see them more frequently now than ever as a avid night sky watcher .  I know what birds migrating at night look like, I know what a plane with it’s landing lights looks like, I know what a meteor or a falling star looks like, & this sighting was 100% genuinely two craft coming down silently into our atmosphere or one large chevron craft with only two of its white spherical lights on underneath.  They both moved diagonal down left across a clear starry night sky without a sound.  Almost as if two stars decided to change their position in a still star lit night sky. .   While watching the 2min duration of them descending the lead craft and or first light fizzled in & out then went dark.  The second object or light followed same course then fizzled out when it arrived at same point as first.  Truly remarkable. I had seen a orange spherical object three days prior to this incident so wasn’t shocked that they came back around for a second visit. I have really good video of a daytime sighting as well.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
