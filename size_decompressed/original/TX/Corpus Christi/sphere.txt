The shape inside was like or was a medical symbol. It hovered outside in the back of my yard for a few days. There seemed to be a power associated with it, also. It was as if it was a supernatural thing that could change everything all at once. It gave me a considerable heaviness in my head as I looked upon it. Following this, I could see that I, myself, developed certain abilities that created change. The effects were amazing. It drifted across the street and hung over another house. It was as if I were in a science fiction movie. This has changed me. I went to the neighbors across the street and they said they thought it was an advertising blimp. It was clear, though. There were no words on it. The object moved outside of any noticeable motor or force. It appeared to be approximately 15 feet up in the sky. It looked to be near a yard in diameter. I'm not a drug user and I don't drink. There is more to this than I'm indicating here. Events changed after that and the city surroundings took on a change for a period of time.

12/17/07 Corpus Christi Tx Orange ball light comming at me 8 to 900mph when I shinned LED light at it.;2007-12-17 05:00:00;2 to 3 hours;12/17/07 Corpus Christi Tx Orange ball light comming at me 8 to 900mph when I shinned LED light at it. Im at the beach in my car about 1 mile from bob hall pier, when I see a non moving orange light far out over the gulf of mexico. The distance about 30 to 40 miles away from me, and the light was 3 to 4 feet above the water.  I am  starring at it thinking it was an oil rig light, when I thought I saw it move a little bit. I decided to shine my bright LED Light at it and got its attention, and boy did I.  It started coming at me fast about 8 to 9 hundred mph. I was scared, but my curiosity got the best of me. It took 1 full minute to stop 30 yards in front of me in my car.  I had my car window down with my arm out the window and kept shining my led light at this no sound at all, the size of my fist orange ball of pulsating light playing with it for 2 or 3 hours.  It was frozen still staring at me, and moveing left to fight up and down.  I tryed to get closer to it by chasing it down the beach, but it would'nt let me get any closer than 30 yards.  It just kept the same distance when I was moving or not moving.  It stayed with me untill sunrise and slowly moved away 3 feet obove the water and faded away.   I've also seen in 10/29/2008 another dark orange submersible ball light in another area moving squiggly fast under 2 feet of water in the bay very simuler to my first sighting.  They are real.  I can take you to see for your self, I got 3 hot spots.  Im an honest person and I will take a lie detecter test.  If you have any questions you can call me.

Four of us saw a pulsing white sphere in the sky in our backyard.;2012-09-11 02:00:00;5 minutes;Four of us saw a pulsing white sphere in the sky in our backyard. My husband and I as well as another couple noticed a strange object flying in the sky.  We were all in our backyard talking and relaxing as we noticed the star-like object moving in the sky. As we all  were keeping our eyes on it there was no sound.  It looked as if it was an ordinary star in the sky.  The night was clear and stars were visible.  It was a sphere shape and pulsing white light emitted from it. After the first few minutes the pulsing started to get brighter. Then it started to move getting higher in the atmosphere and leaving altogether. Almost shooting with great speed out into space. It left us confused and baffled after witnessing this object's strange movements then leaving altogether without a sound. It only lasted for about 5 minutes. ;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
Bright Red Orange Sphere Gliding at Tree Level;2013-12-01 20:00:00;1 minute;Bright Red Orange Sphere Gliding at Tree Level It was 8 pm, I was in my car driving down a usually busy city street that's in between two major intersections.  But at this time, it was late on a Sunday evening.  My husband was following directly behind me in his car.  There were few cars on the street along with us at this time.  This short stretch of neighborhood area has few street lights.  An object caught my eye on the right side of the street.  It was a bright/glowing red orange object that was gliding at tree level.  It crossed our path.  I got to witness it up close as it crossed right in front of me.  The only way I can describe it, is that looking out my windshield from inside, it was about the size of a large car.  The object was glowing red from within and had a bright colorful haze around it.  It seemed to be in the shape of a tear drop sphere but it was so bright.  I would've gotten a good recording if I had had my phone out.  I slowed down and rolled my window down so that I could point out! the object to my husband. It made no sound as it glided straight across.  I pulled over to the first parking lot I found and I was able to watch it until it disappeared.  This definitely is a populated area that I witnessed it in.  It was coming from an area that is somewhat isolated but going towards the highly populated area.  It was not a fireball with a tail and it was not falling from the sky.  It was gliding across the sky at a low level and moderate speed.  I only saw one object but I kept looking around to see if I could see anything else.  When I got home, my husband confirmed that he too had seen the object.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
