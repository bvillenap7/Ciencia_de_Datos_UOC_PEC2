Ufo sighted by ExprssJet Piots and confirmed by the crew of another ExpressJet.;2007-03-14 22:25:00;apx. 10-15 minutes;Ufo sighted by ExprssJet Piots and confirmed by the crew of another ExpressJet. On Wednesday March 14, 2007 at approximately 22:25 CDT, I was working a High altitude sector.  I am an air traffic controller.   The crew of an Express Jet Embrair Jet asked if I showed any traffic at their 2 oâ€™clock position and about 40 miles.  I did not and told them so.  I then asked for a description.   They reported the object to have reddish light with some white.  At about the same time the crew of another Express Jet confirmed the sighting.   The first aircraft was about 50 miles east of Corpus Christi, TX, southbound at 36,000feet.  The other aircraft was 60 miles in front of the first aircraft heading the same direction and at the same altitude.  I then got a strong primary radar return at the reported object position for about 12 to 20 seconds, which then disappeared.  The first aircraft then noticed the object descending and then moving off to the west at high speed.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065

I am very familiar with the flight patterns and wind directions. This light was traveling in a direction and in the air space between the Corpus Christi International Airport and the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station. There was no sound and no flashing lights of any color. This light passed directly over Ingelside. This occurred in the evening at 18:25 hours on December 1st 2007 for a duration of approxamitley one minute.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065

bright light over Corpus Christi, Texas takes 90 degree evasive action when Navy plane approaches & disappears.;2008-08-08 22:00:00;15 minutes;bright light over Corpus Christi, Texas takes 90 degree evasive action when Navy plane approaches & disappears On Friday, 08-08-08, my wife and I were fishing in Corpus Christi, Texas near the Naval Air Station.  We were on Padre Island fishing the canals off of Whitecap Rd.   It was about 10:00 P. M. when we noticed a bright light coming towards us out of the western clear night sky. The light seemed to be hovering or floating as it moved slightly side to side as it moved forward. There was absolutely no sound coming from it and we both waited to hear jet engines or a helicopter noise.  Then, as we watched intenly a Navy trainer flew over head and seemed to fly directly towards the hovering light.  As we watched, the light or flying machine took evasive action and did a 90 degree maneuver flying straight up into the clear night sky.  We watched the light ascend into the deep blue space until it disappeared.   This was no ordinary flying machine, but I have no doubt it was some kind of advanced flying machine.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
Lights in the Sky;2011-01-05 19:15:00;30 seconds;Lights in the Sky Standing on a balcony on the twelth floor, looking out towards the north, I saw an airplane flying toward the naval air base. As the plane was flying toward the base, I notice another  aircraft nearby. The aircraft did not emit any sound, nor any beams of any sort, instead it was moving around in the same proximity the airplane was at. The  aircraft had red lights that blink on the top,                                                      and white lights at the bottom that did not blink. I notice that this object was not moving as the same speed the airplane was at, instead it was moving in a fluid/ sort of jagged like motion. As the airplane was coming closer to the building i was in, the  aircraft continune to resum remaining in a same area, the speed it was  hovering was not as fast as compare to the plane, instead it was moving at a slower pace. The lights continue to blick, as the airplane pass the building i was in. I took my eyes off the  aircraft for a couple of seconds. When i look back, the  aircraft was gone, I continue to lok again for this  aircraft but I had no luck,. It was nowhere to be seen.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
White light moving randomly in Corpus Christi sky.;2011-02-07 19:04:00;8 Seconds;White light moving randomly in Corpus Christi sky. Standing in my backyard, located in the south-side of Corpus Christi, I spotted what appeared to be a star at first glance.  After a second of staring I noticed that it started to slowly move eastward.  After a good 3 seconds the objects movement dramatically change.  This white light rapidly did a half figure eight pattern swooping down a good range in the sky.  Now, after the object disappeared from my view, I noticed that there were three helicopters flying in the sky also.  It is unusual to see helicopters in Corpus Christi unless you are on the beach.  We are use to seeing planes here, so the difference can be distinguished easily. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Was twinkling like a star but had slight red glow to it.   Within about 1 to 1 and a half mins, it gradually diminished until it disappeared from view.   Almost immediately afterwards, saw a much larger, round bright orange light slowly rising in an arc towards where previous light had been.   When it reached the same spot, it stopped and slowly turned into the twinkling light we first noticed and, again, slowly begin to diminish and disappear.   Waited about 15 mins but never saw anything else.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
