4 glowing fire like spheres in the sky.;2014-07-05 21:30:00;10 minutes;4 glowing fire like spheres in the sky. My wife and I were sitting on front porch enjoying the cool wind and we noticed a red yellow light traveling from south to north and seemed like moving slow.  We both thought of it as odd.   Then faded away before reaching the horizon.   Three more followed same path as they disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Small Intelligent Floating Lights.;2014-07-05 23:00:00;unknown;Small Intelligent Floating Lights On our way home, my wife and I noticed 6-8 seemingly glowing balls of fire slightly larger than softballs hovering maybe 50 feet over a few department stores.  They moved up and down and side to side like lighting bugs do, but they were much too big to be lighting bugs.  They were not remnants from fireworks, they moved like they were intelligent lifeforms. The strangest part is it seemed like my wife and I were the only ones who saw them.  I thought we were going crazy.  We would have recorded it, but our phones had both just died before we saw them. The event occurred at the intersection of Staples and Saratoga. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
Fast moving orange light that vanishes.;2015-10-26 22:26:00;:45;Fast moving orange light that vanishes. Went outside at 10:26 at night and looked over neighbors house and saw a bright orange light that was moving quickly across the sky.  Only lasted about 45 seconds, as it started to flicker about 3 times, then vanished.  It was so bright that it caught the corner of my eye.  Shape of fireball, heading south over the National Seashore. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065

The bright object was coming fast, I thought it was a plane, but once it was close it stopped. I ran inside to get my binoculars, once I got them I tried looking at it but something kept blocking my view as if it was blocking my view by covering the end of the binoculars, I tried several times and it kept doing the same thing. It was weird so I did the second best thing and that was grab my phone and start recording. I live out in the country so it’s super dark out here we see all the stars but this was far from a star. This isn’t the first sighting either. I didn’t report the other ones. Anyways in my video when I look at it and zoom it, it’s this circle shape object with an outer ring around it, spinning super fast I mean uncontrollably fast. Almost like lightning fast. It’s  very dark in my area, my neighbors had their porch light on we share a half an acre of land and there is one street light a quarter of a mile away from our house.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
