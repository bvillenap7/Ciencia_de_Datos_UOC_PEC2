All I could do was watch in amazement at my very first UFO sighting, too bad I was alone. The object(s) looked to be triangular in shape but in a connect-the-dots sort of way as if there was nothing in between these dots of light, there were just staying in silent formation very low over a group of houses next to mine, and seemed to look as if was being looked at while it was behind something hot.(like hot roads look like they have water on them on a hot day) Also (maybe just my imagination) I think I saw a vey faint yellowish whispy trail being left by this object as it went and dissapeared through some trees where I finally lost visual contact. The lights on this object all three of them seemed to be some sort of yellow-orange-reddish color.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065

We have made this a game and pla;2004-09-06 11:40:00;2-3 Minutes;My daughter (age 2) and I were sitting outside, when she pointed out what she thought were airplanes.  We have made this a game and play daily, during the daytime and nighttime.  We are close to an Cabinis Field Airport and relatively close to NAS Corpus Christi, so we see aircraft all the time.  When she said airplane I instinctively looked up.  What I thought we were looking at initially was two birds - seagulls. Then as I watched them I realized they were aircraft as the reflection of light made it obvious that these were metallic.   There were two of them flying in formation.   We have an airshow coming up later this month, so I assumed that they were military jets practicing for the show.  I stuck my head in the back door and told my husband what we were watching and he came outside.  As we watched them, we began to think they were birds again, not because of the way they looked but because of the way they were flying. Constantly in formation the two aircraft were manuevering several different patterns including tight circular patterns that we have never seen aircraft perform.  I'm not good with estimating altitude, but these two objects were flying below the few clouds we have in the sky today.  As they turned away from us and toward us, the reflection of the sun hitting the objects made them seem 5 times larger. They were silvery white objects of triangular shape.  There were no sounds as the aircraft went nearly over our heads.   There were no vapor trails or contrails coming off the aircraft either.  We sat there watching, not sure of what we were looking at and they just disappeared. Weird. I didn't have the presence of mind to grab my camera.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065

Triangle formation of lights in night sky disappearing into the night at the same spot in the same way as if disappearing into a hole.;2020-01-01 00:04:00;30 seconds;Triangle formation of lights in night sky disappearing into the night at the same spot in the same way as if disappearing into a hole. During New Years Eve when the neighbors were popping fireworks outside I took my daughters outside to see them while we waited for my wife to arrive from work.  While viewing the fireworks in the sky that were about 2 blocks away we noticed a triangle formation of lights that were flickering red and white and were almost above us.  The formation was located east/ southeast of the fireworks and were traveling at the same speed and seemed to hover for about 30-35 seconds.  We thought they were fireworks at first but then we noticed that they did not behave or explode with sparks like fireworks did and they lasted longer than any of the fireworks in the sky.  As they disappeared, they seemed to disappear into the darkness of the night sky only to the right of the formation and in the same way, slowly one at a time.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
