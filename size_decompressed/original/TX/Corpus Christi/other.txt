How did someone know when to come and get me, and where to look?;1999-06-01 22:45:00;10 20seconds;How did someone know when to come and get me, and where to look? I was born in 1959. My father was an independent trucker and on weekends and holidays from the age of 6-15,I went with him. He had been telling me about ,when in, West Texas at night he had seen lights in the night sky that move in a way that were not of this Earth. I first saw them when I was about 8-9 and I knew myself it was true.This is why I wasn't shocked or freaked out by what I'm going to report to you. I was living in a apartment in Corpus Christi, Texas, that a ex girl friend had rented for us when I had been away for a month working.  I had a friend over that night and we were throwing darts and visiting with each other.  There was a knock on the door and it was my ex girl friend. She was excited and asked me to come outside and follow her.  She lead me west to the parking lot and instructed me to stand there pointed to the Northwest and said look over there and talk to me a while.  We talked for a couple of minutes and while looking to the West I felt heat on the back of my neck and a yellow flash. I started turning to see what it was and between West and North there it was.  I froze.  To the NOrthwest about 400 yds away and about 150-200ft off the ground was a huge hat shaped object. The brim was fat and the crown was short.  The outside wasn't glossy it was like flat paint. It was clear as a bell.  It wasn't moving and it seemed to have no power no sound.  In a few seconds I h! eard like a loud mechanical engaging and segments like those from a digital clock appeared in random order underneath.  Then another mechanical engaging sound(like a electrical motor starter?) and the other half of the segements came on and created a wagon wheel shape, colored in darker than lime green light.  In a few seconds more it looked like it moved towards the west for just a split second and disappeared.  I couldn't tell if it flew off or went into another dimesion,but it was gone.  She was looking at me when I looked at her and she said what was that.  I said I don't know but don't tell anyone.  My other friend over heard us and started saying Yall didn't she see anything what did yall see.  We didn't respone and went back into the apartment and just acted normal until they both left. It didn't dawn on me, I guess because of the gravity of the sighting, until a couple of days later how did she know when to come get me, where for me to look, to show me what she knew was go! ing to be there.  I sent word through her brother that I needed! to see her.  In about a week she showed up after work and after visiting for a while I asked her how she knew?  She looked at me like she didn't know what I was talking about.  Years have passd and after remebering some vague statements in the 2 yrs. before the sighting she made to me, there is a bigger picture formed not in this report that make this even more interesting and important. If you are interested in these statements and my opinion feel free to contact me anytime.  I am available and have a answering machine with no caller ID.  Leave a message or I have no way of knowing who called.;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065

Shiny object near chem-trail in the sky.;2008-07-24 18:00:00;2-3 minutes;Shiny object near chem-trail in the sky. I was out smoking at my job when I was looking up to locate some chem-trails, because we get heavy amounts of chem-trail activity here. I looked up and noticed a jet that had just passed laying some trails in the sky when I noticed an object. At first I thought it was a star because it was very shiny. It seemed like it was checking out what the jet was spraying. It was too far off in the distance to notice any dramatic movements. Basically it looked like a star to me at first then it just kinda disappeared in the distance. It was daylight and getting near dark so I couldn't see any flashes or lights or like I said above, there was no dramatic movement. I did see a shiny object near a chem-trail that disappeared moments later, no lie. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065

Star shaped ufo hovers over harbor bridge for 20 minutes then vanishes!?!?!;2012-07-04 10:30:00;20 minutes;star shaped ufo hovers over harbor bridge for 20 minutes then vanishes!?!?! Was at work.  It was a Cloudy morning so when we first noticed it as thought it was a plane hovering low.  Was a black star shaped craft.   It hovered over our harbor bridge for 20 minutes in a slow circular path. Then it zoomed quickly sideways and upward.   When it did that we were able to see it was a star shape almost like a sheriff badge.  After 20 minutes it simply vanished into thin air.  It was so huge n frightening.  We attempted to take photos however they only came out as little black dot. :(;27.7422623546519;-97.4168003997065
