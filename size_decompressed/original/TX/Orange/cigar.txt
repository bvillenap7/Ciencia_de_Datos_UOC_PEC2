LARGE DARK CIGAR SHAPED CRAFT;2008-04-01 11:20:00;45 seconds;LARGE DARK CIGAR SHAPED CRAFT Clouds were rolling in just ahead of a front due in our area. I was traveling north on HWY 1130 at about 1120 am. As I glanced ahead and down the road my attention was drawn to a dark object in the clouds moving at a higher than normal rate of speed, also at an altitude of about 500 or 600 feet. The object moved from west to east and seemed to accelerate as it turned rapidly to the north and I lost it though the tree line.  I replayed it in my head over and over to try to make sense of what I saw.  If it had had two rotors I believe it could have been one of those large lifting choppers the military uses, but there were no rotors or wings of any kind.
