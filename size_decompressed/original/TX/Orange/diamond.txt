Fire and fast moving object in the sky.;2005-07-15 17:00:00;2-3 minutes;Fire and fast moving object in the sky. I was driving near the intersection of Texas Hwy 1130 and 3247 in Orange, TX facing west when this event occured. The object to the far right in the picture showed first. The brightness of it is what got my attention. That spot appeared followed by two more bright white objects in rapid succession. Grabbed my camera and took 4 shots. The sequence of events was from right to left. That was it at the time they seemed to be dissipating so I drove on. A few days later I downloaded the picture and found when I blew up the 1st two pictures it appears to be fire in the sky with a diamond shape object (the first one to appear) in the cloud to the right and the smaller object (last object) disappearing to the left. The last two shots when blown-up look like smoke rings where in the shots just seconds before appeared fire.;30.1445646817246;-93.8472501026697
