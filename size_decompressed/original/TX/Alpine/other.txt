Silent, triangle;2001-11-07 10:00:00;approx. 2 min.;Silent, triangle I was outside playing in the snow with the kids. For some reason I looked up and there it was. Flying from NE to SW against the wind. No audible noise. The shape and color were hard to tell. I couldn't tell if I was seeing 3 different triangle object fliying in a V formation,or the points of 1 larger triangle shaped craft. Also the color was strange it was silvery/translucent and seemed to reflect the color of they sky. Everything about it made it hard to tell if I was seeing a far off big object or a close small object. I watched it from about 45 degrees off my right horizon to about 60 degrees off my left horizon. Told the kids to keep an eye on it while I went in and got the camcorder. When I got back they were working on a snowman and didn't care about the UFO. I wasn't able to see it again.;30.303784090909;-103.652477272727

Me and two friends had stepped outside for a cigarette.  As we normally do we layed on our backs and admired the night sky as there is very little light pollution where we're from.  Me and one of my friends both at the same time verbally exclaimed at something we were seeing.  It appears to be an almost bird-like crescent shaped object moving through the sky.  It was invisible but we could still see it.  It was almost, cartoonishly invisible as the outline of it was pronounced but the inside of the object was invisible.  It seemed almost as if it was like a magnifying glass, warping the view of the stars above it as it traveled.  It was completely dead silent. I'm unable to determine what it's elevation was.  I saw it for 5-7 seconds, then lost track of it when I stood up to see it better.  My friend claims to have seen it continue flying then dissapear into the horizon.  Had my friend not seen it.  I'm almost certain that I would have dismissed it.  But now I'm inclined to believe that it was some sort of flying object.  Whether it was government technology or an alien spacecraft,  I am unaware.  All I know is that I did see it.;30.303784090909;-103.652477272727
