triangular shaped object with green steady lights moving slowly with no sound and disappeared.;2008-02-27 21:00:00;30-45 seconds;triangular shaped object with green steady lights moving slowly with no sound and disappeared. The shape of the craft was triangular, kind of like a kite, with bright green lights, they were not blinking lights. The craft was low it was moving slowly but not too slow, there was no sound coming from it, just dead silence. As we were following it in our car we took our phones out to record it but by the time we got our phones ready it disappeared right in front of our eyes. Two hours later other people heard the sound of a jet flying by, and this morning I also heard a jet flying by and earlier this evening there were traces of the smoke the jets leave in the sky, but the object we saw was not a jet because there was no noise coming from it what so ever and jets or airplanes donâ€™t just disappear like that.;30.303784090909;-103.652477272727
5 Triangle shaped with red and bright white lights.;2011-11-07 10:30:00;About 5 minutes;5 Triangle shaped with red and bright white lights. We saw in the distance 2 red lights side by side with a white one far above those 2.  We got out of the car and the lights split apart, 4 crafts flew above as a very low speeds and altitude.  They were all quiet with very little sound.  They were flying towards Marfa Texas, straight towards the Marfa lights.  They all began to circle back around to the left back to the direction they came from when a 5th craft began flying directly above us.  It was a triangle with one red and white light on each side and a very bright white light in the front, almost like headlights.  After turning they all went toward Fort Davis.;30.303784090909;-103.652477272727
