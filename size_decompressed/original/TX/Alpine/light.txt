Mysterious lights in the sky around Alpine, Texas;1974-11-01 20:00:00;45 minutes;Mysterious lights in the sky around Alpine, Texas Myself and two buddies (all college students) were at the edge of our small town, feeding my horse when we noticed a light in the sky, to our north at an approx. distance of 15 miles. We determined this by the objects proximity to a mountain in the same area. We noticed the light because it was moving all around but not going anywhere. It also caught our attention because there is normally very little aircraft activity in the area, due to its remote location. The light would also change colors every few minutes, from white to green and back. After observing for a few minutes, we noticed another object to our west at about the same distance, behaving in the same manner. We looked in all directions and noticed two more. One to the east and one to the south. These appeared a bit more distant. As for altitude, my guess is from 2,000 ft. for the closest two to ??? for the distant lights. Again, all were just hovering, then moving up and down, left and right. Very erratic. Finally, the lights just went out. I returned to my dorm and found my roomate was listening to his police scanner, as he was a part time ambulance driver. When I walked in, he asked if I had noticed any lights in the sky because the scanner chatter was all about mysterious lights between Alpine and Fort Davis. I told him yes, we had been observing them for almost and hour. On the scanner, we heard the Highway Patrol trying to get the Civil Air Patrol to send a plane out to the area to see if there was an aircraft in trouble. Only the light north of town was being investigated and it seemed they (autorities) were unaware of the other three lights. The scanner traffic concerning the event, finally died out and to my knowledge, nothing was done to investigate the matter. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

Three reputable witnesses see UFO over west Texas.;2008-05-03 21:20:00;ten minutes;Three reputable witnesses see UFO over west Texas. I am an attorney. I was with an owner of a major telephone company, as well as an heir to an oil and gas fortune.  We were the only ones to see them.  There were other people near us but they did not see them.  We were visiting a retired navy ship captain at his home that was built on the top of a very tall hill south of the Fort Davis mountains in west Texas.  I, along with the two others with me, was at the property line ofthis home, away from the lights of the house.  We were playing with a very expensive pair of night vision binoculars the retired captain had.  We were using them to see the incredible number of stars that were overhead.  These stars were invisible to the naked eye and when we used the binoculars you could se tons of other stars and satelites.  Then I saw it.  One of the stars directly overhead began moving in random directions, back and forth.  It had been stationary the entire time we were looking up ad then it started moving tens of degrees across the sky in mere seconds.  It moved in a random mode for several minutes.  I handed the night sight binoculars to the phone company owner and the oil and gas man.  We all saw it.  By the time we got everyone out of the house, it was gone.  I saw it take off in what would have been tens of thousands of miles per hour.  It could start and stop and maneuver in ways that no engines I have ever heard of could.  It was extremely high in orbit.  I thought it was another satellite until it began making its sharp turns and starts and stops.;30.303784090909;-103.652477272727
Silent fast moving light, no sound at all.;2012-02-10 20:00:00;5 mins;Silent fast moving light, no sound at all. Not much of video, but non the less, I just saw what looked like a funny looking light.  I told my wife, look at that light (white color), she said, it's a plane.  I told her no sound at all.  We finally stepped outside and saw it was moving past a blinking star, or so we think.  I ran inside got my portable camera and started to record it.  I attempted to keep up with it, so in the video it looks like it's moving much, but it was.  Moved silent and fast.  One light and no strobes.;30.303784090909;-103.652477272727
Bright light that followed a car for about 25min on a desert road;2020-08-29 22:00:00;25 minutes;Bright light that followed a car for about 25min on a desert road We were driving from Alpine to the camping site in Terlingua on 118, no cars were passing by us.  After 20min on the road the my boyfriend told me to look in the mirror to see what was behind us.  There was this light that was following the car, we could see that it wasnâ€™t on the road and it was up on the sky.  This light got closer and then further.  Disappeared for a few minutes and it was back again, moving to the sides.   Suddenly, the light disappeared again and when it reappeared it had three other small lights on a straight line by its side.  Then the other 3 lights disappeared and this main light continued to follow us all the way to our camping site for more 25minutes.  When we got closer to the camping site, it vanished.;30.303784090909;-103.652477272727
