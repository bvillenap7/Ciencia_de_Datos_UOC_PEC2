I was 8 yrs old. I remember sitting on the floor watching T.V and and for some reason something made me get up and go to the door. We lived in duplexes and grandpa lived next door and he was standing at the door. We both go outside and look up and there was this thing floating over the house make no noise at all it was gliding over the house. Couldn’t make out a shape cause it was to dark there were lights from the back to the front it absolutely!!!!!Made no noise!! If had to guess how long it was I’d say about 50 ft cause I noticed it stretched over our house the neighbor’s house. As it started taking a leftward turn it crossed the street over a street light and the lights flickered somewhat and then disappeared. I kept this brief there was more to point out but I don’t have a enough typing room.  Thank;31.0827137526657;-97.370986993604
