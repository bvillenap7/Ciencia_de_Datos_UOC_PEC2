Dark night and you could see the shadow of the bank flag down the street through the night sky.  Looked up at the Big Dipper and watched as one star disappeared , then the other, and then they reappeared..  At that moment I saw a huge flying wing shape with spaced circles on the bottom of the wings.  It made no sound and I watched it for a while before it disappeared over the neighbors trees from sight..  There was a lot of ground light that may have helped illumination, but the absence of sound was weird.  A city airport is nearby and you hear the drone of small planes all the time, day and night.  Two nights later watched a small plane fly in and you could definitely hear it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));31.0827137526657;-97.370986993604
