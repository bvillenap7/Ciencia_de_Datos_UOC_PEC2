Large cigar object floats and disappears over texas brushland, all in five seconds;2003-10-05 15:00:00;5 sec;Large cigar object floats and disappears over texas brushland, all in five seconds Driving north bound on Highway 755 from Rio Grande City, Texas, we were about 10 miles out. This is hilly country. Immediately after reaching the top of a hill I spotted a long cigar shaped,white colored object. The object was moving, almost hovering,over some brushland to the east of the highway. We drove in between hills and after reaching another hilltop,the object was no longer visible.  I was driving and my brother was riding shotgun.  We spotted the long object (about size of a full length tractor rig and trailer) at the same time. It was approximately 1500 hrs. No runways exist out there, no airports.  There was no sign of a crash. No dust or smoke. It was moving east at a very slow rate. There was no way it could have gone out of sight in the time it took us to climb the next small hill.Very strange and large object,shaped like a blimp.  The object reminded me of a C-5 Galaxy, an Air Force cargo plane,because of the way it was barely floating along, it was just above the brush. My brothers and I are all school administrator and were headed back from a golf outing. Only two of noticed the strange object. No way an object that big could have made its way out of our sight in five seconds. Strange, very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));26.3942000000001;-98.8103999999999
