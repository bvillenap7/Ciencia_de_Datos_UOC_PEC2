A GREEN FIREBALL STREAKED ACROSS THE SKY.  APPEARED TO BE A NORMAL METEOR, BUT THE COLOR WAS VERY BRIGHT NEON GREEN THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT WAS FAIRLY BIG.  MAYBE ABOUT 1/4 THE SIZE OF THE MOON.  SAW THIS OBJECT ON THE WAY HOME ONE NIGHT, JUST DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY, NEAR DFW AIRPORT. I HAD HEARD ABOUT THESE 'GREEN FIREBALLS' BEFORE,  FROM A FRIEND, AND TWO REPORTS FROM MY FATHER, WITHIN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS.  ONE FRIEND SAW A COUPLE OF THEM WHILE LIVING NEAR HOUSTON, AND MY FATHER REPORTED SEEING TWO NEAR DALLAS.  ALL OF THE DESCRIPTIONS I'VE HEARD INVOLVED SEEING THESE OBJECTS AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME ABOUT MIDNIGHT OR 1 IN THE MORNING, WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH MY OWN SIGHTING.  NO OTHER ODD ACTIVITY THINGS ABOUT THE OBJECT, BUT IT DID LEAVE A BRIEF TRAIL AS ANY METEOR WOULD.;32.8430700280111;-97.087456302521
