I believed it to be about 2 to 3000 feet in the air. Object was south of the freeway.  I pointed object out to my wife.  As i was watching the object for 23 seconds it appeared smaller very fast till i couldnt see it anymore.  I had visual contact with object for about 25 seconds.  I could only conclude that object left in a big hurry for it to vanish so quickly.  I could see jets heading in to land at dallas fort worth International also during this event.  The jets were heading south to north.  I know this was not a small airplane for i have seen small planes many times and i know i would of been able to distinguish wings and such but this object had nothing of the sort.;32.8430700280111;-97.087456302521
