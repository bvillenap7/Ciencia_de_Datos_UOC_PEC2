Cigar UFO DFW airport May 23rd DFW Airport.;2013-05-23 00:00:00;1 hour;Cigar UFO DFW airport May 23rd DFW Airport 	It was pretty late at night May 23rd, somewhere between 12 a.m or 1 a.m when i seen the UFO. I was at Manchester Apartments in Euless, Texas, about 8 miles from the Dallas Fort Worth Airport.  At first i seen one red blinking light and one blue blinking light standing still from the sky.  It looked like it was near or above the airport.   I got a call from a friend over at the other side of Euless saying he was looking at it to.  Me and four other friends were standing outside looking at the two lights.    We went to a field next to the apartments to get a better look, then i seen other neighbors coming outside and looking at this to.  The two lights then started moving like a pattern of some sort after 15 minutes being out there. It moved up and down and left to right.   After 30 minutes of me first watching these two lights it turned into a big bar of lights, almost like a neon grill on a cigar shaped object.  It lit up the sky.  Those lights were on but it was statio! nary for another 12 minutes.   After that the bars of lights shut off, not instant but dimmed off like if you would turn a spot light off. The red and blue lights were still going for another five minutes.  Those lights faded after that.  I didn't see anything after that.;32.8430700280111;-97.087456302521
