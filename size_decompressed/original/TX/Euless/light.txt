space based bright light that moves, then fades away;2009-07-29 22:35:00;5 seconds;space based bright light that moves, then fades away Approx 7-8 minutes ago, I went outside, looked up to the night sky, and saw what I thought was a star, turn brighter, then disappeared.  I am in the DFW area, and the object was centered due North of my position, at approx 50-55 degree inclination, just North of the Little Dipper.  It appears as though the distance would be a spaced based object.  It was not the space station or the shuttle. I know what they look like when they pass over. I am 2 miles from an airport so I know what airplanes look like.  It definately glowed brightly for 3-4 seconds, then disappeared.  It actually moved, to what seemed like a Northern trajectory from it's original position.  I know this sounds crazy, but it just happened.;32.8430700280111;-97.087456302521
