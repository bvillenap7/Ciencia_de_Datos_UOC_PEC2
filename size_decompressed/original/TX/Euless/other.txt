Today, October 14,2014 at around 3:15 me and three others saw between 100 and 150 small spherical balls of light very high in the air. The orbs appeared small and very high in elevation.  They moved away from each other and then back together consistently as they moved south through the sky.  A commercial plane flew directly over the objects appearing much higher than the objects.  Shortly after the objects began to form a shape and moved more quickly until I could no longer see them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
