It appeared to either turn or change shape from a cigar shape to a round shape with square sides and a small top on it.  It never moved and as I turned left,I looked east and it was gone.  I remeber thinking that it was such a big object to appear so far away.  I have never seen a UFO, nor thought of one, yet that is the first thing I thought when I saw it.;32.8430700280111;-97.087456302521
