A red light appeared on the horizon and moved across the sky towards us.  As it got closer, it became clear that it was more than one light.  It was a cluster of about 6 to 8 lights, arranged in a roughly circular array, with 4 lights, corresponding to 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees on the circle, being brighter than the rest.  This cluster of lights was flashing in a bizarre way, not in a pattern.  It was difficult to discern any physical shape other than the lights, but as it hovered above my house, I estimated its altitude to be about 200 feet.  It made no sound whatsoever, that I could tell.  As it stopped above the house, a spotlight shone down from it.  At this time, I became frightened and ran into the house, followed closely by my friend.;32.9598;-94.9617

As it got closer to us, it resolved itself into a cluster of red, green and blue lights, quickly flashing in what seemed a random patter. The shape of the object was not discernable, only that it was a fairly dense cluster of quickly, randomly flashing, multicolored lights that made no sound whatsoever.  We watched as this object approached my house.  At this time, it was approximately 200 feet above my house, where it proceeded to hover.  Then, a spotlight shone down from the object onto the house.  The attenuation of the light faded about 3/4 of the way to the house.  At this time, my friend and I, rather frightened by the experience, ran into the house. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
