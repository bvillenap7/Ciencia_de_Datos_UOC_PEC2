Random flashing multicolored lights, with one spotlight, shining down onto my house.;1991-05-13 23:30:00;5 minutes;Random flashing multicolored lights, with one spotlight, shining down onto my house. Standing outside in my garden, I noticed a light on the horizon.  It was red at the beginning, but after a few minutes, it got brighter as it approached and resolved into a multicolored profusion of lights.   The event lasted about 5 minutes, and during the last 30 or so seconds, the collection of multicolored, randomly flashing lights stopped directly over my house, which was about a hundred feet from the garden.  It was dark, so I couldn't discern the shape of whatever it was, just a bunch of randomly flashing multicolored lights.   It appeared to be about 100 feet above the house, and if I had to guess based on the cluster of lights as an indicator of size, I would say that it was about 20 feet wide.   Anyway, as it stopped over my house, a spotlight shone down from it onto the house.  I must emphasize that it made no noise at all during the entire time, even when it was almost directly overhead.   When the spotlight appeared, I panicked and ran into the house.  The person who I was standing with outside watching it followed me after about 15 more seconds.  After I had calmed down some, we both went back outside and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));32.9598;-94.9617
