Large green light moving incredibly fast.;2014-07-19 21:00:00;Just a few seconds;Large green light moving incredibly fast Leaving Wichita Falls on 82 and saw a large, bright green ball streak across the sky along my left side so incredibly fast it could not be anything I have knowledge of.  Too fast to be a plane.   Seemed so large that it had to be in our atmosphere and not a comet or shooting star.   It left a green tail of light that was smokey in appearance as if it was on fire but it could have just been behind some clouds.   Couldn't tell because it was too dark, but it had been cloudy that day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
