weird thing in texas;2001-12-06 22:00:00;2to3 minutes;weird thing in texas I was outside in my front yard stargazing as I often do. It was a very clear night southerly breeze. Looking up I saw a rod shaped object it was white, about 4 foot long and 6 inchs around. It was apprx. 15 foot over my head. It barely cleared the roof of my house.It was moving from north to south opposit the wind.I'm a very scientific minded person.This the second time in last few months I have seen unusual things.I guess fact is stranger than fiction. The [thing] made no sound and had no lights it was just very bright white and perectly formed.p.s. I'm an amature astronomer.;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666
Saw a Bird Shaped UFO flying towards Dallas, no noise;2008-07-16 04:00:00;7 seconds;Saw a Bird Shaped UFO flying towards Dallas, no noise I went outside, July 16, 4am in the morning, to let my dogs out, and happened to look up and saw a somewhat bird shaped ufo flying away from me, southeast towards Dallas.  It was making absolutely no noise and looked like it was about the size of a medium sized aircraft.  The aircraft had white markings on it and was dark looking, or else it was clear and I was seeing through it....It had only two lights on the back of the aircraft, and when it sensed me looking at it, it flew upwards into the clouds and dissappeared.  I hesitated to file this report as I have filed one earlier in the year.....I have also noticed small V formations in the sky, at times,  up at around 500 feet,  that have lights on them (3 or 4). Sometimes they move but most of the times they stay still....When I do happen to see them, I always see two and have seen them on two or three occassions, all in the middle of the night.;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666
