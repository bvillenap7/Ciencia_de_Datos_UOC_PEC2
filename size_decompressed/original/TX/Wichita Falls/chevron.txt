Chevron shaped object observed over Wichita Falls, TX.;2003-11-26 05:30:00;3 mins;Chevron shaped object observed over Wichita Falls, TX. I was on my back patio @5:30 am cdt when I noticed an object that appeared to be a star to the north.Soon I noticed this object was moving in a South/Southeast direction over the city of Wichita Falls.It appeared to eminate a white light that totally covered the craft displaying it's Chevron shape.I watched it @ 2 minutes and it got very close with the shape well defined when I went to awaken my husband.When we returned it had moved into or over a large cloud that was moving over our area from the south.Both my husband and I witnessed flashing lights coming from the cloud that seemed to bounce around as they flashed.My husband estimated the cloud base to be @ 2000 to 3000 ft from the ground.A few of the flashes illuminated the base of the clouds also.My husband continued to watch the lights  for about 5 more minutes.;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666
