Made a arc movement from the northern horizon up about 15 degrees and went down over the tops of neighboring houses.  Holding my fist at arms length it was about half the size of my fist. It disappeared and never came back.  I am in the US airforce and have never seen any aircraft move like this.  I believe it was a meteor but it was awful low on the horizon.;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666
I steady no blink Bright Plane Light goes one direction, sways back,  then Drops and sways like a Z;2006-11-08 00:00:00;30 seconds;I steady no blink Bright Plane Light goes one direction, sways back,  then Drops and sways like a Z The lights of the street shone bright but I could still see the stars, what a starry night tonight. There is an airport near by and often I see the flashing colors of the Cessna and Pipers coming in for a landing as I throw away the trash at night. Occasionally the Jets may be doing a late practice here by the Air Force base. Tonight was different, there was a solid light that didn't flicker at all in the east near the moon tonight. This light on this veichle was larger than normal compared to the distance I thought. So I continued to look, having to back up to watch this and get a clear view from the building and lights of the street. This solid light was doing some kind of zigzag like a Z and I stood amused at what could do this. Is this a search light? I saw this go back and forth, drop down in a sway and go forward again. Then it moved on behind the building. I looked around the building and it was gone. That surely put a damper on my depression tonight, now I'm stunned back to reality. Things are always as they seem to appear. Never say never~;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666

Object is twice as bright as Venus in my Western sky, 4 of the last 10 or 12 nights for 30 minutes hovering, slowly moves W. from site.;2012-04-06 23:00:00;30 minutes;Object is twice as bright as Venus in my Western sky, 4 of the last 10 or 12 nights for 30 minutes hovering, slowly moves W. from site. Westery sky about 10 degress above horizon or 1,000 to 2,000 feet above ground. Object was very bright light, mimics Venus but much brighter.  30 minutes stationary, platform, very bright light, hovering 1 or 3 miles West of my location. It very slowly lost altitude and brightness and dropped below the treeline from my venue after 30 minutes.  Could have been science project from the City View High School.  However, I witnessed this 4 nights out of the last 10 or 12 days in the exact same location during clear skies. At Midnight on April 7, 2012, I witnessed another object mimic a star in the night sky for 2 hours until it disappeared from site.  It was in the West North West luminating from white to red light, about 10 miles from my location at 3,000 to 4,000 feet in altitude, hovering, stationary, until it slowly moved off to the NorthWest after 2 hours of observation.   Anyhoot, these objects were not planets or stars.  However, it could have been a Roaming Candle in a bag, science project.;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666

Clusters of reddish orange lights.;2013-06-28 21:45:00;2-3 minutes;Clusters of reddish orange lights. Around 21:45 on 06/28/2013 I went outside to smoke a cigarette. To to nort I noticed numerous reddish orange lights. Most were moving from East to West. They seemed to be fading as they moved across the sky. The last few to fade moved North and faded into the distance. They made no noise. They did not blink or have anlivedy other color. There areare two more witnesses. Tried to capture on video but a streetlight blinded the image. The movement was like a leisurely stroll. They were coming from the vicinity of the air base. I've lived here for 41 years and have not seen any Military aircraft move is this manner.;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666
White light seen flying at a speed similar to a plane that suddenly changed directions ((Starlink satellites?));2019-05-01 22:00:00;5 minutes;White light seen flying at a speed similar to a plane that suddenly changed directions and flew out of sight really fast. I was over at my boyfriend's family house that evening.  I am unsure the exact date and my boyfriend cannot remember either.  I usually don't stay past 9 or 10 pm.  At around 10pm or 22:00, my boyfriend walked with me to my car which was parked on the street about 20 to 30 feet away from his house. We typically spend a few minutes together before I actually leave .  That night, we were looking in the sky and we saw what we thought was a plan. We saw a solid white orb-like light moving slowly through the sky. We were watching it and I realized that this plan didn't have the flashing light that most planes I have seen have, but we still didn't think it was anything else but a plane.  However, after watching the light move across the sky for a few minutes, the light suddenly changed directions sharply, and in an incredibly fast speed took off straight upwards and disappeared into the sky as if it reached a distance our eyes could not reach.  Both my boyfriend and I were shocked as we had never seen an object so far away move so fast and in such a strange manner. To this day, we are unsure what it is that we saw, but we know it wasn't an airplane.;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666
Blue comet like object in the daytime sky.;2021-02-18 15:30:00;3 seconds;Blue comet like object in the daytime sky. I was driving north on hwy 287 in Texas. I was a little past downtown Wichita Falls, Tx when I saw a blue object in the sky. The object resembled a comet or shooting star flying in the sky. It was light blue in color and also had a light blue tail. Initially I thought it was an object falling from the sky but as i watched it travel across my windshield it changed direction and then disappeared. The flight pattern was similar to a hook or check shape. The whole sighting lasted about 3 seconds. There was another passenger in the car who saw the object as well. He saw it out of a different window so that is what makes me think it was not a reflection.;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666
