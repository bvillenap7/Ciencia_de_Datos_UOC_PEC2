A little orange light movings as if a fairy was hovering over your head.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a planet??  PD));2019-05-02 03:00:00;1 hour & 41 minutes;Okay i need to share this with everyone and i do not care how crazy this sounds.  ((male's initials deleted)) and i are in complete shock right now.  So its 330 in the morning.  ((baby's name deleted)) woke up for his diaper change and bottle as normal.  ((male's initials deleted)) and i both woke up & fed him changed him & he went back to sleep.  So as normal we stepped out back to smoke b4 going back to bed.  As we are standing there, there isnt a star in the sky.  It has been cloudy pretty much all day.  So we are standing there and i said baby look at that (in the sky)  ((male's initials deleted)) said what is it?  And i said mars (bc it glows kinda orange).... Stood there for 30 sec both of us staring at it.  She says baby its moving its hovering.  I said no.   Well, i watched harder.  Yes, yes it was moving.  But not like a plane going in one direction.  It would go to the right, then left, down, up, a circle then up.  A little orange light movings as if a fairy was hovering over your head.  Anyways after 2 minutes of me and ((males''s initial deleted)) standing there in complete shock of what ((deleted)) we are seeing.  Saying to each other Omg baby it starts to move to the left in one direction like as if a plane would for 10 seconds and was gone.   We come back inside get in bed completely freaked out saying we arent crazy we both just saw that.  Minds are blown.  So we start looking up articles on ufo sighting Witchita Falls, TX.  Ppl seeing exactly what we saw.  So we check out you tube.  This is damn near exactly what tf we seen including all the other videos.  Idk if you ppl believe in aliens but i promise you if you were standing there with us you would of been just as freaked out. Im going back to sleep..;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666
