Red and green object that didn't move like a plane or helicopter;2014-06-18 21:30:00;~3 minutes;Red and green object that didn't move like a plane or helicoper On June 18, 2014, at approximately 9:30 p.m., my husband and I were on our back patio at our home located in the south part of the city.  We saw – twice – a “largish” object with bright red and green lights silently going up and down very quickly, then hovering for a bit.   It went down so quickly the first time my husband was waiting for an explosion that never came. I told my husband that it could possible be a helicopter doing night flights.  He said it couldn’t be because helicopters don’t move down that fast – he use to jump out of them and I completely trust his knowledge.  I don’t know what it was, but I have never seen anything like it.;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666
Disappeared and produced double ring of trianglar lights in the visible spectrum.  ((anonymous report));2015-08-16 23:30:00;35 seconds;Disappeared and produced double ring of trianglar lights in the visible spectrum. Peter Davenport, National UFO reporting center   On or about August 16, 2015, a Sunday one week before the Preside (sic.  Perseid) Meteor Shower about 11:30PM I was walking out of the main house to my bedroom apartment where I sleep,  I notice a peculiar object that resembled Meteor low in the sky around 1,200 feet in altitude and 1.5 mile away, traveling North, I saw as it passed through the partial obscured trees in the background an object the size of late model VW beetle.  This object which I thought was an meteor was emitting a trail-com of dark smoke above and white smoke below.  As the object traveled rather slow around 50 MPH I saw an aviation blue green intermediate light blinking from the aft of object and dark rotating cylinder that was turning counterclockwise which obscured the blue-green light somewhat.  The leading edge of the bow of the object was dark and I could see the wake it produced as it traveled south.  At that point the size of the bow or leading edge was about the size of the front clip of VW beetle.  As the object continued to travel it appeared to be getting smaller as if it was burning up like a traditional meteor.  However, object than started to speed up and continue to get smaller until it disappeared completely.  I continued t! o look down the trajectory of the direction traveled when it reappeared into a white flash as if it was a tracer round the size of 80 caliber bullet.  The object speed up to around 80 Mph and disappeared into the dark worm hole in the sky, and out blurted a double ring of triangle light, and inverted and the border were in aquamarine light blue. (As if it produced a smoke ring one large and one small.  This object omitted to rings of triangle light visible spectrum of light.  Each triangle of light was opaque visible light spectrum of colors inverted and with border of light blue around each of the triangle of light.  Whatever I saw was not a meteor it's impossible for meteor to disappear and produce double ring of triangular lights.  It was as if it produced or emitted double ring of triangular lights or picture a smoke ring and another smoke ring blown into and through another smoke ring.  This display of light lasted about 2.5 seconds and faded out.  I could see whatever the object was passed through into another dimension or time travel.  The hole that it passed into sky was black or darker than the night sky.  I believe I witness E.T. object traveling either forwards in time or back in time.  Unknown but unusual nothing of meteorite burning up could produce such a vast array of triangle lights.  I’ve draw sketch of what I saw however I did not include the color on the independent visible lights in swathe of brilliant color that were all in the visible field of light. I feel, I saw something time traveling or enter into alternate dimension. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

But sat out there are what appeared as a star.. this one suddenly moved North-NorthEast, stopped, moved slightly south, then moved again North-NorthEast then stopped.  Since skies were clear it appeared it was between Bowie & Nocona.  I went inside to get something to film this, came out & it was gone.  This lasted 30-minutes & wish I had filmed it. Very bright inverted-diamond.;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666
