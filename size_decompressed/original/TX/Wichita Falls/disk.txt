It was on August 10 2002 at a camp on a Boy Scout Campout. Me and my friend were staying up all night just to look at the stars. We saw a light that look like a plane but we kept looking at it coming toward us. As it came flying above us it had no sound an it was flying low. It was going slow too. It look like a clear circle with lights a round it. It had one light that changed colors. The colors were blue,white,red, and yellow. This thing kept going and we just stood there watching it until it fanished. The sourrndings were in the woods near a river called the Red River;33.922256217346;-98.512189759666
