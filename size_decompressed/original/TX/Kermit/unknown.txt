When going home from work I saw what looked like the smoke from a jet plane moving towards each other like they were about to hit but they didn't there was a big one and a small one I watch it for about 5 minutes. Then the big one stopped moving and was steady I Kept watching it and it looked like it was moving away from me like it know that I saw it. The small one that almost it hit was now following it and then I saw another one. I got close enough to see some kind of shape on it Like it was trying to be invisable but you could see part of the outline. I did see the same 3 things this last summer when I was coming home from Monahans a town that si only 20 miles away but I didn't think anything about it until today. I don't know if I saw a UFO or not but I did see something this evening.;31.8518;-103.0825
