It slowly went west for about 2 minutes. It then sped off to the west. My freind, who wishes to remain anonymous, said Did you see that? I told him I did. About 10 minutes later, another appeared and did the same thing Me and a freind were sitting in the back of my dad's truck. We were looking at the stars when I noticed a light in the south kind of moving. My first thought was that it was a meteor, but it was moving a little slow for one. Then it turned to the east which meant that it did a 90 degree turn. I had never seen a meteor do that. Then, about 45 seconds later, it did a 180 and went west. It went that way for 45 seconds. Then, it just shot off to the west. My freind and I kept talking about it. Then we noticed another one just like it. It did the exact same thing, except it was there about 4 and a half minutes. This can not be a meteor, i have seen meteors before, but none like this one.;32.278;-101.4534
Multiple lights appeard in sky East of Big Spring Texas.;2002-02-08 18:00:00;20 minutes;Multiple lights appeard in sky East of Big Spring Texas. While traveling from Louisiana to Tucson AZ, we were on I-20 just outside of Big Spring Texas.  It was just after the sun went down.  Lights began to appear around the cloudless sunset.  The sizes varied.  The objects looked like a straight line allmost like a vapor trail except the trails didn't change length.  Instead, they moved and altered positions but 45 and 90 degrees at a time.  It started with one and eventually there were 6 in the sky.  All of them were ti the EAST of our position.  There are some pictures as well as video recorded on Hi 8. Pictures upon request. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request photos from the witness, but we suspect they may be contrails, reflecting light from the setting Sun.  PD));32.278;-101.4534
Purple haze/light in sky at 3 AM and vanished.;2016-05-21 03:00:00;30 seconds;Purple haze/light in sky at 3 AM and vanished. I was walking my dog, trying to take pictures of him, when he started growling and barking.  Startled, I start looking around I then noticed a purple haze in an oval form in the sky.  I was able to take a picture but before I could video it was gone.   This morning I get on Facebook and see a post asking if anyone had seen it, and I posted my picture.   I was then directed to this page.;32.278;-101.4534
