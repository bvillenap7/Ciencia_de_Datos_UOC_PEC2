Reflective Sphere in the sky;2020-11-21 12:00:00;3 mins;Reflective Sphere in the sky On Nov 21, 2020 around 1:09PM in the afternoon I was walking my dog and the sun went partway behind this big cloud. I looked up and saw some pretty colors like the aurora lights, close to what I can describe. I took a few pictures and then continued walking my dog. Later I looked at the pictures and to my surprise there was something in the picture. I never saw it because sun was pretty bright and I was looking at the colors and not above the cloud.  I don’t know if this is anything or not but thought I would send in and see. Just really interested in what it is. I am sending in a couple of pictures. One you can see it clear but the other you can barely see it at the top of the cloud head.  It looks like a sphere with some reflective mirrors on it but could be just a play of lights. I’m not sure so I’m sending to the experts. I did not hear anything just saw the pretty colors in the clouds. Thanks for looking into this.;32.5132;-95.9072
