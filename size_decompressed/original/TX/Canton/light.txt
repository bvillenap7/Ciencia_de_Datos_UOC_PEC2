Weird light in the sky next to an airplane tower;2009-01-30 21:00:00;2-4 minutes;Weird light in the sky next to an airplane tower On Friday January 30, me and my mom went to the store.  On the way back, we were driving down our road when my mom saw something.  She pointed out a strange light near this red blinking airplane light thing.   Anyways, the light color was a goldish yellow I guess.  Perhaps the color of a star or something.   I thought it might be another light like the airplane one then remembered, they didn't put up any new lights!  So we watched this light in the sky as we were driving and it didn't move.  Didn't do anything!  But it was weird.   The size was to large to be a star or planet, and it was to close to the ground. It was just a strange light. Every night since then I look out my windows at the red light to see if the other light is there.  Hasn't been since.;32.5132;-95.9072
