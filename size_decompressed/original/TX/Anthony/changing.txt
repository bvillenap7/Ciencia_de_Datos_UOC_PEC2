Cloudy white orb and I thought I was mistakenly seeing something.  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch.  PD));2018-02-06 19:28:00;45-60 seconds;Waiting outside my stairs I acknowledged to what seemed like a cloudy white orb and I thought I was mistakenly seeing something when I saw it move so when I actually made sure of it I called my mom it then traveled a great distance, after she went inside  Then that orb kind of expanded into a big teardrop shaped cloud then little by little it disappeared but it kept its course straight like it wasn't till the end of the cloud that you can see it disappear but the cloud stayed there for a bit after it happened.
