White light lower than aircraft slowly moving across sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of International Space Station.  PD));2006-11-09 18:00:00;5 minutes; ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of International Space Station.  PD)) White light lower than aircraft slowly moving across sky I left messages with 2 different TV meterologists who have not returned my calls. About an hour ago right before it got totally dark, I saw a light go to the southwest from where I am in East Texas. It looked like a spot light from a helicopter or something. But it was too high to be a helicopter. The speed was steady and not too fast. It just caught my eye and I followed it for about a minute before it went over the tree line. I could see planes very high in the air and of course stars. But this was a bright white light. No red lights. No flashing. I was outside by myself and then my girlfriend came out and I was telling her about it. Then within about 10 minutes, we both saw in the same general area, a bright white light. It did not move. And then it faded. I was pretty big. It did not streak. It did not blink. It just went out or if anything, it's like it went up. I was much lower than the airpalnes flying at night, which I could see them. I don't know if I believe in UFOs. I always sort of believed in them. But this was not an airplane, helicopter, or anything man made. It was not a meteor. It was kind of like the international space station flying over, but this was pretty low. Any ideas? Did I just see a freaking UFO? ((CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Thanks for the note, ((name deleted)), and thank you for the report!
