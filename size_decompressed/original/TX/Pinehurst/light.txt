Second Light near Pinehurst, Texas;2012-10-31 20:15:00;2 minutes;Second Light near Pinehurst, Texas This report is about an hour or so after the other, so about 20:15, I came out of the Krogerâ€™s lot at 249 & 2920 (in Tomball)  heading north once more, I passed CVS and noticed there was a Bright Light again in the northwest sky.  This Light was not as bright as the other one.   As I headed north I passed the seafood restaurant on the right which is near West Rollingwood & 249 North.  As I came up to the 249 and 1744 split the light started to move east and not as bright.  It was an amber colour with no strobes or marker lights of any kind.  I made a right on to 249 (towards Magnolia) and I lost the light behind the trees.     I am a former truck driver and now small business owner.;30.1586;-95.6876
A craft, to low to be a satellite, too fast to be a plane, completely silent, flew across the night sky for a second, only to vanish.;2014-09-23 23:00:00;1 second;A craft, to low to be a satellite, too fast to be a plane, completely silent, flew across the night sky for a second, only to vanish. I'm a sceptic. I don't believe ANYTHING unless I see it for myself. However, last night I was in my backyard when I happened to look up in the clear sky at the exact moment an unidentified flying object with a red light and a white light (may have had another light, but I know I saw a distinct red) darted a short ways across the sky, only to disappear into thin air. It was too low to be a sattelite, WAY too fast to be an airplane (VERY fast), and COMPLETELY silent. Living in the country, I've seen hundreds of shooting stars, and this was absolutely NOT a shooting star. It was low enough for me to make out a vague outline of the craft. Unfortunately it happened so fast it's hard to say exactly what shape it was.  In fact, I don't think it was even visible for a full second.
