Thursday, February 4, 2021 Approximately 8 pm Sweetwater, TX While driving north, just leaving the city limits on fm419, one other person and I witnessed an unusual point of light in the sky. It was of a steady and unwavering hue, abnormally brilliant. I was instantly drawn to it because it was apparently moving toward the south and descending in altitude at an incredible speed. I say this because we both observed an increase in apparent diameter and brightness that went from negligible to alarming in a matter of a couple seconds. Then it stopped. It remained stationary for several seconds. Still no flashing or shimmering. The hue was red, somewhat neon. Definitely exceptional in it's radiance. Both of us were awestruck. Then it took off away from us, receding from us, it seemed, and within a further two seconds had completely gone out of sight. The whole thing lasted maybe ten seconds. To us both, it was a decidedly remarkable experience and uniquely strange.;32.4716;-100.3942
