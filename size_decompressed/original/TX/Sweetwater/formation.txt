I took my dog out , and saw a bright light closer than all the other stars in the sky. Something appeared above it. Something red it appeared. To close to be a star. It is a clear night. I waited and watched. The object never moved it appeared, until I took pictures and videos .  Only in the video can you see movement. When I look it is fixated and does not Move. The video and pictures show a circular bright shape that has something in the center. Hard to describe without just sharing what I took with my iPhone. In the picture only and video it appears to go side side as there is a light also around it like a fog and it moves. It is still there and it is 2:49 am. I am going back in. So I cannot say length of time whatever it is will be in the sky. I have seen planes, and all kinds of things in the Texas sky. I have never not been able To tell what something was. It is to Close for a Star. If you would Like my pictures video. Please contact me.;32.4716;-100.3942
