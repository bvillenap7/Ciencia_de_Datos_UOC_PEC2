In November of 1988, my friend and I were on our way to Dallas, Tx.  We hit Sweetwater, Tx at about 11:00 pm, and we were on the interstate.  We were not the only ones to see this.  First, there were two small shapes that were shooting all over the sky.  They were red, one shaped like a stop sign and the other like a triangle.  They were everywhere.  People were stopping along the road and getting out of their vehicles to watch the show.  We didn't stop, as we were expected in Dallas at a certain time.  After about 20 minutes, we saw a huge shape covering the sky.  The little ones were red, but this thing was blue and purple.  It looked like a huge lego brick that moved very slowly and had no sound at all.  It looked like the size of at least three football-sized fields long.  It had no sound at all.  As soon as it passed overhead, the two little ones went into it and then came out.  We don't remember anymore of what happened.  We got into Dallas at about 2:30 am, and didn't speak about the event until last November 23, 2002.  We hadn't seen each other for about 12 years.  Weird, huh??

We left Hobbs, NM at about 7/00pm and when we hit Sweetwater, TX, it was about 9/00 or 9/30pm.  We were on the interstate and we noticed that everyone else was stopping and getting out of their vehicles to look up into the sky.  We were headed to Dallas, TX, and didn't want to get there too late, so we didn't stop.  She said to look out the windows to see what everyone was looking at.  I did and saw two shapes doing things that conventional aircraft couldn't do.  They were doing things that were impossible.  It was a stop sign shape and a triangle shape, both outlined in red, doing things that are not possible.  They were here in the skky and then they were there, from one side to another.  Up, down, sideways, horizontial, vertical, it wasn't possible.  Then the big one, that they kept flying into and out of came by.  It was huge, shaped like a lego brick.  On the ! under layer, that we   could see, it had purple and blue lights, they weren't blingking, they were steady, it was the size, easily of three football field lenghts in shape, it looked like a lego brick.  It made no sound.  No sound.  We watched until we got clear of Sweetwater, TX, and  then it, or they werer gone.  We got to Dallas, TX, at about 1/30 or so, we missed some time.
