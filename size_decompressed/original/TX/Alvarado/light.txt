Hey, it's Following Us!;1987-09-25 18:00:00;10 min;Hey It's Following Us! A friend and I were leaving his house and we saw what we thought was a weather balloon.  It wasn't dark outside but the sun had just went below the horizon.  As we proceeded toward the town of Alvarado we kept noticing that it was changing the side of the car it was on.  We said to one another  Hey it's following us.  When we arrived in town the light was just on the other side of the highway ,and looked to be about fifty feet off the ground.  So we pulled into a church parking lot and decided to go that way.   As we started toward it, it remained just ahead of us for about two miles at that point it made a instant ninety degree turn and went straight up.  It was gone in less than a second.
