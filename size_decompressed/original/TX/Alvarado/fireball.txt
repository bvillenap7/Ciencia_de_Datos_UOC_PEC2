Fireball in Alvarado;1984-11-14 20:00:00;2 seconds;Fireball in Alvarado My cousin and I were both about 8 years old. If my memory serves me correctly, it was Thanksgiving night. We were playing behind the house on our uncle's two-acre property. I looked up for some reason and a fireball seemed to descend at a slight arc directly into my face. The fireball was changing with reds, oranges, and yellows moveing about and actually looked as if it was on-fire. From my prospective, it changed from the size of a golf ball to totally engulfing my whole line of sight. It only took about 2 seconds for it to descend to me and it was not a direct path, but instead slightly arcing. Startled, I looked at my cousin who also seemed surprised. We briefly discussed the occurrence with great excitement, as children do, and ran back to the house. I can't remember the exact reaction from any of our adult relatives, but I do recall that no notice was paid to our story. To this day, my cousin and I remember and occasionally discuss our experience. The hair on my neck stands up every time. I don't know exactly what happened, but this two-second occurrence has solidified my belief in intelligent life beyond earth. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.4395;-97.2130000000001
