At first I thought it was a hot air balloon, but friends said they do not fly at night.  The top was red and shaded orange toward the bottom.   Moments later, the second object appeared moving in the same direction as the first.  The only difference was, this one was red at the bottom and no distinct color on top.   Then they were gone.;32.4395;-97.2130000000001
