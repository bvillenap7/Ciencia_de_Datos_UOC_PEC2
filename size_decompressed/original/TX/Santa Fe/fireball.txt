2 stationary fireballs.;2013-08-14 22:39:00;4 minutes;2 stationary fireballs I walked outside my house and instantly looked toward the southwestern sky.  Close to  the horizon were 2 stationary lights. They were red-orange in color.  They didn't move at all. The sky was overcast completely.  I couldn't even see the moon or any stars.  We had a severe thunderstorm about 2 hours prior.  The air was still and everything was quiet.  The lights were at a distance, but they were quite noticeable and bright.  After viewing them for about 30 seconds, I turned around to open the front door to yell for my husband.  When I turned back to the southwest, I saw that one of the lights were dimmed and then disappeared.  My husband came outside about 20 seconds later, and I showed him the remaining light.  We stared at it for about 2 minutes, then it dimmed and eventually disappeared.  My opinions-The way they seemed to burn out made me think they were fireballs.  They were not in the normal flight paths for aircraft in this area.  The way they were absolutely still was quite strange.  I wonder if there were more of the fireballs prior to me going outside in the first place.  Tomorrow I will take a photo of how the area looks during the day, and where I remember the fireballs were.;29.3953575757576;-95.0820454545455
