Also “05-04-2012 @22:15 - occurrence Santa Fe, Texas” a sighting of my own. Shape:  Disk  Duration:15-20 seconds **   Additional Details for Occurrence:  3/72015 20:40 hours  Reported:  3/9/2015  Posted: 3/13/2015**  The very next day, Sunday 3/8/2015, I was not at home, however my wife reported to me that she heard the very same intense noise occurrence’s twice, during the day while she was busy inside the house.  The first one at approx. 08:30 hours and a second one at approx. 13:20.  I asked her did she make it outside to see whether or not it may have been the same thing?  She stated the first time she heard it she was headed toward the front door to look but about half way there the noise diminished as quick as it came about but shook the house and rattled windows just the same as the night before. Then later in the afternoon the same thing, so she didn’t even bother and sure enough had she tried but due to not being that close to either the front or back door to the house she would have missed it.  Both occurrences this time would have been in broad daylight instead of after dark the evening before when she saw whatever this “perfectly round object” may have been in the sky.  What has really played upon my mind was when this first occurrence woke me up out of a sound sleep as stated, sounding like a jet air liner flying way too low for whatever reason.  The distinct high pitched sound of jet propelled turbine engines and of course the intense noise of something really cooking through the air. It wasn’t until I read another report from this web site which occurred on 3/6/2015 from Conroe, Texas, (the very day before) where the author apparently familiar as a former Navy cryptologist writes about the “Alert/Intercept single pilot Fighter Jet deployed in full afterburner” maneuvering through Houston IAH Airspace as such to gain maximum speed. That an alert exercise would not happen right through the holding pattern of Houston IAH.  I take that to mean holding patterns of two significant airports that I know of in Houston, Bush International and William P. Hobby including what air traffic still coming and going from Ellington Field Air Force Base in South Houston and several other smaller private airports in the surrounding area.  What little I know about the reported sightings of these unidentified flying “disk shaped” objects is usually they are silent.  At best some sort of low pitched humming sound if that? Which perhaps explains what I heard, my wife heard and saw and perhaps what she as well, didn’t see?  Could this have been the case regarding this ground shaking noise (jet engines)?  One or more of our “fighter jets” that for whatever reason my wife didn’t or couldn’t see, perhaps perusing or attempting to  this “perfectly round object” with the two red lights with a single bright white one in the middle as described in my original report? All kinds of questions arise in my mind as to just what the heck was this particular event? If this was the case then why couldn’t she see any jet in addition to when s looked up just in time to see its approach, then straight up as it flew directly overhead as “it then took off out of sight like a shooting star” regarding speed, sight, sound, everything to do with it, gone with in a split second! In attempts to rationalize the distinct sound of a jet engine winding down or up could this craft have perhaps been jet powered itself? Or if there was a fighter jet in pursuit it would seem logical enough reason for the distinct sound of jet turbines associated with it? Very plausible if it came in from the Gulf, which would have been in the same direction it came from and just a few miles away as “the Crow/or a disk in this case, flies” and basically took off as described, leaving any type of jet far, far, behind in an instant? What now stands out is why couldn’t a jet engine still be heard afterwards until fading in the distance in going away from a stationary position on the ground?  There’s absolutely no doubt in my mind what so ever that my wife did not see, exactly what she described. Of which I failed to mention, even though the lighting conditions was dark the sky itself in the area we live was light enough to distinguish the difference in the configuration between a low flying air plane, helicopter, or as in this incident this blacked out perfectly round disk with the exception of said lights up front which may have assisted her in seeing the thing at all. Now she wishes she hadn’t seen it as she remained perplexed for a few days like I did upon seeing what I saw on 05-04-12 while on my way to work (a spectacular light show of these multicolored to white and ! then orange light orbs) one night and knows now how I felt for quite some time in trying to figure out what I saw and still to this very day. Upon checking back with this website (N-UFO Reporting Center) in seeing my report was posted regarding a 03/07/2015 Santa Fe, Texas sighting, I noticed the following reports of sightings reported also in the same general geographical area and close proximity to each other  within one day plus apart. Note to Director of NUFORC: Please feel free to edit or not even post at all due to length. I will also include additional contact numbers in the proper fields of report submission form should an investigator already tried to contact me and couldn’t get through as I am willing to assist in any way with in my ability to perhaps do so. For any potential interested experienced investigator since there seems to be enough activity in this particular area of Texas (along The Gulf Coast and within a radius of I’d say 300 miles or so inland) not to mention Texas alone having such a high collective number in totality.  I have taken the liberty to cut and paste some of your most recent posts from your website regarding this area for any investigator perhaps not recognizing all these towns and cities by name as to their proximity to each other and incorporating them  into my supplement. By pulling up a map of Galveston County, Texas, and cross referencing with your website you will see that just about each and every city and unincorporated area (towns) it appears, has added multiple sightings over and over again. Especially regarding these orbs of light. I begin with the first one being most interesting to me as it is the one which coincides with the sighting my wife saw the very next day following this persons sighting regarding unusual activity of one of our own fighter jets. If this persons conclusion is correct, then just WHY was this fighter jet sent up in the manner described and for WHAT if anything it may have seen for itself? Not something most any of us could or would get an answer to in making a simple telephone call to the proper authority.  This occurrence was/is only approx. 73 – 81 miles from our residence taking a jet once in the air in afterburner mode if sent up again the very next day for yet another unknown air craft investigation possibly coinciding with our report, a matter of minutes to get from Conroe to the coast?  ** Denotes added by this author** National UFO Reporting Center Sighting Report Occurred : 3/6/2015 14:35 (Entered as : 03/06/15 14:35)Reported: 3/8/2015 9:27:08 AM 09:27 Posted: 3/13/2015 Location: Conroe, TX  Shape: Other Duration:3 minutes **located about 40 miles (64 km) north of Houston ** Alert intercept/fighter in full afterburner, manoevering  through Houston IAH airspace.  Report: Intercept/fighter launched around Houston. I am a former navy cryptologist familiar with launching alert aircraft. On the reported date, I witnessed a single jet interceptor/fighter. I sighted him then pulled over, exited my vehicle and took apx a dozen very clear photos of his manoever from east to north-northeast. Very clear contrail on essentially a cloudless day.  He was in afterburner and gaining altitude to go faster.  An alert is not going to happen as an exercise especially right through the holding patter of Houston IAH.
