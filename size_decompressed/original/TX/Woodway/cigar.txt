I SAW A LONG, I SUPPOSE CIGAR SHAPED,BUT NOT SKINNY, CRAFT...FLYING IN THE LATE AFTERNOON BUT STILL BIGHT SKY. (I SAW LARGE WINDOWS, SQ OR RECRTANGLE.) IT WAS PICKING UP MUCH SUNLIGHT. I HAD NEVER SEEN A PLANE REFLECT THAT MUCH SUNLIGHT. I DID NOT HEAR A NOISE. IT WAS NOT VERY HIGH. I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO LOW FOR NO SOUND AND I SAID TO MYSELF, THATS THE LONGEST PLANE I EVER SAW. IT APPEARD TO MOVE INTO SHADOW BECAUSE IT DIMMED A TINY BIT. AND THEN COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED!!, WITH NO CLOUDS NEAR IT. THERE WERE BRIGHT WHITE CLOUDS, BUT NO CLOUD WAS NEAR IT . IT JUST DISAPPEARED,BLINKED OUT, RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES. I STRAINED TO MAKE MYSELF SEE IT BUT IT WAS GONE. ( PLEASE UNDERSTAND IT WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY ACTUALLY AND WASNT MOVNING OUT OF OF SIGHT.) TOO LOW, TOO SLOW, TOO SILENT AND TOO LONG AND FAT.
