Unkown Squadron;2007-05-16 15:00:00;30 minutes;Unkown Squadron Last summer, my little cousin and I were hunting birds in my backyard with a pellet gun.   As I was looking through the scope, I noticed what looked like a formation of 5 dots traveling in a triangular form.  I thought they were jets and told my cousin to see.   He checked and said that there was now 7 dots in the formation.   I kept following them through the scope.  We kept looking at them and noticed they were metallic.   Every now and then their glare would blind us through the scope.   For some reason, they kept going in a circular path.   We kept passing the gun to each other, then I noticed that there was 6 left.   I hogged the scope and watched as one by one, they started to break off of the formation.   When there was only 3 left, they went in a straight path north.   They started speeding and speeding until I couldnâ€™t see them anymore.;26.2258827476038;-98.3305830670936
