Possible ufo sighting.;2011-10-21 22:30:00;2-3 hrs.;possible ufo sighting. it was on october 24th. me and some friends and family had just got back from a haunted house in corpus christi. this is the second time we have seen this object in the sky..  It has very vivid bright lights 4-5 different colors. red, blue, green, purple and white..  we have watched it very visible to the eye. with binoculars its a round shape or a triangle shape.  it only moves up and down left to right.  we have never seen a different path from it.  we live on the ocean so it appears to be over the sea. we are no experts in flying air craft but common since can tell you its no star nor airplane, weather balloon or satilite..  please let me know what you the expert think.  this is not a joke nor a hoax!!  thank you for your time and patience in reading my sighting story.;28.0314;-97.0669999999998
