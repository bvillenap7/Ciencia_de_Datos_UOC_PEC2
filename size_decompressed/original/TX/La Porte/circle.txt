Bright white circular object flying around in broad daylight;2011-09-12 14:45:00;5 minutes;Bright white circular object flying around in broad daylight I was outside at work and saw a round white object about 50 feet away, seeming to come from behind a building at about a 20-foot height. It looked about 8-10 inches wide. My first impression was that it was a small plastic bag caught by the wind, but then I watched it maneuver for at least 5 minutes. It was not randomly drifting around in wind currents, but moving rapidly in straight lines, stopping, and changing direction. The object moved North for several hundred yards while continuously ascending. After a minute or so, it turned and moved several hundred yards back South, still ascending, until it was almost overhead. Then it changed direction again, going straight up until it was no longer visible due to distance. This all happened in a bright blue sky with only a few very high clouds. At first, it looked almost like a flat circle, but at some points, it appeared  spherical. It stayed bright and visible at such a long distance that I wondered afterwards if it might have been emitting light. Have no idea what this object was, but it was a shocking experience.;29.691028169014;-95.0469676056339
((HOAX??))  The light was so bright I thought the neighbors' house was on fire.  Bright red lights there was no sound.;2016-02-12 21:00:00;7 seconds;The light was so bright I thought the neighbors house was on fire.  Bright red lights there was no sound.  By the time I went outside, all I could see was a faint red dot in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
