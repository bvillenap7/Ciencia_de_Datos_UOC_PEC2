I was about 8 or 9 years old and was with my sister's female friend who was 18 years old and we were standing near the bay about 3:00 in the afternoon when something caught both our attention in the sky, without looking at each other we said at the same time do you see that?,  we saw way up in the sky a saucer shaped object that was light colored with a orange glowing light underneath it. This object was flying in the air and then changed course and went straight up at an angle into a small isolated cloud and never came out.  We also saw a small airplane in the same vicinity and wondered if the pilot had seen it too.;29.691028169014;-95.0469676056339

I kept my eyes on it & noticed it was silently very slowly moving. I took several pictures before taking the video everytime i zoomed in appeared to have many lights around the disc. A few beams of light flashed down to the area & the light became brighter. Like a flash from a camera. The middle light was bigger & slowly turning clockwork as if it was scanning the area. Ir stayed scanning for over an hour. I watched attentively until i got spooked for it appeare to know or at least i felt it knew i was watching for it was moving my way, pointing the big light my way so i stayed away from window & stopped recording. Oh, there was a steady red dot behing it the entire time as well.;29.691028169014;-95.0469676056339
