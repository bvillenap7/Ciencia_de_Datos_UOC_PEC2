I noticed a light, about the size of a star, rapidly blinking red and white. The object was very high in the sky, moving very swiftly, in a zig-zag pattern, from north to south. It moved much faster than any plane I had ever seen. As it passed over I stood up to get a better look and it split into two orbs right before my eyes. They both continued on in a zig-zag pattern to the south and I lost sight of them.;29.691028169014;-95.0469676056339
