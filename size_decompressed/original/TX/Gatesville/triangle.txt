Silent slow moving wide triangular non illuminated object.;2008-08-20 22:00:00;5-6 seconds;Silent slow moving wide triangular non illuminated object. I was walking across the street from visiting my neighbor. I paused to look up to see if I could see any shooting stars, as I read this past week was active for shooting stars.  After looking up and scanning the sky for a few moments, it took a few seconds for me to realize that I was seeing something very large was passing over the neighborhood.  It did not have lights, was comepletely silent, moving slowly from north to south.  I was able to make out the widened triange shape as my eyes adjusted to the dark, and as it blocked out the stars as it traveled.  It seemed to be at the level of a low flying airplane. and seemed as wide as a house.  It appeared to have lighter and darker areas in on the bottom of it, but not illuminated.  I only got a quick glimpse of it as I was in town, with too much lamplight, trees, and houses. I am surprised I could see it at all, as it had no lights.  I know though that I saw something, because it blocked out the stars, and blocked out a red flashing light from an airplane flying very high in the sky.  Not a cloud, not a bird, though my mind's first split seconds impression was a gliding bird, or a kite until I realized it was way too large and was triangular shaped. I live north of Ft. Hood, and wondered also if it is some kind of military stealth craft.;31.4177;-97.833
