As I opened the gate to the ranch we noticed a light in a oval shape moving across the clear sky at an extremely fast rate. We proceded to our deer blinds and while there continued to see a lot of activity. These objects kept moving and follwing each other, at 6:10am we noticed that one of them had come down enough to where we could see that it had many color almost chrome like. The sunrise came up and we were unable to the the activity anymore.;26.7199;-98.4526
