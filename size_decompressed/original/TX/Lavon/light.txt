Large still bright light hanging low over Lake Lavon, TX;2008-10-17 23:00:00;10 15 min;Large still bright light hanging low over Lake Lavon, TX I was outside about 11:00 pm getting some air and I witnessed a bright light hanging low…not flashing…over the lake. It was very still. The more I stared at it the more it looked as though there were light beams shining down from below the larger bright light. I turned my head for an instant and it was gone.  It just disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));33.0168;-96.4343
