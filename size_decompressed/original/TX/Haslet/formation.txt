Orange glowing orbs in formation slowly moving across the night sky.;2015-04-04 22:25:00;~1 minute;Orange glowing orbs in formation slowly moving across the night sky. I was on my way home at night and noticed about 8 orange lights in the sky, 7 of which were in an arrow formation, and a single light behind the arrow formation.  They were softly glowing and appeared to be all slowly moving to the right, and then one by one they started to slowly fall and fade away until there was one left, just falling.   I tried to keep watching the last one fall, but it fell out of my view.  It appeared to be getting pretty close to the ground, though.   Right as I was about to turn into my neighborhood, just moments after the last orange glowing light was out of sight, I saw an orange burst of light out in the distance, maybe a couple of miles away.  I'm not sure if the burst of light was connected with the UFO, but it could have been. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
