A lighted object went by.  Can't be sure of size or how far away or how far up it was.  Sphere was illuminated by steady, flickering, yellowish light.  No blinking, on-off lights. No sound.  It could have been a candle underneath a homemade hot air balloon.  However, we think the flight path was too straight, too fast and it maintained exact elevation and exact direction during the entire period of sighting.  The wind was blowing in the same general direction, but it was gusting, not steady.  The object didn't behave like you'd expect a balloon to.;32.9567;-97.336
