Cone shape that changed to circle  seen over Tamaulipas Mexico from Harlingen Texas.;2006-01-02 17:15:00;7 mins;Cone shape that changed to circle  seen over Tamaulipas Mexico from Harlingen Texas. It was Monday evening about 5:15 when my spouse noticed a cone shaped object S.W. of Harlingen.  There were no clouds or aircraft in the sunseting sky.  I looked in the vicinity of where the object was to see if it was an aircraft but then noticed how far off it was and realized it was huge.  The size of it is what got my attention.  By the size and how far off it was it had to have been over Mexico.  It seemed to morph from a cone shape into a circle.   I would not dismiss the possibility of it being a cloud. However the sky was totally clear in all directions and the shapeshifting happened in the course of about 5-7mins. But I am submitting this just in case there are more reports of the same sighting.;26.1957543697475;-97.6943677310934
