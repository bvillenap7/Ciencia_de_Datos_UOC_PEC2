Large Blue Light-1st Snow in 105 years.;2004-12-24 21:00:00;20min.;Large Blue Light-1st Snow in 105 years. Witnessed a large (approx.size-1 city block) BLUE FOG LIGHT MIST, beaming upwards from ground up in a large field, upon uproach it moved or reappeared instantaneously approx. 1 mile down the road.  Followed it for several miles as it appeared and reappeared until it was out of reach.  Electrical transformers atop light poles were exploding in areas light traveled. This evening (12-24-04)brought snow for the first time in 105 years.   Two years later our local newspaper Valley Morning Star had a story about a farmer who was burning his field for tick infestation and discovered two large rings imprinted in his field in the same area my wife and I followed blue light/mist.  Farmer indicated that his son who was on leave from Iraq war was alone in his home on X-mas eve of 2004 when suddenly a large blue light completely covered their home and ranch.  I know a UFO crew was called, but we have not heard anything since. I just wanted to report this in case someone else has seen it.  PS: Contact Valley Morning Star for more info. on farmers story. Good Luck. RAMBO;26.1957543697475;-97.6943677310934
