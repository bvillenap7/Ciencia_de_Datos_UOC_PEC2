MY HUSBANDS SMOKES OUTSIDE BEFORE HE GOES TO BED EVERY NIGHT ‘SO I DECIDED TO GO OUTSIDE WHILE HE WAS OUT THERE… I LOOK UP TO LOOK AT THE STARS WHEN SOMETHING ON MY PERIPHERAL VISION CATCHES MY ATTENTION,  AT FIRST I WAS IN AW DISBELIEF OF SORTS BUT ONCE I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOTHING WITH A REASONABLE EXPLANATION:  BIRD/PLANE/SATELLITE/BALLOON ETC. I KEPT MY EYES ON IT TO BETTER OBSERVE IT.  IT WAS GOING AT A FAST SPEED (NOT A RAPID SPEED), I EVEN WALKED OVER TONS OF THORNS BAREFOOT WITHOUT EVEN HESITATING ‘I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO REALLY TAKE A VERY GOOD LOOK AT IT FOR A GOOD 2-3 MINUTES. I WAS YELLING FOR MY HUSBAND TO COME AND TAKE A LOOK AND DESCRIBING IT DURING THE WHOLE EVENT BUT BY THE TIME HE MADE IT TO ME AND WITH HIS POOR EYE SIGHT IT WAS TOO LATE.  I DON’T DRINK, I DON’T SMOKE, NOR DO I DO ANY DRUGS, I’M NOT CRAZY OR MENTAL IN ANY WAY, AND I’M NOT A LIAR EITHER. THE OBJECT WAS VERY CLOSE TO LAND (ESTIMATING 400 FEET BUT COULD OF ACTUALLY BEEN CLOSER THAN THAT), VERY SILENT/NO NOISE AT ALL, BIG, NO LIGHTS, TRANSLUCENT IN COLOR BUT YOU COULD STILL SEE IT (WEIRD I KNOW’ I’M STILL HAVING TROUBLE DIGESTING THIS MYSELF). HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT I SAW WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IN THE WORLD THAT WAS OR IS.;26.1957543697475;-97.6943677310934
