Very large, low to the groung, bright green light shot across Harlingen, TX sky;2014-12-15 19:00:00;20 seconds;Very large, low to the groung, bright green light shot across Harlingen, TX sky I was driving down the expressway south on 83 near New Hampshire street and from far left in the sky a very large bright green light moving at a fast speed went all the way from far left of my vision to far right, and it was so low and so large that i thought it was going to crash into the earth, and just when i prepared for impact it looked as if it burnt out. I have seen many shooting stars in my life, but this was much bigger and much closer to the ground, i know there must be many others that seen it as well..;26.1957543697475;-97.6943677310934
