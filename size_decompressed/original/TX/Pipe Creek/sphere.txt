This is the First UFO we, the two of us have seen.  Wife was outside on phone in evening when she called me out to see these change lights in the sky.  We live north of San Antonio Texas in the rural hill country.   My wife was also visiting with her son on the phone as it was occurring.  What we saw were four white to gray orbs of considerable size  with each moving in a circular formation, following a pattern,  over and over, each at the same speed.  The location very close to our home.    After some time and as we were going to video, they went up and disappeared.  I wondered if what we saw was four separate units following rather same pattern as if chasing each other or if it was one large round unit we could not see with four power sources.  So change that there was no sound.   We are both bright, educated, mature individuals and neither of us has ever reported or seen anything like this.;29.6796;-98.946
