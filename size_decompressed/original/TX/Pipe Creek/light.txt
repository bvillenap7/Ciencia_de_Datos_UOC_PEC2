A bright light falling like a shooting star at halfspeed appeared in the sky southwest of San Antonio it hovered for a long time and i thought maybe my eyes had played a trick on me and that it was just a star or a planet i went back to what i was doing after a while i noticed it had moved froms its original location.   As i watched it it started to move out and then come back toward me. I went and got my binoculars and realized it had a red flame-like light originating from the bottom of the light and it would pulse.  I watched for a longwhile and showed my wife and a friend after a while it slowly faded off to the west and dissappeared.   There was no noise that i could hear and all the dogs in the area were barking the whole time. It was'nt a helicopter or a satilite or anything I've ever seen ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));29.6796;-98.946
