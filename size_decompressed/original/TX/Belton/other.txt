Square flying object with light on each corner flying very low and very slowly.;2009-12-09 18:25:00;10 minutes;Square flying object with light on each corner flying very low and very slowly. 9 December 2009  On this date at appx 6:25 p.m., while driving home from shopping, I saw an object moving in the sky.  It was flying very low and very slow.  It moved so slowly in relation to the speed of my car that I wondered if it was even moving at all.  I continued to track it and as I turned into my driveway it slowly disappeared from sight, going North,and having just cleared my house. I went into my house.  Then a couple of  minutes later, stepped back out my front door.  When I looked up, it was flying south, had just flown over my house and then disappeared from my sight. This object appeared flat on the bottom and was square-shaped.  There was a light on all four corners.  I head a low motor-type sound. Approximately 30-45 minutes later two helicopters passed over my house.  They passed over again a second time, appx another 20-30 minutes later. I live in Belton, Texas.  I am a Hospital Administrator, Masterâ€™s Degree, and retired Army MAJOR.;31.0735999999999;-97.4726999999995
Large house size flat white light (similar to Christmas lights on house) just above  horizon;2010-12-01 03:00:00;5 minutes;Large house size flat white light (similar to Christmas lights on house) just above  horizon I am now going go on record as having seen a UFO early this morning.  About 3:AM I was up performing my normal middle of the night routine when I decided to let the animals out in the cold as they would come right back in very quickly. As I looked out over the back pasture I could see what I then thought was the outline of a house with those white lights on it just below the tree tops..   I thought to myself then that I never realized that a house when lighted up could be seen at all through the trees. There were no clouds and the sky was very clear.  Due east and to the left was appeared to be a very bright star (maybe satellite) and several others could be seen.  That was a UFO, normal white lights, no blinking, no moving just stationery. After coming back about 30 minutes later to let the animals in, there were no lights.  I thought to myself, now why would anyone get up at 3:30 to turn off lights, maybe a timer.  When I got up this morning to see just what! house that could possibly be, I realized that there is no possibility of a house at that level.  That is straight into the sky as those trees are on top of a hill and nothing is visible for miles and miles if ever at that angle. This morning , there is no house, never could be, and never will be.  Nothing like any UFO I had read about but that was no illusion, not a mirage or some atmospheric phenomena. I did not take a picture, as it just did not impress me at all until this morning looking out to see where it was and to take note to go look at the house with Christmas lights in that area.;31.0735999999999;-97.4726999999995
