bright streak with explosion and continued streak;2005-11-04 20:30:00;ONLY ONE;bright streak with explosion and continued streak At a retreat in Belton, Texas, I went outside to get some fresh air.  In the dark night sky I saw a bright streak with a sudden explosion or flash and then the streak continued toward earth. Does anyone know if this was a military exercise from the nearby Killeen Military base or a falling star?;31.0735999999999;-97.4726999999995
