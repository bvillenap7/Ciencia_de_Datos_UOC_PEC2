Some red. Approximately 8-10 objects in a group transitioning south to north, possibly southeast to northwest. I would estimate them to be over 40,000ft. No contrails visible. Skies clear.  They were white objects. However, some flashed. It was more than likely sunlight reflecting because there was still daylight. Within the group of lights, two to three were red at times.  As they transitioned across, their speed was more so constant. However, several of the objects maneuvered faster in random directions.;31.0735999999999;-97.4726999999995
