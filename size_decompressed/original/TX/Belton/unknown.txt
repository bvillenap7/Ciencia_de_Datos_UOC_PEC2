Dozen or more  lights darting in and out of a thunderstorm;2003-05-16 07:45:00;45 mins;Dozen or more  lights darting in and out of a thunderstorm This happened right around dusk. I was in the house watching weather alerts on the television when my husband who was outside came to the door and said you've got to see this. We were under severe weather alerts at the time so I thought he was talking about all the lighting dancing around in the sky. When I got outside he just pointed to a large cloud formation with really high tops and he said watch there.  I looked up and at first I didn't see it, but then all these pin point white lights were darting in and out of the clouds.  Everytime you could see lighting flash inside the clouds these dots of light would zoom into the tops of the thunderstorm and then shoot back out.  It reminded me of a game of tag. There were so many of them.   Once, a plane came from the north (a passenger plane I think) and a light chased it for a few seconds then abruptly headed back to the clouds. This went on for a good 45 minutes.  The storm tracked to the south but stayed east of Interstate 35.   I was wondering if anyone else had seen what we had seen, but there were no reports anywhere.
