ANOTHER Bell County Sighting;2000-11-23 18:40:00;19:00;ANOTHER Bell County Sighting My husband and I were standing on our front porch looking into the south. He turned to me and said there is that light again. Meaning the one that had shown up three times during the course of the week. The light was intensely bright, and far off. The light would turn off, then on...zip to the right and back to its original place...then go left. IT seemed to be communicating with two other like objects. The communication was the bright one flashing its light as the other two. Then the two speed off from visibility. About 10 minutes into this two helicopters flew over the object, it turned sidways and we saw what looked like a bar of blue light on its sight and without warning the object burnt out. No trace of it... and the fact that there is not a tower, antenna or light source which could produce this light. It has only shown up over this week and does not move like a traditional aircraft would have to to not crash. This object and its two companions hover, sitting silently and still in the sky. The Bell County area is full of activity...a personal belief is that it has something to do with the fact that Fort Hood is located here. Near my grandmothers house, which is close to hwy 190, my family and strangers have observed MANY floating balls of light which seem to gather around a large microwave tower, maybe they are refueling?;31.0735999999999;-97.4726999999995
Bright object crossing sky from east to west and plane diverts to persue itâ€¦;2010-02-21 22:33:00;3-5 minutes;Bright object crossing sky from east to west and plane diverts to persue it... Tonight, i witnessed what i think is an unidentified object in the night sky.   I walked out to scare a cat in my yard and noticed an object moving acroos the southern sky in my front yard view, traveling from east to west.  A solid light going across the sky.  A second object was flying north to south and i knew was a plane because of the flashing undercarriage lights, and i the light appeared lower than the plane, as the grew close i noticed the plane turn to follow the object, staying behind it and above it as both crossed from east to west and dissapeared out of view over the tree line, the total duration was about three minutes....  This is my first report and i hope that i am taken seriously, i live approximately 10 miles from fort hood. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the individual who submitted this report, and he sounded both sincere, and sober-minded, in our opinion.  Satellites generally do not orbit to the west.  The witness was looking to the south, and the object moved from left to right, he reported.  PD));31.0735999999999;-97.4726999999995
