Triangular shaped object with the round white light's at each tip.;2011-06-03 23:30:00;30 seconds;Triangular shaped object with the round white light's at each tip. August 12th, 2011    National UFO Reporting Center   To whom it may concern,   The sighting being reported occurred on the night of June 3rd, 2011 at approximately 11:30p.m CST, in Belton TX. The following is a detailed account of what I witnessed on the night of June 3rd, 2011.  I am not claiming what I witnessed to be of alien origin, merely an object I could not identify.  I walked out on my porch that evening to get some fresh air.  When I looked up at the sky, I noticed an object to the east flying south to north at a high rate of speed.  The object was triangular in shape with three solid, what appeared as white round lights, at each tip.  The object itself wasnâ€™t visible, but appeared to blend in with the night sky.  Had it not been for the lights on the object, I most likely would not have noticed it.  I estimate that the object was visible for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared over the horizon.  I also noticed that it traveled at a consistent rate of speed. I am willing to answer any follow up questions that anyone may regarding this sighting.  My contact information is as follows.  I would prefer contact via email, but will conduct a phone interview if needed.;31.0735999999999;-97.4726999999995
