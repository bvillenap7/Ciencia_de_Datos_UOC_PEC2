Wednesday 26 November 2014 0530 a.m. I had just walked out the back door of my house to drive to work.  As I turned around after locking door, I noticed an odd light in northwest night sky, about 80 degrees above horizon, and about the size of a full moon.  The object was very dark with a faint amber golden light and appeared to be spinning.   The movement of this object did not appear to be a straight steady line but more of a gyrating motion as it moved away.  There was no sound, just the sighting which lasted about 15-20 seconds.   The sky was clear, winds from the southwest at about 8 m.p.h. and temperature about 48 degrees.;30.1745;-96.4016000000001
