My daughter and I had been sitting in the yard late Wednesday, July 26 night. something caught my eye and I looked up into the tree branches to see what it was.  There was a round red light seemingly from just beyond the branches.  It lasted for a couple of seconds and went out.  I looked back down at my daughter and she said what was that?  She said that there was a bright blue light shining on my face,that scanned down me and back up and went out. The time we figured was 11:20. There was no sound, we went into the street to look, we saw two multi-colored lighted objects in the distance across the sky from each other.  My daughter said she could see a red light traveling from one to the other.  I started to tell a friend about this, and before I said when, he asked if it had happened Wednesday night.  He had seen a bright greenish white light streak across the sky and turn down to the ground going in the direction of my house.  He had noted the time to be 11:15, Wednesday, July 26. He lives approximately 3 miles away.;30.1745;-96.4016000000001
