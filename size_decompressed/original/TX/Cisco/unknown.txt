Strange set of lights slowly traveling across the sky then disappearing;2020-03-25 20:55:00;5 seconds;Strange set of lights slowly traveling across the sky then disappearing At approximately 2055 CST as I was driving on a dark country road, I saw in the sky a bright red/orange colored light that slowly turned on and slowly turned off 4-5 times, then stopped completely and slowly traveled in a complete straight line across the sky. The mysterious lights appeared out of nowhere and it happened in two different sets of 4-5 slow flickers, each coming on as if they were on a set timer.  What was absolutely shocking to me is that one set of the flickers appeared to go from south to north and the other set happened from north to south in the same timer pattern, same straight line pattern and same amount of flickers.  I cannot explain what the mysterious lights were as they were too high to be someone from the ground lighting something like a firework and the fact that the direction in which the lights headed were a straight line pattern going across the sky, not up and down. No sounds were heard and did not see any planes in the sky.  Tr ed to capture video evidence of lights but was too late.;32.3732;-98.9869
