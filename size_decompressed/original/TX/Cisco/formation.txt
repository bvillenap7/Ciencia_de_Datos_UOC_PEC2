Series of amber lights, seemed to be rotating and very large.;2008-10-23 20:40:00;1 minute;Series of amber lights, seemed to be rotating and very large. At 8:40 pm on October 23, 2008 My husband and I went outside to see what our dog was barking at, and in the south-eastern sky there were a series of orange/amber lights in a line.  I don't know exactly how many there were at one time, because as the one on the end would fade out one on the opposite side would fade in at the same rate.  Last fall, if I remember correctly, my brother-in-law had seen this same thing and reported it the night he saw it.  He was contacted by someone about his report,  So he told me to report this right away.  My brother-in-law reported what he saw as very small and that he could hold his fist out in front of him and completely cover the lights.  However, what we saw was very large.  I could tell this because we have a large hill on our property and the lights spanned further then our hill did, if that makes sense.   It didn't seem to be moving in any particular direction, but the way that one light would fade and another would appear at the opposite end leads me to believe that it was spinning or rotating.  One more thing, my brother-in-laws sighting was reported the night before the Stephenville, Texas, UFO sightings broke news. Hope to hear back form someone  Thanks,  ((name deleted));32.3732;-98.9869
4-6 orange/amber lights  fading in and out;2008-10-30 20:45:00;30 secs;4-6 orange/amber lights  fading in and out This is the third sighting and third report I have made through this website. The first was back in Febuary, the second was about 1 week ago (october the 23 or around there). The first was seen by myself, the second by my sister-in-law and brother, this sighting by myself and my brother. 4-6 Orange/amber lights in the southeastern sky in a line. As the light on the far right would fade away, another light on the far left of the formation would fade in at the same rate, as if it were spinning. It did this for about 30 seconds then all lights faded out one at a time. Thanks so much ((name deleted));32.3732;-98.9869
