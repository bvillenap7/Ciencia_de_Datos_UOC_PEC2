UFO sighting South of  Dallas/Ft Worth at 19:35 on 19 Oct 2007;2007-10-19 19:35:00;40 sec;UFO sighting South of  Dallas/Ft Worth at 19:35 on 19 Oct 2007 While walking in our neighborhood last evening, my wife said look at that!   As she pointed to the sky to the south, I looked up, and saw, what appeared to be a meteorite coming down into the atmosphere.  It looked like a comet.   It appeared to descend into our atmosphere at a high rate of speed, then about one fist above the horizon it broke into 3 distinct objects about equal distance apart, emitting a bright white light.   The 3 objects became stationary in the sky, and slowly I lost sight as they drifted beyond my line of sight.   Appeared to be south of Dallas/Ft Worth in the sky.   Any aircrew flying into or out of DFW airport at this time may have seen this event.   I am a retired fighter pilot, and currently a pilot for American Airlines.   I have dropped flares at night to illuminate target areas, and this was nothing like this!   What's up?  Did anyone else see this?;33.0198999999999;-97.2129999999998
