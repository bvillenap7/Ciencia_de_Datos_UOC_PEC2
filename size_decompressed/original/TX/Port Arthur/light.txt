Group of fast moving lights inthe night sky.;2011-09-30 22:30:00;15 seconds;Group of fast moving lights inthe night sky. Approximately 10:30 pm September 30th 2011, while relaxing under my carport admiring the night sky, I had focused on the typical passing airliner at high altitude with it's red and white lights moving slow in a westerly direction. Suddenly six oval shaped glowing amber lights in a very tight semi-delta formation appeared in my vision as if they had shot out of the clouds and just appeared moving fast in a southwesterly direction. My immediate thought was Cool, fighter jets! However there was absolutely no noise and no jets, just the glowing lights. If they were jets, they would have been flying low to be going that fast and making a lot of noise. A single fighter makes allot of noise flying over my area at even higher attitudes, also the airliner that I was first watching was at a much greater altitude and I could make out a faint sound from it. The formation of the lights first reminded me of the Phoenix lights, but much tighter however the last three of the lights were slightly out of a perfect delta formation, at least from my vantage point. That gave me the impression that I was seeing six individual objects or lights as oppose to a possible single object with six lights. They moved very fast towards Galveston Texas. I watched until they were out of sight. The duration of the event was maybe 10 to 15 seconds. Unless I was witness to a squadron of classified visually and audibly stealth fighters, I am not yet convinced that I was viewing jets with their afterburners on as others have suggested.;29.9148344;-93.9275319999999
