As I scanned the sky I saw 4 more in  no particular formation.   The objects were not visible to the naked eye.  I was using 15x80 Steiner German Military binoculars.  I moved to the side of my house where numerous neighbors were outside.  We all witnessed the objects through the binoculars.  For brief moments they were visible to one person with polarized glasses as if the sun reflected off the objects.  Some were stationary as others moved.  The number increased greatly to around 20 with some glowing green then disappeared.  They resembled rockets with colored lights on each end.;29.9148344;-93.9275319999999
