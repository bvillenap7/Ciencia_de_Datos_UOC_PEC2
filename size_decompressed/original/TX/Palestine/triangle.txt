On 01/14/2014 at approximately 0600 hours and in the town of Palestine, Anderson County, Texas, a strange aircraft was observed in the dark sky.  From a distance it was thought to be the lights of a tower of some kind. It had two bright green lights facing downward and one red flashing light.  Getting closer to the object revealed that it was moving.  Once the object was directly above, it seemed to have a long triangular shape to it like the shape of a single wing.  The object was at a very low altitude and had a choppy sound like rotor blades but was not loud like a helicopter.  The size was maybe fifteen to twenty feet in length and appeared to be black in color.  The object was watched for approximately three to five minutes do to the witness driving to his place of employment. The witness has previously lived next to the Fort Hood Army base for approximately twenty years and witnessed various types of aircraft and never saw one that was similar to this object. A possible explanation might be a drone of some sort.  However, a search conducted of drone photos did not reveal anything similar to the object that was observed on this date.;31.7584225806452;-95.6487354838709
