Small orangish red pulsating object moving slowly from West to East across the night sky;2001-02-06 22:15:00;5 minutes;Small orangish red pulsating object moving slowly from West to East across the night sky From Palestine, Texas, facing North, looking towards Tyler, Texas, I saw a small red light which pulsated slowly from a dim red to a bright red, continuously, traveling in an Easterly direction towards Jacksonville, Texas.  It's speed was rather slow, like a conventional aircraft, however it moved in the form of an arc across the sky, then proceeded Eastbound.  The intensity of the light was still bright even when it was several miles away.  I could not make out a shape of the object, other than that remembled a round orb.  There was no sound from this object, either. End of Statement;31.7584225806452;-95.6487354838709
Bright lights continually making the sign of the cross;2003-12-15 22:00:00;1 hour;Bright lights continually making the sign of the cross We went out to look at Mars about 2 days from when it was closest to the earth.  It was out in the country, very dark, and as I was looking at constellations I turned around to the west and I saw a bright light bigger than a star and going horizontally and then vertically like when people make the sign of the cross and it continued to do that until I went into the house. There was an aura or a haze around it. The next day I heard on the television as I was walking thru the house that a UFO sighting was made in Lake _________, California.  If anyone knows anything about this, please put the info on this site. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));31.7584225806452;-95.6487354838709
