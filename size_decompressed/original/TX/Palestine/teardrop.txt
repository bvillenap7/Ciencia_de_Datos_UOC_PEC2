Teardrop orbs near in the Pineywoods of State Highway 294 in East Texas.;2008-08-01 01:31:00;3 Minutes;Teardrop orbs near in the Pineywoods of State Highway 294 in East Texas. I was driving back to Palestine, Texas from Alto, Texas down State Highway 294 and I saw a bright orange light that changed to green and then blue in the pine forest to my left.  It had a color changing sequence and was moving slowly in the forest near Dennison Springs.   It picked up speed as I passed and kept up with me and my friend which was approximately 65 mph.  Then my friend shouted to look to the right and on the righthand side a similar object was traveling beside us.  We stopped to take a picture on our cell phones and both objects that were in the pine forest to our left and right arced into the sky, trailed each other and made a Z zig-zag pattern off into the sky straight up until we could no longer see them at a high rate of speed.  I am college educated with a Master of Science degree and not easily discredited, my friend is United States Coast Guard active duty.  We are not your run of the mill country bumpkins and have never experienced anything like this.....;31.7584225806452;-95.6487354838709
