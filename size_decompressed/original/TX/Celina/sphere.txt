Silent Orange Sphere without Landing Lights.;2013-09-06 00:48:00;15 minutes;Silent Orange Sphere without Landing Lights I was out walking down a country road doing my usual stargazing, when I caught sight of a pale orange sphere shaped object that was moving in a northeast to  southwest direction. This object/craft was perfectly silent as it passed overhead, (it was at least 5,000 feet up).   I kept watching for those telltale blinking landinng lights, but I never did see any.  This object flew over to the western horizon and then vanished out of my sight.   It seems strange that I never heard any jet, or regular plane engine noise when it flew over me, but I never did.;33.3103;-96.7673
