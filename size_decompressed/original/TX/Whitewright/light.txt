Three of us were sitting on our porch enjoying the coolness of the evening when my son looking at the stars asked What's that? Looking up I said jokingly The Milky Way. He stated No,mom that star, look it's moving At that point I seen it too. It was moving quite fast to the south and very high. It looked like a star but not fast like a shooting star, then my husband seen it. It would almost stop, then shoot off again. We watched it move to a point near a stationary star then stop. Then we watched another leave just south of that one and head north, it moved slow then faster, then two more from the north to the south. They looked like stars at first then moved to specific points. I joked at one because it moved in a jerky pattern not smooth like the others. I said it must be Santa Clause testing new equipment They all traveled down the milky way. Then two others moved back up to the north. Were they satellites being repositioned? It was like watching the changing of the guards.;33.5203;-96.4518
