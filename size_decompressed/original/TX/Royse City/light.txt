Texas incidents.;2015-06-26 03:48:00;4 hours;Texas incidents My boyfriend and I, were having a bonfire on my back yard on the side of the house.  We stayed outside all night, gazing at the stars and talkin about life.  I pointed at a star and told my boyfriend that it was a bright star.  As I pointed it out, it started zig zagging.  Then it stopped and just hovered over my neighbor's house.  That's when we knew it was a UFO.  It was about 300 ft in the sky, I felt like they were observing us.   Around 4:00am they left, I could see the direction of where the light was going to, until it disappeared.  That's was the first time that I have ever seen a UFO. After that incident, I started having nightmares.  Every time I would wake up in the middle of the night the time would be 3:48a.  When I woke up, I felt a presence in the room, but nobody was there.  I started looking online and doing some research.  I ran across a woman who had the same experence, except she remembers going into their ship. One day, I was walkimg, and I felt an object on my finger under the skin.  I'm very scared to let a doctor see it, because I don't even want to know what it is that's why I haven't.  That is my experience with the abduction.   I hope this helps anyone who is battling with being abducted. Thank you!;32.9628;-96.3647999999998
