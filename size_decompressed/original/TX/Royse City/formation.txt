Two reddish/orange lights seen moving slowly and stopping outright on the horizon.;2012-04-22 20:45:00;10 mintues;Two reddish/orange lights seen moving slowly and stopping outright on the horizon. Me and my girlfriend were stargazing on the hood of my car outside tonight in Royse City, TX, a little further out from Dallas, deep in the countryside. We saw Mars and Venus, plenty of stars, and a couple airplanes   But what kind of creeped us out were two reddish lights that we saw on the horizon, exactly South, after sitting up on my car.  They were flickering, so we knew they weren't planets, and they were too reddish-orange to be stars.  I pulled out my phone and pulled up Google Sky maps and there was nothing similar in that area of the sky. They were lined up and spaced apart, so we thought they might be radio towers or something, and we ignored them. About 2 minutes later, she gasped and pointed.  They had not only moved, but were very noticable now, flickering between orange and red.  We kept a close eye on them, and they began to move towards each other, and they almost traded places, since they were moving straight, i thought they were planes, but one gradually slowed down and stopped again, while one kept moving, but slowing as well. I walked her back to her house, and when i went back to my car and looked, they were both stopped, and noticeably smaller. I marked it off as helicopters or something, and drove home. I didn't notice it again, but i thought it'd be worth it to look around on the internet, and bang, i see videos posted within the last week that look EXACTLY like what we saw. We only saw two lights, though, while most of the videos have 4+;32.9628;-96.3647999999998
