Low and slow in the Houston night sky.;2002-12-19 19:00:00;30 seconds;Low and slow in the Houston night sky. The object appeared to be 1 to several thousand feet high, moving slowly without any noise. Shape was chevron with orange lights highligting the shape. It was a clear night sky and the orange lights were very, very dim and the craft did not stay in view very long. If the object were actually high in the sky, it would have been an enormous object. This occured while my 5 year old son was looking at the stars and wanted to know what that was. At first I did not see it but then I noticed the shape blocking the light of the stars. I am an ex-USAF pilot having flown the C-141B all over the world. This is my first experience with something I can't explain.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
