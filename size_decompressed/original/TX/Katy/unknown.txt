Two rows of three. Crafts hovering and slowly dissapear into the night. Red lights.;2009-05-24 21:30:00;10-20 minutes;Two rows of three. Crafts hovering and slowly dissapear into the night. Red lights. At 9:30 PM,There was six crafts hovering  very very slowly in the distance  and it didnt look like they were heading in any particular direction.They were hovering around and stayed in the same area. They were in a sort of rectangle shape in two rows of three. I really could not see the shape of the crafts moving but it looked disk shaped but they had bright red lights. To me it looked like there was diagnal lines on the crafts. I know for a fact that these were not planes because they stayed in the same spot for a while and when planes pass by you would hear a noise, these were silent. Three of them faded away and the rest started to dissapear shortly after until there was only one left and it to, dissapeared. It looked as if they went into clouds. I could not see much detail but I know that what I saw were UFO's and I wasn't the only person to see them either. Two of my cousins were there. I tried to video tape it and take pictures from my phone, but it was way to dark and the pictures were just black. I also tried to call the ufo center and they accused me of being a prank caller and didn't even give me a chance to describe what I saw. I really could care less if anyone believes me or my cousins because we know what we saw.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763

As I was leaving a restaurant in the La Centera shopping area in Katy, I noticed two greenish bluish lights.  The lights appeared to be traveling unusually low to the ground at a speed which seemed in excess of what any plane or jet could achieve.   Couldn't tell if it was one or two crafts.  Two other persons (daughter and father perhaps, I did not know them) walking in the parking lot also saw same lights and also thought the lights were very strange they remarked how it could not be a shooting star.  The way it was traveling low and fast with no sound was somewhat unsettling, particularly in contrast to the airplanes and jets which frequently fly through this area.
