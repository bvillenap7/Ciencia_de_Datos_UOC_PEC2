At Approx 21:30 I saw a green fireball with a long tail streak across the sky from north to south. At first I thought it was a meteor but it took too long to cross the sky approx 4 seconds. Clear skies lots of stars not much light pollution. Like stated above, I at first thought of a meteor, but I had time to glance down the road to my front a couple of times and still look out my side window and still see the green fireball moving across the sky. It was moving very fast but not nearly as fast as one would imagin a meteor would.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
looked like a really BIG .. long lasting.. blue/green shooting star.  appeared from top of my windshield and vanished in the distance.;1999-12-15 19:00:00;aprox. 8 seconds;looked like a really BIG .. long lasting.. blue/green shooting star.  appeared from top of my windshield and vanished in the distance. From the top of my windshield appeared a blue and green ball of fire/light.   it streaked forward (in the direction i was driving) for about 8-9 seconds and disappeared.   i DO know that there was a meteor shower a couple of weeks before this occurence, so i guess it may be possible that it was a meteor of some sort i don't know.  it just seemed like a really wierd meteor if it actually was one at all.   it didn't go very fast, it was night outside, so i'm guessing it was about as fast as a jet maybe.   and it seemingly lasted quite a bit longer than any shooting star I'VE ever seen.   in anycase, i thought it very unusual and worth reporting.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
Glowing fireball going through night sky;2012-11-13 19:55:00;30 seconds;Glowing fireball going through night sky My wife and I were outside playing with the dogs when I noticed an orange ball of light ascending through the air from the North aky. I called attention to it because it looked as if a plane were on fire in the air but had none of the colored directional lights typically seen on aircraft at night. The object moved relatively slowly to the South and the fire seemed to grow and then get smaller while flying through the air (just like a fire would in a fireplace). We could not make out any kind of shape for the flying object, but there was definitely fire.  We heard no sound accompanying this craft. After about 30 seconds, the object seemed to disappear or just fly out of sight.  We are not crazy people and are not implying the existence of UFOs from other planets, etc. I found this sight while trying to find out if there was a plane on fire in the area but after reading a few other similar accounts, felt like it made sense to share this sighting in hopes of an explanation.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
Fireball seen moving across the sky of Katie, Texas. .;2013-10-25 20:15:00;3 minutes;Fireball seen moving across the sky of Katie, Texas. . We had just walked out of our home to say good bye to some friends, and as they drive off I noticed a fireball in the northern sky moving South West.  At first the fire looked like something you would see in a hot air ballon, but there was no sign of any ballon, however it was dark.  But the object was moving way too fast to be a hot air ballon. After about 3 minutes and traveling across the the sky the light suddenly disappeared.  There was also noise to be heard.  Looked very similar to some videos we just now search on You-Tube of UFO's over Katy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

6-7 lights in night sky moving from the west, some grouped, some slowly dropping to ground or moving northward and then disappearing.;2014-08-10 23:00:00;3-5 minutes;6-7 lights in night sky moving from the west, some grouped, some slowly dropping to ground or moving northward and then disappearing. Saw multiple lights in sky all coming from one direction, thought at first airplanes or military helicopters, but no noise.  The lights on the ones we saw close up to us, did not appear to be planes or helicopter lights, too bright (red and white).  They all came in from the West, moving slowly, then seeming to float around, and then headed northward or slowly descending downward to land.  Either they disappeared into night sky behind clouds or dropped to ground, stayed lit for a few seconds, and then light disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides little contact information.
