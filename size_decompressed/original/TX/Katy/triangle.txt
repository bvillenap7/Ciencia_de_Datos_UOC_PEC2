Black triangle over Katy Texas in mid 1980s.;1985-06-30 18:00:00;1+ hour;Black triangle over Katy Texas in mid 1980s In summer of 1985 or 86 my teenaged son and I noticed a white light in the sky about a mile away from our house  that was blinking slowly, but motionless in the dusk sky.  My husband looked but thought it must be a plane, so my son and I got in the car and drove to get near it and saw it was hovering very low in the sky perfectly still, noiseless.  We could see it was a black perfect triangle, and had a white blinking light underneath at each corner blinking in unison.   Many others on a school parking lot nearby were also watching it.  A jogger said he had ran the block 3 times and it had not moved.  My son and i rushed home to get my husband and our 8 inch reflector telescope to view it better.  When we came back the sky was dark, but the thing was still stationary, hanging there. We were almost directly underneath it, and set up the scope on the field grass.  The instant I got my eye on the viewer the lights all went off on it, just like someone flipped the switch off.  It was very eerie,  but after our eyes adjusted to the darkness in the viewfinder we could see the color seemed to be flat black or dark flat gunmetal gray.  It also seemed to not be featureless on the bottom but to have an undulating or webbed appearance.  After awhile, the telescope began to reveal that it was very softly glowing orange, like coals that are almost burned out.  (You could not see it at all naked eye against the dark sky)    We all watched it hang there over us for most of an hour and it never budged.   Mosquitoes were biting and it was hot, so we finally left it there suspended in the dark. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
My son and I watched a triangular shaped craft several thousand feet in the air that remained stationary but rotated or gyrated.;2006-11-24 13:30:00;15 minutes;My son and I watched a triangular shaped craft several thousand feet in the air that remained stationary but rotated or gyrated. My son and I were hanging Christmas lights on the outside of his house.  I was holding the ladder while he was securing the lights on the gutter around his front door. The sky was clear except for a few high level clouds.  I heard a passenger jet flying overhead and looked up to see it pass.  The part of the sky I was looking at was framed by the house structure so when I looked up I only had a brief sighting of the jet but my eye suddenly caught the outline of some other kind of craft that appeared to be much higher than the jet I had just seen.  I looked at it for a second not knowing what it was but trying to identify it.  As I was watching it, it remained stationary but appeared to rotate or move constantly in one place.  As it moved or rotated I could see that it was triangular, in appearance.  I asked my son if he saw it and he said yes.  He, at first, thought it was a satellite, star or a planet but after watching it for awhile, we both noticed it wasn't moving across the sky.  Unfortunately, we didn't have any binoculars or other means to view it any closer. I asked him how he would describe it and he said it looked either triangular or rectangular.  We both looked away for a few minutes to gather some other lights to hang on the house and when we looked up to view the object again, it had vanished.  We could not locate the object again.  I remember commenting to my son that if it had been a satellite or planet, it wouldn't have simply vanished.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
Black triangle flying low and slow;2007-10-13 07:45:00;5 seconds;Black triangle flying low and slow It was dusk I was walking from my garage to my  house not far away something caught my eye to the right above a palm tree about 25 feet away and about 30 feet tall.  The object was 7 to 10 feet above the palm it was flying in a flight path that aircraft use all day.  I thought it was a helicopter because it was flying low and seemed large, but it was not.  I stopped in my tracks and it flew right over me and have never seen anything like this before. It was a black triangle with 3 white lights one in each tip and a smaller red light in the center, this thing made no noise but I felt like I could feel, more of a since of something rather hearing it.  It was very low and as I watched it fly over and passed me I didnâ€™t see any sign of a engine. I had no Idea of what I saw I remember hearing abut the upcoming air show so I assumed that it was a stealth bomber.  I mentioned this to my neighbor and he said it was a B1 bomber so I looked it up Sunday only to discover that is was a UFO that I saw.

Very large thin gliding grey triangular object with no lights and no sound.;2011-11-03 21:05:00;30 seconds;Very large thin gliding grey triangular object with no lights and no sound. I went outside to walk my dog and happened to notice a very large triangular grey object gliding low in the night sky.  There were no lights and no sound.  I initially thought it must be birds (it was heading from north to south), but then I realized that I could see it very clearly and it was one solid object.  It appeared to have something in the center.  The only way I can describe it would be to say it had a couple of medium length thin tassles trailing the middle portion.

Three star looking lights in a triangular shape move accross the sky in a fairly fast pace.;2012-04-19 20:00:00;1-2 minutes;Three star looking lights in a triangular shape move accross the sky in a fairly fast pace. I went outside with my flashlight to look at the stars when I looked up I saw lights - 3 in a triangle shape travel in a group across the sky going in a constent speed but the speed was faster than an airplane.  It seemed like it was floating across the sky and it was silent.  It went across the sky fairly fast. It didn't look like it was a plane since I saw planes moving with their usual blinking lights.  This object was triangular in shapt with three lights.  I could not see an outline of the craft.  Could it be the space station?  It looked like three stars moving in unison.  I did not take any pictures.  I live in Katy Texas about 25 miles west of Houston.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
Black, triangular shaped craft with dim, orange lights over Katy, Tx;2012-10-19 20:35:00;15-20 seconds;Black, triangular shaped craft with dim, orange lights over Katy, Tx My wife and I were eating dinner on our back patio, and had been out there for approximately an hour and a half when we observed an object fly silently from north to south over our backyard. I initially observed it out of the corner of my eye while looking northeast  and conversing with her. I pointed it out to her and we watched it until it disappeared. In the last 5 seconds of viewing it appeared to have folded its wings back in a similar manner to various military aircraft, although its speed was not affected by this maneuver. It was triangular in shape, with the length (from nose to tail) of the craft being approximately 1/3 of the width (wingspan). Additionally, the main body appeared to be black with what seemed like a dozen or so orangish reflectors, or dimly lit lights, symmetrically dispersed on the underside of the body. While our depth perception was scewed due to the darkness, I would estimate it having been around 1,000 ft above ground level. From that  altitude, I would guess its wingspan to have been approximately 80ft. It flew at a consistent speed, and we viewed it for around 15 to 20 seconds prior to it flying out of eyesight. Our approximate viewing area was a total of 115 degrees out of 180 (horizon to horizon). It is difficult to describe strictly in words, but it dissappeared from our eyesight prior to reaching an obstacle that would have naturally inhibited our viewing of the craft (i.e. it simply faded away as opposed to flying behind the adjacent house). The night here has been crystal clear and we have experienced very little wind that may have kicked up dust. Our backyard and patio faces the east, with our two story house blocking any view of the west (including the moon at the time of viewing). We live in a typical Katy, Tx subdivision, so there is a certain amount of ambient light. However, we enjoy the relatively quiet evenings of the neighborhood on our patio with the lights off, which gives us as good of a view as we can get of the stars. I mention these facts only to emphasize that we had a clear view of the craft against a black sky background. As far as explinations, there is skydiving in our area but, as a skydiver, this was not a parachute. We have motorized paragliders in the area as well, but this was certainly not that either as there was no noise nor a parachute of any kind. We have a small airport near our house, but we watch those aircraft come and go everyday(and night), and this was neither on the proper heading, nor did it have the physical attributes of the planes that fly in and out of there. Hang gliding is highly unlikely as there are no elevated areas to start from, and the size of the craft and time of day would not make sense, in addition to the perceived speed. I am not necessarily a believer in alien UFOs, however I cannot explain what we saw tonight. I pride myself on my logical way of thinking and having a healthy skeptisism of many things in life. I am a (former) Marine infantry squad leader who left the Corps about 4 years ago with an impeccable service record at the rank of Seargent (E-5), and have since had a solid professional career. My wife is a teacher working on her Masters degree with plans to persue a doctorate. I do not wear a tin foil hat. I have scoffed at many on the news and Discovery Channel for claiming to have experienced similar things. I am not overwhelmed by what I saw i am just simply trying to find an explanation. For the record, I do not claim what we saw was was either extraterrestrial or governmental.  I only claim to have seen something over our house that neither my wife nor I can logically identify based on our own experiences and knowledge.  Take it as you will.

There were about 7-8 very dim lights in a line in the middle of the thing. There were other lights next to the primary line that constantly changing like a code.  It made no sound and was a bit higher than the regular helicopter flight.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
