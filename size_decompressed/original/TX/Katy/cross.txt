Multiple cross shaped crafts over Katy, TX with almost no sound;2011-03-02 19:15:00;1 hour plus;Multiple cross shaped crafts over Katy, TX with almost no sound Tonight 3/2/11 over the sky's of Katy, TX from approximately 715 PM up to now 8:12 PM near the intersection of I-10 and Fry Road my family including myself, my friend in another vehicle and my brother in yet another vehicle observed approximately 30 or so oddly shaped crafts approaching from the west many of them were hovering and some flying in a square and candy cane formation. Others were observed flying independently North and South of 1-10 mainly between Fry Rd and Mason road. One craft flew directly over my wife's vehicle and she put her head out the window and heard a tiny swoosh sound. We then came home and watched the crafts appear spontaneously in the sky over our backyard at a rate of 1-2 craft every five minutes. The craft actually looked like fighter jets from the 50's and 60's but seemed to have a circular formation around them and pulsing red and green lights and a yellowish orange light that remained constant. The body of the craft also seemed to concave upwardly and outwardly like an upside down pyramid but much more subtle.  The white/off white jet fighter part of the craft(s) looked to have a very fat fuselage and had a very distinctive cross shape.  It was hard to see the circular part of the craft but you could see that it extended out from the main body and was much darker in color.  One would think it was a normal aircraft other than the fact that some of them seemed to sit still and no more than the minor swoosh sound could be heard. One thing that really stuck out is that they just kept coming from the west almost like bombers on a test run, many of them continued into Houston and some seemed to disappear. My first thought was that this could be some type of Harrier craft of even a type of silent helicopter but nothing really added up. I have never seen anything like it. We (my family) watched them for about an hour, checked the news reports, made a few calls and really found no explanation.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
