egg shaped metalic object viewed over Katy, Tx in 1978;1978-06-01 13:00:00;1 minute;egg shaped metalic object viewed over Katy, Tx in 1978 It was a bright sunny day when I noticed an egg shaped metalic object moving slowly in the sky.  It did not seem too high (maybe 200 to 300 feet) and it appeared to be 8 to 10 feet in diameter.  It was definitely metalic with no seams or rivets.. totally smooth skinned.  As it approached my neighbor and me overhead it suddenly stopped for a moment and then it changed direction taking a 90 degree turn and it slowly moved away out of sight.   This was not a ballon or anything like that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
