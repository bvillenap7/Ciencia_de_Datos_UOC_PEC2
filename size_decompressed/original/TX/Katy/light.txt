UFO sighting in North Houston, TX;2005-04-13 21:30:00;15 seconds;UFO sighting in North Houston, TX The balcony of my apartment has a dirct, unobstructed view of the quadrant from due West to due North.   At approximately 21:30 on April 13, 2005, I witnessed what appeared to be a typical aircraft light moving from West to East at estimated normal aircraft speed.  The light stopped its forward progress at the approximate NNW direction from my balcony, and seemed to hover for a couple of seconds.  It then abruptly soared upward at a fast rate of speed, then shot straight forward rapidly from West to East.  It hesitated again, momentarily, then the light disappeared.  A few seconds later, at least three normal aircraft appeared in the sky (their lights relatively identifiable), traveling in a gerneral East - West direction.  The object in question did not reappear.  Due to the darkness, and the absence of aerial refernce points, I could not estimate the object's distance from my location, nor its altitude.  I do know, however, that I have never witnessed an airborne object moving so erratically.  And, no, I was not under the influence at the time.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
Strange bright lights in sky over rural area in Katy Texas.;2005-11-28 18:00:00;2 hrs 30 min.;Strange bright lights in sky over rural area in Katy Texas. At approximately 6:00 PM at our apartment balcony, my mother and I saw what we thought was a very bright star in the sky.(**We have been seeing this light for several consecutive nights now**). At first my mother thought it was the North Star, but then we realized that the light was in the Western sky. We began to look at it more closely, and to our amazement, it appeared to be slowly shifting back and forth as well as downward.At this point we decided to look at it through our binoculars. The light appeared through the binoculars to be a bright white light at first , but as it slowly descended, the color changed to more of a yellow light near the bottom, with a definite red light near the side, and a faint blue light on top.  We continued to watch this light for over 2 hours as it slowly descended from high in the sky, to just above the tree tops. At this point we decided to get in the car to get a better view before it disappeared behind the trees. As we traveled down the  road we kept looking up to try to find the light. At first we couldn't see it, so we thought we had passed it because of the trees blocking our view. We then turned around, went back up the road, and saw the light, so we decided to turn on a side road to get a better view. We pulled off the side of the road to look at it. After looking at it for only a few seconds, the light quickly faded out followed by several red blinks of light, and then nothing.  At this point another bright light caught our attention in the Southeastern sky. We quickly took out the binoculars to get a better look at it. To our amazement the lights were the same as the lights we had witnessed previously. We then drove back home, keeping our eyes on the light. When we got home, we got out of the car, and looked at the sky in the same direction and there it was. At this point, another bright light caught our attention directly above us  that was even brighter and closer. We looked at it through the binoculars and saw that it had the same type of lights. As we gazed at the night sky we spotted 5 more of these strange lights throughout the sky.  *It should be noted that these lights at first glance appear to be bright stars. Only after careful observation does one notice that these lights are not stars.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
Circular light seen  possible close by and then further away during morning.;2007-01-10 06:43:00;2 minutes;Circular light seen  possible close by and then further away during morning. Witness age 12 was sitting at breakfast table and observed a light through the window blinds. This was in a East direction. She had sat there many times before without seeing lights.  On this occasion, the light caught her attention.  Light appeared as a Yellow White light that was stationary.   Witness moved head while sitting to get a better view throught the window blinds. The blinds were about 1/3 to 1/2 open at the time.  The witness said the object was above the one story building next door.  It sat stationary for 15 seconds then it took off in northernly direction in a diagonal upward direction.  It was gone within 1 sec and the observer stated the light left a visual trail during that departure.  Possible visual after-effect.  Witness claims no head movement during this departure sequence as best as she could remember.   The witness reported no change in the size or shape during the entire visual encounter.  Object remained circular in shape and witness describes as a light shinning at you appearance.  This description was further clarified by the witness as a briht center with rays of light all around it.  Her impression was that this object was close and it was estimated to be about 300 feet away and about 25 ft above the ground and about 2 ft in diameter based on similar size objects like a fan on a trailer nearby at the same distance but only 8 ft off the ground.  The witness then went up to the window to open the blinds futher and then looked and saw nothing more for one minute.  The same color light was seen again toward the southeast but appeared smaller (about a bbsize at arms length) and assumed to be further away and still above the building. This light was stationary for two seconds and then just blinked out.   No other objects seen after this.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763

Katy Texas Ufo sighting involving fighter jets;2010-10-29 18:00:00;2 minutes;Katy Texas Ufo sighting involving fighter jets I was sitting in the backyard with my girlfriend around the fire pit. She went to the restroom so I started staring at the clear sky, it's completely clear out today.   About 700 yards away I saw the brightest light I've ever seen in the daytime sky.  It moved across the sky instantly and it was at this point I'm screaming for my girlfriend to come outside out of the restroom.  It moved to the edge of where I could see in about 10 seconds started blinking and for about 5 seconds blinked very bright and then disappeared.   Finally my girlfriend makes it to the door to see it do the blinking thing then just was goneâ€¦ About 1 minute later we saw a cigar shaped craft that was able to move very quickly also.  It wasn't as bright and you could actually make out the shape, it was moving so quick by the time we got the camera the cigar had blinked out too.   About 2 minutes later there were 3 fighter jets that appeared in the sky that were circling where we saw them both.  I know the difference and you can tell very easily planes from different things and these two freaked me out.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763

Strange red UFO seen over Katy Mills mall during firework show.;2014-07-04 21:30:00;unsure;Strange red UFO seen over Katy Mills mall during firework show. Before the firework show ended at the Katy Mills mall, my dad pointed out a red light in the direction of the fireworks. There was no sound nor was it moving, but then it began to go higher into the sky. Just as the fireworks ended it moved to the left and changed from red to blue and then white. It quickly sped off behind the clouds of smoke from the fireworks and disappeared.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
Object with red and green light seemed to be observing fireworks show in Katy mills mall, Katy TX on July 4th, 2014.;2014-07-04 21:30:00;20;Object with red and green light seemed to be observing fireworks show in Katy mills mall, Katy TX on July 4th, 2014 There was a fireworks show at Katy Mills Mall, Katy, TX, on July 4th, 2014.  Fireworks started at 21:20.   Soon an object showed up close to the fireworks and hoovering  there, seems like it was observing the fireworks.  The object has red and green light.  Red light was always on, green light was blinking.   It was hovering still there most of time.  It made some adjustment according to where fireworks explode sometime.   It is hard to judge the height go the object in the dark, but seems to me it was at about a little higher than the fireworks can reach.  There were thousands of people there.  People near my family saw it too.   Once the fireworks finished, it left to north of I10 direction.  It moved very fast, much faster than a helicopter.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
Brief two second sighting of bright red light traversing the sky at low altitude in a crescent shape trajectory.;2021-05-31 18:00:00;1 or 2 seconds;Brief two second sighting of bright red light traversing the sky at low altitude in a crescent shape trajectory. I was walking out my front door heading north toward my truck parked in front on the street.. midway approximately 10feet from my truck and 15 feet from my house, I stopped and turned my head around and looked up at the sky above my house. I don't remember why I stopped, perhaps I wanted to see if there were any rain clouds in the sky, but I'm not totally convinced that was the case. The moment I set my eyes on the sky a bright red light appeared at what seemed a very low altitude (maybe 750-1500ft, it appeared close to me rather than far and large) and traversed the sky in a crescent shape-like trajectory for a second or two and disappeared. My vantage point was limited by trees and my house (two-story) so I'm not sure if it reappeared. However my sighting was not obfuscated by trees or anything else I had a clear view of what little I did see. It definitely-absolutely was not an airplane or drone, there is an airport 8 miles northeast from my home and jet! s often/hourly pass over my home. Also, two international airports are further away, both about 40-45 miles away, one to the southeast and one to the northeast so I have some bearing on altitude. This red light seemed way lower than the jets that fly over to land at the small airport 8miles NE of my house. Since I spontaneously stopped to turn my head to look at the sky behind me, I almost feel as if I was psychic-ly compelled to.. I'm on crutches for a leg injury, when I'm walking I typically try to get to point a to b asap because they are uncomfortable. And if I would have looked a second too early or a second too late I would have missed it if it was indeed some natural meteorological event like ball lightning or perhaps a meteor.. To the best of my knowledge, I've ruled out meteor because it seemed so low in the sky and it's trajectory wasn't a strait streak across the sky.. All the shooting stars I've seen are very high up in the atmosphere and not red like a siren. I! don't know much about ball lightning, but I'm assuming all li! ghtning would appear, I don't know, white or blue... Not red. Also, there was no noise. So I'm left thinking I saw something phenomenal, not quite sure what to make of it. I just find it strange as a skeptic following the UFO story recently, in depth, that I would have a personal sighting days before the DNI report to Congress. And at the time, after the observation, I just turned back around, hopped in my truck, and went on my way like nothing totally bizarre just happened--I was totally calm and reacted nonchalant. I find it strange I wasn't more excited, or went to tell my mother inside, or got my phone out to record in case it reappeared, or went in my back yard to try and get another look (my backyard doesn't have trees so views of the sky are wide in that direction). It's quite extraordinary all things considered and it's almost like I was in a trance. Maybe it was disbelief I don't know. But, now I think about it very often. Two weeks went by before telling anyone. Now, I've! told family and friends and decided to report after watching Mick West interview Alex Dietrich about the Nimitz encounter. She made a point to report sightings if you have one. Anyway, I'm much more open minded to a more exotic explanation of recent news. That's all. Oh and by the way I'd swear on the bible and take a lie detector test, no problem. I don't know what I saw but I sure saw something weird and it fits with the light ufo sightings and videos others have documented, so.. There seems to be a pattern. I'm just curious if anyone else in my area saw it that early evening I live in a very heavily populated suburb. Lastly, this may be totally unimportant, but I have an old flat screen TV in my kitchen that has been turning on by itself multiple (1-3)times a day for the past few months. Anyway, that's it. Thank you.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
