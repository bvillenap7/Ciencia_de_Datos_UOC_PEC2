Bright Moving STAR in Sky;2009-07-03 00:00:00;all day - still going on;Bright Moving STAR in Sky I live in Katy, TX and this morning before work around 6:00am, I was on my patio smoking a cigarette and noticed a bright star that I never remember seeing before. I stared at it for not even a minute before I realized it was moving very gently to the left then to the right. I was still waking up at the time so I didn't really think anything of it. Now I'm currently on my patio at 11:53PM and that exact same star I saw this morning is further to the right and moving exactly how it was moving this morning. I dragged my boyfriend out here a minute ago to check it out and he see's it moving too! It's moving very slowly in a ping pong fashion, if that makes any sense, but looks like its staying in place if you just glance at it. Is anyone else noticing this too? We both got chills when we both saw it move!    UPDATE: It is now 2:22AM and I've been watching this star for the past hour. It is still there and bobbing up in down.

looked like a satellite with two lights spead apart to be a large object.;2011-01-03 18:30:00;00:30;looked like a satellite with two lights spead apart to be a large object. It was around 6:30 pm on January 2 2011 when I was outside grilling.  I called my wife outside to see Jupiter in the night sky.  Which was bright and by it's self overhead facing south west. Until, just north of Jupiter, we saw what appeared to be a plane tracking north from the south.  It was moving around the same speed as the I.S.S. the last time I had seen it, when the space shuttle was 10 seconds behind about to dock.  It appeared as two lights side by side, one light on the east and one on west side. No blinking lights, and no red or green.  Just like watching satellites, it appeared in the sky and moved at one speed in one direction.  Until it got little north of us overhead and disappeared. I know what planes in the night sky look like and I've seen many of satellites.  What ever we saw that night had to have been two objects flying together or one massive object.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
V-shaped light in sky;2012-06-01 20:30:00;10+ minutes;V-shaped light in sky I took photos of a V shaped &quotfireball&quot thing in the Western  part of the sky yesterday. I thought it was Venus till I saw that it  was shaped like a V. I have several pics of it. I didn't take any  video because it was so small it would have just looked like a dot. the object was not moving very fast.  It was red/orange. Looked like it was on fire. It might not have been moving at all,  but locked in orbit because it seemed to move with the rotation of  the sky. It was in the sky for at least 10min. The pictures I took  have all the exact times on them. After I took the photos I got out  my telescope which is a Celestron Powerseeker 114 EQ D=114mm  F1=900mm F/8 Model#21045  	I witnessed the object at about 8:30pm cst in the west about  20-30 degrees above the horizon. No apparent movement. Seemed to be  locked in geo stationary orbit. I will link my pictures and a video  I did asking for anyone with info about what it is to contact me.

Daylight sighting of multi-colored object and bright lights in triangular pattern.;2012-11-18 09:56:00;1.5 minutes;Daylight sighting of multi-colored object and bright lights in triangular pattern I was in the driveway of my son's home in Katy TX, finishing a phone call with one of my customers.  The home faces almost due north.  Weather unusually cool and dry for the Houston area, very little wind, no clouds. I noticed what at first I thoght was a bunch of balloons floating toward me.  Movement was from approximately N/NE. I could see several colors: blue/green, yellow, reddish orange, all on the upper side of the object. As it got closer overhead I realized that the object was much larger than I originally thought because a twin engine airplane flew at considerable distance below it (flying east to west).  No airports are nearby that I know of. When it reached around 13:30 elevation above me, three very bright lights in a perfect triangle appeared on the bottom.  I then began to doubt that it was a bunch of balloons.  For the lights to to be reflections, the surfaces would have to have been mirror-polished. I had a good digital camera in my car parked across the street (unfortunately the macro lens was installed at the time). I walked to the car because the object was moving slowly I wasn't in a big hurry. As I got close to the car, I looked up and saw that the object was making a sharp turn to the N/NW and moving very rapidly.  The bright lights below were still visible. I grabbed the camera as quickly as I could, but the object was already almost out of sight and disappearing above the rooftops of 2-story homes across the street.  I snapped 4 photos, but I can't see anything in them.  The focus was on manual, we had been taking photos of the grandkids.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
A line of white lights descending slowly over Houston Texas  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 05:00:00;Minutes;A line of white lights descending slowly over Houston Texas As I walked my dog this morning I saw a line of white lights over the houston sky going west when the line started to descend. The descent was slow and disappeared in the tree line. It appeared to me to be a line of individual lights maybe 25. Please let me know what this could be.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
