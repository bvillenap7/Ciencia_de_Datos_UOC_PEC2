They were really upset and shaken. They never mentioned the word ufo or space ship.The girls swore to me they did not make this up, and I made them draw a picture of what they saw. It was oval with red flashing lights in the middle.They then threw away the picture saying they hope to never see this sighting again. My daughter refused to sleep in her bed that night.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
High flying curving white orb.;2010-09-11 18:30:00;15 minutes;High flying curving white orb. Looking out over my back yard to the east we noticed this curviture trail in the sky, it was an white orb pulling a 90 degree tuning north climbing exteremy high, abnormally fast.   Once it reached a point in the sky to the NW, it turned in another 90 degree angle back to the south.  We lost it in the clouds,  I have watched the sky's all my life I am 44 and I have no idea what that was... It was very high in the sky, higher then any airliners I have seen.  Pretty amazing to see!;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
Blue/Grey colored oval shape. The next day, fast moving pulsing object. Texas.;2013-10-06 19:45:00;2-3 minutes;Blue/ Grey colored oval shape. The next day, fast moving pulsing object. Texas I observed two different UFO’s on two consecutive days in Katy, Texas. The first was on Sunday, October 6, 2013, at 7:45 P.M. then again on Monday, October 07, 2013, in the same part of the sky.  The first one I saw was oval shaped and nearly blended in with the sky behind it.  The sky at that time was a deep blue color and not completely night.  The object that I observed was slightly lighter than the sky.  It was a blue, grayish color.  It did not have wings or lights of any kind. It moved from North to South.  The object caught my eye after I looked up at an airplane moving from East to West.  The object crossed paths with the airplane at least a football field below it.  The object I observed did not make any sound.  I could not hear the airplane either.  I lost sight of the oval shaped object as it flew further away. Monday, October 07, 2013 I observed a second UFO.  It was around the same time of day as the first sighting.  I had just stepped out to walk the dogs, when I looked in the same general direction as the previous object and saw a light flash on and then off.  It did not occur to me that it was a light in the sky flashing on and off until I saw it flash on and off again.  I thought it was a star at first because of the white color.  It sat in the sky right below a star for about 10 seconds.  Then the object moved from East to West at a fast pace.  It was faster than an airplane moves across the sky. It would slowly flash on and off as it moved.  It looked as if it were pulsing on and off slowly.  I lost sight of it as it flew further away. I didn’t see anything other than that. I guess it could have been a plane on both occasions, but it didn’t look like any aircraft I have seen in person or on TV. There was no sound and the second one was stationary in the sky for about 10 seconds.  I do believe there could be Aliens out there, and I know the Air Force has some pretty cool Top Secret stuff as well.  I just wish I could have flown myself up there and looked at whatever it was close up.  Both objects were the size of your thumbnail if you held it out towards the sky.  As far a size goes, I don’t know any other way to explain it other than the first object looked about the size of a pellet if you held it out to the sky with an extended hand.  The second object just looked like a light.  I could not see shape to it.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
Very shiny object in the sky.;2016-06-23 18:00:00;<1 minute;Very shiny object in the sky On June 23, 2016, I was driving home from work in Houston heading west toward Katy on I-10.  It was around 6:20pm, so the sun was still high in the sky.  It was sunny and partly cloudy.  A shiny object in the sky caught my eye.  I would say that it was like an oval-ish shape, I couldn't see any sharp edges but it was solid.  The reflection was bright and it made it hard to see the actual shape of the object was.  I did not see it appear, I just happened to notice it.  I was around I-10 and Dairy Ashford and it was on my right, north of I-10.  It was wasn't too high but it wasn't too low on the horizon to where the view of it could be obstructed by trees or anything.  I just stared at it.  There was some traffic so I wasn't driving too fast so I was able to see if it had a trajectory path but it did not move, it stayed at the same position.  I was trying to see if it was a plane, but the way that it shone, it could have not been because it wasn't small enough, the reflection was too bright and it would require a lot more surface area.  The shape of a small plane could of not have cast the amount to light or reflection that this object did and from that distance, it would of been too small anyway.  At first all I could notice was the bright reflective surface, but the more I looked, I could see that it was silver on the bottom part.  Again, it was hard to see the actual shape of the object, but it was solid. There is a small airport on Groschke Road that is between Barker Cypress and Hwy 6.  I occasionally see small planes take off so its not out of ordinary for me to see things in the sky,  I have even seen colorful hot air ballons come from south of I-10 in Katy,  I am not too sure where exactly they come from but it has been a while since I have seen those.  However, this object or I guess UFO was rather large but at the same time seemed far away.  If I would guess where the UFO was on top of, I would guess that it was between the Mason Rd to Fry Rd and Saums to Clay Rd area.  So as I am driving I pass under the Hwy 6 overpass and when I look at the same spot in the sky, it was gone.  I looked around to see if it moved lower or higher but it was nowhere.  The Hwy 6 overpass only obstructed my view for about 5 seconds.  The length of time that I saw this UFO was no more than 1 minute. When I first saw it I felt curious and I was thinking of all the possibilites of what this could of be! en. When I continued to see it, I felt kind of confused because I couldn't understand what the object was and when it disappeared quickly I was just shocked and I also felt upset at myself for not taking a picture of it. I am sure that it would of been visible. If somebody knows what this object was or if you saw it too, please leave a comment.  I have been trying to forget or to talk myself out of thinking that I saw a UFO.  I am not one of those kind of people that think that there are aliens out there or those that do a lot of research on conspiracy theories but I cannot explain what could that could have been but I KNOW what I saw. I can't talk myself out of this and forget it so I wanted to let others know. Sorry this is so long but I wanted to be highly descriptive!;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
