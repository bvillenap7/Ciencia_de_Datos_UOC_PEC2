Morning sighting of brightly lit disc which dematerialized;2019-12-11 07:32:00;10 SECONDS;Morning sighting of brightly lit disc which dematerialized We were heading north on 99/Grand Parkway in morning traffic, at a standstill. Observed a disc-type craft, emanating bright light, to the northeast, which did not appear to be moving in any particular direction, but hovering with very minimal movement. The object was near a very small cloud, almost in front of it. The light increased in intensity, and the object appeared to dematerialize in a matter of 1-2 seconds, as did the cloud. Very clear day, viewed by two people simultaneously.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
