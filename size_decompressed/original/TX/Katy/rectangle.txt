Red light hovering in sky then moved away at incredible speed.;2011-09-03 20:40:00;50 minutes;Red light hovering in sky then moved away at incredible speed. Large red light with white light next to it in sky south of I 10 in Katy.  Lights blinked for a short period of time but were mostly steady.  Looking through binoculars you could discern a rectangular shape of the two lights.  After a short time the lights merged into one large red light. Important part is that it hovered in the exact same position for the majority of the 50 minutes.  I would guess the altitude at 15,000 feet.   We live along a landing approach to Hobby Airport in Houston so we often see speed of planes on approach to Hobby.  When this object moved away, it moved at at least twice the speed of typical approaching airliners.   When it did speed away, the object erupted in a number of lights, all along one straight line. Also of interest is that soon thereafter we noticed an airplane that seemed to be leaving Hobby Airport to the east.  The lights were blinking at a regular interval and were red and blue and easily identified as an airplane.  So what we ! saw was not an airplane and hovered at an altitude not normally seen, I suspect, for helicopters.
