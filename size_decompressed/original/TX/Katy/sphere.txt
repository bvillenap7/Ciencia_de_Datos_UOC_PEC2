Circling my neighborhood in the wee hours, about 3:30 am, as I walked to the west on the other side of my sub-division, I looked to the NW where I had an unobstructed 120 degree view of the sky.   There I saw an orange ball about the size of number four shot held at arm's length motionless in a two o'clock po sition.  It remained at rest for five or so seconds.  It suddenly began to move to the south to a two o'clock position covering the 120 degrees of sky in 5 - 7 seconds.  During that time it made two opposite 45 degree abrupt turns before disappearing behind the houses to my southern view.  The whole incident lasted 15 seconds or so.  The color of the object was orange like the orange of the University of Texas and the color remained the same during the entire incident.  This occurred on a Saturday morning but I do not remember which Saturday in July it was.  It appeared to be several miles away and several thousand feet in altitude based on my experience viewing aircraft.  There was no sound associated with the sighting.

After coming up from a dive I saw a glowing green sphere floating in the air over my neighbor's house.  It appeared to be the size of a basketball.  It moved very slowly and descended behind the trees.  It made no noise at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763

The crafts had a central orange light with a brighter glow on the back.   30 minutes after the sighting I discovered that two of my other friends had seen the lights. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the time above, to reflect a sighting that occurred just after midnight, which appears to us to be what the witness implies in the report.

The;2020-09-08 19:30:00;20 minutes;Just before dusk on September 7th of 2020 something that looked like a large glowing ball or disk passed silently over our house.  The object which emitted no detectable sound was first spotted in the northeast moving towards the southwest.  In addition to the glowing center two other extremely bight and disorienting lights pulsed alternating left and right on the sides of the object.  The object was in view for approximately twenty minutes and seemed to move much slower than the sort air craft that are sometimes seen in the area.;29.7899585321099;-95.7942016513763
