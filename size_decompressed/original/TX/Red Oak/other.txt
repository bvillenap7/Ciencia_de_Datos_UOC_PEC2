An amber pulsating bell shaped object;2011-03-01 22:30:00;30 seconds;An amber pulsating bell shaped object It was early March 2011, and it was the last day of my sonâ€™s visit.  My son is a helicopter pilot in the military.  Around 10:30pm, I decided to go to bed, and said goodnight to my son who was still watching television.  I stood in front of my bedroom window gazing out as I always do before getting ready for bed. Coming from the southeast, I saw a commercial airline preparing to land at DFW International Airport, I live about 45 minutes to an hour from the airport, depending on traffic. Off to my right of the commercial airline, I saw an object I have never seen before in my life.  I ran into the family room where my son was and told him to come outside with me, and we walked outside.  I showed him where the commercial airline was, and then pointed to the object on my right. I asked him what is that, he said he did not know he has never seen anything like it.  It was somewhat shaped like a bell, and the whole thing was lit up with amber light, and pulsating.  It was not moving very fast. The only reason I saw it for about 30 seconds was because for some unknown reason I went back into the house, asking myself at the same time why I was going into the house instead of watching where it was going, but I could not stop myself, and I went straight to bed, and to sleep immediately. I do not know if my son followed me in or not.  I remember it as if it was yesterday, my son does not remember any of this happening.  He said I must have been dreaming it.  I know I was not dreaming it.  I saw it, he saw it, and I cannot explain why this happened.;32.5195;-96.8104999999998
