My husband asked if that was a star in the sky and I said no it is too bright to be a star.  The object wasn't moving so as we got closer to it, it started moving slightly toward our car. When it directly over our car we pulled over to get a better look.  The object just hovered mostly but as we looked at it longer it started to move away from under our car.  It was very quiet.  Never heard a noice from it.  We watched it fly away slowly and so we proceeded on our way.  As we were driving down FM1008 I noticed another one in the sky.  It could have possibly been the same one but I don't think so.  This is the second sighting I've had in this area in past 2 years.;30.0091;-94.8746000000001
