Shooting light.;2018-01-12 19:30:00;Seconds;Shooting light I saw a large white light.  For a moment I thought, shooting star, but quickly realized that there was no way.  First it was too large.  The large light was appeared to be about the size of an airplane high up.  Second the light was brilliant white, almost blue.  It was rather diamond shaped, with the light fading behind the back corner.  This ‘corner’ didn’t actually touch, but seemed to trail behind.  Inside these two trails was a small second light.  Easily 1/16 the size of the large light, maybe smaller.   As I drove North on Highway 321 from Dayton, I noticed this light shooting through the sky.  I saw it from the top of my windshield to maybe halfway down the windshields which point it vanished. I thought it had maybe gone behind a tree I couldn’t see in the dark.  But after driving further, there was no tree in the area.  The light moved fast.  When it went it did not fade or slowly disappear, it was just gone as if someone had turned off the switch.  I do not know ! what I saw.  But I know that I have never seen anything like it before.;30.0091;-94.8746000000001
Object appeared in Draco constellation as bright as star Arcturus then disappeared.;2019-04-27 00:24:00;2 seconds;Object appeared in Draco constellation as bright as star Arcturus then disappeared. At Approximately 12:24 AM 4/27/2019 in Dayton, Texas, I witnessed something while star gazing.  It was in the Northeastern sky in the Draco constellation. In my area the light pollution is around a 6 or 7 on the light pollution scale.  I had just backed away from my Celestron 20x80 sky master pro binoculars, when I saw what appeared to be a star grow as bright as the star Arcturus (the fourth-brightest in the night sky, and the brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere.) then fade back out.  I quickly jumped back to my binoculars to locate the object, but had no luck.  The experience happened for approximately 2 seconds.  At the time, the weather was perfect with no clouds in sight. There were no planes in the sky either at the time.  I proceeded to checked Calsky.com for possible satellites in the area of sky or for possible flare ups and everything came back clear.;30.0091;-94.8746000000001
