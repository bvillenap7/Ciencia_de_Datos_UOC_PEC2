This happened many years ago while fishing for catfish one night. I was accompanied by my step-son, who was 15 years old at the time. In the past, I have been able to spot satellites cross the sky. They are easy to spot during clear skies. Not sure if there was any moon light that night, but the skies were extremely clear, I do remember. As we do often while fishing and waiting for fish to strike, we try to spot these satellites moving across the sky at night. I spotted one in no time and motioned my son over to look at it...he was impressed at the speed. Usually, these objects are very small and look like light dots moving quite fast across from one side of the sky to as far as our eyes could see. This dot of light was moving consistently with what I have witness a few times before when spotting these satellites. As it moved across, my son and I were tracking it and pointing at it when all of the sudden it stopped and it took off faster than it was moving in the beginning.....90 degrees to our right. This object seemed to stop dead on and took off 90 degrees from the direction it was traveling and it disappeared. Needless to say, we were speechless. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Hovering and flashing object at a distance in the night sky;2004-03-30 23:00:00;ongoing;Hovering and flashing object at a distance in the night sky My husband and I live about 10 miles from Ft. Hood, Texas. We walked outside around 2300 and noticed a very bright, and unusual object in the western sky. After staring at it for a few minutes, we agreed we saw red and blue lights flashing along with the white light, but it did not appear to move. It seemed to fade and brighten, and appeared to be spinning in place. After watching a few other aircraft in the area, one of which kept changing direction, we were certain it was not an aircraft. After wacthing for about 10 minutes we went inside, waited another 10 minutes and went outside. It had moved lower in the sky, but in relation with the moon and stars. We again watched for a few minutes, with no noticable movement across the sky. It is still in the western sky, and still appears to be simply hovering and flashing red and blue lights.;31.0261433908047;-97.6137537356317
Very odd blue light in the sky caught my eye.;2012-11-30 23:45:00;10 minutes;Very odd blue light in the sky caught my eye. I had stepped outside tonight to smoke a cigarette because I don't smoke inside my house. As always I looked up at the sky to look at the star(I looked north, I google map myself to be sure which direction I was looking)  I seen a bright blue light in the sky I t was very odd and caught my eye immediately. At first I thought it was a helicopter. This is very common because I live close to a army base. As I continued to watch this blue light it did very odd things. First this blue light moved up into the sky then took a shape turn to the right very slowly, then it started to come back down to were I couldn't see it because the house in front of me blocked my view.  This light reappeared as it moved back in to my view.  Then the weirdest thing happened, the blue light begun to fade and disappear, shortly it reappeared but it was not blue anymore it was shinning red.   It then hovered for a few minutes and did this sequence again, the red faded tell I couldn't see it! and reappeared blue.  This was very odd so I ran inside to get my camera phone so I could film this.  Getting my camera phone was my biggest mistake it didn't take me but 30 seconds to get phone and run back outside and it gone.  I wish I could of got this on film and hope I was not the only one that saw this tonight.;31.0261433908047;-97.6137537356317
