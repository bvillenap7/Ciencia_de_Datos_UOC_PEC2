UFO IN COLORADO CITY TX- GLOWING METALLIC OBJECT THAT MOVED VERY FAST;2006-04-01 18:00:00;5 minutes;UFO IN COLORADO CITY TX- GLOWING METALLIC OBJECT THAT MOVED VERY FAST I WAS INCARCERATED IN THE DICK WARE UNIT IN COLORADO CITY TX PRISON. I HAD BEEN THERE FOR ABOUT ONE YEAR AND A FEW MONTHS BUT AM FROM EL PASO TX. WELL I WOULD ALWAYS GO OUTSIDE TO EXERCISE AT ABOUT 6 TO 7 PM, BUT ON THIS DAY I WAST TO TIRED SO I SAT ON A LAID DOWN ON A BENCH JUST LOOKING UP AT THE STARS. THEN SOMETHING TO MY RIGHT THAT LOOKED LIKE A STAR CAUGHT MY ATTENTION BECAUSE IT WAS BLINKING MORE THAN A NORMAL.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A STAR SO A JUST STARED AT IT,THEN IN A SECOND IT WENT FROM THE SIZE OF A STAR TO ALMOST THE SIZE OF THE MOON. AT FIRST I WAS JUST SHOCKED, THEN I STARTED TAPPING THE GUY NEXT MO ME,  NOT TAKING MY EYES OFF THE OBJECT.  THEN JUST AS FAST IT TURNED BACK TO THE SIZE OF A STAR, THE GUY NEXT TO ME ASKED IF IT WAS A STAR BECAUSE HE TURNED WHEN IT HAD GOTTEN SMALLER AGAIN, BUT THEN WHEN I WAS GOING TO TELL HIM HOW IT HAD CHANGED SIZE,AS WE WHERE BOTH LOOKING AT IT, IT JUST TOOK OFF VERY FAST LEAVING A STREAK OF LIGHT. ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER ANOTHER GUY SAW THE SAME THING NOBODY BELIEVED HIM LIKE NOBODY BELIEVED ME, UNTIL THE GUY THAT WAS NEXT TO ME THAT NIGHT HEARD HIM TALKING ABOUT IT.  WE GOT TOGETHER AND TURNS OUT THAT WE BOTH SAW EXACTLY THE SAME THING. AND THERE WAS NO SOUND AT ALL;32.4016;-100.8625
