Red and green glow to lights on  triangle crafts and GIANT falling star w/ green tracer  then broke into 3 parts.;2011-07-30 23:00:00;4 hours;Red and green glow to lights on  triangle crafts and GIANT falling star w/ green tracer  then broke into 3 parts and many falling stars We saw lights in the night sky thought to be stars, but not. These lights looking like stars other than their red and green changing glow. They where in a triangle pattern, with a star/light at each point, and moved swaying side to side and also up and down as if it was a bobber in the ocean or a top trying to maintain balance. We saw three different crafts, but one that stayed over the same area over a 4 hour period of time. Not moving with the other stars as the Earth turned over the 4 hour time. Then around 1:45am to 2:00am on July 31, 2011 we saw a GIANT 'falling star' that had a green tracing glow, this 'falling star' then broke or exploded into 3 easily seen pieces that had an orange  glow. This night from about 23:00 on July 30, 2011 to 3:00am on July 31,2011 we also saw at least twenty to thirty 'falling stars', most looked as if they where projected from the crafts. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of twinkling star, together with meteors??  PD));30.0151;-97.1498000000001
