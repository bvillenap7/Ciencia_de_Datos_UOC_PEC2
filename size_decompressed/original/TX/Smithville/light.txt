3 lights high in the sky.;2008-08-17 22:45:00;1 minute or more;3 lights high in the sky. I was stargazing one night when I noticed 3 objects very high in the night sky that looked like 3 satellites, but they were tracking in the same direction!  They seemed to be flying in a triangle formation, and did not appear to be a single ship.  The 3 points of light were moving from right to left across the sky at satellite speed, then they slowed and together turned upwards from my vantage point.I watched them until they were too dim to see.  The event lasted about a minute or more. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to be quite sober-minded and sincere about the several sightings she though she had had, during her lifetime.  This is one of seven reports she submitted.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));30.0151;-97.1498000000001
