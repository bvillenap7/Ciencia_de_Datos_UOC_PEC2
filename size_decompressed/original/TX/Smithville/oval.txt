Fast walker object blinks in and out over Texas;2006-04-02 20:58:00;seconds;Fast walker object blinks in and out over Texas I was sitting outside this evening when I suddenly watched I hoped was a meteorite streaking from the east to the west to my due south .... when I realized there was no vaper trail as it whizzed in and out of the broken clouds. It had a distinct tractory or path that isn't seen with any ball lightning phenomenon. I saw it blink in and out of sight three times before it zoomed out of sight. No sound was observed.;30.0151;-97.1498000000001
