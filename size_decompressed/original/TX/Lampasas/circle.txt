Several orange lights on UFO seen twice.;2014-05-15 21:45:00;15 minutes;Several orange lights on UFO seen twice Me and my family members were driving north on 281 through Lampasas and we were looking to the west and saw what looked like an orange shooting star just burning out.   They told me it was probably just a plane and then about 15 minutes later there were several lights that lit up and were spinning in a counter clockwise direction.  I could clearly see that there were bright individual orange lights on the UFO.   After about 10 minutes of driving we just laughed about it and forgot.   The lights then came on again in front if us to the east of 281 and I glanced over to the west and there were two flying objects flying at high speeds towards the UFO.   1 minute later the two flying objects disappeared and the orange lights came on again and repeatedly came on and went off for about 2 minutes.  Haven't seen it since. Tried to video but it was too dark ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));31.0687;-98.1768
