Orbs that change colors, hide among the constellations and wave back at us!;2014-02-08 01:00:00;1 hour;Orbs that change colors, hide among the constellations and wave back at us! The spheres are bright.  They have red, white, blue,and green lights that pulsate and swirl around the sphere itself.  Some nights they are very large, therefore appearing close to Earth.  At times they appear to turn to and fro.  There are many of them in our sky and some appear to form a large circle with much space between them like a dot to dot color book. Others are in triangles or hide inside of constellations. This will sound silly to most, however, try waving wildly at one of them (as if they are your friend and you're very happy to see them) and see what you get in return.  I've asked several people including one person on the phone who did so as I waited for them.  The results will shock or intrigue you perhaps both.  The result will be that they flash faster and brighter as if to answer you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
