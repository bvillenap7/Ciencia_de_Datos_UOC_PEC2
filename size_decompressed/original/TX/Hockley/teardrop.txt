Very bright Teardrop shape plunging vertically to the west;2011-06-18 22:45:00;5 seconds;Very bright Teardrop shape plunging vertically to the west While standing outside in my driveway chatting with a friend around 10:45 PM, I saw a spectacular TEARDROP shaped object traveling vertically from high to low.  The object was blue/white in the largest main center portion with thin concentric outer layers of darker blue and green on the outer most layer.   There was no discernable sound (but the wind direction would have carried any sound away to the north).   I was standing looking directly to the west and my friend was looking to the east.  I was telling him about my last two UFO sightings and how I hadnâ€™t had a good meteor sighting in a good while. It was a few seconds after I said that.   I turned to face the west and moving very rapidly I saw the TEARDROP shape moving straight down between two tall pine trees, disappearing behind some oaks in the distance.   This object just appeared out of nowhere as I looked at the sky to the west through some tall pines.  It traveled in a perfect vertical line with no smoke trai! l behind it.  It did appear to have a very thin dark streak or attachment to the pointed end (about as long as the object itself) which was facing skyward.  It was very defined and not diminishing in size or brightness as it moved downward.  It was VERY bright. If it was a meteor, it was unlike anything I have ever seen.  The perfect TEARDROP shape was really unusually symmetrical and solid looking.  and did not appear to be burning up in the atmosphere.   There were no other aircraft in the vicinity and the moon was still very low to the east and not yet visible above the forest in that direction, so the sky was still fairly dark to the west.   I suspect it must have been at a great distance.  If it did impact the earth, no sound was heard in my direction. Keep looking up and keep reporting!;30.0727;-95.8087999999999
