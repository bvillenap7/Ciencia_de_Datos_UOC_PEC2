Walked out that morning to get my paper about 4:50am..it was dark, cool, clear no moon and no clouds stars were beautiful.  As I,walked down my driveway picked up my paper turned to face my house which would be west. I saw what at first looked like a flock of geese V shape, leading edge. Then I, noticed that the background stars were blocked out.. as it got closer I, could really see how huge it was. It was boomerang shaped, black no noise I could not believe how low it was maybe 300ft. From center of chevron to wings was 400ft, as it was over head I, could see the leading edge to back of chevron was 50 to 60ft the street lights reflected off the underside no detail.  I,continued to watch it head East until I, lost sight of it...funny thing sunrise was only 20 minutes away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
