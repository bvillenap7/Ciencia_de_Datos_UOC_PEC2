The object was fixated 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon, at approximately 5 miles away from our vantage point and remained stationary.   The object appeared to be a star at first glance but quickly began to pulsate and emit bright contrasting colors of blue, red, purples, and oranges.   This object was not an airplane as it did not deviate from its position.   After observing the object in the stated times it suddenly ceased to exist, we did not see it fly off just simply vanish.;29.9709000000002;-93.9973000000005
