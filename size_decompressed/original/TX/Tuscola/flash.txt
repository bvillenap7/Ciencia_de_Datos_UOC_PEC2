Strobing Light ..;2005-06-18 22:00:00;15 minutes;Strobing Light .. Went out on my back porch at around 10:00pm when I looked straight out from where I was when I saw this strobing light, now theres no towers in the area or city lights we live in a small rural town and its very dark here at night after watching it remain in the same spot for about 2 minutes I called my father out to look at it ..it still remained in the spot spot about 2-3 minutes after I called him out then I had my mother come out and look at it too, we sat out there for about 15 minutes till it started to fade away ..didnt travel away just kind of faded out ..it was a crystal clear night ..nothing but stars in the sky but this object wasn't exactly high up in the sky it was kind of over the horizon and the strobing was quite bright ..it definately wasnt sirius or venus it was way to low to be either of those ..let me add that the object was already there when I went out onto my back porch. I think thats about all ..if I left anything out will be sure to write back and add it ..;32.2355;-99.8227
