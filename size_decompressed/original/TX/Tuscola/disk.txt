Object there, then gone ..;2005-06-03 00:55:00;Few Seconds;Object there, then gone .. First I just want to say I dont know how other people feel when they think they've seen a UFO but im kind of in awe ..I cant stop thinking about it and this just happened a few minutes ago.  Went out on my front porch to smoke, when I look up over the houses across the street and not to far off in the background was this craft, that had what appeared to be windows on the side square in shape and very noticable in the night sky, I thought maybe a plane, but in the big sky we have here  within' the time I tilted my head down to light my cigarette <which took maybe 2 seconds> and I looked back up and it was gone, theres nothing there to hide or obscure it view from me ..theres nothing but sky here .. I walked down to end of my block which isnt far maybe 30 ft since we live on the corner house and theres a field down there im guessing its a wheat field but im not sure ..then this white ball shot over the field at an amazing speed and that was it ..but I know what I saw and I know a plane cannot vanish in the sky we have here especially within' a few second time frame ....it was crystal clear out many many stars were out ...I could draw a diagram but im not to fond of computers ..but I did draw one on paper here ..;32.2355;-99.8227
