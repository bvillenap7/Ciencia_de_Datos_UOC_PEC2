I was traveling home from work alone... I work the night shift... I randomly looked up in the sky and suddenly saw a huge fireball looking teardrop shape flying across the sky in a downward direction... It was like blue-yellow with some sort of smoke or something behind it... There was no sound what so ever that I could hear... I rolled down my window and nothing! I immediately thought of maybe a falling star... But ofcourse the sun was rising and there were no other stars out... I don't know what to make of it.
