an octangular object was flying above highway 59.;2011-01-07 20:30:00;2.5 min;an octangular object was flying above highway 59. I was driving south on Hwy 59 when my son told me there was something in the sky. I first thought it was the moon.  But i then looked closer and i thought to myself the moon doesn't have an octangular bottom.  The moon was on the opposite side of the object my son and i were looking at. The octangular shape had a really bright white bottom light.  The object then was moving slowly then quicly changed directions. Then dissapeared.
