Seven orange lights moving slowly at low altitude beside highway.;2016-01-23 20:15:00;5-8 minutes;Seven orange lights moving slowly at low altitude beside highway. Suspected UFO sighting  Sat Jan 23, 2016  8:15PM  Driving down FM2109 outside Huntington TX, coming home from moon viewing with friends and telescopes.  Mostly clear, a few light clouds, full moon or near full. At first, I saw 4 orange lights above the road to my left, pulled over to get a look and some pictures at the first available driveway.  Once stopped I could see there were 6 orange lights, moving slowly at low altitude, probably no more than 2000 feet.  The 3 in front were in a triangle formation, the 3 following in a semi straight line. I tried to get a couple of pictures, due to the lens I was using (135mm)  I was only able to get one at a time rather than the whole group.  After trying to get pictures of one in the rear, I saw that two in front were gone, and a seventh had appeared bringing up the rear. The one in the lead started to slowly climb to a higher altitude, getting dimmer, until it finally went out of sight.  The others all did the same, until all 7 were gone. Orange lights is all I could see, no details of any definite craft, no flying craft I know of made on this planet has lights that color.   Also, totally silent, no noise I could hear at all.  A couple of cars passed by as I stood and watched, none stopped.  Between cars I could hear quite well, if they had made any noise at all I would have been able to easily hear it.  A helicopter at that altitude, for example, would have been loud. These were just lights, of a very unusual color, moving slowly at low altitude, with no noise at all. I could not determine any definite shape, so I cannot say if they were round, oblong, or whatever.;31.2818;-94.5592
