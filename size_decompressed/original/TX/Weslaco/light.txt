PD));2009-02-05 21:00:00;40 MIN;My friend was driving west on expressway 83 while talking on cell phone with me.  She noticed a huge bright light in the sky towrds Mcallen Texas to the west. She told me to go outside to see it.  I was in Weslaco, Texas about 7 miles away. I noticed it and took out my binoculars to observe it.  I saw  a bright white light with small red dot in the middle. Light was stationary for about 15-20 minutes. I called my mom who lives five miles away to the west. She also saw the same thing.  My son also saw it earlier about 10 minutes before I did.  My friend called me later and told me she observed the light from her home with binoculars very clearly. She said she saw a bright light with yellowish lights in the middle and some kind of mist/smoke coming out from it. I must say the light was about 15-=20 miles away from us.  After observing it for 15-20 minutes,the light slowly moved towards the west.  I lost sight of it due to trees etc.  I have never seen anthing like it before. Not even the others who saw it.  I wonder if anybody else saw this light.  I called our local tv station and they said nobody had reported anything.  A plane ? monrning star ? I don't know. Anyone out there saw this light ?

Silently we sat frozen murmering as my friend slowly reached for his phone to record it elevated slowly showing just a slight bit of its thin sharp although disk like shape some what sharp on the back like what bat man would drive shiny almost camouflaged as we began to record the ball of light shook as if it gained awareness of us.  It levetated silently about 20 more feet after it being only 20 feet in the air then shot straight up and across the night sky in two bursts leaving a small blue tail .  When it stopped again it zig zagged slightly a purple beam sort of smokey looking appeared and disappeared taking th! e craft with it im deeplt concerned for my fellow people;26.1621653298839;-97.994697542044
