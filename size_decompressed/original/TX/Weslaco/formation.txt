06/15/1973+/- lubbock lights formation, Weslaco Texas, 10 +/- seconds, white light;1973-06-15 23:00:00;10 seconds;06/15/1973+/- lubbock lights formation, Weslaco Texas, 10 +/- seconds, white light At or around 1973 and around 23:00hrs, I remember being woken up by a neighbors car that seemed not to have mufflers, or a large hole in the exhaust system.  My father had this central fan that sucked air from the outside in and I remenber the window was open and cool night air coming in and it was plesant so it had te be late winter to early fall  or in between being in Weslaco Texas(Tip of Texas).  I remember looking out towards the open field and there was a lone tree directly in the middle of this 4 to 5 acre field with the cemetary across on the other side.  I must of been about 9 to 13 years old. I remember looking up at the sky as I pressed my face up against the screen window. and I saw what look like the Lubbock lights, the old thing is that I remember the V shape with lights in a single formation of 2 rows with single lights making the V formation.  It did not make a single sound. I was amazed and just remember it here and there. My kid is in college and brought it up, and that is how I came to this web sight.   I also remember the lights being sort of white to off white. It was not going slow of fast, so I don't recall a speed, but it was easy to follow till it was out of my sight.  It just went in a straight line from north to south. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));26.1621653298839;-97.994697542044
