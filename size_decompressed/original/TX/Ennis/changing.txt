Burnt orange craft sitting in the sky;2012-08-26 01:44:00;01:44-01:48;Burnt orange craft sitting in the sky I was standing outside and saw a huge strange object sitting in the sky.  It was a burnt orange color. The left side was more of a straight edge while towards the right was slimmer.  It sat there, very unnatural for about 1 minute.  As I ran inside to get someone who was sleeping and came out (about 1 minute had passed), it was fading south east into the distance.  In almost the same second, about an inch under (from my point of view, probably tons of miles in reality) a tiny light appeared and quickly became larger, and larger.  Again, it was a burnt orange color but was a completely different shape. I am not sure if it was the same object.  It was growing very quickly.  I would describe it like the shape of a bowl (eye level with one).  It was the size of a large moon at close range. It slowly within about 30 seconds lowered behind the trees out of sight. But extremely slow. I am 100% postive, as the other witness, it was nothing natural or anything that can be explained.  If it was I would not have found this website and told this story!;32.3322735849057;-96.6208679245284
