Extemely fast large oval transparent object.;2001-07-30 21:40:00;10 seconds;Extemely fast large oval transparent object. My friends and wife were out in our back yard watching the ISS go over I was looking in the southwestern sky when it came in to view we watched it for about 1 minute when a oval shaped object about the size of a half a football field came in to view, it was transparent but you could make out its outline clearly. The thing was silent moving south to north northwest  at an extremely high rate of speed, it covered the entire sky from horizon to horizon in 10 seconds. I am wanting to know if their have been any other sightings? I would also like to know if maybe it was some kind of anomally because it appeared to possibly be a reflection of the moon like maybe on the upper atmosphere!!!!!!!!! Please reply!!! Thank You.;32.3221;-102.5394
