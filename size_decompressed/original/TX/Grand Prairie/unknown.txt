UFO cloud/Hollowgram seen over Dallas Texas in the 1980's;1983-07-15 18:00:00;6 Minutes;UFO cloud/Hollowgram seen over Dallas Texas in the 1980's It was around the middle of summer in the early 1980's.  I don't know the exact date because I was only around 12 years old at the time.  I was in the family room watching TV with a few other family members which included my father. My older brother was out in front of the house trying to make time with his girlfriend. He saw something in the sky and came running into the house to tell my father to come have a look. Being a big fan of Star Wars and Close encounters at that time I wasn't going to miss a chance to see something that maybe out of this world. We grew up down the street from a Dallas navel base. To this day my brother clams that it was directly over the base. I remember it being directly over the house. What we saw was not a disk or craft of any kind. It wasn't scary to me at the time but has become so, as I have still to this day never even heard of anything like this being viewed by any other UFO observer. It was a cloud that had the center of it's mass erased. In the center was a series of neon blue lines that changed every 5 seconds or so. First look it was parallel blue lines. Then the lines would change direction. Reverb and change into something like dots. Then wavy lines and continued to do this kind of thing for about 5 to 6 minutes. It looked like a TV that was having trouble getting a signal. As if this cloud was one big hallow gram that was having trouble getting the center portion to work.  By this time a crowd of about 10 people where standing in the front yard looking up at this thing. At first I thought it was a blimp. I know that blimps have display screens but at the time couldn't do this kind of thing. I stayed in the front yard looking up for the next 2 1/2 hours thinking I'd see a blimp exit the clouds. Nothing! No noise, No craft, No blimp! I lived with my parents in the house from 1971 to 1993. I've never seen a blimp that large Nor have I seen one in the area because of the naval base being so close (4 Miles). I've been pouring over the UFO web sites to ! try and see if anyone has heard of or seen anything like what I've described. I've had no luck at all. I do have witnesses of the event. This includes 2 of my brothers, A sister and my father.I'm 37 now and It would be great to talk to others that may have seen something like this. Was it a signal from something related to the naval base? This is something both my father and older brother offered as a possible explanation.

Two objects seen in the night sky above Dallas on each side of a three star configuration.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars??  PD));2004-11-05 22:25:00;1 hour;Two objects seen in the night sky above Dallas on each side of a three star configuration with pulsating lights. I let our dog out around 10:25 last night and thought I would look around in the sky as the night was crystal clear and the stars were bright.  Grand Prairie is a suburb of Dallas.  There are always planes flying around and I enjoy watching their lights at night.  This night was different than any other I had evr witneesed.  I looked toward the east-northeast over Dallas and saw a star configuration of three stars perfect aligned, one above the other.  I noticed on either side of the middle star and equidistant on each side of that star, two objects which I could not discern as they were so far up.  The objects appeared to pulsate with a red,blue,and white or silver lights which were lined up vertically and in that order.  I thought it was odd that they did not move as planes do as I see so many from my neighborhood.  As I stood and watched these objects, I noticed they started moving in what appeared to be a lateral fashion in quick motions.  They moved in step with one another.  After watching these lights for several minutes, I went a got my wife, my 14 year old son, and my cousin who was visiting us to come see if they could tell me what they saw.  They were all astounded by these lights as well.  They witnessed what I did.  No one had any explanation.  The three stars aligned vertically were probably part of a constellation but none of us had ever seen pulsating or alternating lights in a constellation before.  That what led us to belive that we were witnessing something unusual.  At least to us it was.  The objects appeared much larger than the vertical stars.  It was just impossible to tell how far up in the sky they were.  I hope I have described this to some degree of specificity.  Never in my life have I seen such so this is my attempt at a description of unknown objects. We watched them for approximately an hour and then went back in the house.  I tried taking a digital photograph of them but the pictures did not come out as the objects were too far away. ((NUFORC Note:  Based on the description, we suspect that celestial bodies would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the objects were, in fact, genuine UFO's.  However, that is just a guess on our part.  PD));32.7067852122988;-97.0112583455335
