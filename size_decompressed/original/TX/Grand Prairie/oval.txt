Ufo sighting Grand Prairie, Tx. 10:30pm 9/21/13;2013-09-21 22:30:00;1-2 minutes;Ufo sighting Grand Prairie, Tx. 10:30pm 9/21/13 At about 10:30 this evening I saw somewhere in the range of 7 or 8 dull orange lights flying slowly in a broken formation.  At first they were distinct oval shapes then diminished down to what looked like car headlights in the distance however, they were in the sky.  I know aircraft.  These were not afterburners, flares or swamp gas.  I got them on video but it is about the quality you would expect, no good.  A couple of flickers, thats it.  They cruised at about the speed of a group of slow flying helicopters but there was no noise.  They flew along for about a minute then began to dissappear one by one.  That was the last I saw of them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));32.7067852122988;-97.0112583455335
