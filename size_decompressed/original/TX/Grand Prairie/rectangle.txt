black box high in the NE sky 11:50 DFW area;2008-01-13 11:50:00;30 seconds to one mintue;black box high in the NE sky 11:50 DFW area I did not know what to think of it at the time but after reading the reports from Stephenville TX I felt compelled to write. I have been in the aircraft business for over 25 years, first in the Marine Corps then in the civil world. I am a pilot and I have been around all kinds of aircraft and helicopters. I live just south of a major airport ( DFW ) and I know what modern aircraft look like and I know all the flight patterns for the approach for DFW and the smaller airports in the area.  Sunday aprox 11:50 am My daughter 15, her friend 15 and myself where driving North bound on Robinson rd ( cross street polo dr ) when I noticed something that looked like a big black box high in the sky, aprox N>E>  over Dallas. This object was really high in the sky, above the approach that airliners take to DFW or Love field. At first I thought it must be the blimp ready for the Dallas game that day. Upon further inspection while we sat at a red light in my truck it defiantly was a big Black Box shaped thing? I couldnâ€™t make out much detail but it seemed to have what I would call notches like a cube on it. At this time the light turned green and we drove due north, at this time my daughter saw a jetliner on approach to DFW and it was way below the alt of this thing. When we stopped again at the intersection of Robison rd and Westchester it was still there and the plane had traveled quite away and was disappearing from sight. AS we sat at the red light watching this thing it just disappeared?;32.7067852122988;-97.0112583455335
