Bright green light briefly lights sky, no sound;2003-08-10 23:30:00;3 seconds;Bright green light briefly lights sky, no sound I had been told about this phenomenon before by a friend but blew it off as a hoax by him on me. A week later, another friend of mine admitted to seeing the same thing, which got me interested. last night thought, I wittnessed it as well, needless to say I belive them now! Although my account wasn't as vivid as what they had relayed to me, it was just as beliveable. I was driving just off of highway 360 with a friend, windows down and the targa-roof off. We were doing maybe 45mph heading south-west when to the direct-south we saw an extrodinary green light on the horizon. It had to have been several miles out, but the glow lit up the sky above us like a pale day light. It seemed to pulse once, and then slightly less again to the west of the first. It was a quite night and we heard no boom or crack as if it was some sort of explosion. We spent the next hour driving south on 360 and around the mansfield/cedar hill area looking for the cause. None found, and no good excuse either. Theres a power plant out that way, but its natural gas, and it stood peacefully with all of its yellow lights on. This ones unexplained for now, and all four of us have seen it at one time or another.;32.7067852122988;-97.0112583455335
