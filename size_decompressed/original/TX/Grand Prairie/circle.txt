It wasn’t something from this planet and somebody or something was in control of it. It was like it came out of now where, but I wasn’t afraid and I don’t know why I wasn’t afraid I just wasn’t.  The light was very calming not blinding at all When it got close to me before hitting the ground it veered up what seem like just above the trees and I watched it as it disappeared into the distance.  It was never close enough to hit the ground but it was what  seemed to me clearly just above the tree in my front yard and went straight above the houses in where the my street turns and disappeared into the distance This thing was like someone was guiding it… there was no heat or anything coming from it and the light was not blinding and I do feel it was close enough to me for me to have felt some type of heat but here was none , nothing just light and speed.;32.7067852122988;-97.0112583455335
