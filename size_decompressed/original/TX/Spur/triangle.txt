I walked out into my front yard at 8:30 p.m. on February 23, 1999. I looked up and saw what appeared to be a triangular shaped object. It obscured the stars above my house. I went back inside to get my wife. We went to the front porch to see if we could see it. The object was going east to west. As it got about three to five miles from the house, there seemed to be something following it to the right of the object.I thought it might possibly be an aircraft following it. There was no sound whatsoever except the traffic on the highway. We watched this object for about 20 to 25 minutes. I called My dad to see if he could see anything from his house. He lives 70 miles from us. He did not see the object. The next day, the news media called the object an airplane. The object was too big and too quite to be any aircraft. I was 48 years old when I saw this oblect. I have had a steady job for 25 years.;33.4832;-100.8629
