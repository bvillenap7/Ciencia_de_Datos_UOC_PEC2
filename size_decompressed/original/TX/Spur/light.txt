Bright ball of light seen in evening sky in West Texas.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus sighting?  PD));2007-05-27 20:15:00;45+ min;Bright ball of light seen in evening sky in West Texas My wife and I left her parentâ€™s home in the North Western portion of Kent county (Spur in Dickens county is the closest town to the family ranch). We were traveling North on FM 1081 and noticed a bright object in the North West portion of the sky (which seemed north of Lubbock). We then turned the vehicle West on FM 261 and proceeded West bound until we reached FM 651 to go home to Crosbyton (located in Crosby county). The object appeared to be stationary and did not change in intensity or color. We witnessed the object  become obscured by clouds and clouds pass behind it within our time of travel. When we returned home the object was still visible and we were able to determine that it was North-North West of the city of Lubbock. The weather condition was stormy to the south of Kent, Dickens, and Crosby counties. We concluded that this object might have been a weather balloon reflecting light from the setting sun.
