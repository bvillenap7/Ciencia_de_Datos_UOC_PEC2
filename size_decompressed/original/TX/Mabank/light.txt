Large, bright ultra white light traveling across the sky;2012-06-26 09:32:00;4 minutes;Large, bright ultra white light traveling across the sky A very large, bright white light passed over the sky heading northwest to southeast.  It was a consistent bright ultra white light that traveled at a very consistent speed.  There were no flashing markers, and absolutely no sound at all.  I could compare it against other aircraft in the sky but it did not act like any commercial airplane.  The duration took about 3 minutes to travel across the sky until I lost it to the trees so not horizon to horizon.  Maybe a satellite or an airplane?;32.324294;-96.099686
