It had a yellow glow around it. It was a dark night.  I stopped at a stop sign on a new street in town that cut through pastures.  As I was coming to a stop...I noticed directly in front of me coming up from the pasture an oval shaped object.  It raised up slow, then took off, going up & towards me at the same time.  At first, I didn't know what it was because it was blurry, but then when it flashed up and towards me about 800-1000ft in the air, I knew exactly what it was.  I started crying because it scared me.  It took me awhile to even want to get out of my car when I reached my destination.  I wouldn't be suprised if anyone else would have seen it from another part of town.  I was the only car within 2 miles or so. The funny thing is that I didn't really see any lights on it, it just seemed to have a yellow glow around it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
