Black triangle over Texas.;2017-09-07 22:00:00;10 seconds;Black triangle over Texas. My wife and I had our neighbors over for dinner.  It was about 9:30 or 10:00.  When my neighbor saw this thing just appear.   It was a black triangle the moon was coming up so you could see the outline on the sky.  It had a grid of lights across the bottom, larger ones on the edges.  They were flashing and changing all colors. It moved north to south over the top of the houses in my back yard.  Much bigger than an airplane.   It moved steadily and silently across the sky at a good rate of speed.  We watched it just slowly fad out and disappear at a steady speed.   Their was three of us that witnessed it and it lasted about 15 seconds.;29.6311289156625;-95.7595654618472
