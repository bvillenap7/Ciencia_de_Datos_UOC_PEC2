Bright solid light.;2014-10-08 22:30:00;10 minutes;Bright Solid light Witnessed a very bright, solid white light that resembled a satellite moving slowly from East to West.  Moving very slowly and with no sound.  It looked very similar to previous sightings of the ISS but the object was getting darker as it approached the West horizon (should be the other way around...brighter going towards the sun).   Object was no longer visible once it was too far to the West.;29.6311289156625;-95.7595654618472

It gently passed over me, slowed down, and began circling back. It stopped completely after it began moving back towards me, and the light faded. This happens frequently.;29.6311289156625;-95.7595654618472
