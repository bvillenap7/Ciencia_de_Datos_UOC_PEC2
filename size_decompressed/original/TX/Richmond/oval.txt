A ufo over houston;2002-08-18 19:00:00;8 minutes;A ufo over houston I was outside with my step daughter who is 13 and we were looking at the craters on the moon with my binocolars. She noticed a star moving slowly across the sky silently so I looked through my binocolars and used the zoom and you can clearly see and ovalar shape, a bright yellowish white color with no flashing lights that I can see. It moved slowly to the left then down and right before our eyes it disappeared, just like someone turned off a light. I had a hp digital camera and she went to grab it but the flash didn't work she most likely dropped it earlier. We watched it for about 8 minutes needless to say, my step daughter is now intrested in the sky and wants a telescope.;29.6311289156625;-95.7595654618472
