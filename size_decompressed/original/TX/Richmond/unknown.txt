Started driving towards it it as it just stayed in the same position when we finally got to the road the object was right above the treeline friend was about to record it but we were so in shock that he forgot to press record soon after the object started moving slowly in up moving around, and then zoom it was gone but completely silent also we were in a rural area and it was above a crop field.  It may have landed but again it was a extremely bright light ((NUFORC Note:  Date is not indicated by witness.

Bright light from the North to South and makes 90 degree high speed turn.;2019-11-03 17:45:00;45-50 seconds;Bright light from the North to South and makes 90 degree high speed turn. 10/03/2019   Just after dusk I was sitting on my patio looking up at the sky and the airplanes crossing it.  I noticed one aircraft moving from East to West which is common to see.  It appeared to be at what can described as a normal altitude and speed. I noticed a very bright white light somewhat like a bright star, however it was travelling from the North to the South quite rapidly and looked to be at an extreme altitude.  I thought that seemed out of the norm moving from that direction, and I continued to watch.   The object was moving several times faster than the commercial airliners.    I thought it might be a satellite or the space station and I continued to watch it move towards the South. After approximately 45 seconds or so the object turned to the West at a 90 degree angle without appearing to change its speed.  I still watched the object for a few additional seconds until it disappeared from view. I have no true idea of what it was and I do not recall ever seeing something like that.  I felt uneasy and the hair stood up on my arms.   I went inside to tell my wife what I had just seen and she asked me if I was alright since I had a strange look on my face. Again, no idea what it was, but it was not what I would consider to be a normal experience.;29.6311289156625;-95.7595654618472
