U.F.O. sighting which is unknown to me what I was seeing but it was very bright and round like the moon.;1994-07-15 12:00:00;2 minutes;U.F.O. sighting which is unknown to me what I was seeing but it was very bright and round like the moon. I was not abducted but when we lived in Texas near Dyess Air Force Base my son (who was about 7 years old the year was I believe 1994) we were sitting on our front porch at 20 Field Street in Clyde, Texas.  It was about midnight a hot evening and we sat out most evenings to star gaze.  This particular night I was not really paying attention to much except the cool night air but my little boy looked up by the moon and he said Mamma whats that?   I looked in the direction he stared and saw a brilliant white ball of light (ovulating?  Words to describe it are like it bobbed up and down and swayed like a staggering drunk)  ((oscillating??  PD)) and it made its way past the moon and just under it then in a flash it propelled itself upwards extremley fast and dissapeared.  I don't know what it was but never have I ever seen what I saw that night and not since have I. I only ever saw one that did this in the skies in Clyde but it was not a brilliant ball of light but rather a small white light that when it propelled upwards it looked like a tail of flames coming from it (a meteor perhaps?).  My father was visiting that summer and he saw it.  I remember when we moved to Clyde our neighbors said there were strange lights in the skies but whatever it was it sparks my interest in finding out what it may be.   I hope you understand why I will not leave my real name. There is never any way to prove what my son and I saw that night but I asked him if he remembered and he said he does.  It's been a long time ago and we moved to PA now.  Delete my information if you will but I just thought I would share what I saw.  Take it or leave it.
