I got my two brothers to look and they saw it to.  We were all amazed at what we were seeing. I was so excited,that I went to a neighbor's house to get  someone I knew to come see it. She lived about 15 yards right beside of where our clubhouse was at. My brother said that the object stopped when I was knocking on her door.  When she walked outside my next to oldet brother said it shot off so fast that he only caught a glimpse of it. My neighbor was saying where at, where at! I told her that she just missed it. I didn't see the object stop when I knocked on the door, because I was to focused on trying to get my neighbor to come see it. Although I did see the object move so fast that I barely seen a glimpse of the object.  To end with, I don't know what we saw that night, but the fact that my brother said it stopped made it seem to be a Ufo much more. But believing my brother I don't know so I wished I would have stayed and saw it too. I think this was a Ufo though.;33.598;-95.9076
