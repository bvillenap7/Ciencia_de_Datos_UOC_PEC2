Circle  2 min. A circle of light just above the horizon/ stationary then moved east. My husband and I had just woken up, and I looked out the window.  I saw a light and thought I don't remember a security light there.   because that is kind of what it looked like, without the pole.  We live in the country, so any unusual light would be noticed quckly.  It was stationary.  I asked my husband, What is that?   He looked out, but didn't know either, but suggested that it might be a hellicoptor with bright lights.   Maybe it was, I don't know, but it didn't look like that to me.   And when it moved away the light was the same during the whole event.  In other words, if it had been a light on a aircraft I would have thought you could see the lights direction change, this didn't at all. I had reached over to put on my glasses to see it better when I looked back it continued to hover in the same spot, but then it began its move to the east.   I was facing North, and thought for a moment 'wow, that star is really bright', but then thats when it began to move, so it definately wasn't a star. It's probably nothing, but it did look odd.;33.598;-95.9076
