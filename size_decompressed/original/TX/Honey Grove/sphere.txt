It was clear sky's and visibility was probably 20 miles. It was moving about as fast as a jet would in the sky, but the fact that it had no blinking lights and was just one bright object moving across the sky made me think more that it was a Ufo. I know it wasn't a comet, shooting star, or a meteor because the object was to big to be a shooting star, and was going way to slow. It couldn't be a comet because it would have had a trail of debree. Definetly no meteor just by observation. It was about the size of a quarter if you held it in your hand. So I assume this object was in outer space. The object's direction was from northwest to south east. I lost track of it because it went out of my viewing range.
