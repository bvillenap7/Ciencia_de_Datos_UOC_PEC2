It was moving straight up in the sky and stayed bright for a minute or so then all of a sudden the bright light shut off and it started blinking.... Then it moved fast to the opposite side of where we first spotted it... And it seemed to be hovering in one spot... We didn't hear a sound.. If it were a plane we would have heard it because it moved right over us it seemed... We are still aaahhhed about the whole thing.. Never seen anything like it during the night...
