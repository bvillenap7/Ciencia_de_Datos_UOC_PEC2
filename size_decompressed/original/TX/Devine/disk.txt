Greyish dark spot hovering in the sky on a clear day.;2012-05-12 08:00:00;45 seconds;Greyish dark spot hovering in the sky on a clear day Me and my gf were leaving our house in the car when we got to the stop sign at the end of the street before turning I noticed a dark spot in the sky.  The weather was very clear on this day no clouds in the sky it was dusk right before it gets dark and this object looked like it was just floating hovering in the sky    as I turned turned left on the next county road my gf was the only one who could see it perfectly as I was driving and looking at the same time it looked dark greyish and was shaped like a disc in a way and was not as high as a airplane would be in the air we could see it pretty good.   I blew it off not knowing I could post it and let someone know what I had seen the day is a couple days off.  A tornado had touchdown and destroyed a couple houses on the same street    I witnessed the object on. just a week or 2 after we saw the object not sure how its connected but just thought I would share   we kept driving and after awhile didn't see th object as we got a mile or 2 farther down the road.;29.1564;-98.9091
