It seem to be two tiered with a section on top of the lower section. It was about 1.5' high.  It was rounded smooth at all corners and was the color of polished stainless steel.  It had small black circles at the base of the top section close to where the top met the lower section.  The black circles were equally spaced all the way around.  I saw the object very clearly, and was about 25' off the ground and about 100' away from where I was standing and moving along at about 10 mph.  It had no visible means of propulsion and was silent.  Most UFO sighting are so vague that who knows what they are.  I am not much on being able to draw but could describe it and if someone could draw it I could say exactly that the drawing is correct in every detail.  I think it would be important to have this type of craft documented because there is no doubt what it looks like. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
