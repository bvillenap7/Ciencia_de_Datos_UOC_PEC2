Low flying, slow clump of green lights.;2013-07-04 21:00:00;1-2 minutes;Low flying, slow clump of green lights At a public fireworks display, a few minutes after they stopped the fireworks, and cars were driving away .... there were two groups of 6 to 8 green glowing circular lights...changing position as they slowly floated by ... like a flock of birds, then they seemed to coalesce ... at first you would think fireworks, but it wasnt that ... they were floating very low in the sky, not falling or raising, just floating level. I got in the car to follow them ... then they seemed to be too distant or fade away.;32.7154;-102.6889
