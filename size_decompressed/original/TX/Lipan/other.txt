SOUTH WEST OF LIPAN, TX, ONE ORANGE BALL OF LIGHT SPLITS TO 3, THEN VANISH.;2011-04-04 20:32:00;20 SECONDS;SOUTH WEST OF LIPAN, TX ONE ORANGE BALL OF LIGHT SPLITS TO 3, THEN VANISH. I LIVE IN LIPAN, TEXAS.   AT 8:32 I SAW IN THE SOUTH WEST HORIZON ONE BRIGHT GLOWING ORANGE COLORED BALL.  I THOUGHT ODD BECAUSE I HAD NEVER SEEN A PLANET IN THIS AREA OF THE SKY.   SO I STARED, CONTEMPLATING WHAT IT WAS, AND BEFORE I COULD GO INTO THE HOUSE AND GET MY STAR GAZING MACHINE, IT SPLIT OFF 2 OF EQUAL SIZE, SHAPE, COLOR, AND THEN ALL SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER JUST A BIT, THEN VANISHED AS IF THEY TURNED OFF THEIR LIGHTS.;32.5108;-97.9526
