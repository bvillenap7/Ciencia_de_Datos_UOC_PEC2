I had turned right off of Upland rd. to 1585 in southwest Lubbock had been driving down 1585 for about 45 seconds when my youngest daughter who is twelve began screaming Oh my god  ,Mom,...what is that-fratically..I turned and looked and a pretty good size fire ball was falling westward from the sky my speed may have dropped about five miles an hour at the most but by the time i got three fourths of the way down 1585 to my next turn at 179 it had burned out,when i saw i it at first it was kinda a mix like a streaking rainbow then of blue and purple ..white then red then it was out ...i will say that the colors went like layers and lasted a time with previos colors still visible and so very close...it looked as though it burnd out at bout 100 feet at least......when it burned out i feel like there was a Farm house  and it fell to the west of the house and if there is any debri it will be in that field between 1585 and Woodrow....it was very close.;33.5094;-102.002
