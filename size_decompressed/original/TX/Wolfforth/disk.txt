We could hear the aircraft moving very close and slowly above our home, even rattling the windows.  After debating what the noise could be for a few minutes we went outside to see what it was. We saw about four white lights, equally spaced, rapidly flashing in sequence moving slowly in a diagnal fashion due west.  It was probably about 7-10 miles away but if you put a ruler up to the sky and measure the aircraft would be about 3.5 inches wide.  We called the airport and they said there was a balloon festival in Albequerque, NM and it was probably a balloon.  We know that the lights were all white and flying diagnally and was much larger than a balloon.;33.5094;-102.002
