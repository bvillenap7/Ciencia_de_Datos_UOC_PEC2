Later stopped high in sky and took on constellation-like formation. Saw 100+ solid white glowing objects that first appeared still, but in some type of formation: like a low-lying star constellation.   They then began gliding through the sky silently, moving in formation like a flock of birds.  They flew directly overhead, at a low altitude flying southeast to northwest.   After 10 minutes they made their way higher into the sky and again all took on a constellation-like formation and stopped in their places.  We stood and stared at them for another 20 minutes and they stayed in their exact locations.   Otherwise very cloudy sky-no stars visible.;30.3700000000001;-97.9436999999998
UFO video accidently taken over Lake Travis, Lakeway, TX.  ((NUFORC Note:  Appears to us probably to be an insect.  PD));2017-06-01 18:00:00;10 seconds;UFO  video accidently taken over Lake Travis, Lakeway TX. At 6 to 7 seconds in in 3rd pan camera movement, upper left just above the sun you will see a potential metallic object reflecting off the sun, pass in front of the Sun's brightness, its reflection then is overcome by the sun's brightness until the object reappears below to the lower left and then takes a 30 to 35Â° jog to the right.  Space rocks and satellites do not maneuver like that, it's against the laws of physics, their trajectories are set in motion and can't deviate!  The military does navigate their satellites, they can change direction, never in the way you see in the video.  Could be coincidence but the altitude of the aircraft to the upper right means that it is military.  Notice that you can see contrail but not reflection off its airframe, because it's so small compared to the UFO.  I have 15 years professional experience as a videographer/ photographer. 10 years of which, was with Cox communications.  I know what artifact is.  You will see a lens fl! are which is obvious and normal in a lens as one pans up into the Sun.  A lens flair follows the direction of your pan movement.  The UFO comes down from above in opposite direction of the lens movement and lens flare up.  Also the speed of the object down, is faster than the lens flare up. Keep your curser on pause button to click, to stop and review. I have additional pan movements, in same take, with lens flare moving with the pan up, but no object coming down in frame like this. Also object continues it's variable trajectory down, after pan and lens movement stops. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the anomalous object is an insect in flight.
