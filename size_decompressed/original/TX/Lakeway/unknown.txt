lights over Lake Travis, Austin, TX;2006-07-06 22:30:00;8 min;lights over Lake Travis, Austin, TX The object appeared to be hovering around the Lago Vista area of Lake Travis, Austin, TX.  I observed this from the shore at my friends house in Lakeway, TX.  I am a pilot and tend to look up at aircraft that are overflying.  But this one was very different judging by the span of lights it was too big to be a helicopter. And there were no known  military training activities in the area.  I have not talked to Austin TRACON about this and do not know if it was on radar or not.  But the lights were flashing and steady.  One other person was with me at the the time.  The object did not move for a while and then just disappeared.  It was pretty hard to see but it had to be quite big to emit that kind of light.;30.3700000000001;-97.9436999999998
