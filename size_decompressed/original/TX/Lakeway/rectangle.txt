The craft was  gloss black in color and was floating in a counter clockwise direction. As the craft approached my location I was able to observe the underside. The crafts underside was a yellowish color with what appeared to be a dome like structure underneath which appeared to have a blue and grayish mist-like appearance and was similar to a flourecent glow.  The craft did not make any sound and was approximately 1000-1500 feet above my location.  The craft appeared to have a rectangular to cigar shape apperance and appeared to be about the size of a blimp. The weather conditions for that day was clear blue skies and no clouds. The craft procceded at a slow rate of speed and was visible to me about for about 10 minutes. Only one craft was observed.;30.3700000000001;-97.9436999999998
