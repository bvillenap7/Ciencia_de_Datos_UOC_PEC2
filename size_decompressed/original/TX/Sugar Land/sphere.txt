At first we thought it was the beginning of a storm but the flash occured again though this time it had beams of light that shot out like spotlights.  The beams and light zipped thru the clouds and behind some trees.  We followed to see if a small plane had come down.  As we got closer we could see light illuminating thru the trees and we proceeded to exit the car.  As we got out of the car the lights lifted and rose above the tree line directly in front of us and then above us.  To our shock we saw a sphere like craft with white and red pulsating lights about the size of a garage.  We could make out from the light beams designs in the metal.  The craft paused above us then spun furiously and shot straight up into the clouds again and headed north.  We could see the lights still in the clouds as it ascended and left into the distance.  This was no military craft that we have ever seen before.  But with living near an airforce base we chose to believe maybe it was something experimental.  We took long stares at each other and were quiet on the way home.  The next day we decided not to discuss the matter openly and take our experimental aircraft explanation as the logical explanation, yet we all know what we saw and have yet to see any ship or craft like that so make of that what you will.
