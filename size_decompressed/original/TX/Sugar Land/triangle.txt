Shifting triangular shape object, very high rate of speed, high altitude, traveling due north to south.;2009-10-16 22:00:00;10 seconds;Shifting triangular shape object, very high rate of speed, high altitude, traveling due north to south. Traveling due north to south at very high rate of speed.  Triangle shaped, three small white lights. Orientation of lights shifted from equilateral to irregular triangle to nearly linear.  Impression of high altitude and very large size. No sound heard, very clear night. Saw no trail or any other aircraft in vicinity. Definitely not an aircraft, helicopter, meteor or satellite. I have been a night sky observer for decades and never seen anything like this event.;29.5963204081632;-95.6148595238092
Daytime White Triangle traveling East;2019-07-25 13:45:00;10-15 seconds;Daytime White Triangle traveling East Weather was clear with a very few clouds in the Early afternoon I was traveling North/NorthWest on University Bvld. towards the I69 overpass by the University of Houston Sugar Land Campus  (FYI there is regional airport about 2 miles north)  I witnessed 2 White in color objects flying together traveling East, the first one in my view i did not pay much attention too as i figured it was simply an airplane banking into the nearby airport and maybe the sunlight was catching it funny.  I then saw a second one that looked to be flying relatively close in tandem and could distinctly make out that it was what looked to be a solid white Isosceles Triangle.   I then tried focusing back on the first and unfortunately could still not confirm its shape.  I lost site of the object when i decided to pay more attention to my driving, thusly i did not get a chance to take a picture, i can craft up and provide a map if necessary. My Father was a pilot and i have been around planes since i can remember, this was like no aircraft i have seen outside of science fiction.;29.5963204081632;-95.6148595238092
