Strange red glow in the sky;2003-06-13 10:00:00;5 minutes;Strange red glow in the sky Son was comming in from work and saw about 5 airplanes in sky. Called me out of the house to see. As we looked toward the horizon we saw a bright red object, not moving it was    glowing and the planes were comming from every which way. North, south, east, west. They were all flying toward the bright red light. We heard helicopters far away. My son ran into the house to get his camera, I ran in also to wake my husband, it took all of 30 seconds to do this. When we came out it was gone and we could see search lights in the sky.;29.5963204081632;-95.6148595238092
