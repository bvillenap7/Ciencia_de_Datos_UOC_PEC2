Large oval shaped object seen over Brownsville Texas.;2012-08-10 06:00:00;5 MTS;Large oval shaped object seen over Brownsville Texas. On August 10, 2012, at 5:45 AM CST, an oval/egg shaped bright silver glowing object was seen hovering about 10 feet above the street lights in the Brownsville Country Club.  The object was about 30-50 feet in height and almost same width with a more oval shape.  Object made no sound as it moved/glided very slowly over the neighborhood.  Witness felt watched by the object as it moved in their direction. Witness became frightened and moved indoors. The light could be seen through the windows and front door as it moved slowly by. Witness was left perplexed because it was neither the moon or the sun. The object gave off its own glowing light but its metalic nature could be seen. It was moving South to Northeast based on its movement direction. When light was no longer seen, the Witness went back outdoors and object had either moved on or had disappeared.
