Dome object with natural daylight emission.;2014-07-01 05:30:00;3 minutes;Dome object with natural daylight emission. 	This event happened around 5:10am, as I go in at work at 5:30am.   My mother and I got out of the house that morning,  As I got out of the house and proceed to enter the car with my mother,  I look around my surroundings to see how was the weather, it look hot and dry.   Then as my mother was driving, I notice some fog clouds on the west side of the my view up in the sky.  Then I look around to look for more clouds because the morning was hot and it wasn't any reports of raining.  I notice that there was no clouds around except those on the west side of the sky and they where like only a  little spot, not on the whole sky.   Then while my mother was driving we became aware of a circular dome object that was emerging from those clouds.  The object was very close.  There was no way it could have been an airplane because the object was dome form and suspended on the air very close, it emitted no sound but it emitted a natural daylight light.  But instead of the object havi! ng lights on it. It seem that the actual object itself was emitting that bright light.  What I mean is that the actual metal that formed this object was emitting the light.   I tried to grab my iPhone in order to take a picture, but the object disappear hidden in the clouds.  As we continue to drive I could not spot the object no moreâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Contact information for witness is defective.
