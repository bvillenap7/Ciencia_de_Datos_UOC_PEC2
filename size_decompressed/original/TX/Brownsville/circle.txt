A late night experience of a rotating ball with changing colors, and a aura;1995-11-10 23:45:00;10 minutes;A late night experience of a rotating ball with changing colors, and a aura It was a strange month that year, My wife was pregnant with our second son. I remember a couple of days before seeing the object, I had trouble sleeping, and was having wierd dreams. In my back yard, we have a drainage Ditch,and behind the ditch at that time, we had several thousand acres of farm land. My backyard faces the West, and beyond the farm land runs the highway enter- ing Brownsville,from North to South. I remember that a couple of nights before, while being outside at night, I would see a ball of white light on the other side of the ditch.  I could recall seeing the light barely over the brush along the ditch, but for some strange reason I didn't think about it. I remember seeing it several times, and it did stand out, but for some reason I didn't check it out. But then on that night, I Decided to take my dog,(a Great Dane) for a walk, I would walk her probably every other night that month, late at night. It was a cool night, and it was clear skies, I walked to the back yard, when again I saw this light, It apeared to be moving slowly up and down. This time I became aware of how this light was strange, and out of place. The light at that moment looked like a street light, I went to the ditch for a better look, as I got closer, I could not see it, because of the brush.  The Ditch on the other side is higher than the side I was standing on, so I was trying to figure out how I could get a better view.  As I stood there, this bright light shot up from where I had seen the light, It was the size of a golf ball at arms lenth,this is the best I could describe it.  It seemed to be rotating, and changing colors, It was not very bright, as bright as a 40 watt light bulb.  You could see like vapor, like when you look at gasoline, is the best way I could describe it, you could see the colors change as it rotated, I can't remember though which way it was rotating(sorry), but it was rotating horizontally. My dog also noticed it, she was scared but did not bark, She had her tail between her legs. I stood there for about 15 seconds, trying to figure out what it was, but then I became scared, And I ran inside the house thru the front door, with the dog. I remember telling my self, that no one was going to believe me about what I saw, So I ran into the bedroom and woke my wife up, I dragged her outside thru the sliding door going to my back yard. My wife didn't know what was going on, I guess I was pretty excited, but she saw it also, but this time, it was starting to move to the Northwest slowly. It seemed to be shrinking in size, It got to the size of a pea at arms lenth. I had built a elivated platform for my son, so I climbed it, and watched it, as it dropped behind some trees in the far distance Northwest of my home. At the time I didn't believe in ufo's, I was just a regular Joe, Didn't really give it to much thought, but now I have become a strong believer. Thank You, PS My wife was 6 months pregnant at the time;25.929794069343;-97.4662918795614
shiny chrome metallic craft;2005-02-13 16:45:00;10 seconds;shiny chrome metallic craft It was a beautiful sunny day with lots of white clouds. Tempreture was around 85 degrees. Two of my friends and I were playing golf. We were driving our carts towards the green when I just so happened to take a glance at the sky and saw this circular craft that was chrome looking and very, very shiny and moving slowly into the clouds. At the same time my friend was asking me a question. I took my eyes off the craft for a second to look at my friend and answer his question. I thought to myself I'll catch it again once it comes out the other side of the cloud. It never did. I quickly told my friends about what I saw and asked them to help me spot it in the sky. It never showed up again. If it was a plane or balloon it should've pass through the clouds and reveiled itself on the other side of the clouds. NOTHING! At the same time when I saw it I had a strange feeling inside, I can't describe it. It was definitely strange.;25.929794069343;-97.4662918795614
2 orange fiery, round objects flew over brownsville, tx near east price road.;2013-10-28 20:20:00;1.5 minutes;2 orange fiery, round objects flew over brownsville, tx near east price road The neighbors and I saw them.  They were 2 round objects, fiery irange in color and they looked like balls of fire.  We thought they were comets because they were going down like falling but then they stopped falling, suspended in mid air, kept flying and the lighting changed from fiery to just lighted orange.

THE OBJECT WAS ROUND, BRIGHT LIGHT AND JUST WENT UP STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR IN LESS THAN 5 SECONDS;2019-10-11 03:00:00;<2 minutes;THE OBJECT WAS ROUND, BRIGHT LIGHT AND JUST WENT UP STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR IN LESS THAN 5 SECONDS LOCATION OF SIGHTING WAS ON 10/11/2019 AT 3:00AM IN BROWNSVILLE TEXAS BETWEEN 12TH AND 13TH STREET IN EMPTY LOT. AS I WAS ASLEEP THE SOUND OF STRONG WINDS WOKE ME UP. I WAS THINKING IT WAS THE A/C COMPRESSOR GOING OUT OF ORDER AND MAKING LOUD NOISE. I WENT TO CHECK THE FRONT DOOR TO THE HOUSE TO CHECK A/C COMPRESSOR AND NOTHING. I WENT TO BACK DOOR FACING THE ALLEY AND SAW BRIGHT, STRONG LIGHT ALONG WITH STRONG WINDS GOING IN CIRCLES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EMPTY LOT OF THE BACK OF OUR HOUSE. AS I OPEN THE DOOR IT WAS MORE SCARY TO SEE AND WITNESS A BRIGHT LIGHT AND WINDS WITH PRESSURE JUST GOING IN CIRCLES. IT WAS NO HELICOPTER. IT WAS A VERY BRIGHT ROUND OBJECT. AS I FAST CLOSE THE DOOR AND LOOKED THROUGH MY KITCHEN WINDOW WHICH WAS LESS THAN 5 SECONDS THE LIGHT STARTED TO DECREASE AS IT SHOWED HOW IT JUST WENT UP STRAIGHT UP INTO THE AIR. THE LIGHT WAS SO VERY BRIGHT AND NOISE WAS LOUD. I AM STILL IN SHOCK TO HAVE WITNESS THIS AND THINK PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIE! VE ME IF I WAS TO MAKE A REPORT TO POLICE. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I AM TELLING THE TRUTH AND NEED FOR SOMEONE TO COME AND CHECK THE SCENE FOR ANY KIND OF EVIDENCE. I AM EVEN AFRAID TO GO OUTSIDE. I BEG TO PLEASE DO AN INVESTIGATION REFERENCE TO THIS SERIOUS MATTER.;25.929794069343;-97.4662918795614
