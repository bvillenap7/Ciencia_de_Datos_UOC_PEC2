Light, like a star moving fast and staright.;2000-01-18 01:15:00;30 sec.;Light, like a star moving fast and staright. It was a very cold night, you could see your breath. I pulled off at road side park on highway 70, just north of Blackwell Tx. I turned off the truck and got out, It was very dark and the stars were bright.I noticed that I was looking at the cluster or the milkey way, because there was a ban of stars, and I could see very small stars that are usually difficult to see. Then I noticed a object or a light, about the same intensity of a star moving very quickly south to north, this light was not as fast as a falling/shooting star, but faster than a aircraft. the light was moving in a straight, uniformed direction, and did not turn or slow down. (Steady Speed). Then I lost sight of it as it went behind trees.;32.082;-100.3111
Slowly moving red/gold glowing orb.;2019-03-18 06:45:00;7 minutes;Slowly moving red/gold glowing orb. A bright, glowing orb was first seen about 10 degrees above the western horizon beneath Spica.  It alternated colors in an 8 second cycle of red-invisible-gold-invisible-red as it moved slowly north, taking about 5 minutes to reach a point beneath Denebola.   It was brighter than the planet Jupiter that was visible in the southern sky.   The orb continued to move silently northward at the same altitude until it disappeared from sight behind a building.;32.082;-100.3111
