Multi-colored pulsing light in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus is in the northwest sky, at the time indicated.  PD));2010-07-24 00:50:00;5 minutes;Multi-colored pulsing light in sky For the second time this week, I observed an unusual object in the western sky at about the same place and time.  It looks like a very bright star, appears about 30 degrees above the horizon, moves Very slowly towards the northwest.  Looks to be stationary at times, then continues to move very slowly, then it disappears.    The distance traveled is about the width of your little finger held up at arms length and the time is around 5 minutes. The unusual part is that it sometimes appears to be 2-3 bright lights and it pulses different colors almost like an array of colors, red, yellow/amber, green, blue, white.  I wouldnâ€™t say that it blinks, but it is more of a pulsing bright to less bright, all the while changing colors.   Tonight it appeared at about 12:50 a.m.  3-4 days ago it appeared at about 1:05 a.m. I am located in Kingwood, Texas, which is about 20 miles north east of Houston.
