White-green fast moving disc;2004-06-19 03:23:00;1min;White-green fast moving disc Object was far away probably not even my county, but it was a very clear night and I noticed a white-green light hovering above the horizen northeast of Kingwood,TX. Object had a disc shape and moved slow when I first sighted it. I watched the object hover around and then in a burst of speed left to the north. My freind and I both looked at each other {we had both seen it}. I have never seen any flying object accelerate so perfectly and effortlessy. No sound was heard. This object was definitely not civilian/military.;30.0529;-95.1782999999998
Disk of light with a crescent of rainbow colored lights;2019-12-19 15:45:00;5 minutes;Disk of light with a crescent of rainbow colored lights I was taking my grandchildren home from school yesterday, 12/19/2019.We were traveling west along Northpark Dr. in Kingwood, Texas at about 3:45 or so in the afternoon.We were caught in slow moving traffic, and I noticed the most unusual sight. At first I thought I was looking at the sun through cloud cover.  On the left side of the sun-like object there was a crescent of rainbow colored light covering maybe the disk, like the sliver of a crescent moon.  The rainbow light glowed a bit outside of the disk area. I thought it was the sun and maybe there were ice crystals in the atmosphere diffracting the light making the very unusual image.  Then I looked around the solid part of the windshield and noticed the actual sun shinning further south.  It was close to the disk.  I really don't know how far away it was. The disk did not move or change.  It held its perfectly disk-like shape for several minutes.  I asked the girls to look at the disk and the sun, making sure that my mind wasn't playing tricks on me.  They both saw the same thing. By the time I could get to my purse and phone, the image was fading.  It didn't zoom away or disappear, it just faded.  But the perfect round geometic form never morphed. I don't know what this was, but in all of my 62 years I have never seen anything like it. Thanks so much for having a site like this.Peace. --;30.0529;-95.1782999999998
