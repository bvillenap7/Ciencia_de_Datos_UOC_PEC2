Total of 5 deep orange/yellow lights floated across the sky, too close together to be airplanes, made no sound, & were following a path;2015-04-03 20:25:00;Few minutes (maybe 2-3;Total of 5 deep orange/yellow lights floated across the sky, too close together to be airplanes, made no sound, & were following a path There were at first 3, yellow/deep orange bright lights, too close together and too small to be airplanes, and they were moving slightly north and more west.   They at first looked small enough to just be a nearby planet or for some reason large star, but then I realized they were moving and were definitely neither of those.  As I watched the first three, somewhat fireball-like lights move across the sky, a fourth peeked up behind the tree line in front of me and was following the other 3 (who happened to be in a group somewhat like a triangle shape).  Eventually a fifth light came from the treeline, still following the other 4.  They all remained in the air, seemingly high in the atmosphere, until they either turned a different way and we could not see the light or they dimmed out, it was hard to tell.  But soon after seeing the fifth one, two of the first 3 began to quickly dim and distinguish. There was no sound, only light.;30.0529;-95.1782999999998
3 fireballs flying in a triangle.;2019-04-16 20:30:00;2 minutes;3 fireballs flying in a triangle. Kingwood, Texas, April 16, 2019.   Around 8:30 pm I was walking my dog when I saw three bight orange/red fireballs flying in a triangle.  two more followed but separately.  I live 10 miles from a major airport.  I see and hear planes all the time.  This was no plane.  I heard nothing.  They did this twice. Unfortunately.  I didnâ€™t have my phone with me to film it.  This was my first time to ever see anything like this, I hope I do again.;30.0529;-95.1782999999998
