Organic Buttefly Shaped UFO.;2013-07-29 22:40:00;1-3 seconds;Organic Buttefly Shaped UFO. I was walking back from the community dumpster and happened to look up above the tree line. Roughly 40ft above the tallest tree a pure white organic/living butterfly like shape UFO flouted over the trees and as soon as I saw it, the UFO became skittish/nervous like and disappeared.  The UFO did not dart off, but instead turned off like a light switch blacking out.  The UFO was about 60-80 feet in length, nonmetallic but instead organic or as if it was actually living.  The UFO was perfectly symmetrical, all white and with two tails.  The incident lasted no longer then a few seconds, and after seeing the UFO black out, my eyes began to feel a slight discomfort and irritation which continued throughout the next day.  The UFO did not make a sound.;30.0529;-95.1782999999998
