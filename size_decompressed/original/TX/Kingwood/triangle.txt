Two triangular metallic objects moving across the sky approaching dusk;2004-09-13 19:15:00;15 -20 sec;Two triangular metallic objects moving across the sky approaching dusk Two triangular (rounded edges), metallic objects traveling in straight line to the north-northwest at a fairly rapid pace.  Sunlight glinted off the objects.  Objects were slowly spinning around each other in half to full circles and reversing directions.  Part of the time they weren't spinning.  Moved in straight line, maintaining a steady speed.  Lost sight of them when they went beyond the treeline. Would be interested to see if anyone else saw it, since I live in a heavy populated area..;30.0529;-95.1782999999998
