I was driving south on Loop 494 between Royal Crossing Drive and Kingwood Drive, near the entrance to the Homewood Suites Hotel. The entire sky suddenly became brightly lit in a bluish color. This lasted approximately 1 second. Another second passed and then the entire sky was lit again but in the pattern of 2-3 large beams as if the light were coming from the horizon line. This was too large and too bright to have been any type of spotlight. Approximately 5 minutes later I was driving north on Forest Cove drive and a bright blue object (the same shade the lit sky was) flew through the sky in a large arch. The light was traveling very fast. The light seems to blink and then disappeared. I had a passenger in the front seat who also saw both events.;30.0529;-95.1782999999998
Ball of silent light doing circular patterns.;2013-09-20 06:00:00;10 minutes;Ball of silent light doing circular patterns I went out to walk my dog and happened to look up.  There was a ball of silent light flying around in circles.  It would go behind a cloud and then pop back out flying in circular patterns.  Lots of planes fly near my area, and a couple passed by as the ball was flying around.I know it was not a plane.  I assume it was one object because I never saw two at once but with it weaving in and out of the clouds it is possible that there were more than one just not visable all at the once.   I ran inside and came back out and tried to get video but it did not turn out.;30.0529;-95.1782999999998
