I dismissed it initially but it occurred a second time in the exact same position. I noted that the reflection seemed to change shape from left crescent to circular then right crescent then disappear.  Not fast but over a period of several seconds. The reflection was unnaturally bright.  The flash which I watched, occurred 3 times in rhythm. After the second rotation I  grabbed my phone to set it up to shoot video. Before getting my phone set to proper mode the third series occurred just as the previous two. Exact same position..  No change in elevation or other detectable movement in any direction. Each time the object would completely disappear. No visible shape of anything could be seen until the next series of crescent circular crescent reflections occurred. This was no balloon, plane or anything I've ever seen before.  What prompted me to report it, is the intensity of the light.  The brightness was so unusual that it made me feel like I was witnessing a very unique object.  My disappointment in the cessation was pretty great because I wanted to capture at least one series of reflection on video.  Not that it would have shown as clearly as I witnessed but to capture the intensity and sighting period.;30.892;-102.8782
