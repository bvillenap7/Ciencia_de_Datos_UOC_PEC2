Looks to be three lights in a diamond shape with a strobing light going from l to r.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet??  PD));2012-01-29 21:15:00;Hours;Looking through boniculars, the ufo looks to be three lights in a diamond shape with a strobing light going from left to right through the middle.  Hasn't moved since i first spotted it at 9:15p.m.  It is now 10:12p.m. Seems to be at least 50 miles away from town. A friend i told about looked also and said he noticed another strange light doing the same a little to the left of other object. I am not able to see the second object cause of buildings obstructing my view.;30.892;-102.8782
