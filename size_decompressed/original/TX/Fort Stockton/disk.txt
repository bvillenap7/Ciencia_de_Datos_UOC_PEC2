Saucer Sighting in Fort Stockton, Texas 02/2003;2003-02-15 19:00:00;45 secs;Saucer Sighting in Fort Stockton, Texas 02/2003 I was driving from Lordsburg, New Mexico to Fort Stockton, Texas.  It was getting toward evening - probably late afternoon.  I saw two disks(?).  I couldn't believe it.  I was saying, I see you, I see you.  Then they disappeared behind the clouds.  Sometimes I think maybe it must have been something else, but then I know what I saw wasn't normal.  I've told very few people about this.  But, tonight as I was flipping channels, the SciFi Channel was airing a show Proof Positive and a familiy was mentioning a UFO sighting in Fort Stockton.  So, I feel I should report it somewhere.  Maybe I'm one of many people to have seen something around Fort Stockton.  Oh, I was on Interstate 10.  Well, I guess this isn't much, but that's it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
