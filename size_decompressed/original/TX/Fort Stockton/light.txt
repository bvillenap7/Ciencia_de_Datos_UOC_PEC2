I asked if there were any radio antennas or lights in the area and she shook her head and told me that if there were, she wasn't aware of it. That's when we noticed the lights dart across the sky towards our direction. She stopped the car, killed the lights, and we watched as the three red lights darted over and around the car silently, as they faded to orange and back to red. After around 10 minutes, they disappearted as quickly as they appeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));30.892;-102.8782
