Large triangular shaped craft in sky at dusk;2014-05-19 21:15:00;8 minutes;Large triangular shaped craft in sky at dusk I live in the country, and was closing the gate after returning home last night.  I looked up and saw a large, triangular shaped craft moving north to south.  It was moving at a steady speed.  It was lit up around the edges with white lights.  It made no sound whatsoever. Since it was at dusk, I could clearly see the outline of the craft, although the craft was below what sunlight was still coming over the horizon.  It continued south without incident until it could no longer be seen.  Size estimation, across the base of the triangle, at least the wingspan of a C-5 Galaxy.;29.4353;-98.1995000000001
