mysterious object;2005-09-16 22:30:00;24:00;mysterious object I went outside to enjoy the full moon, and noticed an orange colored object low in the east. I thought it was just a plane or hellicopter, but it seem to just sit there. I called to my grandson,, and went to get the binoculars, but we couldn't make it out. it seem to drift and bobble closer and closer for a long while then it went higher and higher. the color seem to dim as it got closer, but as I write, I can still see it, but now just looks like a bright star. I saw the same thing about a month ago, but it shot throught the air and disappeared similar to a meteor. I never heard of a meteor at that time on the news. This one just sits here hovering, high above us now.;32.2984;-97.023
