At approximately 23:30 on Tuesday the 30th of October, 2012, I spotted two triangular flying objects high in the sky flying rather close to each other.  They had three lighted orbs on the bottom that was visible and was an orange like color.   They flew at a constant speed and they didn't have any blinking lights like mostly any other commercial aircraft.  I observed it for a duration of three minutes until they were no longer in my sight.   This was my first sighting of a UFO!;32.48;-96.9904999999999
