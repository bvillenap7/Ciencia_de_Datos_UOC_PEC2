In the last hour myself and 2 of my son's have witnessed 12 different star looking lights moving, flying erratically across the sky in various directions, but at very high altitudes. They were very similar to the space shuttle we witnessed last week. These lights were all seen at different times, all within one hour. Two were witnessed at once traveling from north to norteast. They were of considerable distance apart, and I could not be sure if they were traveling together. From my location I am located approximately 75 miles south of DFW airport, and directly under the flight path from Dallas to Houston, San Antonio, and Austin. We get alot of air traffic here including the big helicopters I hear are headed for President Busch's ranch just 50 miles sw of here, as well as various other aircraft in the very large sky I am privy to every night. In the last week we have spotted approximately 25 unknown flying objects, and we have witnessed these lights off and on for the last 5 or so years but only with the frequency of about 2 or 3 a year. These ufo's are called such because the erratic flight of these lights. They frequently stop, start, veer left and right, speed up and slow down frequently. The light can travel across the sky as quick as 30 secs. or so, and take as long as 5 mins. I have always been a little skeptical as to ufo's, for I have all my life looked to the stars. Now I'm convinced, and as I have been writing this my son has reported seeing another two more lights.;32.0179;-97.1231
