I was looking at what I thought might be a very bright planet in the northwest sky, located at approximately 45 deg. above the horizon. The light then began moving further northwest slowly at first and then very quickly left to right and then up and down very rapidly but in a very erratic fashion. It moved left to right in a wide 180 deg. movement across the horizon and then up and down in about a 45 degree movement above where it had been originally positioned and then back down again. The erratic fashion in which it moved can only be described as if a leaf were falling to the earth moving quickly back and forth as it falls. Another interesting thing is that it changed colors when it moved. While stationary it was a very bright white light, but when it moved it turned blue and then blue green in color. As soon as it stopped and became stationary, it turned white. I had never seen anything quite like this before and watched it for about an hour and a half before it slowly moved to the Northwest and disappeared over the horizon. I had hoped it would come closer to my position so that I might get a better look at what it was. I told my family about it and am still being teased about what I saw, but I know what I saw, I just don't know what it was. I had no camera to offer proof. I was in a very remote high plains desert location, with the nearest town(Spring Lake) being about 22 miles further north of my position. this occured at 9:45 p.m. and I observed it until about 11:20 p.m. Spring Lake, Texas is about 40 miles North of Ozona, Texas. It is a very remote and sparsely populated area.;31.4145;-101.5456
