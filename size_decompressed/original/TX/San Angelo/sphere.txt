There are in the sky in 4 different directions balls of light that have flashing lights of red green and blue.  They are a long way off but very obvious through a spotting scope.  They look like spheres of neon lights in the vegas tradition.  We had our friend a us customs official witness and then inquire about the objects with different government radar and observation sites around the area and all said that there is nothing visible to them on radar.;31.456406741573;-100.452091573034
4 silent, unidentitified objects over San Angelo.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect lens flares, caused by street lamp.  PD));2017-03-21 20:03:00;1 minute;4 silent, unidentitified objects over San Angelo From the HEB store parking lot just after 8pm, taking two pictures of the haboo dirt storm rolling into San Angelo from the West. From March 21, 2017, at 8:03 PM. ISO 400, f 2.2, focal length 4.80mm.  Samsung SM-G900V camera.  Both photos show a group of 4 orbs/spheres shaped objects in a group on the edge of the dirt storm clouds.  There is a colored aura around the objects in the second picture. They were silent, and not even seen by my naked eye, only visible in the 2 pictures of the dirt storm front.  Both pictures were taken within 1 minute.  The 4 objects moved at least 15 degrees and become more visible in the second picture. There was no sound of jet engines or afterburners aimed at me as it appears.  San Angelo has a U.S. Air Force base, so it could  possibly be stealth technology. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect lens flares, caused by street lamp.  PD));31.456406741573;-100.452091573034
Ball of light followed the Concho River.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-12 18:10:00;15 minutes;Ball of light followed the Concho River. I was heading from north to south on Abe Street, when I spotted this thing.  According to my watch, it was just after six in the evening.  Off to my right, this bluish white ball looked as if it were descending towards the Concho River. As I approached Santa Fe Park, the ball of light made a hard banking turn and continued to descend over the river.  The object traveled from west to east.  Checking the rearview mirror, I could tell that the drivers behind me knew something was going on.  The car behind me began to slow down.  After making Santa Fe Park Dr., I proceeded west. En route to pickup my daughter, I didn’t want to be late.  But this thing was headed straight towards me.  Estimating, I would say the object was no more than 700 feet from the ground.  Blue-white in color and the thing sort of flickered, like an image on a television screen sometimes does. But it was that banking turn, like this thing just rolled onto course and followed the bend in the river.  Thirty feet in diameter, and it wasn’t travelling very fast.  In fact, it passed me slowly as it continued eastward. I’m not sure what speed it was travelling at.  The thing went by silently.
