Three white light plasma craft (w intelligent thought) sped across Texas sky and the shot up into atmosphere.;1970-09-10 21:30:00;20 seconds;Three white light plasma craft (w intelligent thought) sped across Texas sky and the shot up into atmosphere. San Angelo, TX is the home of Goodfellow AFB - a Top Secret/NSA/Tri-service training facility. West Texas. Sheep country.  I had a Air Force Top Secret Crypto (very high) security clearance at the time.  A fellow male trainee and I along with my wife exited an apartment in San Angelo and were walking toward my car to go out to dinner. Goodfellow AFB is not too far from the apartment complex.  It was dark, starry night. Big Texas sky, flat horizon country. No clouds.  As we were walking to the car, we all three looked over our shoulder at the same time and saw up in the sky near the high cloud level (no clouds), three bright white plasma craft in formation (the size of .5 inch each) moving rapidly across the sky. They stopped allowed us to gaze on them and then shot perpendicular straight up in the sky in a split second (extremely high rate of speed) and disappeared in the atomosphere. We all looked at each other and our thoughts were What was that?  In addition, what I remember the most was the objects had a kind of intelligence. Thought intelligence. As if they wanted us to turn around and see them. Then, when we did they took off.  Goodfellow AFB is not an aircraft base. It is a NSA (and military intelligence) training center. So, there were no Air Force jet aircraft in the vicinity no matter what time of day.  The other airman I was with became a Baptist Minister and to this day denies he ever saw anything (against his religion). My wife (ex-wife) married again and lives in Washinton State. I have no contact with her.  I am writing this as a result of the CoasttoCoastAM radio broadcast April 9, 2004.  I would have written to you soon, but I thought you wanted reports on recent sightings.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We would like to have all UFO sightings reported to our Center, irrespective of the date of occurrence.  PD));31.456406741573;-100.452091573034

18 lights travel over San Angelo sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2010-05-02 21:58:00;2 minutes;18 lights travel over San Angelo sky At approximately 9:58pm, my family and I  witnessed moving lights travel in the sky in a pattern.  Two lights would appear, one light in the lead and one light trailing.  The lead light would fade up into night and the trailing light would disappear in about the same place and then 1 to 2 seconds later two more lights would appear following the same flight pattern.  We witnesses a total of 18 lights.  It looked like moving stars.  It did not look like star link lights.;31.456406741573;-100.452091573034
Ultra bright ball of light flying very low over texas.;2010-07-12 23:00:00;7-12 seconds;Ultra bright ball of light flying very low over texas. Second story of apartment complex.  Looking south east as high as you can possibly see thick cloud coverage no stars in sight.  No distractions to my pervisional vision as far as street or car lights, could I confuse this sighting with an image of an ultra bright white ball falling downwards at great speed than any air craft made.  Zig zagging from left to right and kept falling until out of my sight. I saw a ultra brigtht light seconds after being called outside, falling at an incredible speed downwards while zig zagging from left to right.  The object kept falling until it was out of my sight.;31.456406741573;-100.452091573034
Three faint lights flying in formation while traveling at enormous speed across the nigth sky.;2010-09-01 21:50:00;30 seconds;Three faint lights flying in formation while traveling at enormous speed across the nigth sky. Just before 10pm tonight, we went outside to look at the sky and feed our cat. My wife was holding our 19 month old daughter looking at the stars and yelled, LOOK!.  She was looking directly up and we saw 3 lights flying perfectly in line across the sky.  They were traveling 10X faster than any aircraft in the sky.  Shortly after we saw them, they formed a triangle for about 10 seconds, then bunched together at the end and disappeared into the sky after a plane appeared to be close to them.  These objects were very faint (high altitude) and were heading southwest. We’ve never seen or reported anything like this and it was amazing ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));31.456406741573;-100.452091573034
Light of star turns on and off in two different positions with no visible movement between the two sightings.;2013-11-06 20:05:00;30 seconds;Light of star turns on and off in two different positions with no visible movement between the two sightings. On Wednesday, 6 November 2013 about 2005 in the evening, I went out to my back yard in San Angelo, TX, and was admiring the clear night sky with a crescent moon and lots of stars.  The moon was lower in the horizon, and I looked straight up to look at the stars. As I was looking up, the light of one of those “stars” appeared to just “turn off.”  There was no movement at all involved with this “star,” and it appeared very distant in space like the other stars.   I thought that was strange, and I kept looking up to see if the light would “turn back on.” Well, the light did “turn back on” about 10 seconds later, only  I would guess about 20 degrees due south/southeast from where I first saw it.  The light was back on only for about 5 seconds, then it was off again.   I kept looking if I would see it again along the same trajectory, but I never saw it again.  Between these two sightings, there was no visible path, no blinking lights, no movement, etc. What was so unusual about this sighting was that there was no motion involved when I saw the “star” those two times, and it appeared as distant as the other stars in the sky with similar light intensity and character.  In both instances, the light “just turned off,” and there was no visible path whatsoever. I have admired the nighttime sky for many, many years and am familiar with what airplanes, satellites, the space station, the shuttle, etc. all look like when I look up, this is nothing like I have ever seen before.;31.456406741573;-100.452091573034
Orange light in the sky.;2014-08-09 23:30:00;3 minutes;Orange light in the sky. At approximately 11:30 pm, I witnessed a bright orange light to the northwest, right above the elementary school.  It was moving from west to east at a fairly decent speed.   I noticed the orange light starting to pulsate when it was crossing directly in front of me.  Then the light just disappeared.

Yellow/golden with multiple lights hovering in sky for 20 minutes then just vanished.;2020-02-22 21:00:00;15 minutes;Yellow/golden with multiple lights hovering in sky for 20 minutes then just vanished. Four people, adults in 60’s and 70’s, saw NW 30-degree azimuth in night sky over San Angelo, TX on February 22, 2020. It was like a huge star in the sky but with several distinct lights.  Possibly four lights in a diamond shape with two lights trailing.  Looked like a star low in the sky at first, but much larger.  We could see it from the car as we drove four or five miles back to home also in the same town.  The object did not move.  Stayed in the same place as we watched.  It was not a star – we could see stars above us in the sky clearly. These lights were golden in color.  We got out of the car and still could see the light clearly.  Our neighbors were frightened and went inside their house. We went out in our car to try to find it, driving toward Lake Nasworthy. But the light had vanished. It was just gone. We saw it clearly, and it was very large, for about 20 minutes. Then it was just gone.;31.456406741573;-100.452091573034
