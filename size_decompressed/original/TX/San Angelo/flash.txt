When I awoke I looked out the back and the front. I saw a flashing light in the distance. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));2012-01-15 03:59:00;until morning;When I awoke I looked out the back and the front. I saw a flashing light in the distance.  I walked outside and felt a creapy feeling. I looked for a while through the window and the lights started flashing higher in the sky and it made me kinda dizzy.   I went back to bed and woke again an hour later and it was still there.   When I woke about 8:30 it was gone.  Several years ago I saw 3 triangle shaped crafts in a triangle formation toward the back of my house in the distance.   That night the radio tower they were near collapsed.  A new one has been built still a distance away from by house. I live on a dead-end street out in the country. The field where the flashing light was is just farm and ranch land.  No one should have been out there and the light was too bright for farm equipment and it was not moving, only standing still and flashing and the hour later when I awoke it was in the same spot.;31.456406741573;-100.452091573034
