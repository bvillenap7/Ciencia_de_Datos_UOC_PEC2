I parked my car and got out to see what this could be. It began moving and came right over my house, the distance was like a low flying airplane, but this was NOT an airplane.  It was bright orange and pulsating and made no noise at all.  It was moving south to north.  As it was going over my house it was picking up speed.  I called my son on his phone to come out and see this, but within a few seconds this object was gone.  I watched it as it kept going in a straight south to north direction and it just disappeared.  I have never seen anything like this before in my life. I would love to know if anyone else saw this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Daylight sighting in San Angelo (oval);2010-11-21 18:00:00;15-20 sec.;Daylight sighting in San Angelo(oval) At approx. 18:00 hrs. I stepped out to the back deck for a smoke. As I sat in my beach chair leaning back I noticed two hawks or buzzards in a thermal at approx. 1500 ft. Looking beyond them I noticed another object farther up and hovering at approx. 5-6000 ft. It looked to the size of a small airplane but with no wings and just sitting there. The birds had moved to the east by now and it was just this thing hanging up there , I looked away and looked back to make sure it was not something on my eyes . (floaters)  I called out to my son to bring a camera and as I was waiting for him said object shot to the west. The object moved from 0 mph to out of sight in less than one second. If I had blinked I would thought it had just vanished but, it moved so fast it actually left a trail of darkness behind it as if it were a tracer. I have never seen anything move that fast in the daylight. The best way I could even describe the speed is to say it left a line in the sky as it shot westward. I'm reporting this as I know another sighting was reported in this town at a later time. My wife and son have had two other sightings in the last 14 months at this location but, they were night sightings.;31.456406741573;-100.452091573034
