Purple light flashing, mostly red light.;2014-03-07 20:15:00;15 minutes;Purple light flashing, mostly red light. Came in to view as purple, almost disregarded it as a plane and the it took a 90 degree turn.   As it came to a stop it turned red and would flash a purplish light randomly to my understanding.   We watched it for about ten more minutes and then it headed north.;31.456406741573;-100.452091573034
