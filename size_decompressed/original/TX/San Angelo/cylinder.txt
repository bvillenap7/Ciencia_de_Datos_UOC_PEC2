large cylinder hanging motionless in the sky;2004-04-15 11:00:00;5 MIN.;large cylinder hanging motionless in the sky It was after a thunder storm as i headed west toward the San Angelo city limits.  As i drove i studied the clouds and open sky. In a large open area in the sky i saw what appeared to be a short white jet stream lingering from a passing jet.  As i continued to drive, i kept looking up at the object, it not only hadn't changed shape or faded as a jet stream would, it on the otherhand became clear that i was looking at a solid cylinder shape. It seamed to be at approx. 30,000 ft. and looked like a cigaret suspended in mid air at about 10 ft. distance. The road turned and i went under an overpass. When i creared the overpass, i looked for the object but it wasn't there. I studied the cloudy sky, when suddenly in the opposite direction, i saw a huge gray, blunt end cylinder hanging part way out of a large dark cloud. The sun was glaring against it and i couldn't see any windows or markings. I continued driving and looking back as it hung there monionless. I didn't have a camera, but i wish i would have stopped, maby someone would have stopped with a camera. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.
