It was the year 1998 in San Angelo, Texas.  I went outside  because there was nothing to do inside. When I looked in the sky I saw a very big glowing red glowing fireball moving accross the sky with no sound. The moon was out too, it looked about a little smaller than the moon, it was big.  The fire ball had a really long tail connected trailing behing it. As the ball continued to move accross at a really slow pace,  about the same speed  and height as a plane moves accross the sky, this was no plane though it looked like a big comet or meteor.  I have never seen any thing like that before, and I've seen a few comets and meteors.  AS the ball moved accross the sky, the tail stayed glowing red and stretched accross the sky as far as I could see.  I wanted to call my mom who was asleep at the time inside.  But I didnt want to wake her.It lasted about an hour, the tail stayed lit a little longer after the ball kept going out of sight.  The tail just faded away real slowly afterwards.  I could tell it looked like it wasn't falling down to Earth, it just kind of looked like it kept going around the world.  I looked for some pictures on the net of what it looked like but found nothing.  IT looked like a comet but alot bigger and closer.  Pluse it was red and glowing, not blue.  I thought it might have been a spaceshuttle taking off but now I have seen how they take off, strait up in the air not accross the sky.  To this day I dont know what it was.  I have never seen it again I dont think it was an alien thing or nothing like that, just a UFO.  This is the truth, if anyone else has seen anything the same please say something.  I'm just trying to figure out what it was. This was in south side San Angelo around 1997 and 1998.  I was in an urban area so someone else had to have seen it.;31.456406741573;-100.452091573034
