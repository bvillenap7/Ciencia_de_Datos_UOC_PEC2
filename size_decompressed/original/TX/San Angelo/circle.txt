It can't be an Airplane or Star, so what is it ?;2010-07-15 20:40:00;2 Hrs.;It can't be an Airplane or Star ,so what is it? My 11 yr. old was crossing the street at 8:40 pm and yelled that he sees a shooting star, my friend and I got up and went to the road and looked up and watched this object shoot across the sky the same distance from one side of the cresent moon to the other and then it stopped and hasn't moved anymore.  At first we thought it was an airplane but then it stopped, that puzzled us so we kept watching and it has moved a little bit from where it stopped.  I don't think it was Venus because Venus doesn't move.  The object was round and had lights that criss crossed.  Now it just sits there and dims then gets bright.;31.456406741573;-100.452091573034
