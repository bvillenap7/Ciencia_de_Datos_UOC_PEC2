Iwas driving and looking almost directly west at the time. It was moving slowly from left to right (south to north) in the direction of Alliance Airport. I couldnt see it clearly because it seemed to be shifting somehow. I thought at first it was a small aircraft towing a banner as that would account for the rectangular shape but it was too blocky in appearance to be a banner unless it was either moving tangentially away from me or toward me. The color was a greyish..but it was mottled and also made me think it was a semi transparent banner from a pretty good distance. The other thing that made me discount the banner was it was moving a good bit too fast to be a banner..they simply dont move that quickly. It wasnt that fast because i could easily get the general movement of the object even though it was vague. For a moment i thought it may have been 2 aircraft in formation but discounted that as well because of the way it moved. i lost site of the object as it appeared to move away or turn with the narrow part of it toward me..i also was going under an overpass and when i came back out on the other side scanning the full horizon lost it all together. This was a very muted image at best..but was very substantial when it first appeared. the size of it when holding thumb and forefinger at arms length would be about an inch. It is altogether impossible for me to say how far it was..but the airport i related it to (Alliance) is approximately 10 miles n-w of where i-d put the image;32.8525977602111;-97.1370517786561
