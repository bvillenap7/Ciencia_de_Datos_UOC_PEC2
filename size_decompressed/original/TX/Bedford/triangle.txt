Triangle behaves as a ufo then transitions to a slow moving (like) airplane with red running lights. Object vanishes either out of sight or turns running lights off. Suspect it to be some sort of helicopter or airplane capable of hovering for extended periods of time. Not the first time seeing these anomalies in the same vicinity of the Bedford Dallas Fort Worth Texas airport area. This sort of sighting occurs every other month. Have tracked some airplanes landings, and taking off from the airport with strange light patterns, later going in the same tracks as the UFOs.;32.8525977602111;-97.1370517786561
