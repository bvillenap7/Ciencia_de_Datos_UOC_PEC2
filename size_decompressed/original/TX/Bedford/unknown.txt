Constant white/red light at high altitude seen in Texas;2019-10-08 20:42:00;2 minutes;Constant white/red light at high altitude seen in Texas At approximately 20:42 on a clear night (10/08/2019), a bright white light was seen by 2 individuals in Bedford, Texas.  It was obvious this light was not coming from an airplane, as it was constant (not flashing) and white.  Airplanes were seen in the vicinity, but were at a much lower altitude than the white light.  The white light seemed to be moving slowly across the sky, but appeared to be getting progressively smaller as if the light was increasing altitude.  The light then stops moving across the sky and changes from white to red before fading out completely.  We have never seen anything like this before and I felt compelled to report it.;32.8525977602111;-97.1370517786561
