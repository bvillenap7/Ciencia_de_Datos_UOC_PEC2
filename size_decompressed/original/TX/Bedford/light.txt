Star-like crafts seen flying at speeds faster than satellite over DFW, government associate consulted and confirmed not normal.;2012-07-06 22:00:00;3-5 hours;Star-like crafts seen flying at speeds faster than satellite over DFW, government associate consulted and confirmed not normal. Started off as one, mistook it for a shooting star that slowed down and whipped around.  No specific flight formation as it was zipping around randomly.  One by one more showed up, it almost looked as if they were playing with each other.  All 5-7 disappeared and as fast as they disappear they reappeared as one, miles to the right in the sky and fanned out.   My hands are 5-6 long, 4-5 wide, holding my arms out straight it took 5-6 hands across the sky, thats the only thing I have to compare distance.   All of them thereafter continued to play in the sky for hours.  No video evidence was take as a camera was unavailable at the time.  No colored lights were seen, they were star-like.  I would say they might have had potential to be a plain however they were moving at such a speed, no airplane in the area or at all could compare as moving miles at a time took only half a second.  No sound was emitted.  I have also seen satellites, this was not a satellite. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date of sighting were not indicated by the source of the report.
