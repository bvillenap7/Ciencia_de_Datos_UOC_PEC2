Bright glowing sphere over Shamrock, TX.;2018-01-20 08:20:00;4 minutes;Bright glowing sphere over Shamrock, TX. On 1-20-18, at 8:20 am, on I-40 east of Shamrock, Tx, I seen a glowing sphere in the sky.  The sky was visible and clear with 5 other air craft flying leaving contrails/chemTrails.  You could make out each air craft and the glowing sphere was closer to where you could see that it was not a air craft, it caught my eye while I was driving by glowing bright like a LED light.  It started going bright and dim for about 2 mins and then faded out and blended in with sky.   It reappeared 1min later, and I stopped to try to get video with my phone, but the phone could not detect the glowing sphere only the aircraft in the back round.  It continued to glow for 4-5 min then disappear.;35.2145;-100.2535
