It seemed strange because they seemed much higher than birds usually fly.  My son thought it looked more like debris blowing around at a high altitude. He then noticed another much larger object appear.  It was a reddish color, and it appeared top be hovering near the other objects. It appeared to be diamond shaped.  I ran in our shop to grab binoculars, but before I was able to get back out, my son said it was taking off.  When I got back outside, it had already disappeared to the south.  This happened in a very short period of time.  The object would have had to accelerate to extremely high speeds to be out of sight by the time I was back outside.  We had a clear view to the south.;33.5564;-96.8987
