There were two crafts moving in a very smooth, slow manner.  Seemed to be closer than an airplane would be.  I listened for a sound of an airplane or helicopter but could not hear anything.  They seemed to be so close for not making a sound.  They were moving to the east. They were moving simotaniously.  There were three very bright, clear lights in the shape of a triangle with blinking lights in between.  Both crafts looked the same.  They were very close together yet moving at the same time keeping the same distance apart from each other. Then they slowly moved out of my view.;35.5363897435897;-100.953771794872
