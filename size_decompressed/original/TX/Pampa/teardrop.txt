Teardrop craft and fast moving interception by line shaped craft followed by increased airplane activity;2020-01-06 12:00:00;8-10 minutes;Teardrop craft and fast moving interception by line shaped craft followed by increased airplane activity Witnessed while traveling south on HWY 70 near I-40 outside of Pampa, TX.  In the sky was a tear drop shaped object that appeared to be hovering or slowly traveling towards earth. I watched it for a few minutes to witness any changes or try to form a logical explanation to what it could be.  While watching the tear drop shape, a long bright light appeared. It was moving at what appeared to be “normal airplane” speed, until it suddenly increased speed and went straight through the tear drop shape.  Meanwhile, the teardrop shape was forming more of an orb shape and fading into the sky.  After speeding through the teardrop shape, the long white line slowed to a near complete stop or hover. While trying to get my camera out, the teardrop shape completely disappeared and the much larger white line remained.  I was unable to get great shots of it, because of the positioning of the sun, but I did get a photo of the white line while it was hovering.  We pulled over to watch most of this unfold and it was a crazy experience to witness to say the least. Additionally, we noticed increased airplane activity following this incident and the “chem trails” (or whatever you want to call them) behind these traditional airplanes/jets were entirely different in appearance from the teardrop & white line.;35.5363897435897;-100.953771794872
