Headed north bound on Big Spring Street.35 to 40mph. Broad daylight no clouds in sky. After the object faded away my watch read 2:10pm.Really bright silver object.Was visible for a couple of blocks then seemed to retract and fade away. As hard as I tried to make out the craft I could not but that it was extremely bright metallic and it seemed to retract into the atmosphere. I was trying to convince my self that it was a plane but in truth I could not make out that it was a plane.;31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
The object was not a plane and did not have any distinguishing features except that it was it was small gray and saucer shaped.;1998-08-13 00:00:00;1 to 5 seconds;The object was not a plane and did not have any distinguishing features except that it was it was small gray and saucer shaped. I saw this craft a few years ago while I was watering the trees outside.  I myself have always had a strong insterest in the paranormal such as ghosts and ufos.  I have even talked my friends into going ghost hunting in our area but with little or no luck.  The craft I saw was small and gray/silver far off in the distance.  I was watering the trees and plants and I just looked up at the sky(I was facing south) and there it was just a small gray object in the sky that did not fit in with my memory of any object I have ever seen before in my life.  I looked down and thought about it for a second then quickly looked back up and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
UFO over Midland, Texas.;2015-02-10 16:30:00;~5 seconds;UFO over Midland, Texas. Midland, Texas, 4:30 pm, Feb. 10, 2015. I was talking to my neighbor and his brother-in-law across the back yard fence when I spotted the UFO.  It was in the eastern sky over Midland.  I said UFO and the other two men looked to where I was pointing. One man said it isn't a plane or bird.  The other man said  They are watching us.It was visible for about 5 seconds before moving out of our sight. The craft appeared to be a fat disc similar to the one on the front page of your web site.  It was light gray or silver in color.  The craft was moving from south to north faster than a balloon could move.  I estimate it at 4,000 feet high and 3 miles away.  The size could be compared to a 737 airliner.  It moved in a strait path until it was out of our sight.;31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
