Unidentified oval shape object seen in Texas;2002-03-15 20:45:00;about 3 minutes;Unidentified oval shape object seen in Texas Clear dark sky with stars on it. No moon. Horizontal distance to object about 250-300 feet. Vertical distance from ground about 50 feet. Estimated size of object was about 15 feet (diameter). Shape was like oval but hard to detect exactly as was so bright. Object was shining brite white color light, brighter than moon normally. The light beam was seen from the object straight down toward ground. Object did not move or it moved straight away from us so that movement was not seen. Object was seen about 40 seconds from first detecting. After that light beam disappeared, the light emitted by the object started to get less bright and after about 30 seconds there was no object anymore but instead the small light emitting cloud which was spreading as a function of time and after 1 more minute was hard to see anymore. The whole process was taken to video tape by my 15 years old son. ((NUFORC Note:  We would very much like to view the alleged video footage, but the witness elects to remain anonymous, and provides no contact information.  PD));31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
