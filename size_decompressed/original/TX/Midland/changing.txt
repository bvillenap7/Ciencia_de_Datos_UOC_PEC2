I'm always star gazing but I know stars arent supposed to move. These objects keep changing shape and direction. They always seem to keep coming back every two days. I know other people in this area sees the same thing because I see camera flashes like someone else is taking pictures. I was always skeptical about this kind of thing but what Im seeing is without reason. It has bright white lights and a stream of flashing lights around it. They seem to hover around houses late at night like they are observing studying.;31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
