A 'dancing' star;1976-06-15 02:00:00;15 seconds;A 'dancing' star While sleeping in the backyard, with my brother and two visiting friends, I noticed a small bright light moving very high above.  It was a clear night and at first glance I thought it was either an airplane, or better yet, maybe a satellite passing overhead.  It was neither.  It was a tiny dot of medium brightness that moved rather quickly, in a straight line, for a seemingly short distance before coming to an abrupt halt.  It remained stationary for 1-2 seconds, then darted off in a direction close to that in which I first saw it move from.  There was no accelleration.  It went from nothing to all out speed instantly, then once aqain stopped suddenly and remained motionless for another second or two.  This display of short bursts of speed, in different directions, followed by abrupt stops continued for maybe fifteen seconds, give or take, then the little dancing dot zipped away and vanished, looking somewhat like a meteor.  While this was going on, I asked if anyone saw what I was seeing, but there was no answer.  They were sound asleep.  The next morning, I told them about what I saw... and it took me quite a while to live it down.  Should have kept my mouth shut. I have no idea of the size or shape.  It was the same color and intensity as a high flying aircraft's white tail light, or a satellite.  It blended in well with the stars and I'd have not even noticed it, at all, had I not happened to be looking up, in the right place, at just the right time.  If I were to hold a ruler out at arms length, while this object was darting around, it would have been viewed as performing all of its maneuvers within about a two inch square window before 'zipping' away and vanishing.  Not very spectacular, but noteworthy. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
It was one solid light.;2004-06-13 23:14:00;1-5 min;It was one solid light. I was at the intersection FM1787 & FM1788 when I noticed a light going from south to north not blinking a the jets do. This is what made me pull over and stop. I drive a crude oil truck. I work one week of days and one week of nights. I've done this for 20 years. When it was going across the sky it was about 4 inches below jupiter. When it reached jupiter it went straight up out of sight and i had turned all the lights off of my 18 wheeler to watch it. After it went straight up you could'nt see it no more.At first I thought it was a jet when i saw it but there was no blinking lights.;31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
Strange flashes of light near Sirius.;2006-01-23 22:35:00;3 to 5 minutes;Strange flashes of light near Sirius. At around 10:35pm I walked outside to smoke a cigarette. The night was clear with little to no wind. As I glanced up (toward the south) I noticed flashes of light near Sirius. I thought it was odd because aircraft don't fly that close together unless they are military. As I looked closer, I noticed that the flashes were not moving and not consistant like aircraft lights. Instead it was as if they were popping all around Sirius. There were very faint but observable from my vantage point even with the light pollution from the city. I am also sure I saw some sort of thin green/blue light sreak near the flashes. After 2-3 minutes of watching and not believeing what I was seeing I woke up my friend and asked them them to tell me what she saw. She said, I see little flashes of light around that star. What is that?  I swear the first thing I thought of was some kind of battle going on. Did anyone else see this?;31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
Multiple Lights In Sky  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter sighting, combined with a sighting of a satellite??  PD));2007-06-04 22:30:00;1 hour;Multiple Lights In Sky I arrived at my parents’ house at approximately 1030 PM CST (2230) to gather some things I had left there.  A friend of mine who is staying at the house was standing near our shop building, which is approximately 50 yards from the main house, looking into the sky.  When I approached him, he asked if I saw anything flying low and silent on my way there.  I had not seen anything out of the ordinary.  He described a pair of non-flashing lights, red and blue, on opposing ends of the ‘craft.’ It flew on an east-to-west bearing, and quickly altered direction to the north and dimmed to non-visible.  The total duration was 2-4 minutes and was approximately 1 mile away at its closest point to his position.  He also commented that animals in the neighborhood were acting peculiar in that the horses next door were in a state of unrest and that dogs all around the area were barking loudly, many at once.  Within 5 minutes of my arrival, two bright lights appeared in polar-opposite positions to each other, one to the northwest, and the other to the southeast.  Each one brightened and dimmed at no certain interval and independently of one another.  Each one also seemed to ‘flicker’ and several times changed from a reddish hue to a bluish or greenish tone.   Additionally, there were three short ‘flashes’ from the northernmost ‘object.’  It may be important to note that two of the 4 observers of this event confirmed that there may have been two distinct lights on the northern object, or possibly two objects.  These two ‘objects’ seemed to be on an approximate inclination (relative to our position) of 40°.  The distance from my location could not be determined therefore I cannot be certain about the approximate height of the object from the ground. The total duration of this event was around 25 minutes.  By 11:10 PM (2310 hours), neither object was visible. Notes:  Weather Conditions: Clear, full visibility.  75° F. Lighting Conditions: Dark, no city street light interference.  Location south of Midland, Texas city limits approximately 7 miles. It might be worth noting that in 3 different locations which I can pinpoint by map, local police and sheriff patrol units were sitting beside the road.  Also, after leaving the location of our sighting, my friend told me that two patrol units were driving around the area.;31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
UFO sighting yeilds uncomfortable sense that they can tell I was observing them.;2011-11-19 21:45:00;3 minutes;UFO sighting yeilds uncomfortable sense that they can tell I was observing them. While unloading groceries from my car I spent my ritualistic minute looking at the sky, as always, fascinated by space.  A movement caught my eye, a small light, about the size of a small magnitude star was moving directly overhead and appeared to be very high in altitude - I'm not sure how I know this, but, nonetheless, some instinctive detection of relative altitude let me know that it was way up there, maybe just outside of the Earth's atmosphere.   It moved from directly overhead slowly to the east, then northeast, then slowed and changed direction to south, then stopped, then moved in several different directions, seemed to be hunting something and I became very nervous, almost sensing that it could tell I was watching.   I will not go back outside to try to video it as the English video available online from yesterday is so nearly identical.;31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
Blue UFO hovers above me for several minutes;2018-07-11 22:09:00;5 minutes;Blue UFO hovers above me for several minutes On the night of July 11, 2018 I was sitting outside in my boyfriends backyard with him.  While he was smoking a cigarette at the patio table, I had my eyes wandering around the sky looking for anomalies as I was attempting to contact a UFO or get one to appear. I did this by using Dr. Steven Greer's ET Contact app.  I was playing the crop circle tones found within the app and trying to consciously contact anyone or anything that would appear. After about ten minutes, a blue UFO appeared above us in the sky and made some smooth motions to the left and to the right.  I turned off the app and opened up my camera to record the UFO.  The video attached is what I saw.  Through my eyes, the object was a blue/ white light hovering above us.  After five minutes and the video I took, the object dematerialized from above us and never returned.  We then discussed what we had seen and went back inside the house.  Short and simple: a blue UFO hovered above us and then disappeared completely.  My boyfriend and I both witnessed it and can account for all the details.;31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
