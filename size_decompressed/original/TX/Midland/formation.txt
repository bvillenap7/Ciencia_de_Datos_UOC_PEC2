Sighting of a formation of cigar shaped U.F.O.s;2002-06-12 20:30:00;8 minutes;Sighting of a formation of cigar shaped U.F.O.s Well, it happened at dusk when the stars were just coming out, myself and a friend were driving along the street on our way to eat with some friends at a nice pizzeria when my friend, who was driving the vehicle, brought the objects to my attention.  There were three of them, motionless in the sky, just visible over the buildings. They appeared to be very far away and gave the impression of being VERY large though I can't be certain of this. Each one appeared to be of the cigar shaped variety and glowed a dull white which stood out well against the darkening sky.  They were in a perfect triangular formation and never moved at all.  The sighting ended when we arrived at our destination and the building obscured our view, when we left later it was gone. Now I have always been a believer in the U.F.O. phenomenon though I have never been convinced that extraterrestrials were to blame.  My friend on the other hand has never been what I would call a believer which makes it all the more interesting that she saw it first.  Now I don't know what it was, and couldnâ€™t hazard a guess, but I can tell you this it was nothing I or my friend has ever seen before or expect to see ever again.
