Large cigar shaped hovering craft with flashing lights.;1978-01-20 02:00:00;30 seconds;Large cigar shaped hovering craft with flashing lights. I have always wanted to report this but never knew who to tell unti last night.  I think something very interesting about my encounter is that it happened again in 1989.  The first encounter happened when I was 8 years old with my friend ((name deleted)) also 8. We were camping out in his front yard. He and his family lived out in the country. We were about to go to sleep in his Pop up trailer and all of a sudden there was a very deep thrust noise and the trailer began to vibrate.  We ran outside to see what was happening and looked up and saw a very large cigar shaped object hovering above us. Lights underneath the craft of different colors seemed to flash from left to right one after the other across the bottom of the craft. We ran inside to get binoculars and accidentally wake up his father who than came out with us. We were outside again within seconds and the craft was gone.  We did think we could barely see it hovering on the horizon for some time but it was too far away to see anything. Chad and I were avid model airplane builders and were very familiar with military aircraft. We knew what we saw was not a blimp because there was no way it could have hovered over us and then been miles off the horizon within seconds.  My second encounter happened in 1989. Also in Midland, at my child hood home. At approximately 2am again I had pulled into my driveway after leaving my girlfriends home. I decided to listen to a song before I went inside. As I was sitting in my car my car began to vibrate and I heard a very low base noise.  Suprised, I made sure my woofers were turned off in my car and turned down my stereo. I noticed lights reflecting off my sisters car and immediately looked around for other cars and there were none in sight. Then I noticed the lights were reflecting off the top of her car. I got out, looked up and saw once again a large cigar shaped object with lights flashing left to right across the bottom of the craft.  Both times it seemed to to be about 100 yards long and about 100 ft. in the air. Once again I ran inside to get binoculars and ran back outside (waking my mother accidentally). once again it was gone. As I scanned the horizon I could see it. This time I was 19 and had a car so I got into my car to chase it. I never could get any closer to it. It seemed to just stay out of my visual reference, no matter how far I drove. So I turned around and went home.  Thank you for your time, please call with any questions or collaborating evidence.  John DeFrance;31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
cigar shape rotation of brights length of 2 buses;2008-04-19 22:49:00;25-30 seconds;cigar shape rotation of brights length of 2 buses To whom it may concern on April the 19th I pulled into my driveway and turned off my PT Crusier, and was talking to Cindy on my cell phone. Since around 10:00 p.m.. I mentioned something about the moon when all of the sudden. My car lit up, with all these bright colors everywhere, red, yellow, and pale yellow. And I told my friend oh my God Cindy you ought see  this! ! I jumped out of the car I could hear Cindy shouting Susan Susan and the bell of the door going ding ding. Then what I saw was AWESOME!!!!!!!! There was a humming sound and the colors where everywhere. The lights were the length of two buses side by side above my trees. And the lights were in rotation. In between the lights I felt like I was being watched. I held my cell phone in my left hand and in my right hand I raised up the symbol of hook em horns, and I smiled. Then they took off to the west. This lasted 25 to 30 seconds. To me I'll always cherish this for the rest of my life. On 4/20/08 I contacted Midland International Airport at 10:45 a.m. spoke with Clay airport opperations. Who wouldn't let me inquire about the sighting on the 19th. And thats when I couldn't talk to the tower. He gave me Petersphone number.;31.9925992094862;-102.107653359684
