A working legal mexican and I, a woman were stargazing. The man pointed ou Three stars which were in a row.  As we both looked at them, one of the stars began moving slowly as a plane would appear only it was still then began moving.  I began looking more intently. It faded out then disappeared. I noticed another star at a stand still then began moving.  IT LOOKED exactly like a star. It traveled a great distance. Across the whoke sky. Fast.  But not fast as a shooting star.  More like a plane. When we discussed that we had both seen two stars move stars we opted to go in the house. After reading some of my book, I closed my eyes. My light bulb exploded in the glass light fixture. I don't have photos but have seen several ufos in the kast few weeks and will send one picture if I am able to get one.;33.5009;-97.2299
