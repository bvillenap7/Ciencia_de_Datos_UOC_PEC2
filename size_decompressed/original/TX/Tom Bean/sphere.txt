Pulsing orbs.;2020-08-31 02:00:00;35 minutes;Pulsing orbs. Over the dense country area above the two towns of Tom bean and Van Alstyne, Texas  I observed three separate orbs clustering in one spot in the sky then departing in similar patterns until they disappeared.  One was a red orb mimicking a tower beacon light, started changing colors and portraying patterns in its strobe like fashion flashing then to solid red again as it left the area of the tower, the second orb stayed bright white with little strobing events and scouted in another direction from the red tower light.  And the third orb was slowly pulsing drifting slowly across the night sky and began to get lower and closer to the car,. As I was driving towards it I flashed my lights on and off at the orb. It seemed to drive towards me and when I turned my lights off the orb disappeared.  This orb stayed a bright white light and floated close to the light tower, as if each orb was mimicking the lights it saw around them and then changing as they flew away.;33.5167;-96.4843
