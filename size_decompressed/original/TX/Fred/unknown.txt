Bright orange/red glow in the sky;2011-01-06 20:30:00;about 2 min;Bright orange/red glow in the sky We were sitting outside on our back porch watching the neighbors shoot fireworks.  After they were through, we continued sitting outside and there was this huge bright orange/reddish glow gliding across the northern sky moving from west to east.  We thought it looked like an airplane on fire, but there was no noise.  It continued until it went dim and disappeared.  Then about 15 minutes later we saw the same thing again.  I called the Tyler county sheriffs office to see if anyone else had reported it, but no one had.  I understand they had a report last week of the same thing.;30.5676;-94.1754
