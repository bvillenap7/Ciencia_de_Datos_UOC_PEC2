Triangle craft low & slow San Antonio, Texas;2012-06-01 00:00:00;10 minutes;Triangle craft low & slow San Antonio, Texas Sitting in my backyard having a drink looked out to my right (north east) and looked at the stars. Noticed three stars in a row with a fourth star perpendicular to the three in a row.  The star looking lights were moving towards me, (heading west towards San Antonio, TX, pretty much right down I-35 south bound. As I stared I couldn’t believe what I was seeing so I ran inside and grabbed my roommate who was cooking in our kitchen. I ran him outside and pointed and said “What is that?!” He squinted for a few seconds and confused under his breath said, “that’s..that’s a UFO”. The object continued towards us, over our heads and then towards the city lights on the horizon of San Antonio. There are two Air Force bases in San Antonio, one of which was near by our house we rented, but the craft was silent, moving way too slow to be an airplane and when it got close enough it just looked like a triangle that was pure black. I couldn’t tell the difference between the ni! ght sky and the craft besides the outline of the shape of a triangle and the 4 white lights that remained on and never dimmed, blinked or showed any kind of signal. For size comparison I would say if I held up a basketball right over my head it was the size of the ball but flying low, maybe 3,000-5,000 feet at best guess. My roommate will still claim he could hear a faint hum from the craft but it didn’t sound like a propeller from a drone or plane or a jet engine...it was a quiet wave like sounding hum. The craft disappeared into the limelight of the city and I never saw it again.;29.5738;-98.2291999999999
