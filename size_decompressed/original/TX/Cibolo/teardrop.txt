At precisely 4:45 am on 01-09-03,I observed a gold glowing object in the north eastern sky which appeared to be several miles away but nestled in the light layer of moon lite sky. The object was vividly clear and stationary for 2-3 minutes , then moved back away further north in the clouds and the light vanished, It then began to glow brighter, and seemed to come back towards me out of the cloud and then stayed in the original position for 2 minutes again. The object repeated this process 3 times and also I observed a plane flying under and away from it appearing to be many miles from it but the plane lights blinking made the hugh and clear glow of the UFO un-mistakable as the object was seemingly 10 times the size of the plane blinking in the distant horizon.;29.5738;-98.2291999999999
