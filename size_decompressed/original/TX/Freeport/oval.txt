UFO glowing with heat dispersing from object. No sound. I was awaken by an intense white beam. On 8/24/07 at approximately 03:15 a.m. Freeport, Texas, Surfside Beach:  I was, alone in my car and awaken by a bright white beam in the left and right eye’s.  For 20 minutes I could not find what or who had awaken me.  I lay back in the seat my eyes were still open because I was feeling a bit terrified and disorientated. As I looked out the back passenger side window of my car, I noticed an oval object dark from the interior but bright white from the exterior that seemed to be hovering 100 ft. to my left side.  The silent object was exhausting a smothering heat directly over me. At this point, I tried to start my car and the engine failed to turn over.  Anxiously I glanced back up and the object was slowly moving in a northern direction.  After which, I was able to successfully start my vehicle and drove off the beach. Upon leaving the beach my right eye was blurry and both temples were sore.  It has been 2 days now and both my temples still feel sore.;29.0197571428571;-95.3345142857143

It was descending, and then it elevated within a blink an eye, afterwards it accelerated at high speed towards my local chemical plants.  There were clouds it flew into, and then it disappeared. The craft looked similar to a helicopter except it didn’t have a propeller or tail.  It was oval shaped with a red light under it.  It was about 12- 15 feet in length.;29.0197571428571;-95.3345142857143
