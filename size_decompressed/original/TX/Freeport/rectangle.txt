They were very very bright both leaving behind a green trail.  Not long after the sun started to rise and we noticed a very bright light in the sky.  It moved in very fast motions.   It looked like it would go miles the the left or right or up and down within seconds.   When zoomed in on with camera it looked like a rectangle standing vertical and it was continuously turning.   With every side that appeared to us it was a different color blue, red, green, etc.  Throughout watching it, it seemed like there was a colored glow around it and at one point there was like this burst of white dots that shot out from the right side of it in an open cone shape.  I got pictures of it but it turned out like a line with bulbous sections, so I'm not sure if it was moving or if it was due to me moving.;29.0197571428571;-95.3345142857143
