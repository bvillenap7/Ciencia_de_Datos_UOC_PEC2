Through binoculars my husband and I saw a sphere in southern sky from our beach house on San Luis Pass.  It was blinking red, green and amber lights.  The green and red looked to be revolving around the top and bottom of the sheer.  This object was very far away and seemed to be out over the Gulf of Mexico about 25 or 30 degrees above the horizon.  It remained in the same spot in the sky for several hours.  Finally it was so late that we went inside.  We often look at stars from our deck, but have never seen anything nor reported anything like this before.;29.0197571428571;-95.3345142857143
