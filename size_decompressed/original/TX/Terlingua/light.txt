Flickering red and white light with floating and very rapid straight line movements then stationary spotted near Big Bend Nat'l Park;2008-11-27 03:00:00;>20mins;Flickering red and white light with floating and very rapid straight line movements then stationary spotted near Big Bend Nat'l Park My friend and I (both degreed professionals) were in the desert approx. 15 to 20 miles northwest of Big Bend Natâ€™l Park 3am Nov. 27.  We saw a light larger than a star near the horizon that looked like it could have been over the Chisos Basin or a little south. The light flashed and flickered red and white and made movements floating like a butterfly or a leaf in the wind interspersed with very rapid movement in a straight line.  Sometimes straight up or at and angle-each time stopping instantly and them floating this went on for 20 minutes at least.;29.3165;-103.5597
