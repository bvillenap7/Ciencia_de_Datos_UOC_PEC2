Silent double pyramid with bright lights.;2014-08-26 03:35:00;5 minutes;Silent double pyramid with bright lights I walked out onto my deck, looked to the Northwest sky over Pace Bend on Lake Travis and saw what appeared to be one craft, shaped like a pyramid on top and an inverted pyramid.  It made no sound as it hovered in place.   The lights were bright blue, in several places on the formation, mixed with white lights that blinked.   It very slowly began to move in my direction, so I went inside, as I became frightened.    My home is on an airline flight path, but this was not a plane.  It made no sounds, and had too many lights to be a plane.   It is also not typical that we have planes flying over at this time of night.;30.449;-97.9669
