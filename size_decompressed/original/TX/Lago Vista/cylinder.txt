We were out on our back deck to view super moon.  We live high on a hill and have a panoramic view.  We saw an extremely bright, white light coming toward us, moving east to west.  We thought it was a helicopter, but commented it was moving too fast.   Quickly, we saw a second bright light behind the first light.   When it passed by the tree tops near our deck, we saw an entire structure.  It was a long cylinder, as long as a large jet.  It was silver in color and we could see no windows.   The bright lights were on both ends of structure.   As my husband put his binoculars up for a better look, it turned up and moved north-west and disappeared.   For a structure as large as what we saw, to move upward that quickly, seemed impossible.;30.449;-97.9669
