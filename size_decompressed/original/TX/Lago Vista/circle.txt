IT LOOKED LIKE A STAR BUT WAS A DIFFERENT COLOR.  ORIGINALLY, IT WAS A DEEP YELLOW AND THEN BECAME A BIT MORE ORANGE OVER TIME. THE OBJECT APPEARED ROUND IN SHAPE AND WAS PRIMARILY MOTIONLESS FOR OVER AN HOUR, ALTHOUGH IT DID SEEM TO BOUNCE SLIGHTLY AT TIMES.  THEN, IT BEGAN MOVING NORTH ACROSS THE SKY, WELL ABOVE THE HORIZON. IT STOPPED A FEW TIMES, MOVED UP AND DOWN IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER, THEN CONTINUED NORTHWARD. I’VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.  IT DID NOT MOVE AS FAST AS A SHOOTING STAR, OR IN THE SAME MANNER OR DIRECTION THAT A PLANE WOULD. ONCE THE OBJECT STARTED TO MOVE, I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES UNTIL I COULDN’T SEE IT ANYMORE.
