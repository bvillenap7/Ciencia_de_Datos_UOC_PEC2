I was driving when I noticed a beam of light in the clouds in front of me, as I got closer it got lower to the ground until I drove right underneath it at which point it was approximately 200-300 yards off the ground. 30 minutes later I drove back back the location of the sighting to find nothing. It hovered in the air with complete silence;30.449;-97.9669
