Triangular craft moving very slowly, approx .350 ft above me. no discernable sound,bright colored lights.;2007-10-24 05:35:00;6 seconds;Triangular craft moving very slowly, approx. 350 ft above me. no discernable sound,bright colored lights. craft had appeared in front of my neighbors house two mornings before. He said it was making manuvers back and forth across the trees with extremely bright lights on shining down, but no noise that he could hear.I told him to call me if it came back. I'm usually up at five getting ready for work.  He called me and said,it's back.  I told him I'm on my way with my camera.It took me about 2-3 min. to get ready and called him back to see if it was still there he said it is heading up the creek toward my house.  I said, I don't see anything i'm on my way and hung up.I was standing next to my car about to open the door and then I saw it.There were no lights on at my home, and I, and my neighbor live in a remote area of East Texas.His house is about 1/2 mile down the creek from me.At first I dismissed it because I thought it was an airplane way up high,but I continued to look at it.My Wife was watching me leave and saw it too, at different angle from our bedroom.There is a private airstrip close to our house about (2 miles)and we see all kinds of small planes all the time, usually during the day ,but somtimes at night.One thing they all have in common is the way their running lights are configured.What caught my attention was the brightness of the lights on what I thought were wings and the two oversize lights on the front lower part of the fusalodge that were very dim.When it got closer I realized it was not several thousand feet up but a small craft only about 350 ft up.I estimate it was traveling about 45-60 mph.  IT had no wings to speak of,and only made a hum .When it passed overhead I heard a wisp ,like when birds fly by close enough you can hear them.It was only after it passed directly over me that i could hear the hum,like the sound a golfcart makes when it's moving slow.Dimentionaly it was about 25 feet long and 25-30 feet wide.Very dark flat color, no reflection .The part normally thought of as the cockpit was the only rounded part of it,but the nose was very blunt or flat and wide.There was no tail.... no rear lights at all. From the way it looked and the amount of noise it made I don't see how it could fly that slow.;30.4942;-94.9901
2nd appearance ofTriangular craft moving very slowly, approx .350 ft up .will have camera ready -now on.;2008-01-15 05:29:00;20 sec.;2nd appearance ofTriangular craft moving very slowly, approx .350 ft up .will have camera ready -now on. 5:29 am , I was getting ready for work and my wife came running in the kitchen yelling it's back again she said right after I left the bedroom that whole end of the house lit up outside.  She it's going the same way it went last time so we looked out the kitchen window and were joined by my 17 year old son. There it was traveling above the creek in front of the house ,same shape as last time,triangular but rounded in the front.This time all the lights were pinkish white 1 on each corner and 1 0r 2 in the middle.It was at about the same elevation 300 to 400 ft. traveling at about 40-55 mph. We tried for a picture by by the time we got the camera on it was to far. It hovered for about 5 seconds over our neigbors field then shot straightaway so fast it was almost out of sight in as long as it takes to blink.;30.4942;-94.9901
triangle object with bright lights;2009-04-13 22:50:00;1.00 minute;triangle object with bright lights To whom it may concern,  On Monday, 04-13-2009, I was exiting my car to open the gate to my residence.  I looked up in the night sky and saw three bright white lights in a triangle formation. I stepped away from my gate, approx. 30ft, to get a better look at the object.  I could not see any clear edges of the object. The lights did not change shape or appear to shine a beam. I could not guess the height of the object from the ground but it was not at tree level. The object did not appear to emitt any sound and was traveling from a southerly to northerly direction.  The night was clear with high visibility. I only observed the object for approx. 1 minute. I am accustomed to seeing aircraft from the George Bush International airport and do see high flying aircraft.  I am just trying to get clarification of what I saw in the sky.  If I knew for certain this was an aircraft I would not be reporting this information. The time this event happened was between 22:50 and 23:00hrs.;30.4942;-94.9901
