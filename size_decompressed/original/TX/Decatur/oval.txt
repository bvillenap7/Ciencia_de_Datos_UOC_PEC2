July 25,2019 Between 17:30 Southeast of Decatur, Texas my husband and I were traveling west on highway US 380 from Denton to Decatur.  I noticed one oval disc looking object hovering in the Southwestern sky.  It was a clear day except for some large Altocumulus clouds floating in the sky.  I observed it as it went into a cloud and never reappeared.;33.2351;-97.5739999999998
