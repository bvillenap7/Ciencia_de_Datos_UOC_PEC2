Northwest of Decatur, Texas:  Between 19:30 and 20:00, I was outside watering my plants and trees.  It was a clear night and I observed two objects fairly close in the Western Sky.  They were hovering on top of the other one and seem to stay in the same position for a few minutes.  I continued to watch them and they took off into the southeastern sky at a great rate of speed.  They circled around and came back past my location at a greater rate of speed and disappeared in the north sky.  They both appeared to have several lights in front of the crafts.;33.2351;-97.5739999999998
