A friend of mine decided to spend the night at short notice. We were working on a project, when the wind began to blow very hard. Though the news had just said there was a chance of a storm, I went outside to look around. 2 disk like objects hovered in the air (they were far off, but bigger than the stars), soon another joined, but didn't move slowly. It was more of a jerk left, right, up, down. They followed each other for a while, and my friend and I watched. We weren't sure what to think, seeing as neither of us believe in aliens and whatnot. The lighted disks flew away in a triangular formation... leaving us stunned.;33.2351;-97.5739999999998
