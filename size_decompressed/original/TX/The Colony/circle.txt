Blue and green circular light seen above texas ice storm.;2013-12-06 20:00:00;1 minute;Blue and green circular light seen above texas ice storm During a trail hike at Arbor Hills Nature Preserve during some of the peak hours of the big ice storm that hit the US this passed weekend,  Me, my girlfriend, and a friend witnessed a larger circular light appear in the clouds about a mile East of us.  The size of the circle must have been near a quarter mile, it lit up the entire sky.  The light first flashed blue then green then cut off like someone turned off a light switch.  The light was clearly coming from above/behind the storm clouds.  We continued to walk in shock and saw the light once again a few miles further East about 30minutes later.  Absolutely no other visible objects in the sky.;33.0951000000002;-96.8804999999996

I have a old phone crappy camera but I finally got the unknown craft that I've seen come to my property and watches hovering over my house , . Somedays it comes lighting speed hovers right above me.  It's almost like I know they gonna come be present.  One of the times hovers just right above my roof, I got my dad to come see and instantly it shoots straight up in the sky no lights no sound and I see it there hiding in a cloud ( I have binoculars). My dad goes back inside. And within one second it shoots straight back at and it dims 3 solid no blinking red lights . But it hovers over me and it hits me with 1 extremely bright flash . Almost like it just took a picture of me. And its close above a one story house .one time I caught literally hiding on the very top of my tree in my backyard flashes  at me like 4 times and totally invisible I see it on the opposite direction way far away not even in lik! e a second . But last night it came over to me same craft it came n go couple of times till I saw up to 4 or 5 type of jet planes all over the sky I have never seen so many planes come out of know where and it shoots out out of my sight within seconds. And of course hovers literally right over me maybe lil over 20 feet up and shoots me with a bright flash .blinding then it leaves when planes arrive I dont even know from where they came so fast.;33.0951000000002;-96.8804999999996
