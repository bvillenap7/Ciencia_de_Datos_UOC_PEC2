The flash was diffuse but fairly bright in a cone shape -- lasted about a second or two -- the bottom covering about 50 feet or more. I quickly looked up directly above the flash and spotted a round light floating slowly toward the east at about 100-200 feet. I ran and got my binoculars and watched as it slowly continued moving to the east. This was a single steady white light with a greenish tinge which appeared to be somewhat dimmed by the thin clouds (created by multiple persistent contrails during the day). Within a few seconds it disappeared into heavy cloud bank. I have been watching aircraft in this area for over a year and am as sure as can be this was not an aircraft. On another night, I saw two flashes several seconds apart coming at an angle onto the nearby Lewisville Lake toward a yacht which was flashing its light also -- but did not see a source at that time. Are this surveillance spheres? -- Are these signals (short flashes)? -- Are they taking some kind of photos? What could be the purposes of brief pulses of light? Perhaps there is more than light involved?;33.0951000000002;-96.8804999999996
