Winter of 05, Dallas Texas. Light Pair exhibiting impossible aerial behaviour, & not fitting air traffic profile.;2005-11-15 02:00:00;5-10 minutes.;Winter of 05, Dallas Texas. Light Pair exhibiting impossible aerial behaviour, & not fitting air traffic profile. This occurence was several months ago, but only recently did I become aware of a place where it could be 'reported'.  The UFO's came to my attention as I stepped outside my front door for some fresh air, out on the eastern sky I noticed two single orange lights, and my first thought was plane. DFW airport isn't more than a half hour away so air traffic passes through quite frequently, but as I examined the two lights their behaviour and the lights themselves on each of the sources became odd to me. I quickly dismissed the profile of plane as for many reasons. The objects lacked the blinking red tail or wing lights, their behaviour as well seemed more like a helicoptor as they kept no straight path and would change direction quite erraticly. My mind finally assumed them to be UFO's as their speed was somewhat impossible for a helicoptor to match, they weren't jets by any means but how quickly and easily they flew through the air and changed direction almost on the fly kept me questioning. It was impossible for them to be planes, and if they were helicoptors then the only way the dominant lights could move so fast was if they were infact closer to me than I'd assumed. Of course had they been closer I would of been able to hear the engines. The perceived altitude, the fact that only one light could be determined, the behaviour, they just couldn't be defined as anything man made that I had knowledge of. Wishful thinking has me hoping that they're the latest technology we're not being told about. Like the Blackbird and the wave of stealth fighter development that had people pondering years ago. For anywhere from five to ten minutes I stood on my porch scratching my head as I watched these two lights. They appeared to be a pair, as well, as they stayed within close proximity to each other, they kept their maneuvers in a small patch of sky for most of the time that I witnessed them. As I was about to head inside to get a second opinion on what I was looking at, the two lights parted ways as one went farther out of sight and dropped below the horizon, and the other shot at a remarkable speed off to the north and out of sight.  For a person who lives near an airport, and sees planes and helicoptors on a daily basis, I found for the first time something in the air that had me vexed. So I suppose this makes them UFO's, aliens I doubt however. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.0951000000002;-96.8804999999996
High altitude fast bright light;2010-10-14 06:04:00;3 seconds;High altitude fast bright light At about 6:04 AM, I was leaving for work when a bright white pinpoint of light not quite overhead caught my attention. It was traveling very fast and seemed to be at a very high altitude.  It was traveling in a generally north to south direction. It covered an approximately 30 degree arc in about three seconds. At first, I thought it must be a satellite but then it slightly altered its flight path twice from left to right in a kind of jerky motion. After that I lost sight of it as the tree in my front yard blocked the view. The light  was much brighter than the background stars.  The weather was absolutely clear.  When I arrived at work, I mentioned to my boss that I’d seen this strange light.  He said that when he had left his home in Ana, Texas, he had seen the same light and though he had seen it when it was closer to the southern horizon. He said because it was so fast and so bright he thought it was “a falling star.”  But he said he had not seen it pass overhead.;33.0951000000002;-96.8804999999996
