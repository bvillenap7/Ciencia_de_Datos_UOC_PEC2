Extraordinary Event! Neighborhood witnesses oval light with large luminous contrail pass over houses 400 yds away at 150 ft!;1999-07-27 22:00:00;30 seconds;Extraordinary Event! Neighborhood witnesses oval light with large luminous contrail pass over houses 400 yds away at 150 ft! At about 9pm myself and a friend went outside on the lawn to watch the beautiful full moon and stars. At about 9:20 pm, I spotted in my binoculars a fast moving oval shaped gold tinged light moving from northwest to the southeast. Simultaneously, my friend saw another light passing directly overhead heading north. We then saw another one at 9:35 pm passing overhead from south to north. This one drifted slowly overhead in a wavy snake-like pattern at about 20,000 feet. As an airliner approached its path -- as it moved toward the southwest, the light suddenly darted over to it and remained over it for a few seconds then hovered a couple of seconds and returned to its original path. It began zigzagging widely until it disappeared. I saw another light a little before 10:00 pm moving to the southeast. All appeared to be travelling at the same altitude. Then at about 10 pm, my friend said, Look at that! and pointed to the south of the house which overlooks the lake. Coming across the sky at about 150 feet up and 400 yards away was an oval shaped brightly lit object with a gold tinge spewing out a luminous contrail (which became approximately 50 feet in width). This object was seen by multiple witnesses -- neighbors were shouting out -- Would you look at that! and That's not ours! to the northeast and southwest of us. The object and its illuminated contrail (which looked exactly like the persistent contrails laid in the skies during the day) were distinctly horizontal moving from west to east at about 180 mph for 1.5 miles. The object looked about 20 feet across and flew steadily over the rooftops until it disappeared -- went out 30 seconds later over the city. The craft seemed to be fully lit from the inside -- or glowing smooth in appearance-- and the contrail reflected the moon on top but was self-illuminated with a slight gold and orange tinge. It stayed luminous and dissipated 30 seconds after the craft disappeared.We were in total wonderment...So close and not a sound! Was it ours? Why over a town? Why so many? What was in the contrail?  Incredible but real!!  I reported to your center on 1/10/98 a light zigzagging horizontally across the western sky with a large contrail -- perhaps this is a similar occurrence close up! I have had multiple sightings of black helicopters flying a similar path near the house since that report...;33.0951000000002;-96.8804999999996
Half-white, half-black/grey, rumbling sound and not that big.;2019-07-10 00:13:00;00:05;Half white, half black/grey, rumbling sound and not that big I heard rumbling sounds and felt it like faint bass from a car, then it became in short repeatings about 10 times.   I looked outside to see if it was a car, but there was a white half oval with almost black/grey on the other half.  It floated in the air at about a height of a cell tower for about 3 minutes, looking about the size of a little bird heli, then accelerating going over houses to not be seen.;33.0951000000002;-96.8804999999996
