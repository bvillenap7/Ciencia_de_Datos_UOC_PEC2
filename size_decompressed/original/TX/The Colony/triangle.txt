Streaking light seen overhead. Went from a standstill(hover?) position and then streaked off in a flash.;1999-10-16 22:00:00;15 seconds;Streaking light seen overhead. Went from a standstill(hover?) position and then streaked off in a flash. On the evening of the 16th of October I went outside to feed the dog in the backyard. It was a clear night and visibility was very good. I just happened to look up and as I did noticed a movement that quickly became a flash of whitish light. This light was almost directly over our neighborhood and house! Since I am not a trained spotter I cannot accurately judge the altitude and speed of the object but it seemed to be at least a hundred feet in the air in a hover position(?). As I looked up it flashed and streaked off into the night with a triangular shape at the head of AN ELONGATING TRAIL OF LIGHT! The best comparison I could make is when Voyager goes to warp on Star Trek. Yeah, I know it's strange and my wife looks at me funny but it seems this area is becoming a hotbed for sightings. Many odd things to see around here if you watch. I firmly believe that what I saw was a man-made(?) object with propulsion. I have seen many meteor showers and the little green lights they bring. Definitely not the same type of thing. Also, no sound whatsoever.;33.0951000000002;-96.8804999999996
Triangle shape ufos in the sky every night. Rotation pyramid cloak;2020-02-27 04:00:00;This past couple of month;Triangle shape ufos in the sky every night. Rotation pyramid cloak Every night I go to my backyard smoke my cigarettes with my binoculars for a few hrs at night.  And I finally starting catching multiple almost like cloak shaped triangle one bright red light at the peak and two white lights following the other points .  Be moving very slowly.  Tonight finally clear night sky no clouds.  And I got a good look at the 2 ufos triangle cloak only with 3 Lights and it seems to be rotation formation like a 3D pyramid rotating while both crafts are moving away from one another.  But what I cant stoo thinking about how it was spinning freaking cloak pyramid just above my neighbors tree line .  I was completely mesmerized by the rotating of the craft.  Just had my eyes glued to my scopes and watched it almost like a glossy style like one of those colored prisms.  Every night they are out there just hovering around the town.  Wonder if they notice me noticing them for months .;33.0951000000002;-96.8804999999996
