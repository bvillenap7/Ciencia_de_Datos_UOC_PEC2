During the afternoon, I noticed a contrail being laid to the northeast of The Colony, Texas (near Lake Lewisville north of Dallas). The skies were clear except for the wispy clouds under the contrail. At 17:35, I was scanning the skies for more contrails and pointed my binoculars almost straight up towards the east -- directly over The Colony. I could not believe what I was seeing! There were 15-20 silver spheres spread out across the sky reflecting the sun to my back! The spheres would disappear and reappear moving slowly into different patterns. I would guess these were at least at an altitude of 20-30,000 feet but that is very hard to tell. I could not make them out without binoculars. These soon disappeared and I noticed a larger white craft hovering overhead a little to my east. I focused my binoculars and watched this object for quite a while overhead then continued watching it as it slowly moved toward the area of the contrail to the northeast. It was white, reflecting the sun and appeared to have a red glow emanating from behind it at times. It then hovered again near a wisp of contrail cloud and soon after was joined one at a time by 5 spheres. These spheres (maybe 1/8 the size of the craft) slowly moved around the craft -- with very smooth and graceful moves -- as the craft moved toward the northwest. At this point they were about 6-8 miles away I would estimate and traveling slowly at about 20,000 feet. Suddenly more objects appeared around the larger craft a few at a time until there were at least 9-15 in various formations above it and to its sides. They all went out of view or disappeared at 18:35. Within 5 minutes, two large military helicopters flew overhead flying from the northeast-- the general direction of the objects. I have seen objects before around here hovering over the lake or apparently observing or interacting with contrails -- but these were no more than 2 at a time! I have never seen anything like this before!! If anyone else saw these, please write up a report! This is tr! uly a momentous discovery...that so many of these things are above us. Look up with binoculars during the day and at night to see these high altitude objects. This has been a truly mind-shifting experience!;33.0951000000002;-96.8804999999996
