Reddish glow over Buffalo, TX;2012-02-16 21:15:00;1 min;Reddish glow over Buffalo, TX I was outside walking my dogs and looked up into the sky to the north of Centerville, TX, and saw a bright redish orange glow that was big and bright at first and dimmed out like a massive fire in the sky that just withered out.   It was very high in the sky and isolated!  Kind of like an aurora borealis glow! ((NUFORC Note:  Possible display of the aurora borealis??  PD));31.411;-95.9872
