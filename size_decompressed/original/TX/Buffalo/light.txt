Changing Light near Buffalo, Texas;2010-03-05 20:37:00;10 seconds;Changing Light near Buffalo, Texas At 2037 (looked at clock right afterward)  tonight traveling south on I45 in Texas near Mile Marker 166 my friend and I witnessed a bright white light that turned red then green and faded out.  It came down at about a 45 degree angle and turned horizontal before winking out.  The light was also heading in the southern direction parell to the interstate.  It was approx 150â€™ feet of the ground when it disappeared.  I could not tell its shape that it happened very quickly.  We saw it for only about ten seconds.  I remarked to my friend that he just saw his first ufo.   I have personally seen several ufos that I have reported- I am a Professional Truck Driver.  My friend is a Professional Oil Field Equipment Salesman.;31.411;-95.9872
