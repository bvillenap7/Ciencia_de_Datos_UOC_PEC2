While driving to work on the south beltway, my son and I observed a flashing strob of intense brightnes..it was still dark at the time so we were able to see the light very well… The strobe was flashing at 10  to 20 times the rate of normal strobe lights observed on aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting..no other lights of any color were observed with the craft (Blue or Green)..The light was first observed to our left which would have been ahead of us and to the south approx. 1 miles from our location and traveling to the north then west toward the Katy, Texas, areas.. We were able to observe the strobing light far beyond the distances other strobs on aircraft in the .. Note:  As the strobbing light passed over the belt way ahead of us (approx. 1 mile) and crossed a residential area we observed on two occassions bright eruptions of a green glowing haze of light emanating from the ground below the craft.. The light was like the light electrical transfors give off when they explode… My son and I are both prior military and trained observers..;29.5768516129032;-95.5350451612908
