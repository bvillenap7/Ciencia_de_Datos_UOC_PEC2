UFO shot down over TX and NM border area.;2014-08-21 20:15:00;1 hour;UFO shot down over TX and NM border area We noticed 2 distinctive vapor like trails that were traveling in a large circular pattern over a large area in the western sky.   The two eventually converged and a large smoke plume of a dark nature appeared. the larger object seem to catch fire and proceed directly towards earth as the smaller one sped up faster than any aircraft i know of and vanished.  All was caught on camera and shows great detail.;33.7186;-102.7617
