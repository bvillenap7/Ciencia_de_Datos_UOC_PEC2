I was loading my truck, when i happened to look to the west and saw a very large and bright green fire ball streaking across the sky from east to west. When I saw the fireball, I first thought it was a meteor or something like that.  But after hearing you and Art Bell talk about all the others who had seen it as well I figured you might want to know about my sighting as well.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
I saw a fireball fall from the sky.;1998-09-23 21:45:00;2-3 sec.;I saw a fireball fall from the sky. I saw a white fire ball come out of the sky at about an 80 degree angle. The fire ball was about as big as your finger nail with arm extended. This white ball had a tail following it. In the middle of the white ball was blue. Like the color of natural gas burning on your stove. I looked like a shooting star, but was too close to the earth and too big. I live in the northwest part of Houston. I was sitting in my garage, looking south- southwest when I saw it. I didn't see where it came from, it appeared and fell to the earth very fast. It dissapeared behind the house across the street. I've never seen something like that before. I thought it was a plane crash. Nothing on the news untill I heard your director on Art Bell's radio show last night.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
A small, single fireball in the sky at an indeterminate altitude.;1998-10-15 06:35:00;4 seconds;A small, single fireball in the sky at an indeterminate altitude. I was waiting for a bus when I heard what seemed to be some sort of combustion in the sky. I looked to see what appeared to be a small, white fireball streaking a bit in the sky. It burned out within 3 or 4 seconds. I looked closely to determine any residual smoke, I saw none. I scanned the area at hand, a suburban street, for nearby power lines and found none. The fireball was an isolated incident in the sky, accompanied by no other perceptable phenomenea. The duration of the event and the nature of the fireball made it difficult to perceive an altitude.

Two huge bright fire like lights in the sky just sitting in one place and stayed there for at least 20 min.....  I beleive in the supernatural, but this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this at least for real...  I began yelling at my roomate and my girlfriend that on the ground to tell them what i saw... I jumped off the roof to get my girlfriend to come up on the roof to see what I just experienced...  It was gone....  and unfortunatly I was just laughed at............  I have never spoken of this experience again only because of the criticism my own friends....

Orange fireball w/green glow & trail low in sky no noise;2003-07-28 21:00:00;5 seconds;Orange fireball w/green glow & trail low in sky no noise I was visiting my father's home in the Heights in Houston, TX and was outside walking my dog around 9pm (7/29).  I saw a rather large bright orange fireball with bright green surrounding it with a long green trail streaking across the sky from east to west.  No noise at all.  Very fast, but seemed to be low in the sky - large object.  My sister was with me and by the time I yelled at her to look up, it was gone.  Within the minute, we saw a large plane (didn't look like a passenger jet plane at all) with more lights than 'normal' travel in the same direction as the object.  Then the plane circled back as if in search (?).  Very strange - I have never seen anything like this.  I have seen meteor showers - (small, white streaks, high up), and the space shuttle entering the atmosphere....comets....but nothing EVER like this!  I am a college graduate (BS in CS) and now own my own business.  I hope someone will report this!  Other people in Houston had to have seen it.  I cannot find anything in local news or on the internet. ((NUFORC Note:  Based on other reports of the same event, we suspect the correct date for this event may be July 28.  We have amended the date above, and will attempt to confirm the date with the witness.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports of apparently the same event seen over Texas.  It is interesting that the event has not been reported from surrounding states, given that a bright meteor can be seen for hundreds of miles around.  PD));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
A report/video of 7 minutes of an orb spotted & recorded in Houston Texas;2010-06-10 17:00:00;7 minutes;A report / video of 7 minutes of an orb spotted & recorded in Houston, Texas. Hello Peter Davenport,   I would like to report a red/orange orb that I recorded for approximately 7 minutes from around 2010.  I need a location to post these videos.  I have filled out numerous form on a plethora of sites with no response and I just heard your program on Jeff Rense from Friday November 20, 2015. I would like for the video to be available for your next program with Jeff & too see if those that have reported these orbs/fireballs are witnessing the same object if possible. The sky was pasty blue (would have been 'blue' if it were not for the chemtrail residue) with some large white clouds.  It was around 5:00 PM.  The winds were blowing from West to East and the orange red orb that I recorded was moving from East to West (so a Chinese lantern could be eliminated).  After moving to the West for about 2 (two) minutes, the object changed direction to North for about 5 (five) minutes. Once the orb stopped directly above me, it stay there for about 4 (minutes) at which time my neck became to sore to look straight up at. If you would like to view the videos please get back in touch with me. Thanks for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Orange Orb/Ball near Downtown Houston.;2011-07-23 19:20:00;20 minutes;Orange Orb/Ball near Downtown Houston I observed (with camera/have video) an orange orb/ball moving West while the wind was blowing East near downtown Houston with my naked eyes, grabbed by camera and shot about 15 minutes of video.  The object moved from East to West until it stopped exactly South of me, then proceeded North and stopped over head of me, at approximately 10,000 ft.  After recording this event, the object eventually continued moving North and disappeared.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Houston Fireball Triangle;2012-05-26 22:55:00;10 minutes;Houston Fireball Triangle Three fireballs in triangle formation, appearing from the south, slowly drifted in a northern direction.   Each fireball seemed to act as a separate entity, and although each fireball somewhat rotated position, the triangle formation was very closely maintained.  The formation seemed to increase in elevation and slow.  Began to take video with cell phone, cell phone locked up and began making buzzing sound. The formation of fireballs seemed to stop heading in a northern direction and two of the fireballs gravitated towards one another and simultaneously zoomed out of view (out of atmosphere?)  The other lingered, moving slowly in a circular pattern, and then zoomed out of view in the same fashion. Attempted to review video of event on phone- phone states image not available.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
About  9 red glowing objects going up into night sky  formed lines, then triangles, then disappeared.;2012-08-05 22:23:00;about 10 minutes;About  9 red glowing objects going up into night sky  formed lines, then triangles, then disappeared. It was near downtown around 22:23, on August 5, 2012, I looked out my window and seen 3 red glowing objects going up in a diagonal line. I then went outside to investigate.  I called my husband and son outside to witness what I was seeing. My neighbor then came outside and asked what were those objects in the sky. We pulled out our phones and began recording.  The first 3 objects by that time had formed a line straight up, then one went to the right and they disappeared. Followed by them were more objects coming up the same direction. At first we thought they were flares, but they didn’t burn like flares. They illuminated.  Three were now in the sky formed a line like the previous 3, but then formed a triangle and disappeared.  Three more did the same and they were gone. I’ve been searching the news and the web to see if anything has been reported but haven’t found anything.  So I thought I’d report it here. I and my husband have video footage on my phone. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) This is reference to a report I already submitted. I uploaded my video on you tube and here is the link: http://youtu.be/qPDd93nEXyc.  Please excuse the commentary as I was a little freaked out about what I was witnessing.

As I was driving west on I-10 before the Gessner exit, I saw a fire ball, whiter than the sun, and it was in the sky in the same direction as the sun, it came from being invisible materialized then disappeared.   The whole thing lasted less than 3 seconds.   I asked my girlfriend if she saw it, but she was not looking at the sky. so she could not see it.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Red/orange fireballs in Houston sky.;2013-08-10 21:30:00;30 seconds;Red/orange fireballs in Houston sky While sitting outside around our pool at about 9:30 pm, we witnessed 8-12 red/orange balls in the southern sky on the horizon. they were traveling in a north west direction at a fairly high rate of speed.  As each reached about the same spot in the sky, they disappeared into a cloud.  They were in a line, but not a perfect line and they were random distances between them.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Observed very bright  orange lights moving at the same altitude across the sky at normal aircraft speeds till they quickly faded.;2014-11-09 19:50:00;2-3 minutes;Observed very bright  orange lights moving at the same altitude across the sky at normal aircraft speeds till they quickly faded. I live on a suburb on the northwest  side of Houston known as the Bear Creek area. I was doing a little cleanup up in my back yard at about 7:30PM this evening and a bright orange light caught my attention as it was approaching from the west in a direction that I usually observe airlines as they pass overhead to land at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  It began to curve to the north and a second orange light appeared paralleling it a little further to the west. These were no ordinary craft.  They were much brighter that the landing lights that we often see on aircraft.  They were solid without any blinking or pulsing normally associated with known aircraft.  They were a color orange that was almost as intense as looking at a welding arc with almost the same sort of sharpness.  Very orange.  The first thing I thought of was all the reports of the orange fireballs that many people have been sighting lately.  These were definitely self directed. Piloted!  They were moving about as fast as a normal aircraft.  I would estimate that they were at about 3 to 4 thousand feet in altitude.  They appeared to be roughly 500 ft apart. They continued to head in a northwesterly direction at about the same altitude paralleling each other  when another one came into view trailing behind the more westerly one at roughly the same distance. They were in a rough 90 degree pattern all moving in the same direction.  All of this transpired within approximately 30 seconds.  At this time I rushed to call my wife and 18 year old son  to see this. They came out quickly to observe what I was seeing and at that time another light appeared further back and  more to the west. At  maybe 800 ft. further back. As we observed all 4 lights they continued to move in a northern direction and began to fade out one by one. They remained the same brightness till within the last 15 seconds or so when they began to fade and then totally disappear. All of this transpired within about 3 minutes before they were totally gone. They all appeared to remain at about the same altitude and speed the entire time. There was no sound heard by any of us. I attempted to bring out a camera to photograph them, however they were to far away to capture them by the time I was able to retrieve one.  I am 58 years old. My father was in the Air Force for 18 years of my life and I have lived on and around many Air Force bases in the U. S. and in Europe. I am very familiar with many different aircraft and the required lighting that they display. These were not at all “normal” aircraft.  I can also state that my wife, my son and myself have all seen other unexplained craft in the sky at various times in the past, with some that were defiantly not terrestrial. These were some of the most unusual we have ever seen.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I was taking a walk and saw it streaking towards the earth like a comet, only not as fast.  Then it ceased to continue streaking downward, and the entire ‘design’ of fireball with vertical streaks above it, started to fade in brightness and visibility. At first I wondered if a plane was crashing, but there was no sound.  Except for the color, I would have guessed it was a far-away jet, only it was heading directly downward.  I came in the house to Google and find out what it is before it had disappeared entirely.  I didn’t find anything online.  I wondered if there was a satellite or something due to fall to the ocean today.  But then, it never finished falling before it started to fade.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
