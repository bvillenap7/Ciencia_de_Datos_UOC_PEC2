((HOAX??))  At Milby Park, near junction of 610and hwy.225. Extremely cold nite for Houston.;1977-01-14 01:45:00;1 hour;At Milby Park near junction of 610and hwy.225.  Extremely cold nite for Houston. Clear starlit nite. We parked & walked into park & lighted up a joint.  Some moments later I noticed a basketball sized orange light starting to manifest under a small oak tree.  I walked toward the thing curious if this was some sort of hoax.  I circled over&under it with a branch.  It floated. ((NUFORC Note:  The marijuana issue makes us wonder whether this may be a hoax.  In any event, the drug issue makes the report a low priority one.

I saw 2 objects that snined abluish white light on me .;1988-07-19 22:00:00;5 minutes;I saw 2 objects that snined abluish white light on me . n or around July 0f 1988 I witnessed 2 equally glowing objects.They were one on top of another and at a 45 degree angle in the western sky around 10 pm.This occurred a few steps outside my door right after I prayed.I am a believer in Jesus Christ and was going through some difficult times.What I am fixing to tell you is the truth and I have never told anyone these full details.My faith was very weak and I was crying.I asked the Lord for a sign if he was real.I know I am basically a knowbody and when I got up off my knees and looked up in the sky I did not expect to see anything or know what to look for.When I looked up,i saw the 2 objects moving across the sky .It seemed like they knew I saw them because they instantly stopped after about 5 seconds.It was strange because I felt they knew I saw them and stopped because they were aware of me also.Then a blueish white beam of light shined down on me.Without even thinking I went down to my knees with my head down for about 5 seconds.Ithouht this had to be some kind of illusion or religious dillusion.But when I  looked up they were still there and I felt a peace I had never known before or since.They suddenly started moving again at the same rate of speed I had seen at the beginning and then after about 10 seconds they moved like a flash of light and disapeared.I live 3 miles from houston intercontinental airport and have seen all types of aircraft since I was 8 years old.They say ufo's are either man made  and Earthly.not from this world or they have a natural explanation.Because of my experience I believe at least some ufo's could be the way angels and even God himself travels.

It sat motionless for about a minute or so and slowly moved off to the NE and dimmed to the point that I could no longer see it. The plane was flying at about 35,000 feet and the object was about 10-20% of the size of the plane.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Bright red globe with tail or extension seen at  mid horizon level in the east. Dimmed and glowed. Sometimes stopped moving for minutes. Moved from the southeast to northwest and attained altitude. Finally stopped almost directly overhead and slowly went straight up out of sight. Deputy Constable was also a witness at the very high altitude which only provided a red star appearance to her.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Moving bright red light becomes motionless, releases short burst of silvery filaments, then slowly disappears, straight up in the sky.;2001-07-05 00:05:00;25 minutes;Moving bright red light becomes motionless, releases short burst of silvery filaments, then slowly disappears, straight up in the sky. I stepped out onto my back patio, to smoke a cigarette at 12:05am on the morning of July 5.  I had looked at the clock, because I was waiting for my wife to return from the airport.  I immediately noticed a red light, moving generally from west to east.  It was bright enough that I initially thought it was a low flying, small plane.  I thought it would turn, at some point and I would see a blue or white light.  When I did not, I continued to watch it move in the direction of my house.  Then, it slowed and seemed to make a very tight semi-circular turn, then stopped,and became motionless. At this point, I thought it must be a helicopter, but I continued to watch it.  It gradually became a smaller red light, like it was moving straight up.  Then it seemed to stop again.  It appeared to be slowly spinning now, because about every 20 seconds, it seemed to have a dark band, running vertically. I continued to watch it (by now about 15 minutes had elapsed), I saw what looked like a short burst of silvery threads below it (about 2 inches proportionately in the sky ).  At this point, it had the appearance of a red star, in the sky, vs the earlier appearance of a low flying plane.  It then slowly disappeared, as if it was moving straight up.  The sky was clear that night, with no small moving clouds, in the area. I have been thinking about what I saw, since that morning and decided to search the internet, for a place to report it.  I noticed 2 other reports, very similar to my own, so I now know that I was not alone, in viewing this object.  I am a affluent, professional, business man, rational, and not under the influence of drugs.  Once I foud your web site and read the other 2 sightings of the same object, I almost did not report it.  Then I decided I should, since one more description might help in determining what he obect was.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

A dark gray object traveling across the night sky.;2001-10-25 01:31:00;1 minute;A dark gray object traveling across the night sky. On 10/25/01 I was up late (1:30 AM). I decided to go out side before going to bed.    I was looking up at the sky, as usual, and I saw what I believe was a UFO. It didn't have any lights on it (that I could see) but I was still able to see it (very clearly) traveling across the sky, low to the horizon. It was kind of a dark gray in color. It was traveling from east to west. It was oval in shape, and appeared to be traveling at about the same speed a plane would, flying at a low altitude. Yet it appeared to be high in the sky. To get an idea of how big it was from my point of view, go out side, stretch your arm out and hold a quarter up to the sky, flat side facing you. That's approximately how big the UFO was against the night sky.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I was returning from class and saw 5 bright lights (4 light blue, one brilliant white) hovering near my home.  I live near the airport, so assumed planes, but it caught my attention because they never fly 5 in that close of airspace.  Never.  I grew up here,and have witness planes my entire life.  Then, I noticed that they were hovering, not moving.  So I stopped my car, on the street in front of my home, and watched.  Four were silver, one was bright white.  They did not move, at all, and they were very close to one another.  Then I said, almost flip, Ok, I'm home you guys can leave now and the white one gave 4 quick flashes of light, and then began to move between the other 4, which were outlying in a rough circle pattern, though not quite a circle.  They were beauitful, what I could see, and seemed powerful.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

It wa;2005-06-30 20:30:00;12 minutes;While eating dinner at a restaurant in the village I noticed a very bright light directly east of me and coming in my direction.  It was at about 5 to 8,000 feet and looked like a welding rod (reddish white) light with a very long contrail behind it.  This craft was very near or over Hobby airport.  Anyway took about 12-minutes to make a complete rectangle in front of me while finally departing to the south (while maintaining the same altitude).  What I find unusual is the following:  1.  Maintained it's brightness throughout it's movement in the rectangle (so was not a reflection in the setting sun or landing lights).  2.  Numerous Southwest aircraft seemed to completely disappear during this time and did not resume till 9:00 pm.  3.  No engine noise.  4.  Gave off contrails, when no other aircraft before or after did.  5.  Never made out body of aircraft or wings (even as it moved around the rectangle in the sky).  6.  Flew extremely slowly (12 minutes to make a roughly 3-mile diameter rectangle).  I am a pilot, have never seen anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Two light yellowish white luminescent oval objects moving in a straight path at an apparent high speed;2006-04-17 21:15:00;less than 30 seconds;Two light yellowish white luminescent oval objects moving in a straight path at an apparent high speed I saw two light yellowish white luminescent objects that were elongated ovals in shape.  The luminescence was not intense but very obvious. The brightness remained fairly constant.  No windows, blinking lights, no hard solid edges or surfaces were apparent.  Clear sky/no clouds … good visibility.  The two objects were first seen when directly overhead.  Visually appeared to be at a fairly high altitude.  Visually appeared to be traveling at a very fast speed towards the east and in a straight path.  There was absolutely no audible sound generated by the objects during the entire time. The objects traveled in formation keeping maybe one to two widths apart from one another.  One of the objects traveled slightly ahead of the other. The objects maintained one rounded end of the oval shape pointed in the direction of travel.  There were no trails behind them and no apparent lights shining out from any part of the objects.  One of the incredible aspects of these objects is that on one, maybe two brief instances, they smoothly and quickly changed/switched positions in the formation so that now the other object was slightly in the lead.) I was already amazed by this sighting, when I saw the relative movement of the two objects to one another I was in awe!  I am a geologist. I view any natural phenomenon in a very critical light. I have always been extremely critical and skeptical of other reported sightings.   I have never seen/reported objects ever before.  I don’t know what these objects were, but I’ve gone through any logical list of things and nothing makes sense.  Quite often there are aircraft flying in this vicinity heading towards Houston Intercontinental, but these were something quite different.  I don’t know what to think now.

Ufo on 09/29/06 in Houston TX, Oval Shadow-like oblject.;2006-09-29 05:35:00;1min+;Ufo on 09/29/06 in Houston TX, Oval Shadow-like oblject. I was getting off of work on 09/29/06, and my wife and I run our own business. We run a ((deleted)) Agency off of Interstate 10 or the katy freeway in houston, Texas...and as we were walking to the car i spotted in the corner of my my eye that there was an object passing right over our head.  My dad is an aircraft engineer for united so growing up around him, so i know what a plane looks like. it wasn't a plane... had no audible noise. and flew toward a littlte cloud and it stopped dead in its track and went toward a bigger cloud.  After about a minute of hopelessly trying to point it out in the sky so my wife could see it too, she never had a chance to witness it like i did. She does wear glasses and i have 20/20 vision. So i guess she couldn't focus on it.   Two things that seemed odd about this UFO was that no noise, it looked almost like a see through shadow.. Oval-shaped and at the least, i could tell its shaped was horizontally stretched more that its vertical stretch.  I was standing there in amazement for about 20 minutes after that just peering in the sky, just trying to see if i could get anouther look.. the circumstances did allow because as soo as it flew from the smaller could to the bigger one, it gott abit hazey as its shape ever so slightly kept almost poking in and out of the cloud. I Will never foget this experience in my life. Im uttery eft in amazement and wonder about just what it was that i saw. if only i had a camera. I want to know anyone else saw this event on 09/29/06.      - ((name deleted));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Daylight object passes by moon and makes random movements.;2008-06-24 08:45:00;20 MIN;Daylight object passes by moon and makes random movements. It was approx. 8:45 A.M. on the day of June 24th 2008 while I was at work I had walked outside and noticed that the moon was still up fairly high in the sky, still lit very well. I noticed a small object bright white in color, oval shaped, heading in a northwesterly direction. After a few seconds passing by the moon it turned to a directly north heading. It then proceeded on this path for several minutes stopping and starting in its movements. I used the edge of the building to get some kind of reference that the object had actually stopped in mid flight. It seemed to wobble at times when it would start to move then stop again. I kept using the side of the building the entire time to make sure what I was seeing was actually true. I honestly don’t know what I saw but it was unlike anything I have ever seen before. I have no reason to make any of this up and will probably never know what it really could have been but it had an impact on me and my coworkers that viewed it with me.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

It was approx. a 100 yards in front of my car, coming from the north traveling just over the tree line it went over the road in front of me,and continued to the south over the adjacent tree line then dipped behind the trees.   There was no noise, huge and very, very bright. The object was as big or bigger then a boeing jet.  I only could see the side as it traveled across my path.  I'm a christian, and never believed in ufo's.  This has left me stunned and shaken.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

It was just like a quarter second of lights through the clouds.  2 guys in front of me saw it too.  Compass pointing south.  About 45 degrees from horizon line.   Saw it around 945pm central. Located at east down warehouse in downtown Houston  d. I honestly thought it was a plane at first.   We have lots of air traffic here, but it was too big and the lights were different.   It could have just been the right time right place for a cloud to open up to the meteor that skid across only a small patch of clouds  It was fast.  It felt close, like in a low cloud.  It was so fast.  The lights seemed out of this world.   They are a blur in my memory now, but they were amazing from what I remember;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Green oval shaped orb with a small red light at the bottom hoovering over a tree lined cattle pasture.;2016-05-18 04:30:00;1 minute;A green oval shaped orb with a small red light at the bottom hoovering over a tree lined cattle pasture. On Monday, May 17, 2016, around 4:30am in Houston, Texas, I was headed home, traveling westbound on Airport Blvd. between Cullen Blvd and Scott St.  It was raining lightly at the time.    To my left there was a narrow strip of tree lined pasture where cattle graze.  Rising above the trees was a oval shaped green orb that was about 10-15 ft. wide.  At the bottom of the orb was a small red light.  The orb was moving back and forth over the trees.  Since I was the only one traveling on that stretch of the road, I dropped my speed to about 5mph.  I also rolled down my driver side window to get a better look.  I noted that there was no sound and no blinking lights coming from the orb, which made me realize that it was not a helicopter and definitely not an airplane.  I traveled down to the road to a break in the median and made a u-turn heading back towards the ufo.  That’s when it started flying off to the east, increased in speed and disappeared.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
