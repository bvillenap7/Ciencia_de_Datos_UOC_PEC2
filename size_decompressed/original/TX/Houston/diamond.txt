two diamond shaped 'craft' during eclipse;2000-01-20 22:14:00;45 seconds;two diamond shaped 'craft' during eclipse Three normal aircraft passed befoore these. One Copntinental jet, small prop and helicopter. Then I noticed two flying in formation and looked at them with my 20x60 binoculars and saw amber light in front and back. Flourescent blue on the side and one was blinking. Normal craft I could hear but these I couldn't. After they got towards the horizon one just disappeared. I wasn't expecting anything unusual during the lunar eclipse. This is my first sighting as well.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Diamond Shaped UFO in Houston;2001-01-29 21:00:00;10 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  We are suspicious of the planet, Venus, in this instance.  We will attempt to get more information, or other reports.  PD)) Diamond Shaped UFO in Houston I looked outside my kitchen window as I heard the neighbors dogs barking I decided to go outside to take a look I noticed an extremely large white bright light in the western sky positioned south east of the crescent moon. I looked to the sky to compare the many other stars on this clear night and this was about ten times the size of star and appeared to have the shape of a diamond. From my driveway the light or object was not blinking nor did it have any color distortion and seemed to be close in vicinity of my home. The moon was low and the object in perspective was seemingly above a rooftop. I wanted to verify if it had any movement so I gauged it next to a tree limb. It moved up and down slightly within seconds when I had it positioned in the tree. I jumped into my car, driving from Kirby and Westpark at 35 mph and chased it going west towards Newcastle & Westpark. It seemed to be unusually dark in this area of the overpass at Westpark & Kirby (near the midsize electricity plant). It was larger than I previously thought and it seemed to move quite fast in front and away from me going west. At one point I thought I would lose it so I sped up eventually driving around 60 mph passing red lights. On Westpark underneath the 59 overpass I noticed a helicopter flying low coming from the south, going north, the light then dimmed, became hazy and barely visible when the helicopter passed. I pulled into a parking lot on Rice Street and Westpark, to observe the object. Once the low flying, low speed helicopter passed that area, the object dimmed and suddenly disappeared, I assumed it traveled at high rate of speed heading west which made it impossible to see.  This occurred less than a half mile from my home. Upon arriving home the object was no longer in the sky near the tree branch where I had first had seen it. Keeping track of time the entire event took less than 10 minutes.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
diamond-shaped with lights, it split into 7 pieces and fused back together.;2002-10-04 04:10:00;10 seconds;diamond-shaped with lights, it split into 7 pieces and fused back together. we were in our apartment complex at 4am to watch a comet shower, it was my sisters, my dad and me. We were taking pictures with my father's camera and my camera, we were there since 3:30am. On 4:10am, me and my dad saw this UFO flying slow and at a low altitude, it was too slow to be a comet, so i took my camera and took a picture, but i never developed the camera, so i dont know if i got the UFO on a picture. What i noticed about this certain UFO was that it was diamond-shaped with lights surrounding the edges, then all of a sudden the UFO split into 7 pieces and fused back together.

UFO sighting on night of meteor showers;2009-08-12 03:04:00;45 seconds;UFO sighting on night of meteor showers This happens to be the night of the meteor showers.  The report showed that 3-4 AM would be the time of the most significant shower sights.  We had been watching since 2 AM and consistently witnessed showers.  Right after the clock hit three we  we witnessed two more showers, and out of nowhere we noticed what seemed like a star beginning to slowly move through the sky.  We saw a faint blinking red light aside it at first and assumed it was a distant plane.  But soon we had a change of mind as the object which was close to or as distant as the stars flew from one end of the sky to the other in less than forty-five seconds.  We also noticed as it descended from our view that it had a diamond shape and there were acually 3 red lights flashing from one side to the front.  I had thought that UFO's were just made up crap by crazy people. Not anymore.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Update to my report.;2016-10-13 17:00:00;Minutes;Update to my report. Yesterday, I reported seeing a diamond moving over my townhouse in Spring Branch, Texas (Houston),  I go upstairs and I started hearing jets.  I hear passenger jets all the time as I'm under a flight path but these were loud!  I call the dog and we go downstairs, as soon as i got to the same spot I daw saw the object, two fighter jets came flying by!  F-22 or F-16 and they were low and banking.  It made me feel weird as I have never seen that before, not in my neighborhood. I tried to record them but all I got was the sound of engine.     Something went down yesterday for sure.  Around the I-10 & Beltway 8 area I live a little NE of there.  There's a YouTube video fighter jets over Houston somebody else saw them. Thanks!;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Small bright diamond, exposed by the sun.;2016-10-15 17:00:00;Minute;Small bright diamond, exposed by the sun. Was looking south, clear sky and the sun was exposing a small bright diamond.  I thought maybe plane at first but it wasn't.   It was a good clear sighting, it was moving south and sort of curving west.   It went over a large population, I'm sure it was seen by others.  Thanks!
