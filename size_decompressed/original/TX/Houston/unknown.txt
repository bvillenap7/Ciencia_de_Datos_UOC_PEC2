Unusual movements observed of a bright object flying over the Houston skyline.;1975-04-12 07:00:00;30 sec.;Unusual movements observed of a bright object flying over the Houston skyline. I was carpooling with two other teachers to the schools where we taught in NE Houston when this took place. As I looked south from the car I was a passenger in travelling east on the 610 North Loop West I saw a very bright object moving north over south central Houston.  It caught my attention because it was a very bright object and it did not appear to be a plane.  Suddenly it stopped moving and sat still in the sky for two or three seconds.  It then moved straight up and stopped again beneath a cloud formation.  Next a light from the object projected up onto the cloud for a second and then was turned off.  The object then shot up thru the cloud and I lost sight of the object. ((NUFOR Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Unknown object with flashing lights and laser beam behind the Hou ARTCC building/very fast moving;1976-08-01 23:20:00;10 to 13 mins;Unknown object with flashing lights and laser beam behind the Hou ARTCC building/very fast moving I was an air traffic controller at the time.  Often we'd see objects on our radar and on a few occasions NORAD would scramble on them. (That's another topic).   The incident that I'm reporting occurred after the end of my shift. Three of us were hanging around in the parking lot talking.  One controller made a comment that Venus was bright that night.   We then started visibly scanning the sky.  We noticed a brighter light to the North of the ARTCC building and wondered if the other light in the sky was indeed  Venus, then what could that be. (The back door of the center faces east and leads to the back parking lot). The object was standing still and was just visible above the far tree line. Someone made a comment that it was probably a street light.   An airliner became visible climbing out of IAH but farther North of the light we were looking at.  The light then dimmed.  As the plane got farther away on its climb out, the light came back to the full density as we had seen before.  That got our attention.  We were wondering out loud what it could be.   At that moment,  the object moved from our left to our right at an extremely fast speed and stopped immediatley. almost a blur.  As fast as you can turn your head from 10 oclock to 2 oclock was the speed it seemed to move. (if east was 12 on the clock, then the object moved from 10 to 2).  We could not judge how far away from us it was.   The object then just stood still for a minute or two.  Very bright red, blue and green lights starting flashing around the object.  A thin laser like beam of light, approximatley 6 to 12 inches in diameter, lit up part of the parking lot and starting scanning the parking lot.   All three of us ducked behind a car without saying a word.  The beam shut off and the flashing lights stopped.  The   white light on the object then came back on and the object began moving very slowly back to our ten oclock position and stopped at the exact location it was when we first noticied it.  We didn't say a word for about a minute.   When it sunk in what we had just seen, all three of us jumped in our cars and left for home.   The next day, we considered reporting this to a national hotline number in Washington D.C., that the FAA had provided us to report strange occurences that we observe on our radar screens (UFO's)  but no one ever  did for fear of losing our airman's certificate.

My husband and I were driving into our neighborhood after dinner, neither of us had been drinking.   We both saw a white light in the sky, approximately 30 yards in front of us, at a height of 100 yards and no sound.   As soon as I said, did you see that light?  and he answered yes the light disappeared into what seemed like a cloud that suddenly appeared.  I stood in front of our house for at least an hour afterwards trying to figure the light out.   We are still unable to explain it.

An unforgettable witness to a ufo;2002-02-14 01:00:00;Not sure;An unforgettable witness to a ufo I happened to wake up on the night of Februray 13th or the morning of the 14th. I saw an airplane flying with the ufo behind it. I couldnt describe the movement of the ufo because the physics of it is speechless. This all happened in some time between 1 and 3 seconds. I was going  to get up and see it but something forced me back to sleep. It was like a ringing sound. I woke up again still thinking about what I saw then the ringing sound occurred again and forced me back to sleep. But I woke up the next morning still remembering the physics of this object. I know it wasnt a dream because I never could have imagined something moving so fluidly.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Voice mail from something not of this world;2003-01-01 13:00:00;10 min;Voice mail from something not of this world I hate myself for not reporting this when I still had my evidence.   My husband and I were vacationing in Jackson Hole, WY.  Snow skiing for the New Year.   I called home to check my voice mail and got 2, 5 min. messages from something not human.  Every person that I played the messages for (about 12) got chills and freaked out. It sounded like an open mouth exhale followed by strange clicking sound.  Definately animal not a machine breathing in (click, click, click) then exhaling as if it was pronouncing a long h sound.   At one point it screemed a very erie sound as if it was in pain.   I played this very long message for our airport shuttle driver and he asked me to call him and leave a copy on his voice mail.  He may still have it, but I no longer know who it was or his number.   I do not believe this was a prank, for one I don't believe anyone or anything on this planet could make such a sound.  And second the message lasted the entire 5 min that my voice mail held, and then a second 5 min.  A prankster wouldn't continue that long, without somekind of slip up sounding human.  This was definately NOT human!  It was consistant, but not repetitive.  The loud scream happened twice, each a little different, but both very erie.

Peter Davenport requ;2003-08-16 16:00:00;45 minutes;A UFO report that I submitted for August 16, 2003 is not included in the viewable database records on the website. Peter Davenport requested that I re-send my report and have it posted on the 8/16/03 Three Dark Objects entry from Houston, Texas. Here is my report:  While enjoying a sunny afternoon in our backyard swimming pool in southeast Houston near Pasadena, others and I witnessed up to three unidentified, dark objects for a sustained amount of time.  Our experience started in late afternoon (between 4:00 & 5:00) when our neighbor's 10-year old daughter looked up in a mostly sunny and clear sky to see a dark, round-looking object. My 9-year old son, wife and I also saw the object. It was too far away to determine what it what. At first, I thought it to be a small cluster of balloons set adrift. But I noticed that it was stationary, which would seem unusual for free floating balloons at this altitude. Even after viewing the object with low-powered binoculars, I was unable to determine what it was. With my binoculars, though, I was able to notice that it was not completely round and had a irregular shape to it. Though the object was not moving, it swayed occasionally from side to side to show that portions of its body had a lighter color on it. During our sighting, a small-engined airplane flying at a low altitude of 200-300 feet went across our viewing area of the object. The mysterious object looked like it was far higher than the plane.  After viewing the object being stationary for about ten minutes, it slowly moved across the sky, still unable to determine what it was. Once again, it stopped. Several minutes later, my neighbor's daughter pointed out two other dark objects stationed further away from us. They seemed to show the same characteristics of the first object. The latter two objects appeared to be miles apart from each other and eventually made slow movement toward us and the first object. Into 30 minutes of this usually sighting, the first object once again moved slowly across the sky and stopped. The three objects never got close to each other.  In time, my attention returned to our backyard activities. 45 minutes after seeing the first object I looked up to the skies and could no longer locate the objects.  My wife also has no explanation to what she saw that afternoon with us.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
I decided to go out to the car for some reason, as I walked on the third floor walkway I saw out to the western night sky-(very clear)-;2003-08-27 23:00:00;10 minutes;I decided to go out to the car for some reason, as I walked on the third floor walkway I saw out to the western night sky-(very clear)- some lights, at first I thought it were a top on a radio tower and then asked myself about there not being any radio towers there and that high untill it began to move ever so slightly...wel then I figured it to be a passenjer jet so I stopped to watch it fly-by. I watched and waited but it did not seem to go away or come closer so curiosity took over and I looked even closer at this object to see weather it were an small single engine aircraft or helicopter. I watched as this object seemed only to move slightly up down and around in a very narrow window of area, as it began to move more noticibly, it's movement seemed to become erratic with short jerky meandering motions with a strange purposefullness about it. As I watched it I noticed it had 6 lightsin a sort of delta pattern, the lights were blinking simultaneously going from nearly white-(canary diamond white)-to beautifull orangish amber- these colors continued alternating one color change cycle per second for the duration from the time that I actually percieved  the blinking...which was actually from the very beginning. As I watched this object it began to descend a little bit and then it cycled it's lights down to orange then it slowly dimmed out within 2 seconds to a really dark cherry color and then to an allmost black amorphous shape with the still visible dark red color in the center near the bottom of the object. This phase remained for about 5 seconds then the lights turned back on again as it were and the fullest intensity of white light came from the 6 lights and it resumed it's cyclical blinking and then began to ascend diagonally south/southwest...while I was due east of it. The object then leveled off and began to move at a relatively slow pace-(considerably less than common commercial aircraft minus small single prop types)-I then noticed anoth! er same object way to the right/north of the other object and still west of me. The newly appeared object appeared suddenly as out of nowhere, or the timer turned on the lights...well this thing just was going at at least a 70 degree angle and had no difficulty gaining altitude and covered several thousand feet at a speed that  seemed to move around 1500-2000 mph at this time I ran downstairs to show the security guard but I realized that he would not have been able to see it from his perspective and then ran inside to call a friend. I came back outside to look for the first object and noticed that it was not in my field of view anymore and the second was stationary [or it seemed]very high in the sky as if it were a bright star roughly was around the same general vicinity as where I last saw it except higher. I may be mistaken as it might have been a star which seemed to shimmer like a neutron star. I did not bother to continue to watch this star to see any changes and then heard my phone ring so I went to get it. Note:The sky was very clear that night because it had rained a day earlier. I do not wear glasses or contacts and have relatively good eyesight. The entire duration of the movement of the object never once did it or they seem to bank or turn on any deviant axis from their original longitudinal /horizontal fixing...when it or they moved it was only up down or around with a very 2 dimensional quality in the sence -(to repeat )-that they only showed face or one profile continually. The brilliance of the lights made them very cleary defined that is why I can reccolect 6 lights in their pattern on theobjects #1 and #2...as in the order first described. When the #1 first dimmed out to a blackish amorphous object there were originally 6lights on the object untill it went dark then it seemed to have one dark cherry red glow about the center before resuming blink mode. I truly regret not having a video camera or at least a large pair of binoculars, this was an incredible event to me even though some! what surrealistic...the feeling that I got from viewing this/these objects was that of something intelligently controlled with the intention of being seen...with an otherworldly feel from it which gave me chills at one point while viewing it, at the same time being totally exhuberant like I had won the lottery. I am not a pilot or have ever been...I am a sky watcher -(no optics)- I do not posess any licenses or badges etc. Just a regular guy and no less credible according to my own perspective. This is not the first time I have seen strange things of this sort both here and abroad...I suppose that if you look up often enough you will see all sorts of things. I could not really get a relative idea of the distance of the objects because of the unknowable size of them...a crude guestimate would put them at 5 miles near the vicinity of harwin street @ beltway 8 southwest houston or further. I will send a keymap copy of my point of referance.  sincerely j.c. You may make a summary description for me if you wish-feel free to use this as you please and also mail this back to me as for me to have a written copy of this incident as I did not write it in the beginning or cannot remember where I put the rough draft and allthough this may sound contrived it is the truth...thank you .;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

small black object seen over IAH airport during thunderstorm flying from the NW to the SE while airport was shutdown for weather;2006-06-22 17:00:00;5 minutes;small black object seen over IAH airport during thunderstorm flying from the NW to the SE while airport was shutdown for weather During a massive thunderstorm build up over Houston IAH Airport I was standing with 2 other airline employees on the top of terminal A's parking garage out of curiousity, watching the incredibly beautiful cloud formation and intense green blue colors of the thunderstorm.  I noticed, over the nearby parallel north-south runways, a very small black object moving in a straight line under the clouds going in a direction from northwest to southeast ..perhaps at an altitude of 1000 to 2000 feet...its speed was that of a slow moving airplane not a jet...but not as slow as a bird...The winds were gusting to 35mph which I had checked on our company's weather information page prior to taking the elevator to the top floor of the building and the airport was closed at this time for takeoffs and landings. The clouds were literally swirling in 3 directions overhead and windshear must have been pretty strong  ...all air traffic on the ramp had come to a halt and no planes were landing.  This object was big enough to be noticeable but too small to determine the exact shape which was so frustrating though I want to say that it did not look aerodynamic for some reason.  There was no wing flapping motion and even though one of my friends told me it had to be a bird, I'm not certain a bird could hold it course going through a severe thunderstorm without being tossed around or altering its flight path . I would think at this point it would be blown all over the place as even we were being buffeted and pushed around by the winds. Nor could a bird traverse the entire airport In 1 minute as it had crossed the field in a straight line neither moving up or down and as it traversed the airport going south east I could see that the object neither moved to the right or left but continued on this straight axis to the end of the cloud build up....possibly 2 miles away then swung up at the end of the cloud bank and went into the upper clouds in an extreme parabolic path....its flight path was neither typical of a bird or a plane. 1 thing was puzzling and that was even when it was at its closest to terminal A we could not make out its shape yet even when it was far away we could still see the black object....;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Large dark object hovering east to west over Houston Suburbs.;2006-09-25 10:00:00;30 seconds;Large dark object hovering east to west over Houston Suburbs. I was relaxing in my friend's backyard while looking at orions belt and other obvious formations as Houston is too bright to see very much else. Suddenly I noticed something moving in the middle of where I was looking. It was not obvious at all as it was not emitting any light at all. The only way I was able to see it was due to the fact that the moon was pretty bright that night and the shadow underneath this object provided just enough contrast to see it. It was travelling east to west and held a steady speed comparable to a helicopter. It looked either relatively close (like a helicopter) or very huge. Really, it seemed both big and close. It is hard to tell with no light coming from it though. Either way it would have been close enough to hear if it was a helicopter or airplane or anything with an engine. The shape was large and seemed round. It was absolutely silent and gave me a very creepy feeling. It was dare I say it...camoflauged against the night's sky. I looked away a few times to make sure it wasn't a spot on my eye or something in my head and found it everytime I came back to it. I called my friend over after I could make some words out. He didn't get up in time and it was hard to make out if you weren't watching it the whole time. I then lost it behind an unavoidable tree blocking our view. I never saw it come out the other side either. If I had to make a guess as to it's path it seemed close enough and travelling in the right direction  to be generally following or flying over the bayou. Which would be a very discrete path to take for any object trying to hide. It left me shaken really as I knew something was flying low and big and silent and dark as the sky. It was pure luck I was practically looking at it as it crossed my eye while watching stars. I am not sure as to when this day was exactly as I forgot to post here. But it was last year before it got really cold. Maybe October instead of Sept. I would like to be contacted by e-mail to see what you guys think and if you've ever gotten reports of things dark with no lights as I don't see many.

EVERY star in the sky was white, white maybe a bluish twinkle to it. this was just red blinking light. but it was so tiny to see, i was thinking maybe it was mars, i know thats red, and maybe the atmosphere made the blinking just much more apparent. after 10 minutes of wondering what it was, i remembered my video camera.  i am an aviation minded person, and i live near BUSH (hobby) airport. i know what an airliner looks like at 40 k, at night....this was MUCH higher. what i did notice about what i saw, was how it moved...but so slow, that i couldn't recognize it at first. the only way was to use reference points on the horizon (my house) over time. when i noticed it didn't follow the same path as the rest of the stars, i started to doubt myself. at first it was moving towards a solo star in the southwestern side of the sky. minutes later, checking my same reference points. it had moved away considerably from the solo star. it also  had two smaller items that were emitted. they were bright white, floated around the red blinker, back and forth a few times, then rejoined. this happened twice. (but not caught on film.)  with the camera, i could then tell it was TWO rapid strobes next to each other going off. but, it also emitted green color as well. it was a third color, but not a third bulb  so both lights went from red to white, and sometimes green. but it was FAST!! like hyper speed Morse code...  the thing disappeared to my naked eye, but i could still hold it on the camcorder. but it was fading. it didn't go below the horizon it didn't take off like a rocket, in some direction..it just FADED...not like an aircraft going over a large distance.i searched for another ten minutes. couldn't find it again.  have 30 minutes of footage (roughly 10 minutes actual, on and off). have no idea what it is.  here is a quick video that i did for an onlinde aviation forum . this is heavily cut just for quick and dirty purpsoses to see if they have any idea. i have no clue what it is, the way things are these days, its hard to tell, so i try not to speculate...it is what it is.

Then I wake my mom and she saw that too, but she didn't know what is it either. We saw it was flashing in blue and red and it is just like turning around and around.It was more than less at the same position for half an hour.

I did see hints of other colors, but very dim in comparison.  The movements made it impossible to be a helicopter, plane, or anything known to the public that I'm familiar with.  No sound either.  We have been watching the sky a lot since hurricane Ike. Unbelievable bright, the brightest thing I've seen except, for when we saw the same exact thing from the same vantage point, in January I think, and then we saw the news that thousands all over texas had seen them, and people in houston saw the same thing we did, that's why I'm reporting it this time.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

My son video the objects from his cell phone but he couldn’t see the aircrafts circling the objects he was in another area of the town in Houston. I, my husband and my other son saw the aircraft circling the objects in our area of Houston. I can have him send it to you. We didn't stay outside to see the objects leave it was too unbelievable and a little frighten to stay outside and watch the objects. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Jupiter and Venus, which are very prominent in the western sky, at the time indicated by the witness.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) We were looking North West and it appeared to be two objects, reason I am saying two objects is because one size of the light was larger then the other light ,it could have been one large object with two very bright lights since the lights were diagonally from each other.  We could not see sharps or sizes or anything else because of the objects lights were very bright like a star light but, we knew we were not viewing stars because they were position to low from the sky, same height that you could view an airline flying in the sky.  My son's cell phone is old and he is having a problem sending the video from his cell phone to me by email or to my cell phone but I am going to take his phone to the cell phone company to see if they can upload it to my email ((END ADDENDUM));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
A flash of green light, fire trail in the sky and no reports on the news of a plane exploding, etc.;2012-12-07 06:35:00;seconds;A flash of green light, fire trail in the sky and no reports on the news of a plane exploding, etc. Around 6:30 A.M. the wife and I were walking our dogs in the backyard.  I was talking to my wife who was nearly twenty feet away from me.  A flash of green light hit the backyard and my wife looked up and saw a yellow trail that might have been fire.  (She says like the back to the future trail left by the car).  Bright trail that slowly faded away.  At the same time the yard lit up, I was looking for cars, there were none.  There were no sounds.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Yellow & blinking green then solid green and red. Hovered fast vertical & horizontal up and downs, turns and arches complex maneuvers;2014-02-19 21:20:00;10 minutes;Yellow & blinking green then solid green and red. Hovered fast vertical & horizontal up and downs, turns and arches complex maneuvers While enjoying the evening air, my girlfriend and I observed what appeared to simply be a commercial airliner making its final approach to Houston - until it stopped and hovered at an altitude of at least 1500 feet.  It was mostly cloudy at the time.  At first the object was a whitish-yellow light like a plane with also a blinking green light.  It later changed to non-blinking green and red lights only, arranged horizontally.  We were looking due west. As experienced birdwatchers,  I got our binoculars for a better look.  It moved more quickly, complexly and unexpectedly than any aircraft I've ever seen.  It dropped and ascended vertically several times, very, very fast.  It moved back and forth horizontally very fast and made several complex turning and arching maneuvers as well.  My girlfriend suspected we might be seeing a toy remote controlled aircraft.  I didn't think so.  Who would be out on a cloudy night like this in the middle of the week in a residential neighborhood flying planes?  It made no sound.  My girlfriend has worked for a major corporation for 25 years.  I'm employed in the healthcare industry.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Airplane look- two red lights- flying- stopped in mid-air for 14 seconds- then came straight down rapidly;2015-06-30 22:00:00;2 minutes;Airplane look- two red lights- flying- stopped in mid-air for 14 seconds- then came straight down rapidly Very strange    Object appeared moving East to West at something close to normal plane speed in Eastern sky.  The reason I noticed it was that it had only two red lights--not the normal red, white and green seen on airplanes.   Then it stopped- just plain stopped- for maybe 10 to 15 seconds- then began a rapid descent straight down- It wasn't too far from me- perhaps anywhere from 1 to 5 miles East of my location- the Spring Branch area of Houston- which is approximately 12 miles west of downtown.   I was glad it wasn't closer because it may have been out to take someone or something.  It disappeared behind the tree horizon and did not reappear.  I'm sorry but did not have camera with me.  It did not come down like a helicopter- but it motored straight down- weird.  Actual shape was not evident but similar to plane.

Green light flashing then descending rapidly until out of sight.;2015-10-02 23:41:00;1 minute;Green light flashing then descending rapidly until out of site. 	During a walk around 11:40 pm I noticed a green light flashing in the sky.   I stopped to stare at the light and it appeared to be hovering in place.  The light then began to move to the left slightly still hovering.  The flashing of the light was at a constant rate similar to the flashing light of an aircraft at night.  The light began to move to the left again and the light disappeared.  The light then appeared again and the it hovered for a few seconds until the light started to descend rapidly.  After this the light was out of sight.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I saw 4/5 flashes of bright neon colors like orange, pink, yellow, and green.  It was very close to the ground, but in the gray night.  I couldn't take a picture and it lasted for about 7 seconds.  It had no sound.  Afterwards, it became very dark and I couldn't see anything. Then, 4/5 birds flew away and it kept raining a bit harder.  Also, during this time we had a power outage.  Soon after, the power came back on. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
