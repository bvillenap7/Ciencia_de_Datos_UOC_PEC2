Formation of four star like lights appearing and reappearing.;1986-12-31 21:00:00;15-20 seconds;Formation of four star like lights appearing and reappearing. I do not have an exact date or time of this event. It could have been between mid 1986 and mid 1987, so I arbitrarily assigned it December 31, 1986. The time of 9pm or 2100 hours local is also approximate.  The precise information was recorded in a log book that I used to record astronomical measurements in and was later stolen in a home burglary. And I can only guess the above dates because of other information that was recorded before and after the log book was stolen. Also the Houston area is not much of a seasonal place so that does not help my recollection.  The following is the best of my recollection.  The formation of lights appeared in my northwest sky at about azimuth 315 and about 30 degrees altitude up from my horizon. The formation was 4 white lights parallel to the horizon appearing as two pairs of lights with about twice the distance separating the pairs as was between each light in the pair. The brightness of these lights were around 4th magnitude star lights and appeared as such - point light source stars.  The lights were steady and not twinkling. The angular width of the formation was about 1 degree. This formation of lights changed location in the sky within an area of about 4 degrees. I based the approximate degree measurements using the width of the index finger at arms length to be about 1 degree. The formation moved from its initial location down about 1-1/2 degrees and to the left about 1 degree, and then from that location moved about 2-1/2 degrees to the right and down about 2 degrees. The lights did not move but instead disappeared and reappeared in a different location as noted. These were the only movements I can recall and then they disappeared completely.  When the lights changed location it was and instantaneous movement meaning the lights did not disappear for some time then reappear. This was in fact what caught my attention to begin with so I really don't know how long they were doing this movement before I noticed them. There were no other noticeable objects or lights in this area of the sky. There was no other apparent motion with the lights. There were no sounds. There was no noticeable object associated with the lights. The formation of the 4 lights never changed its shape. I assumed these lights to have been at a very great distance away from my location. There were clouds in that area of the sky and I viewed the event through an opening in the clouds that stayed open during the entire event. This was all viewed using only unaided eye vision - no telescope or binoculars, etc... The event duration was probably about 15-20 seconds.

4 oblects moving in A tetrahedral pattern, with A fourth object directly behind;1998-10-05 20:55:00;5 to 8 minutes;I was taking out the trash at 8:55 pm monday night the 5 th of october.after dumping the trash I was observing the sky,and the inter-mittent cloud cover that was rolling through our area.And looking up to my right hand side which would have been looking to the west I saw 4 oblects moving in A tetrahedril pattern, with A fourth object directly behind it, right in perfect line with the other three objects.and directly to the east of where I was standing there was another formation exactly the same as the formation I had just observed. I was taking out the trash on 10/05/98 at approxamitely 8:55 pm after dumping the trash,I was observing,the very fast moving inter-mittent cloud cover when I observed the first 4 objects to the west of my position,they were in A very tight formation, with the lead craft lit up like A florescent light just as white as you could get.with the fourth,object directly behind it, but the way it was behind these other craft it was perfectly center'd that the way it looked from my position that you could of drawn A straight line through the middle of the formation, not only that but directly to the east of where I was standing there was another group of 4 U.F.O.'S. In exactly the same formation as the first group.Now to the weird part of the sighting, in both group's the lead object was the only one that was illuminated,but there was A full moon tonight wich to me should of lit them up A little bit but they were as dark as the night sky including the trailer on both group's. I observed the two group's for about 5 to 8 minutes cloud cover permitting.the location of my sighting was on the north side of the town 1/4 mile west of I-45 north and the airtex exit.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Seven blueish discs flying in V formation making no sound.;1999-11-18 05:00:00;20 seconds;Seven blueish discs flying in V formation making no sound. I went outside to observe the Leonid Meteor event before going to work.   While looking at the sky I noticed movement among the stars.  Moving very fast from east to west were seven pale blueish discs flying in a V formation.  There was no sound and they were out of site in about 20 seconds.   Were these exhaust ports on a delta shaped craft?  Without binoculars I could not tell.   I asked our local HUFON group if anyone had seen them.  I reported the sighting to MUFON but neither group responded.   I haven't thought about it until last Friday when UFO's, Seeing Is Believing was aired.  Seeing is believing!

Three red light formation over Houston;2002-11-19 03:40:00;8~10 seconds;Three red light formation over Houston I was watching for meteor shower activity and observered 3(three) non-blinking red lights in a tringular formation, moving from North to South at a constant speed. Altitude and speed uncertain as I don't know the size of the craft.  The observed phenomenon crossed a 50(fifty) degree arc above the city of Houston and disappeared into cloud cover in a duration of approx. 8~10 seconds.  When I lost sight of these lights, I noted the time of 03:40AM-CST(US). There were no unusual sounds ocurring during or for several minutes after the observation. Almost exactly one-half hour later, at approx. 04:10AM-CST(US), I observed what appeared to be a commercial aircraft(red and white blinking lights) prodeeding in a direction from NE to SW(compass heading approx 210~230 degrees), already at altitude, possiblly from IAH(Bush), Memphis, DFW, or Little Rock, destination unknown.

Three dark mysterious objects in the afternoon sky;2003-08-16 17:00:00;45 minutes;Three dark mysterious objects in the afternoon sky On the afternoon of Saturday, August 16, other individuals and myself witnessed a prolonged sighting of three, dark mysterious objects in the blue skies in southeast Houston near Pasadena.  While in our backyard, my son's 10-year guest first drew our attention to an object floating in sky at about 5:10 in the late afternoon. At first, the object looked like a dark dot in the sky and was too high to determine what it was even with my low-powered binoculars. Initially, I dismissed it a cluster of balloons set adrift. But then I noticed that the object was stationary which was unusual especially at this altitude. At times, it would sway back and forth to show that the object had an irregular shape. As it swayed, a lighter shade of color could be seen on its body. It was my wife's opinion that it was not balloons.  After some ten minutes, the object slowly started drifting through the sky. During this period, a small non-commercial plane, at an altitude of several hundred feet flew by between us and the object. The object stopped once again after traversing what I think were miles. We were still unable to determine what it was.  Then my son's friend alerted us to two more similar objects further out in the horizon. One of the objects slowly drifted to our direction but still not close enough to determine what it was. At about 5:40, all three objects could seen, stationary and distanced from each other by miles of blue skies.  Eventually, my attention was drawn back to our backyard activities. By 6:00, as we turned our attention back to the skies, we could no longer see the objects.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Two craft near Houston witnessed by 8 people....AMAZING!!!  Pictures taken...;2004-07-23 21:12:00;21 minutes;Two craft near Houston witnessed by 8 people....AMAZING!!!  Pictures taken... I crested a highway hill on a trip b/w Austin and Houston.  As I crested the hill, I noticed 4 cars stopped on the side of the highway, people out of their cars, staring into a field to the left of the highway.   I noticed two lights in this field moving quickly, sporadically.  I stopped my car and got out.  I recorded the following events on my CELL PHONE CAMERA.  I have 8 pictures of the event.   There were two lights/crafts.  They would float above the ground about 10 feet, and just kind of jerk back and forth, as if hound dogging above the ground.  Then, one craft shot directly up and became bright pink.  The other craft turned bright white and shot to the right and behind a hill.  They both came back together to the original area, and their light was dimmed.   Then one of the craft started to glow orange. and shot up about 50 feet, then back to the ground, and the two just circled a bit.   Then one turned a bright green and started this zig zag movement, and the other one turned blue and shot to the right.  They traded places in the sky, and one of the pictures I recorded shows a distinct blue saucer shape.   They then came together, turned a bright pale yellow, and shot up straight in the air.  They were gone.   All of the witnesses shared their experiences before departing, changed forever.  We believe we witnessed a true encounter.   When we went to leave, we had no idea that we had spent 21 minutes observing this phenom.  It was as if time had not passed in outselves.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Large Boomerang formation of lights over Houston, Beltway 8 & Westheimer moving north to south 10/10/07, 9:43 PM.;2007-10-10 21:43:00;35 seconds;Large Boomerang formation of lights over Houston, Beltway 8 & Westheimer moving north to south 10/10/07, 9:43 PM. Went out in my back yard at around 9:43 PM Wed. Oct. 10th to let dogs go to bathroom.  Neighbors dog barking on the east side of my house, looked in that direction and noticed a large boomerang formation between 5,000 - 7,000 ft. altitude, 45 degrees above the east horizon about 300+ yard across.  Moving from north to south along Beltway 8 corridor from Westheimer to Hwy 59 south before I lost sight.  Clear night.  No sound.  At first thought it may be one large single object but as it moved along, noticed some of the 20+ lights moved out of formation slightly so figured they were independent objects moving in formation like a flock of geese.  Having seen geese migrate all my life, quickly ruled this out.  Lights had an orangish/yellowish tint but seemed to be slightly fuzzy.  When the formation moved in front of the stars, the stars would obscure slightly but still be visible so that is also why I believe it to be multiple objects.  I have extensive knowledge of aircraft and know when I am looking at a plane, helicopter, meteor, or satellite in orbit.   Looking from my back yard to the south I can observe approaching aircraft from the west into Hobby airport, but this thing came from north to south and I first observed looking due east.   It made me think, “Phoenix Lights” when I thought about it later because of the boomerang/wedge shape and the color and it being right over the forth largest metro area in the country.   I have no doubt other people in the city probably saw this but just wrote it off as something ordinary.  In fact the only reason I am posting this here and on MUFON is so if anyone else in town saw it and is curiously searching and reads this, knows it was something very unusual and was real.

enormous circle of lights over westhiemer;2007-10-12 22:30:00;unknown;enormous circle of lights over westhiemer With two other passengers in the vehicle, we were driving back to our hotel on Westheimer driving away from the Galleria area. The street was bustling w/ city night life. I looked up through the open sun-roof while stopped at a light and noticed a non-blinking, off white light and it was not moving fast nor did it have any other blinking lights. Then I noticed another one yars away, then another, then another, equal distance apart eventually forming what looked like a circle. It was just hovering and I could not see anything beyond the lights, just blackness. We eventually proceeded forward and the lights seemed as if they were moving slowly but we lost sight of them. I have never seen anything like them. My Mother had a theory that they were satellites? Really?;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Saw four circular lights flying quickly in formation and then change formation, there was no sound, helipcopters circled around shortly;2008-09-26 01:00:00;5-7 seconds;Saw four circular lights flying quickly in formation and then change formation, there was no sound, helipcopters circled around shortly I was standing in my backyard at approximately 1pm in the morning having a smoke and letting the dogs relieve themselves.  I looked in the sky to see four circular lights flying in a square :: formation.  At first I figured it was an airplane until it registered how fast they were going and that there was no noise whatesoever.  I then saw them change formation into what appeared was going to be a V shape formation, but then changed into a diagonal line (from my perspective at least) like so .... but diagonally from left to right. The color of the lights were white/yellowish with a hint of light blue, but were behind a thin layer of clouding so I can't be sure the exact color.  I'm sure it wasn't a commercial aircraft because of how fast it was moving and the fact that the lights moved from their original formation.  I can't rule out that they could have been military craft, however the following is what leads me to believe they are not.  (or at least what military craft are available knowledge to the public.)  1. They made no noise whatsoever.  Not even after they were gone.  There was no trailing engine noise. 2. The speed and seemingly effortless way they manuevered into another formation.  They changed direction faster and more fluently then military aircraft would be able to handle.  As I said earlier, they went from :: to V to a diaganol line .... in a matter of about 5 seconds. 3. The fact that they were just lights... just a circular light.  No flashing, no additional lights, just a solid circle of light. 4. Under a minute later some helicoptors could be heard in the vacinity..  Tho as to whether or not they were there for the spectacle is beside me.  If they were, there would be no way they could have matched the UFOs speed. So that is my sighting.  I personally am convinced they were not commecial or military aircraft.  If the goverment has some black project for new craft and propulsion systems, that is another story.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Two sets of lights in the night sky.;2013-11-07 00:45:00;10 seconds;Two sets of lights in the night sky I arrived home from work at about 12:45 am on 11-7-2013.  As usual I looked above my house and saw some stars in the sky, due to light pollution it is difficult see any but the brightest stars in the night sky.   When I looked up I some some movement in the sky, I thought it was an aircraft since I do see many commercial jets flying over my house at all hours of the day, but there were no flashing lights and the lights were barely visible.  Normally when aircraft fly over the house they fly in a north-south pattern, these lights were moving west to east which was unusual.   The lights were in a triangular shaped formation, it looked to be about seven to nine lights flying in the sky.  The lights moved slowly across the sky, within about 7 seconds they moved behind the tree in my front yard and then disappeared from my vision. 	I was trying to locate the lights again and make sense of what I had seen when my vision again moved above the house to look at the stars in the city night sky.  I then saw another light, this one singular, move from south to north in the sky above my house.  Both of these lights were noticed in the direction of the Orion constellation.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Orange lights in the night sky in a formation.;2014-09-27 20:15:00;4;Orange lights in the night sky in a formation. On September 27, 2014 at approximately 8:15 pm I and my parents witnessed orange lights in the night sky.  These are exactly like the ones that have been reported in different parts of the world. We witnessed these lights on Barker Cypress Rd located in Houston TX 77084. We are in shock.  There were originally 3 lights in an L formation then after 20 seconds about 20 orange lights appeared.  They were in the sky moving for about 2 minutes then they just completely disappeared.  These Lights were large. We were and are in shock. The whole process took about 4 minutes.  We stopped the car at the edge of the street and tried to take photos but our phones would not capture them. We are perplexed by these orange lights.  They cannot be planes since they were silent and completely disappeared plus the huge number just would not make sense. I hope this is helpful with any studies or anything in particular. The unknown is quite frightening but awfully interesting. We have! 1 blurry image.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Lower end of the line starting on the west and climbing upwards towards the east.   Line consisted of clusters, resembling birds' flying triangles.  One small cluster was placed a bit further south-east.   Altogether they were close to 100 lights.  They never moved, just set there suspended in the air, then just disappeared. There was also a light of a plane passing by, which in comparison to these lights was way smaller. Please let me know if you need any more info, I can still see it in my mind.

The last one standing appeared to have a red light hovering by it, maybe an airplane or chopper.  The objects were large and bright.
