This is about a craft with a circular beam of light that could penetrate through a roof and ceilng of a house.;1971-09-15 18:00:00;45 min.;This is about a craft with a circular beam of light that could penetrate through a roof and ceilng of a house. I was at my cousin's wedding in 1977 when my uncle came up to me and said he had a story to tell me.  He said he wanted to tell me because I was a scientist (actually an archaeologist).   He said he had been visiting our family lawyer who had been a judge for many years, in his hospital room a few weeks before he died.  The judge told my uncle that he wanted to tell him something he had never told anybody because of the sensitive nature of the story and his being a past judge and lawyer.   He said he was out dove hunting in the woods with his wife and two friends just before sunset.   He said all of a sudden a large circular shaped object about 60 ' in diameter came over them.   They got scared and got in their jeep and started back to the ranch house.   A cylinder of light came down from the craft that was the same in diameter as the UFO and followed them all the way back to the house.  They never left the circle of light.   Once they arrived at the house, they jumped f! rom the jeep and ran inside.  The craft then came directly over the house.  The light was so intense, it actually came through the roof and ceiling of the house and into the room where they stood.  It hovered over the house for some minutes and then went away. The reason for finally telling this story is that there was no reason for my uncle to lie (he didn't drink at this time), and certainly there was no reason for the judge to make up such a story on his deathbed.  I just thought some one should hear this story. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I looked at and saw a large craft, that if I open my arms and put it in the air in a v shape, it would show about a five mile wide or possibly ten mile wide craft.  It seemed to be about 5 to 800 feet off the ground and hovered there for about 5 minute. I noticed all the clouds around it and the blue in the sky and the skin of The Craft seem to be like the mother of pearl on a clamshell.  It seemed to move with an iridescent and had a dark tone to it and yet a silverish iridescents to it.  It was the largest object that ever seen the sky and I was quite stunned it wasn't sure what I was looking at. It shot off into the West sky as fast as lightning and I tried to follow it but was too fast.  And then a brite pink color filled the sky and flashed across the whole horizon.  It seemed like I could taste or even hear the color.  Was very bizarre for my young mind and I was trying to figure it all out, when my uncle suddenly jerk me up by the arm and rushed me and my brother into the house and deadbolt the door and latch the chain and was peering out the window on the door. My uncle what it was and he sternly told me,Shhh! Be quiet, don't say anything!!! He then told me to go sit down in the living room and don't say anything to anybody about it. I knew what I had seen was out of the ordinary and I didn't understand exactly what it was oh, but I knew that it was something not from this planet. My intuition told my young mind that it was from somewhere else.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
UFO hovers over Houston TX, fall 1973.;1973-10-15 19:30:00;45 minutes;UFO hovers over Houston TX, fall 1973. I was at Memorial Park in Houston TX in the evening during autumn 1973, along with my husband, and a group of men and their wives.  The men were playing tag football.  I was sitting in a lawn chair facing due south.  The game had not started and the men were warming up for the game, when I saw what I thought was an airplane flying from east to west in the night sky.  As my eyes tracked it, it suddenly came to a standstill.  I mentioned this to the lady sitting next to me.  She said she had binoculars in her car. She retrieved them, and handed them to me.  When I looked at the object through the binoculars, and discovered it was not just one light, but a string of lights in a horizontal position.  I did not attempt to count the number of them.  As I  and others watched, the object appeared to began turning on its side gradually.  It changed, bit by bit, from a straight string of lights to an oval, and then ultimately to an full circle of lights.  Other people became interested and also watched this phenomenom.  It turned back into a horizontal string of lights, and then moved vertically.  I could see what appeared to be after-flares coming from each light.  The object remained there for approximately 45 minutes moving this way and that, and then suddenly ascended within a matter of a few seconds upward and to the west.  I have prepared a rudimentary illustration with Adobe Photoshop to show how this object revolved, and yet remained in a stationary position over Houston.  I made no report of this at that time.  There was a lot of debunking going on regarding UFOs and I did not care to get involved.  I know what we saw.  Only in the past year did I send a pencil sketch to MUFON.  I received no reply from them.  It has been many years since I watched this UFO in the night sky, but it still stands out clearly as if I had just seen it moments ago.  Other than my husband, I have no recollection of anyone else's name who had been a witness to this event so long ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We watched a UFO at night through binoculars.;1974-10-20 19:30:00;45 minutes;We watched a UFO at night through binoculars. I do not recall the exact date, as the sighting was years ago.  It left an indelible impression on me.   I know that it occurred at night over Houston, TX between 1973-1974. We were attending a men’s flag football league game at Memorial Park.  My husband was one of the coaches.  I was seated in a lawn chair watching the game.   I saw what I thought was an airplane crossing the sky, but it suddenly came to a full stop.   I mentioned it to the lady sitting next to me.   She said she had binoculars in the car and would get them. What I saw through her binoculars (and other people there, too) was actually not just one light, but a string of lights.  I do not recall the exact number of lights in a row that I saw, maybe 5-7.  They were close together. My husband was getting exasperated, as the football players all wanted to watch the object through the binoculars. As we watched this object, it appeared to be turning slowly in various directions.   The string of lights would change into a narrow oval, gradually expanding until it became a full circle of lights.   It kept hovering for approximately 45 minutes, continually changing shape from a string of lights, to an oval, and to a full circle, the reversing the direction of turning.   It even turned so that it was completely vertical, with what looked like flares coming from each light, yet it appeared totally stationary in the sky.   There were no colored lights, just bright white ones. All of a sudden, the object ascended in a southwestly direction and was gone within seconds.

2 experience with unkown;1984-10-10 05:00:00;1 minute;2 experience with unkown It is happen so many eons ago, I am not sure about year: something between 1982 and 1984. I didn’t think that you would be interested, but as I listened to you on Coast to Coast I understood that I should write it down. I was walking around 5am to the bus stop to get to my job and I usually took the shortest way to the bus using back door of my back yard. Back of my house was facing the bayou and across of that was just empty space (later on apartments were build there)    As I started to walk I looked at the sky and saw full moon on my left across the bayou over the empty space.  And something felt strange: moon looked reddish and was low, not up in the sky.  And then I looked to the right of me, and there was a real moon in the sky!  I suddenly was scared and run as fast as I could to the bus stop. Next morning I decided to take a long way to the bus stop (it was a different stop and it would take me 10 minutes longer, but I would by walking by houses in the neighborhood).  As I turn to one of the streets I saw a black van parked on the street in front of one of the houses and in near the van I saw 2 tall men standing and watch what I thought several children playing on the front yard I am nearsighted so it took me sometime when I came near the children to see that it was not children, and either I blocked instantly what those beings look like or it was blocked from me.  I was terrified  from what I saw and I could not even describe it immediately when  I happened.  I started to run (in my mind I heard that they were amused my terror).  I run all the way to the bus. That is my 2 experiences which I want to report. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the dates of the sightings are approximate.  PD));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Thursday morning Nov. 18 at around 5:00 AM, I went outside to view the Leonid Meteor Shower before getting ready for work.  I saw a few bright ones and was about to go back in the house when I noticed movement out of the corner of my left eye (I was facing south).  I saw 7 or 8 luminous circles flying in a V or chevron formation.  They were moving very fast east to west and made no sound.  They covered an area about the size of my thumbnail held at arms length.  The circles were not bright and had they not been moving, I probably would not have seen them.  They were out of sight in about 20 seconds.  Afterwards I wondered if these circles were on the underside of a large delta shaped craft since the allignment was maintained. I am 65 years old and have been interested in astronomy since I was 13.  I have never seen a UFO before.  The local UFON group had no reports that day.  I guess I was just lucky.

As always, never fails, everytime I sense a sighting, I see one. I was outside on my smoke break with 2 other co-workers. They were talking amongst themselves and I was looking up. Keep in mind that my boss ridicules me all of the time about the UFO phenomenon. I looked up and saw a circular moving dot in the sky. I called on them to witness the sight. One girl saw what I had seen and my boss was not able to see, or should I say, saw what he wanted to see. He kept squinting and never was able to see anything. The close-minded friend of mine said it was a balloon, but what kind of balloon travels so high in the air without exploding-NONE!!!! There was another sighting during the first one of another disc flying directly above the first one. I had called on another co-worker to witness the sighting and she confirmed it. People have to come to their senses and accept the fact that we are being visited by other beings from other worlds. Many of them at that.

Saw two black objects hovering over Houston;2002-08-06 18:00:00;20 minutes;Saw two black objects hovering over Houston I was standing on the balcony outside my bedroom when I noticed two objects in the southwestern sky.  They looked very black to me.  One was circular and the other was an irregular shape which I thought at first was a hangglider or something.  But they were moving so slowly that I couldn't figure out what I was looking at.  The circular object was closer to me and both objects were slowly moving Southwest away from me.  Soon the irregular one was out of sight and I pulled my video camera out and taped the circular one until it disappeared into the clouds away from me.  Maybe it was a weather balloon, but I still can't figure out what that second object was.  Bizarre.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

UFO SIGHTED HOVERING AT REAR OF HOUSTON RESIDENCE. Richard & June  H. /HUSBAND & WIFE WITNESS;2005-10-15 04:32:00;5 minutes;UFO SIGHTED HOVERING AT REAR OF HOUSTON RESIDENCE. & WIFE WITNESS  ((names deleted)) My name is ((deleted/husband's name))and my wifes name is ((deleted/wife's name)).  We are in our 50's and are both professionals and do not drink nor do any type of drugs.   This past Saturday night in Houston I was awakened at exactly 4:32 AM (clock stopped) by a vibration that was making our house vibrate and a single laser beam type of light that was inadvertently flashing into the living room windows of our residence. The house next door to our residence is empty due to a fire in the house and the owners are renovating the house but do not live there now.  I woke up and stepped over to the sliding glass doors that open onto the second level balcony of our home and peered out the sliding glass doors. What I saw was such a shock that when my Wife asked me what was going on, I could not really speak, I could only wave her over to the sliding glass doors. An oval shaped object, approximately 50 to 60 feet long was hovering over our swimming pool and backyard.  It was approximately 25 to 30 feet high and was putting out a golden glow from the bottom of it.  The craft had a very low golden sheen about it and looked almost transparent, you couldnt see thru the object but unless you were really looking for it, you could easily miss it. There was a type of shuddering vibration eminating from it that came in waves.  We both were in shock and were afraid to make any sound or really move.   We have several outdoor cats that are our pets and a dog.  Our cats ran underneath the wooden deck that surrounds our swimming pool and our dog, ((dog's name deleted)), laid down with his head between his paws and would not move nor lookup.  ((dog''s name deleted)) after approximately 1 or 2 minutes raised up and ran into his make shift den area under a picnic table that we have in the backyard. The craft was within 50 to 75 feet of where my wife and I were standing inside our bedroom looking out the 2nd floor balcony of our bedroom. I told my Wife that I was going to run downstairs and take a picture of the craft but she became very upset and almost broke my hand holding onto me, not really making any sounds but let me know she was afraid that whatever was in the craft might come out to recover any type of documentation and come into our home. We watched it hover for about 5 minutes, noticed there was a dull light on the swimming pool and then it slowly rose and moved away slowly and in a trajectory that was almost straight up, the rate of climb would be at an estimated angle of 60 degrees at about 20 to 25 feet per second. We were up all night. The next morning we went outside and the water level of the swimming pool had dropped almost 6 inches from the time of the incident.  That is really the only significant and viable impact the craft left besides the clocks all losing about 5 minutes. We sat up all night last night to see if it would return.  It did NOT return. This was an extremely intense and emotionally draining experience. ((names deleted))  in Houston Texas;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Instead of a backyard, I have a forest behind my house. Last night, a sonic boom woke all four of us. The boom repeated about 8 times. We ran to the edge of the forest to see what was happening, and from somewhere in the middle, a large round disk, about 300 yards away rose up and sped off in the opposite direction (south). The bottom of it was mezmerizing, like a light show. A large blue light in the center of it moved around in a spiral toward the outer edges and the object was outlined in a flashing changing color light. The next day, we followed one of our trails to where the object had been. What we founfd was unbelivable. A 40ft by 40ft area of the forest, in the shape of a circle, had no leaves at all. None were on the ground, and there were no plants. And all around the area lush greens leaves were everywhere. The trees were untouched, no branch was out of place. The end. P.S.

I was looking a set of three stars when two of them started moving in a uniform direction probably northwest from my position. My mother came outside and I pointed the two stars out to her and she noticed them too which reassured me that I wasn't trippin. We both deduced that it was too high to be a plane, i suggested that it might've been satellites but reasoned that they wouldn't probably be so bright that high up and two of them probably wouldn't be so close together moving in the same direction. As a matter of fact a real plane passed by and we both compared it to the plane and knew that definitely wasn't that because it didn't have any colored lights are anything blinking.

2 dark stealthy orbs silently cruised above Houston while rotating around each other;2012-01-01 23:00:00;Less then a minute;2 dark stealthy orbs silently cruised above Houston while rotating around each other Hello, Its 3 am and I haven’t been able to sleep because of the thing I saw.  I would not be wasting my time filing a report on this if I weren’t sure of what I experienced earlier.  It was strange and weird, and  I just want to let someone know.  I’m in total shock, its too ridiculous and bizarre! This occurred at Houston , Texas,  around 11 pm.   After driving my girlfriend home, and coming back home, I started to look up at the beautiful clear sky. The sky  here in Houston is never clear and you definitely never see so many stars as they were tonight. The beautiful  clear night sky and stars hypnotize my attention for a few seconds . That’s when I saw this/ these object (s). It seemed around 100 or so feet above the sky and it came the north heading south, it cruised over my head and in open space so I got a real great look at it! It seemed like two metallic or dark stealth looking orbs, its pretty crazy because the orbs did not give any light.  The way I saw them was from their shape and a sort of reflection that reflected of the surface of the objects. The objects seemed around 20 -30 feet in diameter and were 20  feet apart in a parallel horizontal way. I at first mistook the objects for a single plane who I thought did not have the lights on (I thought the orbs we! re giant light bulbs on the edge of the wing or something) but I notice the orbs were separated as starts could be seen trough the 20 foot gap between them. That’s when I was like woah, what could that be? I also did not hear any noise, complete silence , which kind of creeped me out. As the objects cruised away , I saw them rotate around each other in a circular pattern.  When I saw that I totally lost it and decided to look down. Thanks for hearing me out, had to tell someone.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
4 jets circling a mysterious object;2012-03-22 07:45:00;15 min+;4 jets circling a mysterious object Driving down 290 headed NW, I say 4 jets in the sky at the same time at certain points traveling in the same direction around a circular object that was stationary.   While I first thought it was a star, eventually it went away and then near the same location where a stationary line appeared that emitted a bright yellow light.  Eventually it got dark.  Could have been a star but the 4 jets in the sky at the same time seems suspicious to me.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Two sets of three round lighted aircraft objects;2012-09-20 20:00:00;ongoing;Two sets of three round lighted aircraft objects Sighting 09/20/12  There are two half circles of three lights each in Houston:  1.  Above the Transco/Williams Tower at Loop 610 West near Richmond/Alabama. 2.  Above the Post Oak/Uptown Area at Loop 610 West and Post Oak Blvd. Details on #1. I was standing on the east side of Transco/Williams Tower and looked up at the beacon light.  I noticed a very distinct object that wasn’t moving.  I looked again about ten minutes later and the object had progressed several feet eastward and that is when I noticed the pattern of three lights. Facing west, the three objects were positioned with the first light at the 18:00 position, the second light at the 15:00 position and the third light at the 12:00 position. Details on #2. While standing in the same location, I looked northward and noticed the second set of three objects.  These lights were positioned again in the same positions of 18:00, 15:00 and 12 noon. There appeared to be more than one light on each object, possibly red and white. My question is this are these US machines up there? Monitoring busy city areas? Or are these foreign machines up there monitoring US areas of interest? Are the UFOs and what are they monitoring?  Very strange. There were two of us that saw the same thing.

Large qrange/red circle appeares and disappears in the Houston sky.;2013-09-07 21:30:00;15 minutes;Large qrange/red circle appeares and disappears in the Houston sky We were at an outdoor concert in Houston, close to the medical center.  There were EMS helicopters flying all night and we were in a flight path for Hobby Airport.   A large orange/red circle/orb appeared in the sky, must have been (guessing) 4-5 miles away.  It was larger than any star or aircraft that were closer.  It seemed to float for several minutes and then got smaller like it was moving away from us and did this very quickly.   All of a sudden it was back in a different spot and did the same thing.  It appeared a third time but this time it moved up and down and then got smaller like it was moving away from us at a very rapid rate much faster than of the airplanes in the sky.

Small white ball over Houston.;2014-01-22 20:00:00;15 seconds;Small white ball over Houston. This object was observed while I was closing my gate in front of my home just outside of downtown, normally I gaze at the stars and this one star did stand out this time,  It was just of feeling that this star just didn't belong there.  Suddenly this star moves in an Z-Pattern and just disappears! I had to blink and do all sorts of things to make sure I was really seeing this.  Basically, this object looked more like solid light like planet,  it was just small bright circle disguised as a star/planet!;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Saw yellow-orange ember-like crafts move swiftly in a more or less-straight line right over my roof headed southwest past the row of houses. Moved fairly quickly.  Some grouped together while others trailed behind. At least twice the size of airplane lights at night. I had a close up view.  They were silent.  They kept coming, so I counted 22-plus.

Blue light in the sky appears and vanishes instantly.;2014-11-16 23:30:00;3 seconds;Blue light in the sky appears and vanishes instantly. I was with some friends hanging out in my truck just parked, we were talking about what we did that day when I heard a huge BANG noise.   At the same time that I heard the noise I saw a huge blue light in the shape of a circle.  It was as if it were an explosion, starting from the center, it expanded outwards and then back to the center.   All the lights in the street had turned off including my dashboard on the truck.  That's when I knew something was wrong.   I was in so much shock, I asked my friends if they saw it.  It was four of us and only one other had seen it along with me.  That's when I knew it wasn't a joke and what I saw was real.  It was far up in the sky which is why I know it had something to do with UFO's and wasn't anything caused by humans.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Houston, TX, sighting of strange lights and power/signal outage.;2016-10-02 04:30:00;10 minutes;Houston, TX, sighting of strange lights and power/signal outage At 4:30am this morning, Oct 2, 2016, in Houston, TX, all cable signal was lost in the house which has never happened.  Soon after cable signal was lost, so was all the power on the block (walked outside).   After walking outside to inspect outage, in a clear sky we spotted an aqua green, translucent object moving slowly from a round to oval shape (looked, compared to a jellyfish without tentacles and size as to holding a quarter at arm's width away from face), traveling at un-constant rate of speed and direction, without making a sound.   We watched for 30-45 seconds then made a hard left and shot quickly out of sight.   Minutes after witnessing this and discussing with others that saw it, seemed to be military helicopter moving at a high rate of speed in the same direction as the strange light.   After object was out of sight all power and signal returned to normal.   From being in shock we didn’t get any pictures or footage.   There were four others than me that witnessed this sighting. Interested in finding out if anyone in the area seen the same or anything comparable to what we saw.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

My husband and I were talking and were at a red light.  Suddenly we saw something fall from the sky and it looked like it curved down, like rolled down the sky.  Across the houston skyline.  It was not a shooting star and we both gasped and said- did you just see that?  It was a ball of light, that literally, fell from right, tumbling down two left. And then it was gone less than two seconds.  I just noticed the light, but my husband says it had a green tint.

Me, my mom, and dad witnessed 3 UFOs.  We were able to capture 1 on camera.  When I went to take a photo of it, It turned all of its lights off.  And I’m sure it wasn’t the clouds covering it. After I turned my phone off, it’s lights turned back on again.  The UFO was circular and was silver with a “black ring” within itself.  On video, the ufo itself is rotating and flying at a high rate of speed;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
