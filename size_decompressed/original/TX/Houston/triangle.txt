Object passed over, caused vehicle power failure and animal agitation;1985-06-11 22:30:00;40 min.;Object passed over, caused vehicle power failure and animal agitation At the time of the sighting experience I was working at a horse farm in Tx. The other person with me at the time of sighting was the trainer at the same farm. Myself and the other person were transporting a load of 6 horses from a farm in Houston to our base farm in Waco Tx at night.  Around 10:15 pm we pulled over to check the horses, water them ( it was a very warm night)  We opened up the side door of the transport and proceeded to tend to the horses. We were driving a semi tractor trailer type transport  A few minutes later we noticed the horse getting agitated, ears flicking back and forth, breathing heavier, stomping their hooves. The other person stepped out of the transport  to see if there was a coyote or something they caught scent of, he saw nothing.  The horses agitation increased  At around 10:30  my companion called me to come outside the trailer I did. He pointed up to the sky, northwest direction, I looked. There was a patch of the sky that was darker than the rest, and the stars were blocked out. It appeared to be moving towards us in a southeast direction At that time the semi started to run roughly, the lights started to dim all over it and inside the trailer. The horses were quite agitated at this point. The dark spot in the sky was now almost overhead and we were aware it was a triangle shape, and very large. In my estimation it was over 2 football fields long, or over the length of my outreached hand to the sky, I did that to try to judge the size. As it passed overhead there was no sound. It was definitely a solid object, had a appearence of metal, possibly stone, or another hard surface. And as it passed over  the semi tractor trailer ceased running,like the fuel wasn't getting to the engine and the lights faded  to going totally off. The horses were very nervous by this time. After approx. 10 minutes ( the object moved slowly) it had passed completely over us and was heading in the southeast direction still.  As it got farther away the semi tractor trailer started back up, the lights came back on, both gradually as if they were filling from being drained off or something. the horses settled as it got farther away as well. Both of us were shaken at this experience, and have never forgotten it to this day  We watched the object until it disappeared from decent view which was around 11pm  then closed up the trailer, and proceeded on our way to Waco. Neither of us have spoken or reported this until this past year. Only to the Coast to Coast radio website, and have told a few close friends.

Enormous triangular craft. No lights, no noise.;1985-08-15 21:30:00;1 minute;Enormous triangular craft. No lights, no noise. I was taking some classes at the University of Houston during the summer and there was a summer pool party at night. My room mate was telling my others friends a joke. I was bored and looked up and saw this enormous triangular shaped craft. I would estimate to lenght to have been 1/2 mile. It was totally black, had no lights and made no noise. I screamed Look, look. Only the girl sitting next to me looked up. I asked her What was it ?. She made a face of Idon't know and turned her back to me not wanting to discuss it. It has been 17 years now and I hope I will know what it was before I die.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Two witnesses observed triangular object made of hazy greenish lights speeding back and forth across the horizon.;1991-07-15 21:00:00;45 minutes;Two witnesses observed triangular object made of hazy greenish lights speeding back and forth across the horizon. It the summer of 1991, before my senior year of high school.  I lived in the suburbs northwest of the city of Houston, TX, which are near FM 1960 (not sure if the road is still called that).  Ambient light in the area was tolerable for skygazing, and there were no military bases in the area. One evening around 9pm CST, I had just come home from eating dinner at a restaurant with my mother.  She had observed an object in the sky after I had already gone inside the house.  She came in and said I should go look outside, that she had just saw something very strange.  At the time I was extremely skeptical of UFOs, but she is a very logically-minded person, and so I indulged her. By that time the object was already gone, but I decided to wait outside for a bit.  Around thirty or forty minutes later, as I was about decided to give up and go inside, I saw a triangle-shaped object rather high in the sky.  The object was comprised of about twenty greenish, hazy lights.  The whole surface of the object was rather nebulous in this fashion  there were distinct lights, but their coronas blended together to form a unified triangular object.  It was difficult to judge its distance or altitude from me, as the night was clear and there were no reference objects to compare against.  It had to be at least 5,000 feet in the air  it definitely had the appearance of having a high altitude.  It was probably a mile or two away from me on the x-axis.  Its size between my fingers while at arm's length (i was around 6'0 at the time) was about 1 inch long and about 3/4ths of an inch wide.  Since I was viewing it from an angle of probably 30 degrees from its side, and it had the shape of a slightly-distorted isosceles (two sides longer than the base) triangle, it was either flying at an angle, or its side was actually triangular. The object moved silently and smoothly across the horizon in a matter of five seconds, and because it appeared to be so high, I found it to be impossible to be a commercial plane or satellite.  And since in the over ten years I had lived in Houston up to that time I had never once seen a military jet fly over, I felt I could safely rule that out, especially given the lack of contrail and running lights.  I have seen military jets in flight though, and this seemed to travel at a speed far in excess of any military craft.  It also could not have been a spotlight since there was no cloud cover to reflect off of, and the pattern was not predictable as a spotlight would be. The object moved back and forth across the horizon about three times before disappearing. The shape of the object reversed when it came back into view travelling the opposite direction (i.e. the triangle was pointing the other direction). I had the distinct feeling that I was being watched or observed.  Given the highly skeptical nature of my mindset at the time about UFOs, I cannot readily attribute this to a sense of UFO expectation.  It was a very primal sensation that registered almost unconsciously.  I went in to discuss the sighting with my mother, and then she and I came out together to look for it, and we saw it once again briefly as it once again glided across the horizon.  Though I waited outside for some time, I did not see it again. As a sidenote, several months later the show Unsolved Mysteries ran a special on UFO sightings which my mother and I both happened to be watching on separate TVs.  Some amateur footage of this object was shown which matched exactly with what I saw.  We both independently confirmed this. Background of observer:  I consider myself fairly intelligent, educated and fair-minded.  I have a degree in Advertising from a well-respected university, and am a web designer.  My mother is also intelligent, educated and fairly conservative in making fanciful leaps.  She has a Masters degree and teaches.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

We were relaxing and talking and for some reason I looked up and said wow, look at the pink geese My aunt looked as well as my uncle and said thats not geese and kinda looked shocked, I then looked at my mom and said did you just see that hovering over us? She looked kind of scared. I asked my aunt what she thought it was and she had no idea just that it was large and very quiet gliding slowly over us. I looked at the local news that night and nobody else had reported it. I will never forget this... Several times while growing up in a suburb of Houston, called Rosenberg, I had witnessed several other craft both day and night. The reason I am writing this now is because I didnt know there was any plcae to report this. Thank you for letting me share our experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Stationary hourglass-shaped object that appeared to be made of glass;1997-04-23 19:30:00;20 minutes;Stationary hourglass-shaped object that appeared to be made of glass I stepped out onto the front porch of my house, which faced due east.  It was about 7:30PM and heavily overcast with a ceiling of about 1000 feet with a strange orange color to the clouds, which I assume came from the Low Pressure Sodium lighting around the city. I happened to glance up at about a 45 degree angle and noticed a very strange shaped object just sitting there, stationary in the sky just below the cloud ceiling.  It was two equilateral triangles, connected at the tips in the shape of an hour glass.  Your choices of descriptions of the object above didn't include hourglass shape.  I've always been interested in the subject of UFO's but hadn't seen one previously and so was immediately intrigued.  I watched it for about 10 minutes and noticed that it appeared to be two FLAT equiliateral triangles made of transparent glass which seemed to either reflect the clouds around it or project the clouds behind it, through the solid-appearing object.  I ran inside and got the phone to call the city desk at the local newspaper to report it and find out if anyone else had seen it.  They said that yes, others had seen it, about 8 calls had already come in.  The guy said someone surmised that it was some kind of reflection from a petrochemical flair at the ship channel.  True, the color of the object, a strange orangish color that was very similar to the surrounding clouds, was very similar to the color of the bright orange flairs I've seen at petrochemical plants.  However, clouds are constantly moving and changing shape and this object was not only stationary, but fixed in its shape with very sharp and straight edges so their explanation did not even come close to holding water!

Witnessed black, metallic UFO pass by airplane window at 28,000 feet.  Witnessed by several people in daylight.;1997-10-24 18:00:00;5-6  seconds;Summary : Witnessed black, metallic UFO pass by airplane window at 28,000 feet.  Witnessed by several people in daylight. Friday, 10/24/97 at approx. 6:00pm (Mountain Time).  Continental Airlines flight #1807 from Houston to Phoenix.  Shortly after takeoff witnessed a black, semi-matte, metallic craft fly right past the airplane through the window.  It was traveling east - opposite direction of the plane - and was visible as it flew past for about 6 seconds.  Size and distance from plane couldn't accurately be determined, but it was incredibly close to the plane. It had a triangular upper half, but the lower half was rounded and dome-shaped.  This occured at 28,000 feet (the pilot had announced the plane's altitude only minutes before.)  3 to 4 other people also witnessed the object as it flew by.  It was daylight and it was clear enough to see the object had definate edges and form (i.e. it wasn't just a dark shape seen out of the corner of the eye.) The observer has had past training in local law enforcement as well as some FBI training, and would not be described as a typical believer in such things as UFOs.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
see below;1999-11-18 01:20:00;15 seconds;see below I was watching for the Leonid meteors this morning. Between 1:15 A.M. and 1:20 A.M., I observed 3 pale orange lights in a perfect triangle. At first, I thought they were 3 meteors. I first noticed them just behind Orion's belt. They were moving at a constant rate of speed due west. They left NO tail. The formation DID NOT change shape in any form. At arm's length, there was about 1/2 inch between the lights. If they were at extreme altitude, at the speed they were moving, there should have been a sonic boom. At lower altitude, if an airplane, I would have heard the engine sound and didn't. I watched them for about 15 seconds until they faded from sight just south of the bright star about 40 degrees to the west of Orion. They moved this 40 degree distance in approximately 15 seconds. They were NOT meteors!!;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

While my daughter and I were observing the the Lunar eclipse we were surprise to see an unusual object flying high above and away from us. My daughter described seeing two bright lights side by side but I had the better view with my binoculars (7 x 35) and saw two triangular sets of lights side by side. The lights were amber and blue and making this even more odd was that there was no sound coming from the object. The object appeared to glide through the sky in a southeasterly path above the Clear-Lake area and then make a left-sideway motion towards the Johnson Space Center. Coincedentally, shortly after our experience I noticed two military jets (coming from the general direction of where I last saw the object) preparing to land at Ellington Air Field.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

As we passed under the object a third light was visible marking the points of an equilateral triangle. My girlfriend and I were driving to meet some friends and were travelling on 610-Southbound about five miles north of the Ship Channel Bridge. While I was driving my girlfriend looked up at the sky where she noticed two non-flashing white lights in front of us and a little to the west. As we continued driving southbound we noticed that the two lights were not moving at all and were too bright to be a plane. After about two minutes of driving southbound we began to move to a vantage point that was beneath the stationary object and noticed a third light completing an equilateral traingle on the underside of the object.  The lights remained perfectly round from the side (headlights) view as well as the underside view. The object produced no sound and held its position as we left it behind us.  Afterward, we noticed a large amount of air traffic in the Houston area.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I noticed a large bright shimmering light near the Transco Tower, as we watched it appeared to hover for 4-5 minutes, it then proceeded to move to my right, bank and come straight for our building. Once it got very close and made another right bank, we could see the underside through our window at the 1 o'clock position. We then could see it was a very large triangle. It was huge. What struck us as odd, was how it was just sitting there, and moved so slow in it's bank but was so large. It had four white lights one on each point and one in the middle, it had two smaller lights one red and one white on each side of the middle white light. Was also is odd it is passed very close to our building, and we didn't hear a rumble or anything. (Later a plane passed overhead and we could hear it clearly) Something of that size should have made a large rumble, especially banking as much as it was. It banked pass the window and leveled, and flew off in a southeast direction.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

We went out on our patio immediately and saw a triangular delta wing shaped object similar to Aurora fly over us at about 2000 feet. It was the size of large commercial jets that fly by. This craft however had no sound and seemed to glide by at least twice the speed of a commercial jet. It was silver and did not have any lights, it reflected light from the city.

The UFO was (isoceles) triangular in shape, a flat black in color, and had green pulsating lights in each corner. For the duration of the sighting, the object appeared to simply hover in one spot in the Houston sky. Because the oject was in the part of the sky that I, the driver, could not see, she was the only witness to it. She took her eyes off the object for the briefest moment and when she re-focused on the area in which she had seen it, it was gone. It appeared to have simply disappeared. My wife thought of every possible explanation for the object (helicopter, hang glider, etc) but nothing could explain its strangeness.

It moved slowly above the clouds and had a slight wobble as it moved I was on my way home from work, Thursday, March 17, 2005. I noticed in the sky @ 1/2 mile from my car a black triangular looking craft coming towards my car. I was on Westheimer close to the Highway 6 intersection in Houston, Texas. I continued to watch it from my car but as it passed my car, I decided to turn my car around and find a nearby parking lot to park at so that I could get out of my car and continue to observe this object. It was a little cloudy but only a little. This object didn't seem to be going very fast, though. What was strange to me besides the triangular shape is that it seemed to have a slight wobble to it as it flew towards my car. Also, while other planes and helicopters in the air had lights on, this craft did not have lights. It almost looked as though it was hiding in the clouds because it seemed to stay in the clouds as it moved and would occasionally come out of the clouds.

Tiangular  UFO Hovering In Houston's Night Sky;2006-05-12 00:00:00;1-2Min;Tiangular  UFO Hovering In Houston's Night Sky My name is ((name deleted)).  My fiancee'is ((name deleted)).Together on the night of May 12, 2006, at 11:30 pm I was driving on FM1960 heading east over the overpass at Hwy 59 North near the community of Kingwood. We are both in our 20s & were both sober & of sound mind at the time of the sighting. ((name deleted)) looked out the passenger window & asked What is that?.I looked over to my right(south) & saw the object as what I dimissed at first glance as a passenger plane,as the Bush Intercontinental Airport is in the NW area of Houston(south of our location).  ((fiancee)) then said But,it's not moving. I looked again & slowed the car to about 20mph & observed the craft was indeed perfectly still hovering over trees & a shopping center in the distance. We both observed that it's lights were forming a triangle(7 white lights at the points & along it's 3 edges with 1 large white pulsating light in the center on the bottom.The craft could easily be mistaken as a jumbo jet, but it's behavior indicated otherwise.  A few seconds after we noticed it hovering, it began to slowly accelerate S/W at low speed & at a perfect line without dipping or wavering as a plane would at low altitude.I completely stopped the car on the overpass with no other cars on the road ahead or behind.   As we watched the craft it then did something even more strange.  It stopped completely & hovered again without any motion or sound,as if it noticed us. We then proceeded down the road to pull over out of the road but it began to move S/W again over the trees which obstructed our sight.I made a U-turn in order to chase it & continued back over the bridge to the west.  Once back over we saw nothing in the sky. The only lights visible were from the traffic below on Hwy 59 & the tower lights on the freeway. This area is a high traffic area for planes & helicopters but after we saw the triangular UFO there was no more air traffic at all. The event lasted between 1-2 min. Strange but true.  I called the local 13 Eye Witness News Tip Line an hour later.  I was the only report at the time regarding this sighting.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Family has had several encounters over years with possible explanations regarding agenda, bovine blood use, and bdellium collection.;2008-01-04 19:00:00;30 minutes;Family has had several encounters over years with possible explanations regarding agenda, bovine blood use, and bdellium collection. You asked me on the phone why I waited so long to report my experiences to anyone.  In actuality I have shared my experiences with family members and friends for years, but not until recently did I think that anything that I had to share would be relevant or of any importance or interest to an official UFO investigative or reporting agency. In recent months there have been several televised reports: UFO Hunters, UFO Files, etc. on television that I have watched that have convinced me to pass on some information that may help.  I am not writing for any recognition or monetary gain.  However, I am willing to take any type of lie detector test, medical test that you or someone else may want me to submit to, in order to verify any information I am sharing with you now or in the future. 1.) I have been in the medical laboratory field just short of 20 years, so you will be able to appreciate my confusion while I was watching a report on cattle mutilations when a prominent doctor (omitted name per your instruction) said, I am not aware of that many similarities between bovine blood and human blood.  Either this is a doctor I would never want to go to or he was telling a boldfaced lie. In the laboratory there are several types of automated pieces of equipment to analyze everything from thyroid function to bacterial infections and STD’s.  All of these machines need to be calibrated with positive and negative controls, nearly ALL of which are made out of bovine blood, BECAUSE IT IS SO SIMILAR TO HUMAN BLOOD. While working for one of the top DNA and GENETICS companies in the US, nearly all of our research incorporated the use of bovine blood, because of the similarities. 2.)  During one of my dad’s encounters with, for lack of better words, the aliens, he asked them why they were here.  The answer he received was that they are here to harvest our planet’s abundant resource of bdellium and its anti-gravitional properties.  Do I know anything about bdellium?  I haven’t got a clue!  But that is the answer my dad got. He was also convinced that their being here was not a good thing for mankind.  He said they had cloaking abilities and that they could be standing right next to you, and you would never know. I had a first hand experience when I was in the backyard playing catch with a friend of mine.  We both saw a bird in mid flight hit what seemed like an invisible wall, make a loud thumping sound, and then it fell dead to the ground. 3.)  From watching one of the episodes of UFO Hunter, they had two men who tested with unusually high ck levels.  If you have any more information on that, I would appreciate receiving it.  I am currently on full disability.  I have had cancer four times and am now struggling with a rare endocrine disease, similar to Addison’s, but I am not responding well to treatment. At some point in my youth I received a straight incision on my backside that I have memories of receiving while surrounded by many “beings”.  My dad was there.  My mother was not and when I have asked her questions regarding what it is and why I have it, she has no recollection of me ever having an injury there. At the very least, my body seems unusually prone to sickness. I have had several encounters over the years, starting with seeing something in the park on my 8th birthday.  My brothers and I saw a glowing ball of light hovering in front of the screen door while my parents were in Pittsburgh. My older brother was watching us and we were terrified.  All clocks in the house stopped. We moved from Pa. to Ohio, and things continued.  My mom and I were out taking a summer drive and just talking when we saw something flying over us.  It went very fast and kept making abrupt changes in direction.  We looked for a road to turn around on and when we turned into a drive to do that we were stopped by what looked like military guards that ordered us to stop and get out of there.  My mom explained that was exactly what she had intended to do anyway. As recently as this year I watched a very large whatever go over the house here in Tx.  It wasn't like you could see it.  It blocked out things as it went overhead.  It was totally dark and totally quiet. There are many more encounters that I could share, but it is not these little incidents that matter.  What I felt I needed to share was the info on the bdellium and the bovine blood.  If it helps, I am glad.  Do I believe we are being visited? Yes.  Do I believe we should trust them? No. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Three triangular forms move quickly and in sync before disappearing, planes seemingly chasing it!;2008-01-11 21:00:00;4-5 seconds;Three triangular forms move quickly and in sync before disappearing, planes seemingly chasing it! I believe I have had a UFO sighting on this date, Friday, January 11, 2008, at approximately 9:00pm.  I was outside with my brother playing Frisbee golf while we walked his dog.  As he was explaining the basis of the next hole and I couldn’t pay attention to his words all I could do was look at the sky.  Normally in the city you’re lucky to see a handful of stars and the only constellation you can ever count on is Orion’s belt.  Tonight though, outside of my brother’s apartment, I couldn’t help but stare at the sky in amazement. I don’t know if it was the clear sky or my brother’s neighborhood but the sheer magnitude and number of stars was breathtaking.  As I was scanning the sky I noticed the odd triangular shaped light forms.  They were moving quickly, faster than the planes.  They were so low and clear and as I tried to keep my eyes on them they jetted through the sky and disappeared. The whole time I kept shouting at my brother to look at them but they were moving so fast that he was never able to fix his eyes on them.  The three lights just totally disappeared.  I ran down the block looking for them, but they were gone.  I stayed outside scanning the sky for ten minutes after, looking for the lights or anything that I might have mistaken this spectacle to be.  I can’t think of any other explanation for it. It was three triangular light forms, flying in formation.  They hovered for a tiny bit, which is when I spotted them.  Intrigued and confused by what I saw, my eyes followed the shaped as they sped through the sky.  I tried to absorb as much as I could about them before they disappeared.  Each triangular formation was actually composed of smaller lights creating the triangular form.  They moved together perfectly and quickly and I know they weren't planes because I could see planes moving in the vicinity.  It almost seemed like they were chasing the formation it was amazing.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Strange object over Houston, Texas (midtown) on June 18, 2009;2009-06-18 22:00:00;1 minute;Strange object over Houston, Texas (midtown) on June 18, 2009 At roughly 10:00PM last night I stepped out onto my 3rd story balcony to have a cigarette.  I happened to look up into the sky as I usually do and noticed an odd shaped object moving from South to North at a fast pace. I wouldn’t be able to give an actual figure as far as it’s height off of the ground mostly because it was a densely dark object. One thing that intrigued me is that it was running silent and had no blinking lights whatsoever. Also, due to the fact that it was dark, it was fairly invisible in the night sky. The only reason I was able to notice it and distinguish its shape (fairly triangular) was because it flew just under some glowing night-time clouds. It flew right through a known air traffic lane. So soon after it passed the clouds it became invisible once more and then a passenger aircraft flew through the same airspace at approximately the same altitude, which allowed me to guess its size as roughly that of a large truck. It all happened very fast.  It was a partly cloudy night, so had it not been for the small cloud it passed under I would guess that I wouldn’t have noticed it at all.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Five Triangular shaped spacecraft seen over Memorial Park @ 8:30 pm Labor Day 9/06/10.;2010-09-06 20:30:00;10-15 minutes;Five Triangular shaped spacecraft seen over Memorial Park @ 8:30 pm Labor Day 9/06/10. Driving through Memorial Park, coming home from my son's house after Labor Day, I looked up to see a huge triangular shaped object with various colored lights underneath. It was stationary.  I said to myself, What is that?...It must be some kind of light for one of the playing fields out in the park...but where is the pole to hold it up?   There was no pole.  As I looked closer I said, That cannot be a UFO this close to downtown Houston!  I was within about 3 miles of downtown.  The craft was facing downtown, which is east of the park.  Actually, they were pointing east southeast.  I was about the length of a city block inside the 610 Loop on Memorial.  They should have been visible from Loop 610 as well. A few other cars drove by, but none seemed to look up or notice them at all!  I looked around to see if the other cars were weaving or pulling over or pointing out the window.  (And no, I do not drink alcohol. I was totally sober, no drugs, either.)   I saw airplanes casually flying above all five of these UFOs and they were commercial craft...on their way to Hobby Airport.  This is how I knew the UFOs were pretty low in the sky.  The one nearest me was gigantic.  It was big enough that if I extended my arm full length from my body and held the hand flat, it would not have covered the craft completely!  I was on Memorial Drive, and there are no shoulders, but there was an unused left-turn cut out, (unused because it was night time and that part of the park was closed).  I pulled in there, cut the engine, and got out my cell phone to take a photo.  I noticed there were four others above the one larger one, therefore they looked smaller, but they were the same type of craft.  They were all facing downtown Houston, and seemed to be in formation. I rolled down my window to take a photo, and when that was done, the big one was gone.  I felt quite dizzy. I looked through my windshield and the big one had moved laterally to my right.  I felt confused, and then said aloud, Oh, they do not want their picture taken. I sat there a minute, then I said, Well, there is nothing to be done here.  And I drove home. When I got home, I sat down and watched TV and then went to bed.  It was not until later the next day I called anyone to tell them what I had seen, though I posted it on FB asking if anyone else had seen five large UFOs over Memorial Park the night before.  No response. About a month or two later, I called my friend, ((female name deleted)), and told her what happened.  I commented that it was so odd that I just went home and didn't tell anyone at first.  I never called the media or the police.  It just didn't occur to me. Niara is an abductee herself, has written about this kind of thing for the Durango Examiner, and she offered to hyphotize me (over the phone) to see what we could find out...if there were more that I was not remembering. So we scheduled something, and she took me into a light trance. There was more that I had not remembered, of course.  I was sucked up out of the car  window and taken away for 28 days, and then returned to my car a few seconds later. (They can traverse/manipulate time, apparently.) I got to see what they looked like. I was taken to another planet. If you believe me and want to learn more, contact me. If you do not believe me, I could not care less.  My intent for reporting this is doing a public service.  I do NOT want any publicity, please. I will talk if you want to contact me.  I can answer more questions.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I saw 3 softly glowing, unblinking orange lights in a triangle formation as it flew without a sound by quickly.;2011-08-12 22:00:00;5-6 seconds;I saw 3 softly glowing, unblinking orange lights in a triangle formation as it flew without a sound by quickly. I was watering the backyard plants at around 10:00pm.  The clouds seemed odd because they seem to move faster at night.   I glanced up at them often.I noticed something moving in the corner of my eye and saw it.  It was 3 soft glowing orange lights which formed a triangle.  I couldn't see it clearly as it was behind thin clouds.   It moved fast and silently due west.  The size could've been anything because I didn't know its altitude.   I barely noticed it and I don't think anyone else in the neighborhood noticed it.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Four silent triangular shaped UFOs spotted flying in formation over central Houston.;2014-03-29 01:00:00;5 seconds;Four silent triangular shaped UFOs spotted flying in formation over central Houston. While looking up into the night sky, I spotted 4 triangular aircraft moving across the Houston sky.  They were flying in a V shaped missing man formation. The craft were moving fairly fast in a straight line and at a consistent speed.  They were silent and no lights were observed.  The underside of the craft were illuminated by the night light pollution from the city. Altitude estimation 5-10K feet.  Cruising speed unknown, but moving much faster than typical commercial aircraft on approach to Hobby Airport. The craft were black, with a metallic underside - hence the reflection from the city lights. Due to my limited field of vision, I only had a short window to observe (5 seconds). I am a Houston resident.  A professional with a lot of experience flying/traveling and observing aircraft. Unfortunately no pictures/videos were taken.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
I saw a black triangular object for 3 seconds pass behind a small cloud never to re-appear.;2014-08-28 19:55:00;3 seconds;I saw a black triangular object for 3 seconds pass behind a small cloud never to reappear I was playing basketball with  my son on our driveway, back by the garage, at around 7:55 pm, when my attention caught this black triangular object in the southern sky, not overhead and not on the horizon, but in the middle but more overhead.   I saw the black triangular object with three lights at each point for no longer than 3 seconds.  It was rather large, perhaps the size of the moon and  a small cloud was in its path.  It passed behind the small cloud, and I could see the lights become covered by the small cloud, but when I expected the object to reappear after passing over the small cloud, it did not reappear.   Also, the vector movement of the triangular object  in a straight line was not related to one point moving forward or one side moving forward.  When the object disappeared, I also noticed that the small cloud developed and became somewhat thicker.  There was no opportunity to visually record the event as it happened so quickly.   I have never witnessed any thing like this before.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

We were driving home, and someone noticed a bright, red light in the sky.  After a few seconds, we all saw it.  It was a bright, red circle of light, with what looked like a triangle on the front.  It moved from north to south.   It was first spotted about 60 degrees up, towards south.  It then continued to move across the sky in a southwardly direction for about five minutes, until it reached about 30 degrees up.   It then disappeared, during the time it took to get from the front of the house to the back (we got home right before it disappeared).   It looked something a little like this:  O>…  i.e., a red circle, with a triangle on the front.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I have never before seen anything in the sky that looked strange, but I saw a V or triangle shaped greyish object with no sound or lights against a dark sky gliding pretty fast north to south, then turning southeast when directly over me.  It flew perfectly smoothly and was headed in the general direction of downtown Houston or Ellington Air Force Base about 25 miles away.  Its form was static like a plane and seemed to be gliding at a few hundred feet, or perhaps flying too high to hear.  At age 70 this was a first for me - I don't believe in extra-terrestial UFOs, but this was truly amazing to see.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
