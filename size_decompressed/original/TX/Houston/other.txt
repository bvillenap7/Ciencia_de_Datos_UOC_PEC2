I was traveling on a Sun night from Houston, TX on my way back to Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, TX. It was around 9 or 10pm. If you'd like to verify my memory,Texas was in the middle of a severe drought that summer of 1980. I saw miles and miles of dead cornfields. Suddenly, something caught my attention at my 3 o'clock vision field.I saw what appeared to be 2 satellites on a dual trajectory. My 1st thought was It's a high flying jet .. but after a moment or two, I decided it was travelling way too fast.I did not see any other flashing strobe lights. I was amazed to see 2 satellites in tandem for the fist time. After watching this for a good minute, any doubts I had about it being an airplane evaporated. Suddenly,the 2 lights stopped in their trajectory tracks. After 4 or 5 seconds, the lights 'went out'...they disappeared simultaneously. The next morning, I asked the cadre instructors If a! nyone had heard about a UFO sighted over I 10 last night? They said No. All I can say folks is this: I KNOW what I saw...but I still do not know what it was.  Thanks for listening.

I awoke to find a Grey crawling on my bed.;1989-06-12 22:30:00;3 seconds;I awoke to find a Grey crawling on my bed. I was awakened by something crawling on our waterbed, causing waves, and found what I later learned was a Grey on the foot of the bed.  It was looking straight at me, leaning on its right hand, its left hand (four fingers) stretched out towards me.  It looked to be about four feet in height with long, lean fingers and big, black, bulging eyes, two tiny slits for a nose and a small slit for a mouth. Its head was larger in the cranium, the neck spindly.  I could tell it was reading my mind and since I was pregnant, I was really afraid.  I immediately screamed and jumped out of bed, running into the living room where my husband was watching television.  I've not seen another one of those since.  Incidentally, we were living about ten miles away from the Johnson Space Center. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Large Bus sized cloud - emanating several beautiful colors from center but not making it past outer edge of the cloud 2 minute sighting;1997-04-01 04:00:00;1-2 minutes;Large Bus sized cloud - emanating several beautiful colors from center but not making it past outer edge of the cloud 2 minute sighting My sighting was a night of a perfectly clear night, except one small cloud (size of a city bus). This cloud was about as high as a high rise, floating about 20 M.P.H. or so. Lights of several colors (beautiful reds, greens, blues and others) were emanating from center but not leaving the outer edge of the cloud. After viewing it for over a minute (over my left shoulder), I took my eyes off of it to execute a freeway change (I was traveling North on Loop 610 on West side of Houston, fixing to exit and travel South on Hwy 59) 30 sec. or so I resumed to observe it. The cloud was nowhere to be seen! I was riding a motorcycle at the time and had 360 degree view of my surroundings. I later saw an interview with the actor Sinbad. He stated that when he was a boy, he saw the same thing over a neighbors house hovering...Him being 35 yrs old or more at the time and me seeing mine within the last year(at the time) I figure this model hasn't changed for approx. 30 years! Thinking back, it may have been ours, a balloon with a projection of a cloud made around it (explaining the lights I saw). But it was a brightly moonlit night (I could tell that it was only cloud in area). How did it leave area so fast, there was no sign of it? Did we have that technology 30 years previous and the public still has been yet to have been enlightened? Please send me any information of this type of craft...mine and Sinbad's are the only two that I know of. It is driving me crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Recalled childhood experience;1998-07-21 21:00:00;15 minutes;Recalled childhood experience In the summer of 1998 my family and I were visiting an aunt in Texas. We were on our way to San Antonio and pulled over on the side of the road to check one of the tires.  I caught a strong cinnamon smell that brought back dormant memories of an experience I had back in El Salvador in 1969.  I was eight years old and El Salvador was at war with Honduras which was a neighboring country.  There was a nightly curfew and my older brother (10) and I used to sneak out of the house and go across the street to an open field to watch the lightning from the bombs in the far distance.  My brother went back to the house for a minute.   I felt something grab my ankles and lift me up to the sky.  As I looked up, I saw what looked like a huge bubble with a bright blue light inside.  I still remembered as the blood rushed to my head.  It felt like a long time that I was hanging upside down.   Next I found myself inside this bubble sitting in a chair and looking down.  I felt someone's hands on my shoulders but could not see anyone.  Someone sort of holding me down.  I also heard what sounded like dolphins chirping.   The bubble moved around the neighborhood for a while.  I could see my brother was outside again with my grandfather looking for me. They called for me and I could hear them.  They could not hear me.  I must have been about a hundred feet above them.  Finally the bubble came down near the same field and I fell out on my stomach.  My brother and grandfather heard me crying and eventually found me.  I have never told them this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  This report has many of the hallmarks which we traditionally associate with a serious report, although we are confused why he indicates that the event took place in both Texas and El Salvador.

I happened to look up in the sky and saw what looked like a really thin ribbon floating sideways through heading South.  I ran inside and told my brother to come outside also, and he saw it too.  It was a silver color, and I could not tell how high it was.  It could have been from 100 ft. to up in space.  The sky behind it was black, with few stars because of pollution.

Crescent Shaped Object;2003-09-25 22:20:00;6-8 SECONDS;Crescent Shaped Object West side of Houston, near the corne of Gessner and Westheimer.  I noticed a bright light that flickered on the surrounding cars aad drugsore parking lot, and immediately looked up.  It was a quarter moon shaped object with the horns either pointing upwards or to the west (hard to tell vertical/horizontal orientation at night).  The object was a brilliantly lit white, with two slighlty darker spots about 1/3 the way in from each end.  The lighting remiscent of the glow of a neon light.  It traveled from south/southeast to north/northwest, at a very high rate of speed, which I would estimate to be 2 times that of an airliner, maybe 600-650 mph.  It must have been low in the sky, because I first notice that it lit up the parking lot somewhat, however, it was above the low clouds as I saw it disappear behing a cloud it did not re-emerge.  No sound at all.  Direction appeared to be a straight line.  I've seen plenty of meteors and other objects in the sky before, but I was always able to satisfy myself that they were normal occurrences.  This was not a normal aerial object.  I also surprised myself with the amount of detail that I was able to recall from such a brief sighting.  No tail or trail.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I was walking out to the end of the street to get on the middle school bus, when I noticed a strange cloud above one of the houses. It was about as high as a storm cloud, but fairly small. It stood out to me because of it's brightness like the sun was right behind it (it couldn't have been because it was barely rising.) So right when I was about to turn around to grab our digital camera, and it dissapeared like when you blow on a car window. So I stared at the spot it was for a minute, and it reappeared for 5 seconds.

I saw it on Friday, the 6th of January I was on I-610 Loop west heading south in Houston and I saw this in the southwestern sky, just about the exact same angle as the pictures. Between 5:00pm and 6:00pm. This was Friday evening, the 6th, not on the 10th! I observed it for over 45 minutes, as I was caught in traffic heading the same direction the whole time. I even called someone from the car to go outside their house and look for it. If it was a plane, how did it stay in basicly the same place for 45 minutes. I was stuck in traffic and after I arrived at my friends house, we went inside and then left about 30 minutes later and it was still there except appeared to be farther away and a little lower in the sky. That made it still visible for over one and a half hours. That's not a plane. It is strange that my friend and I saw it on Friday night the 6th. If I had taken a picture while I was in traffic, it would have looked exactly like your photographs except when I first started noticing it the tails appeared to be in a slight V, not quite paralell. It kinda reminded me of the Hale-Bopp comet. I wish I had had my camera with me. It was not Venus! And stayed in view too long to be a plane. Even if it was on a long high route, I don't think that it would still be visible for 90 minutes!;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

On Thursday, June 23rd 2005 at approx;2005-06-23 18:45:00;50 seconds;I live in Sharsptown, a residential community located in the southwestern side of Houston, Texas. On Thursday, June 23rd 2005 at approximately 6:45 pm I noticed a very bright object in the southern sky traveling north to northwest at a very high rate of speed. I normally do not look up at the sky, but a pretty red cardinal caught my attention as it perched on a telephone wire in my backyard. I was wading in the swimming pool at the time and as I watched this bird I noticed a very tiny round or ball shaped object that looked like a typical star in illumination, but not as distinct because it was still daylight. The object was very tiny to the naked eye—no larger than the head of a shirt pin. Owing to its size, I presumed the object to be flying at a very high altitude—much higher than typical passenger jets that fly at 35,000 feet. The speed of the object I judged to be three to four times faster than passenger jets flying at this altitude. Usually when a passenger jet flies overhead at 35,000 feet or more you can watch them for a couple of minutes before they move out of your visual range. In the first twenty seconds I watched this object I believed it would move out of my visual range in less than one minute. At thirty seconds it changed to a westerly still maintaining its velocity and illumination which did not change. I lost sight of the object after 50 seconds as it faded into the brightness of the sun in the western sky.  I experience a similar even in 1965 when I saw a similar object while living in the City of Orange near Santa Ana in southern California. This event was reported in The Register newspaper. At the time my father, a West Point graduate, was a lead aerospace engineer at North American working on Gemini space vehicle projects for NASA.  I cannot say for certain what I saw over Houston, but as an ex military man I trust my instincts and whatever this objects was—it flew at a speed in excess on MACH I perhaps even MACH II.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
I-10 & Cambell Road, Houston TX UFO Sighting;2007-01-03 18:30:00;3-5min;I-10 & Cambell Road, Houston TX UFO Sighting I was on Interstate 10 near Cambell Road at about 6:30 in the evening after work in heavy traffic. From the North-West, I noticed a bright white light in the distance. I thought it odd, because the light was much brighter than one would expect for an airplane. I kept watching the light aproaching while slowly moving through traffic.  It seemed to be moving slowly and on a level path to go directly over the Interstate. As it aproached I noticed it was more than one light. It apeared to be 5-6 lights in a row and the were pulsing in a left to right pattern.  At this time I looked around to see if anyone else was observing and several drivers around me were also looking in that direction and pointing, to show their passengers the lights. By now it was getting fairly close to where I was located and I could make out more definition of the lights.  The lights apeared to be circulating around whatever object was. I could not definately make out a shape, due to the highway lights and the orientation of the object to my vehicle. The lights were not only white, but seemed to posess an irridecent color shifting quality, with different hues of red, blue and possibly yellow.  As the craft passed over, and behind my car, I rolled down the window to see if I could identify what it was. Unfortunately, the angle of the crafts travel took it at an akward angle that I could not see, due to the fact that I was still trying to drive and watch traffic.  I did not notice any sound, though there may have been. With many cars around me traffic possibly would have drown out any noise the craft was making.  I am not sure what I saw, but it was unlike anything I had seen in the past. I am interested in finding out if anyone esle present on the interstate that evening will report it here.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Two connected and cloaked elongated circles;2007-11-26 19:00:00;:40 SEC;Two connected and cloaked elongated circles The object was moving Northwest to Southwest at an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet and at a speed of probably around 700 or 800 mph.   The object was unusually shaped.  It had two visible wings that seemed to be cloaked with the background of the absolutely clear night sky.  They were shaped like elongated circles possibly at a span of several hundred feet.  The middle of the craft was seen as only a spec of light.   These wings did were not fixed in a uniform position.  One appeared to be angled at about 30 degrees to the back and the other wing was pretty much 90 degrees straight out.  As the craft moved through the sky, I could notice the wings shifting slightly but no drastic shift.   One strange thing was that I saw this craft only 30 minutes after the sun went completely down.  Something that high up should have refracted some of the Sun's light but this did not which is why I say it was in some sort of cloaked mode.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

We both watched as this black thing just hovered across the sky at the same speed for at least 5 minutes before the object started rising very slowly.  We knew it wasn't a bird because nothing on it moved..no wings or anything.  We watched this thing for at least 15 minutes before it went so high in the sky that it just disappeared.

Witnessed white floating object hovering and spinning slowly in the sky in Houston, Texas.;2008-09-30 13:00:00;3-4 minutes;Witnessed white floating object hovering and spinning slowly in the sky in Houston, Texas. I am an elementary school teacher.  While on the playground during recess, a student spotted a white object hovering approximately 1000-1500 feet in the air.  The object appeared to be white with two large spheres on one side and what appeared to be an elongated cylinder on the other side.  It was almost triangular, but it was two spheres and a flat, cylindrical shape.  We thought it was possibly a weather balloon at first, but it was rotating at a constant speed and height as it moved slowly across the sky.  It seemed to be almost scanning the ground.  I also thought it could be some type of flying camera taking pictures of the area after Hurricane Ike or for some type of internet earth map because it maintained the same speed and altitude. The object was near the descent pattern for Houston Intercontinental Airport, but it was too slow and was obviously not an airplane, helicopter, or blimp.  The object made no sound as it moved across the sky.  I wanted to go inside and get my camera, but I didn't want to alarm any of the other students.  I also thought the object would be out of view by the time I returned from my classroom.  Only a small crowd gathered to watch the object as the other students played on the playground.  I am skeptical of stories I have read about UFOs, but I did witness an object that is unidentifiable.  Please let me know if there is a logical explanation.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Multiple UFO Sightings Houston, Texas;2009-01-15 18:10:00;about an hour.;Multiple UFO Sightings Houston, Texas I was sitting outside with a friend when we notice a police helicopter circling around us (it continued to do so for about 10min.) Then we saw a triangular craft with a bright white light in the middle with smaller lights throughout the craft. I could pefectly see the shape of it. It was moving slowly and ackwardly and moved out of sight. Then we saw what was the shape of a twin rotor army helicopter, but it was making a low drone noise and had two very bright red lights. When one light blinked the other would go out and visa versa. On this one, it could just have been an army helicopter. But, the lights were really strong...not the normal airplane/helicopter light. Either way, why would there just be one flying relatively low to the ground? Then 10-20min. later we saw another triangular craft like the one before, but it soon disappeared. And about 5min. after that we saw the strangest thing yet. A group of blinking lights that were blinking really excitedly. Going from dim to dark as they blinked. And it would jump from one place to another and make really weird flight patterns. Sometimes it would go dim and then go really bright and go up and down really fast and then appear somewhere else. (I have a short video of it where you can see it jump, but at this point the ship had stopped blinking. Where do I send the video?) Then it started turning left then right in a smooth zig zag type of pattern. It seemed to have a shape while it was turning, but it's hard to explain the shape. I'd say it's closest to the chevronsign. We also saw a bright white orbish object flying around it for a little bit. Then it started moving back and forth, then disappeared. It's been a crazy night.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I began to notice one bright red light that appeared to be hovering about 3 miles away and approximately a quarter mile off the ground. I stopped looking at it until my friend pointed it out to me which made me inspect it more closely. It appeared at first to be a bright red football shaped light  hovering in one spot but by its light I could see a matte black object in the shape of a large oddly shaped airplane. From the point I had first noticed until we both started inspecting it maybe 5 minutes had elapsed with this object which appeared to be at least 50 feet long and wide hovering in one place but as soon as we both looked closer it appeared to get dimmer until we realized it was because it had left at such an amazing speed that the bright light just appeared to get dimmer. it took off at a 30 degree angle headed directly away from us and up into a completely clear sky until it disappeared from distance.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Crescent Shaped UFO Passes over Houston November 2011;2011-11-27 20:00:00;20-30 sec;Crescent Shaped UFO Passes over Houston November 2011 My sister and I were standing in front of our home talking, suddenly I heard a low flying jet pass over our home and immediately looked up at the sky.  The sky was completely clear with many aircraft circling, but, I immediately noticed an extremely large crescent -shaped object flying at what appeared to be a much higher altitude then the known aircraft. In comparison this craft was approximately 1.5-2 inches across, at least 4 times larger than any other discernible aircraft in the sky.  The object was emitting absolutely no light or sound, and at several points it appeared that areas of the craft appeared to vanish then reappeared.   At one point, there appeared to be a very low intensity blue light that pulsed from the center of the craft and radiated out towards the tips of the wings. In effect it was as if the light was internal with-in the craft, but, the craft was covered in a smoked glass allowing it to emit and be seen.  The craft appeared to be almost! the color of the sky, similar to a dark-cloud coloration, possibly a light blue, gray or silver hue, but barely discernible from the color of the sky at the time.  The speed at which the object traveled across the sky was at a much higher rate than any of the know aircraft in the sky.  It was traveling from the west-southwest of Houston toward the east-northeast.   Neither myself, nor my sister have ever seen a craft such as this, nor have any idea of what exactly it was.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
I saw 2 unidentified objects flying at night .;2012-08-17 23:20:00;2 minutes;I saw 2 unidentified objects flying at night . I was driving North, on Montrose Boulevard, at approximately 23:20 PM . I crossed the insercetion at Westheimer , and my attention was drawn to the lights , of an incoming aircraft.  The plane's flight path was from the West of Motrose heading roughly Southeast on a Glide Path, for Hobby Airport Houston , Texas, as it's most likely destination. I was watching the inbound aircaft, which I estimate was at an altitude of around 4 or 5 thousand feet, I noticed 2 more objects flying , in parallel formation to eachother , in a direction of South to North , just West of Montrose.  They were at an estimated altitude of 10 to 15 thousand feet.  The night was partly cloudy and the stars were very visible in the background.  The objects were much larger than any star or planetary obect in the background, but far smaller than a full moon. I fairly certain on my estimations of distance and altitude.  The size noted, was maybe 1/20th the diameter of a normal full moon. One aircraft, the most easterly of the 2 , was slightly in the lead. The objects were not moving at an exceptional rate of speed.  They were steady in flight characteristics, on a straight and level flight path. Both were uniform in color, though , the color observed , was a dull reddish orange glow, pointing perpendicular to the ground. The colors and round shape of the orange glow, reminded me of the shape and color of after-burners on a jet, but not as intense. There was a dull outer ring of orange next ring was darker and center of object again a dull orange. It is possible , these were a type of vertical lift for the propulsion system of the aircraft. As I observed the objects maintain a consistent and steady flight path, the trailing object began to slow fade to black.  This did not take more than a few second.  The leading object followed in this fade to black procedure.  At that point neither object could be observed in the sky.  At no point did I ever note any lighting consistent with Civilian or Military Aircraft.  I do note that the area the objects began to fade in was clear of clouds, stars were visible, and was maybe a mile or 2 away , as the bird flies.  The entire episode did not last more than a couple of minutes . ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he struck us as being quite level-headed and objective in his description of his sighting.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.

orange globe, closup;2013-03-01 20:01:00;4 minutes;orange globe, closup saw a very intense orange ball, traveling almost exactly north to south. was an orange ball, and as it traveled by me, it came into focus at approx 15 degrees until approx 240 degrees. during that period it became a box.  looked as a fish tank, the edges hightlighted.  inside the box, was a teardrop shape same brilliant orange color.  when i first relayed to my family, i said it was a teardrop.  but it comes in my dreams every few days, and what i get from the dreams is, the leading edge of the teardrop was sculptured.  two curved edges on leading edge, and at the top of teardrop, a harder image,  but never see it clearly.  the woman across the street owns a janitorial service, and after it past the point when it was clear to me, they arrived, i called to them to look. she said she saw an orange orb, and told me several of her employees saw it too. also, my son's house, where i was in the driveway, is on the outbound path from houston intercontinental airport! , and there was a plane at approx 30 deg in the background.  if you want further info, i would be happy to provide a rough sketch, and further info..as for distance, i am old, but with thumd fully extended, approx, 1 1/2 the size of my thumb.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Four aircraft circle like vultures then shoot off at great speeds.;2014-07-30 12:00:00;5 minutes;Four aircraft circle like vultures then shoot off at great speeds I was watching a plane dump out a chemtrail when I noticed what looked like four vultures very high up in the sky.  They were at the very least 4000 ft in the air, yet their shape was quite visible, and unusually large.   They made unusually quick circles for several minutes, then I finally decided to try and film them with my iPhone and as if it was scripted I kid you not they stopped circling and shot off at an insanely fast speed, one by one.   Of course the noon sun made it impossible to capture via the iPhone 5s, but my eyes (shaded by raybans) saw everything in 20/20 vision.  I wouldn't waste our time with a fairy tale, this was a unique event.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

First noticed a blue-green light in the sky.;2017-05-04 20:25:00;2:00;Was standing outside in downtown houston at 8:25pm right before sunset on May 4, 2017. First noticed a blue-green light in the sky.  Small about the size of a pin point.  I thought it was a commercial plan but then it moved fast and then just stopped in the sky.  I saw the other end of it and it was fire orange like some type of vent.  It at times moved in the direction the vent was pointing.  Oposite of what normal craft do.  This object moved so smoothly across the sky at fast speeds, slowing down, stopping, changing direction and angle effortlessly.  It was taller from top to bottom than it was wide, no wings.  The best was to describe is it was like a fly just smoothly making all the changes in flight pattern.  I saw a commercial air craft in between me and it and could judge distances from sizes of plane and it.  Hair stood up on my neck and I was very scared for the first min when I realized this is not normal and nothing I have ever seen before.  And then a peaceful calm came over me and I just took in what I was seeing for next 30 sec.  I did not have my phone on me and did not want to leave to go get it.  For a second, I looked next to me to see if anyone else saw I looked back and it was completely gone except for some shiny particles specs of light that disappeared also in a second.  Amazing....!!!!!!!;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Good evening. At about 7:28 PM, I was driving on US 90/ Main St. from the Stafford area, driving North East direction towards NRG Stadi;2019-10-04 19:28:00;2 seconds;Good evening. At about 7:28 PM, I was driving on US 90/ Main St. from the Stafford area, driving North East direction towards NRG Stadium area. Driving on US 90/Main st., I was approaching my exit (Hillcroft St.).  There was light rain which started at this time. Lightning flashed through the sky, North East, visually right in the sky in front of me. Before approaching the lane to exist from US 90/Main St. towards the North East direction towards Hillcroft St., the lit up sky (from the lightning) revealed a bright sky, as well as a miles wide Unidentified Aerial Phenomena /UFO hovering still seemingly over the NRG Stadium/Downtown area.  It was close to the ground. For perspective for distances / sizes:  When we see a commercial plane flying above the clothes, it looks like a small centimeter from our visual perspective on the ground typically. And we can visually see that the plane is flying through and over the clouds.  This UAP/UFO was visually hovering within the clouds directly above the NRG Stadium/Downtown area, visually being miles wide in length.  I cannot assume the exact miles but it looked like it covered at least 3 miles in length.  This object was clearly and precisely shown and revealed as the lightning lit up the sky behind the object, therefore revealing the object hovering directly in front of the light in my view.  This object was grey/black in color, perfectly shaded except for the, kind of transparent, clouds hovering around it.  This object was perfectly shaped as a short top hat. The UAP/UFO looked to be several cruise ships wide.  It was in my sight for about 2 seconds.  There was a blueish/grey haze around the object, but I'm not sure what it was coming from.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
