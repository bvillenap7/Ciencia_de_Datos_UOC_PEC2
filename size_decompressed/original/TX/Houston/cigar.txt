Sliver of light crashes in North Houston;2001-09-29 20:10:00;3-5 seconds;Sliver of light crashes in North Houston My wife and I were driving north on Bamel North Houston Road, about 4 miles south of FM 1960 in the Northern suburbs of Houston, about 5 miles SE of the Compaq Computer Campus.  The time was 20:10 local, 01:10 Z. I was driving, my wife was in the passenger's seat. The night was crystal clear and there were many planes in the landing pattern for Houston Intercontintal (IAH) which was about 7 miles to the  due East.  My wife observed the object 30 degrees above the horizon to the NNW first going level and then instantly changing course downward at a 30 degree angle until it disappeared at the tree line.  I saw the object (apparently) after the course change, and it took a couple of seconds to go from an elevation of 30 degrees to the tree line.  My wife describes the object as a yellow orange glowing object.  My description is of a sliver, not bright, yellow orange, which was sort of pinched at either end.  Frankly, it looked a little like the illuminated passenger cabin of an airliner.  However, at the angle and location in question, and considering the high speed of the object, it was not an airliner unless it crashed.  I opened the sunroof and listened for sirens---nothing.  As a VN veteran with many thousands of aircraft seen in the dark in the Tonkin Gulf, I understand strange stuff in the air at night.  This was not a plane unless it crashed just north of Houston tonight.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Extremely bright, cigar shaped object in the night sky near down town Houston.;2008-08-10 01:30:00;seconds;Extremely bright, cigar shaped object in the night sky near down town Houston. Sunday 8-10-2008 Houston TX approximately 1:30 A.M.  The area is near (down town Houston) My family and friends gathered together for my sons 10th birthday every one had left except one of my friends and his wife and children. Four of us were outside  having a conversation when all of a sudden in the sky  three of us saw an enormous and extremely  bright light or object appear in the sky out of no where. By the time I told my friend to turn around the object was shooting off very quickly out of sight.  I have never personally seen anything like this.  This object made no noise and  when it shot off  it was extremely fast like nothing that Iâ€™ve seen before. My wife tried to say it was a shooting star but  this object was moving upward from my point of reference. My wife is more skeptical of what she saw and tries to explain it away but my friends wife and I saw it very well, and could not dismiss it as being a shooting star.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Glowing missile shaped object sited north of Houston IAH and heading towards earth.;2009-04-20 06:30:00;2 seconds;Glowing missile shaped object sited north of Houston IAH and heading towards earth. What appeared to be a glowing fire rocket streaked across the sky and downwards towards the earth. The object appeared to be about 1000 - 1500' in the sky just northwest of the Houston Intercontinental Airport when first sited.  It was traveling from the east downwards to the west.  We were traveling north on JFK Blvd towards Terminal A.  It did not appear to be a meteorite due to its cigar shape.  One of the observers is retired Air Force and said it looks like a missile attack. No crashing boom was heard after it dissappeared towards the ground.  It should have been obvious to the air traffic controllers at the Intercontinental Airport.  No plane crashes have been reported in the area.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
