Skin burns and bad health for all of us.;1973-02-10 16:00:00;2 MIN.;Skin burns and bad health for all of us. We were at the bottom of a sand pit(near lake houston) covered in mud. A loud humm came through the sky. We felt a sense of power against us as the 2 triangles stopped directly above. They hoovered above for a few seconds are so(we still don't agree on that one). They seemed to have no discribable color, other than the reflection of the sky and sun. The humm intensified for a moment and then the objects darted through the sky out of our sight. We have discussed the event at great lenghts since then. I seem to be the only one without selective memory as both friends shun any idea that it was other than an earthly encounter..we all suffered severe skin burns after the encounter and i still possess visible scars. I believe.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
I saw a grey rectangular patch against blue sky, thru binoculars.;1979-01-31 11:00:00;10 minutes;I saw a grey rectangular patch against blue sky, thru binoculars. While watching an ultra light aircraft demonstration, using binoculars, I saw almost directly overhead a light grey rectangular shape against the blue sky. I was looking almost straight up. The rectangular shape had clearly defined edges. The long part of the rectangle was oriented east/west. I looked back at the shape several times in the next few minutes. I always located it quickly in the same spot. It looked like a patch on the sky. There were other spectators around, but none with binoculars. I didn't mention it to anyone, because the demonstration had everyone's attention. After a few minutes, I became very concerned that there was going to be a violent accident with the ultra light aircraft, because the pilot was trying aerobatics in the flimsy craft. I left in my vehicle. I have never mentioned this incident to anyone, nor have I ever again seen anything similar. I am a 69 year old retired banker, a former computer progammer and I was a control tower operator in the Air Force in the late 1940's.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Strange Happenings in Houston 2003;2003-10-24 01:45:00;10 seconds;Strange Happenings in Houston 2003 For about the past two weeks, my partner and I have been seeing a strange occurence in the sky at night when we go out to smoke a cigarette. At approx 1:30 every few nights we have been seeing an object flying without lights in the sky flying out of the south at a very high velocity. The only lights on the object are the ones from the city below. There is no noise, almost like as if you were to be watching a bunch of balloons fly by at a fast rate of speed. Usually when we aren't looking for it is when we see it. It is the shape of a rectangle.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Large white and gray rectangular object hovering in sky.;2004-07-25 18:30:00;about a minute;Large white and gray rectangular object hovering in sky. We were driving east down memorial drive between kirkwood and dairyashford when me and my daughter saw a huge object in the sky. It had to have been larger then a football field. It was white on top and light gray on the bottom. It was rectangular shaped but the top was kind of rounded. Not like anything I have ever seen before. It was pretty far away but it was huge. Probably 5 times bigger then any plane I have seen in the sky. It was also completely motionless. We turned back around to look again because some trees got in the way but it was gone.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
flew by it, 300 meters away, it was floating not moving at 15000 ft, looked directly across at it.;2011-01-24 15:50:00;20 to 30 sec;flew by it, 300 meters away, it was floating not moving at 15000 ft, looked directly across at it. I was on a plane coming from Dallas to Houston and as we approached Houston we entered a storm and heavy clouds.  As I looked out the window I saw, what looked like the top of a radio tower with 3 spires pointing up sticking out of the clouds.  It was not moving and very close to the airplane, maybe 200 - 300 meters tops.  So I though wow we are really close to the ground in thick fog, then we went through another break in the clouds and I saw the ground around 20,000 feet below.  I'm not aware of any radio towers that tall or big.  It was quite large with the base and 3 spirest was big, probably the sized of a small house (800 - 1200 sq ft) base with 3 long spires sticking out the top (sorta like the San Francisco radio tower).  The spires where about the length of an interstate light pole with other things hanging off of it. It was dark grey like a titanium wedding ring color.  I saw from the time it came to view in the front of the window then I leaned forward! and watched it until we went into new cloud bank. It wasn't moving so it was like flying by a building 15 - 30 seconds.  A few people looked  concerned/confused on the plane and I should have stopped and asked the pilot but in all honesty I was a little bit worried about asking around.  I can assure you it was not an illusion or reflection, it was solid as a rock and not obscured.  It was just like staring at a building as you fly by.  There were no flashing lights or anything like that.  I did try and take a picture but my phone didn't boot in time.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Spinning rectangular object traveling at a high velocity in South Texas.;2020-03-15 19:10:00;30 seconds;Spinning rectangular object traveling at a high velocity in South Texas. At 7:10 pm (central time) I noticed a spinning rectangular object that seemed to be traveling at a high velocity.  I was facing north while observing the object.  It was black, rectangular and flashed a light (not pictured in video).  The object appeared to be traveling north west.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
