I was very entranced by this and they were extremely clear to the naked eye.  They did not move sideways, but as stated above.  I'm not sure how high they were, but would guess about 3-5 thousand feet up, about the height of a plane at the mid-line of take-off.  When I arrived home, my roommates stated that there was something on TV that UFOs were seen by a number of people who had called this in.  I told them I saw them, and they said they would not have believed it if I hadn't said that as they were in disbelief.  I will never forget it.  I haven't seen anything like it before nor since.  What was so outstanding to me was not only the shape of the objects, but the beautiful silver look without any glare from the bright sunlight.  I had to go on because the light had already changed for a few minutes, and there were a lot of vehicles behind me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

1997 Houston, Tx., midnite - 1a.m., observed silent, dark, Chevron shaped object, gliding very slowly overhead, tremendous size.;1997-06-01 00:00:00;3-5 mins;1997 Houston, Tx., midnite - 1a.m., observed silent, dark, Chevron shaped object, gliding very slowly overhead, tremendous size. I was walking on the sidewalk outside my apt. behind Sharpstown Mall, after getting off work as a LPN in the long term care facility 2 block's down the road, between midnite & 1a.m. For unknown reason's I felt to look over my shoulder & upward towards the east, where I was literally, in awe at what I saw there. 1st noticed an extremely gigantic size dark object approaching very low, moving very slow, appeared as a giant V shape, as it came more directly over my head, going in an east to west direction. I noticed the underside of the object to appear like rippling dark black liquid motion. As the object continued slowly gliding overhead, I realized it was so huge it blocked out my entire vision of any sky, this object appeared so much larger than my apt. complex, the street, the apt. complex across the street. And at this time, I also realized, the object was completely silent. I also recall like diffuse lighting to the underside, from possibly within, tho ! no light's actually on the outer surfaces. I recall, as the object's backend glided over me, I then observed the solid appearing structure around the outer perimeter of this Chevron shaped object, as I can recall it is best described as, from my only experienc's, as girder structural design. I will admit I've alway's believed in the existance of extraterresterial intelligence, & have read a great many book's on the subject, that is probably why I've only tried to tell a few people of this experience back then when it happened, but, I stopped talking about it, because I was ridiculed by everyone, & still am today by my boyfriend of 9yrs. But, I've alway's had the strong feeling's that I should pursue telling my story, regardless of what other's say or think, & that is why now I'm writing, because in my heart I KNOW WHAT I SAW! I may not know what it was, but, I definitely know I saw it. And can honestly say, that thru-out the entire experience, I felt no fear, I was calm, & ! fully aware to, as accurately as I was able, observe & mentall! y record all I could of this event.  Thank you for giving me a platform to tell my story.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
I saw a boomarang shaped object. It was gliding across the sky.;1999-04-14 00:45:00;5-10 seconds;I saw a boomarang shaped object. It was gliding across the sky. It was 12:45am,4/14/99. I was on the roof of The University of Texas Medical school building.In the Texas Medical Center. It was a partly cloudy night, I was looking up and I saw this object gliding thru the sky, right over head. It was going from southeast to northwest. It was in the sky about half the height of an airliner at 35,000 ft. It wasn't going very fast. At first I thought it was a sea gull. It looked to be some kind of aircraft. It looked like those  movies I saw on those old flying wings on the Discovery channel. As I watched it,it just glided across the sky. It was gray in color with no other markings. The strangest thing is, it had no lights or sound. It just sailed across the sky. One more very strange thing, about 3-5 minutes later, after I was still shaking my head, a shooting star(or something),very fast, came out of the northest and went in the same direction of this object. That object looked to just burn out.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I live southwest of Bush Intercontinental airport and was watching two commercial jets departing, also in a southwesterly direction. I noticed that the planes had  bracketed  an object between them. The planes appeared to be at a greater altitude than this object and were moving at a greater speed. The object was opaque.....no lights were seen and no glow emanated from it. I could not judge the size but I assumed it to be large. As I reported.....it was chevron shaped and one  leg  seemed to be shorter than the other. It did nothing but just seemed to drift to the southwest. I am a Marine Corps Nam vet.......it wasn't an aircraft that I had ever seen. No sound was heard by me.....but with the jets roaring  and all.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
2 boomarangs high and fast over houston on night of lunar full eclipse;2000-02-01 10:00:00;30 seconds;2 boomarangs high and fast over houston on night of lunar full eclipse a few minutes after the moon had finally fully eclipsed, two fast and high moving boomerang or wedged shaped craft made some small turning maneuvers overhead. this was following a deep roaring noise a few seconds ahead of appearing in my view which was sadly slightly limited by a building and garage. after a few minutes a meteorite streaked across the sky and that should have been observed by most moon watchers that night in houston.  my thought at the time was, this was not like the other planes in the sky and if this is a test of ram jet craft, what a dumb night to make a classified flyover, everyone and their dog must be out watching tonight. a local radio station joked about the many sightings and i thought maybe there was something to my sighting after all.  this is not my first sighting and i have also been swooped by scrambled jets from ellington making an illegal night jump in dickinson to fulfill my 'd' license, expert license, in skydiving. flares and radar returns tripped the tower.  i was the ufo.  well there goes my credibility, huh.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
black slow moving  V shape object over houston s george bush airport;2008-08-17 18:30:00;20 min;black slow moving  V shape object over houston s george bush airport We were at a business along beltway 8. The object came from the southeast to northwest over george bush airport. It was black sort of v shape. At first i thought it was an ultralite but it appeared to be over 1500 ft in air and i think ultra lites are allowed to fly 500 ft and below and definitely not allowed to fly over airspace like the bush airport. It was hard to see clearly due to clouds and the distance but it slowed down and seem to turn back to the southeast. the speed was not very fast. I like to know if anyone else had seen this object in air or another incidence elsewhere.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
