As we drove up the elevated roadway, our eyes were naturally directed up towards the sky when we saw a red ball of light suddenly appear, then become elongated in a slightly inclined horizontal position, then disappear towards the north, after returning to the size of a small red ball of light. A red ball of light appeared in the dark horizon as I was driving with a friend on Loop 610 South near I-45 in Houston.  The light suddenly appeared in the far distance, became elongated as if moving to the north, then returned to the size of a small red ball before disappearing.  It was almost as if the object were moving so quickly that it was in more than one place at one time, a sort of optical illusion.  Both of the observers are honors students at a private university in Houston, one being president of the student council, the other vice-president of the Houston area Model United Nations.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Blue Flash of Light which covered the SE sky (not man-made).;2004-04-30 23:15:00;1 sec;Blue Flash of Light which covered the SE sky (not man-made). 2nd flash i had seen like this, but in different locations and dates. Driving home late from the office, when a flash of blue light lit up the SE sky. So bright i do not think man could duplicate it. Light it up for a good solid second, then disappeared. Other drivers on the highway must hv seen the same thing as it was in a very populated area of Houston. Also a few brake lights lit up after the flash occcured, so it seems i was not the only one that saw this.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Flashes of Greenish/Blue light over Clear Lake;2007-12-21 18:04:00;15 Sec. in 1-2 Sec. inter;Flashes of Greenish/Blue light over Clear Lake I was in my backyard at 6:04pm, I know the time exactly because I looked at the time, then at the moon.  As I looked at the moon and the stars, as I do everynight, off to my right, just above the treeline, there was a bright greenish/blue flash.  Honestly as I caught the tail end of it, my first thought was, someone had set of some fireworks, even though there was no noise, and I just caught the cast off falling to the ground.  While looking at this spot in the sky, to hopefully see the next flash as it happened, another flash appeared to the left in the sky, I turned to look at it, but it was gone, then right in front of me again above the treeline, another flash, and then again to the right, yet another.  Whatever this was, it moved so fast that I couldn't keep up.  I never once got to actually look right at it.  It was the most beautiful light, and I have been looking for it to happen again the last few nights, but nothing.  If anyone saw this, over the Clear Lake area, please confirm that I don't just have some tumor that was rapid firing in my brain.  Thanks, anyone with ideas of what it was would be nice as well.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
In a flash it was gone.;2011-08-26 00:45:00;30 seconds;In a flash it was gone. Outside smoking a cigarette, and noticed a strobe of blue/red lights coming from West of I-45. The object stayed stationery for about 25 seconds then made a bright white flash and was gone in a blink of an eye.  This is my second sighting this year and I'm not sure if its coincidental or what, but after both siightings, a small private plane circles the sky in the area that objects appeared. It seems on botg occassions the small plane was chasing and/or looking for unknown object.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Orb in the sky.;2013-02-15 01:00:00;2 minutes;Orb in the sky. I was driving home from my night shift at the Houston Chronicle, around 1 a.m.  I was on Interstate 10 right where it intersects 610, the night sky was clear, the Houston air disgustingly sick and muggy as usual.  Where those two highways intersect, there is an area of commerce called the Marq’E. While driving, I saw a glowing light in the sky.  The light was neon-green ish in color and nothing else around it. It was more of an orb the shape resembled a low-hanging star, but there’s no way a star would appear this low.  It was hard to judge exactly how high up in the sky this orb was, and I wasn’t in the position to stop my vehicle to better gauge its positioning from the highway.   Houston drives are horrible, so, all I could do was stare in awe and wonder.  The orb had a luminous glow around it, as the clear Houston sky that held it, showed some of the green rays permeating from it.  Have you ever been on your back in the grass at night just staring up at the sky and admiring the stars?  This is what this orb reminded me of, star gazing.  I gazed, while avoiding not crashing, almost making eye contact with the light.  And then, just like that in the blink of an eye, the orb shot downward, out of view disappearing.

Shooting ticket type of craft, high in the night sky, which seemed to take off like a sci fi space ship going into light speed.;2014-03-18 20:45:00;2 seconds;shooting ticket type of craft, high in the night sky, which seemed to take off like a sci fi space ship going into light speed I was smoking a cigarette in the parking lot of my apartment complex.  I had just gotten home from work.  I gazed at the night sky. I was looking at all of the stars.  And instantly I saw what looked like a rocket flash from a high altitude and shoot horizontally across the sky.  It went from left to right.   What shocked me was that it didn't fall out shot at an angle.  This thing went in a perfectly horizontal line for about 2 seconds before vanishing.
