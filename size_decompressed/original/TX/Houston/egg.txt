Saw what at first appeared to be 2 stars in the horizon.;1999-10-04 19:51:00;19:54;Saw what at first appeared to be 2 stars in the horizon. Coming home going west to the interstate 45, i noticed the sun going down and the sky was a brilliant orange red. I looked again and saw what appeared to be stars, but then noticing  that can't be with the sun still up. They were above the sun and one was above the other but offset a little to the south. The bright obects had a orange glow. I assume because of the sky. I saw a commercial airplane leaving Houston Intercontinental and was heading west towards the objects. As i was looking again, the one object on top got bigger and looked kinda like a egg, but had two orange lights on the front. In an instant they were both gone. I searched the sky but did not see them again. I learned tonight a friend of mine saw the same thing a few nights earlier farther north near his home @ about 02:30. ((NUFROC Note:  Duration of sighting is unknown.));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Dual White/Black/Red Ovalesques over Clear Lake, Texas;2006-06-23 16:50:00;~2 minutes;Dual White/Black/Red Ovalesques over Clear Lake, Texas My office cubical is on the sixth floor of a building in the Clear Lake, Texas area, and it has a large bank of windows with a view of the east-south-east towards Galveston Bay. I was standing at that bank of windows when, to my north-east, I saw two oval objects seem to rise together out of the trees in a nearby neighborhood. What impressed me were two things:  1. The difference in altitude remained very constant. The forward-aft distance changed slightly, but they seemed fixed to each other in altitude from each other.  2. Both objects looked identical, but with variations in color/configuration. These changes were seen in unison.  Also, we have a lot of traffic to and from Ellington airfield, including formation flights of the local Air National Guard. These were most definitely F-16's as the ANG unit uses, and their relative position/speed was much slower than that of any plane at the apparent alititude.  As for a description of the objects:  1. Somewhat oval in shape with possibly points to the side. 2. The main bulk was white, the bottom black, and some red on the top surface. The shape and relative proportion of these features changed periodically during it's visibility to me.  I watched the objects transit from their position along a rough vector west to possibly north-west. After Two minutes, the objects passed beyond the corner of the building. I was not able to re-aquire the objects in view after that.  One more side note, probably coincidental: I saw flying along the same basic vector, shortly after the objects were obscured from my view, a small aircraft, possibly a helicopter. It was moving much faster than the two previous objects.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Gray egg shaped object with many colored lights flying low in the sky, then either vanishing or flying away very quickly.;2007-03-09 19:30:00;5 minutes;Gray egg shaped object with many colored lights flying low in the sky, then either vanishing or flying away very quickly. I am a graphic designer, age 30. The other witness is my girlfriend, a paralegal, age 23. We were driving to our 7:30 dinner reservation, which we were late for, and as I was going along my street I saw a bright star off to my left. I'm always looking out for ufos so I made some comment about this star to my girlfriend, and she replied to stop looking at it and look where I was driving.  At the next intersection I turned left, and now the object was in the sky in front of us (and slightly left of the road). The light had grown and now it was no longer a star, but many blinking lights. Its altitude in the sky was much lower than a plane, maybe between 500 and 1000 feet up. My first thought was Damn that thing has lots of lights but I actually wrote it off as a plane because my eyesight is poor and I couldn't see any detail. Then a few seconds later my girlfriend (whose eyesight is better than mine) said What IS that thing? I looked over at it again and I asked her to tell me what she was seeing. She could actually see the solid object and said it was grey and egg shaped, and covered with blinking lights. It was flying about as fast as a plane or a helicopter, but erratically. I could see the blinking lights, which were multicolored (there were at least a dozen lights to my reckoning), but my eyesight was not good enough to discern the shape.  By this time it had flown further to our left. I said screw the reservation! and I took the next left to follow it. The trees obscured our view temporarily but I drove in the direction that it was in the sky. As soon as we got to a clearer view, the object was nowhere to be seen. We were both very baffled, because it should've been visible in the sky.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
