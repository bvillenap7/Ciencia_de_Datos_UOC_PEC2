I saw several high flying objects hovering in the clear blue sky and make a formation before disappearing.;2004-02-21 12:30:00;10 mins;I saw several high flying objects hovering in the clear blue sky and make a formation before disappearing. I saw a shiny object which seemed a great distance away.  Suddenly there were several more and they seemed to create a formation in the sky.  I ran to get my video camera and shot some of it on tape.  The formation had changed somewhat and some of the objects were already gone by the time I got my camera.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
three changing color groups of lights hovering over rooftops;2008-03-05 05:40:00;15 minutes;three changing color groups of lights hovering over rooftops I was awakened this morning about 5:40 am here in west Houston by my 17 year old daughter who was up early for school. She was sitting eating breakfast and happened to notice a strange light out the back window. She said she watched it, got her sister (15), and witnessed three distinct groups of lights hovering over the rooftops in the distance. They said they could see a dark object in the center of one, but two were just hovering as changing colored lights (at different heights),  That's when they woke me. I ran outside to see and confirmed two of these objects. At an arms length I'd say they were about the size of an aspirin or peanut.  Fairly large and distinct with 4 or 5 lights making up a cross or diamond shape.  The lights were pulsating and changing colors: red, green, blue, white, turquoise.  They were hovering at different heights above the rooftops of the next neighborhood.  One was very low, just barely over the rooftops, the other about twice the height of the homes below. I went in to get my astronomical telescope to see if I could zero in on it. While I was trying to sight it, the one I was watching reduced in size, turned orange and began to move to my right. I followed it around to the front of my house and watched it slowly move parallel to the ground just above the rooftops until it disappeared behind homes. The other light was gone when I looked back. My daughter tried to film it, but could not get it focused due to palm fronds interfering with autofocus. However, you can see the two objects and the colors that they were cycling through. We don't know, of course, what it was, but the two objects I saw were silent. About twenty minutes later I went back outside and saw an aircraft approaching from a different part of the horizon and could clearly hear that it was a helicopter.  So I use that in contrast to the silence of the first sighting. The night sky was clear, but moonless, so it was very dark.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
On video'ing, and photographing, UFO's are positioned in front of our view of both Venus & Sirius.  ((NUFORC Note:  We disagree.  PD));2009-01-17 20:00:00;Hours;On video'ing, and photographing, UFO's are positioned in front of our view of both Venus & Sirius. I am reporting two main objects.  I noticed that your website has other reports that you are tentatively classifing as Venus & Sirius, but they are not.  They are both UFO's, or UFO docking stations of some kind. One is the bright starlike object in front of our view of Venus. The other is the bright starlike object in front of our view of Sirius.    As one who has always been a sky watcher, and who takes photos daily & nightly, I know what I am seeing.    These objects are at lower altitude than a planet, or star, and block our view of these natural objects. I've been watching & photographing them for months. Description:   The SW object changes shapes which can be seen visually, and the lights appear to change colors.  It also seems to react to being photographed with more light pulses, brightening.  The object in front of Sirius shows the same characteristics. Both followed the natural path of Venus and Sirius across the night time sky.  If you get a camera on them, they are no further up than the usual low altitude UFO's that glide above many of our neighborhoods at night.   I would estimate the faux Venus object to be about 1 mile up, at most.  The faux Sirius object is probably 1 1/2 to 2 miles up, judging by it's size when video'd. This west side of Houston is a little known hot spot, with activity most days & nights when the weather is good. I will include video links at the email address you have provided that include photos, both original and enhanced to bring out the detail. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  We disagree with much of what is written above.  We believe we are fairly adept at identifying reports of both Venus and Sirius.  We do not know what a UFO docking station station is, but we would like to see a photograph of such an object.

ufo sighting in houston,texas;2010-06-28 21:35:00;30 minutes;ufo sighting in houston,texas Around 9:35,a group of us witnessed a ufo in the sky,at altitude,in the west.  It appeared to be at about 3500 feet altitude, and was a very bright bluish-white light,changing occassionally to a flashing orange,then back to bluish white.It was not moving,but hovering,for most of the time we were watching it.  There appeared to be beams emitting from the craft every three minutes or so.  It appeared spherical at first,orb-shaped,but then would morph into a diamond shape,and the bluish-white light would pulsate.It changed from spherical to diamond shaped about four times during this period.  Finally,it gained altitude and moved south,towards the coast.this was seen by myself and many others.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Ufos that mimic planes everyday occurrence now.;2018-08-01 23:00:00;15 minutes;Ufos that mimic planes everyday occurrence now. My oldest sons, 18 and 19, are the ones who recorded this time.  They were not sure if it was a plane or not.  But it obviously isn't.  Above my mothers house every night after 23:00 hours they come out the most.  But I see them all day as planes.  Like a hologram with a sound put out.  But it changes shapes to fast and follows us.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
