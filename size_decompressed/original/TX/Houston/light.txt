The three things I saw were things in the sky that I could not explain.  The first two occurred at night in 1970.  They only amounted to lights in the sky, but I will never forget them, as I will explain.  Two friends witnessed the first sighting and one of the friends witnessed the second.  The third event happened during the day about 15 years later and was seen only by me. The sighting was in Houston.  My two friends and I looked up one night and saw a star-like light crossing the night sky.  We thought it was a satellite, so we watched it.  After traversing across about one half of the sky the object changed directions by 90 degrees.  It did not turn.  It did not slow down.  It simply changed directions.  One instant it was traveling thousands of mile per hour in one direction, and the next instant it was traveling thousands of miles per hour in a direction 90 degrees to the first direction.  It finally went out of sight over the horizon.  The three of us commented about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Satellite that behaved very unsatellitish.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from aviation mechanic.  PD));1974-04-23 21:00:00;5-7 seconds;A satellite that behaved very unsatellitish I was born and raised in Houston, Texas I am 57 and the first 7 years of my life we lived off the approach to Hobby airport and also Ellington was a very active Air Force base in those days.  We moved to the north side of the city just about 5 to 6 miles south of what became Houston Intercontinental Airport now named Bush.    When I was about 18 or 19, I can’t remember the exact date but I believe the summer of 1973 or 74 a high school buddy and myself were out in the drive way at my next door neighbor looking up at the stars it was a clear night.  It was about an hour or maybe two after sundown.  We took note of a bright light about the size of a star.  Noting that there were no strobes, we figure it to be a satellite.  The house we were at is north of downtown Houston off US 59 at E. Mt Houston east about 2 miles from the 59.  We at first thought it to be Skylab, but noting it was moving from the south heading north and the news media said Skylab would be in a east west travel we figured it a weather satellite.  That worked for us up until it speeded up greatly.  It then went into about 4 or 5 loops then back and forth through the loops it just made and straight up and disappeared into the blackness of space. Total time of sighting was about 5 to 7 seconds from first sighting until it left our sight.  It streaked so fast there was the impression of a light trail.  As it was doing its maneuvers it would go bright to dim giving me the impression of a shape like a coin flashing in the bright sun light.  If it was a disk then at that altitude it had to be huge and it had to have travel hundreds of miles in a matter of seconds.  That date was over 40 years ago but I can still see it, it shook my buddy and my self up.  The first person we tried to tell was my Uncle who snickered at us.  We both decided not to tell anyone.  I have through my life but to a select few.  I have included it in a book I wrote on the subject.  I am by trade a Aircraft mechanic. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Two multicolored stationary distant lights in sky;1991-07-01 19:00:00;1 hour;Two multicolored stationary distant lights in sky Lights hovering over the city to the west from near Kirby and Holcombe Blvd. Lights appeared stationary 20-30 degrees elevation, very distant. Lights changed color rapidly, I saw red, green, white, and I think blue. I pointed them out to a gentleman who appeared to be in his 60s, walking his dog, and he said, Well, I guess you've seen your first UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Swirling lights coming out of larger light at high altitude. Fast with trails.  Aware of us observing.;1995-05-10 19:00:00;2 hrs;Swirling lights coming out of larger light at high altitude. Fast with trails.  Aware of us observing. Noticed a star split apart and began watching it join and split several times.  Then noticed several lights  moving thru the sky seeming to chase each other and following the exact turns of the one in front of it.  Moving at a high rate of speed and then slowing to almost hover.  My friend and I watched this for about 40 min and decided to go away from the city lights to get a better view of them. Each smaller light eventually returned to the larger one and it seemed to catch it.  The larger obgect matched the speed and trajectory of the smaller object as it merged for just a moment and then returned to its previous position. And then it got weird, I had noticed that they left a slight trail on the retina like a flashbulb dot but just a trace so you could see the lines of their movement.  I began playing this game with them where I'd look into an empty portion of sky and one would fly right into the spot I was looking at, stop and then began zipping around again.  I did this maybe 10 times before it really began to freak me out as it seemed they knew what I was looking at. My friend had noticed the same thing and said they were writing in the sky  I was about 25yds. from the truck and My friend yelled there was one in the trees about 100yds. behind me - I looked and dismissed it as a ballfield light.  Then he cracked well then why is it moving? and as I looked back it was rising above the trees and had lit them up from the side I was on, so I ran like hell screaming start the truck over and over.  It cast my shadow on the ground as I ran.  Looking back it was moving over the field without a sound casting very bright beams of slightly bluish light. Made it to the truck, dived in the back and screamed hit it. It went srtaight up and disappeared.  This event still freaks me out. More or less went right home, locked up the house and didin't sleep until daybreak.  Feel very fortunate it backed off, hope to never see another event.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Orange ball of light;1995-10-01 22:00:00;2 minutes;This was a while back, but I have never forgotten this.  I recently seen a documentary with a re-enactment that looked like exactly what I seen.  Before this I had no clue what was this was.  My dad and I seen a orange ball of light that came down in a field as if it was a helicopter but speeded away and disappeared from sight in seconds.  This happened in SW Houston over 25 yrs ago;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
My wife and I witnessed around 10 to 13 amber  lights flying in a 'V' formation at a high rate of speed over Houston.;1997-04-28 22:00:00;30 seconds;Summary : My wife and I witnessed around 10 to 13 amber  lights flying in a 'V' formation at a high rate of speed over Houston. My wife and I had just stepped out of our apartment in west Houston to try and see if the comet was still out.  She noticed some lights in the sky, which she said were in the shape of a kite.  When she told me to look, I  saw what looked to be a large triangle in the western sky.  As the lights moved toward us and toward Houston, I realized there were around 10 to 13 individual amber colored lights flying in a perfect V formation.  They were going extremely fast, and seemed to be at a very high altitude.   They passed to the south of us, and as they neared Houston,  started shifting positions.  Once over the downtown area, we started losing sight because of the lights of the city, but the lights appeared to stop.  As soon as this happened, we bolted for the video camera. On our return, we could no longer see them.  The  time from sighting in the west until they were over downtown was around 30 seconds or so.  I did some rough estimates of speed based on where I thought the!y were at first (Sealy??).  No jet flies at ~10,000 mph.I am an electrical engineer from ((Name deleted)) University by education (War Eagle!), and I work at ((Name deleted)) as a programmer.  My wife is a  student at University of Houston.  This was the first truly bizarre thing either of us has witnessed.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

The sky was a bit overcast and the lights appeared very distant and moved rapidly. The easternmost light moved back and forth and side to side very rapidly and appeared to wabble. At one point the erratic light seemed to touch the light in center and then it turned 180 degrees moving to the southeast and left the formation. Don't know what is was but quite positive it was not airplane, star, sattelite, lightbug and was definetly not a  hallucination. The lights were light orange color and made no sound at all. None of the following characteristics apply.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

While the light was red, a blue light, then green was visible next to the red light For approximately 1 to 2 minutes, a red light was traveling N/E along the Hardy tollway. In the distance, red warning lights are visible on radio towers. Because I could see the distant red warning lights, this red light caught my attention. I was surprised to see the blue light appear next to the red light, which was constant, and even more surprised to see the green light appear next to the red light.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Motionless, obvious to be a great distance away I was leaving my office for lunch and I walk from my building to a guard shack. Between my bldg. and the guard shack I noticed a new light in the night sky. looking s-se and about 30 degrees inclination a bright yellow-orange, more yellow than a halogen light, sitting in the sky. No motion whatsoever could be discerned. I entered the guard shack and told the captian of this and he came outside with me and it was gone. no trace anywhere in the sky. I blew it off for the most part, however I did discuss it with colleagues and a late night guard seargant and my girlfriend as well. I forgot about it until I read the reports from last night at CAUS.org. I work and live very near two different airports and know that even at a great distance at night you can see both strobes and movement of aircraft and I noticed neither of these. I also live in an area where we have quite a bit of aerial police helicopter activity and the search lights are very different from this. No one I have spoken to has seen this but me.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I was at my desk this morning, I caught a green light in the corner of my eye. I thought it was a helicopter, it was moving very fast. I said look at that helicopter. But as I watched it streaked by i realized it was not a helicopter. It left a small white spark behind the light and dissapeared. It was not a meteor, it left no trail. Except for the small spark. It was definately a green light. This was at 3:30am and I also noticed helicopters flying around the area. I wondered why they were flying around that late at night. it was odd seeing that bright green light streaking across the sky. Again it had no tail or trail.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Very bright, consistent brightness, just a small, narrow, oval shape - reminded me of comet Hale Bop's shape,(but no visible tail behind it). It was descending very slowly, maybe covering an inch of sky per minute. It seemed to be something entering the atmosphere, burning.  Too slow to be a meteorite and too fast to be a comet - maybe space junk? Watched until 17:20 hrs when went out of sight below treeline/horizon. The day was very clear, the sun was still up, altho setting - I am an astronomy buff - so I know where all the planets are and anyway it was too light for any stars or planets to appear yet and Venus is in west/setting now and Jupiter and Saturn in east/rising - so was not a planet. Believe must hv been some space junk.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Low flying shape shifting light sphere spotted by commuters 3 days in a row;2001-05-11 05:00:00;30min;Low flying shape shifting light sphere spotted by commuters 3 days in a row My uncle spotted a light that appeared over Houston in the early hours. It was round and bright but too low to be a star and seemed to be following the highway. It was no chopper or plane becaused it was sphere shaped. The following day it appeared again and spotted by several people at the park and ride.  The following day expecting another sighting of the sphere my uncle grabbed his binoculars to get a close up view.  What he saw was bright orb surrounded by a outer layer of of some sort like the way and ameoba looks under a microscope.  As hit traveled down the highway the outer layers moved around like water ripples.  I don't know if this is  extraterrestial or not but it is defitely wierd I am going to check it out and see it for my self as it has been spotted four days already by several people. Im going to take a digital camera to get some shots. Only problem is it is only seen like at 4:30 in the moring and its hard for me to wake up that early even for a ufo spotting and with my luck I will show up with a digital and the sphere will not appear that day.more to come hopefully;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Houston, Texas - Red pulsating light which dropped another light disappeared in the sky;2001-07-04 23:20:00;45 minutes;Houston, Texas - Red pulsating light which dropped another light disappeared in the sky I spotted a bright red light to the left of a star in the clear sky.  I dismissed it as a plane since it did not move in relation to the star within 5 minutes.  Another red light dropped from the light approximately 1 inch below the primary light and then disappeared.  The primary light moved to the right slowly during a 5 minute period.  I grabbed my video camera and tripod hoping that the zoom feature may shed some light on what was causing this bright red light.  During the next 10 minutes, I observed the light pulsating- growing brighter like a light on top of a tower to almost disappearing in the clear sky then brighter again.  The light then gradually moved up above the neighboring star (during several minutes) and then stayed still. The light would dim to almost nothing then appear again.  Eventually, after 45 minutes, the light disappeared.  Please note that the sky was clear, no clouds or wind, no rain, and the neighboring star remained constant and visible during the observation dismissing the possibility of clouds interfering with the brightness of the light. I am a college educated, drug-free, teacher who has never seen anything like this before.  My husband is also drug-free ( I feel I must include that one) and very sane as well.  We are VERY normal and extremely skeptical at the possibility of this being a UFO, but of course, I have no other explantation.

Flashing Lights Over Houston Texas;2003-02-15 21:00:00;5 min.;Flashing Lights Over Houston Texas I have been aware of your site for years but didn't really think to write this down until now.  Anyway, I was sitting in my back yard smoking a cigarette about 9 pm sometime during the early part of the year (I think it was in February) when I suddenly noticed a bright glowing object off to my right perhaps 1000-1500 ft. away and perhaps 50 degree angle from my position on the ground.  The object really caught my attention because it made several rapid jerking maneuvers and then went through a rainbow of colors in a few seconds and then started flashing a white light.  I quickly ran to the back door to call my roommate.  He came out and observed the original object which had now begun to move to the northwest at a rather slow helicopter-like speed.  By this time, two additional objects (flashing the same white light) appeared and were moving into formation with the first object.  What was striking about their movement was its unnaturalness if you will.  They both moved very quickly and literally stopped in an exact triangular formation with the first object.  Then all three began flashing the same white light in unison.  Suddenly, we noticed two additional objects literally appear out of no where and move into formation with the first three in the same odd manner.  We watched the 5 objects move out of sight to the northwest.  The entire sighting lasted perhaps 5 minutes.  It should be noted that traditional aircraft were clearly visible at the time of the sighting as we live in the flight path of Bush International Airport and a local airport.  We have never seen a UFO but we are confident we have now!;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Mundane Satellite?;2003-10-23 21:00:00;2 minutes;Mundane Satellite? It is a fun thing to do in the evening to count the satellites seen with the naked eye after sunset.  These are very small dots of light traveling in various directions, and at different speeds. The average viewable time is approximately 1 1/2 minute.  For the past several evenings I have spotted what appear to be satellites coming from slightly west of North traveling in a straight line toward the South.  As they approach a point about about half way across their transit, they make a turn to the right, and accelerate at a high rate toward the West.  As they start to make the turn, they appear to slow down.  There is no sound or lights, or any clue that they are anything other than mundane satellites. The speed they achieve as they travel to the West is amazing.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I could not tell whether they were in front or in back of the clouds, however.  I drove down the street, west on West Little York toward Hwy 290, and I saw two young men taking photos of the lights.

The lights were about 400 yards apart from one another and faded away the higher they traveled.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Beam of light in NE Houston;2004-08-21 21:00:00;about 2 or b3 hours;Beam of light in NE Houston On the same date a colum  of light was seen over the skies of NE Houston. Several people saw this and believed that it was a UFO. I did too and took video of it. The wether conditions were not that great, there was light rain and low clouds. After reviewing the video and stepping outside to see it once more. We all concluded that it was not a ufo. First off most of us work at petrochemical plants and this reminded us of something. Usualy the when the large flares go off at the plant it makes some kind of a simmilar beam of light effect high over the flare. In that direction is one of the larger plants(Equistar) in the area and they had there largest flare on during that night. The beam of light had a haze around it, which could have been from the clouds around it or rain. The initial sighting was made at this location N25'45.17  W95'14.61 (WGS84). Direction of the Light from that point was northeast at 51'm.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
An orange vertical column of light in the northeast sky;2004-08-21 22:00:00;20 minutes;An orange vertical column of light in the northeast sky In the north east sky at 45 degrees, a vertical column of orange light hovered in mid air for at least 20 minutes.  Clouds passed between ourselves and the column of light and it increased and decreased in brightness in a pulsating manner.  We thought that it might be a meteroid or comet however it never moved and then just disappeared.  One other person on the street observed the same event.

Two lights in the sky with orbs surrounding them.;2006-01-06 00:00:00;2 hours;Two lights in the sky with orbs surrounding them. I looked out my window when i noticed what i thought was a star.  After 10 minutes a looked back out and i noticed that the star was on the other side of my window.  Thats when i noticed that it began to move.  It went up then down the left then it would dissappear and reappear on the other side of the window.  Finally it stopped moving and thats when i noticed that there were 2 lights in the sky now.  Then i noticed orbs circling around the UFO's.  Lights just kept on circling them, like i would see 10 then they would dissapear, then i'd see 10 more lights.  During the course of the night the UFo's moved from the left part of my window to the right part, up and down.  I witnessed them for about 2 hours and they never left.  Half the time they would be stopped in the sky and just look like a star.  But when i began to doubt that it was a UFO it would move again and i would clear see orbs circling them.  Also when it would move it would sometimes leave a blurry trail.  Sometimes the orbs coming out of the craft looked like beams.

Luminous Point Lights Spiral in the Texas Sky;2006-02-13 09:40:00;30 seconds;Luminous Point Lights Spiral in the Texas Sky While driving down Space Center Blvd in Clear Lake City, TX (a suburb of Houston) I noticed a glint of light in the sky. This light would have been approximately 30 to 35 degrees elevation, and was not much more than a pinhead in size. I originally thought it was a plane at high altitude, but it was soon followed by another very similar point light. These two lights then proceeded to circle each other for another 15-20 seconds, and seemed to either descend slightly together, or possibly were heading downrange. They were no longer visible after that time.  As for the one witness, myself, I am a mechanical engineer working for a NASA contractor. I am thirty-six years old and am a Houston native.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

What caught my attention was that they appeared to look like stars in the sky but they spacing between them was too close.  As I continued to peer in the same direction I turned my head to view neighboring stars in the sky but none of them looked that bright.  The one of the left has a burning red color and the other on the right was a pearl white.   Take note that when I initially saw them they were both white and then within 7 seconds they faded off too fast into the night sky.

The light was white, slightly larger than a bright planet.  I first noticed the light stationery or virtually stationery in the sky for a few seconds. I assumed that it was a star, planet, or perhaps an aircraft moving straight toward me, and appearing to be mostly stationery. Nothing about its appearance at this point was especially noteworthy.  Then, suddenly, from its stationery point in the sky, the object appeared to drop rapidly straight toward the horizon. The object appeared to simply fall from the sky. It moved far more rapidly than any conventional aircraft could have moved.  Simply stated, it looked like a very bright star that came unstuck from the fabric of the sky and fell downward. It was quite a remarkable sight. I saw it clearly and I am certain that I am not mistaken about what I saw.  As it fell, my view of the object was occluded by buildings closer to the horizon.  Since I had clearly seen it stationery, I am certain that it was not a shooting star. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright White light seen moving across Houston nighttime skies.;2008-06-10 20:30:00;one minute;Bright White light seen moving across Houston nighttime skies. On the evening of June 10, 2008, at aprox. 10:30 pm, as I was out with my dogs in the front yard of our home, I witnessed a large, bright white light moving across the suburban Houston, Texas sky from the northwest, heading into the southeast, at a level of about a mile or so high. This object did not display ANY sort of a tell-tale sign of any know aircraft to our American skies (i.e. no blinking lights, no red or green lights, nothing). The object was not moving very quickly, but at a steady pace across the night sky  I quickly ran inside to get my wife to witness this event. She in turn came out to the yard and also observed the light as I have described. The object took about a minute to cross the sky above us, so it was not even moving as fast as the planes that do cross our skies daily. As we both watched, hoping that this object would display SOMETHING to let us know that it was man made, we observed the object become a bit brighter in the sky, and then with the blink of an eye, it was gone.  We both turned and looked at each other in disbelief, and both of us said almost simultaneously, “It made no sound.” As we were watching the object go across the sky, I even made a small comment out loud: “I don’t hear any engines. If it’s a plane, we should be able to hear the sound of the engines.” There was NO SOUND.  My wife was a bit shocked and perplexed, as she has not had any “encounters” that she has ever told me of. For me, this was one of many “sightings” that I have witnessed above the Houston skies. Nothing that truly warranted a report…until now.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Light in the sky changing colors, moving very fast, dancing in one spot;2008-06-11 22:40:00;25 minutes;Light in the sky changing colors, moving very fast, dancing in one spot It was Wednesday, June 11, 2008 at about 10:40pm. I looked out of the window, near the center of Houston, TX, looking to the east, and saw a light that looked somewhat like a blinking star. As I looked, it seemed to have different colors as it blinked. I also noticed that it didn't look hazy as if it were blinking from clouds passing by. My brother and my girlfriend came out, saw the same thing, but we all thought it could possibly be an airplane. After about 5 min or so, the light was still in the same place in the sky, not seeming to get closer or further away. It looked extremely far away (remember, I compared it to a star at first, so I'd say it was some miles away). We got some very cheap binoculars and looked at it again. At that point, all 4 of us that were there all saw the same thing. The light was moving around very fast, not seeming to be traveling anywhere, but just dancing around all different patterns in the same vicinity. The light was also not just red and green, but all different colors, constantly changing. I noticed that while I was watching, 2 planes flew by, about 3 min apart from each other, but they didn't go anywhere near the object or even in its direction. It was still there when my girlfriend and I left, which was a few minutes after 11pm. I wish I could see that direction from my apartment, but I can't because of the buildings.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

My boyfriend and I were saying our goodbyes for the night while looking up in the sky.  I noticed two particular stars that were very near each other.  I saw one start moving to the north in an arc while the other one stayed still.  Then the second star moved to the west, also in an arc. Due to the trees, I lost the second one behind the high pine trees.  However, my boyfriend followed the first until it faded away. About five minutes later, I spot another moving star and then the fourth another five minutes after that. I know for a fact that our government does not have aircraft that can fly that high in our atmosphere at a constant high rate speed.  I call them stars because that is how they looked due to being so high up in the atmosphere. After the moving stars, my boyfriend sees a very bright light.  A light too bright to be a planet. Also, there was no twinkling to it, but a pulsating light.  We know where Venus is in relation to the moon as well as Mars. Every night, my boyfriend and I watch the skies and wish aloud that there was no light pollution to affect our view.  He went home to tell his family about it and to show them the bright, pulsating star. They too have confirmed that it is moving across the sky at a faster rate than the Moon, Venus, and the North Star.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Orange lights seen over the Houston area traveling east to west in pairs.;2010-04-24 23:07:00;10 minutes;Orange lights seen over the Houston area traveling east to west in pairs. I was traveling east on McGregor St going from the Houston Medical Center to highway 288. At about 11:05pm I saw lights over a line of trees to my left from inside of my car. I kept driving down the road until the trees to my left ended and I came to an intersection where the traffic light was red. I stopped at the intersection and rolled down my driver side window and I could see the lights traveling horizontally from west to east across the horizon. There were about 20 - 30 lights in the sky traveling in pairs one on top of the other. As they moved across the sky, the pairs would switch spots within the formation (the one on the bottom would move to the top).  When the light turned green, I pulled into a parking lot of a restaurant, which was closed for the night, and continued to watch them move across the sky. I was in the parking lot for about 3 minutes and I decided to keep traveling east on McGregor. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I kept followin! g the lights with my eyes. I came to another intersection and took a left to turn around (to go west on McGregor). While I was waiting for the light to turn green I noticed 7 lights identical to the ones that were traveling across the horizon and saw that they were stationary and in a tight formation. The formation was 3 lines. One line was at a 90 degree angle, and the other 2 at a 45 degree angle, with one on the right and left and they all met in the middle with the other light in the formation. At this point, I called my wife and told her about what I saw. She told me to go pick her up from home because she wanted to see the lights. I picked her up, but once we got there the lights were gone. Traveling home and back took about 20 minutes.

Event is still happening- a point of light in the sky, like a star, but brighter.  When I first observed it, it was stationary, East-Southeast of my driveway,about 85 degrees above me, appearing to be very high, but not as high as a satellite.    As I looked at it, it started moving.  The point of light sort of meandered around in seemingly random smooth movements, but then at times it made jerky, short straight movements, and at times moved at a high rate of speed in straight lines.  The light progressed very gradually from East-Southeast to Southwest.  I checked estimated the direction where I first observed the light, and then checked the direction that I was seeing the light by using a compass that I keep in my car (which was next to me). The sky tonight is the clearest I have ever seen in Houston, not a cloud visible in the sky from my observation point (I could not see West from my position because of my house).  I do not believe this light was someone shining a laser at the sky because there were no clouds to reflect the light.

It did not seem to be flashing or making any form of movement.   After watching it for another 5 minutes or so, I concluded it must be a cell phone or other tower that I had not noticed inspite of it being very high and even though I have lived here for 30 + years.   When I went out later that day, I looked in that direction but there is no such structure where I had seen the lights.  I have looked in that direction several times since and there is nothing there to have caused that light.   I am a very very normal everyday person (retired) and am puzzled and perhaps a tiny bit scared of what I may have seen.

The lights were red, white and green and it appeared to have a long shape from left to right or thats how it appeared.  It was dark already so all I saw was the shape of the lights in a line.  The lights were in a line but from right to left like maybe 5 or 6 lights that faced us. We stared for awhile to make sure it was not a helicopter or plane and it was! not.  The objects appeared between my house and a neighbors house.  No other objects or lights in sight except for the 2 objects we saw.  The objects did not make any noises. Nor did they dart or zip away.  No wobbling. Just flew the same as a plane or helicopter would but was not either one.  What made it different was that they it hovered in place and moved slowly like they wanted us to see them.  I heard no plane sounds nor the sound of the helicopter wings when a helicopter is staying in place.  Nothing could be heard.  This was my sighting.Not sure what it was but it was  no plane or helicpter or jet I have ever seen.  I live close by to Ellington Airforce base and Hobby airport and I am use to seeing planes,jets and helicopters that is not what it was that night.  I went in as the last one was going into the distance.  Went inside to call another witness to come outside withing sec or a min.  When we came out it was gone.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
2/13/2013    19:20  tx  5 minutes    satellite looking object with crazy turns;2013-02-13 19:20:00;5 minutes;2/13/2013    19:20  tx  5 minutes    satellite looking object with crazy turns A simple satellite looking object.  The same as you would look up and see a satellite flying that i have seen a hundred times before except it flew west to east then turning south for a minute the back east for a minute the southeast and curving back to north east until it was gone out of view.  This took place not in a small part of the sky it was the whole sky well over 100,000 feet and way too fast.   I am a faa certified mechanic and know planes don't fly that high and fast and satellites don't change course like this.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Falling light then vanished.;2013-08-13 18:30:00;3 minutes;Falling light then vanished My wife in I were drawn to the sky by thousands of birds flying above our apartment in some migratory pattern.  I ran to get my binoculars for a better look at the birds but when I got back outside, I immediately noticed a strange hovering light in the distance. To the naked eye it was an indistinguishable cylindrical light that appeared to be slowly falling from the sky.  Through the binoculars it had a more defined rigid shape that resembled a crescent moon with peak in its middle.  It fell for a minute or so then was gone from sight.  Almost immediately after it vanished a helicopter flew overhead in the direction of the sighting. My wife and both witnessed it and agreed that it was one of the most bizarre unexplainable objects we had ever seen.

Purple light hovering over field for over 2 hours.;2014-07-18 22:00:00;2+ hours;Purple light hovering over field for over 2 hours. There was a a  light which changed from a fluorescent purple to a reddish hue to a soft white, hovering above the field surrounded by I-45, Beamer Rd, Clear Lake City Blvd., and Dixie Farm Road.   It was much too tall to be a tower.  I believe the field there is owned by an oil company,  I think Exxon.  There has been a lot of activity there recently.   I wonder if this light was from a drone.

Object flies strait down and turns is lights off.;2014-10-03 22:16:00;30 seconds;Object flies strait down and turns is lights off. My friend and I were driving to dinner and we saw something that looked like a fireball falling strait down or of the sky. We thought it was a meteor until it slowed and two lights appeared as if it had wing lights, like a plane.  Then it blinked and disappeared. Planes don't fly strait down.  There was no sound.  No boom,  and no flash of light or explosion. It was as if it turned is lights off to avoid being tracked to a landing zone.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Same light seen by two persons 400 miles apart crossing from south horizon to northeast horizon in less than 1 minute.;2018-08-10 21:00:00;5 minutes;Same light seen by two persons 400 miles apart crossing from south horizon to northeast horizon in less than 1 minute. Was seen in Southern sky to the West of the Moon. Initially  stuck out as a very bright star, second star to the West of the Moon, as it was completely stationary at first. I was on the phone with my wife who was 400 miles away in Edinburg, Texas looking up at the Moon in the same sky. We both saw the bright stationary star-like light begin to move north east. It continued to move across the sky  over the house and and disappeared into the north east sky in about 30 seconds to a minute. We both saw it, from 400 miles apart. The light did not blink or flash.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
He stopped @ the end of my driveway,,, and said, Those bright light are not moving.;2018-09-01 21:10:00;~35 minutes;My neighbor walked out of my home after an evening of fellowship,,,, as we were saying our good-nights he stopped @ t My neighbor walked out of my home after an evening of fellowship,,,, as we were saying our good-nights  he stopped @ the end of my driveway,,, and said those bright light are not moving.   I joined him and said it must be a helicopter.  His reply was they do not go that high.  I asked ((male name deleted)) if he had any field glasses, he said yes and we both went to retrieve them,,,, meeting back within min's @ his driveway. What we both noticed was a cluster of bright powerful lights coming from the S/SW of Houston with the object not moving,,,,but, there was a small cluster of lights moving away in an westerly direction and from time to time return to the large cluster of bright lights.    The sky was clear w/o any clouds in the sky.  With him having serviced in the Air Force and I in the MARINES we both thought that the object was much higher than a military aircraft, or a commercial airliner, would be flying…;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Green lights moving quickly;2020-10-05 19:01:00;7 minutes;Green lights moving quickly I was driving down 288 South and my son saw some bright flashing lights in the distance to our left. We were headed Southbound and they were coming towards us northbound. He asked if one of the crafts was a helicopter and I observed the object have a bright green light with red and white flashing lights. Then I saw 2 other bright green lights moving towards us as well. I told him I thought they were drones. They then hovered in front of us to our left next to 288 North going freely lanes. I started to speed up to see if I could get closer. The 2 main green lights started flying over us and the bright green light with flashing red and white lights was trailing behind them. I moved my heard forward towards the windshield to see if I could see any plane or helicopter. All I saw was the green lights and nothing else. It was just pitch black object with green lights. They moved to our right in unison. 2 green lights in front moving very quickly and silent. I turn! ed the radio down to see if I could hear helicopter blades or jet engines. Nothing. It was silent. My son continued to watch them. I glanced again and they were miles away. Moving from east to west at a low altitude. The first 2 lights were moving quickly and the one with flashing lights was trailing behind. I dont know what I saw but never have I seen green lights in the sky and move that fast.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Video game controller shaped spaceship shoots across the sky early in the morning hours;2021-03-19 04:00:00;2 seconds;Video game controller shaped spaceship shoots across the sky early in the morning hours I was driving to Hobby Airport around 3:30 to 4:00 AM on the freeway. I immediately seen a flash of light in the sky, shaped like a game controller of sorts with bright lights on it. It looked surrounded in white light. It shot across the sky like a shooting star and disappeared into the clouds without a trace WITHIN seconds. I believe I seen blue lights on it as well. It moved so fast that I almost think I'm tricking myself into believing what I saw. I nudged my mother hurriedly, frantically asking did you see that? did you see that in the sky?! but she didn't. Only I did, and it was an amazing experience. It wasn't an actual shooting star either. No shooting star is shaped like a video game controller. It moved faster than the speed of light.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
