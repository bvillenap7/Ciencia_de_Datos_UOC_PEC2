As I went to work at 6 :15 am, passing over I -10 and  the Sam Houston Beltway West, South bound I saw what appeared to be an airplane ;2000-09-08 06:15:00;1.5 -2 mins;As I went to work at 6 :15 am, passing over I -10 and  the Sam Houston Beltway West, South bound I saw what appeared to be an airplane making a shallow left bank over the tollway.  As I closed in on the object heading south along the tollway, I noticed the object appeared to be an airplane heading into Androw Airport.  As I got closer to the object, I noticed it was larger than the normal size of aircraft for that airport, and it was stationary.  As I approached the object, instead of making a left turn into the airport, it remained stationary and became larger.  The object appeared as a cylinder with conical ends ending in very sharp points, and large red lights before the apex of the point on each end.  The object appeared to be tilted downward 10 degrees to the west.  As I faced the object, above the red light on the right side was a dimly lit dome.  On the left side above the other red light appeared to be a bright blue-white light similar to a spot light. The object looked  to be dark in color.  As I approched the object, my view was obscured as I passed under the vehicle. The size of the ufo was 150 feet in length and 15 to 20 feet in height.  It was one and one half times the size of a full moon.  It was approximately 1000-2000 feet above the tree line over a suburban area with no cellular towers  or other man made structures which could confuse the observer.  I am a geologist and have a working knowledge of areodynamics and physics. This object did not exhibit any properties which could be explained by natural or man made phenomena.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Videotaped a floating cylinder while taking pictures of planes leaving trails in the sky.;2000-09-14 07:51:00;20 min.;Videotaped a floating cylinder while taking pictures of planes leaving trails in the sky. I was taking pictures of planes spraying contrails {chemtrails} when I noticed an odd floating type cylinder, it appeared to rotate. I took some still photographs of the object but ran out of film. Plus I was shaking so bad I know those photos probably won't be that good. So I hauled butt upstairs and got the video camera. I got to film this object for at least three minutes before it passed over the roof of the townhome. The battery to the camera was dead so I had to use the ac adapter and film it out of the window. After it passed overhead I went downstairs and watched it for another five minutes. It floated and move very high in the sky and appeared to stop, but it continued to rotate. I could clearly see it rotate and change color from white to like a brownish color. I could have contiued to watch, but it was very sunny and my neck was hurting from looking up so long, so I went back inside. Later I was having a smoke out of the window when I noticed another plane leaving a trail in the sky I noticed high up to the west another of these strange objects, so I ran downstairs and tried to image that object as well. But it was too small and the camera would not focus on the blue sky. But I can verify it was the same thing, It was rotating and changing color like the other object, it might have been the same one. I saw it rotate to my left and it dissapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not understand how witnesses are able to distinguish the alleged chemtrails from genuine contrails.  However, this fact may not have any bearing on the other aspects of the report.  PD));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Rapidly moving silver cylinder crosses horizon of Houston;2001-08-04 23:25:00;20 seconds;Rapidly moving silver cylinder crosses horizon of Houston A silver cylinder, possibly emitting a yellow and silver exhaust, appeared from the southeast, which would include the Gulf of Mexico, and flew at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared over the horizon in the north northwest. Its course was parabolic and though its height was difficult to judge at night, it did not seem to be over six thousand feet up. It bore no resemblance to any aircraft, meteor or satelite that I had ever seen. I was on the porch of my house, which faces north, and looked up because I heard a strange muttering noise in the sky over the noise of the Saurday night traffic in West Houston. I yelled when I saw it and my daughter camr running out, but the object had already disappeared over the horizon,far faster than any helicopter could do it. The terrain is very flat down here and one can see quite a long way. My initial reaction was that it was a cruise missile, because it fit that profile. There were no news reports that I could find of this event the next day.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Large Cylinder with six orange (low-glow) lights moving slowly within 3 miles of IAH, heading toward IAH (Airport);2001-11-18 04:45:00;1.5 - 2.0 min.;Large Cylinder with six orange (low-glow) lights moving slowly within 3 miles of IAH, heading toward IAH (Airport) My Wife, Brother-in-law and myself had gotten together at our house to observe the Leonids together.  After watching the show for awhile, my Brother-in-law went to a Whataburger (or similar establishment which is open at that hour) because he had an appetite.  I'd seen enough and went inside - I was tired.  My Wife stayed outside, and several minutes later she came in the porch door asking me to come outside and see if I think this is part of the Leonids or not.  She didn't say what her opinion was.  I walked out, and she was pointing at it. At first I was focusing so far out that I seemed to just focus right past it.  Then she said pointed again, more deliberately.  At that time I saw it. At first it looked similar to some of the shots when that comet/meteor or whatever it was, broke up, in a line, then slammed one of our Planets a few years back.  I then saw that this column of lights was not descending nor were any of the parts fading. Then I realized it wasn't a naturally ocurring event. It is best described as a series of six (what must have been) large lights, orange in color with a brightness I can best describe as Low-Glow.  It was moving slowly and silently from the West when she first saw it, then by the time I got out there it had already begun South East. We both agree that there was a series of six lights.  She remembers round, but I remember them being that of an elipse. (Typical track and field) The lights all appeared to be spaced evenly front to back with the exception of the space in between the 3rd and 4th lights.  There was space there, of a size which was appr. that of the lights themselves.  Within that area, we each recalled dim, seemingly intermittent lighter-colored and smaller lights.  Like a dim,....very dim sparkler.  It was moving in such a way as to give the impression of an airliner in that, the lights were 1,2,3,4,5,6 all in a row with one being on the end it was travelling toward and on down the line, until one was at the trailing end.  I must say,...it certainly is! analogo us to a passenger craft, although no body or surrounding craft could be seen.  The way things were laid out however, a quick description of the light layout and the direction of travel was similar to the tubular design of a fuselage.  As we both stood silently watching,...it passed overhead at the appr. speed of a blimp,(no noise)with the look of a fuselage and the quietness of a bird.  It was a starry night and no structure was observed. We live within 3 - 4 miles of Houston Intercontinental Airport. I grew up around Eglin AFB and Pensacola NAS, spent 9 years in the Military, (4 USMC / 5 US ARMY SF) and am VERY familiar with military aircraft to include winning awards for same.  THIS WAS NO CONVENTIAL AIRCRAFT.  It flew silently over us, appr 1,500 feet to our North, (right over a certain Chevrolet Dealer very near I-45 and 1960, for you locals).  It is proving difficult to gauge the height since I do not know the size of the lights, although I'd say it was probably several hundred feet long. It did not appear to vary in altitude or speed. The lights seemed to be large.  It passed by us, heading toward the Airport, which is only 3 - 4 miles away (if that).  Eventually, we lost sight of it due to light-pollution. and our roof.  I am mailing sketches drawn by each of us without collaboration.   The only addition I have is that my Wife did say that when she initially saw it (before I did) it seemed to move like a snake, in that it was travelling level, then seemed to hit a bump which it simply made a quick humping motion with each of the six lights doing the same thing at the same spot.  Like a centipede walking over a twig.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Object had no wings or tail and made no sound. It appeared cylindrical and at times disc like. We saw it in daylight in a clear sky;2003-09-28 17:30:00;2 - 3 minutes;Object had no wings or tail and made no sound. It appeared cylindrical and at times disc like. We saw it in daylight in a clear sky I went outside with my daughter to take her roller skating. We turned the corner of the building and right away I saw this object in the sky. It was silver and was reflecting the sunlight. As soon as I saw it I was sure it was not a airliner - it had no wings or tail. It was traveling at a slow steady speed in a straight line traveling basically from North to South. I called my neighbor out and we watched it for a good three minutes. It would at times appear to me as a disc or a saucer and at other times it looked like a cylinder. There was no sound. Nothing. It continued on it's way at the same speed on the same course across the sky until it went out of sight. It was flying a little higher than the level of commercial aircraft in our area but it was clearly not high altitude. It wasn't an incredible experience but I would like to know how something like that could fly without wings or a tail. Or Sound. Oh and one last thing there was no wind and it was traveling to fast to be a balloon.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
UFO over Houston park;2004-04-08 23:17:00;10 seconds;UFO over Houston park I am a contract computer programmer working at a client's office.  I was walking out of the Marathon Oil tower at 11:17 pm CDT.  As I was saying goodbye to a security guard, a cylindrical object came down from the South East above a park across the street.  The security guard and I didn't see it until it was about 30 ft about the park because of a cover over the passenger dropoff point.  The object hovered above the park changing color from blue to white and blue again.  The object seemed to be made up of a single glowing light source.  There was absolutely no sound emitted from the object.  The hair stood up on my neck, and I looked at the security guard.  He was staring right at the object.  After I looked back at the object, it made its final color change and almost instantly lift back up into the sky.  We could not see where it went because of the cover on the passenger dropoff.  A few words were exchanged between us as we left.  I took a cab home that night rather than walking.  Now the security guard refuses to acknowledge this happened.  When I try talking about it, he says he doesn't know what I'm talking about. ((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the witness to have the other individual submit a report, as well.  We are awaiting a graphic from the witness, illustrating what it was he saw.  PD));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Two cylinder like objects;2007-02-03 16:53:00;unknown;Two cylinder like objects Mr. Davenport, I was simply playing with my Nikon 5.0 Mega pixel digital camera and caught two objects while I was inside my vehicle--taken through the front windshield of my vehicle while I was parked and facing east.  These two objects are above the back of the red stop sign (in the picture I will send you).  These objects are probably just balloons.  Using Microsoft Photo Editor, images on my computer automatically come up at 25%--however, one cannot see these images at 25%.  I then clicked enlargement up to 50% and saw two distinct objects above the back of the red stop sign.  (I did not, nor could not see these objects at all when I took this picture yesterday).  Probably just balloons, but since this picture was taken at 4:53 pm, and it would be dark in one hour, why is the, balloon, dark in the center?  I played with the gamma correction, and noticed these, balloons, were dark in the center and had a (white) structure at the top and bottom roughly in the form of a cylinder.  So if I am looking east, and the sun is setting behind me in the west, why are the balloons dark in the center?  It was an overcast day, so maybe this explains it, but I don’t see how.  Maybe balloons simply look like this--I have never photographed balloons.  I will now attempt to send this picture.  However, if it requires Microsoft Outlook, my computer is having major problems with this program, and I will not be able to send it this way.  I can only send it through my yahoo address as an attachment.  If this photo is of any interest, please contact me before publishing.  Regards;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Never seen anything like this;2012-08-28 20:00:00;1 minute;Never seen anything like this One cylidrical object. At the center of the object was a mid-section, measured about 1/10 of the total length.  The mid-section (perpendicular to the length) as the diameter of the mid-section was smaller by about 5%. The color was pristine, more pristine than polished stainless steel. The color was as close to looking like sterling silver crossed with mercury and appealing to the eye as I did not have to squint as I watched. It was a clear evening, blue sky with the moon in the background and the sun behind me. The level of the object was slightly parallel to the horizon with the forward slightly elevated. No sound, no wings, no propulsion system, no rudder, no lights and no exhaust fumes.  There was no reflection from the sun rays. Altitude was probably a consistant 200 feet above ground during flight. Distance from observer was probably less than one mile.
