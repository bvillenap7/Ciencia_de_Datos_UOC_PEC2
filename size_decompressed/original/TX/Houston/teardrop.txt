Blueish-Green Bright Light falling in the sky.;2006-09-21 02:30:00;5sec;Blueish-Green Bright Light falling in the sky. Perfectly clear night sky.  Driving west bound on I-10 I noticed a blueish-green bright shape high in the sky.  It appeared to be falling and as quickly as I noticed it it disappeared.  At first I thought it might have been associated with the recent shuttle landing, but too early in the morning.  Ive seen many natural lights in the sky, never anything like this.

Falling teardrop-looking light of different colors.;2012-06-24 23:00:00;a few seconds;Falling teardrop-looking light of different colors. My brother and I were playing soccer outside at night when we saw the thing fall. We looked up, and high above we saw something shoot by quickly, out of nowhere, and vanished in a few seconds, maybey two seconds. It was fast, but we saw its shape and color. It was a long streak like a teardrop, and while it shot by, we saw it turn blue, then red. But I'm mostly reporting this just to know if anyone else in the Houston area saw it that night.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
