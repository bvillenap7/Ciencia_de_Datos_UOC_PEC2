Sphere, No lights,  moving through neighborhoods above tree tops, over busy streets in Houston in 1980.;1980-10-10 19:00:00;3 min;Sphere, No lights,  moving through neighborhoods above tree tops, over busy streets in Houston in 1980. I would describe the sphere as being 2xlarger than a bowling ball, matt finish, with a cylinder on top with a short thin bar protruding from it, and around the circumference of the cylindar four thin anntennae.  It moved silently in a straight line and performed flawless angled turn of direction without change in momentum.  I believe it stayed on the same plane and speed was approximately the speed of a car going down a residential street.  The closest it came to me was perhaps 20 to 50 feet away.  It altitude was approximately 25 to 35 ft above the ground.   A flock of black birds split to fly around it.  When it reached my position it continued in another direction, approximately a 35 to 45 degree angle, until it was out of site.  I was alone, but it traveled over a very populated area and traffic.  Someone else has to have seen it.  I've written this today because I just read an entry of 2002 asking someone who may recognize a picture of a sphere found in the red clay in the woods near Huntsville, AL in 1984.  I saw my object in 1980, although I don't remember the day and exact time of my encounter.  It is similar to that, but with some noticeable differences.

Sighting in Houston;1987-07-15 13:00:00;25 min;Sighting in Houston I was sitting in a hospital parking lot waiting for a friend who was visiting his sick mother. I was watching cumulus clouds drifting by when I spotted an object hanging overhead. It appeared spherical and metallic and seemed as if covered by rust. It looked like a rusty ball bearing. It was hanging motionless at approx. 10,000 ft and was'nt drifting with the clouds like a balloon would do. I decided to keep my eyes on this thing to see what happened. It hung there for about 20 min. until an airplane came into view from behing me flying in its general direction.  The airplane appeared to be approx. 5000 ft below the object and did'nt seem to know it was there. As the airplane came nearer to being under the sphere the object began to move vertically and accelerated until it disappeared from view.

Bright green - blue sphere silently moving parallel to freeway.;1989-03-12 23:45:00;15 seconds;Bright green - blue sphere silently moving parallel to freeway. Two friends and I were driving to Hobby Airport (Houston's 2nd commercial airport) heading southbound on the Gulf Freeway (I-45) from downtown. It was raining slightly and foggy. About one mile south of the I-45 and Loop 610 Interchange, almost at the Hobby Airport exit, we all three saw a bright green sphere that moved parallel to the freeway, about 150-200 feet from the ground. It didn't make any sound. The object was almost in the clouds or fog and it cast a bright green glow in the fog and clouds directly over it. The object then changed direction it turned slightly left and crossed over the freeway, headed south-southeast (towards Clear Lake and the NASA headquarters). When it was on the other side of the freeway, we could also see a deep blue color on the lower 1/3 of the sphere, but the green glow was much brighter. It then disappeared in the clouds. In order to calm ourselves, we all assumed that this was a meteor or maybe an aircraft heading toward NASA that was partially obscured by the fog. This happened 10 years ago and I remember it as if it were yesterday. At the time this happened, all three of us were employed as clinical chemists at a major hospital located in the Texas Medical Center.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

OBJECT FLEW THROUGH T;1997-03-28 22:00:00;2 MIN;Summary : SMALL GLOBE, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A TENNIS BALL, ORANGE/GOLD IN COLOR.  SIGHTING WAS MADE AT NIGHT, WITH NAKED EYE.  OBJECT FLEW THROUGH THE TREE TO TOP OF THE HOUSE, HOVERED, CIRCLED ONCE AND FLEW AWAY. I was outside on the patio with the dog, talking to a friend on the phone.  From the corner of my eye, I spotted movement through the branches of the tree beside the garage, about twenty feet from me.  I turned to get a closer look.  There were no outside lights on, nor was there any light from the house spilling onto the paito or garage as none were on at the time.  As I turned, the object floated through the tree limbs to the top of the house visible from the patio.  It hovered there for a few seconds, then circled somewhat drunkenly as if determinig the direction to go.  It then flew over the house towards my neighbors house in a southwesterly direction. I was unable to track it futher as it was gone in an instant.  I described it to my friend as I watched it.The object was about the size of a tennis ball, perfectly round.  It had an orangey-gold glow, reminding me of the light a firefly gives off, but more yellow.  It was to large to be an insect.  I normally wear glasses for distance viewing, but did not have them on at that time, so the object was large enough for me to see without my glasses.  It was perfectly round.I am 47 years old, female and married.  At the time, I was home alone as my husband was in the hospital.  I have seen some things in the past that I could not explain, but never bothered to tell anyone for fear I'd not be believed.  However, this was REALLY strange.  I have not been able to come up with any explaination.  The evening was clear, as I'd seen the comet earlier and there were stars out.  There are not lights anywhere near where I saw this objcet.I do have a question that is not related to this:  Are there planes that fly low, rather large with bright lights that DO NOT MAKE A NOISE?  I have seen several over the past five months.  As we live near a large airport, I wondered if what I've been seeing is a plane or planes?  It's usually late at night, after midnight when I see these.  They are not the planet Venus, unless the plantet likes to fly very low over our neighborhood.  I repeat, there is absolutely NO sound before or after this plane or whatever, flies overhead.  It's the bright lights that get your attention.I would prefer your not contacting me as it would upset my husband who is not in good health.  Thank you.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I had been seeing a number of horizontal fire balls flying around from where I lived near the Medical Center, and was in the habit of looking up. There was a large opening in the canopy  between the old Live oak trees we were walking beneath, and all of a sudden I saw this huge object. It was just over the tree line, no more  than 100 feet above, and it flew directly over my head. It was the size of a house, matte black, spherical, mechanically  silent. The only sound it made was the sound of flames That we're shooting off of it, rather loudly. I actually heard the flames and looked  up just  before  it passed overhead. It was monumental, perfectly silent , and amazing to witness. it flew just overhead, and by the time I yelled at my wife to look up it had passed, and was obscured by the trees. A stunning sight.

Extremely bright spherical object about 40 degrees above the east-northeast horizon, about the size of a dime in the night sky.  Extrem;1999-07-15 22:15:00;30 seconds;Extremely bright spherical object about 40 degrees above the east-northeast horizon, about the size of a dime in the night sky.  Extremely bright central object, about 5x Venus as sets, spherical to oblong shape.  Surrounded by translucent, well-defined, glowing sphere.  No movement or sound. At end of observation, rotated in place and vanished (but more like it folded into the sky). Occupation of Observer: Casual evening walk Place of Observation: in the sky above our street, about 40 degrees above the eastern horizon (slightly east northeast) Distance of object from observer: about the altitude of a high-flying airplane (jet) Time in Sight: about 30 seconds total Speed: not moving (see description below) Direction of Flight: not moving (see description below) Tactics (unsual Motion): rotated in place then vanished (see description below) Sound: none apparent Size: total about the size of a dime in the night sky (see description below) Color: extremely bright white center surrounded by translucent glow (see description below) Shape: roughly spherical center surrounded by very sharply defined spherical glow (see description below) Odor Detected: none Apparent Construction: na Exhaust Trails: sort of an afterglow after object vanished, but more like motion in the atmosphere (see description below) Weather Conditions: clear, no moon (young crescent, already set), no clouds, warm (but comfortable), relatively dry Effect on Clouds: na Sketches or Photographs: sketch Manner of Disappearance: rotated in place but more like folding into sky and vanished with afterglow (see description below) Additional Notes and Comments: Let me say that I am a skeptic -- not necessarily about extraterrestrial life but about the possibility of them finding us or vice versa given distances, relativity, etc.).  This was such a vivid experience that felt compelled to report it in the hopes that someone else had a similar experience.  I noticed the object when I turned to walk back to our home (I was with our 2 cats the object was too distant and noiseless, therefore they were not disturbed).  The object may have been in place longer than my observation.  The entire object was about the size of a dime, in total, in the night sky.  Center was large (about 5x the magnitude of Venus as it sets), bright, roundish to oblong object.  This central object was surrounded by a sharply defined spherical glow.  This glow was extremely clear and distinctive against the dark sky.  It was as if there was a very fine line of bright light around the spherical glow, but it was more evident above the central object than below it.  The entire thing was a round shape like a ball with about 2/3 of it the glow (translucent) and 1/3 the extremely bright central object.  I got a really good look at the object for several seconds because it was not moving.  Then, it was as if it rotated in place and vanished (more like it folded into the sky).  I felt that I could see sort of an afterglow but it was more like the atmosphere was moving (perfectly cloudless night, so this motion seemd to be in the atmosphere itself I am less clear about this portion of the siting).  Honestly, in all of my life I have never, ever seen anything like this.  I regret I had no witness (at least with me) since my husband, who usually accompanies me on our evening walks, was not present.  The entire experience was absolutely vivid (I can recall it as if on video-tape).  In other useful information: I am well educated in the natural sciences (biology/geology) final degree is Ph.D., social science I was an airplane pilot for many years so am familiar with atmospheric phenomena.  I ! was perfectly alert, on no medication.  On April 11, I witnessed in roughly the same quadrant of the sky at about the same time in the evening an object that I would explain as a meteor, only at a much lower altitude and much larger in magnification than a typical meteor, so that it was unusual in that expect.  The meteor was low enough and large enough for me to clearly see an orange-red hot core and the cinder trail.  I noticed it from just about overhead in our driveway and watched as it moved steadily across the entire remainder of the sky down toward the northeastern horizon.  While this was also a vivid observation, and it has been on my mind, it is explainable and I do not believe that it biased my observation last evening in any way.  I do hope that if anyone else reports a similar experience to the one I had last evening in Texas that I will hear about it (checked box for return contact by investigator).  I would like to know how to obtain any information on events that may have been in my area (weather balloons, high altitude explosions, satellites, etc.).;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Four withe esferic objets over the skies of Houston;1999-09-10 22:30:00;30 seconds;Four withe esferic objets over the skies of Houston I came out from a restaurant in the Galleria area of Houston, standing outside and wating for the valet to bring my car I saw four flat white objets in an imperfect arrow formation, like ballons floating in the sky about 30 miles per hour, suddenly they changed patterns following the lider and creating  like an eight. They accelerated at tremendous speed (no sound) in their own rect pattern until disapear. I pointed out to the sky, and my companion and one of the valets saw the event.We are absolutly convinced that the shapes andthe tremendous acceleration of the objets are out of this world. Later I called the Air Force Base at Ellington Field and told them that is the matter of national security to investigate this events, they told me they don't have a procedure to register or investigate this events. I am really worry that this country is not taking seriously this events, I saw what I saw with my own eyes, and I think is to much arrogance that extra-terrestrials vessels come and go with impunity.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Bright green sphere hovering then accellerating exponentially.;2000-01-01 21:35:00;10 sec;Bright green sphere hovering then accellerating exponentially. A very bright green light seemed to be hovering south of my location. It it appeared as an aircraft light, but 3 to 5 times larger, if the craft was about 700-100ft in altitude and approximately 1 mile south. The light did not flash, flicker, or streak. After 3-5 seconds of what seemed to be a hover to a slight North to South movement, it then seemed to either move drastically from North To South, or fall in an arc to the Earth. In less than five seconds it had faded to nothing, over the tree line. At first I thought a shooting star. I have seen 20+ shooting stars. Again, I emphasize, this thing did not flicker at all, nor did it streak.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

While taking-off in a 737, I saw an object that looked like a large chrome ball-bearing sitting above a cloud bed.;2000-03-16 09:00:00;3 SECONDS;While taking-off in a 737, I saw an object that looked like a large chrome ball-bearing sitting above a cloud bed. On 03/16/2000, I was taking off from George Bush Intercontinental Airport in a commercial Boeing 737 bound for Cancun, Mexico.  As the plane climbed, I was engaged in my usual habit of looking downward, watching the ground as it gradually grew smaller and smaller.  We then began climbing through random layers of clouds. So my view of the outside would become white-washed with clouds for several seconds at a time, followed by periods of clear to semi-clear visibility.   At one point in our ascent, while continuing to look downward, the visiblity became completely clear.  At this point, my eyes shifted and locked-on what appeared to be a metallic ball- shaped object, positioned at about 2:00 & 100 ft below us.  It seemed to be stationary, sitting just above a lower cloud bed. The object looked like a large, (about 6 feet in diameter) glistening ball bearing with no seams or wings that I could see.  The object didn't appear to be moving, as I remember turning my head to track it as we passed.   I tracked it to about 4:30, when we hit another cloud bank and my window went white.  I quickly looked at those around me, but could tell that they hadn't seen anything.  I don't really think they could have where they were seated and I wasn't about to get up and start asking everyone seated at a window, Excuse me sir/maam, Did you happen to see the large chrome ball floating outside the plane just a moment ago.   At first, I'm thinking that this might just have been some sort of weather related equipment that they use around airports.  Then I start thinking how dangerous this would be to planes landing and taking off, especially concealed in cloud cover as it was.  I thought about talking to the pilots, but just blew it off.   As the years passed, I kept thinking back on what I had seen.  I've called NASA several times over the last few years, just to see if they could maybe identify the object as man-made based on my description.  Every time, I would be prompted to leave a recorded message.  I was about to, but then started getting a little wary.  Wouldn't want any wacko files opened up on me or anything.  Maybe you can help identify what I saw, man-made or otherwise.  It would seem rather small to be occupied, but who knows. Thanks.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Silver sphere the size of a VW bug seen in the northern sky of downtown Houston Texas for about 30 min moving in different directions.;2000-09-19 11:50:00;30 min;Silver sphere the size of a VW bug seen in the northern sky of downtown Houston Texas for about 30 min moving in different directions. On Tuesday Sept 19 at 11:50 am I looked into the northern sky and saw a silvery shining sphere or ball dancing in the sky. Iam located in downtown Houston Texas. It moved in 4 or 5 directions and was very shiny. The sky was clear with good sun. At one point a Southwest Airlines jet looked like it was going to hit the sphere. The event lasted about 30 min. I took pictures and called the Houston Police Dept and was told it was a weather ballon. It moved from very fast, to slow, to still. It seemed to continue to move to the north until out of site. I also looked at it with 60x28Mc field glasses. It was round 3d and very shiny or spinning possibly. It moved very smoothly, not in a jerking fashion. There were quite a few jet contrails in the sky and thats what made me look up. Those contrails have been occuring alot lately. I am a professional with a college degree and generally clear headed. I have never seen a Ufo before. I am 38 yrs old. It was probably less than a 2 miles from me when this began. In comparison to the Southwest Airlines Jet it was about the size of a VW bug.

Small reddish spherical object that flashed red at varying intensities and intervals and that seemed to slightly wobble laterally;2004-02-08 17:45:00;20 minutes;Small reddish spherical object that flashed red at varying intensities and intervals and that seemed to slightly wobble laterally Spotted an object near the northwest corner of the 610 loop around Houston. It was small and hard to determine the altidude. It seemed to drift slowly to the south then to the south east. The object appeared to be small and round. It seemed to wobble or spin. It flashed a firey red light at an irregular interval. Sometimes the light was quick and dim. Other times it seemed to flare up. As it slowly drifted over the building I lost sight of it an so left my office to go downstairs to see if I could catch it on the other side of the building. When I came outside and looked around it was gone. However at the same time I looked south and saw a single military aircraft moving untypically fast from the direction of Ellington Field an moving WNW. It seemed to be 3-5 miles to the south. The plane then went west and I think did a U-turn back toward the east. I would note however that President Bush is in town tonight for a fund raiser. That's it. I don't know what it was. It was NOT a plane or helicopter. It seems like it could possibly heve been a baloon of some kind but the flashing was wierd - unless it has an irregular surface that was spinning and possibly reflecting light from the sunset in the west. Plausible - but I just can't say. It was certainly unusual enough to get and hold my attention. I took 3 digital photos but they don't show much more than a small reddish dot. I really wish I had a bigger zoom. Will email you the images that I have in seperate email;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Colored spheres fly over Houston Texas!;2006-05-03 22:00:00;20 sec;Colored spheres fly over Houston Texas! On this night i saw two seperate objects. The first one caught my eye as it flew directly over me at an unknown altitude. I live about eight miles from IAH airport. I watch the planes as they take off and land on a nightly bases. If i had to estimate the the speed and altitude, I would say they were about the same altitude as the planes as they fly over, but moving at a higher speed about double the speed of the planes as they take off. Moving from south to north this object flew directly over me and was straight above me when i noticed it. It was a pinkish orange in color, appeared to be spherical in shape although it also seemed to have more of a globular shape. The color was strange because Ive never seen a object this color. Almost as if it was a thick translucent color. Completly silent as it moved at a steady speed until it vanished into the horizon. As i stood there trying to figure out what that was. A few minutes later another one came into view moving at about the same altitude and speed as the first one. This second one was a little darker in color more of an orangish red. Moving this time from east to west. Now a person could say that since i live close to the airport that they were planes. These were not planes! They were completly silent, They were of a solid color by that i mean they were not flashing or strobing like the planes do. And these were not just lights either. You could actually see a a shape, almost as if they were lit from the interior with no exterior lighting.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

I was at a apprx. 45 degree angle to the object.  As the object approached closer over head it appeared to be in a haze.  What was really unusal about this is the way it flew, the object was flying straight but was violently zigzagging back and forth as it flew.  As I watched in awe as it passed me it split into two spheres.  The second shpere shooting off of it's port side and to the North, the second object quickly did a loop around the first, returned to it's original position of being just off the port side of the first and both objects proceeded and disappeared into the night.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Usually I look up at the night sky when im on my nightly dog walking trip, just in case something happens to fly by.  Usually I might catch a shooting star, or an airplane but nothing out of the ordinary.  But this night, it seems I looked up at exactly the right time.  When I looked up, a falling spherical object caught my eye.  It was a whitish-blue and looked to have yellowish sparks as a kind of tail.  It just kinda appeared mid-air (well out of thin air I guess you could say), not very high in the sky. I tried to follow it to see if it would make contact with the ground, but when it fell behind the treeline of the wooded area next to my apartments (beyond my line of vision, hindered by the trees) there was just a bright white flash, as if it had exploded.  There was no sound or anything though.  Not sure what it was...could have been some kind of falling space junk or just a small meteorite.  Unfortunatly I didnt have my digital camera at the time, or else I could have taken a picture.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

small sphere above downtown Houston;2007-10-05 12:00:00;2 hours;small sphere above downtown Houston I work on the 39th floor of an office building in downtown Houston. For 2 hours now been watching a small round object approximately 10 miles away in the sky. If I hold my hand up, it is about half the size of my pinky nail. It will remain motionless for 15 or so minutes then drop to the ground suddenly. It will then circle around different buildings for a little while. Then it moves back to its same position in the sky and remain motionless (moving back up right now). NOT A BALLOON! A balloon doesnt stay still, drop, circle, and move back to its original position.  It is an overcast day here in Houston. The sun is not piercing these clouds at all. The 2nd time the object dropped down, it was about 3 miles away. It settled about 100 feet above the ground and then lit up so brightly that it hurt my eyes from this far away. The light was incredibly bright. It was like the tip of a blowtorch or when you are magnifying the sun through a magnifying glass. A coworker saw this and said it might be a helicopter. No sooner than she had said that that the object stopped glowing and shot straight up to about eye level and hovered. It then continued its routine of dropping every 15 minutes or so.

My video was the only one used.   Anyway I can’t say that it was alien but it was not in our atmosphere I could tell by how it captured the suns light. I you have any questions you can contact me by email. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

lit circle travling south to north across sky in 10-15 seconds in houston;2008-07-13 21:15:00;10-15 seconds;lit circle travling south to north across sky in 10-15 seconds in houston i've been looking up a lot lately, with the new purchase of a 6 telescope. If you had any reports from Houston last night (July 13 2008) of an object traveling directly northbound, I saw an unidentifiable object. Bare eyes, no scope obviously. Completely circular, traveling straight north. (I am on the west side of houston texas). This object seemed to be uniformly spherical, it seemed to have a glow to it, but not a bright one. But it was a consistently uniform light. The light did not change brightness, did not have any sort of beacon or blinking as a plane or copter would. And It seemed to move from the southern most point of the horizon to the northern most pointin about 10-12 seconds. (this has to be an incredibly fast speed, as planes and jets take many minutes to pass the entire sky. Definitely not a satellite, as they are much slower. And definitely not a meteorite as I have seen many, and they seem to disappear half way across or down the skyline w/ a greenish color. I have been looking to the sky's for many of years for something regardless, and I told my wife, that if i had ever seen a ufo in my life, that last night was it. She just thinks I'm crazy.  Are you the one guy who takes reports from his home in washington or something like that, the guy I saw on tv. I never thought I would contact you thinking I saw an anomaly like this. This is a serious inquiry. (report);29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Round bright light.;2013-11-05 17:30:00;15 seconds;Round bright light. This was taken by a co-worker on way home from work in Houston Texas on Beltway 8 two weeks ago.  He did not see the round bright object when he took the picture because he was driving at the time and only pointed and clicked twice.  What made him take the picture was the round cigar shape cloud in the upper left of the picture because it pierced the cloud in the center of the picture.   This picture was taken with an I Pad while he drove.  This was about 5:30 PM during Daylight Savings Time.   Picture on right was first picture and the left was the second picture taken.  The sun was to the bottom left of the picture and this was taken pointing to the West.  The other interesting thing about the bright object is that it has a contrail behind it so you can’t say it’s the sun reflecting off the I Pad lens.  He didn’t notice the bright object until he showed his wife the pictures later.  (I will submit the 2 pictures) taken;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Shape is sphere like I was on my balcony smoking a cigarette when these bright blue, red, and white lights appeared.  I took video.  The object made noise kinda loud and made a triangle like pattern around my neighborhood and is currently flying around still.  It sounds like it might be running out of fuel.  Keeps making a sound like a plane trying to take flight.  Object looked sphere like and like a plane on its side.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Red ball-like aircraft spotted from private aircraft.;2016-02-15 17:00:00;15 seconds;Red ball-Like aircraft spotted from private aircraft.  I was flying in my airplane from California and just as we started our decline I looked out the window.  Maybe 50 yards from the wing of the plane was a red ball like orb flying.   It was traveling extremely fast then down shifted and zig zagged before it sped off extremely fast past the tail of the plane.  The ball looked maybe the size of a beach ball.   We were definitely too high in the air for it to be a balloon or drone, not to mention the very strange way it was flying, as if it was observing the airplane I was in.

Crystalline-colored orb near airport (not in a flight path).;2016-10-14 19:44:00;15 minutes;Crystalline-colored orb near airport (not in a flight path). I lived near an airport for a couple of years.  Planes and helicopters were something I was used to, and I had come to learn the flight patterns and pathways, how each craft looked, what lights it displayed, how it traveled, etc. At IAH the planes never come from the West, as they only enter and exit going North or South, with a quick, sharp turn here or there.  And you could always hear them since we lived right across from the airport.  The planes took off straight over the apartment (could feel the walls vibrate sometimes).  That’s how I knew this was something strange. After dinner one evening, I let my dog outside to do her business.  I was standing out there watching her, when I looked in the sky and saw a floating, white orb on the West side (almost directly across from me), above the treetops.  It almost looked like a star, but was too big, too bright, and too close to convince me of such.  It had a shine to it like a diamond.  It was NOT solid white, and the “shine” would get brighter and then dim back down. If I had to guess, it wasn’t but a few miles from me.  There was no sound, and it wasn’t stationary.  It very slowly travelled left to right to left to right again.  The object also staggered in movement, and moved up and down as well.  Which then convinced me this was no star or planet, since the Earth travels in a directional orbit.  Aside from that point, even during the clearest weather, it’s extremely difficult to see stars when you live in the city, especially in a city as big as Houston. This sighting lasted for about 15 minutes until I got a strange feeling that I was being watched.  I became so weirded out that I went back inside.  I later (don’t remember what time) mustered up the courage to go back outside, and the orb was gone.  But there was now a helicopter (with an obvious red-blinking light on the tail) looking around the same area with a spotlight. It circled around the area several times, moving its spotlight around, as if searching for something. I have never seen anything like it since then.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Bright white sphere high in the morning sky, illuminating light grows in size, then vanishes in an instant.;2017-09-08 08:45:00;2-3 minutes;Bright white sphere high in the morning sky, illuminating light grows in size, then vanishes in an instant. I was traveling to work along Beltway 8 East in Houston, TX, this morning, Friday, 9/8/17, at 8:45am, and noticed an extremely bright light high in the clear blue sky.  The illuminating light was spherical and grew in size, somewhat changing shape, then decreased in size, then completely disappeared in an instance.  It did this three times within a period of 3 minutes or less.  It definitely was not an airplane there was never any definite shape that formed, no white trail of smoke, no clouds around it, no sound (though it was very high in the sky).  I called my husband immediately to share what I had seen, as I was perplexed as to what it could be and very excited, it sounded like other UFO sightings I’ve heard described.   I’m trying to find out if there are other local reports of people witnessing the same thing.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Clouds in the sky and I looked up enjoying the breeze and silence due to us moving away from an airport and saw it.  It was there in the sky about 3× the size of a star you'd see looking up at night.  The sphere zoomed left then right and left again.  I've never seen such a thing before in my life.  I looked down due to a temporary distraction and looked back up and saw it zoom off after than anything ive ever seen in my life.  I'm not one to believe in these things but this spooked me.  There's no manned aircraft in the world that can do what this one did...;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Spherical Orb UAP/UFO 11-7-2020 Houston, TX Video;2020-11-07 18:00:00;5-7 minutes;Spherical Orb UAP/UFO 11-7-2020 Houston, TX Video UAP/UFO Sighting on 11/7/2020 in EaDo Houston, TX  When: 11-07-2020 event began at approx. 6 pm at dusk  Weather: Clear, no major clouds  Camera and Vantage Point: iPhone SE (2nd Gen) with digital zoom, recorded from a nearby 5th floor rooftop. The UAP was observed flying over Hwy 59 in front of the Marriott Marquis Hotel located at: 1777 Walker St, Houston, TX 77010  UAP description: Shape: perfect sphere with metallic finish Lights: glowing or pulsating or brightening/dimming light which seemed to turn on and off or turn away from view while the UAP was perhaps turning. Sound: It emitted no discernable noise. There was background noise heard in the video of traffic 2 blocks away on a raised freeway. Size: I was able to compare the size while it was flying over moving cars just below it on Hwy 59. It was between the size of a small hatchback and a mid-sized SUV or sedan. Acceleration Speed: Silent and high speed acceleration much faster than known aircraft able to hover can move such as a helicopter or a V/STOL fixed wing aircraft like an F-35 or Sea Harrier jet.  What was observed just before the recording started: At about 6 pm, I was in awe trying to decipher what it was I was witnessing. This extremely bright and pulsating/glowing on/off spherical craft making no noise was making uncanny aerobatics, quickly zipping away into the background out of sight beyond even more buidings downtown. At this point the light seemed to go completely off and I was able to observe the perfectly spherical shape with my naked eye. Within only a few seconds, it zipped back into view closer to my position, once again above Hwy 59 at an altitude of approximately 450-600 feet. I estimated this based off of the fact that the craft was slightly to the right of the 28 story Marriott from my vantage point and just above the rooftop. After the 45-60 second aerial demonstration (unrecorded), the UAP moved closer to my position while moving to my left at which point I started recording. Some moments of particular interest in the video are when the light is see! n to get much brighter and when you can see the brown colored elevator shaft of the building I was on in frame with the orb and how it moves rather quickly to the left just before disappearing out of view behind the building.  Observers: Primary observer is myself and I am a 40-year-old male with a degree in marketing who works in sales in the oil and gas business in Houston, TX. Interests include learning to pilot fixed wing aircraft as well as rotary wing aircraft. When I was around 12 years old living in Brisbane, Australia, I saw what seemed to be an airplane flying along the horizon make an instant 90° turn launching straight into space at extremely fast rates. This was my only other UFO experience.  Secondary observer is my wife, a 28-year-old Argentine female who was distracted and editing TikTok videos on her iPhone while listening through her AirPods.  Conclusion: I have always admired aircraft my whole life so I have some good knowledge about helicopters, airplanes, and drones. I cannot identify what it was I saw and the most likely thing it could be is a drone. I have never seen a car-sized drone perfectly shaped sphere able to emit no noise. I am a logical person I can only conclude this is a secret government aircraft or something not of this planet.
