Saucer flew over house in Houston;1970-05-01 03:00:00;5-10 Minutes;Saucer flew over house in Houston It was on a pleasant night,and my windows facing the west were open. Intercontinental Airport had opened the year before and I was very familiar with the landing routes of the airplanes.. I was looking at the few stars I was able to see when I saw a very bright star APPROACHING from the west. It grew larger by the minute with lights becoming visible all around the structure.  I remember that they were green and red and I seem to remember an amber light on the bottom of the structure. It was a silverish saucer-shaped craft, moving at an unbelievably slow pace, no more than a mile or two an hour with absolutely no sound at all! As it was almost directly overhead of our house, I jumped up and woke my younger sister, practically ripping her out of the bed, dragging her to the window so that she would also see it. She was groggy but amazed. I jumped up from the floor by the window and ran down the hall and out the back door. I stood on the back door step and watched it maintain its slow pace overhead, heading due east, directly in the path of JFK Blvd and the FAA!! As it slowly proceeded that way, I ran back inside to the telephone to see if I could get the number to the FAA so that they could witness this also.  I was so nervous that I dropped the phone and my father got up. I tried to get him to go outside to see if it was still visible, but he sent me to bed. This has stuck with me all my life.. I will never forget it. I dont know how long I was outside observing it, but it was a huge saucer, perhaps 125 ft across with maybe an altitude of less than 200ft. My sister for years had denied seeing it, but now we discuss it openly as she has seen unusual things in Mississippi where she now lives.. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date is approximate.

Saucer very low to ground;1970-06-15 03:00:00;15 minutes;Saucer very low to ground I was gazing out of open window facing the west. I noticed a bright object moving east toward me. Intercontinental Airport is directly to the east of our house, and I was used to the flight patterns of the airplanes and it was not in an approach position. It was very slow moving, getting brighter and larger as it approached. I awaken my younger sister (16 at that time) and pulled her to the window. The object was a saucer shaped object with lights surrounding it (amber and green), with no sound at all. The window was open and it was a very still night. It moved directly over our house, was bigger than 2 houses put together and was very low in the sky. I ran out of the back door and stood on the steps and watched it moving directly toward the FAA on Kennedy Blvd. It was the slowest moving airborne object I have ever seen. I went back inside to call the FAA to notify them, dropped the phone and awakened my Father who would not go outside to see if he could see it. He sent me to bed... My younger sister and I have never stopped talking about this... Either of us could be notified.. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, we assume.  PD));29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Perfect disk with lights on edge one side red, one side green: no sound No clouds, disk blocked out stars, moving S.to N.;1973-04-05 21:30:00;30 seconds;Perfect disk with lights on edge one side red, one side green: no sound No clouds, disk blocked out stars, moving S.to N. This happened in, or around, April of 1973.  I remember that it was close to my birthday.  The weather was mild and cloudless.  I think it was a Saturday night because my parents were out.  I was almost 12, a well read and responsible kid, with no more than a passing interest in the unknown. For some reason, I went out to my front yard (the house was in the 2500 block of Southgate Blvd, Houston,TX,77025)and looked straight up.  At that moment a large disk (red lights on one side, green lights on the other, not shiny, totally silent)passed directly overhead, blotting out the stars as it passed.  It moved in a straight line over my house towards the north and I watched it until it was out of sight:  total only about 30 seconds.  As it moved away it appeared to be completely flat, and not very thick: a true disk, like a discus or a coin.  Oddly, I wasn't alarmed.  I didn't tell my parents or anyone at school.  And I pretty much forgot about it until around 1981. I know this was not the Goodyear blimp I had seen the blimp at night in our part of the city before.  The shape was wrong, and the blimp was far from silent at that altitude. The disk was well above tree height, in that neighborhood of tall pine trees.  My closest guess on the size and altitude would be 100' across and 1000' off the ground. I am hoping that others may have seen this.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Witnesses saw a bluish-white-light emitting spherical object on the ground a few feet from the edge of a feeder road alongside IH45 So.;1975-01-04 22:40:00;approx 1 min.;Witnesses saw a bluish-white-light emitting spherical object on the ground a few feet from the edge of a feeder road alongside IH45 So. I was driving north on IH45 So. from Galveston to Houston the first Sunday in January 1975.  My mother, 12 yr old brother, 6 year old son, and 3 yr old niece were with me.  We had been visiting my grandparents and had left at 10:00 pm.  (THE TIME IS VERY IMPORTANT.  WE ALWAYS LEFT AT 10PM BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN MY GRANDPARENTS WATCHED THE 10:00 NEWS AND IT WAS OUR SIGNAL TO GO HOME.)  At that time I always drove in the right or slower lane.  It was clear - no rain or fog.  We were coming to the exit to Ellington AFB which was approx. 2 miles to our right or east of the freeway.  I saw a well-lit object on the ground to our right and pointed it out to my family.  I pulled onto the shoulder and was trying to talk my brother into getting out with me to take a closer look.  My mother became hysterical and insisted I get back on the highway and so I did.  No one else stopped during this time, although I could see cars coming in the opposite direction from Houston and on the exit overpass. At that time, the area was not developed as it is now.  It was mostly used for cattle to roam about and feed on.  An almost continuous barbed wire fence about 4 ft high ran alongside the feeder road about 10 feet from the curb.  The fencing had been there for years.  The object was in front of a small grove of trees on the opposite side of the fence from us.  We could see the upper part of it but not the bottom and I am assuming this was because of the uncut grass and bushes that usually grew up alonside the fence.  The object was about 20 ft wide and 10 ft high.  It emitted a bluish-white light from the entire object.  I could tell it was round because the light was rotating in a counterclockwise pattern (my left to right as I viewed it), reflecting off the treetops when it got to the most extreme right of the object and before it reappeared on the left.  The best comparison I can make is that of a lighthouse.  I could make out rectangles set longside down, rounded edges rather than squared off, and set within a thin frame.  Each was the height of the object and several feet long.  The entire object emitted this light and in addition, each rectangle got extra bright in the counterclockwise sequence, one after the other.  This was also apparent when the light was reflecting off the trees.  We didn't hear any sounds, but we had our windows rolled up.  That's about it!;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Awakened by hovering disk over residential area.;1982-07-03 00:00:00;20-30 minutes;Awakened by hovering disk over residential area. Many years ago, absolutely sober, I was awakened around midnight by a strange whirring sound outside my bedroom window.  I walked over to the window, opened the sheer curtains, and saw very clearly a disc-shaped UFO with 6-8 multi- colored lights hanging beneath the disk. The colored lights alternated their lighting pattern, as if spinning in a slow circle.  The sound matched the moving lights.  The ship wasn't doing anything other than hovering above the rooftops.  I tried to wake up my spouse verbally, to no avail.  I didn't dare leave the window.  After what seemed like an eternity, I finally did walk across the room to try again to rouse my spouse.  Unsuccessful, I returned to the window, only to find it was gone.  I watched the news reports for days for any similar reports, as sightings were common in the Texas Gulf Coast area.  But no one has ever confirmed this sighting to me.  My life changed after that point, though.  Strange, albeit harmless phenomenon continue to follow me even to this day.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Sighted silver disk in motion on a cloudless, sunny day.;1993-07-01 15:00:00;10 secods;Sighted silver disk in motion on a cloudless, sunny day. I was walking down the street, and noticed the disk in the sky above the horizon by perhaps 30 degrees.  The direction was northwest of my location, in northwest Houston.  It was fairly far away, in my estimation around 2 miles.  The object may have been cylindrical in shape, or disk-shaped but on edge.  I believe it to be the latter.  I would estimate its diameter at roughly 200'.  It was gray in color, or maybe a matte silver like brushed steel.  The object was moving northeast (?) at about 400 ft/s, not very fast.  After observing the object in flight for around 10 seconds, I found that I could no longer locate it. I am a college student, 19.  At the time of this event, I was 13, but I never thought to report it until now, despite my interest in UFOs.  My memory may be sketchy concerning some details, but my recollection of the overall event is accurate.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
Beautiful silver-colored flying saucer about the size of a round 18 wheeler with turquoise lights around perimeter seen.clearly in '97.;1997-09-15 00:00:00;5 minutes;Beautiful silver-colored flying saucer about the size of a round 18 wheeler with turquoise lights around perimeter seen.clearly in '97. I was coming from a clinic where I got an x ray of my sternum which showed a damaged lung.  Looking for decent air and water, I wound up at about the end of Wilcrest across highway 6? unless it was 8. I sat awhile facing east I think at a little dead end.  Suddenly I saw one flying disk about the size of an 18 wheeler, but round, glide across my field of vision.  I think it was going north to south.  I didn't hear anything but suddenly there was moisture on my face and I couldn't breathe.  So I opened my window so I could.  There were also miniature star balls on the ground and one full sized, I think, overhead.  I thought, I knew there was something like this. I thought I'd been ((sprayed)) on by the frightened star ball.  Don't know.   I left before the disk was out of sight.  I was afraid I would pass out from the sternum-lung pain and left.  Also, I am on a mental disability and I thought if I try to tell anhhhhhhhyone about this, they'll call me crazy and hurt me more.   I went home and went to bed in pain.  I don't know what time it was. It was before I could fall asleep.  The bedroom had windows with transparent curtains and I saw probably a camera with a turquoise light I could see at about the height of a man.  [The disk had a circle of turquoise lights around it's perimeter.]  I don't remember it rotating or anything.  Just gliding.  I think it was friendly but not sure.   I suspected later, this disk was back engineered from whatever happened at Roswell. ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I spoted a copper/amber colored object moving from the se to the west. Observed it through a telescope. Seen a cluster of 15 to 20 disk;1999-12-19 01:15:00;5 minutes;I spoted a copper/amber colored object moving from the se to the west. Observed it through a telescope. Seen a cluster of 15 to 20 disk shaped objects. I am an amateur astronomer. I started observing the night sky with my telescope Saturday night, 12/18/99, around 22:30 pm central standard time. Observing location was SW Houston at my place of residence. At approximately 01:15 am central standard time on 12/19/99 I noticed a object moving across the sky with the naked eye. At first glance it looked like a commercial airliner because the speed was about the same. But there was no sound and no blinking lights.  The light was constant with no fluctuation and was copper/amber in color. The object was coming from the southeast and moving toward the west. I was facing the south and looking up.  The object was at about 75 to 80 degrees.  This made me curious as to what the object was. I swung my telescope around and was able to lock onto the object with my 9X50 finder scope. Then I focused my finder scope.  At that point I could tell the object was not an airplane or jet liner. I could make out multiple disc shaped objects all clustered closely together. At that point I lined up the objects in my Astro-Physics 130 mm telescope.  I had to refocus because I was previously observing the moon. I had to bring the focus in closer because the object was definitely closer to earth. My telescope was set up with a 22mm panoptic eyepiece.  This was giving me about 35 times magnification.  I tracked and observed the object across the sky.  There was 15 to 20 disc-shaped objects. They were like bubbles that had been partially flattened. They were dark and transparent looking in the middle of the discs.  The discs were emitting an amber colored light around the outer edge and it was constant and nonfluctuating.  Some of the objects held a steady position as they moved across the sky while others swayed back and forth. All of the discs were of the same size.  I followed them as far as I could to the west util my view was obstructed by a tree. By then the discs were very dim. The cluster stayed together for the duration of my observation.  After I lost site of the objects, ! I contin ued to observe the night sky for another hour.  There was no other objects sited during that time.  I took my compass and lined it up with the direction my telescope was pointed at the last site of the objects.  The compass reading was 275 degrees.  This is almost due west.  A this point I started writing down what had transpired since I had never seen anything like this before.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Disc shaped object spotted hovering over a house in Winchester Country subdivision in northwest Houston.  Object was metallic and reflecting the sun. The object was observed from a distance of approx. 100 yards and about 50 feet above the house. It remained motionless for about 60 seconds, then it quickly darted off in a westerly direction.  The disc had a bright glow beneath it.  A black helicopter, with no markings, was observed in the area shortly after the sighting.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
It was doing something on the woods, mostly because of the cows.;2000-03-01 23:00:00;5 minutes;It was doing something on the woods, mostly because of the cows. My cousin and her boyfriend took us to the corner of the street were we live.  As soon I saw the street saw a disk like shape that look to have like a hill on top of it.  It was real big. It had green lights around it in the middle just turning on and off.  It just kept hovering on top of the trees that were there.  It just kept moving along that area.  Then what I believe why it left its that my cousin started flashing the cars light at it.  Then it started to move towards us then all of the sudden went higher and moved to another direction we followed it for a mile. It just flew over hwy 290 and we stopped.  It was already high and we could barely see it if it wasn’t for the green lights that keep turning on and of. And all of the sudden it moved in a circle and in a blink of an eye it just disappeared.  I have never seen anything move that fast.  I could see lights flashing on and off coming from inside the woods, but I thought it was the owner outside checking on some cows. I have not seen the saucer since then.  I have gone in the middle of the night just stay there to see if I see something.  Now there’s a company named LEWCO, were there we saw the saucer hovering.

Fighter jet and UFO over North Houston;2000-06-12 19:00:00;3 Minutes;Fighter jet and UFO over North Houston On June 12,2000, I was riding my bike down the street, facing the North side of Houston. I looked up and saw a US air force fighter jet flying west, just below the clouds. Since I normally like to see the contrails from the jet, I was watching closely.  I saw a object above the contrails.  At first I thought it was a helicopter because it setting very still. After staring at the object, I realized it was round and metallic, emitting no sound. It was tilted in about a twenty degree angle, with it's belly facing toward the south.  It had a grey-silver belly and the top half was a darky to black.  I kind of dark color I have never seen before that appeared to be vibrating.  The sun gleamed off the bottom since it was late in the afternoon. Two teenage boys, nearby playing basketball, were also looking up at the object as I was riding by them.  I said to them, Looks like a UFO doesn't it? and they responded, Yes, it sure does.  I look at the sidewalk for a second and when I looked at it again, it had disappeared. I stopped and looked around for awhile but it did not reappear.  The fighter jet left the area and did not return. Now I believe I have seen a UFO.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

My first of two UFO encounters was after I had moved into my new house.  We were still trying to unpack our room so I slept on floor and stared out my window for awhile.  After about 30 minutes a huge white orb came over the window.  The orb itself was incredibly bright but it cast no light around it.  It seamed very low because it so large, it filled my entire view coming over the house and flew past the window.  It gave off the sound of a very deep sounding yell.  The sound was pretty quite but still unmistakable that the orb was making it. It was way to large for a plane and it was almost like a perfect circle.  The bottom drooped down.  It flew very slowly over the house, stopping for only a second a little past the window.  It sped up almost suddenly, then slowed back to its original speed, like it  re-thought its movements. The object then flew perfectly strait and level in the direction of north.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

The backside of it was a bright white light and it flew off higher and higher away from earth.  There were planes in the sky at the time I saw this object so I had something to compare the object to and it was definatley not an airplane.

I was driving to work during the day and saw a shiny flying object, that camoflaged with the sky  and disappeared instantly.;2010-12-10 08:20:00;5 minutes;I was driving to work during the day and saw a shiny flying object, that camoflaged with the sky  and disappeared instantly. Well I’ve always maybe thought there could be something out there, but this experience has truly made me believe. On my way to work I was driving and noticing the particularly beautiful day and it was about 8:20 in the morning as  I crossed the bridge like I’ve done everyday for two years. Now in the area is what is called Ellington Field, which is a sort of airport for NASA and Military use.  I am used to seeing planes and hearing jets fly over. I tend to think of myself one who has my head in the clouds but as I was driving I noticed a particulary shiny flying object. I took a double look (thinking it was a cool looking plane) but it in fact was an all metal low and fast flying object. It was hard to see and I think the only reason I did was because the sun was to the right of me.The object was reflecting the sun light  but like a mirror as well camoflaging  itself with the sky at the same time.  It was flat but round like a disc but it had a small dome on! top and a slightly larger dome on the bottom. It was moving at a very fast speed, but not so fast that the speed Iwas going in my car could not keep up.  Now once I finally reached a red light on the busy morning road, wondering if anyone else was seeing what I was seeing, I fixed my eye on it. So after the light turned green, the speed of the object started to increase until instantly, as if it had known I had discovered it, it vanished like looking like a bright star in the day sky and then gone completely.  I didn’t suffer from any electric disturbances nor did really anyone else driving seem to notice, but I was for sure I had seen something out of the ordinary.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431

Looking straight up into even thought it hurt my eyes to do so I could see the heat it omitted from the bottom of it as if I was looking at the background of a hot paved road.  When it flew away the speed of it was incredible as it shot across the open skies westward towards the setting sun.  Later on I started experiencing a very uncomfortable shocking sensation behind my left ear which seem to exit on the top of my head.  I went and had a cat scan done to see why this was happening.

I continued walking and after a couple of minutes looking around the sky, I noticed that what I assumed the same disk on the left of me, but very far away and this time it was thinner and had a golden-orange color.   Another woman was passing us by and walking her dog and I asked her opinion on the disk, first she said that it is probably a plane, but after looking at it for a few seconds she agreed that it cannot be plane, because it was just sitting there.

I felt for my own protection I should rebuke it so I commanded it to go away in Jesus' name.   It continued to move slowly and silently west.  It was below the clouds and looked as it moved away like it might have a shiny top.  It disappeared behind a cloud further away and I went inside with the dogs because I was too concerned about having been seen to want to be outside.

On June 13, 2021, I took pictures of the sun’s rays coming through the clouds because the view looked very beautiful. I didn’t expect to capture anything other than the clouds and sun rays, but when I looked at the pictures again, a couple of days later, I saw what looked like a UFO after zooming in closer. The pictures we taken around 6:30 in the evening in a northwest direction. There was no sound, lights, nor anything that stood out in the sky as I was admiring the clouds or when I took the picture that day.;29.7819287281158;-95.4357030162431
