As flames shot up from my grill, me and my dog both saw and heard, a black Being (creature) in the corner of my yard. The creature made rustling noises. The creature was two to three-feet tall. It had legs, arms, a head, pointy things on its head, and gray glowing non matching eyes. It had a black aura. The entity made a rustling sound, like many leaves swooshing. My dog gave chase. The Entity bolted, casting rectangle lights on my fence as it ran faster than humanly possible. The Entity ran so fast that it caused a wind to blow throughout my yard. The creature cast a black trail behind it as it ran. There was no wind otherwise blowing anywhere. The Entity disappeared directly through my wood fence. My dog barked and growled, as the thing ran. I am a psychologist, and have never seen anything like this.I wanted immediately to report it.;30.6461945205481;-97.720096575343
