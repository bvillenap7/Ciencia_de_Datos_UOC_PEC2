Their shape was clearly visible, and there was a slight green hue to the light they emitted, which was very bright.  They were about 40 degrees above the horizon and moving apparently very fast.  One of them then suddenly reversed direction for about a second, very quickly moving back to approximately where I first saw it, then it suddenly reversed direction again and almost immediately caught up with the other object.  About a second later, both objects suddenly disappeared simultaneously.  There was no sound at all that I could hear from the objects.  I watched the sky for about 15 minutes longer, but did not see anything else unusual. I am a technical writer for a computer software company.
