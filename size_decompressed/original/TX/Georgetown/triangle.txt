Large, triangular shaped object with lights on bottom silently passes over my house, matches Austin couple's description;1985-07-15 23:00:00;45 seconds;Large, triangular shaped object with lights on bottom silently passes over my house, matches Austin couple's description I realize this is very old but my wife and I were shocked to see the description on your opening page by the Austin, Texas couple who saw (and drew) a triangular object with lights beneath it. My wife and I saw the exact, and I mean exact same object over 20 years ago in Georgetown, Texas, 25 miles north of Austin. We were freshmen in college and dating at the time - we were standing outside in my parents driveway at about 11pm when we saw what appeared to be a very large, delta-shaped object with lights below it and a bright light shining out in front (similar to a helicopter). This object was coming from the North and passed directly over our heads at an altitude of about 500 feet. We were sure at first it was a very quiet military plane until it passed over and it made absolutely no sound whatsoever. I joked as it came towards us that it was a UFO and my wife laughed until it passed quietly overhead - she then burst into tears. It passed over fairly slowly, the whole episode took about 45 seconds. We called the Sheriffs department who told us that they had been swamped with calls about the object. They also told us that they thought it was probably an experimental aircraft out of Fort Hood in Killeen, 30 miles north of Georgetown. After reporting it my wife and I pretty much kept it to ourselves unless people were telling UFO stories. It didn't seem extremely important to me until I saw that drawing and read of the close proximity to where we saw our object. Note: When I asked my wife is she remembered the event she said of course but neither of us can remember exactly what month or year it was, it was either 1985 or 86 and it was summer, probably July and it was definitely late, around 11 or 12. I know this isn't complete but I couldn't read that couple's experience and not comment for whatever it's worth.;30.6461945205481;-97.720096575343

Black triangles, rushing air sound and high rate of speed in area north of Austin on 06/27/04;2004-06-27 19:10:00;3 secs;Black triangles, rushing air sound and high rate of speed in area north of Austin on 06/27/04 At approximately 19:08, I had just walked onto the back patio and sat down. Then a few minutes later I hear what sounds to be like rushing air and the 5 to 10 seconds later I see around nine objects appear from above my patio cover heading south to southwest at a high rate of speed and low altitude. The objects were black in color, appeared to be triangular in shape and from the few seconds I was able to see them in the sky between the patio cover and the tree line, they appeared to fly almost in a formation with two offset from the formation on the right side.;30.6461945205481;-97.720096575343
