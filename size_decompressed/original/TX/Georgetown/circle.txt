Expanding/retracting spherical object sighted in southwestern sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a celestial body, possibly Venus.  PD));2005-12-21 21:00:00;2 hours;Expanding/retracting spherical object sighted in southwestern sky. Around 21:00 my family was returning home from shopping when my brother noticed what he thought was a shooting star coming down but it stopped midair.   When we got home we noticed a very bright spherical object in the southwestern sky.   At first we thought it might be a planet or bright star, but after a few minutes of observation we noticed it would change size and seemed to have lights that would come from and go back to it.   At first the lights looked like aircraft, but they moved in an erratic manner and continually appeared and dissapeared near the main object.   I got my video camera and zoomed in as far as I could and noticed the object was strangely textured and when I was zoomed all the way in it semed to retreat until I could no longer make out the texture.  We watched this go on for several hours and saw what appeared to be dozens of aircraft moving around in the sky at very low altitudes.  Some would appear to stop suddenly and change direction.  After going inside our house to change tape in the camera the object was gone entirely along with all of the various aircraft.

Saw bright, dark turquoise light in the air. it was there, and then not, all in an instant.;2013-08-11 01:00:00;2-3 seconds;Saw bright, dark turquoise light in the air.  It was there, and then not, all in an instant. I was at a party with a bunch of friends. I was about to leave.  I only had one beer that night and it was and hour and a half before the sighting.  I was sitting in a lawn chair staring up at a friend when i was the light out of the corner of my eye.   My first reaction was to look and see what it was. i stood up and freaked out. there were 3 or 4 people facing the same direction as i was, but only one of saw it, but he didnt bother to look. the U.F.O was heading towards Lake Georgetown. The house we were at was maybe a mile from the lake and it was heading in that general direction.;30.6461945205481;-97.720096575343
Silver, spherical obj. flying at a high rate of speed, no sound, over Georgetown, TX.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is ret. mil pilot.  PD));2017-04-08 16:30:00;10 seconds;Silver, spherical object flying at a high rate of speed with no sound over Georgetown, Texas. I was standing on my back porch about 4:30 pm, and spotted a UFO flying over my house, from South to North, at an extremely high rate of speed.  I estimate the altitude to be between 2000 and 3000 feet.  I saw what looked like a burst of smoke or a short contrail twice from the rear and once from the front, all of which quickly disappeared.   The object was spherical in shape, appeared to be silver in color and made no sound.  It never changed course and I lost sight of it over my roof after about 10 seconds.   I am a retired Army aviator, and the object did not look like a conventional aircraft of any kind.  I thought it might be a drone, but not like one that I have ever seen. ;30.6461945205481;-97.720096575343
