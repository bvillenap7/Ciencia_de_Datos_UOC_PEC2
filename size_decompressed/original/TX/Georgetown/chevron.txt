NE to SW, lasting approx. 30 to 45 seconds. On September 24, 2006, My wife and I were outside in our backyard taking advantage of a cool, clear night to look at the stars...as we gazed up we suddenly observed a V-shaped craft cross directly overhead...It appeared to be moving in excess of Mach 1 and was totally silent. I asked my wife if she could see what I was seeing and she confirmed and added that it apeared to have a vague, almost translucent disc shape around the craft itself. It moved in a straight line from approx. NE to SW. We estimate that it was anywhere from 1000 feet to 5000 feet, maybe lower and appeared to be the same size a DC-3 or Lear jet would be at the same altitude. Since we were directly under it, all we observed was the bottom of the craft which appeared milky, almost cloud-like in color. There were no lights on the craft at all, either running  lights or spotlights. It blocked out the stars as it passed overhead and there were no clouds to be observed...it was a severe clear night. The sighting lasted approx. 30 to 45 seconds until it disappeared into the light pollution to the south of us. Again, we observed no sound from the craft and we live in a very quiet part of town so there was nothing to interfere with our hearing anything unusual. There were no other witnesses.;30.6461945205481;-97.720096575343
