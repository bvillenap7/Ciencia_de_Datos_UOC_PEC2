ABDUCTED BY BRIGHT LIGHT;1976-08-01 00:00:00;6 hours;ABDUCTED BY BRIGHT LIGHT  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I WAS 18 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THIS EVENT. I WAS DRIVING HOME ABOUT MIDNIGHT. I WAS DRIVING A 1969 OLDSMOBILE 88. I WAS JUST ENTERING THE TOWN OF GEORGETOWN VIA THE OLD CITY PARK ROAD. THERE IS A STOP SIGN RIGHT BEFORE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A LEFT TO ENTER THE PARK. I PULLED UP TO THE STOP SIGN AND STOPPED. I WAS DRIVING BY MYSELF, AND THERE WERE NO CARS BEHIND ME OR IN FRONT OF ME. I WAS STOPPED AT THE STOP SIGN AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A BRIGHT, BLINDING LIGHT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME. THE WIDTH OF THE LIGHT WAS ABOUT 30 FEET WIDE. THE NEXT THING I REMEMBER, I AM SITTING IN MY CAR AND IT IS 6:00 AM IN THE MORNING. MY CAR IS RUNNING AND IT IS STOPPED RIGHT WERE IT WAS WHEN I SAW THE LIGHT. THE CAR IS NOW IN PARK INSTEAD OF THE DRIVE POSITION. THIS WAS THE ONLY THING THAT I NOTICED. I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE AND TURNED THEN I NOTICED THE TIME. I HAVE NO MEMORY OF WHAT HAPPENED DURING THOSE 6 HOURS. SHORTLY AFTER THIS EVENT, I NOTICED TWO SMALL BUMPS ON THE BACK OF M! Y HEAD AT THE BASE OF THE SKULL. THERE WERE NO MARKS JUST THE TWO SMALL BUMPS. THEY ARE STILL THERE TO THIS DAY. THE BUMPS NEVER HURT , OR CAUSED ME ANY PAIN. AFTER THAT EVENT I DID NOTICE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I HAD NEVER NOTICED BEFORE. FIRST, EVERY WATCH I EVER WORE ON MY WRIST AFTER THAT WOULD RUN A FOR A WHILE AND THEN JUST STOP. I COULD SET THE WATCH DOWN AND IT WOULD ALWAYS RUN FINE. IF I PUT IT BACK ON IT WOULD STOP. THIS WAS THE SAME WITH EVERY WATCH I PUT ON MY WRIST. I BOUGHT A POCKET WATCH AND WOULD CARRY IT IN MY POCKET AND IT WOULD WORK FINE. IT IS STILL THAT WAY TO THIS DAY. SECONDLY, I NOTICED EVERY TIME I PUT A PHONE UP TO MY RIGHT EAR IT WOULD MAKE A LOUD HIGH PITCHED BACK FEEDING SOUND. THAT IS THE SAME SIDE THAT THE TWO SMALL BUMPS ARE AT THE BASE OF MY SKULL. TODAY SOME PHONES I USE MAKE THE BACK FEEDING NOISE AND SOME DO NOT. I CAN HOLD ANY PHONE TO MY LEFT EAR AND I NEVER DID GET THE BACK FEEDING NOISE. I NEVER TOLD THIS TO ANYONE FOR MANY YEARS. I ! TOLD MY WIFE AND KIDS MANY YEARS LATER, AND NO ONE ELSE UNTIL ! I TOLD A FEW OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS TWO MONTHS AGO. I GUESS ITS TIME TO MAKE THE REPORT NOW, SO I AM.;30.6461945205481;-97.720096575343
2 ufo no picture Georgetown tx;2011-02-25 04:00:00;5 min;2 ufo no picture Georgetown tx Unknow objects observed.... Location: Georgetown,Texas Date: 02-25-11 Time: approximate 4:00 am  Description of event: The cat rattles the door to get in. This woke me at 3:47am. I did not let the cat in. The cat rattled the door till almost 4:00am. I went to the sliding glass door and made the following observation. Two object seen in the Eastern sky. At first they were the same intensity as surronding  stars. They increased in brightness and and went directly up. This was not a matter of the object going off towards the horizon. One object was smaller and displayed a red tint with flashes of white.  The other was larger and solid white. No sound was noted. The lights had grown so small they were getting hard to see.... One object then made a change in direction and headed South. The other remained in position for a minute or two then also headd south.;30.6461945205481;-97.720096575343
It was a big huge glowing green light in the sky that was there moved then vanished.;2012-04-10 01:00:00;A split second;It was a big huge glowing green light in the sky that was there moved then vanished. I was standing there talking and all of a sudden I looked up and there was a glowing green circle in the sky.  It was big and it was there for a second and moved fast in the sky then disappeared.  There was no way it was a plane, too big.  No way it was a shooting star, too big and it was a green glowing light that was there then moved then disappeared!;30.6461945205481;-97.720096575343
My wife and I were in the middle of an early morning walk on June 15, 2018 in Georgetown, Texas (Old Historic District, near Annie Purl;2018-06-15 05:05:00;25 minutes+;My wife and I were in the middle of an early morning walk on June 15, 2018, in Georgetown, Texas (Old Historic District, near Annie Purl Elementary).  As a former USAF T-38 instructor pilot, I'm sensitive to aircraft overhead.   At 5:05 a.m., I noticed a solid light heading from the north-northeast to the south-southwest (roughly a heading from 020 to 200 degrees, based on compass reading).  The light was about the intensity of a satellite, but not following the normal north-south path of previously observed satellites.  We heard jet engines at altitude (higher than airliners approaching Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.  Upon more careful observation, we saw several lights in formation, then determined four in the formation.  They were not in “fingertip” formation, rather in a triangle, with a trailing aircraft.  The lights were steady white (like formation lights), not blinking “position” lights.  We thought,” cool.”  Then another formation appeared, then another.  After more than four formations, we were even more interested.  Occasionally, there would be a brighter light, without other lights near.  Also, occasionally, there would be a different formation pattern, with three leading in a line-abreast pattern, with one trailer, centered.   We continued to watch, with formations of four passing continuously for a total of 25 to 30 minutes.  There had to be at least 50 aircraft, and perhaps 100 +, so we wondered where that many military planes could come from and be heading to.  Was it an exercise.  A source said that the NORTHCOM exercises were delayed this year. ???   We contacted the local FAA airport tower, then Austin TRACON, then Houston ARTCC.  None said they had radar or other records of what we saw.  So we're curious.  What were they?  Houston ARTCC suggested we contact UFOCenter.com.  So we did.   Thanks.  We look forward to an explanation.  We were not illuminated by bright searchlights, so we do not suspect aliens.;30.6461945205481;-97.720096575343
