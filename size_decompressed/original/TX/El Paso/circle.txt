Saucer 50 ft. above hovering over us.;1972-07-16 17:30:00;2 minutes;Saucer 50 ft. above hovering over us. It was a summer night in Texas in 1972, I was 11 years old at the time.  I remember very  vividly the local news channel my parents were watching saying there were strange sightings of flashing lights in the sky around town that were unexplained.  It didn’t seem very alarming to my parents at the time so being kids, we were not very concerned, just kind of excited to see them. 	My sister and I went outside to see if we could get a glimpse of any of these so called lights in the sky.  She was 6 at the time so of course she followed me.  We went out to the back yard to see if we could spot any, it was around 5:00 PM, so the sun was still out.  It was about 15 minutes and we didn’t see anything so we decided to sit on the brick fence and watch for a few more minutes, nothing. 	We were just about ready to jump off the fence when we spotted 3 flashing lights in the distance, probably no more than a few miles away.  They were still and were like flashing orbs.  We got excited and jumped off the fence (it was a small brick fence) and were going to go inside to tell my parents when all of a sudden we heard a humming from right above us.  At that point we were in the middle of the back yard.  I looked up and to my amazement, saw a ribbon of round flashing lights not 50 feet above us. It was a disk, sort of like the flying saucer you see in comic strips.  The lights were different colors and they were flashing around in circles.  It must have been no more than a few seconds when I looked at my sister to see if she was seeing the same thing.  She had fallen to the ground, passed out. I was scared and shook her to see if she was OK.  She opened her eyes and I heard a whoosh. I looked up and the saucer and gone.  Both of us were shocked and couldn’t talk. She got u! p to run in the house to tell Mom and Dad.  I stopped  her and said, “Don’t tell Mom and Dad, they won’t believe us.  This is just our secret”.  Surprisingly she did not say anything that night, or even the next few days.  I had dreams about that evening for days, not bad dreams at all, just like it was watching over us. 	Years went past and we didn’t tell a soul about that night.  We have two sisters and a brother and kept this all to ourselves.  She was very young so I thought she just forgot.  I had so many dreams about that night and after all the years went by, I convinced myself it was just a dream. 	Thirty five years passed, it was Thanksgiving and we were talking about when we were kids.  I mentioned a dream I had about seeing a flying saucer when we lived in Texas.  My sister flushed, turned as white as a ghost and said she had the same dream.  She explained her and I were sitting on the back yard fence looking at the skies when she saw flashing lights in the distance.  She remembers running and looking up seeing some kind of saucer with different colored lights at the bottm and passing out after seeing it.  She remembers me waking her up saying, “Don’t tell Mom and Dad, they won’t believe us.” 	Did we both have the same dream?  I don’t think so.  I believe what we saw was real and deep in my heart, I know there are peaceful beings out there watching us.  Maybe knowing our hearts and letting us know we are not alone.

about 9:50 pm while seating on steeps of front porche facing south I observe a light above Juarez mx just like a plane landing and as w;2002-08-25 21:30:00;3 minutes to 5 min;about 9:50 pm while seating on steeps of front porche facing south I observe a light above Juarez mx just like a plane landing and as what I tought it was because the of location of Juarez airport its directly under the light on question,the light kept on geting closer than after it reach over the line of texas veered to the right as a 90 degree angle as when I noticed the color was more yelloish an there where no navegation lights .it gave me the impresion it was the size of a jet linner lights. after the close to nigthy degree turn  the light glare was the same. I  got my girlfriend to get me fieldglasses and i had to adjust the focus quite a bit by then the object was far east an then the light speeded up considerable and vanished. I went back on to what i was doing (sorting out dirt and sand on a plastic container) and I dont know weather ten minutes or half an hour past i raised my head after hearing some people two adults and a few kids walking on the sidewalk in front of me saying look at those lights and I got up and there where 4 lights similar in size as the one I saw early, but this time they where comming from the west south of the texas line from the direction of the mountain towards and on top of juarez(not to high up but close tothe grownd maybee 100 to 200 feet up?) down town one after the other one maybe half a mile a apart from eachether and while they reach more or less the same point where the previous one passed by . they formed a square and then the one from the far and upper left and the one on the bottom right I think started distanciating from the other two creating a rombo (in spanish terms )or an square buth of irregular sides. while this was going of I focuss one of the lightswith the fieldglasses and after focussing the shape is like an yelloing orange shape bowl almost like dark burning object a total circle but at the shape of almost a half moon patern seems to apear like more solid shape. I did not have time to explored the other three because the kids close tome wanted to look at them too but they appear to be of the same size after geeting my glasses back I think regaing lookin at the same one and lost the other three the one in question kept goin east but now under american soil and straight east just south of freeway ten and norht of the rio grande. The moon was close to full and this thing was at the same height and very small compare tom the moon size but i can compare the size to alinner plane lights. after I no longer colud see the light at plain sight I steel was able to find it with my fieldglasses and it seems to be maintaining the same speed. The three minures frame time goes in referance of the first sighting the second one dont have any idea on how  long it took may be ten to twenty minutes;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
A large white round object moving slowly across the sky and helicopters flying near the vicinity.;2003-08-31 13:15:00;10 minutes;A large white round object moving slowly across the sky and helicopters flying near the vicinity. My 8 yr. old son and I were working on my car at about 1:15 p.m. in the afternoon, when I heard two military helicopters flying overhead and they were making so much noise I kept looking at them. When they soon left I saw a round light moving slowly but not following the copters. It look like the sun but smaller, maybe the size of an airplane and I couldn't tell the distance it was.  It was a hazy color so anyone could look directly at it. I couldn't make out what it was. It wasn't a plane or not even a weather balloon. But I have a feeling the military was there keeping an eye on it. I didn't hear anything on the news or paper about it.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463

The objec t that my roommate and I viewed was not at all like anything I have ever seen in my life...please help me;2005-05-19 06:00:00;45min-1hr;The object that my roommate and I viewed was not at all like anything I have ever seen in my life...please help me Just one object was seen.  It at first appeared to be a helicopter because it hovered and moved very slowy in a south western direction.  When I looked at it with my eyes alone, I could not decipher exactly what the image was. I thought it was a plane but the lights seemed too bright.  I also thought that it might be a star or the moon as you might view them as the sun is rising in the morning, however, the object appeared to be moving.   I returned to my home from my morning walk,.  I retrieved my binoculars from my car and then viewed the object.  I thought I would see something normal that would explain what seemed abnormal.  What I saw was a somewhat round object silver in color outlined with what looked like a flourescent light tube that rapped arround the entire object.  At the base of the object there were three beams of the same flourescent light that encircled the object.  The shape of the beams were similar to the fire seen when a rocket is taking off or boosting power.  They were located at the base of the object.  One on both ends and one in the middle that appeared to be shorter that the other two.   I did awaken my roommate and asked him to come outside and view what I had seen.  He asked me what he was suppose to see.  I told him to just look and tell me what he thought it was.  He said that it must be a UFO and just went back to bed.  He did see the same image that I viewed.   I checked the morning paper to see if I could find an explanation for what I saw.  This evening I telephoned three local TV news stations and asked if anyone had reported seeing any strange obects that morning on the the west side of El Paso.  They all answered no.  The object that I saw was not a balloon, a plane, a helicopter nor was it like anything I have ever seen in my lifetime.   I am not one to make up stories.  I saw what I saw and so did my roommate.  I am sure there is a logical explanation for what I saw and that is why I must know what it was that I did see.  Any help that you can offer would be greatly appreciated.  I just need to know what it was?  Thanks.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
50 UFO spotted at the same time performing geometric movements;2006-01-29 17:00:00;15 minutes;50 UFO spotted at the same time performing geometric movements As washing my car, I turned to the sky and saw a white dot in the sky.  I thought it to be an airplane since it was in the direction of the airport, but then I saw another, and another, and another.  I ran inside to get my glasses and when I came outside I saw what was about 50 of these white figures in the sky.  It was a cloudy day so at times the clouds would come in and hide the figures from view but would appear again.  Gradually the figures started fading away until only 3 of these figures remained. They appeared to make a triangle in the sky (two of them linear and the other in front of them).  Then one of them proceeded to make movement towards the other ones, until they were all perfectly lined up.  Then it went back to its original point and again came back to make a straight line and then finally to its original point. Dark clouds once again came in hiding them from view and when the cloud gave an opening to the sky the objects were not visible anymore.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
Circular light above clouds in circular pattern over El Paso, Texas;2011-08-17 02:30:00;20 minutes;Circular light above clouds in circular pattern over El Paso, Texas We witnessed a white, circular shaped light rapidly running in a circular patterned.  The source of the light appeared to be above the clouds and showing through the clouds similar to the moon showing through the clouds.   The moon was nearby this light pattern.   The circular shape continued round and round for approximately 15 to 20 twenty minutes before it stopped at the 6 o'clock point on the circle and then vanished.  We did not hear any sounds from the area of the circuling light.   We did see a helicopter quite a distance away at a much lower altitude.   We also heard the sound of a jet aircraft on the opposite side of the night sky from the location of the light in question.  Our first instinct was the jet came from Biggs Field, which is part of Ft. Bliss.  We did not see any news reports regarding this sighting.  Surely someone other than us saw this light as well.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
Silver orb floating over far westside of El Paso for over an hour;2011-10-14 18:00:00;1 1/2 hrs;Silver orb floating over far westside of El Paso for over an hour We were on the far Westside of El Paso at my son’s baseball practice. The location of the ballpark allows for a panoramic view of the entire Westside.  At approximately 6pm I noticed a perfectly circular orb floating in the sky. It was reflecting the sunlight and was shining silver.  At first glance I thought it was a mylar balloon floating up into the sky but I kept watching and this orb was not moving. It was just sitting there in the sky perfectly still.  It did not deviate at all from its position or shape. The wind was blowing and this orb never moved, which led me to think this was something else entirely.  It was silent.  One of the other parents who were sitting alongside me noticed me staring up and asked what I was looking at.  I pointed the orb out to her and she commented on how it wasn’t moving as well. Before long all of the parents were looking at this thing.  As the sun began to set we noticed the orb getting darker and by 7:00 it appeared to be dark gray in color.   For about 1 ½ hours it sat perfectly still in the same exact spot, then it just disappeared.  We did not see it fly away or shoot off. It just disappeared. All of us were left scratching our heads. Very strange.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
Strange circular aircraft in the sky;2012-02-01 15:00:00;2 hours;Strange circular aircraft in the sky My Husband and I were watching the air traffic from our courtyard at our home here in el paso.....we see all sorts of aircraft from airliners, jets, drones, by planes and helicopters.  But then we saw what looked like a white ball gradually cruising along at the same altitude west towards new mexico.  My husband ran and got our camera and managed to zoom in on this object… This first object was pretty low and upon zooming in on it we realized it was a ball of light with what looked two matalic objects on it.. one on top and bottom almost apearing disk shaped.... Then after a while it seemed to disappear and re-appear in the sky as it got further away.....shortly after that we came back outside and noticed four more of the very same objects flying around each other in zig zag patterns....it was very unatural to me and Ive never seen anything like these things...  These four seemed to be much higher and father away. we capture and focused on as many as we could w! ith our camera at that moment but they were very hard to focus on.....when those seemed to disappear in the sky a few friends stopped by and as we were showing them what we caught on camera....another apppeared in the sky going the same direction as the first.....we caught video of that one too.... The air traffic was very busy that day but this was nothing I have ever seen before.... There were no clouds in the sky except the cem trails from the passing just we get from fort bliss. These odd objects in the sky did not make any sound and seem to fly in a most unual pattern...my close ups reveal that this is not a plane of any sorts.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463

Single round, reddish yellowish, greenish light in the sky which moved very rapidly and stood still, then moved again then stood still;2014-01-10 06:15:00;~2 minutes;I will be brief.  This is the third UFO I have seen so far, and all three in the last four months (speaking in terms of linear time).  I walked out of my house in the morning to get my cannabis which I had left in my car.  (I had not consumed any yet)  Being a winter morning, the sun had not come out yet.   I love to gaze at the stars and have been doing so since I was a child almost daily,  Sometimes for hours.  (Present age 28) I know the constellations and have and can distinguish stars from planets, plus I have taken some astronomy courses in college and stargazing has been a lifelong hobby.   I noticed a single round, reddish yellowish, greenish light in the sky which moved very rapidly and stood still, then moved again then stood still.  Then moved at a constant speed, then came to a complete stop and vanished slowly into the heavens, out of my sight.  It did not share any qualities that an airplane exhibits.   An airplane’s light flickers at a constant tempo and the movement is constant and CAN NOT come to a complete stop in the middle of the sky.   If I had a compass I would say the UFO came to halt at a perfect North.  I did not have a compass so I am basing my observations on the stars’ and the sun’s movements.  Make of this experience whatever resonates with your vibrations.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
Bright Spheres Of Light Observed Flying Formation in Access of 2,500 mph;2015-04-06 20:15:00;2 seconds;Bright Spheres Of Light Observed Flying Formation in Access of 2,500 mph 5 May, 2015. On 6 April, 2015, (Monday) at approximately 20:15 hrs, in El Paso, Texas, while sitting on my porch, I observed approximately 5 bright yellow/orange bright spheres of light (orbs) moving in access of 2,500 mph across the sky.  The brightly colored orbs did not glow and were approximately the four miles to the southwest of my location, over a suburban neighborhood, and four to five miles south of the El Paso International Airport at approximately 2,000 feet above the ground.   The orbs were about the size of a Volkswagen beetle and were flying horizontal to the horizon in formation.  As I was sitting down at the time of the observation looking towards the SW the orbs appeared from behind a tree on my left and in approximately 2 seconds disappeared behind a tree on right and were moving from the SE to the NW.   I did not see or hear any aircraft flying in the vicinity of the orb sighting for at least another 15 minutes. I have been in the aviation arena for over 46 years, I was an Army helicopter pilot for 29 years and have over 6,300 hour of flight time of which over 2,000 hours were during night time.  I am an Instructor Pilot, Maintenance Test Pilot, Safety Officer/Accident Investigator, and currently a Military Airfield Manager.  In all my years of flying I have never experienced an orb sighting or head of any other aviation personnel discuss orbs. I remember viably the orbs of light that I saw on 6 April.  The five bright lights were flying in a straight line formation.  The four lights that were following the lead light were slightly accelerating and decelerating to maintain their relative position in the formation of lights.
