A noiseless, round object with colorful bright lights, hovering in the desert of northeast El Paso Tx. by McGregor Range.;1987-11-27 17:30:00;30 seconds;A noiseless, round object with colorful bright lights, hovering in the desert of northeast El Paso Tx. by McGregor Range. On November 27th 1987 I was out in the desert, northeast of El Paso Tx. close to McGregor Range.  I saw an object hovering to the south of my location.  The object did not make any noise and it had different colored lights on it.  The lights were going in circles around the object.  The object appeared to be round and appeared to be large.  As I watched the object hover it proceeded further east slowly and then moved west slowly, and in a split second it headed into the sky at a very high rate of speed.  I could no longer see it, and it left no trail, nor noise.   I have never reported this to anyone, because I was always afraid of ridicule.  Only people who have seen something like it will believe me.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
Group of 19 small, white bright objects traveling around larger white object seen in El Paso Texas skies.;2007-03-16 11:45:00;8 min;Group of 19 small, white bright objects traveling around larger white object seen in El Paso Texas skies. The location and weather:  Above BIGGS Airfield, El Paso, TX. It was a beautiful clear day, no clouds and around 78 Fahrenheit. Description: One large white object, oval and moving very slowly towards the mountains.  Around the large oval object were about 19 smaller, objects looming around the larger object.  There was a very big difference in size between the larger object and the other smaller ones. The large one was very easy to see.  The smaller ones were very small and spread out.  With much difficulty we were able to count 19 of the smaller ones. Their shape:  The large one had the shape of a jellyfish oval on top and flatter on the bottom with shaded area on bottom.  The small objects were bright white specks such as a star might look in the daytime.  However, these were not stars.  They were spread out around the white object and stayed around it for 5-10 minutes.  After that, we were only able to see the bigger object and no longer saw the bright specks anywhere. There was air traffic in the area, bith civil and air force. Our background:  First observer = wife educator in school district.  Second observer=husband real estate.  Third observer = 7 year old son 2nd grade student;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
At approximately 17:45 Hrs while swimming in an outdoor pool in El Paso,Texas.,I saw a white dot that appeared to be frozen in the sky;2007-09-07 17:45:00;20 MIN.;At approximately 17:45 Hrs while swimming in an outdoor pool in El Paso,Texas.,I saw a white dot that appeared to be frozen in the sky just like a star. I went inside the house and retrieved my 8 x 30mm binoculars. I focused the lenses, and I cold barely see the object: However, it appears that it had a round center with bicycle spokes, and the object did not move. Since the object was so far I kept losing it since my binoculars were hand supported. i found the object several times, and it appears to have move just a bit or perhaps it was the earth's rotation. I found the object at approximately 18:05 and this time I was looking at TWO objects instead of one.my wife witnessed the first object, and I went inside the house to tell her that a second object had appeared. My wife did not get to witness the second object because both disappeared. I am 65 years old,and my last sighting was in the late 1940's in the El Paso area.At that particular time the newspapers reported that they were Helium balloons., in the both sightings I had to really focus my eyes in order to identify the objects. The objects did nothing. I hope that you can notify someone in the El Paso,TX area who has the right knowledge and equipment since this incident happened in a clear and sunny day.

Strange Orb above El Paso.;2011-05-29 00:00:00;Less than 5 min;Strange Orb above El Paso We were both standing in front of our house staring up at the sky looking for stars that donâ€™t blink thinking that those are planets.   I went inside to get my telescope to check some of them out.  We first saw what most people describe as a satellite floating way up in the sky.   Then I caught a flash in the corner of my eye and I looked up at the constellation of the little dipper.  To the right of it we noticed what looked like a motorcycle headlight coming straight down at us at about the level that most airplanes travel only this object had no red or blue blinking lights like a plane usually does.  The object had a bright almost halogen look to it then turned around within two seconds and it had a red glow at the end of it.   Within two seconds it began to speed away straight up into space and became smaller and smaller.  Most aircraft travel from left to right or vice versa.   This object turned around and went straight up and in seconds was gone.  There were no c! louds in the sky.   We heard not one sound coming from it.   A few minutes later a plane passed in the same area and we could hear the engines.  To me I have only seen what they show us on television.  This looked like one of those Orbs that people talk about.   It raced away into space after I pointed at it.  It was so fast that I cant describe anything on this earth that moves the way it did.   This is not a hoax.  We know what we saw.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
