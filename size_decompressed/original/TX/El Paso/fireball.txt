No sound  at all.  It was not a plane or helicopter.  All this happened on El Paso writh on front of Ft. Dix.  About two miles away from my home.  I dont know What I saw.  It was a yellow bright light and then turn to light blue and solid rectangular form and dissapear.   It took about o1:00 hours to be seen this in time.   Again I repeat I dont know what I saw?  But I know it was not from here.  To many things like no sound and the directions it took wich it is impossible for a plane to perform.  A helicopter with no sound it is also imposible.  From right to left no sound â€¦ Hope to hear from you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
There was a flash and it vanished...;2008-02-23 13:00:00;about 3 seconds;There was a flash and it vanished... I was with my high school baseball team in El Paso Texas. We were in the middle of a game and I happened to look up into the sky. I noticed a bright green light, it resembled a falling star. It was traveling very fast in towards the ground. It only lasted about 3 seconds then it turned to flames and immediately dissapeared. Less than a minute later, three jets which looked to me like military fighter jets, came up from about where the light had been and branched in three directions. One went straight, one went to the right and the other to left. I never saw the planes again. 4 other players along with myself witnessed all of the above. I'm not sure if any spectators noticed what was going on. I'm not sure if it was a UFO or just an honest trick of the eye. None the less, it was strange.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
When I lived in El Paso TX, my roomates told me about this light that they see repeatedly out the window.;2009-06-30 21:00:00;45 seconds repeatedly;When I lived in El Paso TX, my roomates told me about this light that they see repeatedly out the window. They showed me one night, and after that, I would see it as often as they would, my roomates told me that there is no air ports or anything like that that far away. We where on the east side of El Paso looking straight south into Mexico, the object was always a super bright shining light and looked to be 150-300 miles away, and always slowly came to the surface of the earth, it took about one minute for it to do this.   Some nights I would also see it multiple times. and one night I saw the object fly up really fast in to the air then disappear. sometimes the light would have a red tint to it. ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot identify the object, of course, but we have no reason to believe that it was a genuine UFO.  Date in 2009 is approximate.  PD));31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463

It was yellowish with a little orange. It was moving backward and foward. It didn't make a noise nor the light was blinking. After about 5 or 8 seconds it disapeared.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
Fiery balls falling from the sky over El Paso.;2012-10-20 19:20:00;2 minutes;Fiery balls falling from the sky over El Paso. My husband and I were driving west on 375. He pointed at something in the sky. It was a fiery ball falling from the sky. We discussed how shooting stars aren't that slow and we watched it fall. Once it fell close to the surface it stopped moving and turned into a white light instead of flaming. It stayed in that position for about 30 seconds and then disappeared. As we started to exit 375 to get onto 601 we noticed 3-4 cars parked along the side of the road. People were outside of their cars pointing toward the mountain.  As my husband and I looked over we same the same fiery ball falling toward the mountain.  This time it split into 5 separate balls, each did the same thing as the first.  They fell until they were closer to the ground then hovered once they turned into a white light.  Stayed light that for a few seconds and then disappeared.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
A fireball was traveling horizontally to the left but before extinguishing a second fireball did the same and flew up into the sky;2016-04-30 22:30:00;>4 minutes;A fireball was traveling horizontally to the left, but before extinguishing a second fireball did the same and flew up into the sky I was going back inside when I noticed a bright object floating slowly across the sky, my first thought was that its a nice big bright falling asteroid but when I completely focused on it I saw that it continued to glide slowly across the sky moving like a feather horizontal to the left I called my 2 friends from inside to come out and look for themselves I then moved closer to my front yard to follow the object with my eyes my 2 friends and my self witnessed the object.  I have 20/20 vision so to me this object looked perfectly round and I saw bright orange and red flames surrounding this perfect circle I kept talking out loud narrating to my friends how this was definitely no ordinary ufo sighting so this is why I say it took at least 4 min.  Unfortunately I didn't want to go inside and get my camera I was enjoying the ufo hands on very selfish like.  So now that time had past the object began to dim out and started to come down it reminded me of a hot air balloon the flames we're extinguishing and the perfect circle kept coming down vertically now at a slow pace after it was almost invisible and still falling down a second fireball appeared in the sky from where the same direction in the sky as when I saw the first one, this second object also reminded me of a hot air ballon motion only this one floated across the sky horizontally to the left but with great speed very quickly it flew to the same location the stopped above when it reached the same location as the fist object as if it was trying to catch up to it but instead of extinguishing it flew itself straight up into the sky perfectly straight up and up and up until puff just like that we couldn't see it or anything else after that.  So what happened to the first one?  Did it land??;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
