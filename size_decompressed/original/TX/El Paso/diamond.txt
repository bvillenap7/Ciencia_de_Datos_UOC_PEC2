Color at this time was like white or silver As it transformed it began to climb altitude... Slow not in a rush as it claimed it just disappeared  The day was clear no wind no clouds in sky  Was not a hot air ballon or Mylar ballon due to hovering properties  The sun was still out.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
