Saw a UFO before my daily run.;1987-05-06 18:15:00;15 to 20  seconds;Saw a UFO before my daily run. I was in a park close to my home in a clear afternoon when I was excercising before my daily run.  In one of my stretches, I bent over and went back up and something had caught my attention. I saw in the sky above me a saucer still in one spot.  I took a good look at it (15 to 20 seconds), it had a white, metallic color on the outside with a shape of a disk with a dome on the top.  I looked around if someone else was also watching what I was looking at.  Nobody was, only me.  I looked back up and the saucer was gone.  I tried to see it in another spot in the sky, but didn't find it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
Light's in Triangle Fromation;1996-06-01 20:00:00;1 hour;Light's in Triangle Fromation I was working the second shift at Levis Strauss and was lunch time 8:00 pm MST. I noticed a group of people in the front side of the building looking towards the Western part of the sky over the Franklin Mountains and noticed 3 blinking lights in a triangle formation. I witneesed 1 of the lights move up and then go back down into the formation. Then they all moved in unison. The lights were there for roughly 20 min when fighter jets came from the southwest and the lights moved away in remarkable speed. As the jets passed by and left the lights came back in the same triangle formation. My wife stated the local news caught footage of this, and did identify them as UFO's. A day later they came back with the same story and apologized to the people for the misunderstanding of the report, and stated the military was conducting weather experiments. I would like to know if anyone else witnessed this. Thank you.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
An unknown object was seen floating in a deserted place not far from homes.;2003-10-24 20:00:00;not known;An unknown object was seen floating in a deserted place not far from homes. The unknown object was seen on the sky, not so high and not so low.  Above a deserted area but not far from homes.  I was driving along with five other people when, I being the driver was checking what was ahead of me and that's when I saw a strange object in the sky with a bright orange/yellow light blinking on/off.  That's when I told the other passangers to check that out and everyone agreed that it wasn't an airplane or a helicopter.  All the passangers and I have lived in this town for quite some time and we know the difference between most of the airplanes and helicopters because El Paso has an airport, army base, and it's a border town.  We always have commercial airplanes,army jets, and helicopters in the sky so we already know how they look and sound. But this object was just floating in the sky for about 4-6 minutes in the same place.  The object didn't move from that exact place in those 4-6 minutes it was just flashing a orange/yellow light on and off.  Then suddenly the object will move forward and backward in a very rapid speed.  We could se it really close because it wasn't that high in the sky, and we could see the fast speed it moved forward and backward and then staying in the same place again were it was floating the first time.  No commercial airplane, helicopter, or army jet I have seen in this town has moved so fast and be so low.  And I've seen all kinds of army jets, some I saw about a month ago because we had a Air Show and was able to see all kinds of jets.  Then after 4-6 minutes this object suddenly moved from the deserted place to a place were there's more lights were you could find stores,malls, and fast food places.  For what I saw, he was close to a WalMart in east El Paso, just floating in top and flashing the same light again but this time he was floating higher in the sky then the object continued to move further away and I couldn't see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the sighting is unknown to us, but we assume it is not in the year 1904, as the witness/student indicates.  We have requested clarification.

My daughter and I were playing basketball with her two children in the driveway.  El Paso is in the flight path of many airline routes.

Military jet takes off and tries to intercept a disc-shaped UAP.  As jet gets close, both UAP and jet suddenly disappear.;2019-05-06 15:03:00;1 minute;Military jet takes off and tries to intercept a disc-shaped UAP. As jet gets close, both UAP and jet suddenly disappear. My friends and I were returning home, traveling north on Rte 54 (Patriot Freeway).  At about 3:01 pm I noticed a fighter jet taking off from Biggs Airfield at Fort Bliss, El Paso, TX.  As I watched it ascend, it began to turn East away from me as it climbed rapidly.  I thought its flight path unusual, and continued to watch it ascend towards a bank of clouds above it.  The jet turned so sharply that its wings were vertical to the ground as it made a U-turn back towards the South.  Then I noticed an object hovering just below the clouds over Biggs Army Airfield.  I recognized it as a UAP or UFO, and grabbed my cell phone camera.  It took me a few seconds to get the camera operating.  By that time the jet was rapidly closing the gap with the UAP.  In response, the UAP began to back up and move away from the approaching jet.  I was stunned!  I aimed my camera and pushed the shutter button, but my cell phone camera did not respond fast enough.  Suddenly both the UAP and jet both disappeared.  The photograph time is 3:03 pm, taken just after the jet and UAP disappeared.  I asked my friend, who was driving, and he said he didn't see it.  He is an audio witness to my sighting.  I have no idea what happened to that jet. The picture shows the scene with the distant Hueco Tanks Mountains and sacred Cero Alto Mountain (tallest) in the background to the East.  The picture recorded the date and time of the photograph, and even GPS location of our car at 3,000 Gateway North Boulevard (access road to the Patriot Freeway).  Visibility was excellent at 10 miles.  I overlaid the photo with an image of what type of UAP/UFO I saw and the type of jet, as best as I could make out from four miles away (map distance).  I added dots to mark the path of the jet as it made a high-angle U-turn towards the UAP/UFO. I posted this picture and account on my Facebook profile, and had a number of responses.  Ted Roe of NARCAP made an interesting comment:  T. R. (NARCAP)  My guess.... plane was too close when the ufo bolted, inside the envelope when it jumped.  Probably carried the plane with it to where ever it was when it stopped... F18.... I watched one pursuing an object that appeared to be 2 silver spheres connected with a thin bar.... it left instantaneously but the plane wasn't that close.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
