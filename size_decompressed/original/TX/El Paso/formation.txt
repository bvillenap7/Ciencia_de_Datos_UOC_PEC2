The;2020-11-25 04:45:00;Approx 1min 30 sec;I was traveling on the 375 freeway in El Paso, south bound when I saw the formation appearing to hover in the south east direction. The formation appeared distant in the night sky. At arms length I believe I would be able to cover the formation with my pinky. Which brings me to the formations shape. At first glance it appeared a line formation, as I stared closely and tried to focus, the formation had a slight bend at end. Which brings me to its angle . The approx 15 separate lights in the formation had a light amber glow to them. The formation itself appeared in a diagonal direction and they seemed to be moving away from my line of sight and the lights slowly faded into the darkness of the sky;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
