Large Mothership type craft drops smaller craft out of bottom then disappears;1972-07-15 22:00:00;12 min.;Large Mothership type craft drops smaller craft out of bottom then disappears It was summertime 1972 in a suburb of El Paso, TX. My 2 friends, my brother and I were out late that night (after 10:00 pm). I was 11 yrs, my brother 9, the others about the same age. We were playing some game on the sidewalk, and we noticed a huge yellow light in the sky, approx. 1/16 diameter of a full moon. It seemed to be very high in the sky or in space. The small airport called Sunland Park was visible in the west accross IH 10, and the lights from some small planes could be seen in the vicinity of the airport. The light was very high above the airport, and slowly moving to the north. We were excited, and I said to my friend that we should run up the block to his house to get his new telescope. At first he didn't want to, being afraid we would miss something while we were running up. But it kept moving so slowly that he agreed, and we sprinted up the street to get the scope. When we got to his house his Dad was out getting ready to call him and his brother in. He said Dad, LOOK AT THAT!!, and his Dad took a long look at it, then called his wife and the older sister out to look. By this time, the light had crossed 1/2 the horizon, but was still very high (in space?). Soon thereafter it stopped moving, and after hanging there for 15 secs. or so, it began dropping smaller yellow lights out of the bottom, one after the other. The lights were about 1/10 the size of the larger light. It proceeded to drop about fifteen of these. The craft was at about 10:00 high, and these smaller lights would each disappear at about 08:30 high. When they began disappearing, the number of them and the realization that they could fly over us invisibly made my knees start to wobble and give out from fear- the only time in my life that has happened. After the last of the lights fell, four lights simultaneously broke off the object at each corner or quadrant, then fell to the same area and disappeared. After that the entire craft just blinked out. I looked around the neighborhood, and some other neighbors saw this as they! were ou tside watering the grass and others working on a car.

Saw light travelling across sky;1980-06-15 22:00:00;5 min;SUMMARY:  Saw light travelling across sky I saw a white light at very high altitude travelling across the sky.I thought it was a satellite until it made a sharp 90 degree turn. I have seen MIR and what I saw back in 1980 looked just like it.The only thing I can't explain is the sharp 90 degree turn. It could have been an ICBM launched from nearby White Sands Missle range with a target at a Nevada test range. This was common back then and may still be.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463

The light was comparable to a dim light bulb, it flew parallel to power lines running to the east and over a power plant.  When the light reached the power lines it became an intense bluish color and pulsed. I paced the light in a vehicle at about 50mph. Upon reaching a power line juncture (intersection of three high power lines) the light appeared to stop and looked to be turning towards my direction  and became brighter then was instantly gone (disappeared). Sky was clear with clear star background. Distance followed was about 3 miles.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
A distant ball of blue and orange light that disappeared after rapidly moving at a downward angle.;2003-07-27 00:10:00;3 seconds;A distant ball of blue and orange light that disappeared after rapidly moving at a downward angle. We were driving down the mountain when we saw a bright blue and orange light coming at a diagonal from the sky to the earth's surface.  It did not leave any trail but was moving at a very high speed.  The bright light then suddenly disappeared but did so before getting anywhere near the earth.  There were no clouds near the object in the sky so the light was clearly visible.  The object just appeared to be a ball of light that left no debris as it traveled. ((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain whether the sighting occurred during daylight hours, or whether it occurred just after midnight.  We will attempt to verify the time.

The white lights were about the same size as the nearby stars but much brighter. They didn’t move at all, the brightest one was top left the other was bottom right about half inch apart, 45 degrees angle. This isn’t the first time I’ve seen lights in the south east sky over El Paso. About a year ago ( November) around the same time 8 to 9 PM. I’ve seen a very bright light about the size of a green pea, flared out with a black object in the middle.The light lit up the surrounding night sky and shrink down to a very small round white object streaked off . I thought I should file a report.. Thanks for your time.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
Yellow ball of light following a commercial airliner.;2010-07-25 21:20:00;1 minute;Yellow ball of light following a commercial airliner. At approximately 9:20 p.m. on July 25, 2010, in El Paso, TX, I was on my apartment balcony observing an incoming commercial airliner flying from the east to west as it was making a descent to land at our local airport.  The night sky was clear, other than the clouds in the north.  It is difficult to judge the airplane's altitude, though I could see its underside in detail.  As the plane flew directly above my apartment complex, I noticed a yellow ball of light dart into a position behind the plane's tail where it began to follow the plane for about 4 seconds. The ball of light was about the size of the airplane's tail section.  The light did not seem to produce a noise, though it was difficult to know since I could only hear the sound of the plane's engines.  After it trailed the plane for a short time, the ball of light veered off in a northerly direction, and at times flew erraticly (suddenly slowing down, then speeding up). I estimate the light was traveling at least twice as fast as the plane. I continued to track the ball of light until it faded into the clouds in the north.  It was obvious to me that this ball of light was not another airplane, considering it was not displaying blinking lights, nor was it at a safe distance between the plane I was observing. This incident has great significance to me, especially having read about the increase in fireball reports recently.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
Strange star-like object hovering over El Paso mountains, almost hit car and swooped down below the road (on mountain) disappearing.;2010-08-08 22:00:00;10 minutes;Strange star-like object hovering over El Paso mountains, almost hit car and swooped down below the road (on mountain) disappearing. I was sitting outside at night with 3 other people in my backyard. It was around 10:40PM or so, nearing 11PM. From my backyard I am able to see a view of the El Paso mountains in the distance, and am able to see Transmountain Road, which is a long road that is a shortcut to get from the northeast side of town to the west side by cutting through rather than going around the mountain.  From our view you can see the headlights driving by from the cars in a certain area that drive by, but they are high up in elevation on the lower half of the mountain from the view we have. Two of us (myself and another) were sitting in the backyard facing away from the mountain, while the other two were sitting able to view the mountains and transmountain road, and one of them noticed this faint light above the mountains, she pointed and asked what it was, it was probably a hundred feet above or so, not sure but it was high up enough to look like a star, because that's what we thought it was. Thankfully, she didn't believe it was a star - and kept staring at it and suddenly told us it was moving, so we all turned to focus on it, it was so faint we didn't think anything of it for a couple of minutes except it was this hazy purple, it was the exact coloring if you stare at a black light, you can't really focus on it and it had this purple tone to it.  We thought there might be a cloud in front, but it was a clear night, the object was hazy. So trying to focus on it in the sky, we can begin to see this faint purple/blue light begins to slowly move, side to side, diagonally, in very unusual patterns at different speeds, and then it began to slowly fly behind the mountain, and as we watched it, for about 5 to 10 seconds it went out of sight.  We thought that was all there was to it, but we stayed looking, we all kind of wished it would come back, and we got our wish... It suddenly came back up and began to float down the mountain but it moves down in different ways, at first it went straight down and then diagonally, just erratic movements and it suddenly gets closer to the cars that are driving on transmountain, so we see this faint purple light get closer and closer to the cars and two of us are really scared that it will crash down, but the other two people with me tried to get out a really bad telescope of mine that didn't work properly - but hoping to be able to use it to see what this object is!  Then it suddenly pauses in front of one of the cars, almost like the object hit the brakes and it lights up so brightly I squinted, and we all just gasped in awe and fear. Then immediately it shot down below the road into the base of the mountain near an area that has no residential homes, it shot down from the right, then to the left and then out of sight. Being so scared we were expecting to see it come back up into the sky, maybe even fly over us but thankfully nothing.  We called into the non emergency phone line in El Paso to ask if anyone had seen strange lights, and they told us no. After that, a day later we went up to Transmountain to see if we could see anything below in the desert, and of course we found nothing unusual looking. I've seen in the mid 90's strange objects in the sky over Ft. Bliss (military base) area which is east of where I lived, objects that would blink and shine light onto the roof of the house in front of ours (without any sound, like a helicopter light should have), but never have I seen this black light colored object, erratically flying around near where a lot of cars drive back and forth 24/7, and if it was anything government made, we wondered why it would be so close to cars, seemed dangerous.  I just wonder if the drivers on Transmountain saw the object, because when it lit up so bright it seemed everyone would have been able to see it!  But it seems nobody noticed it but us that night, and we stayed out for many nights after that hoping to see it again but we haven't yet.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
white light, zoom away;2010-08-11 03:00:00;about 2 mins;white light, zoom away I was on my way to work as usual at about 3 am. Every morning before I get into my car I look at the sky since I like looking at the stars. You could see them pretty well that early in the morning even with all the city lights.  It all seemed very normal. While i was driving a cop started following me. I looked in the rear view mirror to look at him them back at the road. That's when i noticed the star.  It seemed like it moved. It wasn't a shooting star or a meteor . It was just a static white light, no pulsing, no color changes, and no movement. While i was looking at it, it zoomed away.  This movement didn't look normal. The light smeared across the sky. The best way i can describe it is the way the stars look in movies when they go light speed. While it zoomed away the color and the shape were the same just elongated. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Objects in the El Paso Sky;2011-10-23 13:00:00;15-20 mins;Objects in the El Paso Sky Event: At approximately 1300 hrs on 23 October 2011, my wife and I witnessed 6-7 objects to our north in the backyard of our El Paso home.  The objects were in a dispersed pattern with no apparent organization.  The only relationship the objects appeared to have was that they began disappearing at the same time.  The were fairly stationary, moving very little and after watching for approximately 8 minutes, 2-3 objects began to ascend into the sky.  The objects began fading after witnessing for 15 minutes and after 20 minutes they were no longer visible with the naked eye. Object Description: The objects were quite a distance away, perhaps about 10-15 miles away.  They appeared small, but again their exact size was hard to judge from such a distance.  They were very shiny almost appearing as aluminum foil floating in the air.  They were very brilliant as they were visible in the peak of daylight. Weather: The weather was clear, and I do mean clear, I did not count a single cloud in the sky.  The temperature was approximately 87F, with the wind blowing less than 5 knots from the east. Aerial Traffic: I witnessed multiple civilian aircraft going to and from ELP International flowing along their typical landing/departure pattern.  There was also an air show underway at Biggs Army Airfield, the air show was NOT visible from my home.  The craft in the sky were not parachutes, as they did not descend they remained stationary occasionally ascending higher into the sky.  They were also not aircraft flares as they did not descend.  Civilian transport aircraft even seemed to fly amongst the objects at one point to avoid the temporary flight restrictions over Biggs Army Air Field.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463

Two solid white lights in a straight line formation silently moving to the NE across far NE El Paso;2016-04-05 19:55:00;5 minutes;Two solid white lights in a straight line formation silently moving to the NE across far NE El Paso Located in far Northeast El Paso, near Railroad Dr and Farah Dr, while star gazing, two solid white lights appeared overhead out of nowhere and moved in a straight line formation, one behind the other, to the northeast for just a short distance for about 5 minutes and disappeared. It was a clear night with no clouds.  It was a calm, windless night and there was no detectable sound from the lights passing overhead.  There were no associated blinking or colored lights as on an aircraft. The lights were brighter and more focused than stars, and were flying at an altitude far lower than high planes yet higher than any low planes.  The lights moved straight ahead with no side to side movement, and traveled too fast to be a high altitude plane or a satellite, but slower than a low altitude plane. The lights were in a straight line formation too far apart to be just a single plane.  Although no associated shape was detected, it seemed as if the lights were positioned with one at the front and one at the back. What was so startling and attention-getting was that the direction of travel was entirely not in keeping with the normal flight paths of either ELP or Biggs Army Airfield, nor of the high altitude commercial flight paths crossing El Paso.  The witness is a nightly observer of the constellations and the local commercial and Army flight paths across Northeast El Paso.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
