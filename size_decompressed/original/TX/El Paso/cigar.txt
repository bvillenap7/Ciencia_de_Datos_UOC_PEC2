UFO with five army helicopters following it over FT BLISS.;1997-07-11 18:00:00;5hours;UFO with five army helicopters following it over FT BLISS We were on our way to a restaurant when my sister pointed out a silvery/white cigar shaped object in the sky.  It was still and somewhat blended into the partly cloudy sky, but you could make it out.  It stayed still in the sky for a very long while and even after we came out of the restaurant it was still there.  People were calling into the radio station that we were listening to talk and just rant about the strange object in the sky  So it was a fact that numerous people had seen this thing in the sky, but there were no military crafts around it.  Then the sun set and the objected move towards the military base where were stationed at even over our neighborhood.  There were about five ARMY HELICOPTERS surrounding it and the object was VERY LOW about the same level as the helicopters.  The object's light was glowing red, purple, yellow and blue and it kept changing colors.  It looked as if maybe the objected landed but im not sure. The object disappeared and then so did the army helicopters.  I saw this thing so close up it was something out of a movie with the helicopters following its every move.  There was nothing on the news or in the papers about this.  My whole family witnessed it not to mention all the people that called into the radio station.

Cigar shaped object in eastern sky.;2003-01-16 07:26:00;15-20 seconds;Cigar shaped object in eastern sky. At 7:26 this morning I was pulling out of my driveway to take my children to school.  As I pulled out I noticed a very bright object in the eastern sky. At first, because of its location directly above the sun, the object appeared to resemble a bright ball of light in the sky.  But after a few seconds the object started to move to the northeast revealing its true shape, which resembled a cigar. The object was tilted at a 45 degree angle as it moved through the sky. I can only guess the altitude or distance it was from us, but from what we saw it was a very big object.  It continued to move east/northeast and eventually disappeared. I did not literally see it disappear or shoot off towards the eastern sky, I discribe it this way because I turned my head to yell at my wife, who was in the garage, to look at the UFO and as I turned back to look at the object it was gone. There was also a plane in eastern sky, but it was far off in the distance.  My 12 year old daughter also witnessed the entire event.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
cigar shaped craft hovering over the neighborhood;2003-05-14 04:30:00;5 mins;cigar shaped craft hovering over the neighborhood After delivering newspapers I was headed to another person's home at 4:30 am. As I headed down the residentual street a large craft appeared.  It was hovering and had white lights on top and red lights on the back- kinda like the back of a car.  It was very large and I ran to the house and woke up my friends who came out and were flabergasted at the sight.  We stood in the middle of the road watching it go slowly back and forth.  my friend's wife ran into the house to get a camera and by the time she came out the craft just disappeared.  It was huge, almost 5 times the size of a large aircraft.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463

Cigar-shaped UFO moving south-southwest towards Mexico;2008-11-14 10:00:00;10 minutes;Cigar-shaped UFO moving south-southwest towards Mexico I was walking into the motor pool when I noticed something in the sky.  The motor pool is very near El Paso airport, and I have an interest in aircraft, so I stopped to look at it.  It was traveling south-southwest in a sort of drifting manner.  It was brown, and cigar-shaped.  I waited for its angle to change to determine if it was a helicopter (a common sight patrolling the border), but it's shape was too evenly cigar shaped so I was certain it was not a Blackhawk, and it seemed to lack the vertical stabilizer and wings of fixed-wing aviation, so I stood there and stared at it. It was not at a very high elevation, maybe 1000 feet above the ground (I'm not a trained aerial observer, so I can't gauge elevation at all), and it seemed to be just drifting over the border, like a dirigible, though it's path was even and consistently south-southwest. I pointed it out to some of my comrades as I was seeing it, but they apparently didn't see it.  I lost track of it when I had to get back to what I was doing.
