Triangles over the Golf Course;1990-06-15 20:00:00;30 minutes;Triangles over the Golf Course My partner and I lived in an apartment complex next door to the Lee Trevino Golf Course in El Paso Texas.  We would walk our dog on this golf course at night.  On this evening, we watched as several lit triangle craft appeared over the city lights.  The craft appeared to hover and then move swiftly either to the left or to the right.   Always they returned to the center of where they initially appeared.   We eventually got tired of watching this and went inside.  We never reported the event but we did keep a watch for these craft over the next few months.   We did not see them again.

THE MOON WAS IN THE SSW OF THE SKY AND JUST TO THE EAST OF THE MOON WAS A VAGUE RED CIRCULAR OBJECT THAT APPEARED TO BE POSSIBLE A CLOUD BUT IT WAS MOVING SLOWLY TO THE NORTH. I WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND GOT MY WIFE TO TAKE A LOOK SO THAT I WOULD NOT BE THE ONLY WITNESS. SHE RETURNED TO THE BACK YARD WITH ME AND VERIFIED WHAT I HAD SEEN. THE OBJECT CONTINUED TO MOVE TO THE NORTH DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. MY WIFE ASKED ME WHERE MY BINOCULARS WERE. I RETRIEVED THEM FROM THE HOUSE AND LOCATED THE OBJECT. THROUGH THE BINOCULARS I WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE RED OBJECT WAS INDEED BALL SHAPED TRAILED TO THE BACK AND TO THE EITHER SIDE TWO WHITE BALL SHAPED LIGHTS WHICH FORMED A TRIANGLE. DURING ALL THE TIME I OBSERVED THIS OBJECT IT WAS MOVING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION. ONE OF THE WHITE LIGHTS WENT OUT AND ONLY THE RED AND ONE OF THE WHITE BALLS CONTINUED THEIR NORTHERLY MOVEMENT. I LOST VIEW OF THE OBJECT (OBJECTS) IN THE NNE SKY AFTER WATCHING FOR 15 TO 20 MINUTES. THIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE HUGE AND AT AN EXTREME ALTITUDE. ITS DIRECTION NEVER VARIED AS WENT WENT FROM THE SSW TO THE NNE. THE LIGHT WHEN FIRST OBSERVED WAS VERY DIM AND IT WAS BY PURE CHANCE THAT I WAS ABLE TO SEE IT. THERE WERE THREE LIGHTS WHICH LATER DIMINISHED TO TWO. THE LEAD LIGHT WAS RED AND CIRCULAR AND THE TWO TRAILING LIGHTS WERE WHITE AND CIRCULAR. THEY STAYED EQUAL DISTANT FROM EACH OTHER AND WHEN ONE OF THE WHITE LIGHTS FADED OUT THE LEADING RED AND REMAINING WHITE LIGHT REMAINED THE SAME DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER. THE OBJECT FINALLY FADED OUT AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES IN THE NORTHERN SKY. THIS SEEMED TO BE A TRIANGULAR SHAPED OBJECT WITH A RED LIGHT LEADING, FOLLOWED BY TWO WHITE LIGHTS ON EITHER SIDE.

A triangular object that didnt make a sound seen at a low level around El Paso;2004-01-12 18:35:00;7 mins;A triangular object that didnt make a sound seen at a low level around El Paso I was coming from my med school in Juarez, Mexico and entering one of the main intersections of El Paso (where I live). The street i was on was executive boulevard when i first saw a strange object. In El Paso there are big mountains around the area. I was at a stop light and looked up to the mountain area and thought i was wondering why the radio tower i saw looked slightly big. Now remember it was dark around this time. Then i realized that  it wasnt the radio tower that i usually see up on the mountain. It seemed like a triangular object floating. Ive had a great interest in UFO's for the past few years but i always knew that if i was ever to report an UFO to anyone that i wanted to make it under the most objective standards. I realized that it couldnt have been a helicopter since there wasnt a sound at all and the outlining shape seemed to be triangular. I do live around a military base called fort bliss and they sometimes fly helicopters but you will always hear them. There was no way it could have been a plane since the flight pattern taken by this object seemed to be straight for a little bit, seemed to have stayed a little stationary and then sort of zig-zagged. Iam not an expert on planes or helicopters but i usually see these things fly a straight path. I thought that this object could have been a blimp but it seemed too low for a blimp. I always have this notion that blimps are flown during day time. Anaways the lights emanating from this object werent too bright. I dont remember the number of lights but they were definiteley blinking. I had another eyewitness who was in a car next to my car. I rolled down my window to ask him if he saw what  i saw. He was perplexed. He said he couldnt believe what he saw and he said he didnt know what it was. I wish i could have stopped to him and maybe talked to him for a little while aobut this experience but there was too much traffic. Anaways i tried to chase this object and when i did i could see it in the horizon for a few more minutes ! and then i just couldnt catch up to it anymore since i would have to take a dirt road to see where this object was going.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463

Triangular blueish lights seen over El Paso, TX.;2009-05-27 23:00:00;30 sec;Triangular blueish lights seen over El Paso, TX. Three lights in blueish color were seen in El Paso, TX roughly at 2300.  Lights were seen for a short time above cloud cover.  I was unable to see the actual shape but the lights did reflect threw the clouds . The lights were shaped in a trianular pattern.  As I looked up i noticed the lights but heard no engine noise and did not see a red blinking light associated with commercial or military aircraft. When I turned away the lights travel towards the north west so quick that I lost visual contact with the lights in the clouds, I tried to locate them again in a cloud break but was unable to see it again. I have no type of video or photograph item with me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
Triangular craft spotted.;2019-04-20 21:20:00;15 minutes;Triangular craft spotted.  I have reported this case to the MUFON and received no response despite hours of phone interviews. Months later I had to contact the investigator only to be told that what I saw was indeed unidentified.  I have amazing video of what I saw, strange occurrences in the sky within the following day, and strange occurrences that have happened to me after.  On the night of April 20, 2019, I was driving down my neighborhood street to the corner gas station. It was a clear, dark desert night. There are no tall trees or obstructions in this area.  When I was driving, I saw an odd light pattern in the sky that caught my interest, but as I was driving I was unable to stop.  I spent roughly fifteen minutes at the corner store before proceeding back home on the same path I had come.  At this time, 9:20 PM, I saw the light pattern again and I was able to safely stop and record. I have a twenty-second video, but I watched for around 10-15 minutes before I could no longer see. What I saw was triangular, with three white lights. The craft was low, too low to be considered normal. Too slow to be considered normal. Too quiet to be considered normal. It would stop for seconds, it would disappear for seconds. It just seemed as it was lazily passing over the neighborhood. It should be noted that there is an airport in my city as well as an Army base, but both are considerably far from where the incident occurred.  Very odd things followed for months that I do not wish to publish here but will discuss with a NUFORC member. I truly believe I have caught a UFO in film and the events surrounding will only support the story. I am a scientific person to my core and I have grown up on military bases, so I would not jump to far-fetched conclusions unless I really believed.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
Small triangular pattern of three wwhite lights hovering very high over the west side of El Paso, TX.;2020-05-11 22:00:00;30 minutes;Small triangular pattern of three wwhite lights hovering very high over the west side of El Paso, TX. On Monday 5/11/2020 at around 10 pm MST in El Paso, TX my 3 family members and I observed a small triangular pattern of three white lights hovering very high in the sky over the west side of El Paso.  Our home is on the east side of El Paso, very close to the El Paso International Airport.  So, we were viewing the lights from east to west over the tops of the Mount Franklin mountain range.  The three lights would flash / twinkle randomly and occasionally remain solid.  The three lights did not separate from the triangular pattern and after about 30 minutes they completely disappeared.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
