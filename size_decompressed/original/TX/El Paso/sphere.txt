15 minute event, daytime, partly cloudy, 5/30/1999, El Paso, Texas, 1:15P.M.;1999-05-30 13:10:00;15Min;15 minute event, daytime, partly cloudy, 5/30/1999, El Paso, Texas, 1:15P.M. 	Before I begin I swear that the following events did occur on May 30, 1999 at approximately 1:15p.m. for about 15 minutes. 	I was on my back looking up. I was getting a tan. I noticed a small white point of light. It did not look like a plane I retreived my camera which I was using just a few minutes earlier. I notice only one at first. I was a bit nervous and forgot to remove auto focus. I proceeded to film the object. Trying to get a good zoom, when I pulled out I noticed a second object. At first they appearded to be moving apart I keep losing the focus. When I refocused later I notice they were closer and seemed to pass each other at quite a close range. I was thinking to myself if they were planes that would have been a near miss. My girlfriend was also observing the object. I notice the battey was going to die so I positioned myself behind a electircal wire so the object would pass behind an object. I knew that is a good way to do measurements. And to see that the object was actually in the atmosphere. Til the object reached the edge of the fence. After reviewing the film I noticed I actually filmed 3 objects. One of which I did not notice with my naked eye. When you look a the film you will notice the 3rd object on the left of the film in one of the zoom outs of the 2 objects I saw visually. Then a few seconds later on the upper left corner on a few frames. Very faint but very noiceable on the film. 	I was filming the object on a brand new Sony Handycam Model: CCD-TR416 W/180X Zoom and Night Vision. Filmed TDK HS120 Metal Paticle Tape Super Finavinx-Metal Particle 8mm video cassette. Thank you.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
Spheres in a triangular formation over the skies of El Paso, TX show their beauty as well as their capabilities and intelligence.;2000-07-19 13:00:00;2 hrs;Spheres in a triangular formation over the skies of El Paso, TX show their beauty as well as their capabilities and intelligence. I work for a locksmith shop in EL Paso, Tx. The date of the incident was July 19, 2000 around 1:00 PM. My self and an accompanied employee stopped at our 1 O'clock appointment on Robinson Street in Central El Paso. My employee and I approached the front door of the residence when he noticed up in the sky next to the sun a triangular formation of three spherical dots. We stood there in auh and wondered what they were. The customer of ours answered the door to greet us. She wondered what it was we were looking at so she looked up too. Her gesture was, maybe they are Harrier Jet planes Hovering. In response I told her, Yeah, but where are the wings. These dots just hovered in that triangular formation without moving for about 10 mins. My employee went inside to see what it was she needed and I stayed there looking at them. After those 10 minutes past, there was a first visible sign of movement. The dot north of the triangular formation moved through the formation in a southeasterly direction and did not stopped until all three dots were in a single line formation. There were two dots close to one another still in their orignal positions and the third dot which had moved southeastern was further in distance from the other two. I could not believe what I was seeing. I then went inside the home to help my employee with the work. I wondered what it was I was seeing and remebered thinking to myself, is this what I think they are. I went to the back yard of the house and looked up in the sky. The two dots that were next to each other were gone and the third dot in the south was still there. But the more I looked at it, it seemed to brighten up as the powerful reflection from the sun was bouncing off of it silvery in color. It almost seemed to grow in size because of the expansion of the reflection of light. I know El Paso fairly well. I've lived here all my life. The path that the dot had taken southeasterly was in the direction towards lower southeast El Paso. I figured that the dot maybe ! was hovering between 15,000-to 30,000 feet above the ground. Because there patches of clouds in the vicnity of the dot. The direction I was looking in was towards southeast El Paso where Zaragosa Drive is, which is about 20 miles from where I was. That's about the distance the UFO was from me, I suppose. I stood there for about 15 minutes, after that I went inside through the house to go out the front door to our service vehicle. My employee was in the back of our truck changing the locks. I looked towards the southeastern sky again and notice the dot was gone. The way El Paso is divided is like any other city. We have sections like central, west, east and northeast. The very last tip of the Rocky Mountain chain stops in Central El Paso. The mountain divides the city in two major halves east and west. From there you get the rest of the sections here in El Paso I mentioned. Well, by now I was looking in all directions at the sky and could not see a thing. My employee asked me, what was that. I told him joking maybe they were UFO's. He laughed and so did I. We continued to work. The house faced south into Mexico and we had backed the truck in to have better access from the house. My employee was changing the locks and I was standing outside the truck with my back to the north. My employee looked over to me and then he noticed a dot moving from west to east from the north slowly under a cloud that was low in altitude. He screamed to me to look. I saw the dot moving in that direction and as it reached the mountain it just suddenly turned south, traveled a small distance and stopped below another dot we had not noticed was there. I thought, these cannot possibly be balloons because there was stiff breeze west to east that was moving through El Paso. Only something with some type of propoltion can change directions like that. Looking at the two dots they seemed to be getting smaller, both of them at the same time, which meant they were traveling upward towards space. Eventually they faded out into the blue! atmosphere. After that, all of a sudden, in the same path, position and direction, maybe atltitude west to east from the north a dot was traveling again. This time it went straight over the mountain to the east and disappeared. By this time I was feeling previledge at what I was witnessing. Hard to believe, Yes, but not impossible. As we were trying to finish that job I called my uncle and told him what I was seeing. He was shocked. At that same time I looked up in the sky, because a large circular cloud covered the sun. An aurora of light on the egde of cloud emitted. If you ever seen a desert sky during the summer, the sky is very bright and hard to look up without squinting. At the northern edge of the cloud two dots appeared and stayed a certain distance from the cloud. As the cloud moved east, so did the the two dots. They seemed to dance with the cloud, but at the same time the distance between tehmselves and the cloud never changed. If the cloud slowly rotated, so did they. This cloud as it was moving still covered the sun. I was still on the phone with my uncle telling him to look up in the sky towards that cloud where the sun was. I guess where he was he could see the dots. Anyways, when the sun was about to pierce out the egde of the cloud the most northern of the two dots seemed to have changed shape as it moved south above and over the cloud. It looked as if it were tumlbing. I could see this tumbling motion because of the reflection of the sunlight from it. Then, as it reached the south side of cloud still tumbling, it literally vanished from my eyes. I did not see it fly away up, down or sideways. It just vanished. We finally finished the job and traveled to another job site. As we were driving down the road from where we were, I could still see those dots traveling in all directions. I was dismayed and disarrayed but, I felt wonderful and previledged to have witnessed the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life (other than my child being born). Before this incident I always looke! d up in the sky, not because I was trying to find UFO's, but because I love jets. I never stop looking up, but now I know what to look for and where. The reason I say this, is because I have seen on eight different occasions after that day, the spherical type of UFO phenomenon. How beautiful!!;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463

I was going out to the payphone this morning and noticed something shining in the sky, i called my son over to see it and asked if he could see it.he said yes so i assumed it was a plane , but i kept my eye on it. while i was on the phone I noticed another plane however this one was leaving a trail i looked over at what i thought was a plane and no trail at all it was a cold morning as well. when the glare was off of it it appeared round. when i went back to my door it dissapeared. Shortly after this thing was gone NASA's planes started flying around.we have a small NASA training center here they have those zero gravity traing jets and a couple of what look like f-15 jets camoflauged in light blues these are the ones i saw flyin around right after that thing disappeared;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
silver shpere climbed slowly then shrank away and disappeared.;2005-03-01 16:00:00;three seconds;silver shpere climbed slowly then shrank away and disappeared. The time is approximate. We were driving in the northeast area of town, quite populated, when my wife said look in the sky! There was a small (looked about the size of a pencil eraser) silver orb in the sky near the mountains (Franklin Mts.). We were pulling into a gas station when this happened. It moved from where it was to the upper left slowly and then seemed to shrink to nothing and disappear.  Shadow could be seen as if on a orb-shaped ball.  The skies were mostly clear with wispy clouds. Airliner planes were in the air too from the local airport but didn't pay it any attention.  We were at the intersection of Dyer St. and Hondo Pass. Please leave a message if you call. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume the source of the report implies a daytime sighting.  We have amended the time above to 16:00 hrs..

Black sphere with flame light seen over loop 375 El Paso, Texas.;2020-05-09 20:30:00;45 sec;Black sphere with flame light seen over loop 375 El Paso, Texas. I was driving home and noticed what appeared to be a red flame about 300 yards in the sky. The flame  (reddish/orange in color) light, traveling north over loop 375 looked a little blurry so I parked and continued to observe to flame but still looked blurry. The flame light appeared to fade out as the light turned west, then noticed the large dark (black) sphere shape appear with the reflection of the city lights. The sphere was about the size of a large two story house (possibly larger), continued to travel west bound.  The sphere did not have lights or sound to indicate it was a plane.;31.7830181140953;-106.39398739463
