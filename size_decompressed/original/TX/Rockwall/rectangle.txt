Rectangular object soaring silently with no lights or sound and with a digital camouflage pattern;2011-04-25 21:52:00;8-12 seconds;Rectangular object soaring silently with no lights or sound and with a digital camouflage pattern My wife and I were sitting outside on our patio on 4/25/11 at 9:52 pm when we saw a rectangular shaped object soaring silently from southeast to northwest.  It is difficult to estimate the size or how high it was.  The object could be seen clearly and it was not rotating, making noise or illuminated.  My wife believes it was roughly 200’ x 200’ and was flying at roughly 1500’.  I believe it was much larger and was flying closer to 1 mile.   The object appeared to be in a liquid state, such as the chemical mercury, but it retained its parallelogram shape throughout the sighting.  It appeared to only be reflecting the lights from the ground, and had no lights on the craft itself.  The object had a digital camouflaged appearance of a circuit board or other layered pattern.  It was dark outside with few clouds and the stars were shining brightly.  There were no other aircraft in the vicinity.   The object made no noise and flew in a straight line and was faster than any ai! rcraft I have ever personally seen.  We live in an area with little surrounding lights from our community.  Neither my wife nor myself have ever seen anything like this and have never witnessed any unidentified object.  We have lived at this home for eleven years and spend every evening outside with our small dog.  We live on a small 1 acre estate and have a perimeter fence and gate.  The view was unobstructed.  I have lived in Rockwall County, Texas, for 39 years and have never heard anyone mention a sighting before this.;32.9380167938929;-96.4358890076332
Black slightly transparent rectangular UFO in Rockwall, Texas.;2011-05-29 12:00:00;3 minutes;Black slightly transparent rectangular UFO in Rockwall, Texas. I was driving in Rockwall during lunch time traffic with kids on Ridge Road, when I spotted a black yet transparent (?) square UFO.  It was pretty high and no movement at first.  I pointed it out to my teenage daughter since I was trying to drive and she kept up with it.   It was sitting just on the other side of interstate 30 on the right.   At first I thought maybe it was an advertisement but it was very high in the sky.   Once we passed under 30 on Ridge road it was gone.  I searched online to see if anyone else had seen it today and noticed one mentioned last month that fits the description perfectly in the same town!;32.9380167938929;-96.4358890076332
