They thought it was a remote control airplane at first, then it got closer and was an oval/diamond shape.  They tried to catch it and it began to change shape and size. It was at times less than 8 inches in diameter and grew to be larger than a car before it instantaneously took off.  On 1-25-04, last Friday morning, it reappeared with two other craft. One was what they called christmas tree shaped and it had a bright yellow/white light beam the others did not have.The other was cigar shaped like a plane and had a tail like a plane, but no wings. The three crafts seemed to play with the children and were circling each other.  The children got on the school bus and while discussing it, they said another child overheard and began describing the same thing saying he saw it a few streets over. I have had experiences myself, so has my mother and I kept this from the children.  Until they described the mini ufos  I had never heard of this, however my research on the internet backs up what they have told me. These are smart girls that are not prone to making things up. The younger had also had a dream that Thursday night about an alien in a ship and that it had a tube connecting to her for what she says is reading her mind.  But she says that was just a dream and is very clear in making that distinction.  I have heard strange sounds around the house lately and the dogs have been very disturbed.  I have been trying to research  if anyone else in Rockwall or surrounding areas saw the same thing that day or recently.  I did not find anything other than a similar sighting in Indiana that same morning.;32.9380167938929;-96.4358890076332
