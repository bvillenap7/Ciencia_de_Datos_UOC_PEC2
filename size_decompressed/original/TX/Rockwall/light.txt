LOOKED AS IF IT WAS SITUATED IN THE MILKY WAY AND IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING W/SLIGHT MOVEMENT WHEN I CAME HOME FROM THE GROCERY STORE MY BOYFRIEND WAS OUT IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE WAITING FOR ME AT APPROX. 8:00 PM.   HE CALLED ME OUTSIDE WITH HIM.  I WENT OUT AND MY BOYFRIEND POINTED TO THE SKY.  IN THE SKY WAS A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT.  BRIGHTER THAN ANY STAR IN THE SKY.  THE LIGHT HELD IN its PRESENCE A GREENISH RING AROUND IT AND IT LOOKED AS IF IT WAS SITUATED IN THE MILKY WAY,  AS IF THERE WERE TINY LITTLE STARS ALL AROUND THE LIGHT COMBINED WITH THE GREENISH RING.  THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING WITH THE SLIGHEST OF MOVEMENT.  THERE WAS A LOT OF ACTIVITY WITH AIRPLANES IN THE AREA AND THE OBJECT WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT AN AIRPLANE.   WE WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE WE WENT INSIDE.  WE WENT BACK OUTSIDE AND THE OBJECT WAS GONE. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));32.9380167938929;-96.4358890076332
