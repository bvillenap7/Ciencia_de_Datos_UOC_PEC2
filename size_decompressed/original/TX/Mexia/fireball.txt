flaming ball of fire;2004-01-27 07:20:00;app. 3 min.;flaming ball of fire Tuesday morning on a clear day I was on my way to work with my two girls to pick up my cousins little girl.  When we pulled up to the house we saw an orange round fireball, it was almost like it was on fire.  I then turned and asked my girls if they see what I see, they said Yes.  So when my cousins little girl got into the car I asked her if she could see it, she said Yes.   We thought for sure that a plane was on fire until we saw a military jet flying north turn and chase the object.  We followed them until they both vanished in the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at a contrail behind a high-altitude airliner, which was being brightly illuminated by the rising sun.  Such events are reported to our Center on a frequent basis.  PD));31.6774;-96.4929
