Red flashing lights in Sullivan City, TX.;2010-02-12 21:00:00;4 min;Red flashing lights in Sullivan City, TX. I was traveling east along HWY 83 in Sullivan City, TX, when I noticed a strange formation of blinking lights.  Saw three red lights blinking one after another in a vertical line slanted backward that were also going east parallel to highway.  I kept my eye on it for 2-3 minutes trying to figure out if the unusual lights were part of a helicopter or plane.  The object then starting heading south and lights disappeared.;26.2702;-98.5647
