My cousin and I were coming back from a party. It was realy late so we had to hurry home. As we were walking, i looked up to see one bluish light almost directly above me. Almost immediatly after, to other lights came together to form a triangle. As it hovered, it went around in a circle. I was too scared to actually count the seconds it lasted, so 30 sec. is the closest approximation I could give. After a while the lights just dissapeared.;31.135;-97.7759999999999
Bright light moving fast and stopping over a Military base.;2000-07-19 22:35:00;2 sec.;Bright light moving fast and stopping over a Military base. On 19 July 2000 around 22:35 hrs. I was driving West on Hwy 190, coming from Belton Tx. While I came down a long sloping hill. I saw a bright light came in from the South and was going to the North over Fort Hood Texas. It came in fast and at high arch. It left no trail like a Metor. It was just a bright dot of light. It looked to have stopped and went out over Fort Hood. It was moving too fast to be an aircraft. Est. distance it traveled 60 miles in 2 sec.;31.135;-97.7759999999999

moving lights, and faded objects, explosions.;2007-08-23 21:11:00;1 hour;moving lights, and faded objects, explosions. This is my second post on here, but today there were more witnesses and this time we even got the footage on camera!  After the sighting lastnight we decided to do some research to see if there have been anymore sightings in our area. Well what we found was a surprise. It came out to be over 50 sightings in our same area since 1985. First sighted in 1940. All the records reported back then describes exactly what we saw the past two nights.  Walking down from the same house, we looked in between the two houses where the first sighting was. This light stayed for quite a few minutes, then it slowly began to move left. While it was moving it dropped out another light.. like fire. Then the light that was dropped faded. The orignial light continues to flow left and then it slowly fades away itself. Due ot the fading away we believed it was a flare. Expecailly since we live next to the military base (fort hood). Thinking it was training of the soldiers we called the MP's and they told us that there was no trainging happening at that time. Making us more curious we stayed outside to watch for the lights. Eventually we saw the sky light up red. After afew flashes of red came the original objects appeard in the original spot. Only this time around it was 4 in one place at one time. Each time one light would fade another object would appear... but yet in the exact same location as the others. Each time one would fade, another one would drop out fire. Not knowing what this was we dug out the binoculars. To our surprise it came out that the objects were NOT flares and yet the stuff that was being dropped was fire. After awhile the objects themselves exploded. We decided to chase after the lights to get our answer on what it was. As we got closer and closer we noticed that the fire would just drop behind the hills. We got to the point where we were too close, and being alone at night in one car we decided to go home. When we got home we looked up videos online of UFO's and came upon videos of exactly what we have recorded... Now you tell me what it is?  Yet when the police here says its flares. We want an answer. And yet until we find it we will sit out everynight and get this on camera.;31.135;-97.7759999999999
