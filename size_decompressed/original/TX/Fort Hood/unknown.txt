It looked like it was approximately 1000 ft up. We saw it cross and stop in mid-air. It shined a beam of light down on us for about what seemed like 1 minute, and then it cut the light off and cut it back on about 2-5 miles away. We were sitting on a M1-A1 Abrams tank when this happened. After it turned the light off the second time the object shot straight up and out of sight.;31.135;-97.7759999999999
