Spinning discs in West For Hood, TX;1998-11-01 13:00:00;15 seconds;Spinning discs in West For Hood, TX I was driving into West Fort Hood, near the airfied.  I had passed the Radar Hill test site and saw two plateau's in the distance that met with a dip in the middle.  I noticed a silver disc over each top of the plateau.  They were spinning so very fast. The light was reflecting off them, that is how I saw that they were spinning. I stopped the car, and watched.  They met in the middle over the dip in the plateau, seemed to fuse as one and SHOT straight up immediately and were out of sight. If I had blinked, I would have missed them going straight up. I was raised to believe that aliens were nonsense, but after seeing this and other sightings in the area, I no longer scoff at anyone who claims that they have seen a UFO ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness works in the medical field.  PD));31.135;-97.7759999999999
Weird lights;2007-08-22 22:00:00;45mins;Weird lights Me and my sister where walking down the street when we looked over and noticed it between the house and seen a light hoovering over all the other light so we stopped to watch it. After a few moments the object got bigger and brighter then kinda faded out. So we ran to get everyone when we came back it was gone, noone believed us then another one appeared just like the first one had, it starts out small and gets a lil bigger and brighter, it was in the same place as the first. They move very slowly and then it dropped a sec. one from it and they both hoover for a moment and burn out. We have looked up online and they look the same as some of the other reports in our area, we have called the mps on post they said they were not doing training. Its still unxplained;31.135;-97.7759999999999
Strange objects over Fort Hood Military Installment;2010-02-16 22:30:00;45 Mintues;Strange objects over Fort Hood Military Installment We were driving home from a Basketball Game and I was the first to notice the odd shapes in the sky. It first looked like Orion's Belt but noticed that there was a red sphere shaped objeillct that was pulsating. Asked my mom to look and she saw it too.  Told my dad and since he stated I worked out there before, they are just testing.  I made the comment, How can you test something that is still? It's not moving nor is it being tested  This happened for about 45 Minutes but driving in that part of Texas is like driving in Colorado.  So the duration could have been shorter, not really sure, but all I know is that,  There was something out there that was NOT Military;31.135;-97.7759999999999
