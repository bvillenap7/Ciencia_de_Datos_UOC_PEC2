First observed 3 objects along the side of a cliff. They slowly moved out over the lake, were joined by 2 more from behind hill. Rose and moved rapidly over hill out of lake valley. As we drove out of the valley driving to town, observed objects moving toward town. More objects were observed rising from trees a few hundred yards away, one split into two, all moved away to the northwest at an extreme rate of accelleration and disappeared. As we drove we observed more objects. The other observer was career army, said he had never seen anything like the objects (had been stationed at Ft. Hood). A Major at the base could offer no explanation the next day. Objects rose, hovered, made right angle turns, and made no sound. The area around the lake was being used for military maneuvers, as it was for the six months I worked there, and nothing of this type was observed at any other time. Closest observation of these objects was about 200 yds. Estimated size at 18 dia. Helicopters were in the area, but seemed to not notice them.;31.135;-97.7759999999999
