Unidentified egg shaped phenomenon moving slow among visible birds passing it up!;2013-09-01 15:00:00;12 seconds;Unidentified egg shaped phenomenon moving slow among visible birds passing it up! 2013 around September, recorded using my Logitech C615.  The camera is fixed onto the end of an apparatus which extends outside my window upstairs.  The USB wire is fed into my PC where I view the monitor inside my house.  My monitor was turned off.  So, when I turned the monitor on, right there smack dab in the center of the monitor is this hovering Unidentified phenomena.   I stared for a few seconds in major disbelief as it wobbles slowly heading outside the cameras range of view.  Since this object was moving so slow, I had the grand opportunity to press record AND also to look out my open window to the direction and exact location of this hovering object.  My bare eyes could not locate this object, I was able to see only the birds which fly by CLEARLY on the video.  The object was only visible to my camera, I know this for a fact because of my opportunity to see outside with my own eyes.   As I tried to follow the slow moving object, my pull string technology camera controls busted as I pulled too hard I guess.  I was still able to view more of this somewhat bulky pulsating object.,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa_1qtHu6Jo ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
