My brother and I were looking at the western sky on a warm, night in late July, 1983.  We saw an object that at first looked like a plane.  But, the lights on this object were NOT blinking on and off.  Instead, they were pulsating in different colors of green, red, and yellow.  There were three or four solid round color patterns of green, red, and yellow that seemed to pulsate as they traveled around the craft in a circle while it flew from south to north.  It would move very slowly before speeding up and slowing again performing maneuvers unlike any aircraft I've ever seen.  We (my brother and I)  got into the car to go get completely away from the city lights, and we were able to keep track of it from the car, but lost sight of it about ten or fifteen minutes from the initial sighting. It was as close as an airplane, but made no sound. It definitely did not move like any known earthlike aircraft I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I saw what looked like a green laser shoot through the sky directly above me, making absolutely no sound.;2003-08-20 20:35:00;4 seconds;I saw what looked like a green laser shoot through the sky directly above me, making absolutely no sound. I was taking my only cigarette break outside of my job, when I was staring out into the parking lot. Something caught my eye directly above me, when I saw what looked like a green laser flying through the air. It was going relatively fast in an Eastern direction. I followed it with my eyes when it just disappeared like vapor. It didn't seem to be too far in the sky and it made absolutely no noise at all. The conditions outside were warm and muggy with partly cloudy skies.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

Cigar shaped object over the San Antonio International Airport Thursday June 4th 2009 10:12 am CDT;2009-06-04 10:12:00;1 minnute;Cigar shaped object over the San Antonio International Airport Thursday June 4th 2009 10:12 am CDT The morning of June the 4th Thursday 2009 at approximately 10:12 am CDT. I was traveling south bound on Jones Malts burger Rd at the intersection of Nakoma near the Blossom Athletic Complex, when I noticed a strange object which I thought was a plane as it was directly over the San Antonio INTL Airport.  It was a cigar shaped craft about the size of a Cessna or leer jet.  It was following the same trajectory that a normal plane would make on approach to landing, however it was not descending.  The object traveled from my left (the west) to my right (the east).  It was a very slow moving object and I watched it for about 1 minute.  The object then turned 90 degrees away from me and traveled south.  When it turned it was like I was looking at the back end of it so it was now circular in shape and had no wings.  The object then seemed to vanish.  It did not speed off, it just kind of de-materialized.  It was almost as if it had gone behind a cloud however the sky was extremely clear and there was no haze present at all.  When I got to a high interchange I looked at downtown San Antonio just to see if there was any sort of haze and there was none.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

UFO flies into dark cloud and disappears.;2015-06-24 14:00:00;3 minutess;UFO flies into dark cloud and disappears. I was on my way to an afternoon appointment, and I stopped at my subdivision's entrance, which intersects a very busy street in the Stone Oak area.  It was a typical South Texas day, hot as hell, and clear blue, but for a couple dark clouds.  We're in big sky country and I just glanced up as a I waited for a break in traffic to merge and I saw plane flying from east to west. No, not a plane.  That's not a plane.  I'm used to seeing aircraft in San Antonio, with all the army bases.  I know what most large military craft look like and they also fly very low.  But this was different.  This was cigar shaped kind of like a sleek Zeppelin, silver, no lights, no visible insignia. I'm watching traffic I think.  There's no one behind me so I lose many opportunities to merge so I can continue to identify the flying object I've become so drawn to.  I wonder if anyone else can see it. It's not a plane.  It's not a military plane or drone.  It's flying low enough to see it's not a plane.  It's just cruising and I'm watching it and it flies right into the only dark cloud in the very bright blue sky and never comes out the other end. Not possible. I don't pull over.  I don't want to know.  No one is behind me still and I merge into traffic and begin to drive but keep my eyes on the cloud.  The cloud remains and the object never comes out the other end. I stop at a near light and the object still doesn't come out. I'm stopped next to McDonalds.  The object still doesn't come out. That's not a plane. It's not normal but I need to keep moving.  I know I do.  I keep my appointments, I tell my immediate family and it's just another unexplained sighting that they think is really cool but dismiss after dinner. When I was younger, I didn't know any better and would report these sightings to police.  Now I know to report some to UFO centers and keep moving.  I am surprised by this one though, that it didn't make the news, that no one saw it.  It was so huge in such a bright sky, the middle of the day.  I don't think anyone saw it.  I saw the world go on like normal. I don't think they all saw it.  I don't know how they couldn't have.  It flew into that dark cloud and that was it, its tomb, it never came out.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
