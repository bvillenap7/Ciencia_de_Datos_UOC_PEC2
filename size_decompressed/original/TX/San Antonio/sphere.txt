The only way to describe this object is as a water tower sitting on 3 large pipes that were standing vertically.each pipe was around 3 feet in diameter at a 45 degree angle leading to the large water tower looking like object. It must of stood at least 125 feet in the air. In the center of this object it had a thinner pipe coming down to the ground this pipe must of been a foot in diameter. This all took place in the back yard of my neighbors long story short me and the mother of my child go to the store 15 minutes later when we come back it was gone.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
