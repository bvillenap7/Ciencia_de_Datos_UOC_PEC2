Dark round object with long trail of sparks following  it seemed to slowly float  just above our home.;1973-09-12 23:00:00;5 minutes;Dark round object with long trail of sparks following  it seemed to slowly float  just above our home. Round dark object traveling slowly from north-northwest to south-southeast. Sparks and what looked like debri were falling from object leaving a long trail to the sides and behind object.  The object, when right above us, was about half the size of our lot which is 50 feet wide.  Although it looked as though it was not very high up, we could not tell how high it was.  As it passed beyond our house towards the city (7 miles away), it looked as though it would crash downtown.  Later we heard on the radio that it had crashed on the Chapman Ranch about 150 miles or so from San Antonio.  The next morning the news reported that it was thought to be a piece of a Russian satellite and that a scientific team from Trinity University (San Antonio, Tx) was being sent to investigate. We made several calls to authorities and the airport but no one had seen anything.  What was so strange is that no one that we asked had seen anything either. There was never anything else mentioned in the news about it. It was such a large object that it would be impossible to miss seeing it. We thought even if it was just a Russian satellite, it should have been a huge news story.  My husband and I were professionals working in the computer industry when this occurred.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

It was in the morning and this grey ball was floating in the sky.;1994-11-10 07:13:00;about 30 sec.;It was in the morning and this grey ball was floating in the sky. I was waiting at the bus stop, and happened to look up in the sky and saw this grey ball floating.  It was above the trees, not really high up, maybe like a high kite can go.  It was perfectly round and was solid light grey exept for a thick band, almost like a belt, that went around it horizontally.  This band looked like it was made out of metal, and it had round green and red lights on it.  The craft slowly moved across the sky, and I lost it behind the apartment buildings. This whole thing lasted about 30 seconds, and was also seen by the other person at the bus stop.  He didn't know what it was either.  I know the date and time because I had researched this topic before and so documented it on my clipboard.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Confirmed Blue Egg Lights San Antonio March 2000.;2000-03-12 04:00:00;5 minutes;Confirmed Blue Egg Lights San Antonio March 2000. I have been searching for information regarding an event that occurred to me around this same time period in the same city, and I found a report that describes almost the same thing on your site as a Blue Energy Egg (Occurred : 3/17/2000 04:00 (Entered as : 3/17/00 4:00am) Reported:  10/23/2000 23:31 Posted:  2/25/2003  Location:  San Antonio, TX  Shape:  Triangle  Duration:  2 minutes).  It was around this same time period that I was living in Twin Lakes Mobile Home Park, and I remember waking up and seeing the bedroom of the mobile home filled with a blue light that seemed to be coming from the SW(?)side of the mobile home.  With the blinds drawn it appeared in the bedroom window that a bright blue light circular in shape was being cast onto the window but illuminated the entire inside of the mobile home.  So it had a point of origin but appeared to be equally brilliant in the room...if that makes sense.  At the time, I was a Police Officer at Ft. Sam Houston, I had no idea why this woke me, there was no noise and my ex-wife did not wake up, I immediately got up and secured my pistol as my first thought was pranksters or somebody trying to do ill to me or my family. as soon as I secured my weapon I began to attempt to look through the blinds to see where the light was coming from and as I did this POOF...the light was gone.  I checked the other windows before heading outside, armed, to investigate.  When I went out on the rear deck, I heard and saw nothing.  No animal noises, like dogs barking, etc. that would indicate anything was wrong.  Very still and quiet.  I chalked it up to craziness and went back to bed.  Odd thing is, last few days I have had dreams about this incident that spurred me to look, and I found this here.  WOW....

bright light,possible spinning,moving west;2002-07-09 21:30:00;1 hour;bright light,possible spinning,moving west About 9:30 p.m.,I went outside at a friends house to have a ciggarette. I looked west of my location and saw a very bright light that looked as though it was either changing shape or mabey spinning. there were light clouds in the area and the object seemed to go throught the clouds as if it were just sitting there. I went inside to look in the phonebook to see were i could report what i saw, but could not find anything. I went back outside about 25 minutes after and the object had moved west and got dimmer.It seemed to travel in a west direction very slowly. On my way home traveling north on the highway, it seemed to be clearer to see as i got home. someone mentioned it might be the space station or shuttle, but i dont think so. there were no blinking lights or flashing lights of any kind just a white light that seemed to either change shape or spin. I thought it was very unusual.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Two circle crafts performing gravity defining manuvers.;2004-02-15 03:00:00;4 minutes;Two circle crafts performing gravity defining manuvers. I was star gazzing with my girlfriend and her sister using a telescope. In the SW portion of the sky I saw two slightly glowing silver objects in the sky. They where moving up, down, left and right directions in the sky, they began to hover closer and closer to us until they where about 500 to 1000 feet away. Then I heard a real low humming sound and after hearing it for about thirty seconds the two crafts rocketed straight up into the sky out of sight to the naked eye. The crafts where circle shape and when they where close it seemed the outer portion of the crafts where spinning with the center staying in place. I never seen anything like it in my life. Also to note when I saw them near I was going to use my Cell phone to report the crafts but my cell phone all of a sudden had no power or signal.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Sunset , multiple objects, mostly round, some triangular, 5 - 10 minute display;2004-10-17 19:00:00;5 - 10 minutes;Sunset , multiple objects, mostly round, some triangular, 5 - 10 minute display Around 7:00 - 7:20 pm, Sunday, October 17, 2004, the following happened: - My wife and I were walking our two dogs around sunset, trying to get finished before it got too dark to safely walk the dogs. We were returning to our house in Alamo Heights, walking past the high school. - I commented on the beautiful sunset to our left, and we stopped our walk and both admired it. It was quite pretty, one of those really good, bright Texas sunsets. - My wife then pointed out a distinct ball that had appeared in the sunset clouds... - It was absolutely distinct, with a greyish edge outline... I looked (skeptically) to where ((wife's name deleted)) was indicating and saw the object very clearly. It was an Aw Sh-t... moment. - The object appeared like a distant but clearly round planet would appear out in space, distinctly round, very likely a globe, but with no surface features. It appeared to have a smooth surface. - Things began to get pretty weird, pretty fast. We saw more and more  distinct balls appearing throughout the cloud banks. then after there were several large globes / balls in view, some of them suddenly began having 3 - 4 smaller balls appear right next to them... I believe that all of these new spheres appeared to the objects' left, our right. Some of these new smaller globes / spheres then would move off...  I simply could not comprehend what I / we were seeing. - We estimated that in total there were at least a dozen large objects and many more smaller objects. - They were primarily in two sizes and round shapes, but there were some triangular ones as well. The triangular shapes had rounded corners. - The objects were as distinct and solid-appearing as marbles. - These were very distinct balls or globes, with definite firm outlines and consistent appearances. Some when they appeared were triangular, but they remained that way, and the round ones stayed round. They all remained quite distinct and clear through this episode. - Early on I saw one that was so distinct and bright that I mentioned to ((name deleted)) that it looked like a plane with its landing lights on... Monica told me she had not mentioned it because she was sure it was a plane. Although the light was red, I thought this airplane might somehow help explain what we were seeing. We both viewed this specific object for a while, and it wasn't an airplane. It moved to the right for a bit, then stopped and hung there.  It hung in the sky throughout the episode. - We spent the next 5 minutes or so excitingly pointing to other globe / ball or triangular objects that simply appeared, or others that were moving left or right relative to all the other balls. - This type of activity was going on throughout our field of vision and beyond so that we had to scan a bit of the sky to take in all the objects. I estimate around a 20 - 30 degree field of view was necessary to encompass all of this. We of course were primarily going from one specific focus to another, but I would occasionally widen my view to take in more of the big picture. - As time passed, to the left side of the scenario, we watched some smaller balls that had come out of a larger ball morph into what looked like small, fiery-red, still distinct objects against a very dark background. All of this developed quite quickly. The objects continued to morph into more and more complex shapes and more detail against the dark background. It appeared to me that they morph'd into some sort ofcuneiform, or hieroglyphics. The images were quite distinct and clear, if very small, but what they were specifically I could not tell. - ((name deleted)) later described this same activity as looking like moving braille-like characters. - This particular display then morph'd into what looked exactly like a medium-sized city at night (black background, white glowing city lights) as seen from onboard an approaching aircraft. This scene first appeared to be a view from directly above a city, but then the view angled down to look exactly like the view one would have as they were landing into a city at night. - I kept telling ((name deleted)) that I wished I had brought our camera. Understatement of the century. - Then, very suddenly the whole show (writing characters, globes, other objects, etc.) began to quickly fade and merge back into (the effect appeared to us) the clouds behind them.  General Comments: - The entire incident was completely non-threatening with a calmness about it. - The whole effect was as though the visual show was generally unfolding toward us. It appeared that each new activity took place in front of, or at least came out of and to the side or below the previous objects. - We really did not have time to ask ourselves what they were because we were simply too busy pointing out one or another new item or activity to each other. - It seems certain that ((name deleted)) and I saw the same exact images because we repeatedly pointed out one or another object to each other, and we would then get immediate confirmation. It was unbelievable, except that ((name deleted)) and I clearly saw this. - There was a family in a house behind us with a motorcycle in their driveway behind a dark red Hummer. I have not yet contacted them to see if they saw anything like we did. - I called my mother to see if she had seen anything in the sunset, but she had not watched it tonight. - I called my friend to see if he or his wife had viewed the sunset, but they had not. I  spoke to my friend at length about this. - I called WOAI TV news hotline to see if any one else had seen and reported anything, they had not received any news like this, and neither had their weatherman.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Witnessed a circular bright light in the san antonio sky that dropped vertically rapidly and disappeared;2005-07-13 22:42:00;2 seconds;witnessed a circular bright light in the san antonio sky that dropped vertically rapidly and disappeared sitting on the balcony, facing northwest, smoking a cigarette, talking to my wife about having a sighting of a ufo here in san antonio, since its near mexico, and there have been many sightings in mexico.  moments later i glanced up at the night sky and briefly saw a bright yellowish circular light drop from the top of the sky toward the horizon at a vertical angle. the light dropped a far distance rapidly and disappeared suddenly.  my wife thinks it was some asteroid or meteriorite, but i've seen falling stars many times when i was a child, and the distance was not from outerspace, but much closer, looked as if it were within the atmosphere. was it a ufo, or was it some technology from one of the air force or military bases nearby? i am a biology student, and am a believer in unknown, sentient life in outer space.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
3 white lights moving East with a helicopter watching them at a distance;2005-10-24 05:30:00;8 minutes;3 white lights moving East with a helicopter watching them at a distance Heading into San Antonio about 15 miles on the outskirts of town approaching Randolph AFB and Shertz area on HWY 78 we noticed 3 circular white lights and a 4th which was what looked to be a helicopter following the lights.  The lights were moving West to East and spread out in a perfect line not moving all that fast.  The lights were round white like a headlight but they did not have the red flashing or blue/green lights that normal aircraft have.  They were just solid.  They moved about 10 miles to the East with the copter following them.  Then they all stopped moving and then a few seconds later the 3 lights disappeared.  The copter was still hovering like it was watching them, probably sent up by the Air Forrce base.  Then they came back on again and kept heading East but I had to go to work and they were further away from us.  I had my Fiance with me at the time and she saw them as well. It wasn't normal aircraft as I was raised a military bratt.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

Hovering, silver disk viewed from Park Mountain towards downtown San Antonio, TX.;2011-04-07 02:00:00;3.5 hours;Hovering, silver disk viewed from Park Mountain towards downtown San Antonio, TX. This report is for an individual that does not use a PC.   Mr. ((name deleted)) works and lives on my property in the Park Mountain subdivision in North West San Antonio.  The subdivision is in the beginning of the Texas Hill Country and one hill beyond the view of downtown San Antonio.  This location is just below the intersection of air traffic heading to the San Antonio International Airport in an approximately east direction and the Lackland Air Force Base traffic heading approximately south.   Mr. ((name deleted)) had gone outside his room that morning at 2:00 because he heard dogs barking.   As he looked around, he saw a silver disk hovering and making no noise but flashing red linear lights up in the shape of a V and a single red light flashing straight down.    Since my home is on a sloped lot, he moved up hill to get a better view.  The craft was more clearly visible and it appeared to be a silver color with a yellow light around the circumference.  ((name deleted)) reported t! his information to me the day after the sighting.   He had tried to call me on my cell phone several times beginning at 2a.m. but I had left it in my car.   The circular craft was approximately 50 feet in diameter and was approximately 200 yards away.  It was situated in a position to look over the horizon towards downtown San Antonio and towards Lackland AFB.   ((name deleted)) tried to snap photos with his cell phone but due to the distance and night sky, he could not capture the craft.   The craft hovered for approximately 3.5 hours and disappeared just before sunrise.  It has not been seen since but I have advised ((name deleted)) to definitely contact me regardless of the time if a similar situation occurs again.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

White lights around a large circular object moving down from the dark sky behind some trees;2011-12-09 21:00:00;about a minute;White lights around a large circular object moving down from the dark sky behind some trees I was over at my neighbor’s chatting with her & her brother on the front porch. It was a cloudy that night. I was facing toward the south & I happen to catch a row of six circular white lights moving slowly downwards. The object was about a block away. I pointed at the object to show my neighbors & to make sure I wasn’t the only one seeing it.Their mouths dropped when they saw it. The object was moving downwards in a diagonal direction to the right & was moving around in a circular motion while doing this. It was a relatively large object, I wouldn’t say larger than the moon though, maybe half the size of the moon if you were looking at the two side by side in the sky.  It was moving really slow at first so I ran off the porch & snapped a couple of pictures of it on my iPhone.  It looked like it was pretty close to the surface, definitely not the height a plane would be traveling at. It started to pick up speed & soon it vanished behind the trees.  I tried running around the corner to see if I could look through the trees, but didn’t catch any suspicious lights.  The neighborhood dogs started barking & I heard a strange ringing in my left ear.  After that I got freaked out & ran back to my neighbor’s porch.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

But I heard no noise or felt any wind. so I turn to my rt, where the light was coming from & up in the air, next to my neighbor's front yard tree was this bright bluish-white light, coming downward on me, from a BIG round shape object, that at first glance looked like the moon. it did not move, just stood still. I then took 3 steps toward it. Then as I was looking at it, it just disappeared in a blink of an eye. So I went inside & went to the front yard & my neighbor's, but saw nothing.

We all thought the light appeared to be flickering but it was bright.  It moved in a straight line following the same path as the previous light but there was no sound.
