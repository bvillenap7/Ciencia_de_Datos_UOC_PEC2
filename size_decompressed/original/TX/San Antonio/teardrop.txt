After focusing the object I see the shape is a teardrop yellow bright light in the center and the outer edges seem to emit red and green lights slightly changing the shape to little cylinders coming off the lower part of the teardrop.  I stared at it for some time trying to figure what the heck it was - it seem almost gaseous looking the greens and reds seemed to be changing the outer layer. Very odd.  So I went inside and called a friend then after a while went back outside again and the object had moved several houses down the street in distance...  Now on the other side of the street at rooftop level again in the distance was another light that emitted red, blue green and yellow at a rapid pace but much smaller size and circular but very colorful like a xmas tree.  Wow two ufo sightings in one night and its only March!  I see lots of different odd things in the sky and I see planes a lot too but these two objects did not make any noise.  I don't believe satellites look like this nor do they hover so low in the sky.  The constellations were way up in the atmosphere so I know they were not stars.
