Large rectangular object with muticolored lights like needled in  a pin cushion;2002-01-11 21:40:00;36 seconds;Large rectangular object with muticolored lights like needled in  a pin cushion UFO SEEN NEAR DOWNTOWN SAN ANTONIO  It was after 8:15 in the evening.  I was getting into van to pick-up daughter from dance classes.  I just entered vehicle and was getting ready to start van and observed a bright flash hit the window.  I thought, I had blow car battery or some electrical problem.  I leaned forward and saw an object threw van window. I observed object for a few seconds and exited van.  The object was dark or black and had a rectangular shape. I estimated from a lamppost nearby that the object was about 80 ft above me. It was sort of a large trunk like shape.  It had multicolored lights that were at the ends of what look like rods that projected out from the structure of ship, like needles in a pincushion.  It was about three medium- car lengths long and about two car lengths wide.  It did not emit any sound.  I walked to a parking lot next to my driveway and that object was motionless for about 5 seconds.  The object begin to move in a southeast direction slowly and then made a turn to the northeast and began to rise.  I moved to follow it and went to corner of street and major intersection.  I looked up and down street to see if anyone else was able to see object.  I did not see any persons or vehicles in the area it was very quiet. It then began to move and suddenly seemed to stretch out and then disap! peared from my view into what was northeast direction,  After incident, I went back to my van and attempted to start engine but it would not start and the following day or days I removed battery and took it to nearby car radio and video shop.  The shop guy stated that battery was blow and he noted that battery cables were fused when he returned with new battery to replace blown battery. This craft was beautiful and seemed to just float and move with little effort.  The effect of it stretching out was like observing in going into a tunnel and then it was gone.

White object with glowing green around it moving at rapid pace from east to west.;2004-07-05 03:15:00;3 sec;White object with glowing green around it moving at rapid pace from east to west. My girlfriend and I took a trip to San Antonio.  We stayed at the St Anthony Hotel downtown.  This hotel has a roof top patio with a good view of the sky.  Although we had a lot of sky to look at, there were not many stars out because we were in the downtown area.  We were hanging out at around 3:15 am having a cigarette.  Both of us were sitting facing the south discussing the previous evening.   Looking southward at a 65 degree angle we both saw a fast moving light.  It lasted about 3 seconds and moved quickly from east to west.  The light was the size of my pinky fingernail at arms length with a white/green tint(white center and green glow around it.)  The light object disappeared.  It did not burn up or leave a trail like a shooting star.  It just disappeared.  I am an avid star gazer and this was not a shooting star.  Nor was it an iridium satellite because it moved so quickly and was not just a brief flash.  I have seen many things in our skies, but this was most unique.

Two black rectangular objects rotating in a consistent straight line heading West.;2012-08-13 15:00:00;15 minutes;Two black rectangular objects rotating in a consistent straight line heading West. Put sunglasses on and walked outside, looked up and noticed a chemtrail style halo among the clouds. As I stared for a few seconds, in the path of my focus was a black rectangle which was moving straight West. The object maintained a steady rotation. It never changed direction or speed as I could not take my eyes off of it.  I have 20/20 vision and I eyeballed that object until it was so far West, it was no longer visible. As I composed myself to keep it together, I looked up at the sky again and WOW! Another exact duplicate black rotating rectangular object following the direct path and speed consistency as the first. As high up as the two objects were, I would estimate about a mile high, they were approximately 15-20 feet in length and thin. Solid black and awesome.  I have only been fascinated by my lucid dreams of flying or having fun in the dreamworld prior to the two objects I witnessed. I am amazed at the thin blue lines before sleep that evolve into symmetric patterns only to be introduced to a diamond grid which is made apparent by the unseen force behind it. A presence or Some &quotthing&quot is swooshing cursive-like gleaming, sparkling, glowing, shimmering communication. Hard to believe is not my concern, I simply do not understand exactly.  I also have had a black triangle become apparent in my presleep light show. I am used to the star cluster normal activity when the eyelids are closed. But just a few days ago, I was messing around with concentration and the ultra violet or purple clusters opened up in the center and formed a black triangle. THEN, a star or spark appeared in the exact center. Wow, then I see those two black rectangles in the sky?? I have NEVER messed with acid or mushrooms. Been weird forever it seems.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Strange Light Over San Antonio (Fresno St/Edison HS Area);2018-11-02 10:00:00;5 seconds;Strange Light Over San Antonio (Fresno St/Edison HS Area) I was picking up my friend from her house around 10 o’clock.  She was trying to sneak out of her house, so my other friend and I waited in the car for her.  We didn’t want people to notice us so we turned off the headlights completely and lowered the inside lights coming from the console down (thus there was no chance it was a glare).   We were waiting and then in an instant, both of us see this yellow-greenish light.  It was rectangular.  The street itself was completely dark with the exception of a light post off in the distance.  It just appeared out of nowhere.  It glided downwards for 5 seconds and then it just ended.  It didn’t touch the ground, all of this happened mid-air.  It was so quick but very vivid.  We could tell it was a rectangle with a green-yellow light/aura coming from it.   It was that high but it wasn’t that low.  I would say it was at the height of when airplanes just take off, like when they haven’t reached their height cruising speed but not that low.  It was very odd.   The windows were down to and we didn’t hear anything coming from it.  It couldn’t have been a firework or flare as it didn’t come up, it just appeared and then went down.  It couldn’t have been a drone, we would have seen the lights continue and it wouldn’t have just appeared out of nowhere.  And it definitely wasn’t an airplane or a helicopter.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
