It was like a camera flash, but it was from above our heads, there was no planes or helicopters in the area and a very thin cloud cover.  About 1 minute after the flash we were looking up into the sky and saw a small light in the thin clouds that looked like something was above the clouds with a  light and the light was moving around slowly in a circle and then disapeared.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

I am a 40 year old truck driver from texas i have been driving for 6 years i normally drive at night so i see falling stars and satelites cross the night sky on a daily basis but this night i  was standing outside my home in the front yard facing south it was a clear night i often look up at the night sky and see satelites cross the night sky but this object had a bright flash of white light then it shrank to the size of a small star,then it continued on a southwest path for approxmately 10 seconds.My first guess is that it my have been a satelite or the shuttle i have seen the space station cross my night sky it has great speed,this object didn't if i hadn't seen the flash before i would just think i was watching a satelite cross the night sky.Well if anyone can help with suggestions on what this object may have been i would appreciate it greatly.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
