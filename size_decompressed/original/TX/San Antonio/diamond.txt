Huge UFO over North Star Mall;1989-11-15 18:00:00;10 seconds;Huge UFO over North Star Mall Just before Thanksgiving 1989, my wife was on our rooftop, adjusting the TV antenna for better reception. This was at dusk. I was inside informing her when reception was clear. She came down off the roof, walked in the back door and told me she just saw a huge UFO. She described the incident to me and to be honest, I dismissed her story as a mis-identification of a known aircraft. I've always regretted that. Her depiction of the event is as follows: While adjusting the antenna, she looked up and saw a huge kite (diamond?) shaped aircraft, hovering silently, just a few blocks north of our house, near North Star Mall. She said it was about the size of two football fields, the structure appeared black in color and the bottom had numerous white colored lights. It hovered for a few seconds about 600 ft. off the gound then very quickly, shot off to the west and out of site. From her description, the object was very, very large and I couldn't understand why we never heard any reports about the event. She can recount this even, in detail, anytime. Let me add that a couple of years later, while driving in San Antonio one evening, we both saw a mysterious craft, traveling slowly, a low altitude, near the intersection of I10 and Loop 410. My wife said, there it is! Just like the other one I saw. My reaction again, was sort of like well, whatever! I think what we saw was just so bizzare, we had trouble accepting it. Now, years later, I do accept it and would like to know if others witnessed these events, the same time we did.  Note: I filed another report a few minutes ago of an incident that I experienced in Alpine, TX. In error, I listed another witnesses name(Russ Davis), rather than mine. Sorry, I didn't think of myself as the witness. I'm slow, huh? ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Bright white diamond shaped light;2012-10-09 20:15:00;2-4 minutes;I was randomly staring into the sky, when all of a sudden a bright white diamond shaped light appeared out of nowhere.  It moved east to west, west to east, then slowly started to ascend upward towards the north.  As it was ascending, it disappeared, like a light turning off. The time was around 815 pm, sky was clear and I could see stars in the sky.  I live on the southside of town, off of Military Dr and Zarzamora.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

We see a diamond shape craft with 4 white lights at the four corners and a dim red light in the center.;2016-06-16 22:26:00;5 seconds;As I drove up to my house, my daughter then states look up and points to the sky.  As we both look up to the end of our street, we see a diamond shape craft with 4 white lights at the four corners and a dim red light in the center.   It hovered for 5 seconds and immediately moved from left to the right and disappeared.  I then called my mother in law from the inside of the house and we all went to the front yard, where then it appeared again, and moved left to right rapidly and disappeared.  We were in awe and came into the house where we saw through our 5 by10 entrance window in our two story house, giving us the ability to see the sky while standing in our entrance.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
