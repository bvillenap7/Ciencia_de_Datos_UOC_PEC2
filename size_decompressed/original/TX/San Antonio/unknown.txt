A humming noise  and then a bright light in the sky which I saw at home at an appartment complex on northside east  SA tx  off  HW1976;1999-11-28 21:30:00;10-15 minutes;A humming noise  and then a bright light in the sky which I saw at home at an appartment complex on northside east  SA tx  off  HW1976 My self and my wife we saw a bright light on this November 28,  It was about 9:30 and there was a light outside.   My wife and I saw it and it was pretty dark out side there was no other persons outside of the apartment complex where we lived. the light was so bright when I looked out the blinds I could see a shadow on the living room wall.  The light was like no other I had seen. being former Navy I have seen many different aircraft and  lights they would use for illumination.  This light was very surreal and like a fire bright orange like when the sun sets and it lite up the entire complex and the back alley. there was nothing in the sky when I checked the out side. It was a dreary night and looked as if it would rain but it did not. the entire event took place I would say in about five to ten minutes.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Seven UFOs spotted on a beautifully clear south Texas night over San Antonio;2002-04-17 21:45:00;20 minutes;Seven UFOs spotted on a beautifully clear south Texas night over San Antonio Around 9:30 to 9:50 p.m. CST in the 90% clear south Texas skies over San Antonio I spotted a total of 7 -- yes, SEVEN! -- separate flying objects, five of which had steadily flashing lights. The objects were moving far too quickly to be airplanes. I saw the first object moving by itself very quickly toward my direction and then it veered off in a northerly direction. A few minutes later I spotted two more objects of exactly the same quality and size moving very quickly but always remaining the same distance apart. I called my roommate outside so I'd have at least one other witness. He and I both watched the two objects quite clearly for about 45 seconds. He went back inside when the objects disappeared behind one of the few clouds in an otherwise unusually clear night sky. The strange thing about these two objects was that they never re-appeared on the other side of the cloud as a satellite or airplane would have had to do (at their rate of speed, we figure it should have taken them no more than 10 or 15 seconds to re-appear). I later spoke with one of the local TV weathermen who had mentioned on his weathercast the next night that he had seen these same two flying objects. He told me that he and his son also had seen them disappear behind that single cloud and never emerge on the other side! These were the only two of the total seven objects I eventually saw that did not appear to emit flashing light. Finally, to my amazement, several minutes later I spotted FOUR MORE of the lights (craft?) traveling in a different part of the sky and going in a totally different direction from objects 1 and objects 2 and 3. These four flew from south to north and the four of them maintained strict relative position to each other but were not flying in a straight-line pattern. All four had regularly flashing lights. This is the first time in my life I've seen anything remotely like this. The objects made no sound, had no red lights as are typically found on airplanes, and they travelled at what must have been very high speeds, though they did not dart around, nor were there any gaps in their flight patterns. Most exciting thing I've witnessed in years. I'd love to know if anyone else saw them!;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Red and green beams of light coming from a central bright (headlight appearing) object moving erratically in night sky.;2003-03-12 22:40:00;unlimited;Red and green beams of light coming from a central bright (headlight appearing) object moving erratically in night sky. I was lying in bed looking out my sky window at the stars.  I noticed one in particular that had a bright white light like headlights with what appeared to be red and green beams coming out of it.  They looked like spotlights.  It was also a little cloudy that day but had cleared up.  The object moved erratically and hovered.  I could see what I thought were sparks coming out of it as it moved or jutted around.  It moved slowly like a helicopter but was too high in the sky to be a plane or helicopter.  My husband also saw it and thought it was a star until he could see the colors of red and green.  It did not twinkle like a star.  It moved very slow and all of a sudden would jutt left or right.  I had been home most of the evening and my husband had come home a little later from work.  I thought about getting my video camera but it was late and my daughter was asleep.  Did not want to wake her. ((NUFORC Note:  If the witness was looking to the south, she may have been looking at the star, Sirius, which is very bright, and quite colorful.  PD));29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Star moving extremily fast across the sky, not a sattelite or plane.;2007-07-26 22:00:00;30 min;Star moving extremily fast across the sky, not a sattelite or plane. My husband's friend called last night, telling us to go outside and look at the sky. He and his girlfriend were outside along with two of there neighbors, witnessing lights in the sky. They said they were all moving very fast and changing directions. My husband and I did not see what they were talking about but as we were about to go back inside, we did see something. It looked just like a star in the sky, so it was in outer space. It was moving upwards in a vertical direction in the sky. It was moving so fast! Within seconds it had moved from right above the horizon line to the other side of the sky. I don't think it was a satellite because I don't think they travel that fast. It definitely wasn't a plane or a jet because it was like a star, so I know that it was in space. Maybe it was the space station? I thought it would be brighter though. Anyways, that's what we saw, but our friend says he saw much more that night.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
((HOAX??))  abduction, but no success;2007-11-11 03:00:00;30 minutes;abduction, but no success   I had an experience where I was almost abducted, but no success.  I was laying in bed and I awoke to my body being totally paralyzed.  I felt hands on my back which were holding me down and keeping me paralyzed.  I heard litte girls giggling and laughing, telling me to sleep and to relax.  I fought this with all my might. I finally got up and turned around and discovered someone with a hooded robe in my room.  the hooded robe was purple and the being had a beard. I heard a loud dong noise and then it disappeared! I was so scared and frightened to tears. I don't know what's going on in san antonio's westside neighboorhoods, but it needs to stop. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax??

strange object of lights over san antonio, tx;2009-08-13 04:55:00;1 hour;strange object of lights over san antonio, tx i was sitting at the computer when my wife was looking outside and said she saw a light in the sky. we went to the window and when i saw it first, i thought it was a plane. it was giving off the blue, and red lights that planes give when flying at night. but this wasn't moving. we watched for about 5 minutes before we went outside to get a better look. the lights seemed to be moving left to right in a circular motion. we sat there and continued to watch it, but it never moved, it just sat there. we started to notice that it appeared as if it were slowly moving up and down, but that could just be because we were staring right at it. it was also bright, so it might have been a star, but there were stars scattered around tonight, but none were acting like this, this was definitly strange. yes sir, i typed in the wrong date. it was the 13th of August when i saw the object. since that morning i stayed up the next two days to see if i could see the same object and nothing in that general area ever showed up. i'm not exactly sure what it was, i figured it might have been a star, but don't they stay in about the same area. anyway, thankyou for the writing back and sorry once again for the mix up on dates.   THANK YOU,;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

Flashing blue lights on craft, flashed 2 different patterns and was not indicative of  any aircraft in our area.;2013-01-15 20:15:00;~10 minutes;Flashing blue lights on craft, flashed 2 different patterns and was not indicative of  any aircraft in our area. Strange type of flashing blue lights on a craft that hovered over area west of downtown San Antonio.  Thought it was a helicopter until I realized that they do not have blue lights.  Light configuration was not indicative of any other aircraft we have in the area (and we are the HQ of USAF and location of Boeing repair so we have many types of aircraft in our area).  Lights appeared to have two different (or differently timed) flashing patterns and these lights were strobing so brightly that they obscured the vision of the craft.  I viewed this for at least 10-15 minutes as I was driving home from a meeting going through downtown San Antonio (from north SA to south SA).  It may have been traveling southwest to northeast, very slowly.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
