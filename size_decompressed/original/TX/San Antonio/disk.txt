As I was walking towards the apartment I looked up and saw this round saucer just above the roof across from my apartment.  As I was looking I saw white lights around the craft and blue flashing lights with red in the middle.  I was scared because I couldn't believe was I was seeing.  I must have stood there about two minutes trying to decide what to do.  I ran upstair to open my door and get a camera just inside and when I came back it was gone.  I did a sketch of what I saw and lost it, but I still remember it and the more I thought about it the more I believe what I saw was very real.  I checked around the next day to see if anyone else reported it but it seems I was the only one who saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I looked over to my right shoulder and there was a light on the ground. The pattern was about 10 feet wide. But there was not a shaft of light coming to the light on the ground. I look up and about 150 away from me in the tree line was a UFO just hovering above the tree tops. No sound emitting from it at all.Â  I told my brother in law and you believe that. We both looked at each other and kept fishing. We both are very well educated and have white collar jobs. We did not say anything to anyone in fear of losing our careers that we want to keep. So we made a pack not to tell anyone about this sighting. Until now we have not repeating to anyone what we saw. I just wanted someone to know what I saw. It was about 400 feet long and not a light on it. I could only see it by the light of the moon being behind it. I was there for about ten minutes and it took off. The craft went staight up and out of sight. Just wanted to tell my story to someone that might understand what we saw that night.

Saw a very large, silvery gray craft near the medical center area;1993-04-13 18:30:00;5 to 10 minutes;Saw a very large, silvery gray craft near the medical center area I approximated the date, but I know it was in April on a Friday.  I remember because it was the first day of the St. Mary's University Oyster bake, which kicks off Fiesta Week in San Antonio. My (ex)girlfriend and I had been near my parent's office.  She was with me while I was surveilling a claimant at an apartment complex off of Loop 410.  At the time, I was working as an investigator for the family business.  I worked on insurance cases:  worker's comp and auto liability. We had left the complex and were at my parent's office, which was nearby:  ((address deleted)) Executive Center.  We'd planned for me to pickup a van there.  I'd drive it over to my parents' house and name deleted))(my girlfriend) would follow in my car.  While in the parking lot, we noticed a weird looking object in the sky west of us, in the direction of my parents' place.  The object was silver-gray and metallic.  It was shaped like a conical disc seen in profile.  It seemed very big. We got into the vehicles after wondering about it briefly.  Since we were going in the same direction as the house (the house is about 1.5 miles from the office, as the crow flies, but about 2 miles away after all the twists in the road.) I decided to keep my eye on the thing.  So did ((name deleted)), as it turned out.  All the way home, the thing didn't seem to move.  That is, it seemed stationary.  And as we got closer to the house, we could see more of it, as if we were getting closer and closer to being under it.  The thing looked to be as high in the air as it was far away from the office.  At arms length, I'd say it would be about the size of a silver dollar, maybe bigger. By the time we got to the house, we were underneath it.  Diane had parked behind me.  I got out of the car to look up at the thing.  I could see the underside, and there were structures there, but the underside seemed hazy.  Blurred.  And I had the odd feeling that I was forgetting what the underside looked like even while I was looking directly at it.  Weird. Now, the whole time I was driving home, I kept telling myself to stop, go to my car (which Diane was following me in) and grab my damn camera.  It's crazy, but for some reason I almost couldn't.  Very strange.  So, when we arrived at the house, I parked and ran back to my car.  Diane was staring up through the windshield at it.  I tried to get her attention, then looked back up and the thing was gone!  I was a little pissed!  Diane was still staring, at nothing now.  When I snapped her out of it, she said that after we parked the thing flashed a light at her and was gone. I never heard any more about it.  The house is at an intersection on a major boulevard (Wurzbach) and is very near the medical center. There were lots of other cars around, tooling along Wurzbach.  I expected to hear that someone else had seen the thing, but I never heard anything about it. Oh, when I mention haze or aura below, it only applies to the underside of the thing, which was otherwise clear and sharp. In my opinion, the thing was somewhat elegant in design.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Unexplained circles in 1 acre yard;2004-06-10 18:00:00;1;Unexplained circles in 1 acre yard Hope you still use this email address.. After it rained about 8 inches 2 days ago at my father's house in China Grove, a suburb of San Antonio, TX, 2 circles (one inside the other) appeared behind our swimming pool.  Our yard is about 1/2 acre.  The circles are dead bermuda grass with live bermuda grass in the rest of the yard.  A few dirt patches happen to cross the lines of dead grass, and there are no tread marks.  There are no tire marks leading into the circle either.  I found a few long strands of the grass, and the part near the root is green.  The part at the very end is also green.  The middle of the strand that crossed the dead zone is brown. I took a lab-quality ferrous/non-ferrous metal detector to the entire portion of the yard and found nothing unusual in or out of the circle (my first thought was maybe a really old septic tank started seeping through cracks due to the extensive rain). There are no tread marks at all.  This happened immediately after a big rain, so the dirt spots would easily accept tire tracks. There are no bent or broken strands of grass, and nothing else seems unusual except for the dead spots.  The geometry is too perfect to be natural.  I know there are lawn diseases that cause brown circles, but the lines are too thin, too much diameter, and too perfect.  There is too much live grass between the circles. On the outer circle, there are two equally geometric dashes as thick as the circle's line, pointing outward. I have lots of pictures I will send if you like.  I still want to make sure this email account works before I take the time to zip and attach them.  I have pictures up close, far away, with/without flash, 12-inch ruler in scene, and the strands of crab/bermuda grass that crossed the dead line. The lines that make both circles are 5.4 inches wide.  The large circle's edge is about 27 inches outside of the small circle.  The outer circle is about 8.5 feet in diameter.  The inner circle has a 5 foot 4 inch diameter. This is driving my curiosity level crazy.  Please tell me if you have heard of anything like this before.

It was grayish-black and we still had the car running and all I could think of to get the camera inside the house.We were surprise and stunned. So we left to get the camera but if was gone.

The video was taken with a surveillance camera.  My husband and I were outside at the time and we did not hear any plane or helicopter in the sky.  No clouds were present in the sky at the time the video of the strange object was taken.  The two objects dissappear and move north abruptly in the sky.  They have no tail like a comet or shooting star, but do have sparks that are only present went it moves in the horizontal position.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

A friend of mine took this picture about 5 p.m. about 6 weeks ago.  He took the photo because he was looking at a plane that he thought that was not leaving chemtrails but contrails (a rarity in the last many years). He took the photo and then look up and notice a bright star and took another photo about 10-20 seconds later of the star. While looking at the photo at a later date a nephew noticed, after blowing up the photo, a UFO to the left of the star and airplane trail.  Then they blew up the other photo and saw the same UFO but at about a ninety degree angle difference than the first photo.

Camera: I am using a Canon 30D with an 18-55 mm Canon lens. I am using a tripod that I have balanced on a window ledge facing the southeast (through glass).  When I first set up I noticed the florescent lighting in the room was bouncing off the glass and right into my lens.  The hotel had adjustable curtain/shades that are normally used to hide the morning sunlight.  Ipulled that same curtain/shade over my head and blocked out all of the fluorescent lighting and glare from the room.

I was at the corner of Callaghan and Evers heading towards Bandera road, when the object caught my eye.  It was heading south towards Lackland A.F.B, at what appeared to be a slow rate of speed and positioned in the air at about 140 degrees relative to my position when suddenly I lost sight of it, but seconds later a high altitude aircraft traveling at a high rate of speed approached the area where I had last seen the object.  The intercepting craft appeared to be coming from the direction of Lackland A.F.B.  Minutes later as I was arriving at my destination I witnessed the same fast traveling aircraft returning back in the direction of the base.  Visual contact with the unknown object lasted mere seconds but the whole event took place over a period of 8 minutes or so.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

I watched it until it flew out of sight over San Antonio.;2013-06-10 01:00:00;20 seconds;I watched it until it flew out of sight over San Antonio. During the mid to late 1970's between midnight to 0200 hours I was standing on our back patio on the Southside of San Antonio looking up at the night sky. It was a clear late summer / early fall evening.  Out of the North flying South was a bright flying object. It took me a couple of seconds to realize that if wasn't a jet or an airliner.  I was between 9 - 10 years old. I was and still am a huge science fiction fan. It wasn't the USS Enterprise or a Klingon Battlecruiser.  That would have been cool.  This was better!  The object was roundish to almost egg shaped. It had window's all around the sides. But only in the middle of the craft.  But they went all around the craft. The craft did spin but it also spun from end to end. If it had ends.  Hard to explain. There were no other craft in the sky. I was so enthralled it didn't occur to me to wake up my parents.  Looking back the object probably would've been gone by the time my folks would've gotten out of bed. Well! that's my story from my only UFO encounter of my life.  I'm now a former US Army MP and a 3 time OIF veteran.  I'm now a civilian police officer at Fort Sam Houston.  Also 80% disabled by the VA. Very glad you all have given people a forum to put down their UFO  experiences.  Good luck on your continued endeavors.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

The color of the sides was a pale yellow and the dome was a lighter color.   The object moved slowly and seemed parallel then tilted to the left approximately 60 degrees and continued slowly.  I kept sight of the object and it disappeared for approximately two seconds and reappeared further south approximately 500 ft away and it also dropped elevation approximately 300 ft.   The object continued slowly at a parallel motion for three seconds then disappeared again and I could not locate.   I stopped on side of road to locate for approximately 1 minute then proceeded home after I could not locate the object.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
