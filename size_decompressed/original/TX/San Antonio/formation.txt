10-15 White, blue lights in linear formation traveling in San Antonio sky this morning.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 05:52:00;1 minute;10-15 White, blue lights in linear formation traveling in San Antonio sky this morning. My husband was outside of our garage, I was about to step out into the garage. He told me to hurry up and look while pointing at the sky. It was early, the sky was still black, and clear except a few translucent, small clouds,and in that immediate area, not too many faint stars. There was a linear formation, perfectly straight,perfectly spaced, white blue lights traveling, maybe 10 to 15 lights in a row. They were not blinking at all. As I tried to record it with my phone, it started to go behind a small,transparent cloud. We thought I would be able to record it as soon as the front part, or leading lights passed to the other side, but it never did. It just seemed to disappear.  I don't know if it was our eyes, but we thought we could still see it, no longer moving, but extremely dimmed, in the cloud.... didn't see it again. This is the third time I have seen strange lights, but the first time in a linear formation...and all three times, I feel, IT seems to sense it is being noticed,  so it disappears.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
