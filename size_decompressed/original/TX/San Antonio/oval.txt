San Antonio UFO sighting in 1970 while parking with girlfriend.;1970-07-01 00:00:00;10.00 min.;San Antonio UFO sighting in 1970 while parking with girlfriend. When I was about 16, my girl friend and I were parking, she said look at that light.  I said its just a plane.  Later, she said, look its moving around.  I said its just a hellicopter.  Then she said look its coming closer,then it dropped came up over the oak trees, about 100 feet away.  An oval yellowish white glow, humming.  Scared ((deleted)), I started truck, threw it in reverse and hauled ass.  Later, I realized the only way from such a far distance away it could have zoomed in on us had to be from my girlfriend looking and thinking about it, some sort of mental thalepophe.

Daylight sighting of an oval shaped lighted phenomena appears and reappears several times;1971-09-15 10:30:00;1 minute;Daylight sighting of an oval shaped lighted phenomena appears and reappears several times I was sitting in my 7th grade math class at Riley Jr. High (now Martin Luther King jr. High) listening to, along with the rest of the class, the teacher's lecture.  It was a morning class, and I believe it was about 10:30 am.  I was sitting by the window and happened to look out toward the east (about 30 degrees to my right) and saw an odd lighted shape, sort of like the left half of a lighted oval, at about 20 degrees above the horizon.  Toward the east is an area with a few houses and about a half mile of heavily wooded and at the time undeveloped land on either side of Salado Creek (the creek was about a quarter mile to the east of the school and runs north to south ).  That land currently contains Martin Luther King Park.  It was a largely clear day, but it seemed as though the lighted oval was behind a patch of cloud.  This shaped did not appear to be a solid object.  There was no noise associated with this sighting.  There was no noise associated with this sighting and I do not recall seeing or hearing any other aircraft in the area.  While trying to figure out what this shape was, the shape faded away.  A few seconds later, the shape reappeared slightly to the right and above the first location.  This time it was brighter, with a distinct symmetrical oval shape to the phenomena, and bright white in the interior.  In the middle of this oval was what looked like a thin bright horizontal line, much like a filament in a light bulb, which was centered in the oval and taking up about half the horizontal dimension of this oval.  This central filament type light was bright, but not painful to look at.  At this point, there was no question in my mind that I was seeing something that was unlike any aircraft that I had ever seen.  San Antonio in 1971 had substantial Vietnam related military flight activity from Ft. Sam Houston, Randolph AFB, and Kelly AFB, especially the frequent low level helicopter flights of UH-1 Huey helicopters.  Whatever I was looking at was nothing like any military or civilian aircraft I have seen either before or since (as an adult, I became a licensed pilot and was an Air Force flight test engineer).  As I was about to get the attention of the classmate sitting in front of me it faded out once more.  It came into view a third time, again slightly above and to the left of the previous appearance.  Like the first view, it appeared to be behind some kind of mist or light cloud and was only partially visible, with the left and top part of the shape being visible.  The bright filament was not visible, and this time I could see what looked like a very small reddish tapered dome on top.  The tapered dome was relatively small, roughly one tenth the width of the full oval and about one fifth the thickness of the main oval.  After a few seconds, it faded away again.  I looked all around the sky for it and about ten seconds later saw almost directly overhead a white light fade in an out of view twice.  It did so at a rate roughly the same as the interval between the first three sightings of the phenomena.  However, these last two were more points of light and I could not discern any shape to it.  The entire sighting lasted roughly one minute.  I took a fair bit of ridicule about this whenever I mentioned it, so I kept quiet about it.  About two years later when I was in high school, a classmate (who I had never told about my sighting) related a story about some odd phenomena he saw one night in the same general part of town near Salado Creek.  When I asked him to explain how it looked, he described the oval shape and the filament type light in the middle.  I could not tell from his description if it was exactly the same phenomena I had observed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

In April of 2006 I filmed with a infrared camera what I believe to be something not of this world.  Floating with a smokey figure and moving up, down & slow then quickly.  This was all filmed in my front yard. I want to send my video to someone to have it analyzed.  I am willing to send a copy to you or maybe someone you know that knows about these things,,what ever it is. thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Daytime sighting on busy freeway, UFO landed.;2008-07-27 13:10:00;3 minutes or so;Daytime sighting on busy freeway, UFO landed. Hello, I am a 27 year old truck driver and My wife is a Registered nurse, we had a sighting a couple sundays ago. This is the first time we have ever seen a ufo.  I was driving my wife to work on Loop 1604 West in San Antonio Texas, Sunday July 27, 2008 at about 13:10. I was driving and she was looking outside the passenger window.  The sky was blue, no clouds in the sky, very sunny. She said she had seen this object  flying to her right, about 200 feet up.  She said she watched it for about a minute before she realized she didn’t know what it was and told me to look at it.  It was hard to see at first because it was sliver and was like a flat egg, it blended in so easily to the sky but I did finally see it and we watched it accelerate to a very fast pace and then slow down again, at this point it was in front of us, over the freeway.  Then it continued a steady pace to our left, and landed.  It went straight down to land, not like an airplane.   I wanted to exit and look for it but my wife did not want to. So we drove on.  It was not a helicopter and it was not an airplane.  We did not see any markings on it.  We did not take any pictures with our phones, when it was happening we were in such disbelief that we didn’t even think of takings pictures of it.  This happened before the 281 highway exit on 1604, it landed behind a Shopping center.  We do not think it was a remote control toy because of the distance it was traveling, the height and the speed is unlike anything we have ever seen.  This location is not near any military base. Has anyone else reported seeing this?;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Shiny, oval shaped object in the sky, hovering above San Antonio;2008-11-02 18:03:00;30 seconds;Shiny, oval shaped object in the sky, hovering above San Antonio I was driving northbound on I-37 entering the southern part of the downtown area in San Antonio, TX.  I spotted something shiny, hovering in the sky.   I pointed it out to my mother and we watched it for about 30 seconds. t was oval shaped, and at one point vanished and then reappeared for couple of seconds and it was gone. It was daylight, I-37 is a busy highway, we may not be the only people to have seen it.   I don't know how high it was, but I know it was not an airplane or anything I've ever seen.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
I witnessed a bright blue object that appeared to move downwards and vanish in about 2 seconds;2008-12-03 00:29:00;2 seconds;I witnessed a bright blue object that appeared to move downwards and vanish in about 2 seconds Please bear with me as my phone is all I have to work with. It was almost 12:30 at night when I was walking back to my apartment complex. I was walking through the grass in the front of the apartments that had a gate where u could get back in.  Anyways I was just about to the gate when I saw a very bright blue light out of the cirbir of my eye. I looked up at the sky and there was this blue oval looking object.  The object was I would have to say less than a half mile in the sky. It was there and gone as soon as I looked up at it. It appeared to be moving downward into a field right across the street. I was very scared of the fact that it moved so quickly and seemed to vanish before getting to the ground. There was no noise at all from the object. I would have to say I was less than 300 yards away from it as well.  As soon as I saw it vanish I felt chills.  The area where the object was has a lot of dear that roam around at night. I didn't see any dear in sight. It's about an hour after I have witnessed the unidenitifief object.  I still don't see any deer, and they are always coming into the field around this time from across the street where I spores the object.  Anyways like I said I looked up saw a blue oval looking object and as fast as I saw it, the thing shot downwards and appeared to vanish all within about 2 seconds.  That's as much information as I'm available to give about what I've seen.  It's late and I'm shooken up about it.  I hope my information helps.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
I witnessed a strange craft hovering not too far above me in the atmosphere and then it shot off at warp speed with no warning.;2009-08-24 15:00:00;30 seconds;I witnessed a strange craft hovering not too far above me in the atmosphere and then it shot off at warp speed with no warning. A friend in I were in her car in the drive thru of a fast food restaurant.  It was the middle of the day, and there were very few clouds in the sky.  I happened to look out my window and saw a medium-sized oval shaped craft hovering in the sky 45degrees to my right, with two distinct whie blinking lights on it.  I pointed it out to my friend, and we just sat and watched it for no more than 30 seconds.  Then all of a sudden, it started moving horizontally very slowly, and then it shot off vertically into the atmosphere, at I guess what you would call warp speed, and leaving behind a streak that disappeared within one second.  It was extremely fast, I'd only seen a craft move that fast in science fiction movies.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

Spacecraft seen by two people over power lines, poles, and electrical cables.;2018-02-14 20:00:00;25 minutes;spacecraft seen by two people over power lines, poles, and electrical cables On Wednesday, February 14, my husband and I returned to our San 	Antonio, Texas apartment complex at around 7:45 PM.  As we got out of 	the car we heard a loud rumbling, with a kind of chugging undertone, and it 	sounded unfamiliar.  When we got off the elevator and walked to our 	apartment we saw what appeared to be oval-shaped planes flying much too 	low… somewhat shocked, we walked inside our apartment, went to the large 	living room windows, and saw two spacecraft directly across the street, 	in the sky. 		They were a silver metallic color, larger than helicopters, and they 	“parked” directly above poles for electricity and cables.  There were two 	spacecraft, and one of them faced the other, a bit lower, and at an angle. 	I had a better view of the one on the right, and there two lit windows on the 	side – gold light.  Both of them were square, and one window was smaller 	than the other. 		No wings attached to the spacecraft. 		They were stationary over the power lines and the poles for 	approximately 20- 25 minutes.  I would come back to check if they were 	still there from time to time. When I was away from the window we heard 	the loud rumbling noise again. I went to the window – they were gone. 		I did hear the same rumbling two more times during the next 48 	hours, but no sighting. 		I should mention that previously on Monday, Feb. 12, I saw an owl in 	a tree through the same living room window. The tree it stood in is only about 	15 feet from these poles and power lines for electrical cables, etc!  And very 	unusual to see an owl here, and this close on a city street. 		The owl was asleep, woke up, and looked directly at me 		before it flew away.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

They move in a steady stream pausing every 30 seconds for another to appear or so, until 20 passed over. At first thought they were luminaries (bags with candles) they were completely uniform as if they were being launched.  About 4 minutes to pass over.

Fleet of red oval UFO's flying in formation high in the sky over bridge. ((Starlin satellites?));2020-10-13 20:00:00;10;Fleet of red oval UFO's flying in formation high in the sky over bridge. Inspecting locomotives and noticed 30 flying red orbs flying in formation over the bridge between 8 and 9 pm. My coworker was flagging up the track. They seemed like they were headed straight for us but when they reached a certain point they began to fade like they were flying away from us at the exact same point over the bridge. I don't have any photo or video evidence. The fleet seemed to have better things to do than to go off course.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
