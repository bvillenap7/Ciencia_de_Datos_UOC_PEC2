It changed colors as it streaked across the horizon, going from south to north, parallel to the ground but seeimg to arc downward as it disappeared over the northern horizon.   I expected an implosion and braced myself but neither saw nor heard any evidence of ground impact.  There was no tail, no stream, and no noise as it moved across the sky. It wasn't far away and it wasn't high above.  And, it was large. Can't say how large. If it had been a meteor it would have made a tremendous expolsion.  Meteors do not, I believe, move parallel to the ground.  Later, at work, I fouind out that another person, a woman, an English as a Foreign Language instructor as myself, had also seen the fireball that same morning at the same time.  In fact, she and her teenage daughter had seen it as they drove to the girl's school. There were no reports of sightings either in the newspapers or TV news broadcasts.

As we were heading to our cars, we were talking and not paying any attention to the night sky.  As we were walking through the downtown San Antonio skyscrapers, something caught my eye in the sky.  I suddenly noticed a small green ball of light weaving its way around a skyscraper directly above me and my friend.  It was so sudden and it streaked downtown but at the same time, the green ball of light was WEAVING through skyscapers!!  carefully avoiding to not crash into the skyscrapers.  As it streaked across, it left a green glowing trail as it sped away.  At the same time, two helicopters were giving chase.  But the odd thing about these helicopters were that they were silent.  I could not hear either helicopters rotors whirling, nor its engines running.  The whole incident took place quickly.  The green ball seen lasted about 2 seconds.  The seen helicopters lasted about 5 seconds.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

Witness was sitting on her porch at approximately midnight, looking to the southwest across the city.  Suddenly, an orange fireball, with a long yellow tail, appeared in the night sky, and moved from her right to her left in level flight just above the horizon.  She stated that it suddenly appeared, and then equally quickly, disappeared from her sight. She emphasized that it was not any kind of aircraft, and she felt that it was incompatible with a meteorite.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Observed amber bright light decending for apx. 20 seconds.;1999-10-01 00:30:00;30 seconds;Observed amber bright light decending for apx. 20 seconds. We had just picked up a friend after bowling.  Traveling North on Senior Rd observed bright amber light moving up and down.  It appeared to me that the light was landing (like you would expect our would look like landing on the moon).  It went down, then back up, then down.  We turned east (the object now to our left) and observed for a moment longer when it disappeared behind trees over the horizon.  This event was witnessed eariler by family about an hour eariler to their west (same area as we observed). I have reported the event to the National Institute for Discovery Science via the web as well.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

It never lost altitude or seemed to be falling. No sound was heard. A tail was following the object that continued to travel towards the east out of sight. It seemed to be traveling at a very high speed. It could not have been any aircraft currently manufactured by us at this time. It was a disturbing sight.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

Large, bright, orange, fireball-like sphere seen in San Antonio TX night sky;2010-10-09 21:42:00;3 - 5 Seconds;Large, bright, orange, fireball-like sphere seen in San Antonio TX night sky On Saturday 9 OCT 2010, at approximately 942 p.m. CST, while travelling S/SE-bound in Northwest San Antonio, TX (by Shavano Park), my significant other and I witnessed an unidentified object in the night sky. The sky was clear and the weather was calm it was not raining, snowing or foggy. The object was a single, large orange ball of light with a slight trail (also orange in color).  It darted from the right to the left in a 45 degree angle and did not emit fragments or particles.  The duration lasted approximately three to five seconds and the object was somewhat low in the sky. We have seen many meteors before and this did not appear to be a meteor.  The object was obviously not commercial or military aircraft, did not resemble a lightning ball and was definitely not an emergency flare.  The object was rather large but definitely smaller than the moon and appeared to be within our atmosphere.  The object entirely disappeared and did not fizzle out, burn up or make impact it was spherical and disappeared as such, without fragmenting.   The object did not emit any sound.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

Myself, my wife, and two of our kids witnessed 3 fireball like orbs that traveled in a straight line near Clark High School in San Antonio, Texas, in December 2012 at 8 pm.  They looked like they were on invisible rails they traveled so straight.  Then they started going faster as they moved away.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
70 to 115 Red-Orange balls of light traveling in a line across the skies over San Antonio, TX;2012-06-01 22:30:00;15-20 minutes;70 to 115 Red-Orange balls of light traveling in a line across the skies over San Antonio, TX Myself and 2 friends of mine were sitting in my friends front yard when he noticed something in the skies, I turned and looked and observed red-orange fireballs of light moving across the sky, when my friend noticed them, about 15 to 20 of these must have already passed, I stood and began counting these objects and asking for a camera, nobody had one, I  counted to 73 before I stopped counting and began simply observing them and trying to figure out what I was seeing. Another 50 or so must have gone by, one following another in a slanted but straight line, as if afixed to a wing, but I could see stars through them so they must not have been attached to anything. My friends and I had the eerie feeling that they were observing us observing them.  My friends neighbor, an elderly lady came home and she observed the lights as well, he then went in his house to call out his sister who also came out and observed the lights. The lights went across the sky from North to South, once the lights reached the end of the horizon they seemed to &quotblink out&quot.  Once one blinked out, another would appear on the north side horizon.  After about 20 minutes of this the last light appeared and followed the rest, from the rear of the last light it seemed as if a corner of a wing could be seen, yet, invisible.  Over the years I've seen UFO's before, but never anything on this scale, the sheer number of the objects was staggering. This was a major event, and yet, nobody repoted it.  Execpt me.  Hopefully others will come forward about this.  Thank you.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

My wife was taking pictures of the dark clouds when we heard a plane flying low.  We were looking at the plane flying over the houses.  As it was flying in one direction, we noticed a light come out of the clouds in front of the plane.  As the plane veered to the left, we kept watching the light come closer towards us.  As it flew over our house, it looked like a fireball with a red haze behind it.  That is when my wife took pictures of it in the sky.  We were able to take three pictures of it.  As it passed our house it disappeared in the clouds.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

Procession of 11 fireballs.;2016-12-30 18:30:00;10 minutes;Procession of 11 fireballs What I initially noticed was a large orange light that was kind of glowing rather than blinking like normal aircraft...  As I continued to watch the craft fly from right to left (south toward the north) about 50 degrees from the horizon I realized it's too big to be a Chinese lantern (about half the size of a dime held at arms length) and is not any kind of aircraft I am familiar with.. no other lights just one large glowing fireball.  It was flying at a normal airplane speed.. maybe a little slower and produced no sound.  About a minute later I see a second object flying from the same direction..  It to goes by then a third, a fourth..  I watch ten orange fireballs go by.  They were flying at different altitudes and distances, some are larger some smaller and have slightly different 'shape'.  The tops produced a slight halo of a lighter shade of orange.   I ran into the house and grabbed my iphone and came back outside in time to film the final one go by.  I think it was 11 total but it may have been 12.  It was like a ufo parade.  Very strange.  I'm certain others must have seen it as they flew across the whole of east and north San Antonio.  After they left a couple airplanes, possibly military, flew past the general area.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
New Years @ ~12:30am, my father and I observed an object in the sky appearing red at a distance but then turned bright orange.;2017-01-01 00:30:00;2 minutes;On new years at about 12:30am, my father and I observed an object in the sky appearing red at a distance but then turned bright orange with a flicker of red as it flew closer. The object hovered over our street originating from the south. It flew in a quarter circle pattern over the convent property across from us as it dimmed its light and dissapeared. Two identical objects followed after the first object in the same pattern at the same speed and dissapeared at the exact same spot as the first. The only conclusion I can come to, what ever they were, they must have been drawn by the fireworks. They appeared to have been observing them as they hovered over our street at a very low altitude. I never saw an aircraft, nor did I hear an engine sound or propeller sounds and it made no contrail as it flew by. I only saw three separate individual orange redish lights in the sky. And the weather conditions for 01/01/2017 at 12:58am central time in San Antonio TX is,  Weather conditions were clear  Temperature 48 degrees farenheight  Dew point was 46 degrees  Humidity was 94%  Barometric pressure was 29.83  Wind speed was 0 mph from the north.
