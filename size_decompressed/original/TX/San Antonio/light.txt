I saw a diagonal line / with several lights.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 05:50:00;1 minute;I was on my way to drop my son off in Pleasanton, Tx for work, when I looked up and saw a diagonal line / with several lights going in a straight line, almost looking like the side of a disk , but I cant be certain because how straight the line was, I though at first it was a firework about to go off, then noticed it was getting bigger as if it were coming closer, I then leaned forward and my son asked what was a looking at, I still thought I was seeing a shooting star maybe, then noticed it was not going anywhere,  I yelled for him to look as I grabbed his arm, he looked and was as stunned as I was, I said what is that??! He was freaking out, then as I tried to take out my camera we saw it fade to the east of us!!!! I have no reason to lie , I have no reason to make this up, we are now believers of something is out there!! I am SHOOK!!!!!;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
