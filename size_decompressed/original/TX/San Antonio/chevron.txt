Two intense bright diamond shaped craft seen.;2007-01-18 22:55:00;15 min.;Two intense bright diamond shaped craft seen. I was outside waiting for AAA to arrive because I had a flat tire and I didn’t have any tools. I was with my brother talking about how it was a cloudy night and couldn’t see any stars. That’s when a very bright yellow light appeared. You could see this light pass through the clouds, that’s how powerful that light was. It was low in the horizon and just hovered in the sky. A couple minutes later a second bright yellow light appeared next to it about a football field length away. It wasn’t as bright as the first and it too hovered in place. After about 5 minutes of staring at it, they began to alternate in brightness. One would get dim and the other brighter. I had never seen anything like this before. After about 5 minutes of that, one of the lights began to move away in a southwest direction. It was slow moving but as it passed overhead the light disappeared. While this was happening the other light remained hovering in place. After the 1st light dimmed out the second light followed in the same direction and passed closer to us where I could make out the shape of the object. It was diamond shaped and had bright yellow lights on each corner. It too dimmed out and vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

As I pulled out of a gas station, I saw a UFO hover over me.;2007-11-02 03:59:00;40-45seconds;As I pulled out of a gas station, I saw a UFO hover over me. I was pulling out of the gas station and turning on to the main road headed to work. I was adjusting my mirror when i glanced up & noticed 2 lights. Not the normal lights of an airplane that you would normally see that flash. These 2 Lights were not as bright either. The lights were circular and appeared to be on each ends of the chevron shape. Then in the middle i noticed a red light not as big as the other light I would say about half the size of the other light which appeared to be about the same size as the wing. For a minute i thought maybe it is a plane or maybe it's just a helicopter so i rolled the window down but no noise. Certainly if it was one the 2 aircrafts i would hear something. Then I noticed it was flying way too slow to be an airplane or helicopter. It almost seemed as it was hovering over but it was moving. I drove under it and lost sight then I looked in the mirror to see it because I was still coming to grasp with what I saw. But when I looked in the mirror I didn't see it. I thought maybe the angle I was at didn't allow me to see so I turned the car around, and to my suprise it was gone completely from the sky. I looked around to see maybe it just trailed off but i was gone.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

Object quietly glides of neighborhood-no lights no sound!!;2009-05-10 21:30:00;15 secs;Object quietly glides of neighborhood-no lights no sound!! Hi, I was just wondering if any people have reported any ufo sightings near 1604/281 area. I saw something flying low, blackish-gray boomerang shaped, no lights, no sound, gliding slowly over the neighborhood around 2130 sunday night. I thought it was a flock of birds but it never broke formation and was to perfect of a shape, and there is noway it was a plane because it had no lights or sound, plus a plane flew over, in a different direction, maybe 30 seconds after in which I could hear sound and see blinking lights on it, at a much higher altitude.  Two other people saw the ufo fly over also and none of us have ever seen anything like it before.  Just checking to see if any other reports have came in.  If you have any questions please call or email me.  Thanks;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Multiple witnesses observe stationary, highly-reflective object in daytime sky.  Triangular??;2010-07-31 14:20:00;15 min.;Multiple witnesses observe stationary, highly-reflective object in daytime sky.  Triangular?? July 31, 2010, 2:15 PM, the weather was clear, no sign of clouds, only blue sky with an occasional commercial aircraft approaching from the north heading towards the San Antonio International airport to the southwest.  We are located at the outer limits of approach aircraft. The object appeared as a bright reflective object, located N30E, approximately 30 to 35 degrees above the horizon.  I was located in our backyard swimming pool, the bright object and relatively stationary appearance caught my attention.   I have seen high flying aircraft, rising party balloon, birds during the daytime.  But this object did not fit those observations.  This object was somewhat stationary and seemed to rise like a balloon, but never this bright and never a shape which seemed to rotate, vary in brightness and shape. Object seemed to hover and slightly rise in the sky until it just vanished.  At one point when the object seemed to nearly disappear, observation what I thought was a much larger triangular object, just catching a straight edge about twenty diameters in length as compared to the bright object (no color, bright white starlike).  It disappeared shortly thereafter.   I looked for it but never saw it again.  The duration of this observation lasted about 15 min.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
