Black triangular craft in San Antonio;1994-06-25 10:00:00;10 minutes;Black triangular craft in San Antonio This would have been in either late June or early July 0f 1994. I was a Latin student (the dead language, not... you know.)  We had a high school team competing in a game called Certamen -- very much like the game show Jeapordy.  After school was let out for the summer, we continued to practice, most of the time at our teacher's [huge, nice] house.  But we had a few practices at my house and those of the other three teammates. Sorry for that bloviating intro...  One night I was driving myself, my brother and my best friend Jason back from our teammate Erin's house.  The stretch of road we were on was not lit by streetlights, so it was really, really dark. [And a hand-me-down '76 Honda Civic can't really light things up well. I did love that car!]   So we were on a dark road, and I don't remember which but either my brother or my friend looked out of the window and he was like What the f*** is that thing?  I had no clue what they were talking about -- I was concentrating on driving with virtually no visibility. When I finally looked up to see what the heck was the matter, there was a large, black triangular 'something' flying right above us.  Well, that road had a lot of tall trees, so probably the craft were flying at like 100 feet.  It had one white light on each of the corners or vertices.  I think they were constant instead of blinking, but I had two of my favorite people in my car, so still: drive safely. Whatever it was, it was following my car, at 40 or 45 mph, whatever the speed limit was. I know of no aircraft which can keep aloft at that slow of a speed [and I'm an aircraft-nerd].  I think even the single-engine Cessnas have to maintain 70-75 or they'll stall out and drop. The thing was way too big to have been a helicopter, plus it made no noise that I could hear.  It hovered above us almost all the way to my friend's house, which was in a very well-lit neighborhood.  As soon as we got into the lighted area: whoosh! No more shadow-craft shadowing us. We still could see it for a minute or two from Jason's driveway, on account of the lights.  I guess whoever or whatever was flying it wasn't in a terrible hurry to get away from us. I make no claim that it were some kind of alien tech.  We're in San Antonio, and back then we had four major Air Force bases.  The craft may well have been some experimental USAF test-bed.  But dang if I know how the thing could perfectly follow three kids obeying the speed limit.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
My girlfriend and I report seeing 7 lights in a boomerang shape object going east flying very slowly.

The object was about 100 yards up from the ground and about 50 yards wide.The object from us was n/e about 200 yards,with no plane engine sounds. My girlfriend and I were going to the movies when we saw this object. We were at a mall about to go underground to the theatre.When we saw a bunch of lights flickering like a strobelight' with colors of green,blue,red,white,and yellow.We got as close as we can to the object,which was about 200 yards.I got out of the car because I could not figure out what this object was. I could not see a shape just a form of a boomerang that was 50 yards or more wide.It lasted about 15 seconds then trees and buildings blocked our view.There is no way we were the only people to see these lights,they were to bright and the object was to big.The mall we were at was Windsor park mall in the city of SanAntonio next to a smaller city called Windcrest but still Bexar county.It flew over a major street called Walzem Rd.,That's how I know we were not the only observers.My girlfriend and I only saw it for about 15 seconds but it was going slowly to the east and we were facing northeast. The sun was !just going down behind us, so we were facing the night sky. That's why we could not see a structure I guest, unless it was 7 different objects flying in a perfect formation with no sounds of engines. I THINK NOT!

The event occured about 15 after noon on march 3rd 1999 in San Antonio, texas.  I was delivering pizzas and just stepped outside the store to make a run.  I noticed two gentlemen looking up at the sky and i looked also.  I saw at about 1 o'clock high a intermittingly flashing object.  I thought it was a bird at first because it seemed to be floating on an air current.  But it appeared to be reflecting light.  It was changing from white to invisable to red.  It was angular in shape. But i got the feeling that it may have been a sphere with angular panels on it and that it may have been spinning and reflecting light from the sun.  It reminded me of when I have held a rock in my hand and turned it over and the different facets catch the light and reflect it back at me.  It just seemed to hover for a few minutes then began to descend.  This is the tricky part.  It appeared to descend but it did not change size.  It just dropped from 11 o' clock where it started to about 9 o' clock on my left then went across from my left to my right across the sky and continued to descend to about 3 o' clock where it went below the horizon line.  I wwas told the entire event lasted about 15 minutes.  The part i witnessed lasted about 5 minutes.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Blue energy egg beamed down from spacecraft over San Antonio Texas eludes airport radar.;2000-03-17 04:00:00;2 minutes;Blue energy egg beamed down from spacecraft over San Antonio Texas eludes airport radar. On a saturday night mid march (either the weekend of march 12 or 18th)2000 at approximately 4:00 am, myself and a friend who are avid skywatchers and stargazers observed a triangle shaped craft moving from south to north directly overhead in northwest san antonio texas. The craft emitted a blue laser beam from the craft to the ground and a blue egg shaped object which looked like it was comprised of millions of tiny particles of energy,was beamed down to the earth from this craft as if from some star trek movie. The blue egg shaped object was carefully projected down the laser beam and once it was released at ground level the laserbeam retracted back into the spacecraft.  We had the local airport tower on the phone during the event and the airtraffic controller on duty assured us that there was nothing on the radar fitting this description and that the only thing they had on radar was a medivac unit coming into san antonio from boerne flying from west to east into the airport.The air seemed to buzz with an electric/static during the event, and as soon as the blue egg was released from the beam the spacecraft took off at an extremely high rate of speed then disappeared.Could anyone tell us what it was that we witnessed being beamed down ? Was this of an alien nature or that of our own governme Thanks, ((Name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports about this incident, that we are aware of.  It is not clear what date the witness is alluding to, the 12th or 13th, the 17th or 18th of March.  We will attempt to clarify with witness.  PD));29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
The only dissapointment of it all is i DIDDNT have my camcorder on me.;2003-05-26 20:30:00;10 min;The only dissapointment of it all is i DIDDNT have my camcorder on me. This was a weird experience and difficult to explain, but here it goes...My friends and I were sitting on the back porch of my friends  apt complex.  We noticed a stream of smoke coming from the ground up, from a Jet.  From the angle of it, and how it was flying gave the impression of a missle being launched in the middle of the city...sounds stange but totally true.  It looked like a missle being launched or a rocket, even the space shuttle.  But it had to be just a jet flying over head?? Anyway, as we were sitting on my friends back porch talking about this, One of my fiends spotted a dark odject floating in the sky and moving right toward us, but way up high. And moving fast. Not real fast but fast. It seem as if it were being propelled by wind like a kite or a balloon,but is was moving very directly...this is hard to explain but thats how it was. The sun was setting at this time but there was still plenty of light. And this thing flew right over us.still way up high.  at this point we were able to see that this thing looked like a large bat wing...kind of like Batmans bat jet from the movies. It was dark, solid, and had no lights on it at all.  and it was silent. no sound at all could be heard from it.  Stranger still is the we live in San antonio city, the whole city was awake and moving and I dont think anyone else in this whole city saw this incredibly amazing weird flying thing...just us.

A peach colored blob moved straight toward me, became a triangle craft, turned around and vanished;2004-05-13 03:00:00;15-20 seconds;A peach colored blob moved straight toward me, became a triangle craft, turned around and vanished A friend and I were driving West on the frontage road of I-10 at about 3:30 AM Thursday May 13, 2004. The passenger and I both recognized a golden peach colored blob in the distance almost at the exact same time. We quickly agreed it was on a direct path for my vehicle and just as my friend suggested i think it's a meteorite, I slowed down and the golden peach colored blob became a large defined triangle with bright light blue circular lights that ran horizontally across the bottom of the craft. The Chevron (gas) symbol is very similar to what the craft resembled, but it was a peachy color. As my friend leaned foward to get a better view he shouted,  There it is! The craft did an about face and disappeared quicker than anything I've seen. This was the most bizarre moment in my life. And oh by the way I was terrified.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

A friend and I were driving west on I-10 in San Antonio on the access road. We both noticed a triangular golden colored object moving closer and closer at about the same time. His first words were,  this [flying object] is going to hit us. As the flying object got closer I noticed it was lined with glowing dots that ran horizontally across the bottom. I yelled out, stop! three or four times frantically as a reaction to this bizarre flying craft getting closer and closer. There it is, said my passenger as he pointed directly above us. By that time the flying object that first seemed to be on a crash course with my vehicle vanished into the 3am San Antonio sky. This 10-15 second experience was one of the most electrifying moments in my life.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

At that time i notice had lights blinking in the sky.This was strange cause the noise was being generated by this object in the sky.The reason why this was strange was the fact the intense light i notice were strobing i have never see this pattern on a aircraft before.Thats not only thing strange had more light on it then any aircraft i see.I have lived by Kelly AFB all my life and always seen planes but this was totaly different from any aircraft i have ever seen.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Three separate sightins which ocurred in rural south Texas between 01/01/03 and 03/01/09.;2006-01-01 23:00:00;1: 45 minutes;Three separate sightins which ocurred in rural south Texas between 01/01/03 and 03/01/09. I have lived in various towns South Texas since 1999.  Since 2004, I have worked outdoors most if this time, mostly at night with minimal light pollution from large cities.  I have three separate sightings to report with no specific dates, regrettably.  All I cab say is that the first sighting occurred after 01/01/06 before 2007.  The second sighting occurred between 01/03/09 and 02/20/09.  The third sighting occurred between 04/01/09 and 05/15/09.  The first two sightings occurred while I was working.  The last sighting occurred during my off time.  I will recount my experiences here. All three sightings occurred in the rural Texas landscape in between Del Rio, Texas to the west, San Antonio, Texas to the north, Corpus Christi, Texas to the east and Laredo, Texas to the south.  In between these four cities are smaller, rurally populated towns.  Outside of the towns are millions of acres of privately owned ranch land that is inaccessible to few consisting of ranch owners, their families, hunters and in areas closer to the Mexican border, the U.S. Border Patrol. I’d like to emphasize that this area in between the aforementioned cities is sparsely populated and dominated by private land.  Also, after I had observed the objects in all three sightings, I believed the aircraft to be military.  The cities of Del Rio and San Antonio have Air Force installations.  The city of Corpus Christi has a Naval Air Station.  There is also a bombing range approximately 30 to 40 miles east of Cotulla, Texas on Farm to Market Road (FM) 624. I will report these observations as clearly and accurately as I can, devoid of any opinion or speculation.  I did mention earlier that I believed these objects to be military, but that’s based on the fact that these events occurred within the triangle of those installations where there are several remote miles to operate in without many eyewitness accounts. FIRST SIGHTING: I was with a coworker traveling westbound on the FM Road 133 which connects Artesia Wells, Texas (LaSalle County) to Catarina, Texas (County).  Both towns are sparsely populated and are surrounded by dense brush for several miles.  Artesia Wells is a town of probably 20 that is approximately 50 miles north of Laredo, Texas, outside of it’s city limits and maybe 90 miles outside of San Antonio, Texas.  Artesia Wells is on IH-35 in a heavily traveled stretch of highway that is relatively clo0se to the Mexican border. FM 133 is maybe 15 to 20 miles long and only runs from Artesia Wells to Catarina.  There are no tons in between Artesia Wells and Catarina.  Catarina has a population of maybe 50 or more, if not less. I am not certain as to the time of year, and do not want to speculate.  I do remember that I initially observed the object approximately 10 miles west of Catarina and thought that it was a low flying aircraft.  This was about 45 minutes before sunset.  Approximately 5 miles outside of Catarina, both my coworker and commented that the aircraft did not appear to be moving.  The object was several miles west of the FM 133 and Highway 83 intersection just south of Catarina. The object appeared to be black in color, triangular shaped with no lights or visible markings.  The object did not make any sounds that I could hear.  Also, the object appeared to be hovering.  The object’s hover was not consistent with that of a helicopter in that a helicopter moves up and down and side to side as it hovers.  This object appeared to be perfectly still.  I did not notice and type of exhaust emitting from the vehicle. My coworker and I attempted to get as close as we could to the object via dirt roads.  The dirt roads we were on took us due south and not west.  The object appeared to be hovering over brush.  From my position, I couldn’t identify any land monuments to pinpoint the object’s location.  There were only trees and plants below the object.  I still would like to say that my coworker and I were still around about 10 miles or so from the object. We watched the object until the sun set.  The object remained stationary for the duration.  My coworker and I attempted to get the object’s attention by pointing flashlights at it and using flashing lights while we were stationary. At sun set, the object became impossible to see with the naked eye.  I used night vision goggles to view the object.  With very little sub light being used as a light source, I could clearly see the object at the same location, still stationary.  My coworker observed the object through the night vision equipment as well. It was at this time that we left the area.  The object was not visible after sun set.  The object did not appear to have any lights. SECOND SIGHTING: I was working alone near the Artesia Wells area between the hours of 2200 and 0100 hours when I observed lights in the sky.  I was traveling westbound on a rural ranch road one mile south of Artesia Wells and approximately one mile from IH-35 when I first saw a bright light in the sky. On this night, the sky was clear and there did not appear to be any clouds in the sky.  I was I was traveling westbound, a bright light that I can best describe as resembling a headlight caught my eye.  The light was very bright and flashed on and off before disappearing.  There appeared to be lights north of this light’s location these lights seemed relatively close to the first light. I observed the very bright “headlight” and the others for only a couple of seconds.  I continued traveling west until I reached IH-35.  I parked my vehicle, got out and attempted to signal the area where I observed the light with my flashlight. I was at the intersection of IH-35 and FM 133 when I attempted to signal this light.  At this point the light was not visible.  I scanned the sky and observed a high flying aircraft that could have been a plane.  This object was traveling southbound on the east side of IH-35 but crossed over IH-35 traveling westbound.  Shortly after crossing over, the object began to travel north.  It took the object between 8-12 minutes before it disappeared out of sight due to distance.  Another aircraft appeared to be several miles behind it. I turned my attention back to the west sky where I observed three high hovering objects.  These objects appeared to be in a triangular formation.  I could not make out any shapes or sizes.  The lights on these objects appeared to be consistent with conventional aircraft.  They omitted a white beacon every couple of seconds or so.  These objects did not appear to have the typical red port side light or green starboard side light that many aircraft and vessels have.  They remained stationary for several minutes, flashing. I attempted to signal these objects as well, to no avail. To characterize the initial object, I’d say it was about the size of a military flare.  I did not emit smoke and a shadow like military flares and did not appear to be descending under a parachute like a military flare.  It is best described as a single vehicle headlight in the sky.  This object was not a radio or cell phone tower light and was not a vehicle.  It was too high in the sky to be mistaken for vehicle. This entire experience lasted about 30 minutes. THIRD SIGHTING: On this particular evening, I was traveling home from a shopping trip in Laredo, Texas with my family when my daughter, my wife and I observed an object in the sky.  I was at about the 27 mile marker of IH-35, two miles south of the Border Patrol checkpoint when I observed 4 to 5 bright lights, lined up within three to four times their width from each other.  These objects appeared to be in a much disciplined formation.  These objects appeared consistent with the object I saw in my second sighting.  The objects were very bright and appeared similar to headlights.  They flashed off sequentially, starting with the southern most light.  These lights were in the western sky. I immediately notified my wife and daughter and they too saw the lights.  I did not stop to investigate or signal to them.  I continued traveling northbound until arrival at the Border Patrol checkpoint. The 27 mile marker is approximately 27 miles form the Mexican border.  The lights appeared to be hovering over rural densely brushed and sparsely populated ranches.  There are no major towns or cities northwest of Laredo, Texas that would line up directly west of the 27 mile marker.  The nearest town would be Catarina which is several miles north of Laredo on Highway 83.  The next nearst town would be Encinal, which is 39 miles north on IH-35.

V-Shape, lighted craft seen in San Antonio just over tree line.;2006-02-28 22:00:00;3 Minutes;V-Shape, lighted craft seen in San Antonio just over tree line. First of all, let me say that my father and uncle, two very normal men claim to have been ubducted.  I am very skeptical, myself, but I cannot identify what my girlfriend and I saw that night.  Right above tree line was a v-shaped craft. At first only three lights shined on each point of the triangle. The lights were similar to those new, almost blue, lights you see on some cars (neons?). The craft was moving too slow to be a regular plane. It couldn't have been a helicopter. A few moments later, more lights came on. I didn't count exactly but I'd estimate a total of 7 lights at this point. The object speeded up a little and eventually moved out of sight.  It sounded like...? Wind? Like a very quite plane, but no engine sound.  Wish I had known to count and notice direction. I was in shock at the time. Wasn't really thinking about anything else except to watch it...  I have to note that there IS a military base nearby, so perhaps the object I saw was some new test plane? I have no idea. It was the weirdest thing I have ever seen.

I was driving home from downtown San Antonio and witnessed a series of  crafts with strange lights on Highway 281 for an hour or so.;2006-03-10 00:30:00;12:30 A.M.-1:40 A.M.;I was driving home from downtown San Antonio and witnessed a series of  crafts with strange lights on Highway 281 for an hour or so. On March 10, 2006 I was driving on Highway 281 at 12:30 A.M. past the Alamo Dome in downtown San Antonio when a large bright white light caught my eye ahead in the sky about 1-2 football fields high(the craft stayed about that far away the whole sighting). At first I thought it was a tower light or something like that but when I got closer to this object it eventually got right above my car in the middle of the highway. I then saw the bottom of the object. It was triangular in shape with red and blue lights on the three corners blinking. I watched it until I had passed it.  Astonished and terrified, I decided to take the next turnaround and go back and see if what I saw was real or not. When I got back to the place of the first sighting, I  no longer saw the craft in the middle of the road but instead I saw the object near the lookout tower on the opposite side of the highway to the right of the tower. I then decided to take the next turnaround and find a spot to park on the side of the road to get a better look. But when I got near the tower again on the highway there was a 2nd craft that was smaller and had red and orange lights as opposed to the red and blue lights of the larger craft. I should also note that every time I saw these things during the hour of my sighting the crafts top bright light kept turning on and off randomly.  When I saw this second craft I got scared because it proceeded to come straight towards me. This smaller    red and orange craft eventually went right over me like the larger one did before. This craft looked like the first one did, triangular in shape only with red and orange lights on the bottom at the three corners. It also had a top bright light as well. It passed me and went to the right of me on the highway and then immediately changed directions and joined the larger craft on the left side of me on the highway quite fast. At this point I was not about to pull over and stop as these things were just too close for comfort. I was shaking, I honestly don’t know hwy I was so scared.  Instead I just kept taking turnarounds and went in circles about 3 times until they disappeared. I saw them going back and forth across Highway 281 every time I turned around. It is almost as if they were following me, playing some kind of game. It’s kind of  egocentric of me to think that these things were there only for me but at the time is how I felt which is probably why I did not want to stop on the side of the road for a constant look at these things.  When they were no longer to be seen I headed back to my original destination point, home. About 5-10 minutes later I was near the University of Incarnate Word still on Highway 281 when I saw the small red and orange craft yet again on my left side no less than a football field high. I could not believe that it was near me again. It proceeded to cross my path giving me another view of its bottom and headed to my right until I passed it up.  So I took the next turnaround yet again and when I got back it was gone. I then went ahead and drove a few more minutes before taking the next turnaround to finally go home. But when I got back the larger blue and red craft had returned and was approaching my left side until it got right overhead of me again. This time however I saw a bright beam of light that looked like those airplane beams you see near an airport or major highway shoot out of the bottom of the craft and proceeded to point it EVRYWHERE. When I say everywhere I mean it pointed it at cars, buildings and houses nearby. The odd thing was it never once pointed it at me. At least I think, though now that I think about it when I saw the craft overhead the light was so bright I had to shield my eyes for a second so it might have shined it on me at once. It very much looked to me like it was searching for something. After it got done with the beam it went on its way to the right of me and I lost site of it when I got too far from it. I should note that when it did this i got a pretty good look at the side of the craft. It looked disk shaped. I was scared enough that i went home.  Before I got home however I saw the small red and orange craft flying over 281 and towards my neighborhood near Brook Hollow Blvd until I lost sight of it beyond the trees on the horizon.  It was around 1:40 A.M. when I got home.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Triangular aircraft tumbling on it's side!;2006-03-16 20:00:00;5 seconds;Triangular aircraft tumbling on it's side! I was driving down a street at night and saw lights ahead of me and to the right out of the corner of me eye. I saw what appeared to be a triangle on it's side at about a quarter mile ahead and just above the tree line. I could not see the triangle shape, but saw lights at each corner (three lights) that made up a form of a triangle. The lights were not blinking. I do not recall if there was a blinking light or not anywhere on the object. The aircraft appeared to be on it's side and appeared to be tumbling forward. It then leveled off and made a 90 degree turn. This aircraft was going very fast. This sighting took place about a mile from Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. I do not know what this aircraft was, but I do know three things: 1) I have never seen an aircraft tumble forward and then level off in this manner. 2) I have never seen an aircraft travel at the rate of speed it was traveling. 3) I know of no aircraft that can make a 90 degree turn at this rate of speed, although the B-2 Stealth Bomber comes close, but I know that it does not tumble on its side.

We saw a craft that was very large with what appeared to be moving very slow with two huge what appeared to be large turbine engines that were not making any noise but the craft was moving.  In an instance the craft was gone with no trace of the what I think were the engines that shined very brightly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Aurora/U.F.O. sighting in San Antonio;2007-07-27 12:00:00;10 minutes;Aurora/U.F.O. sighting in San Antonio At approximately 12:00AM on July 27th, 2007 my brother and I were outside and  I noticed a glowing yellow ball hovering over Bush Middle school and told my brother. He quickly told me it was probably just a plane. It started rising higher and higher but not coming any closer so we started walking down our couldesac to go check it out. We walked closer and it seemed as if two human objects were glowing in the sky. The objects weren't lights, as they were just a very bright glow. As I am a christian and never believed in U.F.O.'s I thought the second coming of christ was happening and told my brother.  We were drawn to the glowing objectst by curiousity. It hovered high for about ten minutes and the two glowing balls seemed to turn back into one glowing ball. It almost is as if it knew we were there. We ran back home scared and it's almost as if it followed us. We looked over head and it's almost as if it slowed down, not like any plane can do but rather fast. Then we both saw it overhead and it looked like some type of plane but with a triangular shaped torso. It took off very fast and had basically no noise whatsoever. I heard what sounded like little girls singing, but I'm not sure if this was the sound of the plane or not.  I did some research and found out about the Aurora project and looked at videos on Youtube and Google articles, it looks similiar to those projects but still not entirely sure, it seemed to all happen so fast. I now am a firm believer that I U.F.O.'s exist, regardless if it was exrtra terrestials or a government project. My brother called the non emergency policy number and told the lady he was a college student that wasn't prank calling or doing drugs. They said they would have somebody check it out. Good luck with that! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
San Antonio, TX. September 2008 - 3 Witnesses - Triangular Formation in the sky.;2008-09-15 12:00:00;About 5 Minutes;San Antonio, Tx. September 2008 - 3 Witnesses - Triangular Formation in the sky. Im telling this exactly as it happened because I think alot of people don't come forward like they should so I'm telling what I saw.  Unfortunatley, I never thought of reporting it til now, but this is how it went. It happned around mid september 2008 in San antonio Tx, on the Southeast side.  Me and my friends ((male name #1 deleted)) and ((male name #2 deleted)) were walking we were about a little past ((female name deleted)) coming down Schley going the west when Nathan told us to look in the sky,I didnt see it at first until my friend nathan pointed it out, but when I did I was like What the hell is that!!!   The thing seemed to be about a mile away and it didnt seem to do much but move real slow.  But let me tell you, I watch the History channel and seen about stealth but damn this was like nothing I've ever seen.  The thing would kinda glow on and off to where when it would glow, there were about 20, what I guess could be called bulbs, floating in a triangular formation that would turn white, but then it turned transparent. It continued to do this at about a rate of 1 pulse every 2 seconds, fading white then gone, white then gone, non stop. The thing moved real slow and kinda, came towards our way as we were walking. The whole time I was freaking out to seeing something like that. At one point I tried to take a picture but my camera phone wasnt able to zoom that far or even make it out at all. So we continued looking at it until it went behind some trees and we couldnt see it anymore. Just for the refrence,  This thing was not a plane, It was not birds, or a meteroite or any natural occurance for that matter. It was something beyond my undertanding. I've never seen a plane fly that slow either, it just cant be done... I've seen planes all my childhood when my dad worked on them. This was not a plane! And I've never seen a bird change colors before. We know what we saw and I will put it on everything to stand by it. But what could this possibly mean?  Are they here to observe us?  Or is it the government?     -Thank you ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Triangular lights directly overhead moving silently and slow then saw edge of craft in moon light (circular).;2010-04-09 23:15:00;25-30 sec.;Triangular lights directly overhead moving silently and slow then saw edge of craft in moon light (circular). Hello, I am a witness to a flying saucer,  my buddy already filed a report but my buddy got a call from the lead investigator, who told my buddy for me to make my own report.  So, this is my report. As we were walking our dogs, my buddy decided to drop his dogs off and then go back to my house. As I was waiting outside I wanted to look for the big dipper because it was pretty clear outside.  Then directly overhead I noticed what I thought was a flock of geese in a V pattern.  To my amazement the Geese were not Geese, I was looking at a brilliant V shape set of lights.  I watched them directly and clearly right above me, moving very slow and silent. I could not believe what I was looking at.  It was what I’ve come to know as a UFO.  As soon as I could I called for my friend, come here and look!  As he dashed outside I was pointing straight up at the craft.  He then saw it himself.  We watched, without blinking for about 25-30sec. until the craft traveled out of eyesight. What I saw was seven lights in a triangular formation traveling east at a very slow pace. As it moved away I caught a glimpse of what looked to be more than the V pattern itself, it was a dark circular shape around the lights.  It was HUGE!  At arms length the object was at least 3 inches wide.  It looked, to my perspective that it was at an altitude of one – two miles.  I could not understand what I was looking at, but I knew it was there (right above us).  Nothing will ever change my mind about what I saw, knowing that it will never be erased from my mind. Thanks for this website.  My friend and I will always be linked by this event I Just wished it lasted longer.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

2 spacecraft and huge blue light in the sky;2011-10-12 21:00:00;15 minutes;2 spacecraft and huge blue light in the sky I was just heading home and while driving on the freeway on 410 going west I saw the triangular spacecraft(one only at first on my right side) cruising at medium speed high up in the sky definately looking/waiting for something. My intuition felt that there was some sort of rare threat as I also saw a few more law enforcement than usal on the freeway, so  thought this could've been an advance military spacecraft or something on the lookout..    But then the second one showed up looking the same as the first on my left.  They had some distance but were pretty close to each other basically facing each other at a perfect line for a few minutes...until this huge blue light filled the sky for just a second.  This light was so powerful and bright and seemed like some kind of explosion.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

April 5, 2014, @10:30pm, at highway 151, San Antonio, TX.   Six red lights formed a triangle with two at the tail end.   Weather, light rain and cloudy.   Formation speed was fast but not as fast as a flying jet.  They looked to be closer to the ground unlike air planes.   After 15 minutes, it was traveling with no sound then it disappeared in to the night clouds.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
UFO sighting.;2014-04-05 22:30:00;15 minutes;Me and my girlfriend were traveling down 410 exiting onto Hwy 151, when I witnessed something out of the norm in the sky to the south of us.   I noticed 6 objects to the left of me that looked bright fire red in the sky.  The objects were formed in a triangular shaped with one of the objects in the center, the other 2 objects were to the right of the triangular shape one atop of the other.  Not moving just at a stand still.  Couldn't been a plane or helicopter I told my girlfriend if she can see what I was seeing.  She then was just as curious as I was, she told me to exit Hwy 151, and I then proceeded onto Ingram Rd.  By then the objects began to move in a slow pace parting from each other. The skies were cloudy and a light mist, couldn't have been chinese lanterns,  we then parked our vehicle in a suburban area, which the objects the began to disappear one by one into the clouds traveling towards the west in a very slow speed.   We then researched after and there have been actual eyewitness of the same objects we spotted.   We do believe it was an actual UFO sighting without a doubt.   No blinking lights so this couldn't have been an aircraft.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Large Black Triangle With 3 Orange Lights Seen In Northwest San Antonio, TX Sky Over Treetops;2014-05-21 22:06:00;10-20 seconds;Large Black Triangle With 3 Orange Lights Seen In Northwest San Antonio, TX Sky Over Treetops Tonight, 21 May 2014, in San Antonio, Texas, at approximately 10:06 p.m. CST, I was driving northeast bound on Woodstone Dr. towards Vance Jackson Rd, and saw a large black triangle shaped object in the sky.  The triangle had 3 orange lights on the underbelly, one close to each corner, but not directly on the corners.   The object was very low to the ground, about 20-50 feet above the trees, and was traveling very slowly in a northeast direction it looked as if it were hovering.   My initial thoughts were that it was an aircraft flying extremely low to ground, or 3 separate helicopters, but I did not hear any noise, and as I drove closer realized that it wasn’t either a commercial airliner or 3 helicopters flying in unison.   The object was pitch black and I could not see the trees or sky behind/above it.   I continued to drive, and as I drove closer, the road curved and after about 10-20 seconds, the object was no longer in view.   When I completed the curve in the road, I could no longer see the object.  It was just gone.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351

Also, i thought they were too far apart to be an airplane.   A bright red flashing light was following them about 1-2 miles behind.  Just thought it was very odd, because if it were a plane, its by far the biggest plane I've ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Three red-orange lights in triangular formation hovering over apartments.;2019-04-11 21:15:00;2 minutes;Three red-orange lights in triangular formation hovering over apartments. We pulled into the parking lot of our apartment complex, and started unloading the trunk.   My fiancé told me to turn around and look behind me in the sky.  I immediately put my bags down and just watched in awe.  Right above the tree line there were three giant red-orange glowing lights.  They never pulsated.  They were in a triangular shape.  It hovered there for a bit, then I realized I needed to record it.  By the time I got my phone out it had raised a little in the sky and seemed less big.  It still hovered, but also rotated slightly.  We watched as one by one each light eventually went out.  We agreed that the weirdest thing was never actually seeing a shape.  When the lights went out, there was literally nothing there.  It was night time, but we could still see the sky and clouds.  It was as if there was a craft that was invisible except for the lights.  Immediately after the ufo disappeared, two helicopters came from two different directions.  I went inside shortly afterward.  There was never any sound to the ufo.  I have clear video of the sighting.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
Bright lights 60 feet above ground near abandoned improved assisted living facility;2019-05-15 02:00:00;15 minutes;Bright lights 60 feet above ground near abandoned improved assisted living facility Hi –  Ok – I personally know the person who posted the 2/21/18 report from San Antonio.  I admit that when the original poster shared her sightings with me, my analytical mind started looking for ways to “explain” away her reports.  However, I do trust the original poster. Several months after the 2/21/18 poster shared her sightings with me, I woke up at about 2 a.m.  I live directly below the original poster.  While laying on the couch, I could see out my blinds across the abandoned yet improved adjacent property.  I could see through the blinds three very bright lights . . . in close formation.  The lights appeared to change in colors and I do recall a red light and a very bright cold blue light.  I know I saw what I saw – I even got up off my couch and walked out onto my balcony.  The lights/device/thing was probably 100 yards away – to the North – and appeared to be about treetop height – approximately 60 feet in the air.  I kept staring at whatever it was.  With a few exceptions, it remained stationary.  My initial thought was “drone.”  My second thought was “drone flown by some pervert trying to look into our apartment windows.”  But it was all too weird. Look – I have a graduate degree.  I’m 48 years old.  I love science.  I consider myself pretty sharp and definitely not hysterical.  I dig on the scientific method and I get that the simplest explanation is often the correct one.  But . . . based on operational logistics and the location of the observation, something was strange and inexplicable.  I saw what I saw – it got my chalupa eating hiney off the couch and onto the patio for a better view.  It was too large to be a drone.  Plus – why at 2 a.m.  . . . over a very abandoned but secure retirement community???  If someone were flying a drone, they would “fly it” . . . as in it should move . . . instead it hovered for like 15 minutes til it simply disappeared with no change in elevation. Very strange. I would be interested to know whether my location was the same as an earlier poster above from April 2019 who reported seeing an object while with her fiancée.  I wonder if that occurred in the same area/location. I saw what I saw.  I was intrigued enough to go outside for a better look.  My upstairs neighbor has seen similar objects.  Weird.;29.5016864410568;-98.5113645942351
