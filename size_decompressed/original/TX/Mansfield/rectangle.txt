3 Unknown Aircrafts 2 VERY large 1 small one.;2012-09-28 19:30:00;10 minutes;3 Unknown Aircrafts 2 VERY large 1 small one 7:30 p.m. Mansfield, Texas Friday, September 28, 2012   I am highly educated and I am 45 years of age. My son and I were driving to Roadhouse to pick up something for dinner we were about to turn right on to Country Club we were sitting at the stop sign by Boren Elementary School and my son blurted out, What is that?” (He is 15)…  To our right in the sky line, not too far up was a sight I had never seen before…. Something really large with many vertical and horizontal white lights was flying slowly….  As it turned, we noticed that one side had many lights and the other side did not.  If you live in a flight zone, which we do, (this was not in the flight zone) you see planes flying over relatively low).  That aircraft was flying even lower than that?  We could not hear any sound coming from the craft.  When I saw it, I immediately rolled down my window…. It made a sharp turn and began to move towards the East, towards Matlock Drive, so we pursued.. It did not turn like a commercial aircraft would, moving in a slow bank, it just turned on a dime and began moving in the other direction..  It continued toward the East so we pulled over in an area where we could continue watching.  It was then that we saw something unbelievable!   As the object continued moving away from us but still very visible, one of the lights on the aircraft shot straight up into the air, which turned out to be a smaller aircraft.  It was much smaller of course and it began to circle around in a large circle around the larger aircraft that it took off from.  As it was following the larger aircraft, the next unbelievable thing happened.  Another very large aircraft just like the first one we saw, appeared in the same airspace as the other two, coming from the Northwest and it caught up with the other two flying objects 2 very large objects and one small one.  They all 3 continued flying to the East..  This morning, Saturday, September 29, 2012, I googled UFO sightings for Mansfield,  Texas and there is a video that interestingly dates September 29, 2010.  The object in this video looks very similar to the one we saw on the 28th, 2012, but the one we saw was much lower in flight..;32.5817;-97.1398999999999
