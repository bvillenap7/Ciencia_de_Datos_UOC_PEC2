Driving home this weird light was trippy.;2004-03-15 02:45:00;10 Minutes;Driving home this weird light was trippy. I was driving around 2:45 - 3:15 A.M, and to the front left of me there was a light that would remind you of a star, and at what i'd describe as 1/4 the size of a full moon. I had just dropped off a friend and I called him and told him where in the sky it would be from his house. He said that he saw it but it looked very small from where he was, as i was heading in the direction it was in. The light seemed to move across the sky as i looked at it, but as odd as it sounds, i couldnt quite tell what direction it was moving in. The light seemed to hover and move vertical down slowly then back up. I faintly remember the light fading from its normal white to a sort of red and back again. I came to a parking lot of a resteraunt and pulled over and got out and called my dad for some reason to tell him about it. The light seemed to move inward almost directly in line towards my head, as if coming directly at me. It did this for a few seconds and then moved directly outward from me untill it dissapeared in the sky and i couldnt see it anymore from it moving further and further away.

5 lights moving in the sky;2004-06-21 23:30:00;5 minutes;5 lights moving in the sky At first we noticed lights on the horizon darting up and down, they disapeared and were replaced with a red light that moved slowly down out of the sky towards the house we were standing outside.  The light then hovered and I noticed a brighter white light in the middle of the red light.  It then moved slowly over the house about 200 feet up and went out over the trees.  We then noticed three additional lights hovering above some trees in the front yard about 50 yards out and 2 or 300 feet up.;32.5817;-97.1398999999999

Orbital object in the sky hovering over Hwy 360 south of Hwy I-20 remaining stationary. There are lights illuminating from the object;2016-10-16 21:31:00;30 minutes;Orbital object in the sky hovering over Hwy 360 south of Hwy I-20 remaining stationary. There are lights illuminating from the object flickering red, green and white.  No engine or rotor blade sounds coming from the object.  Two commercial airline/aircraft have flown in close proximity of the object. Unfortunately, the object is too far to photograph by my cell phone due to the darkness.  The object is seen through a range finder monocular that is unable to take photos.  Just reporting in case others come upon the same object.
