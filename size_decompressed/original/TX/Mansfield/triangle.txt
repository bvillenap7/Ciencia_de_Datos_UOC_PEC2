white 500 foot wide V shape craft flys over Mansfield, Texas at night;2013-10-24 22:45:00;5 seconds;white 500 foot wide V shape craft flys over Mansfield, Texas at night I looked up and saw this huge 500 foot wide white V shape craft moving very fast to the south. It was so fast i couldnt film it since i was not anticipating seeing a ufo tonight :)  No lights, it must have been white.  it was very light colored against the night sky but not illuminated.  it looked like a giant bird (i thought it was a strand or flock of birds at first, but the shape moved in perfect unison) or a massive hang glider and was out of sight in 5 seconds.  It flew directly over my house heading south.;32.5817;-97.1398999999999
