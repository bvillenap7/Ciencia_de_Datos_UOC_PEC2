Loud booms heard in early morning, possible ufo being loaded onto flatbed truck.;2009-08-08 00:30:00;60 seconds;Loud booms heard in early morning, possible ufo being loaded onto flatbed truck. I live in Fort Worth, Texas.  My nephew-in-law who lives in Mansfield heard some very loud booms near his house around 12:30 am and went out to investigate but found nothing.  His brother-in-law and two other people in the neighborhood also heard them.  In checking the web I found a forum for Kennedale on topix.  There were many people who heard the noises and several reports of sparks over the treetops, and several people who claimed they had seen a flatbed truck being loaded with a ufo on Highway 287.  There were two (supposed) pictures posted of this on Twitter.  There were also claims that several black suvs were at the scene and the men were directing the local tv channel 5 news crew not to film and to leave the scene.  There has been nothing reported on the local news.;32.5817;-97.1398999999999
