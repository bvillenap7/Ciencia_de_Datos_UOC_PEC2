My wife and I were sitting outside in the back yard like we do any other night.  We were facing northeast when we saw a flame appear out of nowhere.  At first it looked as if there was a fire in the sky.  Both of us saw the object for about two and a half minutes. 	The object formed into a circle like shape with a bright orange, reddish color around it with a black hole formed in the middle of it.  Then it flew north toward downtown Fort Worth, Texas.   My wife and I watched the object until the naked eye couldnâ€™t see it anymore.;32.5817;-97.1398999999999
