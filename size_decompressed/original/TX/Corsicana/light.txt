Green and White lights spotted near Corsicana, Texas fall from the sky north of 287 East of I-45.;2008-05-11 22:30:00;5 seconds;Green and White lights spotted near Corsicana, Texas fall from the sky north of 287 East of I-45. My wife and I were driving home 5/11/08 at 10:30 pm on Interstate 45 North just crossing 287 in Corsicana, Texas and we both were startled to see something that appeared as a falling star approaching the ground. It was traveling at and incredible rate of speed and the only reason I didn’t think it was an asteroid or something like it, was it had one green and one white light on it. I did not see a tail of burning dust like a falling star usually has. My wife corrects me and tells me that there was a red burning tail to it. It hit the ground approximately one mile North of State highway 287 and about 4 miles East of Interstate 45. I did not hear a crash, but I did see the sky light up momentarily. It didn’t last but about 2 to 5 seconds. I didn’t see any emergency vehicles anywhere. I didn’t read about it in the papers or the Internet. I was wondering if anyone else saw this and what it was. Thank you.;32.0725;-96.4615185185185
