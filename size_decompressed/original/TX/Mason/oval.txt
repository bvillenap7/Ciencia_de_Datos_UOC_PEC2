While my brother was driving north on U.S. Route 87 I noticed a light ship above the road.  I said look there is a ship.  He looked up and saw it.  It was very shiny like aluminum.  After 10 seconds it disappeared or cloaked.  It could have been very large depending  how far away it was?;30.7448;-99.2218
