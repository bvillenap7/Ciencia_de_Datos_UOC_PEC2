Light quickly shot across the sky and stopped.;2018-08-19 20:55:00;<1 minute;light quickly shot across the sky and stopped i was sitting outside on my front deck (faces to the south) looking at the stars and i thought i saw a flash in the southeastern sky, near the lower left side of the moon.  i kept staring in the same area to see if i would see it again when i saw a star near the right lower side of the moon start to move.  it moved very quickly from the south east to the north east in my view and then stopped.  there was no noise, no trail.  i went inside the house to get my cell phone and when i got back outside, i did not see any further movement.;29.2665;-97.6184
