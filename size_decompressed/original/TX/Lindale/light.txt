The media reported a fireball going across the sky that night.  I was sitting in the house at the computer. The back window is to my right, facing due East. I heard something that sounded like a bee. That's what caught my attention. I looked out and saw a spotlight or searchlight shining down on top of the trees about 1/2 mile or so away. It was moving slowly North. There were no markers, or anti-collision lights. I have been an aircraft mechanic for 15 years, and I know an aircraft when I see one. I am also a ham radio operator, and have a ladder propped against the front of my house, so I can get to my antennae. I ran out the front door and climbed to the top of the house to get a better look, but it was gone. It was moving kind of slow, and I thought it was a blimp. It would be real strange to see a blimp at night - especially with no markers on it.  I have heard that giant bee sound a time or two since, but I didn't see a searchlight. It always occurs at night.
