As I was working in my garage, my son called me to look and see what was outside in the sky.  I dismissed his request, and continued to work.  He called for me again, and he pointed to the sky where I saw what appeared to be a fireball on the end of a rope.  As it fell closer to the house, I began to back up for fear it was going to fall onto our driveway.  Then I got a glimpse of what it really was.  It was a boomerang shaped craft with an exhaust/light coming out of one end.  It appeared to be in trouble.  It appeared to be free falling until the light/flame on the opposite side of the craft re-engaged.  It stopped falling, and resumed it's altitude.  At that point it moved very quickly to the left, then it propelled itself forward and was out of sight in a matter of seconds.  It was faster than any object I had ever witnessed.  I saw the craft and it seemed to be clear or mirror-colored, that is that it looked like it was covered with a mirror like finish which made it look camoflauged.  After it left, I immeadiately went back inside with my son and asked him to draw what he had seen, as I drew what I saw.  He is only four, but our pictures matched.;32.5055;-95.4031
