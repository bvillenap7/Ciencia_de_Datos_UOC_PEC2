I know others saw the same thing, they were all pointing I was driving home from work on HWY 181 when there was a bright light that just kind of appeared with a small light trailing it.  It was coming south towards traffic for about 15 seconds maybe, the height was about 2 telephone poles high.  As it came closer it shot due west, after turning west you could see it for maybe 5 seconds and then it was gone.  I know other drivers saw it because they were all pointing at the sky in the same area i saw it. I think i am a really rational person, however i could not explain what i saw, i know it was not an airplane or helicopter. I know i saw something.
