This bright red thing hovered as it descended to the ground and disappeared lasted a good 40 seconds before it vanished into the ground.   My snapshot showes a metallic looking sac with 3 metallic balls in it to the far right of the photo. This is not a flare ..not a firework not smoke and not a helicopter ,,, we ruled out Ll those explanations...  Call me crazy but it was scary and real..;27.8939;-97.3162999999995
