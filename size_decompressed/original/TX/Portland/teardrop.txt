It was a night that no stars were in sight.  There were two teardroped shaped crafts.  There was a pink light coming from the base of the teardrop.  It was the scariest thing I've ever seen.  It looked like they stopped for a second then they flashed out of sight in about 2 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.
