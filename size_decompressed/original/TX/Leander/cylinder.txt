Day time UFO in Leander-TX seen by 5..;1998-01-24 15:20:00;20 minutes;Day time UFO in Leander-TX seen by 5.. My brother called me to the backyard. Wife,son, and daughter arrived. We observed the object moving in a northern direction. It was a metallic cylinder object, 100 - 150 feet tall, that stayed vertical without any rotation such as would occur if any part was, or acted as, an axis. Was observed through binoculars. It traveled at a constant speed, which was slow enough that when we followed it, we stayed with it easily without breaking the speed limit. We followed it on US Hwy 183 heading north to 2243 E. We then traveled on 2243 E. and pulled off the road. It passed over us. We used binoculars to again observe it. We then commenced east again intending to go to IH 35 and intercept it again. A dark helicopter was observed flying from the south at a high speed and at an altitude of about 500 feet (unknown if involved in incident). A small, low flying Cessna Skyhawk 150 was making signals to possibly a ground crew (not believed involved in incident). A jet fighter using afterburners was heading southwest at possibly 20,000 (unknown if involved). No military base close. We traveled to IH 35 and looked about but found nothing. We traveled west on Hwy 29. Observed (3) jet aircraft that appeared to be going vertical in v formation, in a flight path that would intercept the object, had it continued in the same direction of travel last seen by us.

Lit up like a shooting star at first then round dim intermittently illuminated red craft moving West to East in a zig zag pattern.;2019-06-12 22:30:00;10 minutes;Lit up like a shooting star at first then round dim intermittently illuminated red craft moving West to East in a zig zag pattern. I was stargazing one night from my backyard patio.  Dim orange/red intermittent illumination round object traveling across the sky from West to East.  No navigation lights as planes I did notice transiting that night so I ruled out the possibility of the sighting being an airplane.  It was noticed first as what I thought was a shooting star in my peripheral vision but it never burned out but got dim and traveled in a zig zag pattern across the sky.  I tried to track it with my eyes until it suddenly disappeared.;30.5671836405528;-97.8698617511517
