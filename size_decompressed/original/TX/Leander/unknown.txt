On Friday, June 24, 2011, at approximately 2:15/2:20 AM, I was awaken by a loud humming vibrating sound.  Since I wear a CPAP machine at night I thought the machine was finally going out om completely.   I got out of bed and noticed that after turning the machine offf I could still hear and feel the humming, vibrating sound.  My wife who had slept in the living room with the tv on I went and woke her up thinking that it was the tv, but I could hear the sound much louder in the living room.   I turned and looked toward the back door which has a glass on it and a paper thin door blind all the way down.  I could see a pulsing red light between the edge of the blind and the glass door.   I immediately went out to the backporch without turning my outside spotlights.  To the left side of our property is a big stonewall and the state is building the new 183A Toll Road.  To the back and south of the property is a wooded creek.  I thought that the road crew was working late again because they have worked on weekends before.   As I stepped out to the porch and to my left I saw some type of craft.  It had to be a flying craft but I was unable to see what type of design it was because to the back of the craft were three (3) large in sequence pulsating lights lights.  The light were in sequence from left to right.  The red lights eminating from the flying craft were very bright and big and I was unable to distinguish the the type of craft.   The craft was flying south just above treetop level and approximately 45/50 miles and hour.  I spent 20 years in the Air Force and I know no aircraft in the Air Force had huge red pulsating lights on the back like the ones I saw.  I'm also retired from the police department.   The object disappeared behind the trees still going southbound on highway 183A toward Austin, Texas.  Other people had to have seen something because light traffic was traveling in both directions at the time.;30.5671836405528;-97.8698617511517
Dot with flashing light, high in the sky, seen on a clear afternoon.;2020-08-22 16:45:00;1 minutes;Dot with flashing light, high in the sky, seen on a clear afternoon. A clear day's afternoon I was sitting in the back yard and looked up at the sky.  I saw a dot with a flashing light tracing an irregular trajectory that seemed to come out from behind a small cloud.  The only cloud in the area at the time. It was a black dot high in the sky.  The bright light flashed at 1 sec intervals.  It moved in the 9 o'clock direction and turned 90 deg to the 6 o'clock not very far from the cloud.  I reached for my cell to set the camera and when I looked up again, it had disappeared and also the small cloud.  I wonder if anyone in the vicinity has reported this sighting.;30.5671836405528;-97.8698617511517
