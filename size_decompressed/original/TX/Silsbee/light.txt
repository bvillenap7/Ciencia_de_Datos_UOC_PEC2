They seen it moving slowly then it stoped.  It was pretty low. I went outside and it was so bright that was the first thing that caught my eye.   I called my brother-in-law and told him to go outside.  He lives about 2 miles away. He went and seen the same thing.  I went back inside for about 15 min. and then went back outside and it was gone.  I called my husband but where they were at they couldn't tell anything.  So I called my brother-in-law and told him to go back outside and see if he sees it.  His response was No    It was like it just disappered.  It was so bright and low not way up in the sky.  It was also nighttime.;30.3221999999999;-94.1913000000002
