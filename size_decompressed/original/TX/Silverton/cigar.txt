The object was cigar shaped with a silver color, it stayed in one position for about 10minutes did not hear any planes or helicoptors it was silent, and below it a about 10 yards away was a house, there was only one of them. above it were alot of clouds as i looked at it for 10minutes all of a sudden it went straight up into the clouds, i just got in my car trying to follow it, but by the time i got half way down the road there was a split in the clouds and i saw it again, but as as far as it was i swear it was going at lest 200 or more m.p.h. It's hard to get my friends to beleive me but i know what saw, i beleived in u.f.o's but after seeing that, I beleive even more.  And behind me were some fields, this happened in the country. I will never ever forget that day. Sincerly, ((name deleted));34.465;-101.3169
