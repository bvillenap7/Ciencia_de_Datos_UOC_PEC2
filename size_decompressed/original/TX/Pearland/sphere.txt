I don't know what it was, but it made such an impact on me that I am now searching for other witnesses to discuss what they saw as well. The object also had a glow.   I'm no UFO fantatic, but am very curious to what others saw in the Houston/Pearland area.  Beltway 8 & 288.;29.5490697247706;-95.3075486238533
Round object in the sky with blue,green, and red colors hovering in the southeastern sky;2010-10-20 02:59:00;2 houra;Round object in the sky with blue, green, and red colors hovering in the southeastern sky The object was a spherical shape with very flashy and bright colors.  It just kept hovering for a very long time.  Then it seemed to have taken off then reappeared.  The lights looked to be spinning but it might have been an illusion since the lights were blinking.   Also it seemed that some lights were not flashing causing a cross to be made in the object.  And at times it would have two parallel lines on it following the shape of sphere.;29.5490697247706;-95.3075486238533
An intensive white light flash on residential road, non UFO or trajectory.;2014-12-27 19:45:00;3 seconds;An intensive white light flash on residential road, non UFO or trajectory This is NOT a UFO sighting, but an intensive light flash  December 27, 2014 Saturday evening 7:50PM  Location:  Southfolk Drive, 2 miles east of Hwy 288, near the junction of County Road 90, Pearland, TX  Weather: cloudy after rain, 51F, 89% humidity  Ambient Condition: evening, dark, street lights on 2 lane one-way road (there were 2 other lanes for the opposite traffic, divider in the middle with small trees).  Residential neighborhood, houses on both sides, 30 miles/hour speed limit.  Light traffic (estimated about 5-7 cars driving behind my vehicle). Event Observation:  While driving back home through the residential neighborhood, there was an intense white light bursting into scene.  It happened by my vehicle’s immediate right, located near the lane divider, about spherical, diameter about 20 feet, height about 15 feet from the ground.  It lasted about 2-3 sec.   My vehicle drove right through it.  There was no sound, no smoke, no smell, no other phenomenon except the intense white light itself.  It appeared as a camera flash light, but magnified about 1 million times in size and intensity.   The street lights about 1 mile in radius went off (because the street lights have auto-light sensor and come on-off by themselves).  Then after about 2-3 minutes, they came back normal again.  The traffic light which was about 50 feet away from the spot was not affected.  The street lights came back none damaged.  None of the cars or other objects was damaged. Personal Experience:  I came back after a long meditation session and a bad day with family conflict.  My mind was very negative and dark, full of recursive heavy thoughts.  It was bitterly complaining about the meditation center and rumbling about it.  The exact thought while I was witnessing this event was, “These 2 spiritual experiences can be dangerous, people need to be careful about joining spiritual centers, they will brain wash you” (the 2 meant my previous Buddhist meditation center and the present one). I have been practicing meditation for a while and keenly aware of my inner state. Then the light came on, completely shocking to the minimal.  My 1st reaction was it felt like the street light above the vehicle (which is the modern yellow glowing high voltage powered one) or the high-voltage power line exploded.  It happened so fast that my car drove right through the light.  I had the aftermath wondering that how come my car did not get melted by it and I was still alive (I nearly felt my car would be exploded with it too).  The car behind me also drove right through, along with several other vehicles.  This made me feel safe that I was not hallucinating or hurt by anything, and my mind became very clear and calm. All the negative thoughts suddenly stopped and vanished.  I felt like being changed to my normal state again. Meanwhile, all street lights completed shut down.  Driving further 50 feet, I stopped by the traffic light which was red at that moment, and appeared to be very lonely in the complete darkness (a very interesting ethereal feeling).  I turned right as the way of going home, noticing the entire street lights on this road were also shut off.  After driving a further 50 feet on this road, the lights started to come back again.  I was very puzzled exactly what happened, and thought maybe something malfunctioned with the power line or street lights. I thought I need to call the city and it would be unsafe for people driving through the dark roads.  I took a U-turn through my house and drove back to the event location – this was about 5 minutes after.  Everything went back to normal, as if nothing had ever happened. There was no trace left whatsoever, except my mind was wondering about exactly what this was about.  Afterwards, a very close friend came unexpected and immediately when I got home, keeping me engaged busily for 2 hours before I went to bed.  The next morning when I recollected about this experience, it felt even more strange.  So I decided to file this report to see if other people have reported it or other similar events.;29.5490697247706;-95.3075486238533
