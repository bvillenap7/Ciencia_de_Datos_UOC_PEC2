On the morning of Saturday December 10, 2016, at 07:12 AM, my wifeâ€™s phone received an alert that the living room security camera had pick up motion.  We were still in the bedroom.  My wife and I are the only people living in the home, so I assume our dog must have set it off.  ((dog's name deleted)) (the dog) is gated off from the living room, but I thought we might have left the gate open inadvertently. I checked the event recordings and saw a white round something come under the front door, fly in a non straight line through the living room and past the camera.  I do not know what it was.  The dog gate was closed, doors locked and deadbolted. I have saved the video of the event.;29.5490697247706;-95.3075486238533
