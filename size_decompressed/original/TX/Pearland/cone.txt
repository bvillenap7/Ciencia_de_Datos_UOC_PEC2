One red craft appeared maybe a couple hundred feet off the ground above the highway, traveling east, right in front of me as I was driving.  I didn't see it until it was directly in front of me.   At first, I thought it might be a helicopter.  But it had no blades on top.  Then I thought maybe a missile because it was an elongated shape with a sharp point at the front, like a mosquito.   But it had a complicated set of tail rudders, which I don't think is common of missiles.  And it had a glass like enclosure, like seen on fighter jets, so someone or something was definitely flying it.   It disappeared behind the trees for a split second, and when I saw it again it had a pair of wings.  Disappeared behind some trees for a second then never reappeared.  The most distinctive features were the needle-nose front end and the overly-complex wings and tail rudders.  They had extra bars, flaps, etc. everywhere.;29.5490697247706;-95.3075486238533
