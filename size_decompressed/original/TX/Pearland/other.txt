Too fast to be a standard passenger airplane.  Had to have been military (if it was of this planet).   But did not make any jet/plane noises.

Very bright red light in the middle of nowhere.;2015-06-26 03:28:00;5 mins;Very bright red light in the middle of nowhere. I was out at work on 06/26/15 when something told me to look up.  I'm a Security officer and always on the graveyard shift.  So anyways, I looked up.  I saw a very bright red light, in the middle of nowhere.  I even took 3 pictures of it.  None of the pictures are perfectly clear however.   I do my rounds every hour.  I went out at 3:25 am to check the area.  That's when I saw this thing.  So I keep my eye on it for roughly 4 mins.  Then my phone rang.  It was my sergeant calling, so I answer and look back up but it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
