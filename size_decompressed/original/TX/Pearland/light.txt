Bright red, yellow and white round light, hazy, long yellow tail, high rate of speed, observed by Police Officer, S of Houston, TX..;2014-07-12 21:05:00;5-8 seconds;Bright red, yellow and white round light, hazy, long yellow tail, high rate of speed, observed by Police Officer, S of Houston, TX.. Date: 07/12/2014 Time:2105 hrs Duration: 5-8 seconds Sighting city: Pearland Sighting state: Texas Zip: 77581 County: Brazoria County Witness: 1 Shape: Round and hazy, possibly a cluster. Number: 1 or 3 grouped together. Description: Round, hazy, red, white and yellow, bright lights with a long tail, extremely high rate of speed. I reside in a suburb located about 20 miles south of Houston, Texas.  There is quite a bit of light pollution in my area, coming from Houston to the north, and a small baseball field to the east, so star gazing is minimal.  There is a small, private airport, about 3/4 mile SW of my location.  Approximately 5 miles NE is Ellington Field, a former AFB, and still a current NASA facility.  My neighborhood is full of trees, which partially obscured my vision of what I have just seen. At 2105 hrs, I was in my front yard, speaking with a family member on my phone, facing north.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement in the sky, and turned to see what it was.   I observed a multi-colored, red, yellow and white, brightly lit object, moving at a ridiculously high rate of speed, coming from the SE, and traveling almost due NW, or right to left for me.  This object had a long tail, similar to a comet or shooting star, that was a sort of a fuzzy, faint yellow.  The lights were not blinking, bright, yet hazy, like it was surrounded by part of the front part of the tail..   The angle of elevation was somewhere between 45 and 60 degrees.  I couldn’t say if this object was at 35,000 feet, or skimming the treetops of the houses across the street.   When I first saw the object, it was NE from my house, and as I was trying to tell my family member what I had just seen, and running out into the street to get a better look, the object continued on its NW course, dis! appearing over the horizon.   This object was in my view for a very short time, somewhere between 5 and 8 seconds.   From my perspective, this object appeared to be about the size of a basketball.   There was no noise coming from the object, but every dog in the neighborhood was  barking or howling at something that I couldn’t hear. I am an active, 25 year Police Officer, and have never seen anything so strange, or move so fast.  I am not one to believe in alien spacecraft, much less report on one, but what I saw doesn’t compute with anything I know, and I would really like to know what the hell I just saw..;29.5490697247706;-95.3075486238533
