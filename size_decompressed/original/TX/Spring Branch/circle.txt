Glowing round light captured on phone 3 times.  It seemed to brighten & glow.  Moving but not leaving area as if it was just above tree line facing south of where video taped but long ways away.  First I thought it was star and I guess it could be but I’ve never seen star so low and moving.  Very odd what we saw and no one could tell what it was.  After viewing for 25-30 min I went inside.  I came back out 30 min later and some cloud cover had showed but not enough to cover moon or other stars in the sky.  It  was then gone from sight.  This object was below moon and to the right when we filmed but you could not see both in video.  Not sure what it was and that’s why I reported.  I’ve never seen this website until I google searched to see if anything else came up about glowing and moving light in the sky tonight.;29.926;-98.3822
