Most likely a meteorite with some copper in it's composition. I will call the object a meteorite. It first had a thin yellowish trial for the first second or so.  The trail then brightened or widened and emitted the green coloration in the last half of the observation arc before fading out. Observation angle aproximation 40deg.to 20deg. above horizon looking West.  The sky was clear and dark.  I did not notice any moonlight.  My location: 29.32.7N by 98.38.9W by map interpolation. The object did not deviate from a straight line path.;29.926;-98.3822
