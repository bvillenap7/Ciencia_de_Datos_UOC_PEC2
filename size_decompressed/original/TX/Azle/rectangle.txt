I asked him what was he doing and he said What is that?  What is WHAT? I asked him. I couldnt see anything. Then it went over to my side of the car I saw it at the same time my 12 year old did in the back seat. I said I don't know what that is. He got excited and said See Mom, I told you they exist! Just over the tree line right over our van, there was a dark rectangular shaped craft covered in round gold lights on the underside, a orange fringe of what must have been exhaust of some kind, and a revolving light in the front. Only 2 light flashed the rest remained on. It traveled with us for a minute at about 40 miles per hour. Then, it went up and I could see that there were no wings and there was no sound of any kind. It was completely silent. It came back to tree level and picked up speed and seemed to gide down the street abovethe trees until it was out of sigt over Eagle Mountain Lake. I am in shock. I always said I would never believe it until I see it. I don't know what to think now!;32.9074;-97.5321999999999
