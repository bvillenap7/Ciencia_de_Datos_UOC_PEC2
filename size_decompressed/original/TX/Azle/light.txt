Amber Light Vanishing;2001-06-12 03:00:00;2 seconds;Amber Light Vanishing I went outside to observe the night sky and after a couple of minutes had wandered up to the end of my driveway near our mailbox.  Then, I looked straight up and observed a single dark yellow, amberish light directly overhead drifting slowly toward the north I was facing south.  The light was no bigger than that on an airplane, and would have been at least that high up, however, as soon as I sighted it, it faded away.  The duration of the event could not have been more than two seconds between the time I spotted it and the time it vanished, but it _was_ moving visibly northward.;32.9074;-97.5321999999999
box kite shaped with cylinder center connecting the two ends;2006-05-20 22:00:00;9 seconds;box kite shaped with cylinder center connecting the two ends My wife and I had neighbors visiting 05/21/06 appox 10:00 PM.on our front porch.The neighbors son 7yrs old said look a satilite is falling! We all looked up into the star lite sky and seen something very strange, it was moving faster than any aircraft from south to north it was shaped like a box kite, with two squares at each end with a cylinder conneting in the middle. The object had no sound and two diffused lights one light was on the upper box and the other light was on the lower box. It took about 9 seconds to travel all the way across the sky, faster than any of us had ever seen. About 5 minutes later two navel jets flew past in the same direction as the object we had seen.  I came in and called 911 to report the object.  The dispatcher said that she had received a few other calls on this.  The next morning we contacted nbc5 news to see if anyone had reported anything over the north Texas sky.  The lady took my wifes name and number but said nothing had been reported.  I than contacted Alliance airport tower, they gave me the number to the Joint Reserve Naval Air Base approximatly 10 miles from us.   The Reserve Base tower checked their logs from the previous night but would not give me any information but offered to take a report from me which I did.  They said they would get back with me in 3 to 4 days.;32.9074;-97.5321999999999
