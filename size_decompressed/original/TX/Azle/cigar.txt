My son saw something just above the car on the passenger side and asked me what it was. I could not see it until at that moment, it passed over the car to my side just above the tree line about 50 feet above the car. I had never seen anything like it in my life. It was a UFO that was cigar or rectangle shaped, bigger than a tour bus, dark gray colored, covered in round gold lights on the bottom, (10-12 lights)and had a bright orange comet tail on the end. The lights were like balls of sunshine floating in clear spheres of liquid. It was silent. No sound at all even though it was right over us. It traveled alongside of us for about 30 seconds at 40 mph, went up in the sky several thousand feet in a fraction of a second and came back to tree level just ahead of us and glided down the road toward the lake at fast pace until it disappeared. We were all in shock. My son in the back seat said that I could no longer deny the existence of UFOs. He was so excited at that moment because he has always wanted to see one.I have never believed in them before I saw it for myself. I have not slept well since and cannot stop thinking about it.;32.9074;-97.5321999999999
Orange cigar shaped craft chased down a backroad.;2013-08-22 21:11:00;3 minutes;Orange cigar shaped craft chased down a backroad. I was driving home from work when something strange caught my eye. All I could see at first was a mysterious orange light through the trees.   I chased the craft for about a mile until I came to an open gravel lot and got a full view of the craft.  It was a light orange color and moved very slowly across the sky until disappearing.;32.9074;-97.5321999999999
