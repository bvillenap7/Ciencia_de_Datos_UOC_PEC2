Intresting, strange, and something not from the planet earth.;2008-10-28 02:16:00;2 Minutes;Intresting, strange, and something not from the planet earth. It was 2:16 AM. I was driving west towards downtown Azle on Highway 199 A.K.A Jacksboro Highway. I was looking to the left out of my driver-side window. About 2 Miles away, there was a giant gold glowing object. I could tell it wasn't a oil rig, nor gas rig. The object never moved. It wasn't on the ground or supported by any other object. The object was all one piece. At the top it appeared to be an elaborate antenna of some kind. Below the antenna, was a saucer/square shape. Below the saucer/square portion of the object was about 3 to 5 more antenna-like objects. I estimated the object to be anywhere from 250 feet to 300 foot tall. Let I remind you that it was one whole piece. I didn't stop to get a closer look, nor had a camera of any kind. I drive on that part of the highway at least once everyday, and at least once every night. My car radio's frequency was fuzzy at the time. I looked at my cell phone at that time as well, and had no service. In the same area, their are 2 cell phone service Antenna's about 3 to 5 miles apart from each other. When I made my way back to that area, I looked in the same location the object was in, and it was gone. This was about a 10 minutes after seeing the object, and returning from downtown Azle. This is the best description I can give you.;32.9074;-97.5321999999999
