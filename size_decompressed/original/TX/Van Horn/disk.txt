I was listening to the CB when all of a sudden everyone going East bound Starteded to say what is that. I could nmot get a good look so I woke my husband who looked out the mirror he said it looked just like a disk that you hear about when you think of UFO'S I t had blue and white lights and was moving back and forth.  The white lights were like the color of a stobe light very white and bright. he estimates it was between 1000 & 1500 ft off the ground. It was very clear out and you could make out the shape from all the lights blinking I would say there were at least 8 to 10 lights.  Everyone noticed and noone could figure out what it was it was still ther when i left.;31.0421;-104.8213
