Blue Sphere of Light - Turns into Upside Down Pyramid of Light;1995-11-01 22:30:00;2 seconds;Blue Sphere of Light - Turns into Upside Down Pyramid of Light I was standing in the alley behind the garage when I observed a large, sky blue, sphere in the southeastern sky.  The sphere appeared out of nowhere and was moving at a high rate of speed.  It suddenly stopped - I could not tell the size of the sphere because it had to have been at least 50 miles away - hovered for less than half a second and then shot straight into the ground.  At the very instant that it made contact with the ground a brilliant upside down pyramid of light - the same color as the sphere - shown into the sky.  The light coming from the ground or impact was gone in a flash.  There was no sound associated with this event. I looked around hoping to see that someone else had witnessed this event, checked the newspaper the next day for a report and also tried to phone the local UFO hotline (it was not a working number).  I had never seen anything of this nature before and have not seen a similar object since.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
BRIGHT LIGHT FALLING FAST TOWARDS THE GROUND;2005-12-27 22:40:00;2-3 sec.;BRIGHT LIGHT FALLING FAST TOWARDS THE GROUND My husband and I were leaving from a movie when we both saw a BRIGHT spherical object appear in the sky and drop down very quickly.  It looked almost white to me and a blueish color to my husband.  We both said, Did you see that? at the exact same time.  It was moving much faster than an aircraft would.  I was waiting for a large explosion or sound upon impact but we never saw anything like that.  It just seemed to disappear.  I really thought it had to be an aircraft crashing to the ground but it was just too large and bright.  My husband and I have seen a meteor shower up close and it was nothing like that.  Not a shooting star.  We are puzzled as to what it could have been.  I looked everywhere to see if others had reported it.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335

Yellow sphere observed by two people sitting still and then moving around before leaving;2013-07-13 23:00:00;5 minutes;yellow sphere observed by two people sitting still and then moving around before leaving While driving home from dinner at my parents house, my wife and I noticed a round oval looking craft in the sky that was mostly a yellow color (similar to a street light yellow) with little bright white lights around what looked like the center of the craft.  I thought that it was moving very slowly to be a plane and was way to high to be a helicopter.   I told my wife to pull the car over so I could see if the object was moving or not.  When she stopped the object was in fact not moving at all, it then started to move backwards and forwards for a few seconds and then stopped again.   After maybe a minute the craft started moving to what I believe would be its port side, assuming that the craft was facing towards our position, and moved just a little and then it seemed to jump forwards in the same direction it was heading and then stopped for a second and then took off.  It looked like something you would see in a sci-fi movie where it went into warp speed or something.   We watched for a few more minutes and did not see anything else in the sky other than the starts that were there.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335

REPORT DATE:  06-27-16 EVENT   DATE AND TIME:  APX FIRST WEEK IN MAY OF 2016 SOMEWHERE  BETWEEN 1 P.M. – 4 P.M. EVENT LOCATION:  PLANO, TX   I was watching the roof crew put on a new roof on a 2 story house.  It was an absolute clear bright blue day.  From the field of view, approximately 2 – 3” above the house view in the clear blue sky was a bright white star, so bright it was shaped like a cross.  Then it went up, turned into a silver ball with a flat bottom, then vanished.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
Small white dot in the sky.;2020-09-06 15:00:00;Brief;Small white dot in the sky. Sitting in the pool, I looked up and saw a tiny round white dot that I thought was a planet, I looked down and looked back up a minute later and it was still there.  It never moved it was stationary.  I turned to get my boyfriend's attention to show him and when I motioned to where it was, it was gone.  I did not see it go, it was there one moment and gone the next.  Did not see anything else after that.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
