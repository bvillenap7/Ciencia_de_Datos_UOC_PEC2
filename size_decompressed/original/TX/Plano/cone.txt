No one but me saw them on a bus going west on 190. I was riding Dart bus on 190 taking 75 exit to go south to Dallas on Central Expressway when I saw a formation of grey cones that were still in a circle over city hall on Avenue K.  No one on the bus saw them when I said out loud look at the cones in the sky over Plano.   When the bus took the exit they were out of sight.  I've asked around and no one has seen such a vehicle that did not move hovering over city hall.  The sky was over cast. A few days later, I was standing in my back yard one morning and 5 black small pyrimid military jets flew low over my home in formation shacking the ground under my feet with  loud engines noises flying from north to west flying upward into the sky.  I worked as a Human Service Spealist for FEMA from 1996 to 2001.  Office was located off I35. I got dizzy because I could feel ground moving from fault line in area.  A guy from Washington called me into his office and stated that I was a senseative and  not disclose to others beca! use they would not understand. I have seen stainless steel 5'x4' thin 1' thick triangular objects appear and disappear in the sky several feet away from me in Alvarado TX 6 years ago making a static noise when no one else sees them.   I could see the screws that held them together like a quilt of stainless steel pieces.  Three years ago I have seen orange basket balls size balls  of fire spew across the sky within several feet from me in Alvarado TX while visiting my family.  We all saw the balls of fire and hope some day to get a maginet on a stick and try to find them where they land in a field near a creek.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
