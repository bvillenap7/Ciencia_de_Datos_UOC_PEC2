Cigar shaped object with bright lights.;2005-02-10 00:25:00;5 mins.;Cigar shaped object with bright lights. On Tues. 2/10/05 at 12:25 AM I looked out my balcony window/sliding glass door and noticed a light in the sky I didn't recognize.  The direction was southwest.  It appeared to be 1-3 miles away and was somewhat close to the ground.  Initially I thought it was the top floor of a distant building being worked on by a team of welders.  I didn't recall a building being there so it sparked my interest that much more.   Through binoculars it looked cigar shaped.  The middle of it was radiating with  very bright lights (white, blue, red, orange).  It was stationary for a couple of minutes but then started slowly moving north. The object disappeared behind a building that's about 300 yards from me and I never saw it appear on the other side.  It's initial location was about a mile or a little less directly north of E.D.S. (Electronic Data Systems) and as I mentioned before, moved north from there.  It could have been as far away as Dallas Pkwy. between Legacy and Headquarters or just east of there.  http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?name=&ed=9c.Uk.p_0Tphyk14aQcvuUc39CtpL4nWUdfgggS5S5 pYTahcPrl1EhVFeFMSsXv9oRDJ0bhro_ltFvCpaf4oKvxPq2dSZ6e74EIx6.qe0z6IaA--&csz=Plano%2C+TX+75023&desc=&mag=3&ds=n&state=TX&uzip=75023&country=US&BFKey=&cat=shop&resize=l&trf =0   The object could very well have been a blimp but it seemed too long and narrow.  What would a blimp be doing over there at such an hour?  It would be absolutely impossible for someone else to have not seen this object.
