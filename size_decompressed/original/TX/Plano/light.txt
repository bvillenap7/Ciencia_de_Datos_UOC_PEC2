Star-like object made two right angle turns before fading away.;2002-05-20 22:09:00;2 minutes;Star-like object made two right angle turns before fading away. I went out to relax in the hammock and I noticed what I at first thought was a star next to the last star on the handle of the big dipper (Ursa Major), moving due north at a steady rate. It then stopped at the same level as the bottom of the constellation and began to move again in about two seconds at a 90 degree angle to its original path, now heading east in the sky. It stopped again at about the same distance, stopped for a second and then headed north again at the same rate as before, until it dissappeared from view toward the horizon. I am a Director of Operations with a Telecom Company, and have a military background in Communications. I have never seen anything like it. I thought this was a satellite at frst but satellites don't do those things.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
a very fast moving bright, white light that moved at sharp angels and stopped and held a position for about 10 minutes.;2003-03-10 23:30:00;15 min;a very fast moving bright, white light that moved at sharp angels and stopped and held a position for about 10 minutes. i was on my home sitting at the corner of plano pkwy and coit rd in plano tx.  I was waiting for the light to change when i saw a bright light drop very fast out of the sky and disappeared behind the dallas morning star building.  Then a few seconds later it appeared from behind the building moving in a northeast direction and stopped over a neighborhood and what looked like it hovered there for about 10 minutes and then disappeared. The only description I can offer is that it was a bright white light that left a slight trail behind. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the date of the event was March 10.  We have changed the date above.

orange star like object streaking across south-western sky;2005-08-10 21:00:00;45 mins;orange star like object streaking across south-western sky My wife an I are young. Neither of us have ever seen a UFO previous to this occasion, and have only heard stories. I was out on my apartment balcony which faces south, just after night-fall, when I noticed a orange looking star-like object slowly streaking down the sky in the west. The character of the object was that of a comet. The object began above us and to the west of us, and was slowly streaking down in the western sky. The object was moving at an angle so that it may have been only reaching the western horizon, and not actually falling. As the object neared the horizon, it disappeared into the clouds. Six main points of interest that may be helpful to anyone reading this for investigative purposes. 1 - my wife and I both agree that the object had a tail (comet like tail). 2 - my wife and I both agree that the object was shifting horizontally in the sky, and that the tail was not effected - the entire tail was shifting with it (jumping to the left and right). 3 - My wife and I both agree that there was some sort of activity around the object, appearing as dancing blue specks of light to us. 4 - Upon calling my brother who lives about 50 miles away in Greenville, TX he confirmed the same comet like light with a comet like tail, in the same part of the sky, headed the same direction. He saw this briefly before it disappeared into the clouds. (Brother is a religious conservative who would never believe he saw a UFO - he felt this was a comet). 5. My wife and I researched every website we could find on the sky that night, and found no reports of a comet. The Perseids meteor shower was scheduled for within the next couple of days - but this object moved much much slower than any shooting star/meteor that I've ever seen. 6. Both my wife and I agree that the object was an orange ball of light, looking about the size in the sky that a planet looks like when we see mars, only it was moving with a tail streaking behind it.  Myself (age 26)- Open minded individual, who has shown intrest in UFO/paranormal activity. Wife (age 24) - Not open minded, does not show intrest in UFO/paranormal, and pokes fun at these types of things (feels there must be some logical explanation for what we saw that night, like a sattelite or something). Brother (age 29) - Definately not open minded, very conservative (also feels there must be some logical explanation for what we saw that night, thinks it was a comet).  Please note - just found this website months later from the incident - the date of occurence is exact - the time may be off by minutes.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
fast moving white balls increased in size then disappeared;2005-11-06 23:00:00;30 minutes;fast moving white balls increased in size then disappeared I was outside looking at the stars with my dogs in the back yard.   While looking toward the northern portion of the sky I suddenly saw a white ball flew downward at a 45 degree angle at incredible speed.  It then grew to double its size and disappeared.   Approximately 30 minutes later I saw another white ball doing the exact same thing on the southern portion of the sky.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
2 lights appear and become extremely bright then fade one by one into the dark night sky.;2007-11-19 19:00:00;10 seconds;2 lights appear and become extremely bright then fade one by one into the dark night sky. At approximately 7:00 pm on November 19, 2007, I was talking on the phone and looked up in the clear Southern night sky and noticed 2 faint lights moving slowly across.  I would say that they were approximately 200-400ft. apart and stayed in perfect alignment with each other while moving south.   As the two objects moved, one light started to become extremely bright and then the second light became equally bright.  As they continued moving south, the first light that became bright started to dim and disappeared completely, followed by the second light becoming dim and disappearing too.   I am constantly looking in the night sky and was a former Naval Air Crewmen and flew numerous missions while serving in the military.  I am very aware of what aircraft look like and there were no red lights, green lights, or a blinking strobe that are always associated with aircraft.   This is my first experience of an actual truly unidentified flying object in the sky. I am completely elated.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335

Red-Gold Orb over Plano,Texas.;2010-06-27 16:45:00;30 minutes for two events;Red-Gold Orb over Plano ,Texas June 27. 2010 5:45pm. Still Daylight.  Periodic slight cirrus types of clouds were in the sky. I was in the pool at my friends house in Plano , Texas.  I looked up into the sky looking east and noticed a tiny pulsing REDish Gold spec of light in the air.  It was moving northward very slowly. The object was about the size of a head of a pin seen at arms length. I observed for about 5 minutes.  It stopped moving and stayed in a stationary position..  I said to myself that i am going to go to my car to get my digital canon camera.  And i did. When i got back it was hard to relocate the object at first but i finally was able.  It was sitting there for another 4 minutes and then slowly moved off to the north... Minutes later, I noticed another Goldish red orb in another area in the sky.  Basically overhead but  just a few degrees off to the south from just overhead...  It was larger  or lower and perhaps at the cirrus cloud height.  I took a few pictures with my canon camera..   Again it was still broad daylight and it almost seemed to glisten in a red gold type of light..  It was not close enough to tell if it was actually metallic or if it was a light.  I decided for some strange reason to turn the flash on the camera to on..  When I did that and took a photo.  The object that was standing stationary in the sky for about 5 minutes rapidly accelerated toward the southwest..   And then accelerated again and vanished. It was a two stage acceleration, going from still to rapid speed m then suddenly accelerates again to super fast and it was gone. When looking at the photo that I took,  and after I enlarged it,  looks  like all those other photos that you would see of UFOs in the national enquirer, and I laughed to myself.. To the naked eye it was more visible and did not represent any known aircraft.  It was neither a bird nor a balloon.  I did not know of any bird or balloon that will accelerate the way this thing did, or stay stationary they it did while being watched in the North Texas sky..

A white light in the night sky brightened, faded, maneuvered unlike a star/plane/satellite and disappeared.;2011-07-14 22:45:00;20 seconds;A white light in the night sky brightened, faded, maneuvered unlike a star/plane/satellite and disappeared. It was around 22:45 on the night of 07/14/11 and my friend and I (both actors and musicians in our 20s) were outside smoking a cigarette.  I looked up at Orion’s Belt and noticed what I thought was a star moving North Northeast at a smooth, steady pace.  The light was the same color as the other stars in the sky, a bright white with no flicker.  As I inspected the light I noticed that it was too high up to be a plane around Dallas (my house is right underneath the regular flight patterns for incoming planes into Love Field and DFW Airports) and it was moving too slowly to be a shooting star.   I thought it might have been a satellite due to the size of the light and the steady speed, but after 10 seconds the brightness swelled (not like a flash, but like someone manually changing the intensity of an indoor LED light) and dimmed back down, with the light beginning moving in a small zigzag or spiral pattern before it disappeared.  To me it looked like it just faded out of sight but my friend saw the light get smaller in the sky until it was completely gone about 8-10 seconds later, like it shot up into the sky at speeds unmatched by man-made craft.   The entire encounter took about 20 to 30 seconds and occurred just below Orion’s Belt from our position. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the Orion Constellation is not visible during the summer months.  Object sighted may have been the reflection from an Iridium satellite.

We saw a light approaching that changed direction and velocity and went away very fast.;2014-02-11 22:10:00;<1 minute;We saw a light approaching that changed direction and velocity and went away very fast. Blue/Red lights traveling towards us looking like an aircraft coming from NE like approaching like a regular aircraft with normal speed as usual.   Look like regular approach path to DFW then stopped and then started going towards NNE with increasing speed (very fast) and then disappeared on the horizon.   There was a sound like a jet but like a dull sound like the afterburn of a jet engine.

4 bright white objects came together, remained stationary in a row for a time, moved away in different directions at different times.;2014-05-11 14:30:00;30 minutes;4 bright white objects came together, remained stationary in a row for a time, moved away in different directions at different times. A group of us were sitting at a table in the backyard on Mothers Day.  I was resting my head by leaning back in my chair.  I noticed 2 stationary white objects.  As I was watching, I observed another white object moving towards the other two, then a fourth.  I pointed out the objects to the other guests.  1 other saw all 4 objects and 2 others saw only 2 objects.  The 4 objects remained stationary, roughly in a line, for a period of time.  Then one object moved off to the south, then another moved off to the north.  The other two waited a period of time, then also moved off to the north and south.   I am a private pilot, an architect, and a business owner.  My wife, one of the observers, has a master's in psychology, and worked in corporate America for 18 years.  Another of the guests is a retired marine, working in some form of elite forces, now working in telecommunications.   The fourth observer is a stay at home dad.  I know how airplanes, choppers and other craft move! through the air.  These objects were at a high altitude, they were bright white easily seen in the daytime sky.  They did not move like an airplane.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335

Royal blue blinking lights in formation across North Dallas sky.;2016-10-01 20:41:00;30 minutes;Royal blue blinking lights in formation across North Dallas sky. At the park in the dark with my son we see a lot of aircraft.  Our neighborhood is in the flight path of passenger jets flying into Love Field in Dallas, TX.  We have a hospital a 1/4 mile from our neighborhood to the NW and helicopters fly in and land frequently.  But all of a sudden we see 4 royal blue blinking lights in formation.  Three were in an isosolese triangle shape and a fourth was off to the side.  They appeared to be higher than one of the incoming jets initially, about twice as high.  They were blinking in a perfect pattern one after another - all four lights about .5 seconds apart.  They flew slowly North over our neighborhood at the same height it appeared until it was so far north that they almost disappeared entirely.  After about 15 minutes they came closer and brighter again but were much higher up in they sky and were directly above us to the West.  The forth light was trailing further behind and took off towards the West without the three lights in triangle formation.  The remaining three continued to climb straight up until they became smaller and smaller until they disappeared altogether almost directly above where we were standing.  The night was completely still - no breeze or wind at all.  The lights made absolutely no sound.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
47 sphere orbs appearing in a point in the sky and traveling south  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-15 05:00:00;20 minutes;47 sphere orbs appearing in a point in the sky and traveling south I looked at compass on my phone and they would be in a direct line to Houston TX.  I recently got a pretty bad sunburn at work and I have been a little bit stir crazy at night because my skin is peeling so it itches.I am a smoker so I went outside around 440 ish am, so I was admiring the moon when out of the corner of my eye I saw an orb that's what I'll call it so my first instinct was oh nice shooting star but it was moving too slow to be a falling star so I was still trying to figure out what it was then I noticed another one right behind it and another one right behind it they were evenly spaced traveling at the same speed in between each other they were all glowing at the same essence or Hugh whatever you wanna call it and this carried on for a while I counted 47 In total so when I got to about 12 I started knocking on the window telling my wife to wake up and come outside because she needed to see this it was quite amazing, she ended up catching the end of it We just stood there amazed. So I have been googling everything trying to see if anybody saw ! what we saw and I came across almost an exact replica of the same story on this website and he stated he saw 53 in the same exact formation a month ago Only 30 mins away from my location ,that just boggles my mind. So if anybody else saw what I saw please share 4/15/20 around 5 am Plano Tx;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335

Bright stationary flashing light in Plano Texas;2020-07-16 22:00:00;3 minutes;Bright stationary flashing light in Plano Texas I was laying at the pool in a chair drying off before heading back upstairs to my apartment as I looked up toward the sky a flash caught my eye.  I looked up to the nearest star and slightly below it I saw the flash repeat.  There was about a five to seven second delay between flashes.  It flashed about a total of 8 times and on that last time it disappeared and never came back . I noticed no motion at all while I was flashing.  It seemed to be extremely high in the sky it looked like it could have been the brightest star in the sky flashing off and on slowly.  I scanned the sky to see if it had moved position and was blinking elsewhere but I never saw it blink again.  I was able to get about two minutes of video but it only shows up in the first 15 seconds.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
