The object was lit on it's underside, but only in a pattern of a rod. I could tell it had shape outside of the lights appearing on its underside. I witnessed the object for a duration of about 3 seconds before it disappeared, the lights appearing on it were lime green in color and I estimate it flew at about 30,000 feet. It was about 8:38pm CST, on Thursday April 27 when I witnessed the object. I met a girlfriend of mine in the parking lot of my apartment complex, and while she was talking with my best friends fiance(they also live in my complex) I witnessed a triangular object moving at incredible speed from the north to south. The object was lit on its underside in the shape of a rod, but I could make out a black triangular shape outside of the lit area. I could see the object moving for about 3 seconds, then it seemed to just disappear. There was no clouds in the area to hide in, so where it went is beyond me. The speed was incredible, in the couple of seconds I witnessed it it covered a good portion of the sky. To compare in speed, I witnessed the space shuttle coming back in orbit a couple of months ago, it took about 30-35 seconds to cross the horizon. If this object would have stayed visible it would have cleared the horizon in less than 10 seconds. I was fully expecting to hear a sonic boom. My best guess of the size of the object is about 3 times of the size of a 727(in comparison to a 727 flying at 30,000 feet, like this object appeared to be flying at). It definitely dodn't appear to be a meteor, becuase of the color, size, direction of movement(it moved in a staight line). It was definitely a strange site.hhhhhhhhhhhhhh;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
V shaped objects, no lights, no sounds;2011-10-20 23:00:00;:30;V shaped objects, no lights, no sounds I was exiting my car last night, Oct 20th, at approx. 11 pm when something caught the corner of my eye up in the sky. I looked up to see a V-shaped object that was silently gliding fairly slowly across the sky. It went out of my view so I changed locations only to see it make a large circle and then head back north. It was in sight for approximately 30 seconds then moved out of view completely and about that time a smaller object of the same shape and opacity shot from the south heading north behind it. At first I thought it looked like a flock of birds then realized that it was too perfect and when it circled around I got a better view. There were no lights and no sound. The objects were almost transparent, foggy kind of like a cloud but in a V shape and glided very eloquently and smoothly. I have never seen anything other than normal meteorites in the night sky. I was very excited yet perplexed. I do feel validated though when I read on the Examiner that there was another sighting extremely similar just a few miles away from me and only 30 minutes prior to my sighting last night.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
