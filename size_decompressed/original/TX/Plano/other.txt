Boomerang-shaped UFO over Plano, TX;2007-10-09 20:40:00;10 seconds;Boomerang-shaped UFO over Plano, TX My wife and I were sitting in our backyard stargazing in west Plano, Texas (such that it is) Tuesday night on October 9, 2007 when, at approximately 8:40 PM, we noticed a boomerang-shaped UFO flying from north to south almost directly over us. I guesstimate its altitude between 2000-3000 feet flying faster than the usual commercial air traffic. The craft had a grayish translucent color (like a jelly-fish), but was still clearly visible. It made absolutely no sound whatsoever. Its size in the sky was approximately 1.5-2 held out at arm's length. The entire sighting lasted only 5-10 seconds before it was out of sight.  While this was not the most impressive UFO sighting I have had--I have had several UFO sightings over the past 40+ years--this was a first for my wife who, needless to say, was very excited at having finally seen one.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
