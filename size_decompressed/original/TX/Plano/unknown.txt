Light in the sky flashing red and gren with a constant white light due west and slightly north of my home in plano. Very high in the sky but in our atmosphere(I think) about 10degrees south of where I saw it tuesday about 3am. Iput my glasses on a tripod to see if the object was moveing it was but would stay in the same general area as I write this it has moved north alittleand lower in the west so I can no longer see it over the top of my house. watching for one hour now still no idea what this could be. Saw a commercial jet headed for dfw south west from here object is much higher than it's flight line.Object is lower in the sky now further west still just hanging there I don't think it could be a satalite it's just to low in the sky . your best guess? 1:20am lost intrest I give up can't explain it.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
transported into another place by unknown, possibly alien contact attempting to show me something.;1999-08-15 00:00:00;Unknown;transported into another place by unknown, possibly alien contact attempting to show me something. I was in the city of Plano, TX.  I took my dog for the usual walk. I was in an oopen field next to the trailer park where I lived.    On August, 1999, at 12:30 am I was confronted by a 7 ft tall object.  It came and went in front of me.  I turned to go home and again confronted by the object which materialized into a large wolf.  We looked at each other, but he did nothing.  I stood there for while, then turned to return home.  To my surprise, I was in a different place, not in the city anymore, surrounded by Hwy 75, the gas station and trailer park.  I was in a vast, open field which looked like wheat grass.  Night turned to day, and I could see the clouds and trees.  It was like the morning sunrise.  I could hear the grass swishing in the wind.  I was frozen with fear and could not move.  Everything to the right, left and behind me was pitch black.  I turned to go home, and glanced back over my shoulder to find the wolf had disappeared, and everything returned to normal. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and although his story sounded quite bizarre, the witness seemed to us to be quite lucid and objective about the experience.  The date indicated here is approximate, but please see other reports for August 15, 1999, a Sunday, for the dramatic and bizarre immense flash of light that occurred in New Mexico, and surround states.  Other interesting reports for that date, as well.  PD));33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
Big white flash in and thru my car;2006-05-12 23:00:00;2 seconds;Big white flash in and thru my car I was standing at a red light eastward on Legacy Drive at the Dallas North Tollway intersection, when suddenly I saw a big flash on top of my SUV and it illuminated the car on the inside as if someone had taken a picture inside the car with a big flash. It was a big white flash, I rolled down my window and looked  to the car nest to me and the other driver looked at me asked me what was that? ,  I shrugged my shoulders, looked above and saw nothing. I kept driving eastward on Legacy Drive and looking at the sky thru my sideview mirrors and also looking upwards outiside my window and saw nothing else.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
Multiple strange hovering lights seen in the night sky over Plano and Allen, Tx.;2007-08-16 22:30:00;unknown;Multiple strange hovering lights seen in the night sky over Plano and Allen, Tx. My girlfriend and I were driving home from a local eatery at approximately 10:30 PM on August 16th 2007. The eatery is located on Preston Rd just south of George Bush Tollway. The route we took was to head north on Preston Rd and enter onto George Bush Tollway heading east. As we continued this way and reached the vicinity of Coit Rd to Custer Rd we witnessed three strange looking lights in the sky northeast of our location. We first thought maybe they are lights attached to a pole for construction work purposes, but as we approached closer we realized they were higher in the air, but not as high as you might expect a plane to be travelling. We then thought they were low flying planes, but the lights appeared to be brighter than what i'm used to seeing and they did not appear to be moving. We continued to monitor the crafts as we transitioned from George Bush Tollway onto I75 heading north and noticed that there were more than just the original three crafts. As we made the change to I75 there were now 3 to the west, 3 to the east, 3-4 to the north, and 3 to the south as we traveled through Plano. On approach to the city of Allen, Texas we then observed 3 more in the distance to the north and 1 to the northeast. They all appeared to have lights like a plane would have ( red, blue flashing lights with a headlight), but the light seemed to always be facing us even as we changed directions and as mentioned before, they did not appear to be moving. Shortly after we arrived at our home in Allen, Texas I proceeded outside with my binoculars, but was unable to observe anything unusual within the airspace I was able to capture. My viewing space was limited due to homes and trees blocking most of my view. Was there some military action or police action? If so, then why was it not aired on the news? Was there excessive air traffic because of the Erin storm front? Again, why was it not on the news? I was not under the influence of any alcohol or mind altering drugs. I have no history of psychologica! l proble ms and was not excessively tired or drowsy. I have never seen anything like this in my life and have lived in the Dallas area for the large majority of it.

Contrail with sharp angle direction change witnessed over Plano, Texas!!;2007-11-16 16:30:00;unknown;Contrail with sharp angle direction change witnessed over Plano, Texas!! I'm driving home from work east on 15th street approaching Independence Pkwy. when I notice a strange contrail in the sky. It was strange because it had a rapid and sharp direction change. It seemed to be originally travelling SouthWest and immediately transitioned to a straight up direction. I don't believe it was an optical illusion as far as the angle of observation is concerned. I DO HAVE PICTURES TO BACK UP MY STORY. I'm not an expert on contrails, but I have never observed one with such a sharp angle before. It seems to me that the G-forces would not be too forgiving on the occupants inside of the craft. I did see the craft travelling at the upward angle, but could not make out a shape and becuase it was daylight, I could not see any lights. The pictures were taken using my Motorola V360 camera phone and so are not the best photos, but you can clearly see the sharp angle. Any info on what vehicle could complete this type of maneuver would greatly be appreciated.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
I saw a star looking object moving around like a ship in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of star??  PD));2009-05-30 00:00:00;all night;I saw a star looking object moving around like a ship in the sky. I was looking out in the sky because last night i saw what looked like a star the shot down out of the sky. Me and my boyfriend where looking out and I saw a bright bluish looking star, but I had a feeling it wasnt a star so I watched it and it moved. And i told my boyfriend to look at it. It stayed in the same general area but it would move up and down side to side, it would move in circles and it was moving around in the sky for a long time. We got his parents and they saw it too. We also saw about 8 flashes of light across the sky that looked kind of like shooting stars.  We also saw about 4 other stars that were moving like this. But we mainly watched the first one.  I watched it for about 2 hrs.  Part of that time the light got dimmer and dimmer and eventually disappeared but then it came back and it was moving around the sky a lot.  It was too far up to be a plane or anything.  And it wasnt a satellite because it moved around in circles.  It couldnt have been any earthly ships because our ships can't move around in circles and up and down like this thing was. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of star??

Two UFO's one over the other.;2010-11-16 15:05:00;unknown;Two UFO's one over the other. I was walking on the paved trail at the nature center, when i reached the hill i saw what appeared to be two strange looking lines one above the other out on the western horizon.  These two lines somewhat resembled contrails but they were much shorter and didn't get larger with time the way contrails do.  I pointed these two UFO's out to a couple of other people and they informed me that UFO's were a common sight in that area.  I walked up a little bit higher in elevation and looked in the direction where i had previously witnessed the two UFO's and they were still there looking exactly the same as before -- no movement was discernable.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
Large object in the sky/ black out;2011-02-22 15:00:00;10-20 min;Large object in the sky/ black out  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I was hiking with my dog through Suncreek Trail in Plano,TX, the trail opens up into a large area that spans about 10 acres with various paths.  As I was walking I noticed a very large shape in the sky, it was masked by the sky itself and the form could be made out only by the way the clouds where hugging around it. The shape never moved but the clouds did. It was large enough for me to question what I was seeing, so I decided to pull out my phone and take a couple of pictures. As I aimed the lens on my phone my vision closed to a black out, like I was fainting. I tried to shake out of it, and it seemed like a quick head rush and continued on my way, snapping other pictures as I went ( not of the sky though) in fact I never even looked back up ( very weird for me). When I got home I realized that I had not even thought about what had happened until almost an hour later. I went through my pictures and a solid chunk of them where not even there, but I vividly r! emember taking them.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
Bright white light,, aliens, phenomena;2011-07-28 22:38:00;4 seconds;bright white light,, aliens, phenomena There was a bright light that seemed to accelerate toward the night sky at a 30 degree angle until the light disappeared.   No evidence of the sight but there was one witness that saw the same phenomena.   The angle the light disappeared was at an upward angle that seemed to be away from the earth.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335

Both were giving off a faint glow.  Have never seen anything like this before in my life.  They did not make a single sound, which is what really freaked me out.  They were too close to the ground to be a plane or helicopter or anything else Human's have created.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
Unidentified Light - Color Changing and Flashing, Very Fast and Maneuverable beyond anything I've Seen - Plano, TX;2019-05-21 21:42:00;6 minutes;Unidentified Light - Color Changing and Flashing,  Very Fast and Maneuverable beyond anything I've Seen - Plano, TX At approximately 9:40PM on 05/21/2019, I observed a very unusual light, while looking north from my Apartment Complex in East Plano, TX.  To provide background, to the north of my apartment is a major thoroughfare of Aircraft flying West toward DFW Airport and Love Field in Dallas, TX.  I often smoke outside in the evenings and have seen all types of crafts, usually easily determining that they are Commercial Aircraft.  On THIS occasion, the light was different. First, the light was White and moved about half-way across the entire horizon from East to West.  It moved at a MUCH higher rate of speed than any plane.  There were planes in the distance to compare to.  Suddenly, it Stopped.  No slowing, as if a plane was turning… it just Stopped.  It proceeded to move directly Upward at a high rate of speed, and then back Downward at a slower rate.  This is definitely not any maneuver that can be performed by modern aircraft.  It was also quite a distance away.  My guess would be 10+ Miles North of me, possibly near McKinney, TX, but it is hard to determine . The light was Solid White to begin with, then began to flash, and then turned a solid Red.  The flashing was Extremely Bright for something that far away. I ran inside to get my Cell Phone to record the light.  When I came back out, the light was still there, and came above the horizon (so, it couldn’t be a drone… too far away.)  It continued to flash and then moved directly Upward.  It then moved to the East toward an Airplane that was flying East to West.  It seemed to mirror the speed of the plane, but was lower on the horizon.  Again it stopped.  The color changed to a Red from White, and it dimmed by a large amount.  The Light then became bright again and moved back to the West.  I continued to watch the light until it went below the Horizon. I see planes flying in this sky on a DAILY basis… and always keep an eye out for anything weird… this is the FIRST TIME I have ever seen anything like this.  I don’t know WHAT is was, but the movements were not something I had ever witnessed, nor do I believe that the maneuvers could have been completed by any craft with our technology. I DID video what I could, but my footage is grainy, and I’m not a good Camera-Man.  I do narrate what I am seeing.  In any case, here is a link to the Video: https://www.dropbox.com/s/huc2bl3elvlg3j5/0521192142.mp4?dl=0;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
