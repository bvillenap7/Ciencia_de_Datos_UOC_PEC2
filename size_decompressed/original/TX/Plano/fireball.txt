Bright blue fireball of unusual size and distance possible investigation.;2004-12-01 02:35:00;Seconds;Bright blue fireball of unusual size and distance possible investigation. I was nearing home, paying no particular attention to the sky, when suddenly the interior of my car lit up slightly from a bright light in the sky.  I could not have missed it, as it was an extremely bright (almost white) blue light, that I took to be flames similar to something entering the atmosphere.  However, this was many times larger than any comet, meteors, or such than I had seen before, and the object appeared very close.  It lit up at a low altitude, from what I could see, and went out just one or two seconds later.  The sight sent a chill down my spine.  I was surprised there was nothing on the news and thought nothing of it, but last night and tonight I have seen planes flying in formation, low to the ground, in that vicinity.  I have never seen them around before, so I figured that maybe there was something to it.  For a good description, I would say it looked like a bright blue comet, traveling from northish to south.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
