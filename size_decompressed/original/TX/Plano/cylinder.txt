Cylindrical craft  with 3 lights seen over Dallas, 10.09.08;2008-10-09 20:40:00;10 minutes;Cylindrical craft  with 3 lights seen over Dallas, 10.09.08 At approximately 8:40 (central) on August 9th 2008, while driving East on the George Bush turnpike in Plano, Texas, my girlfriend and I observed 3 lights in the distance that appeared in a strange formation.  The lights appeared white, with no blinking lights to indicate an airplane or helicopter. The lights were stair-stepped, going from the bottom left to upper right. We exited the turnpike at Custer Road, and proceeded to do a U-turn to head South on Custer Road in the direction of the lights. By the time we had turned around (approximately 30 seconds) the object appeared noticeably close and the lights appeared to have changed formation.  The object was now moving towards us rapidly, and the lights had changed to be almost on top of one another, the largest or closest at the top. The object moved very quickly from South to North-Northwest, passing almost directly overhead and slightly in front of our car. The object appeared now as a long, dark, pencil shaped dark against the night sky, with 3 lights evenly spaced along it, one at each end, and one directly in the center. At this point the object appeared to be flying lower than the local flight traffic approaching Addison airport. The object then kept moving to the North-Northwest at a very fast speed, and we eventually lost it behind some trees. By the time we got to a patch of open sky the object was gone.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335

It was white and stayed in place for the 2 minutes that I observed it. I took a few pics and zoomed in to get a better look but it moved away horizontally growing East.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
