Motionless small bright white dot in noontime sky northwest of Plano, Texas (DFW) sky vanished in an instant.;1991-05-31 11:00:00;10 minutes;Motionless small bright white dot in noontime sky northwest of Plano, Texas (DFW) sky vanished in an instant. This was a sighting that I experienced back in 1991, and although 26 years have passed, I thought I would document my experience here for the record.   On or about May 31, 1991, I was sitting in a recliner in my back yard by the pool.  The time was approximately 11:00 a.m.   Out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright small white dot in the northwest area of the sky.  I stared at this object for several minutes and it seemed to be at a very high altitude and just stood there motionless.   After staring at the object, I noticed a strange feeling as though they were surveying the entire Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.  I also had a strange feeling as though they knew I was watching them.  It is hard to describe, but it seems there was some kind of telepathic presence.  It made me feel slightly uneasy.   After watching the object for approximately another five minutes, this bright small dot of an object just popped out of view.  One second it was there, the next, it was gone.  I happened in an instant.   Although the motionless standing there was unusual, the real unusual thing was the feeling that I experienced of our entire metroplex being under surveillance and my feeling that whatever it was knew I (and whomever else witnessed it) was watching.

Plano, Texas circular object with rotating flashing red lights;2008-02-08 20:20:00;15 mins;Plano, Texas circular object with rotating flashing red lights At approximately 8:20pm we stepped out to the backyard and we were admiring the clear night sky.  I don't know the constellation name but in the NNE sky I could see the triangle - 3 stars - and noticed a fourth and was surprised to see a fourth star?!  At about 10-15 degrees my daughter and I spotted an object that seemed closer to us than the stars. I would say perspectively it looked like it was about 15 miles from us. We looked around to see the airplane flight paths and watched that for about 2 minutes and decided it was not the same as an airplane.   We did not see this object move in any direction but we did see red flashing lights going around it in pattern almost.  The lights spinning around this object would speed up and then slow down.  We watched this thing for about 8-10 minutes and after the last cycle of flashing around this object it rapidly strobed may 6 or so times and it was gone.  About 30 seconds later we saw a dull white streak across the sky in a northerly direction and spotted another object in the North sky but it was glowing bluish somewhat hazy.  Just as the first object, it just disappeared after watching it for nearly 5 minutes.  About 2 or 3 minutes later, we spotted what looked like a military fighter jet flying in the direction we witnessed the first object - we could tell it was not a commercial jet because of it's profile.  It was flying fairly low - at least low enough for us to see the shape of the aircraft.  It is not common for military jets to fly over our house though there are several bases around us.  My daughter did attempt taking pictures of this second object, however, I'm not sure if that is what was captured. I can forward upon request.  We don't know what it was and we are hoping we weren't the only ones who witnessed this.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335

I rounded a corner and started walking down a hill, when I noticed two bright orange colored stars? in the southwest corner of the sky.   As I watched these two orange colored stars, the top circular shaped object started to vanish.  This higher craft did move slightly before it gradually vanished.   At first I thought these might have been planes, but I've never seen a plane, or light from a plane, simply vanish before my very eyes.   I didn't see the lower circular orange craft vanish, though I assume that it did as well.   When I got down the hill to the lower trail, I turned around and it was gone as well.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
