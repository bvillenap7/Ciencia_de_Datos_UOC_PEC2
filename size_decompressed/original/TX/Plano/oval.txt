UFO in mid-day over Plano, TX.;2010-06-19 12:34:00;2 minutes;UFO in mid-day over Plano, TX. I was outside looking at a plane and I suddenly noticed an oval craft about twice the altitude of the plane.  It was bright white and there was absolutely no cloud cover out  today.  The craft disappeared as I was watching it and then it suddenly reappeared at a lower altitude.  It disappeared a couple more times, being at a different altitude when it reappeared.  The craft disappeared one last time and didn't reappear.   This is not a hoax. I have always been a believer and I'm excited to say that this is my first sighting.  I watch UFO files often and I also did a presentation on intelligent life in the universe in Astronomy class.;33.0331804371195;-96.7216735220335
Oval Greenish-White Light with sparks;2011-09-17 02:42:00;2 seconds;Oval Greenish-White Light with sparks There was an oval light that had a hint of a lime green color.  It moved in a downward motion towards the ground that seemed about 1000 ft away.  It left a trail of orange sparks like a sparkler would produce which lasted about half a second.  There were less sparks than that of a sparkler. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
