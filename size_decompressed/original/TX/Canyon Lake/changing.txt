Unexplained lights in western Comal County skies;2019-12-12 22:00:00;30 minutes;Unexplained lights in western Comal County skies I observed 6 (maybe more)objects at a relatively low altitude of between 10 and 20,000 feet.  It seemed a little lower but I never got close enough to make an accurate description. There were lights of green, red, yellowy/orange, purple and seemed to rotate positions. (think 1965 Thunderbird turn signals)   They also changed the shape from a rounded presentation to a pointier presentation.  They didn't move like anything I've seen. The only way I know how to explain it would be to, think of 2 hands, extended out away from your body.  One hand is open, the other closed. Now, hold them up against the sky. Now switch the open one to closed, simultaneously opening the other hand. The first hand goes to the next position, and it repeated itself several times.;29.9112;-98.2374
