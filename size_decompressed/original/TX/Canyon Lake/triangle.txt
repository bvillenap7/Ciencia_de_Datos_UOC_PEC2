Rendlesham Forest craft they drew from ground obsevations.  They looked like that. I saw 2 by Canyon Lake, TX in Nov 2007. They came out of Bear Creek on FM 2722.  The time was around 9:30 a.m.  I did not report it at the time because I had never heard of a UFO like this, and I was skeptical. The really cool thing about this is they were moving really slow.  When I saw the 1st craft in my rear view mirror I pulled over and jumped out of my truck and watched in shock.  (My camera was on the front seat the whole time.)   The first craft angled up and started to climb. Then the second craft came into view.  Double shock!   They were both on the same flight path. Here is the strange part.  They hit the same spot in the sky and disappeared like they walked behind a tree.   They were the same craft that were spotted in England.  Same shape except they looked longer to me and the bottom looked like it had sharper lines than the drawings on the TV show. This all happened in around 30 sec. Thank you for your time;29.9112;-98.2374
First a triangle bright no sound then transformed into a circular object.

Very crystal clear sky from my front porch in the country.  To the left there was a very bright triangle shape.  I was curious so I obtained my binoculars, it was bright, no sound, went to the back yard after it was stationary then began to move.   I looked with the binoculars and viewed a now circular object with lights all the way around the circle.  It moved lower and then quickly went across the sky out of view.  Again no noise.    I watch the night sky frequently and know the planes, helicopters, etc.  This was a UFO sighting.;29.9112;-98.2374
