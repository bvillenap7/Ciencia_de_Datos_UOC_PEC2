Dancing balls of light over the Texas night sky.;2004-10-15 02:45:00;2 min;Dancing balls of light over the Texas night sky. One night a friend and i were standing in my front yard talking when he suddenly he said whats that.   It was a clear night with an almost full moon, when i looked up to see these two little dots of light.  The two dots were circling about kind of like they were dancing together.   We stood there watching this for about 30 sec., when the only thing I could say was omg.   My friend stood there silent for a moment and then asked me what do I see as if we could not believe what we were witnessing.   About that time when he had asked me, we were still looking at this, the two dots that had been dancing in circular paterns all of the sudden shot away from each other in opposite directions.  They moved so fast that if I had blinked I would have missed it.   Needless to say my friend off 11+ years and I were a little more than shocked.   We stood out there for about 10 more minutes, hoping to see just a little more, but nothing else had occured.  Although we did notice that there were three or four helicopters with only red lights on them approching for the north-west.   We both stood there for a total time of about 45 min. to an hour while the copters approched and pass over us.  There was no way that those choppers could catch or even keep up with the two objects at the rate that they were moving.   My friend and I still discuss what happened when ever we see each other.   If you don't believe what I am telling you then I don't care.  I am telling this to the world because I know what happened and I know what we had seen that night.   Take it any way you want it but that is what happened.   Thank you for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));29.9406;-93.9152
