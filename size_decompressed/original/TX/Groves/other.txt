We saw a slow moving object in the sky coming from the southwest direction. The object appeared as if it had large yellowy, orange flood lights shinning from every side of it and the lights looked like they were in a fog (a hazy, glow around the object). I looked everywhere else in the sky and the sky was very clear. The object was large. My sons thought it was a helicopter and they heard a sound from it. It moved slowly across the sky at a 45 degree angle between us and due south of us. As it got approximately due south of us, the orangey lights went off and a small single white light was on it (not shining out from it, just on it). The object was not hazy anymore. The sound stopped and it changed direction immediately (not a smooth turn, but instantly). It moved towards the southeast sky from our location. After it changed direction, the object moved extremely fast and was gone in approximately 3 to 4 seconds. The object then looked as if it was extremely high in the sky and went higher as it moved away. It did not go out of sight towards the horizon, but went out of sight moving up and away. A plane could not have covered that much distance that quickly. My son called the local airport that night and again the next day (to talk to someone else) to ask if anything had been reported. They had no reports of anything. The sky was very clear that night and stars were all around.;29.9406;-93.9152
