Syncronised lights over Coleman, Texas;2010-10-05 20:30:00;1 Min;Syncronised lights over Coleman, Texas Over the city of Coleman Texas, I first saw what appeared to be a single light high in the sky above.   Gauging from my position and the towers close to it, it was approximately 4 times the height of the closest tower.   My first instinct was that it was an aircraft because it was close to a small airport.   However, then more lights appeared, at the same elevation, all equadistant from eachother, a total of eleven lights, almost like what you would see on a sign where one appears and then more come on from the center.  Once all the light were on, they all disappeared.   So immediately, I just dismissed it as maybe a reflection of some kind.  Then, it happened again, the very same thing and at the same elevation.   I knew then that it must be something.   It happened again and you could see by the illumination of the lights, it was turning to my right.   My first and second sighting was from broadside.  The I say one more glimpse of it as it constinued to turn and then nothing.   I talked to a friend of mine and they said they had saw it too, however in the past, not this time.  Not sure those sightings were reported. I have never discounted the fact that there could be this type of thing but have never experienced it. I am retired Air Force and have viewed many strange lights before which could always be explained and factually proven to be aircraft, sometimes due to clouds and different type of aircraft.  However, this was no aircraft and could not of been a group of aircraft unless they were helicopters practicing a syncronised light show, even that, there were no collision lights observed and they were too close together I would think and too much of a straight line to be that.;31.834;-99.4238
