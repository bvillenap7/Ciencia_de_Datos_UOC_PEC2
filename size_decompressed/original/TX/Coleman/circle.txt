Near Coleman, TX... Orange lights off and on, with no sound;2010-12-16 19:00:00;1 hr;Near Coleman, TX... Orange lights off and on, with no sound On the nights of Dec 15 and 16 we witnessed very strange orangish lights. While night hunting in rural Runnells County on the 15th I saw them only once and then on the 16th my son and I saw them as many as 8 different times between 630 pm and 730 pm.  The lights were at a low angle, approximately 30 degrees.  The lights were circular and would come on and go off and then another would come on in a different location.  It happened fast enough and over a distance large enough that it could not have been a plane.   We never saw the lights move, they only came on went off and then reappeared in another location. The lights were very bright, much brighter and larger than a star and even much brighter than Venus. It was hard to tell the distance, however they were below 30,000 ft as they were underneath the Cirrus  Toward the end of the sightings we noticed what seemed t! o be an increased number of aircraft flying into the area we had been seeing the lights. I’m a Meteorologist and have watched the skies for many years with a discerning eye and I’ve never seen anything like those lights before!;31.834;-99.4238
