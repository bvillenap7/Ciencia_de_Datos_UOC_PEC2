Jagged and erratic movement and hovering!;2015-03-14 00:20:00;>1 hour;Jagged and erratic movement and hovering! Me and my girlfriend saw a bright light in the sky.  We thought it was just a really bright star, but then it began to move kind of erratically!  The light was white but almost like you could see more than one light on the object of interest and almost like you could see it turningâ€¦ it would hover for a min or so and then move again.. still seeing this and it is now 1:08am!   Wish I had my telescope to see if I could see more or learn more about it!;31.834;-99.4238
