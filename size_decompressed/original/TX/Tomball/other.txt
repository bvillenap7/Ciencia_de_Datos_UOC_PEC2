The trajectory was upwards and the flash was a large bright red flame shaped object with a blueish halo and it had a tail and dissappeared into the sky or burnt up? It was much to quick to be an airplane and too large to be fireworks. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting also reported to Brian Vike, Director of HBCCUFO, in Houston, B.C., whose report also appears here.  Please seen third report, as well.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports of apparently the same event seen over Texas.  It is interesting that the event has not been reported from surrounding states, given that a bright meteor can be seen for hundreds of miles around.  PD));30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
Object seen in cloudy sky over Tomball;2007-07-19 05:10:00;10 seconds;Object seen in cloudy sky over Tomball Here is what I saw on July 19th, 2007.   I was on the way home from work in Tomball, Texas.  At the intersection of  F.M. 249 and Hicks St., I noticed an object flying rather low and at a slow speed.  At first glance it appeared to be a small airplane or maybe a news chopper.  But after a few seconds of observation, I noticed that the brown to rusty colored object was indeed a new sight to me!  We have had rain every day for about two weeks and it was very cloudy, so the object only appeared briefly (about ten seconds) and was gone behind the clouds.  The shape is hard to explain, but for lack of a better term, it resembled an upside down helicopter!   Only there was more to it.  A vertical shaft with the lower part of the shaft being slimmer and attached to a horizontal section.  Toward the top of it, there were two more horizontal sections.  One on each side appearing like wings.  Nothing was spinning or making noise or blinking-no lights. Which all contradicts most sightings I have read about in the last day!  It was a brief but exciting experience for me and the first of its’ kind for me.   I have found no way to identify it yet, but I will always remember the way it looked and the movement of this object!  The one other fact the interests me is that the sighting was directly above the Grand Parkway that is being built because it is a huge undertaking that will take years to finish and maybe it was some sort of observation?!  I don’t know, but I have just learned to keep my eye to the sky more often!;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
