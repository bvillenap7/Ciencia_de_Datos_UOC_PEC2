HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Flash was a large bright red flame shaped object;2003-07-28 21:00:00;approx: 5 to 6 sec.;Objects: Flame shape - Number of objects: 1  My wife and I were sitting in the pool and the sky lit up for a few seconds. The trajectory was upwards and the flash was a large bright red flame shaped object with a blueish halo and it had a tail and it disappeared into the sky or burnt up? It was much to quick to be an airplane and too large to be fireworks.  I have written to the witness in hopes to gather more information on this sighting.  Thank you to the witness for the report.
