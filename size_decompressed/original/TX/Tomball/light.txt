Light in nightsky;2009-06-24 01:35:00;30 mins;Light in nightsky Tomball, Texas, which is just north and west of the Houston area.  I am near Hooks Airport this not like anything I have ever seen from the airport.  I was just about to go to bed when I happen to look at the sky through the blinds at an object that was in the due east night sky about 45 degrees up and very high.  I thought it might be Venus- but I am not sure.  So I watched and over about 15 mins it did appear to be moving towards the west and slightly to the south.  The angle from me to the object increased.   At this point I went and got my digital camera and shot several pictures with the flash, until I could remember how to turn that function off and shot several more pictures.  I will send the pictures later when I have time.  I watched this object for almost 30 mins(in total) as I said before it could be Venus or something else.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
multiple orange/white lighted objects seen in sky in Tomball, Tx.;2011-03-11 23:00:00;15 min;multiple orange/white lighted objects seen in sky in Tomball, Tx. While driving home at approximately 23:00 on 3/11/11 in Tomball, Tx, myself and 3 other passengers in my car observed approximately 30-40 lights in the sky with a orange/white hue.  These were the size of aircraft but did not move as normal aircraft.  They appeared to be in a horizontal multi-level pattern and moved in sync. with one another.  There was no sound and they seemed to hover in the sky then move to the north and separated from one another and disappeared from our sight into the horizon.  They seemed to disappear a few at a time.   There is a local airport in the area (David Hooks Airport) and we called them to see if they had any aircraft in the area of this description or picked up anything on radar.  The airport personnel stated they did not have any aircraft of that nature and did not pick up any thing on radar.  This statement was quite alarming as these aircraft should have been picked up on radar.  I do not hold to the belief in alien/extrate! rrestrial aircraft, however this is very unusual.  I also have questions if this could be military in nature.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
Amber Light in Tomball, Texas;2012-08-27 20:45:00;one to minutes;Amber Light in Tomball, Texas I was sitting in my drive way near Fountain and Huffsmith-Korville Road, just south of Tomball talking on my cell phone.  I looked up and saw a amber coloured light moving in a south by south east direction (I was facing due east).  I have a lot of Hooks Airport and IAH Airport traffic over my home.  This “craft” did not have landing lights, strobe, red beacon, right and left lights.  There was no body other than the amber light emitted.  The craft made no sound (as I got off the phone to watch it before it went behind my home).  I would say the light was about a 45 degree angle up, flying in a straghtline...but a little up and down as it moved along.   I have seen amber lights like these before in the area on a previous sighting about three years ago. I am a former professional truck driver and current small business owner.  I have seen many ufos all over the US and I have made other reports before.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
Bright Light becomes two Lights over Tomball, Texas;2012-10-31 19:11:00;2-3 mintutes;Bright Light becomes two Lights over Tomball, Texas I was driving North on 249 and I observed a very bright light in the sky to the northwest about 30-35 degrees up  as I approached Holderieth   I continued to follow the road past the 249 Business turn off and as I watched the Light seemed to remain stationary.  As the road came up to the cross road Hirschfield Road, the light broke into two smaller lights and I had to pay attention to the ramp traffic going up to 249 North and the North Bound Service Road,  I looked up and both lights were gone.    There were no clouds that I could see the Light when at its brightest was just as bright as the 249 streetlights  or brighter.   When they broke into two, I could only see these lights and no stars.  There were no jets in the air around either and neither at marker lights, strobes or red lights as aircraft is required to have.    I am a former truck driver and now small business owner.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
Red Light in my room from outside.;2013-06-05 04:45:00;15 seconds;Red Light in my room from outside. I will say, I have seen many ufos since I was young and I was very sure I had been abducted, but I wasn't 100% sure until early this am.  Even tho, in past instances I have seen evidence of other encounters.   Anyway,  I had just laid down to sleep after watching tv on my computer.  I was in bed and I was awake when I saw a bright red light come through my window which faces the east on the first floor of my home.  It was an intense red light which I have never seen before.  It shone through my blinds into the room about 5 or six feet on the ceiling and walls.  I had a feeling that I should be asleep and then they were gone.  I have two one story homes behind mine and a two story so it would have had to been close to the ground. I was not sure if I should get up or not..so I waited to see what would happen then the light was just gone.  No sounds, no animal noises, not even my ac unit was running.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
