A ufo sits for ten seconds, and disappears completely;2010-10-12 06:00:00;20 seconds;A ufo sits for ten seconds, and disappears completely I was eating breakfast early morning, still dark out. I look out the window to my left and see a light as bright as and about as long as a crecent moon, yet it was not a crescent shape, only a straight line, and I do not believe the object had been there for long, I would have noticed it prior to this point. I could tell it was not moving because it seemed to sit right next to a tree in my yard, though I know for sure it was not that close. I stared at it for a good ten to fifteen seconds, I then looked down at my bowl of cereal for no more time than to find a spoonful, once I looked back up, the object or light was gone. I had not looked down for more than a second, and from my view I can clearly see the night sky and the surrounding area, it would have to have been a very fast object, or one that could easily disappear. I do not know what I saw, but I do know that where ever it went, it either got there quickly from a hovering position, or disappeared compl! etely.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
cigar shaped object streaking across the sky.  NW Houston area;2019-10-12 08:00:00;60 seconds;cigar shaped object streaking across the sky.  NW Houston area Enjoying the cold front this morning looking at the sky.  I am over the landing pattern for IAH and see many airplanes every day.  This object came from east to west and was moving very fast just under the clouds.  Had to look at it a couple of times to make sure i was seeing this correctly.  No sound and covered my viewing area in about 60 seconds. Wish i had my phone.  Will check security cameras for video.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
