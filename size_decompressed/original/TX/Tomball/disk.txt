Disk Craft seen early in am in Tomball, Texas.;2013-09-07 07:45:00;30 seconds;Disk Craft seen early in am in Tomball, Texas I was pulling up to the stop light at Bordeaux and Highway 249 and I was looking up about 30 degrees  to the west and I could see a disk in the morning sky with close a slight tilt to it traveling south.  There were only a couple clouds in the air and some way off in the background. The disk appeared to be flying south for the next several seconds I watched it as it slowed down and changed sizes like it was shrinking.  The light turned green and as I crossed 249 still heading west on Bordeaux it looked like it was the shape of a black ball then there was a little white flash and it was gone.  I searched the sky and could not see where the disk(ball) had gone to.  To give you an idea how big it was initially, if you held a quarter by a third at 3’ (arm’s length) this would be size of the initial craft.   I am not far from Hooks Airport, but this was not a jet, helicopter or plane.  I am IT College Student, former professional trucker.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
