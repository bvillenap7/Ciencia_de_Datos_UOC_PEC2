A large orange round object was spotted by our family dog and she alerted us about this strange object in the eastern sky. The object moved from 2:00 to 6:00 then to 8:00 getting smaller as it went. At 8:00 it simultaneously turned verticallly and into the shape of a cigar. It then steadily moved away into the southeastern sky until we could not see it anymore. As it left it seemed to punch through the sky through a ring of clouds.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382

I didn't see where the object originally came from.  It was in my sight from above the horizon travelling east.  I didn't see where it landed but it was bright green with yellow around it.  It lasted only a few seconds and was gone. It was very bright and I thought it would be reported by hundreds.  I am a secretary and I believe what I saw was a meteor.  It was beautiful.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
Ufo sighting clear night sky.;2012-03-04 20:05:00;2 minutes;ufo sighting clear night sky. 03/08/2012 This report is of an audible and visual sighting of a UFO on 03-04-12 a sunday evening at 8:05pm.  I had set down at my dinner table to eat when i heard a low resonating freqency outside my dinning room window.  My wife had emerged from the bedroom and i asked her to open the door and look out to see if she could see the source of this sound.  She stepped out our apartment onto the patio and yelled at me to come quickley.  When i joined her we observed an object moving northwest across the sky.  The object was apparently circular because the lights were rotating counterclockwise around the object.  The color of the lights were blue and white in color.No other colors were observed.  The sighting duration was about two minutes.  The object flew into the northwestern sky and dissapeared.  One other thing i forgot to mention is when my wife grabbed the front door to open it she recieved an electrical shock!!  This information now concludes this report.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
