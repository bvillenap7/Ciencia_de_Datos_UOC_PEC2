Triangular Craft with bright white, red and green llights.;2002-01-06 17:00:00;2 miinutes;Triangular Craft with bright white, red and green llights. I am a 53 year old female.  I am not sure what I saw.  I got up at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, January 6, 2002. As I was going back to bed, I looked through the blinds to see if it was still raining.  I noticed it was crystal clear and the stars were really bright.  I noticed an unusually bright light to the west and watched it to see if it was a plane.  It didn't seem to move for a while and then I noticed it getting closer.  I just felt it wasn't an airplane.  I grabbed my robe and ran out to the back stoop and as it came closer, I was surprised by how quiet it was.  It had a really bright light in the front.  It passed directly over my house.  Underneath, it had two white lights and a red light.  I likened them to round recessed lights in the ceiling of a house. As it went past there was a bright green light on the rear.  I could just see the outline of the craft in the lights from the craft and I remember saying Wow because I was so surprised how quiet it was.  It had a very soft roar.  I thought I was seeing a stealth go over.  My husband says there would have been blinking lights on it somewhere if it were an aircraft and I don't remember seeing any blinking lights.  Is it possible it was a military aircraft?;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382

Then it dipped down, turned on its side and flew off very quickly to the west in one fluid motion. There was no moon visible.  It was about 200 feet above the ground about a mile away.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
Yellow lights in an triangle form seen by other people.;2013-11-08 20:20:00;18 minutes;Yellow lights in an triangle form seen by other people. It was 8:20 pm on november 8, 2013, we were headed south bound on hwy 249 from magnolia texas. There was three lights in a triangle shape over a wooded area.  The lights faded in and out then one light would go out then reappear.  When one of the lights fade out there was a fire tail as the light seem too fade.  When the lights went out you can see the shape of the object still visible to the naked eye,  The triangle shape did not make no noise.  This happen for a good 15 minutes, when the object finally disappeared an aircraft appeared and was noticeable by the obvious lights white/blue flashing indicators.  Trying to simulate the same flight pattern as the object took.;30.0709589285714;-95.6327630952382
