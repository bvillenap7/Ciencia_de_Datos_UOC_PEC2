It honestly looked like a red planet.  HUGE RED PLANET.   Two city patrol cars we passed pulled to the side of the road during this event.  Many people witnessed this, including anyone driving w bound on US 82 Gainesville, Texas.   I told my husband after i caught my breath, please tell me that is the moon.  We were speechless.  How could this major rust red circular shape be here then gone.  It was almost as though it was a fast sunset but this is at nearly 1 am so.............  Please contact us back on this. My kids are freaking out.;33.6556;-97.1578
