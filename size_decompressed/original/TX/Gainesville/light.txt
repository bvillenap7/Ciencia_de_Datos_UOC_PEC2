I am reporting what I saw when I was a kid.  My parents had a 1982 Z28 and they used to let my sister and I ride on the back part of the hatch.  We would look up at the sky while my parents drove. I was doing so one night and saw a bright light that looked exactly like a star in the sky.  The only thing is that the light would move from one point in the sky to another extremely fast.  It would move across the entire sky in the blink of an eye.  I tried to notify my parents and they just blew me off saying something like yea that is neat. It did this about 4 or 5 times I would say.  It was not a straight line back and forth. It would go to one side, and then go down. E to W, then W to NE and so on.  Then it just vanished.  I looked for it the rest of the way home and I have never seen anything like this again.   I do not remember the exact date but it was in the summer of 1982 in Gainesville Texas while driving West on highway 82.   I have only told 2 people about this my whole life and I strongly believe it was a UFO only because it moved so fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
