Bright light moving steady across the sky from horizon to horizon.;2005-05-04 21:35:00;apx. 4-5 min;Bright light moving steady across the sky from horizon to horizon. I started out seeing it when it was about 1/8th distance across the sky the southern direction.  I was looking east while watching it.  I told my friend who was there to turn around. Then I went in the house and got my mother.   All three of us watched it until it went out of site in the north eastern horizon.  It was a redish, yellowish bright light.  About 5 times bigger and brighter than a star.  It was moving straight and it was not blinking.  You could see airplanes off in different directions.  It looked nothing like them.   When it seemed like it was straight in front of us it looked like it got brighter.  That might have just been an optical illusion though.  I live far out in the country away from city lights.  It was making absolutly NO sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Object could not have been the International Space Station, since it passed over this area an hour earlier.  PD));32.2468;-94.4516
