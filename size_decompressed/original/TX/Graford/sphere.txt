We were amazed and stared at it as it came close to us, went over the top of us and moved to the northwest until we could no longer see it.  These are college-educated people with common sense and would like to know what we saw. We all agree on what it looked like with different ways to describe it.  First, it was orange in color with a fire or fire-like source of energy on the inside of this translucent object.  We all agree that it could be described as a small hot air balloon, jellyfish or Chinese lantern.  It was not a total sphere.  You could also describe it as a dome with a rounded top. The object made no sound and traveled in a direct line from SE to NW at a swifter speed than the wind that came out of the east.  We were concerned that if there was fire inside, the hills could be burned if it floated down.  It did not come down, however, and continued at a constant altitude and speed until we could no longer see it. None of us have ever seen anything like it and are very interested to know what we saw.  We ruled out weather balloon because of the constant altitude and speed, or a hot air balloon because it didnâ€™t appear to float with the air current and it moved too fast.  We thought of a drone but we heard nothing.;32.9242;-98.337
