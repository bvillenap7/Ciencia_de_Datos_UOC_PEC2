My husband and I had just exited Loop 281 going towards Hallsville on Hwy 80.  He pointed to a long green light in the sky.  I looked up and there was a fairly long object glowing green moving slowly across the sky towards the left.  The light was steady and there were no other visible colors.  It then turned into a small dot and then completely disappeared.;32.5117;-94.5319
