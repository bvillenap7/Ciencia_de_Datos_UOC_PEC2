It was a neat color orange that never changed in brightness or in direction or speed (much like a satellite). This is not the first UFO I've seen.  I've seen them two times earlier around 1997.  The first time I witnessed one was a Spectacular site.  It happened over Colorado Springs viewed from just south of Cripple Creek very far away.  I was with a roommate walk back to town after running out of gas.   The point of light moved over C.S., just like a laser pointer on a wall would if you moved it wildly back and forth up and down.  It did this for about 3 min. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));30.1437;-96.6846
