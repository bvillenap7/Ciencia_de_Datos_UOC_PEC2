It was a cool night with not a cloud in the sky. We were on top of a hill calling for coyotes when one of us said look at that. We all looked and saw a big white light with three more colors which were orange, purple, and red flashing often right above the trees around half a mile away. I looked through my scope and it was sphere shaped and moving left to right. We watched it for about twenty minutes. We knew that no one would believe us so we ran back to the house to get my mom and when we returned it was gone. This is not a fake story and we are one-hundred percent positive of what we seen that night was not normal.;33.6979;-95.3856
