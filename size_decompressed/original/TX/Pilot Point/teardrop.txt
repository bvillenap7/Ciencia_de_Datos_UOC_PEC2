((HOAX))  9:20 a gray object hovering above the horizon, emitted no light or sounds.;2008-04-11 21:20:00;21:21;9:20 a gray object hovering above the horizon, emitted no light or sounds I was walking down a street at 9:20 at night and on the horizon above a house I saw a object. The object was slowly flying and did not produce any sound. The object was shaped like a horizontal tear drop and was a light gray in the front and a darker gray towards the back of the object.  The other two people that were with me saw the object to and started to chase the object.  Then suddenly the object disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report is a repeat anonymous caller.
