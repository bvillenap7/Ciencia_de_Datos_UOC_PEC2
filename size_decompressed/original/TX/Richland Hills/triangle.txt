Black triangular craft seen from below and side views with an array of lights;2009-12-15 12:23:00;10 minutes;Black triangular craft seen from below and side views with an array of lights I observed an unknown object hovering over 121 S near Handley-Ederville Rd.  The object slowly moved over my car and continued hovering.  It was triangular in shape and had a white light in each of the three corners of the triangular object with a bigger white light at its center.  From the side view it was rectangular and had multiple lights, three of which were flashing.  It slowly moved north towards Highway 10, over the neighborhood, and past Highway 26.  Then it headed west towards Saginaw and turned north.  It made a high pitched whirring sound like a turbine.  The object was black with all white lights.;32.8404;-97.2285
