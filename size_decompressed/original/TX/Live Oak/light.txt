Bright sting of lights moving at high speed then disappear.  ((Spacelink satellites??));2020-01-07 05:52:00;30 seconds;Bright sting of lights moving at high speed then disappear At 5:52 AM I got into my car and noticed what I thought was a glare on my windshield.  It was really being then directly after I got out of my am at and saw a bright string of lights directly over my neighbor's house.  It was long and very bright.  Like super charged LED lights in a string.  I ran and called my husband to look and it was gone.  Then I noticed it just about disappearing into the sky and was able to catch photos of it before it just disappeared.  It was hovering over my neighbors house then took off at a high rate of speed and was gone in about 10 seconds.;29.547449131944;-98.2954696180566
