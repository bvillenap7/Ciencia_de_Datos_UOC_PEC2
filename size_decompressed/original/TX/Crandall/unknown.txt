This may not be a UFO, but I for one have no idea what it was. June 21, 2008 at around 4:45 AM I was on highway 175 headed towards Seagoville, Texas from the Kaufman area.  It was lightening to the South West.  I had just got out of Crandall when I saw some lightening and immediately followed by a turquoise flash of light near the ground several miles off.  It looked like the lightening may have hit a transformer. A few minutes later I saw the flash again in the same spot.  It was very bright and lit up the sky like lightening but it emanated from the ground.  It flashed like a fast strobe for about a second.  It had the look of a search light or a focused beam of light where you can see the path the light takes through the air, but it was in a wide arc. As I got closer to Seagoville I could see it better and it looked like it was coming from the ground somewhere between 175 and I45.  The light flashed the turquoise light and I was close enough now that I could see pink light mixed in. It was so bright that it lit everything up in the turquoise color, like how lightening gives everything a blue tint. I’m not sure if something was exploding or if it was firecrackers (it would have had to been an insane amount if it was), or some kind of show going on in a field.  It could very well likely be something mundane.  I just know that I’ve been driving passed that area at that time every Saturday for over a year and I have never seen that before, there or ever. I couldn’t have been the only one that saw it.;32.6265;-96.4506
