A glowing green oval-disk shaped object appeared in the sky.;2011-11-13 21:45:00;30 seconds;A glowing green oval-disk shaped object appeared in the sky. I was on my daily jog around my neighborhood and i saw a glowing green oval-disk shaped looking object falling for about 10 seconds and then it just dissapeared.  I have no idea what is was and it appeared in the sky out of no where over a field close to a cemetary.  I sprinted back to my house and took my family back to where i spotted it and we didn't see anything unusual.  Weird.;32.6265;-96.4506
