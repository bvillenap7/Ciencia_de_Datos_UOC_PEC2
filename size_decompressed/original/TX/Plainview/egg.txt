seeing an egg shape object in the daylight sky;1986-06-01 05:00:00;5 min.;seeing an egg shape object in the daylight sky This sighting happened in Plainview, TX. right in the outskirts of Plainview. I was playing basketball by myself when something cought me eye. It was reflecting of and on. Something like a diamond ring does when you put in the right light. I thought it was an airplane because that's about the distance I could see it. This object was just still, the occasionally it would move to the rght and then bacl left. It was doing this for some time. I the called my cousin who was nearby and pointed it to him. We were fasinated by this object. It did this for sometime and the it moved futher to the right and then it just kept on going right and just dissapeared. I think it just went full throttle. It never went up it just dissapeared into the horizon.  I really never told anybody other than my parents. I know there's something outhere it's alot of space out there, I just hope i'm still alive when they find concrete evidence that there is life out there.
