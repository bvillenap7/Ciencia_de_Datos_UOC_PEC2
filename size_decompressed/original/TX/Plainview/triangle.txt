It blended perfectly with the night sky.  I only saw it because I was staring directly in it's direction.  This is the 5th time I've seen this object at night while observing the night sky.   Bright balls of light and explosions of light are sightings that often occur as I sit on my roof at night.;34.1962;-101.7259
