We where coming out of ferris into the palmer city area it was around 11:00pm. We all the sutton heard a lound kind of like a bomb noise. Somewhat like thunder the the sky , It was a burst of the brightest blue light i have ever seen in my life. then it was gone i looked out the window to the left of me and there was 4 round balls of light in a line like this ( \ ) you could tell there was a object behind it but it disapeared so fast i could not make it out.I came home and called the federal avaition department in washington and they said that several piolets and people reported seeing it and that it was probley a meteor . Well im sorry i dont belive that ,I have never in my life seen anything like this and it scared the crap out of me. And just like i told them im not on drugs .;32.5179;-96.6682000000001
My father was standing outside of the garage and noticed four lights traveling the exact same speed.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-24 21:00:00;10 minutes;My father was standing outside of the garage and noticed four lights traveling the exact same speed going on the exact same path. He ran to the backyard to show me, but I was in my room. He found me and we hurried outside to see nothing. He told me what he had seen and less than moments later a path of lights, way too high too be planes, which were a faint gray-blue color follow one another into the sky above us.  The convoy lasted for about ten minutes.  I used binoculars to observe some of the lights and while watching closely, one shot another light out of the side of it towards the east at the same speed the convoy was heading southeast.;32.5179;-96.6682000000001
