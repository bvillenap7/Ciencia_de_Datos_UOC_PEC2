Fire in the sky.;2014-10-03 08:00:00;5 minutes;Fire in the sky. the wife and I were heading to grocery store and saw huge fireball in sky.  You could clearly see the flames and it was moving south at a very high rate of speed.  By the time I got pulled over and my phone out to record it was too far out of sight.   This was totally cool.;32.5179;-96.6682000000001
