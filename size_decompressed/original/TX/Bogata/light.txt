Bright orange lights;2006-03-14 19:30:00;5 minutes;Bright orange lights I first noticed a single orange light. I got up to see what it was because it seemed too bright to be an airplane..A second light appeared next to first light, then both went out. Called husband to look, he called me a kook...Luckily, 3 more appeared while he was looking..Then the 2 original came back...The 3 were in a different location than the first 2, the first 2 were in the same place when they came back...They made no noise and didn't appear to move any. They lit up then disappeared.;33.4682;-95.1974
