3 amber light horizantal shap then turned to 6 lights all amber in color;2009-02-06 19:30:00;2 minutes;3 amber light horizantal shap then turned to 6 lights all amber in color Thursday night February 6 2009 at 7:30 pm, my family and I were traveling south on Hwy 281 near Stephenville Texas.  My father was driving and I was in the passenger’s seat.  In the back seat of the Truck was my mom and my three Kids age 10, 4, and 2.  I was looking at a radio tower that was blinking off in the distance.  When all of a sudden 3 amber colored lights came on in a horizontal row.  I asked my Dad what the hell it was, to which he said” it’s the UFO.  He pulled the truck to the side of the road.  By this time there were 6 amber lights all in row.  With an additional 3 down to the left side below the 6 original lights.  The light appeared to move and change quickly.  My father stepped out of the truck to see if he could hear anything and it was silent.  And then they were gone.  I would say these light where unlike anything I have ever seen.  I posted what happened that night on my face book page.  A friend of mine blogged back that she had gotten a text message from a friend at 7:40 pm say she had seen what she described was what my family and I saw.;32.2160585365854;-98.216224390244
