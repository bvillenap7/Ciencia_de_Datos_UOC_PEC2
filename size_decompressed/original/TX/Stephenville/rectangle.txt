Extensive news coverage.PD));2008-01-08 17:14:00;3 minutes;Flashing strobes, silent, flames out the back side and jets chashing it! On 1-8-2008, at 6:15 pm cst. my friends and I were watching the sunset when several strobes or flashing lights coming from the east at about 3500 foot agl heading west toward Stephenville, Tx..  Estimated speed was about 2000 to 3000 mph.  The strobes made several changes of flash patterns and configurations.  The flight duration lasted about 3 minutes.  The front two strobes was about 1/2 mile a part and the back ones was about 1 mile back from the front strobes.  The back side of the flashing lights came to a verticle flashing.  Then there was 2 seperate vertical flames about 1/4 mile apart for several seconds and the craft was gone.  We never head ANY noise from the craft!  They headed west towards Abilene, TX.  Then about 10 minutes later here came the craft again with 2 jets chasing.  They was headed east towards South Ft. Worth, TX, at about 4000 ft. agl.  The jets was unable to catch and went off into the distance at FULL throttle.  I am a pilot and have been flying for 30 years and have never seen anything like this.  I also fly several times a week in the area.  The craft is NOT from around these parts!  The witnesses are 1. ((male name deleted) 254-((number deleted)), rancher/trucker  2.
