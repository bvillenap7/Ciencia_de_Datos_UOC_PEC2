Central Texas Sighting in Fall of 1997. Pulsing, single craft at EXTREME SPEEDS.;1997-10-15 20:45:00;10 minutes;Central Texas Sighting in Fall of 1997. Pulsing, single craft at EXTREME SPEEDS. On a Fall night in 1997 I witnessed a pulsating object in the western sky. It was an extremely calm night. No wind. The object started out as a red light hovering very high in the sky. It stayed in that position for sometime. At this point it did not look suspicious. As we topped a hill, I called this object to the attention of all the members in our car. We stopped at the top and all 7 of us noticed a pulsing red light. It would also show some white pulsing. After about 10 minutes the object jumped across the sky due north. It appeared to travel at an extreme rate of speed. It burned a red light then shot across the sky. It also traveled up, way up to what seemed 40,000 feet or higher, higher than any aircraft we have spotted. It shot back at the same extreme rate of speed. The children were extremely frightened. This action did not seem reasonable for an airplane or any other known aircraft. We watched as it shot straight up and due north, then disappeared. I went outside later that night, the air was crisp and I noticed the lack of wind. I have spotted similar objects in the night sky, without the movement, always on calm nights without clouds or wind. I swear this sighting to be the truth. I am a teacher and would not have believed this had I not seen it with my own eyes. The exact date of the month I cannot recall, it was a week or so before Halloween. It started before sundown and continued for 10 to 15 minutes. Did anyone else see this? I was in central Texas and felt sure that any state west of us could have also experienced this. It was a single craft, with pulsing lights, red off and on. Very unusual. Very.

I was in my downtown Stephenville studio outside laying on my back smoking a cigarette when I saw what I thought was a shooting star and when I expected it to fizzle out it leveled out and then zoomed off into the horizon. It looked like a circle in the middle of two smaller circles as wings. No sound Faint red non blinking lights.;32.2160585365854;-98.216224390244
