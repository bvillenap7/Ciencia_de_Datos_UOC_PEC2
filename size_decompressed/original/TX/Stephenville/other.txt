It was flying right above the ground, and right in the middle, it had a round glass that hung down  and was flashing.  It made no sound at all.  I was so taken aback.  I didn't even stop to take a picture.  I have looked and researched shiny silver planes that fly low to the ground taking pictures, but can’t find anything matching my description.  I will never forget what it looked like and what it was doing.;32.2160585365854;-98.216224390244
