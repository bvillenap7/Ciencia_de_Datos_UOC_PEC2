It was a bright clear night, and we were each facing the road, and the house across the road. My friend sitting next to me then goes “What ((deleted)) is that?!”  And pointed to the sky, above the house across the street.  It was a boomerang/V shape, and all you could see was it’s silhouette. No lights.  No sound.  As it passed above me however I could see 5-7 orangish/reddish glows.  It was a bright enough night, and the object was close enough, 100-200 feet high, so see it’s outline perfectly.  It just passed over our heads going a steady slow speed and went on it’s way.  We each immediately started screaming in utter disbelief in what we just saw.  I just remember that being the moment, I knew we were all being watched by something.  That moment changed my life.;32.2160585365854;-98.216224390244
