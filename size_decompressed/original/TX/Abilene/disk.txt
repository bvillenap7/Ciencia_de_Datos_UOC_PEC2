It was silver coloured and shaped somewhat like a disk or ellipsoid. As we are both aviation nuts, we attempted to identify it, but the combination of the odd shape and even stranger lighting pattern defied description. I clocked it at approximately mach 3 (2250 mph), which is well beyond the bounds of civil aviation. It then pulled up and lost speed faster than I have ever seen a human aircraft do. When it slowed to a stop, it simply slid backwards until it was behind a building in the distance. Obviously, this surpasses the capabilities of *any* human-built aircraft. It either landed or sped of at ground level, because we neither heard nor saw an impact or an explosion. As Abilene is the site of a major Air Force Base (Dyess), it would seem to be a logical place for any Extraterrestrial activity. Most of the United States' B-1B Lancer High-Speed bombers are stored there. However, they have a max. speed of about mach 2, and are all painted dark brown. They are not a viable explanation exept perhaps as an attraction for Extraterrestrial attention.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
