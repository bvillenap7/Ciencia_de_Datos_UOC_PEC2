Brilliant magnesium diamond seen over Dyess Air Force Base/ Abilene ,Texas;2007-04-27 00:00:00;6 minutes;Brilliant magnesium diamond seen over Dyess Air Force Base/ Abilene ,Texas Bright spherical object traveling slowly, moving from northwest to south east across the southern part of Abilene, Texas. The object passed under the moon and revealed a diamond shaped metalic form at aproxmatley 10,00 feet elevation. I watched the object for a few minutes noticing that it did not have the standard light configuration that is typical of modern commercial and military aircraft.(No blinking lights just an intense magnesium type light). It vanished shortly after passing out of the moons halo. Abilene is home to Dyess Air Force Base and I see military and civilian aircraft all of the time but this was something I have never seen before.The fact that it disappeared in an absolutly clear west texas sky considering it s phenominal brightness is weird to say the least.The object traveled approx 12 miles during the sighting.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
Was lights in the sky over Abilene;2009-01-31 19:30:00;few seconds;Was lights in the sky over Abilene We were driving East leaving Abilene and saw a bright stationary light that did not appear to be moving.  We thought it might be a helicopter or tower of some sort, but as we got closer the bright light became 3 lights, then one blinking light.  As we drove past, there were no lights on the back side of whatever it was.  Then the light was back, then gone again.  A few minutes later the passenger of the car saw what appeared to be a bright meteor streak across the sky, but then as the glow “burned out” the object moved 90 degrees from its previous path and disappeared.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
