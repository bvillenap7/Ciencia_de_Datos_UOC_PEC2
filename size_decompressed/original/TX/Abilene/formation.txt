Mulitple Light formations of many colors.;2012-12-08 19:48:00;6 minutes;Mulitple Light formations of many colors We were leaving the house when the wife noticed these odd lights traveling silently from south to north.  Came in several groups, no recognizable formation, but most groups were 5-10 lights and seemed fixed in relative position.  Some groups appeared more fluid.   Utterly silent.  Red, white, blue, green and orange colors were observed, so changing from one to the other.  Colors were odd in appearance.  Just a big convoy in the night sky.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
