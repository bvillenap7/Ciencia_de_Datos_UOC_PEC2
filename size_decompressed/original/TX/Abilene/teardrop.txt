White egg/teardrop craft seen hovering near Abilene, TX;2021-06-24 14:00:00;10 minutes;White egg/teardrop craft seen hovering near Abilene, TX On Thursday June 24, 2021 I was heading from Abilene, TX along FM 600 (also called West Lake Road) toward Nugent, TX at approximately 2PM. I spotted a large white object in the sky. I kept waiting for it to move but it did not. The closer I got to it I realized it was hovering in the air below the cloud line. As I got closer, I could see it was a polished white and reflected the sunlight. If I had to guess, I would say it was roughly the size of a CH-47 military helicopter. It looked to be sort of egg or tear dropped shaped with now windows, fins or any visible propulsion system. I continued down the road with the object to left of me. As I drew up along beside it, it stopped hovering and matched my speed exactly (approximately 70mph) with the “tip” of the object facing the same direction as the front of my vehicle. At a certain point, I passed two radio/cell phone towers (the really tall kind with red blinking lights on them), the object passed between them! at about ¾ of their total height. Soon after this, the object turned left suddenly and began to fly away from me.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
