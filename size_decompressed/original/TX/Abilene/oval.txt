The shiny hovering object sat there, then it was suddenly gone.;2004-12-23 16:00:00;5-10 seconds;The shiny hovering object sat there, then it was suddenly gone. I can't recall the date and I unfortunately looked away, so I never got a great look at it.  I was driving our car with our son in the back and my wife in the passenger side. We were travelling down Treadway Blvd headed north getting ready to turn at a light onto south 7th street. My wife had said something and about that time I looked up.  Granted we were near the airport, but as an avid aircraft fan, I know a plane and chopper when I see them.  This wasn't either.  It was oval in shape and just sat there in one spot.  It was so shiny that you really couldn't look directly at it because of the sun glinting off of it.  From what I could see there were at least three lights situated around the top and a black thin line through the middle as if there were a line of windows. I turned to my wife and asked her what the thing was, and when she looked she said she didn't see anything.  I looked back, and it was gone.  there was no way of knowing which direction or anything. If it hadn't been for ABC's show, I wouldn't have known about this.  My wife keeps laughing at me saying I have lost it.  Hopefully there are more people in this area that saw this.  It makes me feel so alone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Formations of blue-white, silent lights travelling at high speed over Abilene Texas.;2012-08-17 21:30:00;30-45 seconds;formations of blue-white, silent lights travelling at high speed over Abilene Texas. At approximately 2000 hrs Aug. 17, the block on which I reside had a power outage due to a blown transformer.  About 2130 hrs, I decided to take my dog for his nightly walk, and , as we were returning back to the house, I noticed a formation of approximately 7 or 8 blue-white lights, oval shaped, heading at a high rate of speed, in something like an octagonal formation.  My neighbors were out and witnessed the same formation, and we discussed what ehy could be.  There was absolutely no sound, the darkness from the power outage made for a clear and undistorted viewing.  As they flew in a northwesterly direction, several of the shapes changed position in a rapid, darting movement, at sharp angles, before disappearing into the distance.  I continued down the street, and encountered 2 other neighbors, who had also seen the same lights.  They also reported hearing no sound from the objects, even though they appeared to be at a low altitude, perhaps 2000-3000 ft. At  th! e end of the block , several people were outside, discussing the power outage and the work of the power company crew making repairs.  At about this time, roughly 10 minutes after observing the formation of lights, 3 more lights streaked overhead, in a single file formation, 2 close together and the &quottail end Charlie&quot at a greater distance back, moving at an even higher rate of speed to catch up.  They were travelling at speeds much faster than military or civilian aircraft, and made no sound of any kind. As the first two travelled off in the same northwesterly direction as the earlier objects, they split off 90 degrees from each other and appeared to come to a hover, allowing the 3rd object to catch up, and then all 3 disappeared at something like warp speed. I could make out no clear shape, but they appeared more oval than round, and there were no running lights of any kind, just blue-white ovals travelling at mach type speeds.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
