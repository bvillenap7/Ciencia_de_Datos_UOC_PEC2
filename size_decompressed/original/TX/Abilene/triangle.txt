Swaying round light at rooftop height between 2 houses and right above--a huge triangular black object--no sound.;1991-09-01 01:00:00;10 Minutes;Swaying round light at rooftop height between 2 houses and right above--a huge triangular black object--no sound. In my vehicle was myself and my 3 sons--all under 14 years of age at the time.   I was driving along and I looked to the side because this light caught my eye--I stopped.  This light didn’t have a beam and it was swaying back and forth between two houses right at rooftop  height.  I looked up above to see where the light was coming from and it was a huge triangular shaped object in the sky.  This round light started to come towards my car--everything around us seemed gray and quiet and no sound--it felt like time standing still..  I have always heard of missing time and I glanced at the time on the car.  I went out right at that time and when I came to I looked at the clock and I was missing one hour.  I asked my kids if I had fallen asleep and they said no--they said we hadn’t been there very long.  I asked them if they had seen the light and they said no.  I didn’t realize there was a place to vent like this and I’m glad I can finally say something.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
Pictures were taken on cell phone.;2009-04-07 22:30:00;30 minutes;Pictures were taken on cell phone. My son, ((namd deleted)), came to my home in Buffalo Gap, Texas at apprx.  23:00 tonight 4-7-2009 and asked “if there have been any TV reports of a meteor or anything else crashing in our area.” I had not heard of anything because I was not watching live TV.  We were watching a recording of an earlier program we like to watch.  We had been out on a local lake with my son (the one who saw this object) earlier in the evening .  Our favorite program came on and I recorded it while we were still out on the lake.  My husband and I came on home and left our son at the lake so he could catfish after dark. When we got home we turned on the recording and were watching it from 22:00 to around 22:58.  The signal was interrupted several times as we watched the recording.  This is not a common occurrence at all on recordings from our HD TV. We just kind of wondered why the signal was messed up and let it go at that.  When my son came in around 23:00, he mentioned that he had seen something really “strange” streak across the sky as he sat out on the lake in our boat. He said “It was HUGE”…. And that jets from the Air Base (Dyess) had gone up shortly after the object appeared, streaking across the sky towards  Buffalo Gap, where we live. He said the object looked a lot like a meteor streak but was “huge” . He went on to say that the jets from Dyess were circling the area around and between Buffalo Gap and Tuscola (to our southwest approx. 5 miles).  We have no idea what he might have seen , but thought we should say something to someone.  Surely, many others must have seen this event as well.  We thought you might want to check into it and see what it might have been.  Incidentally, my son is 31 years old and not a goofball. He called me after he left my house to go to his apartment (he doesn’t live with us and had come to bring our boat we had left with him) and said that there was several aircraft in the sky still circling our area.  It was approx 23:45 at that point.  It is not unusual to see aerial ac! tivity w ith the Dyess Air Force Base right in between Buffalo Gap and Abilene…however, it is odd to see a cluster of activity around an unknown event as my son saw.  He does not have Internet and I sent this .  I am sure he has lots more details he could relate first hand. Thank you   ((name deleted));32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
Just a fairly quick fly by from some craft Ive never seen before.;2009-08-21 03:23:00;less than 1 minute;Just a fairly quick fly by from some craft Ive never seen before. I was at a friends house over night just hanging out and we stayed up all night.  My friend was playing a video game and I stepped out side in the back yard to catch the breeze.  He has a picnic table so I lied down and looked up for a few minutes, saw a shooting star and kept looking up.  At 3:23 a.m. I noticed 5 dim non blinking yellow lights in a pattern moving over the top of a tree headed due south toward downtown.  They were arranged in a V pattern and I could see the black out line of the craft barely against the black sky. It made no noise, just cruised almost directly over me for about 20 seconds, then I lost sight of it when it flew behind a tree and into the light coming from the downtown area. Dyess AFB is just a few miles away and I stay up every night so I know this was no airplane, we see those all the time.  It made no noise and traveled about as fast as the little planes at Abilene Regional Airport, just casually cruising by.  Thats about it.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
Triangle sighting over Abilene, Texas;2012-03-23 22:00:00;8 seconds;Triangle sighting over Abilene, Texas At 2200 hrs I witnessed a triangular object flying overhead in the night sky at a controlled rate of speed.  The first view of the craft was a triangle with 1 ea. leading light, and 2 ea. trailing lights.  Although it was dark I was unable to see through the center area of the lights as if it had a body connecting the lights together.  While it was overhead I was able the lights looked as though there was heat radiating from around them.  As the craft continued following the course it was on it seemed to have change of its structure was positioned.  Quickly the forward light shot upward as the two trailing lights seemed to expand their distance between one another.  After the forward light shot upward it began to drop back down.  From the position I was in at this point I was unable to tell if dropped back down to the forward position or if it was now in the trailing position.  The sighting lasted roughly 8 seconds and was not moving in style of aircraft I h! ave seen.  I did not see any indicating lights from any aircraft in the local area around the time of the sighting, and the local air base was not conducting any flying missions.
