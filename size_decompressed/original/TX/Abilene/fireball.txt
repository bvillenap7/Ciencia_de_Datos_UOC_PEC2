Largest Falling Star I've ever seen;2007-07-06 02:20:00;2 seconds;Largest Falling Star I've ever seen Myself and another police officer were standing outside our vehicles talking and we saw what looked like the largest falling star I have ever seen. But, in the tail/ trail of the UFO, there were sparkles before it disappeared. My first thought was it was probably a firework, however there was no sound. No pop or whistle. It was probably a large piece of space junk reentering the Earth's atmosphere, But I thought it was worth reporting.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
