It passed behind big buildings but was still there when I passed them.  Then after one more building it disappeared.  What was it?;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
two points of light traversing the west texas sky,  one seemingly in pursuit of the other;2005-05-17 22:30:00;20 secs;Two points of light traversing the west texas sky,  one seemingly in pursuit of the other. 5/17/05 It was a clear night and I was in our backyard at around 10:30 PM when I saw two objects, high in altitude, suddenly (emphasize suddenly and from out of nowhere) appear in the southeast sky at about 60 degrees and moving on a westerly heading.  One was a small, steady (not pulsing) pinpoint of light about the size and brightness of a mid- sized star and reddish- orange in color. The other was an extremely bright white light that was about five or six times larger than the orange light and it was very slowly pulsing on and off, but, not in the manner that a strobe light does and it was much more brilliant than any aircraft strobe I have ever seen.  The white light object was not directly behind the orange light, but, was off to the side and rear and obviously on track and/or seeming to be in pursuit of it. They were not close enough together to be mistaken as being a single object (unless it was an immense thing, thousands of feet long) and neither had conventional aircraft style multi- colored lights as are typically seen. They were both only single points of light as described.  After a few seconds, I got my senses and ran to the bedroom window and yelled for my wife to hurry and come see this and I continued to watch and did not lose sight of them. When she made it outside and I showed her, she said, What is that? and I told her that I didn't know, but, they were definitely not any kind of airplanes or jets. By that time the objects were in the west/southwest sky at about 40 degrees.  Then, just as quickly as it appeared, the white light completely vanished and the orange light continued trekking west until it went out of our sight. Neither seemed to make any manuevers to turn or change altitude. There were no audible sounds and I did not notice any other aircraft in the sky during that time, at least, not in the same viewing area.  Total time I would estimate at 18- 20 seconds.  A side note: About eight or ten minutes later, two large planes at moderate altitude, one in front of the other and with identical lighting flew directly overhead from the east on a due west heading. The lighting on them was not like commercial aircraft, but, they were assuredly conventional aircraft.  I thought the event was definitely spectacular and out of the ordinary. Would like to know if someone else witnessed and reported it.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
Slow flashing light;2005-06-04 02:00:00;few seconds;Slow flashing light I fell asleep on the couch while watching tv and when I woke up it was about 2 in the morning. So I went to go let the dog out before going to bed. While standing at the back door waiting for the dog to do her business I saw this light. It was flying kind of low and slow and flashing on and off really slow. It was really bright, it kind of reminded me of a flash on a camera. My back door faces west, so it looked like it was maybe out towards Dyess and was flying north. I watched it for a few seconds and it just stopped.  I see airplanes flying here at night since Dyess is here and my house is near an airport, but this wasn't like the lights on a regular plane. It was very weird.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
4 Round Orange Glowing Objects;2006-01-20 21:30:00;Few Seconds;4 Round Orange Glowing Objects This happened very briefly, was outside bringing the trash out when I looked up into the sky and saw this glowing orange circle which quickly turned into 3 other circles (so 4 total) they went downwards at an angle about 45 degree angle, the objects all appeared to be connected to each other, then quickly went out, didnt fade out went out like you would turn off a light switch. Then about 5 minutes later in the same area this bright orange circle appeared and quickly went out. This time it was only 1 circle. Saw nothing again after that.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
Strange lights in Abilene;2006-01-27 00:00:00;several minutes;Strange lights in Abilene Around midnight I started to get hungry and went out for food. The only places open at that time here are Taco Bell, Whataburger, and Wendy's.  Given my choices I went to Wendy's.  After goin thru the drive thru I stopped in the parking lot to put the straw in my drink. before I started again I checked down the road and saw several lights in the air.  I was about two miles from Dyess AFB at the time and thought it was a plane landing,   then I noticed the lights were all blinking and the pattern did not fit any aircraft I know of. They were all a very pure white color, I couldn't see any yellowing or blueing like aircraft or car lights.  I started watching it and saw the light reflecting off some trees under it, it appeared to be apporx. 15 feet off the treetops which were maybe 150 yards away from me.  After about 15 seconds of watching them blink they slid over to the SE about 100 yards  I estimate. the movement took a full 2 seconds.  There was no acceleration or deceleration, it moved and stopped.  After stopping it hovered and all lights went steady for a few seconds then all shut off at the same time. After they turned off I watched for a few more seconds to make sure they didn't come back then drove off.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
Two lights moving west to east;2008-01-06 22:00:00;10 seconds;Two lights moving west to east I saw two lights moving from the west to east on parallel courses then made a 90 degree right turn to the south and disappeared.    The lights were about as bright as a street light two to three miles away.  They did not appear to be focused lights. i.e. car headlights or airplane landing lights.  The lights were moving at a speed similar to that of the C-130 aircraft executing the VOR-A approach toward ABI (Abilene) airport.   The distance between lights would be similar to the ends of your fingers at arms length when making the Y sign in sign language.   There were no other aircraft in the area. This was a Sunday night and DYS (Dyess) AFB was not flying. This was two days prior to the events at Stephenville;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714

Bright Orange Lights in South East Sky around Abilene, TX;2010-03-31 20:30:00;2 Minutes;Bright Orange Lights in South East Sky around Abilene, TX There were many sightings other than mine that night.  Five lights in bright orange appearing in straight line, then 4 across horizontal, later they formed a triangle with just 3 lights...my wife witnessed them also.  The blogs were full of sightings at the same time...I pegged the site to be around Cottonwood, TX in Callahan County...I made this judgement call by reading other blogs, pulling out maps and pin pointing where I thought they were.  I am familiar with flares, afterburners, landing lights, etc... I live around Dyess Air Force Base and know nearly every military aircraft.  These lights were something I cannot explain...;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
2 red lights appear and disappear in the southeast skys over Abilene.;2010-10-07 22:35:00;5 Mins;2 red lights appear and disappear in the southeast skys over Abilene. I am a manager at a restaurant in Abilene, Texas. One of the other managers said for the past 2 nights he had been seeing strange lights in the sky above his house in Potosi, about 5 miles southeast of Abilene.  He called me at work on the night of October 7th, 2010 around 8:30 or so and told me to look outside. I went outside and looked southeast. I saw 2 red lights appear in the sky, hover stationary for 2 or 3 seconds and disappear. About 5 minutes later, my grill cook came outside to smoke a cigarette, he came over to stand next to me and saw the same exact thing happen again, in the same spot.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
High altitude light beams out of clouds in vertical pattern.;2012-12-15 21:40:00;15 minutes;High altitude light beams out of clouds in vertical pattern Observed a single light column absolutely vertical, begining about 3000 to 5000 feet above ground and into thin clouds up to estimated altitude of 10000 feet.  It looked like a spotlight from the ground but did not move.   Three aircrew observed it for another five minutes, and then additional beams appeared until five were seen.  The first beam was the brightest.   All observations were through night vision goggles and could not be seen with unaided vision.   The cloud layers were reported as 25000 broken.  The first beam varied in intensity and at times emitted a brighter glow from the middle.   The beams never moved, just faded out some but the first brighter beam remained until our line of flight placed the sightings behind the aircraft.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714

I noticed 2 dark yellow, amber colored, what I thought to be stars.  ((NUFORC Note:  Submitted by aviation specialist.  PD));2017-05-10 00:00:00;2 minutes;On 5/11/2017 South side of Abilene, Texas, after a pretty heavy storm between midnight and 1 am, I was driving south out of my apartments and noticed 2 dark yellow, amber colored, what I thought to be stars, and stopped to look at them and they began traveling north they may have been already but I noticed they were moving towards me (north at an incredible rate of speed, I am a licensed A&P mechanic, and my father is retired air force and a lead inspector for ((name deleted)) Airline, and I have never seen an aircraft with one light very small like a star, but a dark yellow orange color no strobe or any other lights,   I tried to take video, and was unable due to how small the lights were and how fast they were going I heard no sound before, as, or after they passed but they were low enough for clouds to obstruct them at one point.  One had a 2 second lead or so on the other they were kind of side by side but one following.   I am very close to Dyess AFB, which is to the west, but they did not veer left of go west just North and I lost sight within a minute the whole event lasted less than 2 minutes starting when they were out in front of me to the south and high and far enough to look like strange colored stars.  I would say closer to 1 minute for the event, that fast, no sound???;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
Star-like light that started bouncing in the air before disappearing;2019-08-14 01:00:00;30 seconds;star-like light that started bouncing in the air before disappearing I was driving on the highway heading south, and in the air kind of behind these apartments off of the highway there was a bright light that looked like a star but was a slight bit bigger and brighter, it had a light blue color to it.  it was floating there for a few seconds then it started “bouncing” up and down rapidly in the air and changing colors from light blue to red. it stopped bouncing and sat still for a few seconds before it disappeared.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
