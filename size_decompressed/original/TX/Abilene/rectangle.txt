This happens to me all my life.;2009-06-24 21:05:00;18 mins;This happens to me all my life. I went outside at round 9 pm and while looking at the moon that was in the west i notice a bright light close to the direction i was looking,it was moving slowly to the north west and changed color from a sun like light to a reddish pink then it just slow got dimmer and was gone. I notice a small air plane was coming in that same direction when the UFO left.  After the plane that look as if it was circling.  As soon as the plane went out of view the the next UFO was in the same spot as the first one and it was a little closer this time, i could see that it was square with brite lights coming from it and in side the light i could see black columns like pillars on a old Rome building. I t was floating slow in same direction as the first one and did the same thing as far as color and speed then just like the first one is just faded into nothing and mabe 10 secs after was that plane that was there a min ago, single propeller look dark grey or grayish green.  As it flu passed and out of site a third UFO in the same spot as the other two came it did the same things as the first two all this took about 20 Min's.;32.4348803571428;-99.7339745535714
