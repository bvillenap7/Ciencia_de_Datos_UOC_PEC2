The first UFO came from the south west heading east/orth east.  It came from the same area that the space station came from and was moving much faster then a satellite could move and was a bit brighter then a satellite.   Then under a clear sky it went dark then illuminated a bit kind of like a blink an then disappeared.  No aircraft I know of can move so fast.  Then amazed by this I started looking around and saw a shooting star.  Shortly after I witnessed a satellite.  Then while watching the satellite I noticed what I thought was a star blink or glew brighter then took off and was gone in a flash.   My mom witnessed both and her friend on the phone saw the first UFO as it was visible longer and the reason her friend also saw the first UFO was because we were watching the space station together.;29.2155051724137;-99.7924172413789
