I looked up and saw an object that reminded me of those high end cigar tubes made of bright aluminum.  There was a brighter flame of silver shooting out of the rear of the craft.  The shape of the flame as it exited the rear port expanded wider than the ship then came to a flickering point at its ending.   The ship was traveling from north/west towards south/east.  It seemed to be about 5 miles out at cloud level. I say cloud level because it would enter a cloud bank and I could still see the flame reflect off the near by clouds.  It would exit a bank of clouds move into a clear area. I stopped to watch it.   I took pictures with my phone, but, they were not clear. The video I took shows a small dot not a clear object. My first thought was that it was a nuclear missile.  Reason I say that, I lived in Orlando, Florida, for 20 years.  I saw many Canaveral rocket launches from Kennedy from Orlando.  The movement of ! the object was steady, not wobbly as in those old Flash Gordon movies. I read about the launching in Los Angeles and wondered if they traveled that far.;34.0383;-98.9114
