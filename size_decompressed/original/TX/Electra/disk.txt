Saw craft with bright clear light illuminating from portholes hovering over a field near our house;2004-07-15 23:45:00;15 minutes;Saw craft with bright clear light illuminating from portholes hovering over a field near our house I live in a rural area surrounded by acres of farmland.  I was leaving my home at 11:40 P.M. on a Thursday night to pick up my daughter from her father after their vacation.  It is very dark this time of night where we live 15 miles out into the country.  My eyes immediatly made contact with the only thing in the night sky hovering about 2 telephone poles high- if one were to guess- aproximately 100 yards from me.  I counted three port-hole type lights glowing.  I could see a vague outline of a craft above the lights.  I also noticed beams of light shining down from each individual porthole.  I was fear stricken because I have never seen anything like this before and I was alone.  I got in my car and headed for town.  I immediatly called my husband on my cell phone who was working. As I turned the corner,  I noticed it appeared to follow me.  As I passed the neighbors house on down the road, I saw it hover about 10 feet from their roof at which point the craft's lights turned a quick blue/red then a spinning purple all the while tilting at an odd angle.  I observed it all the way to town and it transformed back into the way I first witnessed it with the clear lights.  The craft made no sound that I could hear and also noted my cell phone nearly impossible to hold a connection with my husband.  That has never happoned since  I have talked to another individual who reports nearly the same sighting 15 miles from our home the next night about the same time.;34.0383;-98.9114
