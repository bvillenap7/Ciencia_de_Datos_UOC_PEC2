black noiseless craft changing from round to having two angles with aura traveling at steady speed from west to east.;2009-07-05 07:00:00;several minutes;black noiseless craft changing from round to having two angles with aura traveling at steady speed from west to east. A round black object was seen coming from the west traveling to the east at 7:00 AM. The object did not emit any sound and it changed shape form round to having two angles. It had a  halo-like ring around it. It was high up and traveling at a steady speed to the east. I ran following it briefly and then large oak trees obstructed my view for a couple of seconds and when I passed the trees the object was nowhere in sight. I am a 43 year old stay at home Mom. I was preparing for a morning jog when I sighted the craft. I had my earphones on and took them off when I realized what I was seeing was not an airplane nor a helicopter. That is when I detected that the object was not making any noise.;30.5044999999995;-97.820900000002
