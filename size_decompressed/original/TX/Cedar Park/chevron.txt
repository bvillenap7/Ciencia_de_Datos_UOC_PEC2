It flew over me at a commercial airplane speed.  I couldn't tell distance of course, but if it was traveling at my assumed speed then it was fairly low, less than 3000 feet.     It flew point first and made absolutely no sound.  I tracked it across about 20 degrees of sky directly overhead then lost sight of it.  It was just a shadow and the city lights are bright here.  Which is probably why I could see it at all.  The city lights might have been reflecting off of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
