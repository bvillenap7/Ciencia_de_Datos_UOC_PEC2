Greenish Fireball:  Cedar Park, TX.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable meteor, we suspect.  Video suggests a meteor to us.  PD));2012-02-01 19:55:00;35 seconds;Greenish Fireball:  Cedar Park, TX As my family and I were eating dinner, I looked out the window and saw a greenish fireball like object and I called everybody else to see it, so we huddled around the window.  Both my dad and brother were able to see it. I saw it for about 25-30 seconds, it had a neon greenish color, and seemed to be going West to East according to where the sun sets and rises.  The interesting thing about this was that this was not the first time Iâ€™ve seen this phenomenon my dad and I have actually seen this fireball like object around the fall of 2011 and it was going in the same direction.  This sighting took place on February 1, 2012 at around 7:55pm CST at Cedar Park TX.
