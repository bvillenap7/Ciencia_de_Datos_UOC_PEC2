Translucent triangle that was totally silent heading NW Cedar Park, TX.;2017-05-01 21:00:00;5-10 seconds;translucent triangle that was totally silent heading NW Cedar Park, TX. A friend and I were flying RC drones in the park (Quest Park, Cedar Park, TX. 78613).  When the sun went down we started to put everything away when we noticed the UFO.  The UFO looked like a translucent triangle that was totally silent.  It was traveling around 20mph about 100 feet in the air heading North West.

Silent, wide and barely visible boomerang shaped object flying west over leander at 2am;2019-09-24 02:00:00;7 seconds;Silent, wide and barely visible boomerang shaped object flying west over leander at 2am Stargazing around 2 in the morning when all of a sudden an object blocks the stars in the part of the sky im looking at, i refocus my eyes only to realize this is a large boomerang shaped craft that is just barely visible under the night sky, almost perfectly camouflaged, and is heading west from cedar park.  I would guess this was flying over leander from where I saw it.  It made absolutely no noise and was incredibly camouflaged in the night sky.  There was no light emitting from the craft, the only reason I could see the craft was because of the silhouetting of the light from the stars in the night sky. It was flying rather low so I was very shocked considering i'd just been watching a lot of other air traffic come into austin, but to my surprise when i checked flightradar24 after this sighting there was ZERO air traffic within a 150 mile radius.... I would also mention that this boomerang object was very wide, it reminded me of the b-2 stealth bomber in wingspan honestly, which definitely makes me think this is some military black project that I just witnessed, not something extra terrestrial.  Either way, when I saw it, i was incredibly spooked. Never seen an actual unexplainable UFO in my life before, i would consider myself a skeptic of sorts when it comes to that stuff, so I have to say i feel pretty shaken up after this experience.;30.5044999999995;-97.820900000002
