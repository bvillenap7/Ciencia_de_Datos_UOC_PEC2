Cigar Shaped Object Descending in the Direction of the Surface.;2013-09-09 12:34:00;5-8 seconds;Cigar Shaped Object Descending in the Direction of the Surface At 1234 hrs I went outside to have a cigarette on my front porch. As it is a somewhat cloud filled day I was looking up in the SSW area of the sky.  Today it is a puffy white cloud, with a deep blue sky.  As I was viewing the sky, looking at the perfect clouds and looking in between them, I noticed a object.  This object was descending directly towards the ground. It was easy to determine this as most aircraft traversing the sky would appear to be moving from North to Nourth or East to west or reverse.  This object was clearly dropping and not traversing or ascending. The gap between the clouds –as I place my hand towards the sky- was from my thumb tip to my index finger tip with my arm completely extended outward and upward.  The object was straight (like a missile) and was white or bright in color.  It appeared to be somewhat ribbed or sectioned (possibly marked but clearly not one solid blank piece).  It traveled through this “gap” in the clouds in about 5 seconds.  Due to there being large and extended clouds lower on the horizon from whence this object passed behind the second cloud (my thumb) I could not see it immerge on the other side. May not be anything, but I thought I would send a note.;30.5044999999995;-97.820900000002
