On the night of December 20, 2008, my dog needed to go outside.  While I was sitting in a chair on my patio the dog looked up, and I did also.  Flying overhead at a tremendous speed was a brilliant, white ball of light about the circumference of a hula hoop.  A basketball size would not be quite large enough.  It had come from the West over my house flying East at the same height of the wispy clouds above me.  I do not know how high that was.  In seconds it disappeared into the distance.  It was a clean, concise ball of light.  No vapor, or tail, or distortion. After it had disappeared, to my right in the sky was a small plane that was flying higher than the ball of light did. In a few more minutes a commercial jet plane came over my house and it seemed to be crawling in the sky compared to the speed of the earlier ball of light.  I am on the flight path of planes heading north from Bergstrom/Austin Airport, and I watch them often from my patio, and my dog is used to looking up at them.  I am still in awe at the speed and the brightness of the object I saw last night. I have witnessed the shuttle followed by the International Space Station come over my back yard and neither of them showed the same speed across my sky that this object did.   I was able much longer to see them cross my sight path.   This is an account as accurately and truthfully as I can relate.;30.5044999999995;-97.820900000002
Extremely bright light grew faint and stopped.;2016-08-25 22:15:00;3 minutes;Extremely bright light grew faint and stopped On August 25th I was outside looking at the stars in the clear spots between the clouds and also texting on my phone.  After sending a text I looked up and saw what appeared to be an extremely bright satellite heading north that I had not noticed before which was past the halfway point of its trajectory by the time I saw it, if it was traveling horizon to horizon.  I watched it drift a few degrees in the sky and it started to get faint to a brightness of a regular satellite or a star and I thought it would continue to the horizon but it stopped.  I watched this light stay in place for approximately 2 minutes until it was covered by a large group of passing clouds.;30.5044999999995;-97.820900000002
Two blue lights, one event moving east to west, and the other moving north to south.;2017-08-17 01:00:00;3 seconds;Two blue lights, one event moving east to west and the other moving north to south. I was sitting in my backyard at night and saw what I know wasn't an airplane, due to how slow it was moving,  I could only see lights.  The appearance of the type of light type was that of a filament bulb.  They would slowly appear instead of behaving as LED lights do.  They would fade, sometimes almost fade away but then slowly brighten up again, going from yellow to more of a red color, no sound.  I just assumed it was a weather balloon but I didn't see much information about those having lights on them unless they were in a busy air traffic area.   About 10 minutes after that, moving east to west was what I can only describe as having a lightning bug-like behavior.  I'm an amateur entomologist and know they don't fly that high, it was way above the trees (so it appeared to be), I was looking north.   The light lasted about 3 to 5 times longer than the typical length of time a firefly brightens up.  It wasn't a comet, much too slow going east to west then rose slightly and wasn't visible anymore.  Then it happened again going north to south about 10 minutes later.   The way it behaved, the speed, I just can't describe it.  It could have been around 200ft above the ground, small, moving like a fast flying moth.  Very similar to what it might look like if somebody put a blue LED light on a drone and flew it over your backyard at night, but completely silent.;30.5044999999995;-97.820900000002
