Flashing lights (1 red 2 green) with whirring sound, stopped, then changed direction, then went down towards the earth.;2014-12-07 19:40:00;a few minutes;Flashing lights (1 red 2 green) with whirring sound, stopped, then changed direction, then went down towards the earth Walking the dog and I hear a whirring sound above.  Looked up and saw three distinct lights close to each other moving at normal aircraft speed 2 green lights and 1 red light.  The green lights were flashing in unison.   The object stopped for about 5-10 seconds (no wobbling observed) the proceeded at a 120 deg direction from where it was.  No turning was observed.  This is when I paid attention cause even a helicopter would've shown some sort of a turning movement.   Then it stopped again. and started going down in a vertical steady movement until I was behind the trees and I could not see it.  A few minutes later (I am now at a different location since I was walking the dog) I looked back to see the object in the air again.  Same green lights flashing and a steady red light.  I took a quick (read bad) video of it with my cell phone.  Then it went down again until it disappeared behind the trees again. This is what it looked like O O  the two light on top flashing green O   This single light was steady red. Did not see any structure between the lights as it was dark but the lights did not vary distance between each other.  Like they were connected somehow.
