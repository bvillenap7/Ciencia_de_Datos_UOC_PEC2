Round brightly lit  object moving slow and low.;2013-06-24 22:03:00;3 minutes;Round brightly lit  object moving slow and low. My husband and I saw a round brightly lit object moving west to east at 10:03 pm.  It appeared very low and moving slowly.  We know that it was not a plane or helicopter.  It being so low and brightly lit was what was so odd about it.   We are in our sixties and still have good vision.  We are retired professionals and we do not drink.   It took about 3 minutes to cross the sky before it faded out.  We first noticed it close to the handle of the big dipper.  thank you.;30.7436;-98.0509000000001
