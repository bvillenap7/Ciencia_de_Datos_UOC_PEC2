Egg shapped craft, leaving trail of spider web like material;2002-10-29 12:00:00;30 min;Egg shapped craft, leaving trail of spider web like material On 10/29/02 my wife and I were sitting out side at 12 noon. I am a pilot and my wife and I had just returned from a flight. I heard the sound of a helicopter near by and looked up the check the type and location of this aircraft when I spotted a brilliant white egg shaped craft traveling at a high rate of speed going from east to west. I would guess the altitude to be at or about 5,000 feet. There was no sound associated with the passage of this craft and I would guess the speed to be just barely below the speed of sound. Shortly after the passage of this craft the sky was filled with white plastic threads, some of which were clumped together. Most of this material disintegrated upon contact with the ground. This event lasted for about 30 minutes. I have a sample of this material and will gladly send it to any credible person or agency to be analyzed.
