oval slow moving craft;2005-06-13 21:45:00;5 mins.;oval slow moving craft i was outside walking my dog and i noticed a white to orangish oval craft approaching from the west. the craft was glowing  but not extremely bright. it was  moving slowly,just gliding along above the tree tops ,maybe 500 feet?? when it got close to the city water tower it became dimmer. i only saw it a few seconds after that and it was gone. this has made me a little nervous. also it made no sound.;30.7436;-98.0509000000001
