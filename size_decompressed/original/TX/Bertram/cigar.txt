cigar or pencil shaped craft changes position over landed  emergency helicoper in daylight.;2005-08-11 19:00:00;3 to 5 minutes;cigar or pencil shaped craft changes position over landed  emergency helicoper in daylight. i was in my backyard and i heard a helicopter flying overhead and i saw it was star-flight(emergency hospital transport). i went to my back fence to see where they would land and it was right off hwy 29,so some of the side road was closed off by police. there were alot of people at the scene and i am just guessing a auto accident.i was almost ready to in my house and i noticed a white long pencil thin object floating slowly over the top of all of this. when i first noticed it was horizontal,but as it was directly above the helicoter(which is on the ground)it just gently changed to vertical and silently went out of sight. i quickly came out of my yard to see if anyone else had seen it. i asked a few people if they had seen that thing flying over.... but no one had. i decided i would just not say anything else. later that night at approx. 9,15 pm two huge helicopers went right over our little town heading southwest. the helicopters looked military with two propellers  on top. maybe not even related?? since june i have noticed alot of unusual things which are not normal. thanks;30.7436;-98.0509000000001
