Triangle lights.;1998-03-15 19:00:00;30 minutes;Triangle lights. I was in my way home from work about 7pm, I had just turned onto my road off of hwy271 when my attention was drawn to bright white lights in the sky.  There were three vey bright lights and in between those were three dim white lights.  I watched these lights for a few seconds and then they shot across the sky faster than anything I’ve ever seen, and disappeared!   When I came back to my senses I was sitting in my driveway and it was almost 8pm.  I lost almost an hour of time!  My home was only about 4 miles down the road!   I am a military veteran and servers for almost 10 years, I almost didn’t share this but thought it might be relavent to someone else’s story!
