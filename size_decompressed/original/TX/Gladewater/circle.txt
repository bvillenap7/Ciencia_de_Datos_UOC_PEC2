At approximately 1:15 AM (CST), five individuals spotted a round ball approximately a football field's distance above the trees moving in a N-NE direction on Post Street, between Highway 80 and Gay Avenue.  The ball was seen as white, orange, green, and brown before it disappeared approximately 4 seconds after being spotted. The object flew in a straight line across the sky.  After the object disappeared, we looked towards the moon and saw a trail of smoke drifting across it in the same direction as the object was moving when we saw it.;32.5575;-94.9376
