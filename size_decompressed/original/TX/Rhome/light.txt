An extremely bright round object.;2019-12-15 00:20:00;1 minutes;An extremely bright round object.  As me and two relatives drove north on 287 from Haslet.  While driving a Circular and definitely way Brighter than any star I've seen grabbed all of our attention.  It was up high on the left (west) side of the fwy.  It looked like a star was falling at a fast speed then the round light seemed to have control again and started going up.  The space craft seemed to do what it seemed to me like between a J and a U then dissapeared towards the end of the J to an extremely high speed away to what I believe was west but then dissapeared. We have never experienced anything like it or have seen something so bazaar or so quick. Our radio also went a bit staticky but wasn't sure if it was just a coincidence.;33.0579;-97.4803
