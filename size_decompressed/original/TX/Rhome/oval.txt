Low flying craft with large shadow;2012-07-21 10:30:00;5 seconds max;Low flying craft with large shadow Driving three miles north of Rhome (between Rhome and Decatur) Texas on 287.  Saw a large shadow of a craft flying very low and very fast across the highway and it flew directly over the front of my truck.   This incident caused me to swerve to where I almost lost control of my truck and could have easily gone off the road.  This was unlike anything I have ever seen.  After this happened, all of my electronics went haywire.  The batteries in my truck died and would not charge with a jump, my cell phone stopped working and will not turn on and it is fairly new, and my laptop computer will not turn on, nor will it hold a charge.  I cannot explain what flew over the front of my truck but whatever it was, has ended up costing me a lot of money to replace all of my electronics.;33.0579;-97.4803
