At that point, it was just a light moving in a straight path in the sky.  We live an hour North of Dallas and very close to a local small airport and see aircraft frequently.  The aircraft I was following was traveling from the NW to the SE when I noticed a bright flash (like a camera flash) off to the left of the object I was tracking.  Then off to the right of the object about a minute later, another flash, but no object observed. As I continued to visually track the object I thought was an aircraft, it suddenly made a sharp left turn in an arc like an aircraft might do, but it seemed to turn upward and rapidly disappeared out of sight.  Mush faster than an aircraft might do based on the distance I thought it was from my observation point. The next day my wife and I observed some discolored grass in our yard not noticed before.  We noticed a pattern of 5 spots in a pentagon shape about 2 ft in circumference spaced equally apart and one spot off to the side.  I tried to think of something I might have had on the lawn that weekend and cannot recall placing anything on the lawn that would discolor the grass like that.;33.6296;-97.2202
