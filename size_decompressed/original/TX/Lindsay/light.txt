Saw a what looked lik a star moving all around faster than any human carft could.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2009-08-27 23:10:00;over 3 hours;Saw a what looked lik a star moving all around faster than any human carft could would occasionall split into 2 then 1 would disappear. I saw what appeared to be a star moving across the sky at a consistent speed faster than that of any human aircraft.  A plane happened to fly by in the direction of the moving object, that appeared to be a ways off in space, and the plane was much slower than this UFO and I could hear the plane but not the UFO.  It did not move in a pattern but very swiftly back and forth, in circles, and just around in general.  The UFO stayed in the same area of the sky between Jupiter and the North Star around the little dipper in the south west at about a 30 degree angle of elevation.  Would split off in two occasionally and would disappear for a second or two then reappear.  It lasted for over 3 hours. ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));33.6296;-97.2202
