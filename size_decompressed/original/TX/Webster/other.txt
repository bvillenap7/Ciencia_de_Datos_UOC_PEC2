A Vertical Phenomena Vector.;2015-02-01 18:00:00;15 seconds;a Vertical Phenomena Vector Wife and I observed a light streak which looked similar to the star trek transporter…(that’s the best description I can give)  approximately 10 foot in length.. Vertically positioned.  Elevation 50 yards high.   Movement initiated from top then moved down.  The emitting light was silver with a shimmering ball coming down in middle of two parallel lighted lines.  Sounds crazy but we saw this.   Location was on Interstate 45 southbound …the light appeared approximate a 100 yards in front of us as we were driving on the freeway.  We both saw this.    I then saw this again from the backyard of my home.  I live by Ellington Field Airport.   Duration of this was 15 seconds, then it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));29.551;-95.1435
