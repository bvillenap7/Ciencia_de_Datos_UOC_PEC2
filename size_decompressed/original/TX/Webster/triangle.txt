I was in the passenger side front seat. We were not too far from the Johnson Space center. I happened to look up and saw this Triangular craft approximately 2 or 3 thousand feet high. . To me it looked like a equilateral triangle. It appeared quite large but was difficult to estimate. It was black or almost dark grayish in color> It hovered for a short length of time then took off with such speed it was out of sight like a light turned on and off. The skie was fairly clear with a few scattrered clouds.;29.551;-95.1435
