Blinking white light and red.;2010-10-13 03:00:00;2 minutes;Blinking white light and red. Don't know if this was a UFO but it was traveling in a straight line when it passed over me and it was real high all I could see was blinking lights then it just vanished there was no sound at all it was traveling in a north east direction.   To be honest don't know if it was a jet and I don't know or think planes travel over this area at this time. Just reporting what I saw.
