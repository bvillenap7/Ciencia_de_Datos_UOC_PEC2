Unusual object flying low at a slow speed;2002-01-12 13:45:00;11minutes;Unusual object flying low at a slow speed On January 12 on my way home from town as I was fixing to enter the community I live in something caught my attention. First, it was a flock of ducks flying southeast and as I looked at the ducks, another object caught my attention. It was a white object I thougt it was an airplane from one of the private airports around here but it didn't have an airplane shape nor did it make any sound.  I hurried home and grabbed my binoculars to have a better look at the object.  What I saw had no wings or propellers. Instead it had what appeared to be a black stripe of some sort or maybe a narrow window.  For a minute I thought it could've of been a remote control plane like the ones the airforce is using in Afghanistan, but I observed the object moving at a slow speed as if it were floating in place. I thought about calling the AFB to verify if they had picked up anything unusual flying around.  I watched it for about 11 minutes and then it diminished away...;32.4472290824258;-97.7342688958003
One saucer in the sky, late at night.;2008-10-27 22:45:00;Fourty five seconds;One saucer in the sky, late at night. My friend and I were walking late at night outside of his home, and as we reached the near end of our walk we looked up and viewed a UFO in the sky.  We both asked if the other had seen what we thought we'd seen, agreed, and headed home.  The craft itself was in the shape of a disk, it had eight lights on the bottom part of it.  The crafts upper part was a gray color, and the bottom part with the lights appeared to be black.  (It was late at night so it might be another color, but I was unable to see what it was).  The experience wasn't very long, the craft moved to the right from it's original position, made a small circle, moved left, then seemed to disappear.;32.4472290824258;-97.7342688958003
