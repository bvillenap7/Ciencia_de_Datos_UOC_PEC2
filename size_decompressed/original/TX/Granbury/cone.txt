Unknown object in the west north sky after sundown.;2016-10-11 19:30:00;30-45 minutes;Unknown object in the west north sky after sundown. I reside in Granbury, TX.  This evening, about 1930 hours, as I went to retrieve my flag, I was looking off to the west northwest and observed an object in the sky.  Low on the horizon. Didn’t think too much of it, but on closer inspection I noticed it had a trailing portion to the object.  As I continued to watch the object it appeared to be relatively stationary. I went inside my home and retrieved a spotting scope I had and focused in on the object. Still appeared stationary.  It had an obvious tailing apart from the frontal portion of the object.  It appeared to continue to be stationary but due to the rotation of the Earth in was on a downward trajectory relative to the night sky and my position.  It did not appear to be lessening in intensity at all. That is all I can report as I’m obviously not very technical in my description. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and serious-minded.  We asked whether the object might have been a twinkling star, and he stated that it was not.  PD));32.4472290824258;-97.7342688958003
