Having 4m miles of air travel...it was no plane. I'm also retired Aerospace - and know of no experimental a/c that could do that. It had a slightly greenish glow. Never seen anything like it.  There was a commercial a/c off in the NE distance that might have seen this...looked like it was heading into DFW. I have no images...was all too fast.;32.4472290824258;-97.7342688958003
