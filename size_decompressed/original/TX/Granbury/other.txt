It was shaped funny and vannished.;2004-05-04 14:23:00;20 secs;It was shaped funny and vannished. I was driving from Ft Worth to Granbury on hwy 377. I was almost to Granbury when I Noticed a Flying object. I thought it was odd looking and didn't look like a plane so I kept looking out my driver window,then look at the road, then back, it went on for about 20 secs or so.I was starting to conclude that this wasn't an ordinary old plane.I turned from the road to look again and it was completely gone.  This object had a cylinder front with a larger cylinder back, It was flying at a upward direction . It was infront of me but a few miles off to the side.It was flying north. This was a strange event due to it vanished and was a very clear sunny day.  It was a dull silver color .  I hope this helps.;32.4472290824258;-97.7342688958003
