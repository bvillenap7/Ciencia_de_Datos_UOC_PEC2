First we saw an object we believed to be a satellite although orange in color pass in a straight orbit from behind us onward.   Then we noticed a second object directly in the sky to our left orbit across the sky also in a straight line.  This time we were a little more suspicious of the object and the previous object due to the quick speed they both seemed to be orbiting at.   Within another two or three minutes another object was spotted directly in from of our like of version first orbiting to the right, but when I pointed it out to my mother physically using hand gestures, it suddenly changed course and began orbiting to the left where it was originally spotted, then it vanished out of the sky.   After about six to ten minutes another object was spotted directly above our line of view began orbiting in a straight orbit heading in the direction behind us.! All of the objects looked exactly the same physically. Orange, satellite sized objects moving very quickly.;29.4915;-99.7108
