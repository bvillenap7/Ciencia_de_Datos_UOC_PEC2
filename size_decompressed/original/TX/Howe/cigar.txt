Silver, silent, stationary cigar object;1990-09-15 07:30:00;10 mins;Silver, silent, stationary cigar object Walking south on hwy 5 north of FM 290, I saw a silver, smooth, cigar shaped object just beneath the rising sun.  It was shifted to the left of the sun and just beneath.  It seemed to be as wide as the sun, but closer. It was huge and silent.  I thought it was on optical illusion from the sun rise, but it did not move with the sun.  The sky was clear, no clouds that I recall. I was disturbed and looked away.  I looked back in 10 minutes or so, and the object was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.529;-96.6737
