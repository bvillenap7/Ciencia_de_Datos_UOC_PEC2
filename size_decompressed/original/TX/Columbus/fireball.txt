Only it sorta dashed across like so ----- then it was gone. Seen lots of shooting stars but never one that ----- across the sky. Had just finished delivering a load of gas at the Texaco station in Columbus Tx, and was heading back to the rack in Houston when my attention was caught by a green fireball sorta streaking or rather skipping across the sky. Never seen one do that before so I thought I report it to you.;29.695;-96.5524
