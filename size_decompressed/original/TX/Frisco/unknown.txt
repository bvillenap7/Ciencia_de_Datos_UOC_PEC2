Rocket like object lights up sky as it streaks across North Texas sky.;2002-01-31 22:00:00;10-15 seconds;Rocket like object lights up sky as it streaks across North Texas sky. Aprox 10:00PM Central time my wife and I witnessed a bright (bluish-white) afterburner like streak of light traveling north to south over NE Dallas Texas heading toward Houston. Aprox altitude was 10,000 to 20,000 feet with a speed over 500mph. Trajectory was like that of a rocket. No sound or structure was heard nor seen. Sky condition: CAVU Called Air Traffic Control (Fort Worth Center), they had a number of calls concerning the object. They have no idea what it was other than possibly a satellite returning to earth. ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports for this event.  We spoke with this witness, a commercial airline pilot, and found him quite credible.  He said that the object was not consistent with any type of aircraft that he is familiar with.  He estimated the altitude of the object at many tens of thousands of feet, or higher.
