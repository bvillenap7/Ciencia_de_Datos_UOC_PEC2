White light speeds out of existence;2011-11-10 21:30:00;several seconds;White light speeds out of existence I was driving South on Preston road in Frisco, Texas, on my way to a game store for a midnight release for a new video game.  I left my house at about 9:21 and got to the store about 10 minutes later. On my drive to the store,  I was nearing the top of a hill and could only see a few stars in the sky.   As I was driving, a bright white light appeared far above me and was moving extremely fast in a straight line.  In the time that it took for me to realize it was there and then actually looking at/focusing on it, the light curved upward and disappeared.   It was going on a curved path upwards, and I could no longer see the object.  It was a bright, full moon that night as well.;33.147842175957;-96.7762992612496
Large and unusual light observed in the evening sky just southwest of Frisco, Texas...;2015-02-01 18:25:00;3:00;Large and unusual light observed in the evening sky just southwest of Frisco, Texas... I was headed south on Preston Road, about 2 and a half miles north of Frisco, Texas when I observed a bright light in the sky, southwest of Frisco, Texas, with a cloud as a backdrop.  The light was white gold in color, and looked to be at two levels, top and bottom.  It was dusk, but the Sun was still low on the horizon, and thought at first the light might be a reflection of the Sun on an aircraft approaching DFW Airport, which is relatively nearby. I became convinced that the light was not an aircraft or helicopter.  It seemed much too big, like a sudden star in the sky.  Besides, living where I do on the north side of the Metroplex, I see airplanes and helicopters flying overhead all of the time.  I know them by sight, but what I saw this evening didn't resemble a plane or copter at all. The light stayed in one place, backed by the cloud, for almost two minutes, then rose above the cloud, in a straight line and much faster than a plane or copter could, for about five seconds.  The light then completely disappeared, in the blink of an eye.  The Sun was still visible, so if what I saw was some kind of reflection off of the sun, it would NOT have disappeared as it did. I looked in all directions from the light, for several minutes, but I did not see the light any further after it disappeared.;33.147842175957;-96.7762992612496
4 orange glowing lights flying in single row formation.  ((Starlink satellites??));2021-02-01 18:50:00;1-2 min;4 orange glowing lights flying in single row formation On 2/1/2021 my daughter and I were driving west on Veneto Dr in Frisco TX when we saw 4 orange glowing lights in a single row formation in the sky coming from the NE. The lights were fast moving but also hovered at times. We pulled over on the residential street. I noticed a white suv had pulled over behind us. A man and his son were playing basketball outside their home and they had stopped and were also observing. The lights were low flying. There was a smaller airplane flying towards us coming from the SW in the distance but he was flying a much higher altitude than the unexplained lights. We got out of the car to view them. Just as the lights got directly in front of us, they begin to vanish one by one starting with the one in the lead, then the 2nd, 3rd and 4th. I yelled to the suv behind us “did you see that”? A woman yelled back “yes, there were 4 of them”. I asked her what was it and she replied UFO’s. I didn’t get to speak to the man and boy who were also watching. These were not planes, helicopters or anything I’ve ever seen in the sky. We are still trying to process what we saw. We did not record or take pictures because we were too stunned by what we were seeing.;33.147842175957;-96.7762992612496
