Two glowing light green oblong/cigar shaped objects side-by-side;2007-08-03 08:20:00;8 seconds;Driving into work in Frisco, TX on Spring Creek Parkway this morning at around 8:20 AM something caught my eye in the sky.  There were no clouds in the sky and was completely sunny.  I looked up and saw two glowing light green oblong/cigar shaped objects side-by-side flying in the sky that looked as though they were either flying away from me or actually falling from the sky.  They were moving faster than I have ever seen anything in the sky move.  As I continued to watch them for around 8 seconds or so they vanished.;33.147842175957;-96.7762992612496

My dog ran over to me, and it knew that something wasn't right.   I looked outside the window and there were white lights flashing in a straight line, one right after another,  it was cloudy, but I could count four lights.  They were slowly moving over the house.   I called my husband, and he too saw them.   They slowly started disappearing as they moved higher and away from our house. Then it became silent, and it was gone.
