Flashing orange lights above the clouds in Texas.;2016-09-16 21:00:00;Unknown;Flashing orange lights above the clouds in Texas. My brother and I were driving home from dinner in Frisco and saw flashes of orange above the clouds to the northeast.  It was very odd because there weren't clouds anywhere else except in that direction. My brother initially thought it was distant fireworks, but we quickly agreed that the flashing was appearing far too high in the sky to be that.  It basically looked like constant lightning above the clouds for the entire drive home.  There was no rain at all in the vicinity and the color of the light was orange.;33.147842175957;-96.7762992612496
