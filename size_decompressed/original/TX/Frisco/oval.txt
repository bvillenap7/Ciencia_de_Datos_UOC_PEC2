Large, un-lit, object moves silently and slowly through the cloudy skies over Frisco, TX.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-10 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;Large, un-lit, object moves silently and slowly through the cloudy skies over Frisco, TX. I went out to my deck and looked for the North Star.  I was lining up the big dipper to find it, when I saw a very large, slow moving object.  It was about 2,000 feet above me and moving silently to the north.   It had to have had the dimensions of a football field.  It was tapered toward the front and had no lighting whatsoever.  It appeared gray against the cloudy night sky and had a smooth exterior that contained detail of some kind...windows, equipment...I couldn't tell.   As it moved further on, I could tell that it had some thickness to it and was flattened off at the back end.  It just kept moving at a slow but steady clip until it disappeared into the clouds.  The only person I have told is my wife.  She said she believed me, but didn't want to talk about it anymore.  Now, I know why people don't talk about this type of thing.  There is a real stigma attached to it.   Who is going to believe me anyway? ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
