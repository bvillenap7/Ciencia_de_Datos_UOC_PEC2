Triangle, moving south from the north, not moving very fast,  I was completely sober and my wife saw it too.;2003-09-27 23:15:00;4 to 5 minutes;Triangle, moving south from the north, not moving very fast,  I was completely sober and my wife saw it too. Tonight at about 2315, my wife and I saw a triangle-shaped ufo flying in a southerly direction just west of Frisco, TX. There was no sound coming from it at all and it did not seem to be moving very fast but fast enough to be gone when I tried to find our camcorder. It had lights that just seemed to glow, not beam like a normal aircraft. There were 10 or 12 lights on this object.  This was a ufo. I spent time in the navy working on aircraft on the flightdeck of the USS Eisenhower and have seen planes flying in formation at night, and this was definitely not normal aircraft.  I guarantee you that I am not the only one that saw this. You will probably get other emails about this too.;33.147842175957;-96.7762992612496
Triangle shaped object with white lights entered and exited atmosphere.;2014-06-30 05:45:00;10-20 seconds;Triangle shaped object with white lights entered and exited atmosphere. My husband and I were traveling south on highway 121 headed to work.  A triangle with white lights at each point appeared high in the horizon.  The object moved in a forward motion while the lights alternated around the points.  I would say it was in our atmosphere for 5-10 seconds.  We both observed it and then it shot off and was gone.;33.147842175957;-96.7762992612496

((NUFORC Note:  We have requested from the witness more, and more-detailed, information about the alleged sighting event.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It was like a B2 bomber, but more rounded edges.  It was white, but very dim, almost looked like a cloud out of the corner of my eye, but as it passed over, I could make out shape.  It was moving to fast to get a decent look at details, the thing that really got me was the lack of sound.  It was completely silent.  I have been around air planes all my life and seeing something move that fast, i was expecting some kind of engine noise.  I verified that the wind was blowing south at 2 mph and this was heading north at an incredible speed.  Hope this explains a little better and please let me know if you have any follow up questions!
