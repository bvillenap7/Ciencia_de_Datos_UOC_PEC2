Wierd light in the night sky vanishes like someone turned off the light switch.;2005-08-14 20:45:00;2 Min;Wierd light in the night sky vanishes like someone turned off the light switch. On a clear black night my uncle and I were working on my swimming pool and we were taking a break and I was picking up my vacuum. My uncle told me that he was wishing on the first he saw in the sky,  after a couple of seconds he started watching it closer, it was moving very slow. I then saw it and started talking to him about it. It was like a star only a little off color and it was moving, I knew it was moving because we were fixed with a tree line and saw that it was moving closer.  When I went to grab a chair and sit down, (My uncle still fixed to the light) I told him to grab a chair and we will see together. within a matter of a split second that I and my uncle turned to sit down it vanished as if they were watching us.  I had a very bright flood light shining toward the direct of the light so maybe they noticed us. Maybe.;28.4222;-97.7616000000001
