I was abducted and I can remember the happenings, I just cant remember what they want.;1996-08-15 03:00:00;two to three hours;I was abducted and I can remember the happenings, I just cant remember what they want. About two or three in the morning I awoke on the top bumk of my bed to see a bright light outside of my room. Peering out of the blinds I remember a feeling of..total peace.  Next thing I know I am sitting in a comfortable chair, much opposed to the normal sayings of ' cold room, bright lights, metallic objects '. I was, in my thoughts, in the cockpit of the object I was in, slowly being surrounded by beings I couldnt make out.  Now, I know the sayings of sceptics of R.E.M. sleep and how coming out of it you are paralyzed, yet slightly aware of objects around you, yet making thes objects out to be blurry beings or distorted images, but I have had this happen to me bofore and I know the feeling.  I have had nothing like this happen to me in my life, and I just needed to get it out.  Belive me or not, things are out there, and I know what they want. I just cant remember.
