I saw this bright orange light rise up over the trees.  It rose pretty quickly.;2018-01-06 18:34:00;1 minute;I was standing outside of my car in Brookshire, Texas, at approximately 6:34 PM on Saturday, January 6th.  I happened to be looking towards the east when I saw this bright orange light rise up over the trees.  It rose pretty quickly.  It appeared to be coming from the area of Hovas Park. It rose straight up and then proceeded to travel to the West/Northwest at about the speed of a news helicopter.  Since this was a Saturday I knew it was not a news helicopter or any other chopper for that matter.  They are rare in this isolated area. At first I assumed it was small drone.  However, having experience with flying drones, I expected the familiar drone sound but the light/object was completely silent.  Drones are very noisy. It flew right over me.  It was probably about 300 feet in the air but it was hard to tell given that it was very dark, although the sun had just set. The light was colored between orange and yellow. Size was difficult to determine as it was just a ball of light.  I could not really make out a shape or form.  I thought about running inside for my binoculars but did not do so because the object would have been gone by the time of my return. The entire sighting lasted about 60 seconds. The weather was clear and very little breeze.  There was the faintest hint of the setting sun but it was still very dark, almost night time.  There was no alcohol or other mind altering substances involved.;29.8072;-95.9755
