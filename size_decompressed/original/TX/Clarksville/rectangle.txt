I suddenly saw this huge bright object and I knew it was not a planet,  coming from the north and as it got closer, I could tell it was a rectangular shape as it had multicolored lights all around it and one solid green light underneath.  All of a sudden it stopped and a few seconds later probably 10, a second object which looked to be like the same as the other one pulled up beside it and there was a red beam of light, looking like a laser but much wider projected to the first object for another 20 to 30 seconds and then it retracted. About 20 more seconds the first object started moving south and then made a quick left and accelerated at a fast speed going east and then it just disappeared. The second object still hovering so to speak, rose upwards, turned and headed back in a north direction from where it came and also suddenly disappeared. This was very strange indeed and I never saw anything like it before and I still wonder just what was that red laser beam of light was and if they were transferring something or repairing something.  Both objects were, I perceive to be of a vast size.  I can't believe, no one else did not see these things.  I do not drink or do drugs and my mind was clear as a bell!.  However, now my mind is pondering on what I saw. Thank you for your time in listening to my sighting of two objects which I do believe were not of this world, but I suppose it could be anyone's guess or speculation.;33.6238;-95.0456
