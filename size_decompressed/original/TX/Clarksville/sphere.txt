Objects make transfer in night skies ?;2004-05-06 21:00:00;10 minutes;Objects make transfer in night skies ? On the evening of May 6, 2004, I was coming home from Paris, Texas to my home north of Clarksville, Texas on FM Road 1495 around 9 pm.  I pulled off of the side of the road to check my headlights on my car as I thought one of them had burned out.  It turned out that that was not the case, both were working properly. I just so happened to turn around and look into the eastern sky and saw what I thought was a planet or star shining real bright...then I realised that it was moving due west. All of a sudden, it stopped it's progress entirely. Then, from the north came another bright object and it pulled close to the other object and you could tell there was a space between the two objects. While both objects were stopped, a red beam came from the north object as if touching the other object for what I observed was for 5 minutes. Then the red beam retracted and the first object started a slow forward movement westward and then all of a sudden it shot out of sight at a tremendous speed and dissapeared and the second object turned and went in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed and vanished.  I do not know, what these objects were, but it was interesting to watch them.  I have thought about them often since that night.;33.6238;-95.0456
