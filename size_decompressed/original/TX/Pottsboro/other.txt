white snake-like figure moving fluidly through the clouds.;2000-09-01 08:00:00;5 mins;white snake-like figure moving fluidly through the clouds. My brother and I were on our way to school one morning when something in the sky caught my eye. A seemingly large snake-like figure was moving fluidly through the clouds. I pointed it out to my brother and asked him if i was seeing things. He was shocked at the site he too saw a snake-like figure. The figure seemed to be at about the same altitude as an airliner but it was clearly not. The sighting lasted the whole commute to school.
