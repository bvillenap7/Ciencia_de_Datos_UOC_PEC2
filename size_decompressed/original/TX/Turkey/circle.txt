a bunch of small silver ones and one big black triangle;2000-08-01 13:00:00;all day;a bunch of small silver ones and one big black triangle a shiny object caught my eye so i looked. and 1st dismissed it as a weather balloon but there was another and another and another for as far as my eyes could see. they were round but underneath it was smaller. at another time same area my boyfriend and his best friend had a black triangle hover over them with triangle lights. they were terrified and never returned to the hunting and fishing lease. all this happened within a month. the shiney ones were still there when i left the lease laid out on what looked like a grid formation.;34.4036;-100.8449
