eye in the sky;2004-06-26 19:00:00;unknown;eye in the sky On June 26 about 8pm my wife and iI were tending our garden here in west Texas. I noticed a strange Bubbly looking cloud off to the north westThis cloud looked like it was boiling at the bottem margin of the cloud. I decided that I would go in and get my new Digital Camera a get a couple of shots of this cloud .When I got back most of the bubbling effect of this cloud was gone, and a large grey mass of cloud had taken ite place.I then took several shots in normal auto camera mode,and for some reason the pictures were whited-out,and I thought how strange.The camera is brand new and takes near perfect pictures. I now decided to put the camera on niteshot, witch in daylight should whiteout the pics.This is late june and it doesn't get dark till around 9pm.The pics didn't white-out,There are several oval imiges  on the 4 shots i took that could not be seen with the naked eye.Some you can actually see sunlight reflecting off of. When my Wife saw these pictures after I downloaded them onto the computer she said the hair on the back of her neck stood on end.;32.8567;-100.4722
