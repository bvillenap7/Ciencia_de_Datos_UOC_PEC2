Orange flickering light northwest of Houston observed from Highway 290;2008-07-03 22:01:00;30 seconds;Orange flickering light northwest of Houston observed from Highway 290 While driving northwest on highway 290, I observed an orange light directly ahead of me, high up and flickering as if it were a flame.   It moved slowly toward the northeast, and though I was driving near 70, I didn’t seem to get any closer.  It took a slow turn toward the southeast, parallel to 290.   The roof of my car began to obscure it, and I had to lean forward and look to the right to keep it in view, glancing every few seconds at the road to keep from swerving.  During one of these glances, the object either disappeared or darted off.   The whole even lasted maybe 30 seconds.;29.9285955128205;-95.6660801282055
Bright stationary disc of light in pre-dawn;2017-05-10 05:15:00;3 minutes;Bright stationary disc of light in pre-dawn I get up early for work, and it is not unusual to take the dog out before daybreak.  On May 10, I was outside with the dog at 5:15 am, waiting for her to finish up so I could get ready for work.  I was looking at the sky to see what stars I could identify, but there were scattered clouds so I didn’t see many.  I realized there was a very bright light behind one group of clouds and thought to myself that the moon was extremely bright.  The clouds were low and as they moved past the bright light, what I originally thought was the glow of the moon was not the moon after all. I didn’t see any definitive shape, just a very bright light, like a spotlight, and I thought it must be a helicopter.  It definitely wasn’t an airplane--it didn’t move.  Then I realized for a spotlight to be that bright and that large, I should hear some sort of sound. While we do live a couple of miles from a freeway, at that hour of the morning, there is very little noise in the neighborhood.  This morning was no different, and this was no helicopter. I looked out at the yard to see where the dog was then looked back at the sky—no more than 5-6 seconds had lapsed--and the light was gone.;29.9285955128205;-95.6660801282055
4 orange lights smoothly floating in the clear sky effortlessly in a check mark formation.;2017-05-15 00:00:00;30 seconds;4 orange Lights Smoothly Floating in the clear sky effortlessly in a check mark formation My Friends and I were laying down looking at the stars on a lake listening to music.  one friend stood up and the other sat up to talk to him and as i played there i noticed 4 lights moving under the big dipper they were flying in a v formation but more like a check mark cuz there was an extra one on the right side, the were orange tint but not like a normal light it was more of a glow, the manner of which they moved was amazing it was like a leaf on a body of water being pushed by the breeze, i thought i was imagining it so i said ever so elegantly ((What)) is that? and to my surprise both of my friends saw the same object we were baffled and we watched it for a few more seconds before it disappeared into the light pollution of houston, now this a key part of this sighting PLANES do not disappear in light pollution you can still see a plane in light pollution because it does not fly high enough so given this and the size of these lights they had to be! of enormous size they were bigger than a plane that passed by later that we watched even as it was flying into the light pollution, the light pollution covered theses orbs meaning it was flying above the 3000 miles that a plane flys this was a breath taking experience and changed my life. there was no sound!!! we heard the plane that came later!!!!  ((What)) did i SEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!  2 planes came after i don't know if they were military or not but they were noticeable as i described, the lights also appeared to never change distance and if there was a weird haze almost like you see on camouflaged ships in sic fi movies.  truly breath taking.;29.9285955128205;-95.6660801282055
While relaxing in our hot tub, 3 small dot lights flying in rapid movements in all directions in the sky!;2020-06-09 22:00:00;1 minute;While relaxing in our hot tub, 3 small dot lights flying in rapid movements in all directions in the sky! My husband and I were sitting in our hot tub, relaxing after work.  We saw one small dot of light move across the open dark sky in a straight line going North, then move in rapid movements in all directions, and disappeared.  Then almost immediately 3 appeared, following each other in rapid movements in all directions, but still grouped together going East.  All three disappeared at the same time.  All three UFO were small dots of light.  The first one we saw was bigger than the stars and the further they went, the dimmer and smaller they were.;29.9285955128205;-95.6660801282055
