Possible Abduction Attempt in Cypress, Texas;2010-12-04 02:10:00;3 minutes;Possible Abduction Attempt in Cypress, Texas   I was sleeping and I awoke by the covers on the bed being pulled tight arounds me at all corners of the bed.  I couldn't move...I heard a loud humming noise in the room, so loud that it hurt my ears, and then a bright light came pouring into the room and I lifted my head and screamed to for my husband who fell asleep on the couch...I screamed as loud as I could and it wouldn't come out loud, it came out so soft but I could hear what I was yelling....then a small blue circle of light came out of the ceiling and beamed down to my husbands side of the bed...I was still trying to yell for my husband but nothing was coming out and I was comletedly paralyzed...Then all of the sudden the blue light went back up through the ceiling and the covers were loose again, I pulled back the covers and when I came up out of the bed, a red beam of light shot out of the bedroom window....I told my husband, I'm not nuts but I know what I saw and felt....I never believed in this ! kind of stuff before, and so when I told my husband what had happened, he told me to go online and read the stories and this is so true as to what happend to me.

I looked out in the sky and saw spherical shape rocketing straight up leaving a thin white line of exhaust.  This object was was going faster than I have seen anything travel like faster than the speed of light.   Then, the object veered slowly to the right and continued on a slow course for about 15 minutes and disappeared out of range it appeared to be a small rocket-shaped vehicle with bright lights at tip.  It was mesmerizing to watch.;29.9285955128205;-95.6660801282055
