A single Triangle UFO flew quickly and silently over Cypress, Texas, at night.;2011-01-22 18:30:00;10 - 15 seconds;A single Triangle UFO flew quickly and silently over Cypress, Texas, at night. Type of UFO:  Triangle or V-shape like geese flying, with V having about 8 well defined, orange-ish lights evenly spaced along each leg of the V. Direction of Flight:  East to West. Approximate Height above Ground:  5,000 feet. Approximate Distance from Witnesses:  5,000 feet. Color of Body:	varied from 'shimmering black' to 'faint white cloud', though the lights on the leading edge V were pretty consistent in brightness and color.  I would have said that it was trying to be camouflaged, except for the lights on the V. Other Details:   1. My wife, my brother and I were in my spa.  We were looking at constellations, and I had just pointed out a satellite that was moving west to east almost directly overhead.  I often spend all of my spa time looking for satellites and meteors.  This evening, after about 20 minutes of spa time, my peripheral vision caught the lights of the UFO.  I immediately recognized it as one that I had seen on TV shows, like History and Discovery....the Triangle-shaped type. I yelled at my wife and brother, who immediately witnessed the UFO and saw it for about 10 seconds.  It was moving quickly, was flying straight and level, and made no sound. As it went over my garage roof, I ran from the spa to my driveway, but a street lamp blinded me.  The event was over.   I called 911 and Constable came out.  We talked for 10 minutes.  He had seen UFOs (2 bright, fast flying spheres) a long time ago.  He was nice enough, but said that they only write up reports if a crime was committed.... My wife, my brother and I all had different perceptions of UFO size, height above ground, and distance from us, but we all saw it. 2.  After the sighting, my wife talked about how the UFO looked faintly white, like a weak cloud.  I then realized that, while looking for meteors that night, I had noticed an odd, faint, stationary white spot low in the sky.  I first thought that it was a faint cluster of stars, but then I realized that I never saw a cluster of stars in that location.  Then I just figured that it was a small, irregularly shaped cloud, and ignored it.  Looking back, though, the odd looking cloud never moved, and it was the only cloud in the area...it was a clear night.  That could have been the UFO, stationary, before I saw it moving. Witness Background: 55 year old white male, Master's Degree, several professional credentials, 6 years in Navy as a Surface Warfare Officer.;29.9285955128205;-95.6660801282055

I saw a silver triangle and at first I thought it was the morning sun reflecting on an airplane.  I have seen that before, but then it just disappeared.  There was nothing there.;29.9285955128205;-95.6660801282055
