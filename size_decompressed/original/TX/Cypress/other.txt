Light with trail and a flash in the sky over Cypress, Texas.;2012-12-03 14:20:00;15 seconds;Light with trail and a flash in the sky over Cypress, Texas I was in the Lone Star College-CyFair parking lot facing west (on the south side of the tech building) in my pickup talking on my cell phone.  I looked out the window which I had rolled down and observed a light that was long in length side to side traveling in a North-north-west direction.   If you looked at the sun, the object was 45 degrees up to the right of the sun, in the clearing of the clouds.  It had like a trail, but it was not a contrail in anyway, then there was a flash and it was totally gone from the sky.   There were neither planes nor jets I could see in the sky at the time, there was moderate cloud cover, but my view was not obscured.   I thought jet, but it was way too long to be a jet or conventional aircraft and I could not guess at the altitude, but maybe 60 degrees up and seemed very distant.    I am a former truck driver, current small business owner and college student.;29.9285955128205;-95.6660801282055
Sighting in Cypress, Texas.;2014-10-22 20:00:00;15-20 seconds;Sighting in Cypress, Texas. It headed a north direction with circular/Short cylinder shape..  It had a Red/Orange color all around (almost like fire) it never blinked and it kept itself illuminated the entire duration. No audible sound was heard or created, it had a controlled speed (not super fast almost floating like gravitating towards the north).   Distance wise it appeared to be much closer than commercial air-crafts that also flew around the space.   After we lost sight of the unknown flying object we stayed out to see if there could possible be more but none others were seen.;29.9285955128205;-95.6660801282055
