Now the storm was moving NE. after it hovering  for about 15 to 20 seconds the object started moving NW very slow then in a blink it took off. No sound at all ((NUFORC Note:  Photo indicates a blurry, dark object against storm clouds.    Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));29.9285955128205;-95.6660801282055
a  perfect sphere travels across the face of the full moon under telescope magnification;2003-09-07 22:00:00;1.5 sec;a  perfect sphere travels across the face of the full moon under telescope magnification I was viewing moon with a large telescope a 13 inch f 4.5 dobsonium with a wide field 20mm ocular . the moon full at 88 power and my field of view had the moon centered perfectly. Very clear perfectly focused. From right to left a sphere dark not black traveled across the face of the moon. No lights no other movment . This was like nothing I have ever seen before. It was so regular and normal looking. The size for scale ,moon size of a basketball very bright, object dark the size of a small pea. I have been building telescopes for 22 years reference california sidwalk astronomy. I have never seen in all my years any ufos or the like. I just do not believe the hype, but this has me very upset, scared, confused. I looked at the moon without scope nothing nada it just vanished after its shawdow passed in front of the moon.

My neighbor knocked on my door and asked me to come outside because he was seeing something he had not ever seen before in the sky.;2013-06-05 21:00:00;5 minutes;My neighbor knocked on my door and asked me to come outside because he was seeing something he had not ever seen before in the sky. When we walked to the end of the driveway he indicated there were 2 large round glowing objects that crossed the sky from the South headed North and that it had stopped and hovered for a minute and then zagged across the sky together at a high rate of speed.  When I got there those 2 were gone, but as we were talking another object appeared from the Southern sky and proceeded to move across the sky headed North with no sound.  It appeared to be pretty large round glowing orange object.  It never stopped and disppeared over the horizon in the North. We stood around for awhile hoping to see another one, but did not.  We did however see 2 helicopters flying from the South head North within a few minutes of seeing the object.  We could not tell if they were military or not as it was dark and they were pretty high in the sky. A little later as we were still standing outside looking a neighbor from down the street came by in her truck and asked us if we also had seen the lights.  She also had seen the lights and was wondering what they were. I have no idea what I saw, but I can say I have never seen anything like it before in the sky.  I believe my neighbor had some type of picture on his iPhone.;29.9285955128205;-95.6660801282055
