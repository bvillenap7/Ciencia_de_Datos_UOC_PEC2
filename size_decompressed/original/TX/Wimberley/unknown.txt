We were looking at all the tires of our vehicles, the freezer, and we both started walking toward our propane tank, trying to find what was leaking and leaking very loud, The sound was every where then suddenly stopped and a gust of wind whipped through the top of trees and blew suddenly across my face, the sky was overcast and we live in a cedar (juniper) thicket so I have to say we saw nothing.  I have never experienced a sound like that. Thanks for being.;30.0225;-98.1137999999995

I noticed a moving object and believed it was a satelite orbiting---it was approxiamately the same size and color---white reflection.  I pointed it out to friend, but then the object made a direct right turn, so we believed it could be a plane.  The object then began to go in reverse, impossible for a plane.  The light became brighter and an orange light shoine from the object then.  The object continued to move forward and back, then in tiny little loops.  We then questioned if it could be a falling airplane, but it's height did not change much.  This continued for sometime, and then an actual airplane flew by, far below the object.  The object then became still and did not move for ten minutes.  WE then left the area---confused but assured it was not a plane, and far too high for a helicopter.;30.0225;-98.1137999999995
