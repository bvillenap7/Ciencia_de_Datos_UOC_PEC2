A very bright light was moving very quickly and erradically in the southern sky. It was just after dusk and the moon was waxing and up. The light would stop and go straight up, from side to side, shoot down and then back up. It was quite a show. And then it got better. Two air force fighter jets suddenly appeared in the sky and started chasing it. At first, the jets matched it, almost move for move. This went on for a few minutes. Then the light disappeared. The jets circled the area for while looking for it and eventually flew off. The town I live in is surrounded by air force bases, especially at that time, and I can only assume that this light must have shown up on radar. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They were small balls of white light, not moving in a straight line. They would change direction or move in a circle. After about an hour my husband saw what looked like a square light open in the sky and one of those white lights came out and flew off across the sky.;30.0225;-98.1137999999995
