I was driving home and it was 8:10pm, clear skies, and this star caught my eye and I guess it was turning and the sun hit it just right and it looked like a star,  as I was looking at it, I lost it  and I said wait a minute that's not a star.  As I was turning onto my street I saw it and it was a metallic color and it was just hovering there, in the southern sky, which San Antonio, Tx, is south of where I was at, so I stopped my car and when I got out with my phone to get a video it started moving east and then started moving south and then as it took off to the South a plane flew over and that was at 8:40pm Central  Time.. and I have video;30.0225;-98.1137999999995
