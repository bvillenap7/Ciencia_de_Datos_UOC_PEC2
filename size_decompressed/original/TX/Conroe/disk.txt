3 lights - red, yellow, and blue ufo seen in Conroe, TX;1986-06-07 22:00:00;5 minutes;3 lights - red, yellow, and blue ufo seen in Conroe, TX It was during the summer of 1986.  My mom just yelled at me and grounded me.  My dad, feeling sorry for me, said let's go pull the new truck into our car port.  When we got inside the truck my dad couldn't turn the truck on and this was a brand new truck.  It seemed like all power of the truck was gone.  My dad was about to out and check until we saw a saucer like spaceship hovering very close on top of our house.  It had bright likes in the color of red, blue, and yellow.  Very slowly it started moving along the trees behind our house and as soon as it was away and couldn't be seen anymore the power of the truck came back on.  We never really spoke about again until last year when I asked if he remembered it and he said, yes, as if it were yesterday.;30.2515651465799;-95.4580058631923
