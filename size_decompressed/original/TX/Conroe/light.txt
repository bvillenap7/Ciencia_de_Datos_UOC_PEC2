A speeding craft and several lost hours;1980-07-15 21:00:00;3 to 4 Hours;A speeding craft and several lost hours During this time I worked as an Insurance/Anuity Sales Person. I lived in Dallas but was working on assignment in the Houston area. It was Thursday night around 8:00 to 9:00 pm and I was driving back to Dallas (home) on Interstate 45. I had just passed through Conroe going north when my Ford Pick-Up just quit running, at 70 mph all the idiot lights came on and that was it. I coasted as far as I could then finally stopped knowing that 2 associates of mine would be coming by momentarily on their way back to Dallas and I'd be rescued. I turned the emergency flashers on and went back and lowered the tailgate of the truck to sit on while I watched for my associates. After 10 minutes or so I looked up and noticed for the first time how beautiful the stars were out in the country without all the city lights to block them from view. I kept looking up until my neck started to hurt and then I remembered a 4 ft section of plywood that I had laying down in the bed of the truck. I also had several cement blocks among the other junk that seemed to always occupy the truck bed. I quickly got up and arranged the blocks so that they were under the plywood, holding it up at about a 30 degree elevation so I could lay down to look at the stars and still see the oncoming traffic. I laid down and began looking up at the stars. I had been watching the sky for about 30-45 minutes when I first saw it. It (the object) was really nothing more than a very bright light that appeared to be 10 to 20,000 ft. up. Nothing unusual, right? Nothing could be further from the truth. I watched this.... thing....for what seemed to be about 30 minutes or so and during that time it went across the sky in mere seconds.....it made right angle turns......it got bigger and brighter and then dim again, it crossed the sky once more from east to west then in mid-flight just seemed to disappear. I mean one second it was there, then the next second it was GONE! Now up until this point in my life I had not ever thought much about UFO's however I was beginning to re-evaluate my way of thinking. Anyway, with that over my attention now was re-directed to watching for my associates and getting rescued from my predicament. As I sat quietly and watched for my friends it became increasingly clear that there was far less traffic on this road than there should be at 10:00 pm at night on an Interstate Highway, 60 miles out of Houston. Up until this point it had not dawned on me to look at my watch since I knew roughly what time it was, but when I did look at my watch I got the shock of my life....IT WAS 1:45 AM. IT WAS ALMOST 4 HOURS LATER! Reality started to set in at this point.....I must have fallen asleep and missed my associates.....but I DID NOT FALL ASLEEP! I REMEMBER EVERY LAST DETAIL OF EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED. This missing time thing was real creepy but I had more important issues to deal with at the moment. I got on my CB radio and called out for anyone that could help. After 30 or 40 minutes of doing that, I got a response. It was a partially loaded Car Hauler and the driver said for 50 bucks he'd take me and my truck all the way to Dallas. What GREAT luck! In an hour or so we were loaded and on our way to Dallas. When we got back to Dallas we unloaded the truck and I thanked the driver and went into my house. Several hours later I went out to check the truck for problems. I got in and turned the ignition and it started right up. I never found any problems with the truck and it never repeated. It was a few years later that I heard about abductees and all that. I mentioned this to an acquaintance at work and this guy looked at me like I was a fool. He told everyone at work about it and then I was BRANDED The resident UFO Nut! It wasn't long before I was forced to quit this job and go elsewhere for work. I never mentioned this again before now. After this incident, my life took a nosedive into the toilet. It was weird. It was like I had a big sign on me that said UFO Freak. I went from a 6 figure a year sales career in insurance to selling cars for a living. As incredible as this may sound, I lost my ability to sell that night. From 80 to zero literally Overnight. I firmly believe that I was abducted that night. I don't remember any of it, but I know it happened....what else could explain the loss of time! If I ever find one of those people that can do hypnotic regression, I find out for sure. I hope that this is not too long but I know of no other way of explaining this to your readers. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have received many similar reports from across the U. S..

Fast point of light (no tail) decending rapidly towards the earth at a down angle of ~45 degrees of 45 degrees;1998-12-16 20:53:00;7 seconds;Fast point of light (no tail) decending rapidly towards the earth at a down angle of ~45 degrees of 45 degrees It's 8:53 pm CST, traveling north on Interstate 45 just before the exit for FM 1488 (road), My spouse and I observed a point of light @ NNW enter our field of vision available from within the car (top of the windshield). The object rapidly decended from a approx 8000 ft to below the treetops in a perfect (not parabalic) line 45 degrees downward, appearing to head NE.  The object maintained its albeit small (point of light) shape for the duration of observation.  The light was white, it had no visible tail, no sparks, suggesting it wasn't a meteor.  Distance to object is uncertain due to small size of light.;30.2515651465799;-95.4580058631923
three lights in triangl form moved in  L  shape patern.....seemed to be one object....;2000-01-10 21:00:00;more than  30 min;three lights in triangl form moved in  L  shape patern.....seemed to be one object.... this was very high up .  it looked like 3 colored circles....if you look at a triangle , these lights would be at each point of the triangle...one red light , one blue light & one green light....i thought we were seeing the space station mir before it had come down....but when we saw it move in an  L  shaped pattern(meaning that it started at the top of the  L  moved to the bottom & back to the top) this took approx 5 seconds. it also looked like it would rotate & would send a flash of light....after it moved in an  L  shape , we were spooked & left.....i havent seen it anymore...is there an explanation for this or have you heard of anything similar ????  we had a very clear unobstructed view on a clear night....date may not be exactly right.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  He corrected date to 2000.  Depending on the apparent size of the object, as viewed from the vantage point of the witness, the object may have been a twinkling star, but that is only a possible explanation, based on our experience.

High altitude steady lights passing from horizon to horizon not on sat paths;2004-07-15 10:15:00;45 min;High altitude steady lights passing from horizon to horizon not on sat paths We saw an extremely high altitude, unwavering, unblinking light pass over from West to East horizon at a high velocity.  About 45 seconds from horizon to horizon, steady speed.  3 minutes later we observed a seemingly higher altitude light pass from North to South at the same perceived velocity.  About 45 seconds again from horizon to horizon.  This object was significantly more difficult to track as the perceived altitude was much farther (higher).  We used the peripheral vision techniqe used to observe very dim stars in order to track the path of this one.  It cruised steady on course and then veered slightly to the southeast before we lost visual contact.  Appx. 50 minutes later we saw a third light at an even HIGHER perceived altitude cruise from North to South again, same speed and timing.  This object was EXTREMELY difficult to see or track and we lost its track much quicker than the previous two objects.  It was my impression that the viewings encountered were at increasingly higher altitudes, however, they appeared to travel at the same velocity as each subsequent object.;30.2515651465799;-95.4580058631923
6 small circular subdued lights in triangular formation slowly traveling across night sky;2006-09-19 20:30:00;about 5 sec.;6 small circular subdued lights in triangular formation slowly traveling across night sky I was out walking my dog when I glanced up in the sky towards the north and noticed 6 subdued circular lights traveling in a triangle formation, equally spaced apart but close together.  At first I thought it might be a plane but there were no blinking lights and no noise.  I continued to watch them go overhead and off towards the south and eventually disappear into the distance.;30.2515651465799;-95.4580058631923
Bright orb light racing across skyline.;2015-11-08 19:57:00;2 seconds;Bright orb light racing across skyline At approximately 7.58 pm on November 8 I witnessed an orb like light above the tree line in my backyard. It traveled at a very high rate of speed.  I also witnessed an orb type light going in the opposite direction a couple of nights ago but it was much brighter and was traveling in the opposite direction also at a high rate of speed.  There was no noise associated with either.;30.2515651465799;-95.4580058631923

It traveled quickly and silently in a straight line and disappeared near a neighborâ€™s house. The home owner observed this in real time from the back porch.;30.2515651465799;-95.4580058631923
