I was cruisin on I45 between conroe and houston around 8:30 when i noticed two lights hovering about 250 yards up over the freeway.At first i thought they were small aircrafts flying kinda low .then i started thinkin that after 911  there would be tighter restrictions with airplanes flying low in populated areas. The lights were moving  northeast  at a slow pace . first there were two lights  hovering around each other about 500 ft apart.They would move in close to each other and rotate in circles slowly.They did not make noise .The lights flashed and pulsed . It also had flashing colors on the sides.I could see the silohouete of the crafts. they were square in shape.As I rode down the interstate I was trying to register what  was seeing. As i came to Cypress Springs exit, the radio station i was listening to reported strange lights in Pasadena  and Galveston on 288 . They seemed pretty excited about it. I pulled over at a gas station off the exit and noticed other people looking up at the lights. I got off and was talking to some observers when three more lights started coming across the sky heading the same direction as the others . They were about 3 to 4 hundred yards from each other moving at the exact same speed. They wouuld seem to form  a sporadic formation. As I drove to my destination i noticed two more lights heading the same directions. They did the same thing just hovered near each other and moved slowly towards the others. They were the last lights that i saw that night.  all i can say is that i'm not the only on that saw these lights, and i would like for next time to be able to share this experience with my family and friends.
