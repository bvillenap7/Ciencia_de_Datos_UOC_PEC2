Alert intercept/fighter in full afterburner, manoevering through Houston IAH airspace.;2015-03-06 14:35:00;3 minutes;Alert intercept/fighter in full afterburner, manoevering through Houston IAH airspace. Report:  Intercept/fighter launched around Houston.  I am a former navy cryptologist familiar with launching alert aircraft.   On the reported date, I witnessed a single jet interceptor/fighter.  I sighted him then pulled over, exited my vehicle and took apx a dozen very clear photos of his manoever from east to north-northeast.   Very clear contrail on essentially a cloudless day.  He was in afterburner and gaining altitude to go faster.   An alert is not going to happen as an exercise especially right through the holding patter of Houston IAH.;30.2515651465799;-95.4580058631923
