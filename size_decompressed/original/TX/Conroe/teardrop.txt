They appeared to be bright lights low in the sky and began to form different formations! They seemed teardrop shaped and then would look light a trail of bright light coming from one end that turned the objects directing them into another formation. This appeared to us  how  they could move and change from a ring of 6 bright objects into a formation of 3 on top of 3, and then 2 on top of 4!  It caught our eye and we thought it might be several planes coming very close on same path until they continued to change positions. We were traveling north on Hwy 45 just outside of Conroe, TX, on our way to Huntsville, TX.;30.2515651465799;-95.4580058631923
