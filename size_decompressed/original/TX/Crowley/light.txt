Bright green light at 2am.;2008-01-22 02:30:00;1 minute;Bright green light at 2am I worked as a manager at a popular fast food chain and after closing, I was getting a ride home with another employee. As we drove down the street late at night, we suddenly saw what appeared to be a bright green star. It grew in intensity, made the whole sky seem to glow slightly green, then split in two and shot off in different directions.  We were both completely silent for about 15 seconds before he asked if I saw that. I confirmed that I did.  It was very cold that night but at that point, it felt much colder. ((NUFORC Note:  If object was visible for one minute, it probably was not a meteor.  PD));32.5845;-97.3741
