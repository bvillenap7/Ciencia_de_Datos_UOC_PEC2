Triangular UFO picture with plane and sandhill cranes;2018-10-27 16:15:00;Pictures taken within 5 s;Triangular UFO picture with plane and sandhill cranes I went outside during the afternoon of October 27, 2018 to throw out the garbage and heard some birds overhead.  As an avid birdwatcher, I take my binoculars with me when I go outside from time to time.  Unfortunately, this time I did not.  However the birds I was hearing I was familiar with what they were (sandhill cranes).  I decided to whip out my smart phone and take a picture of the area where I could hear them.  I took the picture to see approximately how many where flying around.  I ended up taking two pictures. When I got back in the house to look at my pictures to find the birds, I noticed a triangular object in one of the two pictures I took.  I found the object before finding the birds in the picture.  The birds are a large bird with a wingspan of 6'8.  In the opposite direction of the birds is the triangular object.  The object seems to be in only one of the two pictures.  The pictures are taken five seconds apart according to the time stamp.  One other item in the picture is an airplane with it's contrails. I never noticed the triangular object with my naked eyes or heard anything other than the birds.  It also happened to be a clear day. This happened in close proximity, sky-wise, to another observance I had one evening maybe in the last two months.  I don't have the exact evening and it was somewhere around 21:30 to 22:30.  I was looking the same direction just as this observerance and noticed a light in the sky.  It was like a bright star which didn't move, however it was there and then it vanished, as if it burned out.  This observerance I happened to be inside and looking out my kitchen window.  It happened as long as maybe a minute or two.;32.5845;-97.3741
