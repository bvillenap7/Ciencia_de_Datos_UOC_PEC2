Blinking object red, green, white.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star, maybe Sirius.  PD));2012-03-28 20:00:00;2 +;blinking object red, green, white. At about 21:30 PM I noticed a flickering star, then went in to watch the rest of a movie. At about 22:00 I stepped outside and noticed it was still there yet more clearer and blinking red, green and white. I fished for my binoculars and couldn’t make out what it was.  I got my wife out to look, she noticed a second one. I then went in for my 4 in telescope.  Still couldn’t make it out so I set up my 12in telescope.  The object did not move while I set either of them up. At about 0:00 midnight it began to drop into the horizon. By 0:30 it was gone. No matter what magnification I put on my telescopes the objects remained the same blinking red, white, green. prior to midnight the objects stayed in the same spot for about 2 hours. The second object is still there however, I am retiring for the night. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star, maybe Sirius.  PD));32.5845;-97.3741
