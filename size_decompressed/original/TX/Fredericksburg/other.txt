At 12:20:56 p.m. I took a photo of a silver object in the sky above the 9th fairway. The object appeared to be about 40-50 feet in the air and moved up and down a couple of times. As I neared the object, my cell phone spontaneously emitted a loud warning and transmitted an Emergency Call to 911, Sprint, my wife and the club pro. My golf partner also took a photo. His was from a different position, more nearly under the object. We looked for, but didnâ€™t find, a connection of the object to nearby structures, including trees. When we looked again, shortly after completing our round, the object had disappeared.;30.2846000000002;-98.8781000000009
