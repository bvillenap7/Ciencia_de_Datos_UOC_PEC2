((HOAX??))  Aliens at Fredricksburg.;2011-04-20 00:00:00;about 5 minutes;Aliens at Fredricksburg  Me and my friend were on a roadtrip.  We didn't have any destination, so we ended up driving to the middle of nowhere (Fredricksburg).   It was late at night when we arrived and we were searching for a hotel, but failed to find one.  Finally, we pulled over to ask a stranger for directions.  We saw a man standing on a street corner, which was strange since it was almost midnight.  When we got out of the car, we thought we saw someone standing behind the stranger.   Suddenly, before we had a chance to say anything, there was a flash of blue light in the distance.  At first, we assumed it might have been lightning, but there were no clouds in the sky.  Instead, when we looked up, we saw several disks hovering in the sky, and the man was gone.   My friend and I were frightened and stunned, we returned to the car immdeiately, and drove back home the next day.
