I was in my backyard when my dog suddenly became frightened, and ran into his pen. I looked up, and saw a teardrop shape flying above. It was black in color and shiny. I watched it fly in a straight line for less than a minute or so. A tree got in the way of my sight, and when I was able to get around it, the object was nowhere to be found.;30.2846000000002;-98.8781000000009
