I went outside at ten till 9 pm last night going from the main house to the trailer and noticed this light in the sky that was very bright and shaped like an eye, or oval shaped.  It stayed there for 20 minites and was changing colors every few seconds.  I went and got my wife and had her look at it and we were both estonished by it.  I went and got my hunting rifle and looked at it through the scope and saw it a little better.  It was very bright in the scope and I could see it change colors better, but I couldn't really make out the shape that well. It moved slowly toward the south west and then eventually disappeared.  It was obviously something out of the ordinary, because as soon as I saw it, I was stunned. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD));29.6626;-94.5945
