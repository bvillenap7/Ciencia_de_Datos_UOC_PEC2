According to the pictures the object seemed to have moves a little within the forty five minutes between the times the photos were taken.  We live on a 430 acres ranch, and is located prairie, and farm land for miles. The camera was placed on a fence post facing Southeast . We do not have any tall trees in this area. The rod shaped object seem to have an aura around it. It is like lines that run the length of the object, and different colors. There is two pictures with the object in them in the upper right side of the pictures. There is one picture that was taken in the same location, but was taken in daytime. You can see the background, and area better. There is a canal that runs behind the brush where we get water for our fields.  A set of pictures will be sent by E-Mail for you viewing. Each picture has a date, and time on them.  Some day, and some night shots. Pictures #32, and #33 show the rod shaped object. There will be before, and after pictures also.;29.6626;-94.5945
