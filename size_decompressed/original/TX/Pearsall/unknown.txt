Appeared to be impossibly large for their speed Saw 2 unknown flying objects. Two sets of alternating blinking lights, far away and traveling at extremely high speeds.  I was able to observe the light for a long period of time, even at extreme distances. No sound at all.  The lights seemed very far apart, especially for objects moving so fast.  Could have possibly been 4 separate objects.  But they stayed at a consistent distance;28.8955;-99.0954000000001
