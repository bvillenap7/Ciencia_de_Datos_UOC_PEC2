My sighting was along time ago and some details are hard to remember.One summer nite i was takeing my sister to pick up some clothes fr;1972-06-01 22:00:00;3 /4 min.;My sighting was a long time ago and some details are hard to remember.One summer nite i was taking my sister to pick up some clothes from the garage of my parents house that had burned down .She was in the garage for some time and i had became restless and had laided my head on the car door from the inside of the car on the drivers side. Iwas looking up gazing at the stars it was a clear nite . Then out of no where a triangle formation of lighted dots drifted across the sky.There was no sound . If i had not been looking up i would have never seen this event.I was startled and amazed at what i was wittnessing .I had to move to the other side of the car very quickly because the dots of lights were moveing at a pretty good drift. The amount of dots or disk that i saw were between 12 or14  moving in a northeasterly direction.The lights did not stop or move in any wierd manner, they stayed on a straight path . Their color was like a white silver more whiteish sort of like a full bright clear moon. Idid tell my father and sister and mother about this sighting and fact on that nite i had also yelled at my sister to come and see but she was trying to get her clothes and didn't make it out in time to see . I have waited a long time to tell anybody else because most people think your crazy . I also didn't know where to report such a matter until i recently got on the net and found this site.;29.3980948275862;-94.9513189655171
