I was driving and I know that it wasn't going to hang around long, so I fumbled for my phone and put it on video and moved my hand back and forth hoping to capture it.   I also noticed that another truck had pulled off to the side of the road.  I passed the truck and stopped also and tried to look for the lights but I didn't see them anymore.   The black truck had left and I also left.  I don't know if they seen the lights, too, but we both stopped in the same area.   I went home got ready for work and recently looked at the 11 second film and was happy to see I did capture it.  It looks flat like when I first seen them, but in the picture (still frame) I can see the contrails of each light.  I don't want to here Chinese lanterns either.  They use that excuse for everything now.   I would like a real educated guess.  I think ufo cause it just vanished after like 30 to 40 seconds.  Do ur own still frame and tell me what it is please.  Seen in Texas City, TX.;29.3980948275862;-94.9513189655171
