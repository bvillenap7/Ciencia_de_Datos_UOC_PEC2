Bright white ball-shaped light with green trailing light, traveling from low  to high speed.;2008-03-07 22:40:00;4 SECONDS;Bright white ball-shaped light with green trailing light, traveling from low  to high speed. I was driving home Southbound on Hwy #146 toward Texas City, TX, when suddenly a bright white light(ball shaped, much larger that an average aircraft) appeared from the northwest moving southeast. The light was followed by a bright green tail, very much like a shooting star would have. At first sight the ball of light was traveling at a low speed, then suddenly picked up to an extremely high speed and then dimmed quickly out of sight. The ball appeared strangely low to the ground, approximately 300 - 500 yards high. I am documenting this sighting moments after I witnessed it so as not to forget anything, also the night is very cold and very clear, the stars are unusually visible tonight.
