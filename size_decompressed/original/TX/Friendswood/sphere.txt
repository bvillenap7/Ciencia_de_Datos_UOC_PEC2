Large orb yellowish orange object traveling in a north to south direction. Object was the size of a dime held at arms length. No sound was detected. No flashing lights were observed.  My wife and I were sitting on our front porch when my wife sighted this large bright yellowish orang light coming into view from behind our oak tree. I tried to video without success but my wife and I watched the object until it traveled out of our line of sight. The object appeared to be about 45deg of horizon and the speed appeared to be about the same as a passenger plane would be on airport approach. Object appeared to be at an altitude of maybe 1500 ft. . Speed of the object was constant from our vantage point.;29.5209608108108;-95.1926013513515

I looked in the sky and noticed a light, it was solid red for 3 seconds and then flashed green. It was very high up and not moving at all. It was staying in one spot for 4 minutes and then it suddenly started moving very fast.  It didn't dart off it was just going very fast then started to sway left to right and finally started moving so fast we couldn't see it anymore.;29.5209608108108;-95.1926013513515
