Large red/yellow fireball seen low in the horizon over Houston, TX  area;2011-09-07 20:10:00;5 seconds;Large red/yellow fireball seen low in the horizon over Houston, TX  area 20:10 PM   7 Sept 11   Friendswood, TX  77546  I was walking down the street and happened to look at the clear, dark sky.   Stars were just starting to be visible. I was surprised to see a large ball of light moving from South to North at an approximately 30 degree angle in front of me.  It was moving slowly from right to left as I was facing it.  It seemed to be a large round fireball of a red and yellow color with a large red and yellow tail creating no sound.  I was able to see it for about 5 seconds before it disappeared behind some trees and a house.  I had never seen anything like it except in pictures.  All the falling/shooting stars I have seen have always been high in the sky, much smaller, and of a white or blue color.;29.5209608108108;-95.1926013513515
Orange lights in the sky.;2015-10-03 22:06:00;4 minutes;Orange lights in the sky This was seen last Saturday at 10:06 pm.  At first I thought these were missiles or some type of military aircraft.  Many people all over the world  have witnessed these strange lights.  I've never seen this in my life.   These lights looked like circular fire balls and  don't resemble anything military grade as they made no noise and seemed to fly fairly low but not close enough to visibly see what the object was.  Nor do I believe they are Chinese lanterns or any type of home crafted object.  I know the video is a little hard to see but you can definitely see the strange pattern of these orange lights, it's almost as if they were following each other.  There were about 10-12 of these objects.  I would really like to find out what so many people all over the world have witnessed daily in so many different states and countries.   Below is two videos one of which I'm trying to zoom in on the object.  The other is 47 seconds long and shows multiple of these glowing objects in the sky.   Please pardon some of the language myself and my friends and some other people at the restaurant were spooked.;29.5209608108108;-95.1926013513515
