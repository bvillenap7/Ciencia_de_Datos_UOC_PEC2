Object sitting stationary in the sky.;2020-05-19 11:30:00;2 minutes;Most days I like to sit on my front porch and just take pictures of the sky and clouds and sometimes I get an image of something I don't recognize..Living close to Johnson Space Center & Joint Base Ellington we see quite a few objects in the sky day and night. Today was no exception, I captured an object sitting stationary in the sky to the S.E and below the clouds . I have pictures and will send with this report.;29.5209608108108;-95.1926013513515
