SLOW MOVING AIRCRAFT /  LARGE ROUND WHITE LIGHTS  PULSING IN UNISON ACROSS BACK OF CRAFT;2001-03-12 20:00:00;5 MINUTES;SLOW MOVING AIRCRAFT /  LARGE ROUND WHITE LIGHTS  PULSING IN UNISON ACROSS BACK OF CRAFT AT APPROX. 20:00 HRS WHILE LOOKING TO THE NORTH EAST, AN AIRBORNE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY MY WIFE AND I. NO VISABLE CRAFT STRUCTURE COULD BE SEEN, OTHER THAN THREE VERY LARGE WHITE LIGHTS RUNNING HORIZONTAL ACROSS THE BACK OF THE CRAFT. THE LARGE WHITE LIGHTS WERE PULSING FROM DIM TO BRIGHT SIMULTANIOUSLY EVERY 2 SECONDS.  A RED & WHITE STROB WAS OBSERVED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TRAILING EDGE OF THE CRAFT CLOSEST TO US. THE CRAFT AS IT TRACKED FROM THE NORTH EAST TO THE SOUTH WEST APPEARED TO BE APPROX. 2 MILES DISTANCE AT AN ALTITUDE OF APPROX. 2500 FEET AND AT AN ANGLE OF VIEW OF APPROX 45 DEGREES. WHAT IS INTERESTING IS, THAT THERE WAS NO NOISE DETECTED FROM THE CRAFT AND IT WAS TRAVELING AT A MUCH SLOWER RATE, THAN OTHER AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED FLYING IN THE AREA.  WE ARE IN THE FLIGHT PATH FOR HOUSTON HOBBY AIRPORT AND OBSERVE AIRCRAFT ALL THE TIME DAY AND NIGHT ARRIVING AND DEPARTING THE AIRPORT. WE ARE ALSO CLOSE TO ELLINGTON FIELD AND NASA.;29.5209608108108;-95.1926013513515
2 Objects sighted 3 minutes apart traveling from the south to the north...;2017-05-25 19:15:00;2 minutes;2 Objects sighted 3 minutes apart traveling from the south to the north... At approximately 1915 hrs., my wife came in the house to tell me to come outside.  My wife pointed toward the Southeast, and we saw a very bright very dark amber light, almost red in color, coming toward us and overhead.  The craft had no discernible shape but the lighting on the bottom had the appearance of a sliced in half pomegranate...  At the time I didn't have any way to video it…  I went back inside the house to lookup the telephone number to report the incident, and just about the time I was dialing the number, my wife came running back in the house very excited telling me there was another craft just like the first one.  I grabbed my phone which has 4K video capability and ran outside to video this thing!  I kept the image direct center of my screen and zoomed in and out for 20 seconds never loosing sight and maintaining a clear picture.   After the craft had disappeared to the north, I played back the video and to my surprise, the video was scrambled!  I took another video afterwards to check and see if my camera was working properly by pointing to the sky and the video was excellent!  Evidently some type electromagnet radiation had disrupted my camera from taking a clear video image… I saved the video, so if you are interested in viewing I can send to you...;29.5209608108108;-95.1926013513515
