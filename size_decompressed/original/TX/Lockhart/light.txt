Strange moving light in the sky.;2019-08-25 22:50:00;:30;Strange moving light in the sky Stepped outside of apartments at 142 and toll road 130.  Was looking up at the clouds to see if chance of rain.  While looking north east I had noticed a dull light in the sky.  I thought at first maybe a drone but realized it had no actual shape or flashing colored lights.  It didn't have any sound and moved extremely fast and changed directions in an instant.  It appeared to be extremely high in the sky because it would disappear in and out of the very high clouds.   I watched it dart around the sky for about 30 seconds before it made its final disappearance in the clouds not to be seen again.   It didn't have an actual shape from what I could tell just a dull white light.;29.8860999999999;-97.6777000000002
