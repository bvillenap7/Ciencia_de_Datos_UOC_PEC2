To high for an aircraft, but too close for a satalite.  My son and his friend came out to see the lights and noticed a group of about 7 lights in a triangular shape towards the west.  Two of the lights shot off from the others going in opposite directions (west and east).  Then they just disappeared.  After that time fog began to roll in and we were unable to see any other lights.  The light were a blueish white in color and at times seemed to get very bright white.  The lights were too large for stars, but too high for jets.  We live near Houston Intercontinental Airport and I am fabiliar with planes, etc. that fly around the area.  These lights did not fit a normal configuration of any aircraft I have observed in the area. see above`;29.9897849785407;-95.2186158798282
