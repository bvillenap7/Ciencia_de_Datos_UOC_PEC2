Very bright light slowly moving north and then turned upward and faded.;2005-11-05 19:00:00;2 minutes;Very bright light slowly moving north and then turned upward and faded. My friend and I were about to leave my house when I looked up and saw a very bright star. At 1st I thought it was Venus but then realized that Venus was to the West. I then noticed that the light was slowly moving north. After nearly a minute, the light looked as if it quickly curved upward and slowly faded out of site over the next several seconds.;29.9897849785407;-95.2186158798282
Reddish orange light N of the Houston area, travelling S, stops for about 20,seconds, dims, brightens then vanishes.;2018-09-08 20:05:00;~2 minutes;Reddish orange light North of the Houston area, travelling South, stops for about 20 seconds, dims, brightens then vanishes. Reddish orange light slowly travelling North to South at about a 65 to 70 degree inclination above the horizon where it stopped and stood still for about 20 seconds, dimmed, brightened, then disappeared.  The object was below the anvil of a large thunderstorm complex that was off to my North.  I'm an avid aircraft observer and live in the approach path's of Houston's two largest airports so I'm accustomed to watching planes fly over.  This object looked, and behaved like no aircraft I have ever observed.   I checked Flightradar 24 and ADSB flight tracker and noted no aircraft in the area of the object.;29.9897849785407;-95.2186158798282
