Triangular object hovering above tree tops.;2008-03-20 19:50:00;5 minutes;Triangular object hovering above tree tops. I witnessed an unusual object in the sky while driving home from work on March 20, 2008 at about 7:50 p.m.  The object was hovering above the tree tops of a wooded area near FM1960 and Moon Trail Dr.  When I first noticed the very large bright white light in the sky,  I was driving east on FM 1960 and was about 2 miles away from it.  I didn't think much of it as I thought it was an airliner on approach to IAH airport with it's bright landing lights on. However, as I continued to approach it, I realized that is wasn't moving, but hovering over the tree tops about two tenths of a mile off of the main road.  Also strange was the fact that despite a fairly clear evening, the object seemed to be shrouded in fog (too low for a cloud) and the large bright light began moving back and forth onto itself--more like a very large spot light.  Couldn't clearly see the object itself, but could see the light moving back and forth through the fog/vapor.  It was very large, 3-5 times the size of the largest airliner. It continued to hover as I passed it, and I turned off of the main road at first chance to get a better look.  The under side was also shrouded in fog that was illuminated by various small white lights with an overall triangular shape. There seemed to be a smaller platform underneath. As I turned my vehicle to try to follow it, it very slowly and silently moved off towards the north, just above the tree tops out of view.  From the back it looked like a dark rectangular object with 3 large white lights across the back. It was too big for a helicopter or an airliner. There were no other aircraft in the sky at that time. FM 1960 is a busy road and I'm sure someone else had to see it, however there are often planes passing through there on approach to IAH.  If you weren't really paying attention you might just assume it was an airliner--except it was hovering.;29.9897849785407;-95.2186158798282
