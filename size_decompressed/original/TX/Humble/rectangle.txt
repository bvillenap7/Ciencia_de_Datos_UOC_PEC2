Very fast-moving object, bright with an apparent trail, headed Northeast and losing altitude near Humble, Tx.;2007-09-28 23:10:00;10 seconds;Very fast-moving object, bright with an apparent trail, headed Northeast and losing altitude near Humble, Tx. Description of interesting  flying object observed near Humble, TX.  My son and I were returning from a Houston Astros baseball game the evening of Sept. 28, 2007.  We were traveling north on U.S. 59, and at approximately 11:00 - 11:15 p.m. as we neared Humble, both of us observed a flying object that surprised us regarding how the object looked and the apparent speed of travel.  We observed it somewhere between Jetero Blvd. And FM 1960.  The object was traveling on a heading of about 45 degrees, and appeared to be at a fairly low altitude, and also appeared to be losing altitude.  The object was bright and appeared to be streaming material behind (my son thought it might have been on fire).  We drive this freeway often and see planes crossing overhead the freeway (east-west) all the time on final approach to Bush Intl airport.  What primarily caught our attention was the speed, direction and altitude of the object.  We watched it continue in a northeast direction, until it either got too low to see or disappeared over the horizon.  Afterward, we were very confused about where the object went and thought perhaps it just appeared close but was actually a meteorite burning up in the atmosphere much further away.  Since this occurred so close to the airport, there may be many explanations but it sure looked remarkable.;29.9897849785407;-95.2186158798282
AMBER SQUARE OBJECT, HIGH  IN  ATMOSPHERE, MOVING NW TO SE (1-MIN);2014-11-04 00:00:00;1 minutes;AMBER SQUARE OBJECT, HIGH  IN  ATMOSPHERE, MOVING NW TO SE (1-MIN) IT WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE THE GENERAL ELECTION THE TIME IS IFFY...IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETWEEN 11:00PM ON THE 3RD TO 3:00AM ON THE 4TH    I WAS TAKING SOME TRASH OUT TO THE TRASH CAN, WE LIVE NEAR AIRPORT, HEARD A JET FLY OVER, I LOOKED UP SAW THIS YELLOWISH SQUARE OBJECT FLYING ACROSS THE SKY.  AS I WAS WATCHING IT, I NOTICE I COULD NOT HEAR THE JET ANYMORE.  SO I WONDERED WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS. IF I HELD MY HAND OUT AT ARM'S LENGTH AND HAD MY INDEX FINGER AND THUMB ABOUT AN 1/4 INCH APART.  THAT IS HOW BIG THE OBJECT LOOKED.  I FIGURED I JUST SAW THE SPACE STATION JUST FLY OVER(?). WHAT EVER IT WAS IT MADE NO NOISE, AND HAD TO BE VERY BIG (IT WAS VERY HIGH IN THE SKY). IT CAME OUT OF THE NORTHWEST AND TRAVELED TO THE SOUTH EAST (WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A SPACE STATION FLY OVER.)   WE LIVE IN THE WOODS, TALL TREES SO THE OBJECT WAS NOT IN VIEW FOR VERY LONG (1 MIN - LESS)  SINCE THEN I HAVE HEARD OF SEVERAL REPORTS OF PEOPLE SEEING A AMBER OBJECT, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST LOG THE EVENT.;29.9897849785407;-95.2186158798282
