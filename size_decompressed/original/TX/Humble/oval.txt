ALL APPEARED FAIRLY LOW TO START, DID NOT MOVE LATERALLY IN ANMY DIRECTION, THEY JUST GOT SMALLER AS WE WATCHED. LOOKED LIKE OBJECTS JUST WENT HIGHER AT A VERY SLOW SPEED. OVAL OBJECT SEEMED TO HAVE A PROJECTION AT TOP AND BOTTOM AND SEEMED TO TUMBLE OVER AT SLOW SPEED. OBJECT WAS PRETTY FAR AWAY WHEN I GOT BINOCULARS BUT HAD BRILLIANT YELLOW BOTTOM AND SLIVERY TOP OR MAYBE THE OVAL ITSELF WAS SILVERY. OBJECTS STILL VISIBLE AS I'M TYPING THIS AT 5:15 pm HOUSTON TIME. DEFINATELY NOT AIRPLANE AS WE WATCHED SEVERAL AIRPLANES ENTERING GLIDE PATH TO HOUSTON IAH AIRPORT. OBJECTS JUST SEEMED TO STAY IN ONE PLACE AND GET SMALLER AS IT ROSE UP. DEFINATELY NOT BIRDS, BALLOONS, SATELIGHTS, STARS OR OTHER PLANET TYPE OBJECTS.;29.9897849785407;-95.2186158798282

We are near IAH and at first he thought it was a plane, then at further inspection knew it wasn't. He ran in our home and told me to hurry and get outside to see whatever this was. It appeared to be light in color, no lights and ocassionally a wing like thing seemed to flap. It just kept going higher. I had retrieved the binoculars and we tried to see but they kept fogging and were unsuccessful. It just kept going higher and disappeared into the clouds. Very unsettling. We are educated upper management senior citizens, this is not a dupe.;29.9897849785407;-95.2186158798282
