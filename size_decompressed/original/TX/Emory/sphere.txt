Was watching a very faint satellite track south to north when it reflected sun extremely bright for two seconds near the northern horizon, duplicating the earlier experience. You may close out my earlier report as known and would appreciate removing the earlier post from the net. Regards, ((name deleted));32.8776;-95.7431
