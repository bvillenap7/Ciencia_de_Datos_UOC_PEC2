I was in my backyard relaxing after some yardwork.  The weather was scattered clouds with a very strong south wind, about 30 mph.  Movement caught my eye in the eastern sky.  As I focused I saw a reddish orange colored egg shaped object traveling north to south flying very fast into the wind.   It was about 200 feet above the ground and close.  The object appeared to be slightly smaller than the size of a compact car, made no sound and was not lighted or shiny. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.
