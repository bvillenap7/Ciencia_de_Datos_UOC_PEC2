White ball as big as pencil eraser in hand with halo at first. Bright white like sun fading in intensity until dissapeared in NW sky. Very slow movement down, like it was coming almost head on. No tail or sound or smoke. Not an aircraft. I was outside in the country (no background light) looking for shooting stars when I noticed a bright light in the corner of my eye. Turning to the North I was amazed to see the brightest object in a night sky I can remember. The round object was moving very slow, and it was so bright it was lighting the air around it giving it the appearance of a halo. As it decended the halo disappeared and the ball faded out in a linear fashion, keeping its original size as it darkened. I told my wife about it and when I heard the other reports coming in last night 9-23-98 it reminded me of my experience and I thought it might be interesting to others. My background is degree in physics, retired from semiconductor industry and 43 years as a ham radio operator - K5BTV.;32.8776;-95.7431
