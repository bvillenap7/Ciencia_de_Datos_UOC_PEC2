Boomerang shaped figure seen with a red hue!;2003-08-30 01:30:00;5 minutes;Boomerang shaped figure seen with a red hue! My wife and I were stargazing at approxamately 1:30a.m.on the night of August 30. It was then that I saw a boomerang shaped figure traveling southwest. The figure had no audible engine noise emmiting from it and was riding quite slow. It paused for about 5 seconds then continued flying another ten seconds. It then again paused for another 3 seconds and continued flying on a south west bound course. I tried getting my wife to notice what I was looking at but she says saw nothing. About 3 minutes later I noticed the same object was traveling south, as if going towards the Brownsville direction. This time both my wife and I noticed the object, only this time it had a strange red hue to it. We continued looking at the UFO traveling south until it was no longer visible. This event made me quite nervous as I am not a firm believer in UFO's but it will forever change the way I look at the night sky!!!;26.1372;-97.6453999999999
