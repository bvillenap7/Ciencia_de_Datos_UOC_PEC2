UFO looks like plane, previous UFO light sphere see.;2015-11-12 21:30:00;15 seconds;UFO looks like plane, previous UFO light sphere see One night this past month, my boyfriend and I were driving out to my parents' house. As we drove down the road we always drive down, we could see a plane right above us. Literally we were driving underneath this thing that looked like a plane (from the bottom). We were able to look up at it as we passed it, it just hovered there.  That's when we figured it's a UFO.  No plane on earth can hover that low to the ground.   A few months before, about 6, I witnessed what I also believe to be a UFO.  Late night driving once again to my parents, I caught eye to a white light above our neighbors house.  In all honesty it looked like an enormous round light.  I couldn't see any edges or outline of a craft.  It was just pure light.   By the time I realized what I was seeing, I turned around to drive back and get another look it was gone.  I haven't seen any light since, so I now confirm it truly a UFO sighting.  Hope y'all enjoy my experiences. It's nice having someone to talk to. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));26.1372;-97.6453999999999
