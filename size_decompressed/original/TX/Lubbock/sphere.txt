Green spherical object with no trails of light behind it suggesting that it could have been a shooting star.;2008-10-06 22:30:00;3.8 seconds;Green spherical object with no trails of light behind it suggesting that it could have been a shooting star. The object that was sighted was neon green in color, spherical, and traveled in a straight line at an angle to the ground. The object was roughly the size of a BB when held at arms length relative to the surrounding environment. It behaved like a shooting star but the shape stayed too consistent and there were no trails of light behind it suggesting that it could be some kind of shooting star. The light was sharp neon green in color and we were traveling northbound on Slide road toward the mall right before the intersection for loop 289 when we sighted the object. I could not have confused this with any other color and the green light was even glowing through street lights and I could clearly distinguish between the white street lamp and the green object.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
Hovering glowing objects, strategically line up and travel west.;2012-02-05 21:10:00;5-10 MINUTES;hovering glowing objects, strategically line up and travel west. About 21:15 my family and I came outside to leave to our respective homes and my brother started yelling to look up in the sky just above the house at 4 large glowing round shapes in the sky.   We all looked and saw theses objects.  They were as high up as a small plane or helicopter would fly but the lights were much much larger in comparison to actual plane or helicopter lights.  They were just hanging out in a V line for about a minute, then the point positioned object took off straight up in the sky, the remaing objects lined up and traveled from east to west at a fast speed then disappeared.   We had 3 iphones out video taping andtaking pictures as best we could.  We also had a friend that lives about 30 miles south call and tell us he saw a hovering object west of his home.  Then disappear.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
