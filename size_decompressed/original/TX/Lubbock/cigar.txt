The object was hidden in a cloud.;1992-10-15 18:00:00;20-30 minutes;The object was hidden in a cloud. We notice a single cloud in the sky.  The cloud disappeared and the cigar shaped object could be seen. The object moved close enough to see windows on the object. The color seem to be a little grey and I didn't see any lights.  It had no wings but could move rather fast.  The fog/cloud started to reappear again and the object disappeared.  We watched the object about 20 minutes before it disappeared.  The next day I called the nearest Air Force Base to report it.  They made me feel like I was crazy reporting this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
