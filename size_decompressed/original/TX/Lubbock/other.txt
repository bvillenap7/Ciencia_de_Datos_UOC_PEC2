2ft Square , 5 Sided Black Box;1986-04-15 15:00:00;5 minutes;2ft Square , 5 Sided Black Box About 1986 I had been a student in a junior college at a Lubbock annex , it was around 3:00 in the afternoon. At the time I lived with my parents south of Lubbock about 4 miles out. A fairley populated residential area. As I was driving home on County Road 1585 to turn South on South University Ave , I had notice from a mile away a BLACK object that looked like a kite. As I got closer to my turn I noticed no one flying the KITE and once about 100 ft away I could see it to be a Black Box . Out of curiosity I drove past University Ave and pulled the car over and got out. There are power line along the road way, as I wathced this object I could see it had only 5 sides, I could see inside the BLACK box. I observed this box as it floated a few feet over the power lines, decend , reverse direction and do a full circle of the power lines. Keep in mind, I am directly under this object in broad daylight. as the object reaccended it then resummed its coarse and continued in a southern direction with a gradual climb. I rushed to the house to notify my mother but by the time i had gotten there , less than 1/2 mile away , the object was so high and far way she could only see a dot. I was wondering if anyone else had ever reported seeing anything like this. ((name and e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

sleepover. flashing lights. blankets ripped off bed. tall thin figures spoke to us. abduction. woke with strange triangular marks on ;1997-12-12 02:03:00;bedroom;Summary : sleepover. flashing lights. blankets ripped off bed. tall thin figures spoke to us. abduction. woke with strange triangular marks on our bodies that vanished within hours. constant feeling of being watched. S.O.S. Me and my friend are 14 years old.  We had stayed up late studying for finals.  We went to bed at about 12 and stayed up till about 1 afeter talking about school.  At about 2 we were both awakened suddenly to a strange silence and bright flashing lights out side the window.  We both remember a sence of absolute shock and severe fright, when our covers were suddenly and yet gently drawn from our beds.  At the foot of my bed I saw a   the silouette of a tall thin figure with  large black eyes that had a shiney luster to them, it was as if I could see myself in them,(after this moment I regret to say that the rest is the account of my friend because I cannot remember anything else)......I looked over at Patty and I remember thinking that she was dead because she lie so still.  her body began to rise above the bed into the arms of the figure described above. I also was carried into the figures arms, but i did not pass out. Before I knew it, we were in a different place that is defficult to describe because i was surrounded by these figures.  I was laying on a strange surface that was both hot and cold at the same time. It felt as if there was a sheet over my body put there so that i could not move.  The only part of my body that i could move was my eyes.  I did not see Patty anywhere, until the beings parted for a split second, and i caught sight of them carrying her body out of the room, i was sure she was dead. i then directed my eyes toward the celing and saw an  object slowly and silently descending toward my stomach.  It resembled a very large needle, and it was then that i fainted.  i awoke in the morning laying beside Patty on the kitchen floor. We vaguely (at first) remembered what had happened.  We noticed three strange triangular marks on our bodies--one behind the left ear, one on our stomachs, and one on our lower back.  Now Patty and i feel that if we ever separate after this experience together, somthing bad will happen.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
See-thru UFO's?;1998-09-15 20:00:00;5 minutes;See-thru UFO's? My sighting if you want to call it that, happened 12 years ago.  I just recently found this website and thought I would post the experience.  Again I'm not sure what I saw but I know it wasn't anything that could be explained at the time. One night I decided to go outside and cool off on the patio.  I looked up and started to star gaze to pass the time when I noticed that the stars' pattern flickered in and out almost like someone was moving a huge rectangle of glass across the sky.  The size of the anomaly was pretty decent, about the size of a large passenger air plane.  The weird thing about this is that there was no sound distortion in the air, so I knew it wasn't a plane or big helicopter, and there was no wind so it wasn't as if there was some strange item blowing across the sky. I watched the glass-rectangle thing start to cross the horizon, it looked almost as if it paused, then moved again in stops and starts.  I decided then to go inside to grab something to assist in viewing it better like my binoculars or video camera, but when I came out the pattern was gone.  There were no lights, no oblong shapes, no sudden heat, and no repeat of what I saw.  Just thought I'd send this up in case anyone had ever seen something like this before.

Meteor looking object, very bright. Visible only 2 seconds after which it vanished. Suspected meteor however it's trajectory was North ;1999-09-29 07:02:00;2 seconds;Meteor looking object, very bright. Visible only 2 seconds after which it vanished. Suspected meteor however it's trajectory was North to south. At 7:02 am I was traveling on my way home on S Loop 289 heading east when I suddenly saw a bright light approximately the intensity of Landing lights on an aircraft. The light was at a 30 degree inclination, traveling North to south very quickly, covering a distance of 5 inches on my windshield in 1 second. It left no contrail, no exhaust trail or any heat variances visible against the sky which was beginning to light up due to the rising sun (not visible yet). The western sky was still a very dark blue/black. The object left a light trail, such as seen on meteors entering the atmosphere and disappeared as suddenly as it appeared which is why I suspect it is a meteor. However it was very bright for your usual meteors and left no trail in the sky whatsoever. Again there was a north south heading as well.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
No outline of the ship, just appeared as six lights moving at great speeds, Great Speed!;2006-02-27 10:17:00;3 sec.;No outline of the ship, just appeared as six lights moving at great speeds, Great Speed! I couldnt see an actual outline of the UFO, just lights. There were two pairs of lights, each pair containing three lights, so a total of six. They were moving at incredible speeds, but i couldnt judge if it was close or far, it was at night and the lights were dim. They werent dim as in distance, but as if they were meant to camoflouge with the night. When i saw the lights they were like so  ... ...       . but after about 2 seconds into the sightings they split, appearing as such     ... . . The two pair kept their speeds and aligned perfectly, then they dissapeared into the night, almost fading into the night.

Green Light in the sky over Lubbock, TX.;2012-08-07 00:35:00;10 minutes;Green Light in the sky over Lubbock, TX. I went outside to smoke in my backyard.  I looked at the moon and nearby was a BRIGHT green star.  Then it dissapeared for about 5 seconds.  And suddenly re-appeared in a different spot. The light then moved from left to right.. side to side randomly and faster than you would expect of a plane.  I called my parents out of bed and they came out and watched it for the next 5-10 minutes as it moved about the sky blinking on and off.  The blinking was completely random... sometimes staying on for 20 seconds.. sometimes just 2 seconds.  It eventually went behind some trees and we could not see it anymore.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259

It seems normal, like as if plane tracers.  Then it seems like something is flying side by side, then behind the FIRST trail at the top something starts flowing brighter (as if it's being fired on or speeding up possibly?)  Then flashing sequence lights seem to come out of ...well nowhere but around in proximity to the first trail O-o.  Honestly, I am stumped.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
