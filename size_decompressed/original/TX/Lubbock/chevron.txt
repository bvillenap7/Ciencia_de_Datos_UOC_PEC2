Object southbound, displaying three white lights, slowed, hovered, quickly accelerated and made a low, banking turn to the east and the;1998-12-16 19:40:00;3 minutes;Object southbound, displaying three white lights, slowed, hovered, quickly accelerated and made a low, banking turn to the east and then sped north until out of sight. Witness #1 saw three white lights in sky at approximately 19:20CST.  The lights appeared stationary and witness thought the lights were an inbound airliner at a distance thus accounting for the lights seeming to hover.  At approximately 19:40CST, witness #1 and witness #2 were traveling in a vehicle together when the object was again seem southbound over the southwest part of Lubbock.  The object slowed, hovered, and then accelerated to the south, making a low sweeping turn to the east, completing the 180 degree turn to the north and sped out of sight.  When the witnesses pulled off the street to look at the object, they heard it making a pulsing humming sound.  The radio in their automobile was tuned to an FM station.  Something else came over the radio at a louder volume.  Mixed in with the FM broadcast was a louder voice speaking in English.  It seemed to be one side of a two-way conversation, not unlike a telephone call.  The object was very dark or black.  Witness #1 is very familiar with civil and military aircraft and stated that he had never seen anything like this before.  I am reporting this incident for my daughter (witness #2) and her fiance (witness #1).  If you want to contact me call digital pager 806((number deleted)).  I will return your call as soon as possible.  The below number is my office telephone number where I can be contacted 0830-1700CST, Mon-Fri.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259

On October 5th, 2014, three people sighted a white looking chevron in the sky above Lubbock , Texas.....It seemed to be about 40,000 miles up, at least.  It appeared to move back and forth in the sky and had a bright circular light in the center of the chevron object. It was witnessed for 15-20 minutes in the sky,,turning back and forth..We had never seen anything like it before in the sky. I am a 58 year old, retired heavy equipment operator.
