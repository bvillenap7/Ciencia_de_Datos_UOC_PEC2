cylinder shaped object floating in the sky and then drifting off;2007-06-18 21:10:00;15 min;cylinder shaped object floating in the sky and then drifting off I was walking outside and just happened to look up at the moon toward the west and saw a very dark object with a cylinder shape overall. At first I thought it might be some balloons in the sky, but they did not bob and weave like balloons I've watched float away. It sat still for about 3-4 minutes, then began moving very slowly to the south. It had no lights, and as it very slowly moved it seemed to also be moving up and away so that it became smaller and smaller. I was franticly trying to get my digital camera to work, but the batteries were dead, and every time I looked down at it, I could barely find the object again against the darkening sky. Finally it just drift completely out of sight.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
