We live across the street from a golf course.  We were watching the sky for the Hale- Bopp Comet and we suddenly saw a triangular shaped object hovering over the entire area.  It was large, we could see lights all around flickering with a bright yellow green color.  We were in shock at first and then began to study the object.  It was low to the ground but not so low it would hit a wire.  I could see into its systems.  This craft had a lot of new mechanisms.  I could see things flashing inside that appeared to be advanced technology.  Having grown up overseas in the tropics with a father who was a flight simulator instructor, I have seen many things in the skies.  This resembled nothing I had ever seen before or ever again.   There was no noise whatsoever.  The craft maintained it's position for what seemed to me to be a couple of minutes.  It then shot out of the area in a blink of an eye. I have never seen anything move  so quickly.  I returned into the house to get my husband. He was worried about me because we had been gone for over 25 minutes. Time had escaped both of us. When the entire family returned outside it was gone, much to their dismay.  I called Reese AFB and asked if they were conducting anything unusual and they replied no flight out. I called the University of Texas Tech to inquire what it could have been. They blew me off with some cooky it was the comets tail.  Well I have seen my share of comets and their tails and this was no tail.  I watched a special about Arizona Lights and it resembled quite closely to what I had seen. That is why I wrote to you.

Black triangle with three solid white lights and a forth blinking light in the center of the other three solid lights.;1997-04-10 23:00:00;30 minutes;Black triangle with three solid white lights and a forth blinking light in the center of the other three solid lights. I was working at a grocery store as a grocery sacker at the time of the sighting.  The grocery store that I worked at had a parking lot in the front of the store and an secondary parking lot on the side of the building.   As I was taking a customer's groceries too their car in the secondary parking lot, I looked up and saw three solid lights in triangle formation with a fourth blinking light in the center of the three solid lights.  It seemed to be a solid craft because it blocked out the stars behind it.   It moved too slow to be an airplane or a helicopter and it was completely silent.  It seemed to move off to the east from my location very slowly.   As I would carry out more groceries, I would look to the east and see it moving slowly out of sight.   After about thirty minutes, it was out of sight.  I told no one what I saw, save one of my fellow sacker, who immediately began mocking (playfully) the whole event.

That was no falling  star!!;2010-04-03 01:00:00;5 SECONDS;That was no falling  star!! I was driving southwest on a calm clear night,coming on to an overpass.The overpass gave me good sight,because it was a high bridge,due to going over train tracks.While at the top ,I noticed a bright blue,I thought it was a falling star or peace of meteor.but the speed of it falling gave me a good look,as it looked to be slower than a usual falling star.                                                                        This blue glowing triangle ,the color of plasma sparkles coming off of it.As it caught my attention, I remember saying wow!!! But what it did next,really blew me away.From wow to what the hell!!!                                                                 This was not a falling star. It looked large .In the glow ,I could make out the outline of a triangle.But with the corners being rounded.                                       I thought I was  going to see it crash into the earth. But it did an L shape move .A perfect stop and lets go t! his way.But real fast,like the shape of a carpenters level .Direction toward the west.Disappeared into the darkness.Toward New Mexico.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259

Triangle object with blinking red, green, and white lights seen in telescope.;2018-06-03 00:25:00;5 minutes;Triangle object with blinking red, green, and white lights seen in telescope. At 12:25AM I was using my small spotting scope to look at objects such as Saturn and Jupiter in the night sky.  I first saw the object east of Saturn at the time.  Object could just be seen as three blinking/strobing lights that were red, green, and white.   At first glance I thought it was a airplane with strobing lights.  I soon became aware this was not the case. As an amateur astronomer I had clear reference points to track the object and knowledge of satellite activity and meteors.  The speed in which the object was traveling was comparable to the speed of the International Space Station.  Faster than any plane I have ever seen.  It also did not travel in a straight line as most aircraft would, instead it traveled closely to the ecliptic line in the sky that night first passing Saturn and then passing Jupiter at relatively proportional distance as it did Saturn.  Object was first spotted in the SE and “set” in the west.  Its lights were rapid blinking at ten times the rate as most aircraft strobe lights do.  One would think it would be a satellite however this was not the case.   When I first spotted the object and made the deduction that it was not an aircraft I trained my spotting scope (one powerful enough to see the lines of Jupiter) on the object.  At minimal magnification it was clear the object was triangular (sketch of object will be included in the report).  I followed the object for about thirty seconds zooming in magnification to get a clear representation of what the craft’s outline looked like.  As I stated it was clearly triangular with lights on the edges of the triangle.  If this were to be a satellite with my scopes magnification (one I have tested on the International Space Station before) if the object was at the altitude of the space station would be easily twenty times the size of it.  I lost the object from my scope around the time it was passing Jupiter and used the naked eye for the rest of the viewing.  I cannot explain what this object was, but am 90% sure it was not a satellite or aircraft.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259

v shaped faint red lights moving below Sirris;2020-01-05 21:59:00;4 seconds;v shaped faint red lights moving below Sirris While looking at Star Sirris I noticed faint red lights in a V shape moving below Sirris 260 degrees west moving north.  The event only lasted 6 seconds. There appeared to be more lights on the outer side, there were only red lights, no flashing lights, no sound.  It just vanished.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
Triangular craft with lights spotted hovering in the sky in early morning hours.;2021-01-27 07:00:00;5 min;Triangular craft with lights spotted hovering in the sky in early morning hours. Driving East on HW 62 toward Lubbock around 7:00 a I spotted a UFO that looked like a stationary triangle just hovering in the air pretty low to the ground but above the power lines.  I noticed red and blue lights underneath the craft.  As I pulled over to the shoulder of the road it started to move very slowly across the sky.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
