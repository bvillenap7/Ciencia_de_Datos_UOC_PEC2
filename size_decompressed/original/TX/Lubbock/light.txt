Upon leaving the hospital I noticed a ball of light in the sky. You can see by the time I entered that it was about 7:35 pm or so just before day turns to night. I observed the object fixed in the sky. There was no sound or movement which is what struck me the most. It was a blue color that did shine very bright the starts had not yet appeared in the sky so I could dismiss that very quickly. I stared at the object for many moments till I finally had to leave to go fill a rx for my son.  I ended up at the pharmacy with the object in sight the whole time while at the pharmacy I allowed my wife to go fill it for me so I could watch this object. Moments later the light seemed to have released a 2nd light from the initial craft that was much smaller than the first. It seemed to be lowering it down from the primary craft. It was also glowing but more so a clear light. Then off in the distance I noticed a plane moving toward the object. Then glanced back to the ufo and both lights began to dim until they were no longer visible to the eye.  Local news would have us beleive this to be a weather baloon but it did not move at all or change its position and this does not explain the 2nd object I viewed either. there were many photos taken and many eye witnesses to this event including the ones I named along with my supervisor and co-workers. I have a photo I can text message to you if you like. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259

2 Bright Lights in the West Texas;2011-09-23 18:00:00;2 hours roughly;2 Bright Lights in the West Texas Friday, September 23, 2011 I was on facebook when I saw someone posted something in Levelland, Texas on 'Facebook' referring for everyone to go outside and look into the northern sky. So I did, and I saw 2 bright objects. They looked circular in shape, and look like they were just sitting there in the sky, noy moving, not flying, not blinking nothing. Just one bright light and another bright light. At first they sort of resembled stars, but way brighter. So I looked around it was pretty bright out when these two lights were in the sky, and there were absolutely no stars in the sky. But I still thought maybe they were stars or planets maybe glowing in the sky from the sun. I eventually watched these two objects until the sun started to set. This is where I could determine if these two objects were. As I saw this I realized this was unique, a maybe once in a lifetime chance to see something like this. So I grab my cellphone for my camera because my actual came! ra is broken, and I took two pictures along with a video. As the sun set, the darkness started to take over and eventually the first light would just dim away, as would the second. That is how I knew they were not stars.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
Sighting over Lubbock;2013-05-08 22:00:00;3 minutes;Sighting over Lubbock I was on my balcony smoking a cigarette when I was looking up at the sky.  I saw one white light being followed closely behind by what to me looked like an aircraft with a blinking red light.  Further behind the two ufos was another white light moving in the same direction as the other two.  They were all three headed from NE to SW.   As the objects moved a little further away the two white lights slowly faded out and dissappeared while the red flashing light remained on and continued on the same path.  The lights didn't fade because of distance but just faded out.  This is the third time I have seen this same occurrence.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
Star that moves, fades, changes into multiple lights.;2014-01-24 20:00:00;3 minutes;star that moves, fades, changes into multiple lights I have seen this many times.  First time, I thought it was a star, then realized it was a little too low, too bright, and was moving, floating alongside my car.  When I stopped, it came to a stop in front of me.  When I made a right turn, and stopped and looked in front of me, there it was again.  I would return to the spot I saw it the first time, and it was gone then return to the spot it was the second time and it was gone.  Sometimes I saw it vaporize like a cigarette ash, an orange/brown fading light, in an arc that fades.  Sometimes, I see in the place it was before it disappeared, and not moving, appx 4 lights, 2 red and 2 white.  So...it looks like a star that moves ... then changes to appear like an airplane that doesn't move.  Once, it flew directly over me when I was standing outdoors, no sound.  This started appx june 2013.  The star was in the same place nightly, usually appeared before dusk, and slowly sunk below the horizon around 10 pm.  I noticed it t! he first time when it first 'followed' my car and stopped in front of me when I stopped in june 2013.  It was in the north west sky, same spot, until recently.  I noticed around end of december it wasnt there anymore.  Then, a few days ago, as I was driving, there it was in a different direction.  I turned right into a parking lot and got out, looked up, and saw, in front of me, again, as if it was changing direction to stay in front of me, what was 2 red and 2 white lights, hovering, not moving, as if it had morphed into an airplane camoflage, then faded away.  It hasn't been in the NW sky since end of december 2013. This sounds like same thing Ive read in several other posts ... has there been an explanation posted anywhere?
