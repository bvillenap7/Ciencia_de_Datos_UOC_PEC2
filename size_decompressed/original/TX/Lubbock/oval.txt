((HOAX??))  Elliptical craft sighted on serpentine path in Lubbock, Texas.;2007-02-24 09:43:00;0:56;Elliptical craft sighted on serpentine path in Lubbock, Texas. Sitting watching TV when out the window my mother and I both saw this unidentified aircraft.  We ran outside to see the elliptical shape that had six light around its perimeter and three blinking red lights at the center.  It seemed to be pulsating and I heard a slight buzzing sound.  It was taking a serpentine path throught the night sky about 150 feet above the ground.  At first, it went over our house and curved along several blocks.  A few seconds later it was curving more slowly and disappeared behind a tree.  We attempted to resight the craft while running down the sidewalk.While running to the seen i noticed several car lights come on in the vacinity. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Possible hoax??

The enormous craft over lubbock texas.;2011-06-13 00:00:00;5 min;the enourmous craft over lubbock texas me and my brother were driving around one night and we no noticed two lights floating above the city in perfect synchronization, never moving closer together or farther apart from one another.  upon closer inspection we could both clearly see a misty oval shaped outline connecting the two lights.   this was puzzling because we could still see the stars in the middle of the craft which i myself have come to interpret as some sort of cloaking mechanism.  the most amazing features were the smoothness of its flight and its sheer size, it seemed to glide effortlessly with no need for high velocity,  it never left a single tracer as far as we could see,  must have been using a truly uncomprehendable propulsion system.  regardless of how high up the craft was exactly it was apparent that it was enormous where as a plane looks like a speck in the sky this thing was impressive in size it must have been half a mile long.  we didn't report it to the local authorities because if! they hadn't disregarded it as a hoax they would have had a tough time finding it,   i feel truly lucky to have witnessed such a thing and i truly believe that one day all the people who have been laughed at or made out to be pranksters and liars will be the ones laughing in the end.   the universe is indescribably huge and still expanding, i find it an ignorant thought process to think we are the only ones living in this space time continuum.   whether or not this craft was extra terrestrial or not cant be known, my assumptions lead me to believe it was.  thank you for reading.
