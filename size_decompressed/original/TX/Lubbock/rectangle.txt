I was aiming my mini-camcorder, which I had purchased just days earlier, at the moon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Object in lens of camera?  PD));2013-01-24 22:17:00;55 seconds;On Jan 24, 2013, @ 10:17 PM, I was aiming my mini camcorder, which I had purchased just days earlier, at the moon.  When I focused on the moon, at about 20X zoom, there was an object hovering in the lower left quadrant of the moon.  The length was about 1/8 to 1/6 of the moon diameter. I first thought it was a speck of dust in or on the lens.  Later inspection did not confirm that. The distance from my camcorder to the object was unknown.  If it  was close to the moon, the size must have been gigantic. If it was close to Earth, there would likely have been a greater relative movement to the moon, but not necessarily true. My video clip is 55 sec long.  Check out my two screen shots (still pics) from the clip. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a copy of the video.  The object appears to us to be some kind of foreign object in the lens assembly, but that is pure conjecture, at this stage.  PD));33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
Wired objects in West Texas.;2016-03-27 18:00:00;2 hours;wired objects in West Texas On this day, at first one object caught my eye.  That shined and hovered in place for about a 5 mins.  Then it moves the opposite direction and fade away and a few minutes latter two show in formation and hovered also above this another object much higher was a very large air craft which it held it position.  and accented ((sic.  Ascended??)) higher till no longer to see but the two turned to three.  Then headed south for about two miles then west for 20 mins. and headed up and disappeared.  I know that these were not airliners or bombers.  cause the shape and also other aircrafts flying for east to west.. and  his objects were heading in a different direction. very bizarre.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
