Strange lights sighted and then airplane with no lights sighted.;2013-11-26 23:00:00;Ongoing;Strange lights sighted and then airplane with no lights sighted. I spotted this with my naked eyes while looking for ison.  It was east south east of the city.  At first I chalked it off as an aircraft but I got my binoculars and upon further examination I could see many colors.  Sort of like a cops lights on but there are many more colors. I set my binocs on the side of my truck to steady them and could still see many colors.  Blue, red, green, violet, amber and possibly yellow all rotating around a central point. I'm watching it now and it is not moving.  Other than the lights.   It has maintained its position for a few hours now. Also their is a blacked out airplane flying circles overhead. The local airport is across town maybe 20 miles. I thought it was a helicopter but it is an airplane.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259

Bright white beam shot towards me while floating white lit craft hovers 2 and a half feet above back yard.;2021-04-26 03:00:00;15 minutes;Bright white beam shot towards me while floating white lit craft hovers 2 and a half feet above back yard. It was around 1:00 in the morning.I woke up thirsty for a drink so I went into the kitchen to get some water when I noticed a strange white light through the blinds of my window facing the backyard. I set my drink down on the table while I opened the back door leading to the backyard. While I was walking down the concrete path that lead to the end of my back yard to take a closer look at what was going on I heard a foot step in the immediate vicinity. Obviously shooken up I made a b line towards the door which I exited only to be hit by this paralyzing beam of white light. Next thing I know I'm back in my kitchen sitting upright in my chair. All seemed normal until I looked at the clock on the kitchen stove and saw the time was 5:00 am. Not wanting to bring any unwanted attention to myself I decided to keep it quite for the rest of the school day until what happend next. Being a accomplished track runner for my high school I normally find it easy to not get ! fatigued or have anything unusual happen after I'm exhausted Today was unique in that after I felt absolutely sick to my stomich.I told my coach I wasn't feeling well and he let me go use the bathroom.As soon as I made it I threw up in the toilet but this was no normal looking vomit. It had a solid blue like texture and before I knew it this unusual bug like thing was sitting right there on the bottom of the toilet bowl before crawling down the pipe. I believe there was some type of experiment used on me maybe even containing the creature also known formally as the face hugger. Being the dumb guy I am i still considered to keep this to myself since anybody else would not belief me and think I'm crazy.I tried to get photographic evidence but the creature that came out of my mouth moved to fast. As of typing this I have never experienced such a crazy event in my life and still have trouble believing what happend to me. I can't explain why but I did not feel any fatigue at all! while running and was questioned by everyone why I didn't see! m exuast ed like the rest of the group. Whatever that was that came out of me must have left some type of effect that delays the exhaustion period after physical excersion.It is not my intent to spread false information and would never try to trick the person reading this into something thats simply not true. I just want to encourage anybody else that has experienced the same type of events that happend to me to not be afraid to pubically admit it before it is to late. The only power these creatures have over us is the ability to make us doubt our own memory. I hope everyone who is reading this does not have to go through the same events as I did and never have to come in contact with these horryfying beings.;33.5466679104477;-101.899830348259
