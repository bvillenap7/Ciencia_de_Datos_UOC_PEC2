30 minutes. Pulsing lights, unknown shape. Texas;2011-11-03 00:00:00;30 minutes;30 minutes. Pulsing lights, unknown shape. Texas Myself (homemaker), and my mother (homemaker) was standing outside in the driveway.  It was sunset, when in the sky to the south we noticed a pulseing light.  It seemed to be over Pantex.             I went inside the house to get the biniculars to get a closer look at it, thinking it might be a weather balloan.                          I was able to see it clearly, and it was solid,disk shape on the top with four lights, and a triangle at the bottom.               It would flip upside down, lay on its side, and then go upright again.  My mother looked also and it was doing the same thing when she saw it.                          Also, it had red, green and yellow pulsating lights.  It stayed in the same place for about 25 minutes, and then it started to lower down.  My mother called a friend (elementary teacher) of the family on the other side of town and she also saw it.                     Then it begin to move away going east slowly, that is when we observed 4 aircraft moving towards it.  It just disappeared after that.;35.3818;-101.4247
