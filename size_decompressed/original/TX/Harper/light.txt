White light moving West to East at a high rate of speed.;2017-02-15 19:50:00;10 seconds;White light moving West to East at a high rate of speed. The object was seen traveling from west to east at a high rate of speed either in the upper atmosphere or in space.  It was a brilliant white and then disappeared in the earth's shadow.  It moved approximately 3x faster than the ISS does when it is able to be seen.   I grew up around the Sierra Nevada in Central CA, been around Edwards AFB, worked as a firefighter on a helicopter throughout the Western United States, and am currently a teacher.  I know what I saw, and this vehicle was moving incredibly fast for the altitude it was traveling at.
