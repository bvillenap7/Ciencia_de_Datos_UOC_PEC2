Bright object over HWY 290 Hempstead, TX;2005-10-06 18:50:00;10 min;Bright object over HWY 290 Hempstead, TX I had just turned onto HWY 290 W/B from FM2920 with the top down on my jeep when I noticed what looked like a slow moving shooting star directly over head going W/B at extremely high altitude.  Object was very distant but bright.   A small cloud obstructed my view and the object did not reappear on the other side of the cloud as it should have at the speed it was travelling.  About two minutes later the object reappeard on the same course and speed.  Shooting stars don't stop !  The object banked right going N/W and the side of it became visable.  It was long with dots along the side.  NOT AN AIRPLANE!  Too far away for any clear view.  Object faded from view but reappeared in a location inconsistant with its privious direction of travel.  It was either highly reflective or emmiting a bright light.  I stopped to watch it and 5 - 7 people saw me looking and then also noticed the object that they immediately called a UFO.   An airliner transversed the sky traveling S/E at high altitiude but lower than the object and had NO resemblence to the object.  Lighting conditions were early evening, still daylight and partly cloudy. incident lasted approximately 10 minutes.;30.092;-96.0649
