Central Texas. Object tracking along side the ISS off its port side, emitting repetitive white and blue pulses of light.;2020-10-10 19:45:00;1 minute;Central Texas. Object tracking along side the ISS off its port side, emitting repetitive white and blue pulses of light. While watching the space station track from the NW to the SE over central Texas, I noticed a ufo that I estimate to be approximately 20 miles to the (East) of the ISS and following it in synchronized formation at 15,000+ mph. The UFO produced a bright white & blue glow about every 3 seconds, but in between the flashes the ufo was illuminated by sunlight but to a lesser degree of intensity than the intensity during its alternating white & blue flashes. It made no sound. And I estimate that it was near the 250 mile high orbit as the ISS.  I watched it for about one minute until both objects disappeared into the earths shadow, though the pulses from the UFO continued to be visible for about another 15 seconds until clouds obscured my view. The UFO was diamond shape, and appeared about twice the size of the area of the ISS illuminated by the sun.  I am 53,and have been flying airplanes for 37 years, and helicopters for 30 years. I have never seen anything like this.;30.7026013245033;-96.3553635761589
