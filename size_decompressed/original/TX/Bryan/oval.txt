Shining Bright Light, Oval Shaped, no sound;1979-09-15 18:00:00;15-20 min;Shining Bright Light, Oval Shaped, no sound This has been on my mind for over two decades.   I was a young boy apox 11-12 years old.  It was toward the of the end of summer as the days were beginning to get shorter. I remember playing in the front yard.  I lived in the Oaks. Its mostly mid-class families.  The sky was gray and somewhat cool as it gets in Texas towards the evening time.  I was on the corner of where our yard where we lived at Briar Oaks and well the cross street was Carter Creek, well it turns into Carter Creek at the Curb by the Royal Oaks Racket Club use to be.   I saw a Bright light hovering above our yard. It as I could tell somewhat oval shaped as the light resemble a floucent light color but much brighter.  I describe it as oval shape as that was how the light extended.   I watched it for- it felt like a long time probably between 10 to 15 min.  It didn't appear to be very high maybe 1 to 2 football fields high. I wanted to get a ladder and get a closer look.  After several minutes of watching it, I remember my neck hurting from staring into the sky for so long.  There was no sound and the craft was just hovering with No moment.   I remember running inside a telling my mom.  I ask if we had some binoculars to get a closer look.   She said No we didn't. I told her she had to come outside to see it.   Once back outside it was gone.   Later that night I remember telling my mom that we had to watch KBTX Channel 3 to see if anyone else saw it.  The weather man did say something.  I thought that was awesome.  He stated that several other people called in that night about a bright light in the sky.   He laughed, joking and said we all hope it was just a weather balloon with no real explanation.   I hope someone in that neighorhood who saw what I did will also post there experience that day.  I am very surpised with the number of calls the news recieved no one else has placed anything on this website.   I am currently 34 years old and been serving in the US Army for over 15 years.  Everything from that day has kept me wondering for a very long time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in 1979.

Flat oval disk-like object twisting and turning in place in the sky, then stabilized and flew away out of sight.;2017-02-17 08:30:00;45 seconds;Flat oval disk-like object twisting and turning in place in the sky, then stabilized and flew away out of sight. I arrived at work and was walking across the parking lot toward my office building when I noticed what I thought was a small airplane banking back and forth in the sky to the northwest. I thought maybe it was a stunt plane, but then I noticed it had a flat oval disk-like shape, twisting and turning in place.  I continued to walk across the parking and for a short period the object was eclipsed by the building, so I walked around to the side to get a better look. The object was still there.  For half a second, I though maybe it was a bird soaring in the wind as there was a pretty good breeze blowing, but it appeared to be hovering in place, although it was twisting and turning - plus, it had a definite oval shape. A few seconds later, it stopped turning and exited away to the north/northwest until in was no longer visible. I can't say with certainty that there isn't a prosaic explanation for what the object was, but it was strange.  Possibly a drone, but unlikely with how it was turning over in the sky and then just flew away. As best as I can tell, the object was maybe about 300 yards away, about 35 to 40 degrees in elevation from my position.;30.7026013245033;-96.3553635761589
