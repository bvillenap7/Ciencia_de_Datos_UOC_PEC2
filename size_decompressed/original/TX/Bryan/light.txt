Standing outside in backyard talking with adult nephew.  Facing northeast.  What we saw appeared over Highway 6 and William J Bryan.  Witnessed a white bright light that moved from north to east in a lateral line.  This light lasted i more than two seconds.  Initially our brain registered a falling star but quickly realized this object moved laterally.  It was not a falling star.  It did not leave a trail or make any sound.   Approximately one minute after seeing this light, a helicopter, which we could hear, rose up in the night sky and went east.
