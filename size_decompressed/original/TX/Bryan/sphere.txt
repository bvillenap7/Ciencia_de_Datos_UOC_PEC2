Silver sphere hovered, changed shape, then disappeared.;2017-05-24 07:12:00;5-10 seconds;Silver sphere hovered, changed shape, then disappeared. On May 24th, 2017, at approximately 07:12 AM CST, I was driving SE on SH 47 (Riverside Parkway) in Bryan, TX.  Just before taking my exit (HSC Parkway), I noticed a spherical, shimmering object hovering over the Snook, TX, area.  It appeared basketball in size, silverish in color, and at a high altitude (1-2 miles).  The angle on the horizon was approximately 75 degrees.  This is close to Easterwood airport, so I initially thought it was a plane, then maybe a helicopter.  However, the shape was not quite right. I was driving, so my attention wavered from the object to the road.  It was a bright, clear day and I noticed no unusual sounds or nearby objects.  As I was about halfway down the exit ramp, the object appeared to change shape into an oblong cylinder and then disappeared.  It left no trails or smoke.  The event lasted approximately 5-10 seconds.  Weather conditions were as follows:  Wind	, WNW, 9 mph Humidity	 65% Dew Point	 54° Pressure	 29.88 in Visibility	10.0 mi.   I have a master’s degree and am a middle aged male.  I have a good understanding of Astronomy and Physics.  I have seen videos of similar events, but was skeptical of them until now.  Whatever that object was, it defied the laws of Physics as we know it.;30.7026013245033;-96.3553635761589
