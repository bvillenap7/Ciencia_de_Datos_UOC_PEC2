25-30 foot circular object, no lights about 100-500 feet traveling very fast with no sound.;2019-10-22 00:10:00;3-4 seconds;25-30 foot circular object, no lights about 100-500 feet traveling very fast with no sound. I seen an object flying over my house from the East towards the West traveling very fast. I believe it was circular in shape 25-30 ft in diameter but not 100% certain. There could have been more of it that was not visible. No lights on it, the moonlight reflected on it and made it visible, no sound. Not sure how high in the air it was, but I believe it may have been 100 - 500 feet up. Happened very fast with just a little illumination from the moon.;30.7026013245033;-96.3553635761589
