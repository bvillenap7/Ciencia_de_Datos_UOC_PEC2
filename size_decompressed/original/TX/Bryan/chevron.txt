A dark brown/black colored craft passed over Bryan, Texas heading north and disappeared into the sky around 8:30 p.m.;2008-10-08 19:30:00;a few seconds;A dark brown/black colored craft passed over Bryan, Texas heading north and disappeared into the sky around 8:30 p.m. I was standing outside star gazing and a craft high up in the sky passed over me heading north. It looked to be either dark brown or black in color and was in the shape of a v (chevron shaped i presume). It was going fairly fast and disappeared into the sky. it couldn't have been ducks, because it was too high up in the sky and was a solid form. I became very excited because i have never seen something like this before. It occured around 8:30 p.m. central standard time.;30.7026013245033;-96.3553635761589
