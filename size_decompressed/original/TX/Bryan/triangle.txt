There was a pleasant breeze out of the south and the sky was clear and moonless.  I was approx. 16, and he was 15, and we were very up to date on known aircraft at that time.  We were watching the skys and out from the southeast moving northwest, we observed an aircraft with 3 colored lights, moving in a silent slow pace within what I was assuming normal jetliner height.  With the breeze coming from the same direction we saw the aircraft but, we never heard it.  Within 10 seconds after seeing the object the triangular patterened non-blinking lights on the craft turned off.  We both thought this was quite unusual and I began to track the craft with my right hand index finger extended under my right eye to judge the speed.  Approximately 7 seconds had elapesed and we heard the afterburner of a jet aircraft, with its light flashing, persuing directly behind the first craft.  I would say within 5 seconds of sighting the jet aircraft, the lights of the first craft turned back on and, to both myself and my friend's amazement, 2 more identically lighted aircraft zipped in on both sides of the lead aircraft making an arrowhead formation.  The three aircraft started to speed up and then make an extraordinary sharp 90 degree turn to the north/northeast. After the turn there level of speed was unbeleivable.  We raced to the right side of the house down the driveway and we saw all three aircraft dissapear within seconds.  We raced to the back yard where we saw the persuing jet just making it to the point where the three craft had meet.  The speed was just incrediable, in a blink they were gone.  From that day, my friend and I have seen each other only twice and we never talked about the event again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Somthing blocked out the star i was looking at,i lowered the binos and made out a large black triangle! It was moving so slow, no sound,very dim white lights in a circular fasion in the center of the object.  Was able to get the small 3 inch reflector scope on it briefly!  This thing was NOT from here!  My impression now is that it was very old.  It blended into the night sky perfectly.  So perfectly that this thing could have been circling our planet, slowly staying in the dark for ever! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Moving northwest to southeast, silently moving triangle shape. Blocked stars from view as if it were a triangular shadow moving across ;1999-09-14 21:45:00;10 to 15 sec;Moving northwest to southeast, silently moving triangle shape. Blocked stars from view as if it were a triangular shadow moving across the sky.  There was a grayish blue haze along the leading edge of the object. Standing outside my home, facing northwest, I was looking toward the west when I noted motion in the sky.  As we live near an airport, I looked for any lighting or markings.  All I could see was a shadow moving NW to SE and as it cleared the stars, I could make out it's triangular shape. I also noted that there was a slight bluish gray outline of the leading edge, quite possibly from the city lights. I noted no engine noise, nor could I see any other remarkable traits of the object.  It moved in a straight line towards town.  I then ran to the SSW side of my home to see if I could get a better view of the object from the glow of the city lights.  I could no longer see the object.

3 chamber, triangle shaped object;2010-08-31 08:20:00;a minute or so;3 chamber, triangle shaped object while driving home the other evening I saw a 'UFO' and the guy content with driving 10 miles per hour behind me on a 60 mile per hour road, also saw it.  It looked like a plane at first, it had one pale blue light and one red light- one of 2 of its chambers.  It was not moving at, more hovering before moving every so slowly south.  It was silver, not shiny, and it had 3 circular compartments connected by metal bars, in the shape of a triangle.  There wasnt any sound that i could tell. I mention this becaseu it was out in the courty and often times we can hear planes even when we cant see them.  For a second before it began moving, I thought I saw a very light greenish glow casting downwads, but it could have been my mind playing tricks on me.;30.7026013245033;-96.3553635761589
Bright white tube mega ship hovering, later similar turns into triangle saucer.;2014-10-06 15:20:00;15 minutes;Bright white tube mega ship hovering, later similar turns into triangle saucer. Traveling east down Villa Maria crossed the hwy 6 over pass notice a bright white tube shaped object larger than anything I have ever seen in the sky hovering, not moving whatsoever above the Brazos Center. I pulled into Brazos center parking lot and the craft slowly moves out of sight heading east. I continue onto 1179 as I approach Grassburr road I see what appears to be the same object in the sky hovering above the left hand side of Grassburr Rd. I pull off on grassburr and stop my truck and get out. Im standing there and the craft is moving towards me silently its incredibly bright white light I was unable to stare at it without my sunglasses on. It appeared to be 200 feet or so up in the air and about 500 feet in front of me when the edge of the craft closest to me dips down revealing it true shape, best way I can describe it is imagine a triangle and at the points are also the center point of circles and these three circles overlap forming one mass. As the edge of the craft dipped I saw the top of it and it was more of a gray color but the color was not solid it looked like the three circle areas that form the craft were energizing in some way. The size of the craft was about 300 feet or so from one side to the next much much smaller than the one  that was hovering over the brazos center. The craft hovered at this angle “looking at me” for maybe 4 seconds then it leveled back out forming the shape of tube and turned back to bright white and crossed over to the right side of grassburr road and hovered above the pasture at a height of about 700 ft. I was super excited by what I was seeing and wanted it to come back closer so I turned on my lights and flashed them and the craft ended up moving up and away heading south west towards south College Station. I waited till I could no longer see the white light about 10 seconds.  As I was preparing to turn around something caught my eye again!  It was another tube like craft that was bright white traveling from east to west chasing after the craft that had just left, it appeared to be smaller than the one I saw over the Brazos center but its hard to say, also the one above the brazos center was massive and I dont think it was the same one that “looked at me” me on grassburr Rd. So I head on down 1179 and when I turned left at the “T” intersection something else caught my eye a smaller helicopter black in appearance flying in the same direction as the two previous crafts went.
