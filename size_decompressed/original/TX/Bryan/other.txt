And when I try something deep inside tells me not to!!! sorry..... Well first of all I've never told anyone this before! I'm 37 yrs old now an this happened when I was 17,It changed me! Got me thinking of alot of things I was a tough kid in those days I thought. that night I'll never forget!!! Well, the experience started the day before. My mom made me get a hair cut,an you could'nt wear a cap at school! So I skipped I spend most of the day in the nature trail that was part of our school. So, I looked for a place to crash til school was over.When I woke up I did'nt have a watch,an I did'nt hear the bell ring! So I was'nt going home! I went to my grandmothers house. visited with her, an ate ! It was getting late! my grandmother reminded me that I had to go home. So about an hour later I left. The only thing on my mind on the way home, was I wonder if she knows I skipped! Well, I got to point where I decided to take a short-cut threw the nature trail The next 15-20 mins I will never forget!!! I started walking there were dogs barking at me from homes near the trail, I could see the path alittle from the moon light.It was kinda cool or I was just scared! i had picked up two pretty big rocks & was carring them with me, in case there was something or someone in the woods. I was getting close to the entrance so I started to hurry alittle, then right there in front of me was something that i could'nt even describe I thought it was a joke at first but it started to move an it did'nt move right i mean who the hell would look like that & move like that in the woods! I raised arm Like I was gonna throw the rock! & I've never seen anybody move that fast, I started to scream things like I'm gonna kill your (F)ing ass!!!! an ran right for the entrance or exit! I ran about 15-20 feet & turned to throw the rock, An I saw A big bright light that shot straight up in the air!!! I ran til I got home, When I got there I just got in trouble for coming home kinda late! I know my life then to you probably seems weirder. i did tell a friend of mind but he did'nt believe at all. well, th! ats my e xperience with what I call now my close encounter. I know what I saw! an i wish & pray that I did'nt because I cant get it out of my mind! and I am really scared inside!!!!!  thank you...............â€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Strange lights in the sky, multiple crafts.;2011-11-04 02:05:00;3 seconds;Strange lights in the sky, multiple crafts. At about 2:00 AM on Friday morning November 4 2011 I went outside for a cigarette and was looking up at the stars as I always do.  The sky was clear and the stars were out.   I saw 3 lights in a triangular shape move quickly across the sky from SSE to NNW.  The lights were dim and there was no noise.   The lights were solid and not blinking, they were white in color and just before it went out of view they switched positions.   They could have been 1 craft rotating or 3 different craft switching positions.  But the impression I got was that it was one craft with 3 lights.  I watched the skys for a bit longer then went inside to text about it. I then went back outside about 15 minutes later and at about 2:20 am saw about 7-8 dim white lights in a line, each light slightly staggered from the previous one.  This object moved as one object, it was likely a cigar shaped craft and it moved from North to South.  It appeared to be higher in the sky than the first one I saw. I am a graduate student at Texas A&M and live in Bryan just over the College Station border.;30.7026013245033;-96.3553635761589
