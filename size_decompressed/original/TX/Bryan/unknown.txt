Suddenly he heard a loud, high-pitched sound overhead, looked up and saw a clear but well-defined movement of air, circular, approximately 18 inches-24 inches in diameter.  It was darting rapidly from place to place among the tree branches, causing the branches and leaves to blow.  It was about the height of the roof of our two-story house.  After about a minute to and minute and a half it darted up and left.  The trees blocked his view of the actual direction it went. The other witness was our son who was talking on the cell phone to my husband.  He asked his dad, What’s that noise?  Did your alarm just go off?   It was so loud that it could be heard clearly at the other end of the phone. We did an internet search to see if it could have been a weather phenomenon but have not come up with anything yet.;30.7026013245033;-96.3553635761589
Fast moving low level bright light in my backyard.;2014-07-03 04:45:00;3 minutes;Fast moving low level bright light in my backyard, On July 3, 2014 at about 4:45 am, I let my dog out in the backyard and about 3 minutes later he started barking as if there was an intruder.   I waited for an estimated 2.5 minutes after the barking started before I opened the door to see a very bright white light that was possibly 2-4 feet in dimensions but could not ascertain whether if was circular, rectangular, or some other geometric shape because of its movement speed.   This object could have been elongated (longer than wide giving off a trailing light impression).  Because of its brightness, it was lighting about ¼ of our large back yard.  Upon my seeing the UFO, it continued to move very fast in random directions around the backyard at a estimated height of 5 to 6 feet.    While I viewed the UFO, it appeared to stay about the same height above the ground as it darted about while staying in the backyard area.  It took me about 15 seconds to realize what I was seeing after I opened the door to see my dog! barking and jumping at the fast moving UFO which was a single light source. I then called my dog’s name and he ran through the open door back into the house and I closed the door.  I then turned off one of the patio lights (leaving another on) by quickly walking to the patio light switch (possibly 20 ft. away) and then immediately looked through our backyard glass French door and the UFO was no longer visible.  So, although I viewed the moving UFO for about possibly 30 seconds, I believe the UFO was in the backyard for about 3 minutes, because of the estimated duration of my dog barking.;30.7026013245033;-96.3553635761589
Three lights in a vertical row.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-27 20:00:00;4;Three lights in a vertical row. Began as three thin lines of light in a vertical line.  After a minute one disappeared and the remaining two stayed in position, a minute later a second seemed to flash in and out and eventually disappeared as well.  The final light stayed a few minutes afterwards until finally disappearing.  Objects looked like they were refracting light in the same way a prism would.
