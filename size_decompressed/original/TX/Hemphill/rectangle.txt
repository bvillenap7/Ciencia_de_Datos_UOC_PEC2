These are real.;2008-01-04 10:00:00;10 - 15 sec.;These are real. I was fishing the banks of Toledo Bend Reservoir that morning.  After the sound of two military aircraft traveling at high speed had passed I heard something overhead moving at high speed through the air. There was an unusual pulsing sound along with a soft hum. I looked up and saw a craft much like one of those shown in todays Discovery channel broadcast on UFO's in Illinois. This sighting was in broad daylight. There were no flashing lights. The object stopped about 1,000 ft. overhead. As best as I can determine, it left heading in a SSW direction at a remarkably high speed. I reported this to the local Sabine County Reporter. There was no follow up. 3 or four days later I saw reports of other Texas sightings on Headline news. This is the second sighting in my life.
