Unknown craft observed hovering near nuclear power plant;2002-06-02 04:00:00;1 1/2 hours;Unknown craft observed hovering near nuclear power plant My wife, daughter and I were staying at a bed and breakfast in Glen Rose, TX.  Our room was on the 2nd floor and had a balcony.  My wife couldn't sleep and went out on the balcony at approximately 4AM.  She woke me up saying she was observing a UFO.  I went out and observed the object.  Circular, stationary in the sky, estimated altitude 1000 - 2000 feet, approximately 5 miles away.  There were alternating red and green blinking lights coming from the object.  There was no sound.  Every couple of minutes it appeared to emit a ring of white vapor.  My wife also woke my daughter,  The three of us watched the object until it could no longer be seen in the morning light.  The next morning I realized that from where I had seen the object, it would have been near a nuclear power plant located near Glen Rose. ((NUFORC Note:  Based on the description provided, we believe that a twinkling star is the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.  PD));32.2277;-97.7656999999999

Strange bright orb that looks like a second sun in the sky, but lower than the sun.;2013-08-21 13:00:00;~5 minutes;Strange bright orb that looks like a second sun in the sky, but lower than the sun. My husband and I were heading back to Arlington from Glen Rose on Hwy. 67, on August 21, 2013 around 13:00 or a little later. The clouds were really unique looking, so I lowered my seat back and got my camera phone and decided to take some pictures of the clouds.  I just took the pictures in different time increments.  Usually when I thought the clouds were unique.  I took 10 pictures and thought I would look at them when I got home and downloaded them on my laptop. But I forgot about them until August 26th, 2013.. What I saw in my pictures is the sun high in the sky and a smaller bright orb below it, with clouds all around.  Every picture is different, and this orb goes behind some trees and sometimes in the distance and then again close up. I Showed the pictures to several people who could not figure it out.  One person pointed out that if it was a glare or something like that, the orb would stay in one position.  But the orb was in several different positions.  Not sure what we saw but would like to know.;32.2277;-97.7656999999999
