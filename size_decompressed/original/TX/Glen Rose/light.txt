Orange orbs west of Glen Rose;2010-03-31 20:00:00;10 minutes;Orange orbs west of Glen Rose Heading west on hwy 67, in Glen Rose, I saw 2 lights west of town.  The sun had set but the sky was still light.  They would turn on, then off.  The one on the left (south) would glow orange, then the other one on the right would turn on, so to speak, and glow orange.  They would dim to red and then both would turn off.  This occurred 3 times with a duration of maybe 5-10 seconds.  Both lights appeared stationary.  I got to the top of chalk mountain and pulled over at the picnic area where I got out and looked for 5 minutes and never saw them.;32.2277;-97.7656999999999
