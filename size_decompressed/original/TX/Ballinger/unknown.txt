Loud Roar, Bright Orange Lights;2007-10-01 21:00:00;5 minutes;Loud Roar, Bright Orange Lights I live in the country so no city lights..clear night, lots  of stars..I hear this loud roar like a very low but very slow jet..So I go outside. Keep hearing the roar for the longest time..maybe 4 minutes and I finally hear it moving towards the east north east..then when I can barely hear it any longer,(maybe 5 minutes from start to finish) I am looking towards the eastern sky and I see a huge orange light come one for maybe 5 seconds and go off up in the sky..then to the south I see another orange light come on for a few seconds and it's over.;31.746;-99.9613
