We all stood up silently as this huge craft flew right over us. It came from the southeast and almost seemed to have a headlight.As it got close we all rose to watch it.It seemed to fill the sky.  It was moving very slow maybe 10 miles an hour.it was 100' off the ground.  Shaped like a boomarang.  Corners had small dim lights and even the headlight was dim up close.  It was very dark.  Without the lights we would not have even seen it.  It turned left and went up Hwy 67 south, going towards San Angelo.  We did not report it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
