I was leaning against the car and I think he was standing when all of a sudden in the not too far distance we saw an astonishing bright white light that kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.   we never saw the craft.   the wild dogs in the area were howling at it.    I was really just so amazed and my friend was feeling more protective and cautious and excited about it, so he said he thought we ought to get in the car.   We got in the car and he took out his rifle.   I said what are you going to do, shoot at a spacecraft???   he answered:   yes if I have to! ........ It was very odd ...... we didnt see the spacecraft but we HEARD it CLEARLY ..... the mechanical noise whirring past us ....... it was really a different kind of experience.  We were amazed and then curiosity got the best of us and we decided to follow it or go look for it.   We drove a little way down a country road and then decided we were IDIOTS .... for what would we do if we FOUND it?   We got scared and returned to his office where he worked.  It was rather a peculiar thing.   It was definitely a mechanical sound but unlike a plane sound, unlike a helicopter sound, unlike anything I'd ever heard before.   I wonder what it was.
