I noticed a bright light coming from the South / West part of the sky.;2004-04-18 21:00:00;5 minutes;While my wife and I were traveling home from a trip to San Francisco on the evening of April 18th, we were driving through a remote stretch of the mountains between Highway 33 and Interstate 5 near Gorman / Frazier Park, Ca. I noticed a bright light coming from the South / West part of the sky. It was much brighter than anything else in the sky at that time. I thought maybe it was one of the comets I have been hearing about in the news lately so I pulled over to observe it through my binoculars. The best detail I could give was an incredibly bright light, situated at about 45 degrees on the horizon. It was totally dark with no moon that I can recall. My wife snapped several pictures of the object with our digital camera and then the light disappeared after about 5 minutes. We resumed our driving and noticed again, the light in the sky but thought nothing else about it until last night when my wife down loaded the pictures onto our computer. Upon further examination of the photos, enlarged to a dpi of 2000, the images became clear that they were not made by a planet, comet or aircraft that I am aware of. There was no sound but the object seemed to hang in the sky prior to vanishing. Once we resumed our trip, the object seemed to move away from us.;34.8229;-119.0342
