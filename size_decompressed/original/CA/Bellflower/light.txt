dramatic movements by red object in sky captured on video;2001-12-24 20:30:00;8 min;dramatic movements by red object in sky captured on video As my girlfriend and I were returning from delivering gifts to friends this afternoon, my girlfriend noticed an unusual light in the sky. She pointed it out to me and I thought at first that it was an airplane. What I saw was a red light that seemed to pulse, however, after watching it for a few moments I asked my girlfriend to go and get the video camera from inside the house. The light moved around in a small area of the sky above and to the south of our home. It was at times very bright and moved in many different directions. It took a moment but I managed to get the camera focused in on it. At that moment my girlfriend ran and got the neighbors to show them what we were seeing. They too thought the light was very unusual. The most exciting thing happend whem I watched the tape I had made which was zoomed in to the object 16x. The object was close to another object or what may have been a star that can be used as a reference point. The larger red object seemed to move very quickly and stop very ubruptly and them move away some of this effect can possibly be atributed to the zooming of the lens but some of the movement is so obvious that I can't even beleive what I am seeing. Perhaps someone can direct me to a person or institution that can assit me in either explaining this or ? The video is approxamately 5 min. long on vhs C;33.8838000000005;-118.126099999997

I looked to see what they were staring at and saw this red light floating.  The light moved unlike anything Ive ever seen before, but some what like this one magnetic toy I had as a kid hoovering on the magnetic field.  The light swayed back and forth slowly while ascending into the sky from the South West towards the West untill it reached the thick cloud line and faded away and disappeared.  It lasted somewhere between five to ten minutes.  Where's a telescope when you need one.;33.8838000000005;-118.126099999997
