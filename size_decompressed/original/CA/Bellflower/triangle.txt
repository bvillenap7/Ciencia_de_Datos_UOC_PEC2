Triangular shaped object hovering above a house in Bellflower CA.;2012-02-05 00:22:00;1 min;Triangular shaped object hovering above a house in Bellflower CA. Driving home at around 12:22am, I saw a triangular shaped object (more arrow head shaped) in the sky hovering about 50 to 75 feet above a house about doors down from my house.  It had a red light on one side and a white light on the other with a flashing red light.  Because of the flashing red light I thought it was a helicopter at first.  The shape and size (smaller then any helicopter I've ever seen) is what drew my attention.  It took off faster and smother then a helicopter would.  I thought maybe it was a remote control hover craft because of it's size.  I wish I hadn't been driving so I could hear if it was making noise.  As low as it was you would think I could hear it even in the car if it was a helicopter.  The flashing light makes me think it was something man made, but it was small and triangular shaped.  It didn't look like anything I'd ever seen before.;33.8838000000005;-118.126099999997
