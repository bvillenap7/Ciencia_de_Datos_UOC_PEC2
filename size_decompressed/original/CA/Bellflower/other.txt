At first sight object dropped what seemed to be a flair. Two small red lights seen crossing the horizon from west to east. The two lights blinked very slowly.

The two red lights seemed to be on a wing shaped object too dark to tell. when the object slowly moved to the east it started to dissapear and slowly dimmed but also started to blink more rapidly ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is anonymous.
