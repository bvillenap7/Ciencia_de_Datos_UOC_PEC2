Red blob, went to a dot, then disappeared;1999-11-20 23:45:00;2 minutes;Red blob, went to a dot, then disappeared I saw a red blob to the right and below venus as viewed from SE Los Angeles county.  It had no distinctive shape.  It changed to a dot after about a minute and a half, then disappeared about 15 seconds later. Is there a posibility that it was just a rocket going out of the atmosphere?;33.8838000000005;-118.126099999997
n amber colored star. It moved under a lot of clouds often seeming to stop cmpletely or to 'bob' up and down. Thank You.;1999-12-31 23:59:00;16 minutes;n amber colored star. It moved under a lot of clouds often seeming to stop cmpletely or to 'bob' up and down. Thank You. It was New Years Eve 1999. My sister and her husband were lighting firecrackers outside.  this was nearing 1200 a.m. My sister came to my door to sayyou have to see this I went outside not knowing what to expect and what I saw was a beautiful Amber colored light.  It was a very sweet, deep color and it looked like a star, except that it was moving,not datring across the sky like a shooting star.  This  star  had a very deliberate motion.  It move continuously west to east,but not always in a astraight line.  It would periodically bob up and down.  This caught my attention immediately because I know of no plane that could manage these manuevers.  Eventually it disappeared into the clouds.;33.8838000000005;-118.126099999997
