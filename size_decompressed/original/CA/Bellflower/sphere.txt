Several orange spheres seen in Lakewood and bellflower.;2012-11-10 19:00:00;10 minutes;Several orange spheres seen in Lakewood and bellflower. I was walking on south st going north and looked up and saw a bright orange shpere and then I saw three more of them flying in a triangle shape, the one at the bottom seemed to go a bit faster then the other two and was going up and down almost out of formation.  Then I saw four flying in a triangle shape with the fourth one in the middle again they seemed to speed up and slow down flying up and down out of formation.  Then I saw ones fling solo one after another a couple of them seemed to disappear and reappear then it was over.  There was a car pulled over with another witness I thought I was the only one.  I told my girlfriend about it. I hope she doesn't think I'm crazy, my phone was dead I wanted to try and capture it on video.  One thing I noticed about the last one I saw I was on Clark heading toward artesia was it seemed lower and looked like a fire as if it was a flying fire place yet it moved like it was under intelligence.
