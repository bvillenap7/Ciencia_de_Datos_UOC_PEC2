It was around 9 pm when this happened. I was outside waiting for a friend to come out and I saw a teardrop like craft.  There was all sorts of lights flashing on it.  It just came out of nowhere as if it was comming out of some sort of light speed and dissapeared in a matter of 1 second. I was kind of shocked and startled because i have never seen such a sight.;34.0718;-117.6973
