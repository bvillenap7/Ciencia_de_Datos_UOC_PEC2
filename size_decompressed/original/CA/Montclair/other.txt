Creepy reddish orange floating eye,(light)!;2014-12-07 12:00:00;5 minutes;Creepy reddish orange floating eye,(light)! I stepped out to have a smoke, and while smoking i was looking at the sky, and just looking around.  Anyway to the north there are mountains and hills, and on the hills are relay stations for t.v. etc..  One of the stations has a large antenna with a red pulsing light on its tip. while looking at the antenna light, i noticed another reddish light, out the corner of my eye to the right of where the antenna is,  It more or less dropped straight down from the sky, then in a long arcing line was heading in my direction, with a large orange slow pulsing light and a red hue around it.   Well i knew right then that this was very strange, dropped my cig and ran in the trailer to grab my new ipad for a picture.  Came outside and now this object was getting very close, so I starting firing off pictures.  Now this thing is almost over head and begins to slow way down and slowly turn to the west or left, and also at the point it slowed down the light stopped pulsing and staye! d on constantly.  Not being familiar with how the ipad camera works, i was fumbling about with it, and at the same time trying to keep my eyes on the object, that was more or less right above me now.  As it was in its turn the light, (without any other explanation for it) looked like an eye rolling back in its head and was gone!;34.0718;-117.6973
