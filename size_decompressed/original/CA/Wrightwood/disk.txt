It did that for about 30 seconds then it started to move up in the sky.  A minute later it the same thing happened.  It sat there for another mintue or so then it started to move toward us and further up into the sky my fater and I walked out the front door and walked around the house to see it dropping more stuff this time it dropped at least ten then it started to fly further out of our site and all of a suden it disappeared.  I started to go through my pictures at first it just looked like a red dot but the further i zoomed in the btter the picture looked it looked like a saucer you could tell because the glare thay was coming off it made a shadow so you could see it perfectly. I h! ave never believed in ufo's before but tonight chamged my mind for the rest of my life.;34.3628;-117.6249
