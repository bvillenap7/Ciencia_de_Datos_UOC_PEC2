3 Red lights;2011-09-16 21:15:00;15 minutes;3 Red lights It was about 9:15 pm and I was walking home from our local high school football game with my 2 sons when I noticed a red fireball about 30,000 ft elevation that seemed to drop a white glowing ball. Within a minute it dropped two more red glowing balls, each one dropped at least one white ball each. I immediately called my wife and daughter who were at home. They ran outside and saw 3 red balls in the sky, in a v shape formation. 1 of the balls seemed to flare up and another red ball dropped from it.  My wife and sons state they heard a loud popping noise.  The ball that dropped seemed to fade away and then the same thing happened again.  The remaining 2 balls moved north and then vanished.
