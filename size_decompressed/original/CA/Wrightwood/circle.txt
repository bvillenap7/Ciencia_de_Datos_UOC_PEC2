Lights in the sky at summer camo;1998-06-20 23:00:00;5 minutes;Lights in the sky at summer camo So this was a while ago, I was at a summer camp in Wrightwood California and I was sleeping outside and were looking at the stars because thet sky is really clear in that  area. so I'm looking up and all off a sudden I see this round object flying in the sky, it was to far away to tell any specific features of the craft but I  knew that it had to be a UFO because of its flight path It went from side to side going across large distances in a short amount of time, like from one sided of the canyon to the other. It flew back and forth for a few minutes, then it flew straight up into the air maybe like 90 feet higher than it was originaly, then there was a bright white light around it and I didn't see it again after that,;34.3628;-117.6249
