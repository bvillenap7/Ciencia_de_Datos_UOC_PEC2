One family member playing video games in front living room. He was sitting in front of a window that faces South East. The craft was singular in shape. When he notified the rest of the family my first son and second son watched the craft split into two separate crafts. One was cigar shaped the other was circular. The cigar shaped craft took off at blinding speed from a near stop still to the South East. The Circular craft continued what looked like in excess of 200 mph to the North East. I did have a HD camera but when I was attempting to focus on the craft no more than a quarter to a half mile away I must have hit the stop recording button.  I had this craft focused perfectly in my view finder and had I not been so stupid or excited you would have had a smoking gun for certain.  The object that was cigar shaped was at least a 100 feet long, shiny metallic with a bright white light that flashed very slowly from dim to bright.  But most of the time this was visi! ble we did not really catch too much on how much it was pulsating because it was more of a blur as it took off to the South East.  Both objects were around 500 feet to perhaps nearly a thousand feet in the air.  The other circular craft was about 50 feet in diameter that pulsated White but I was able in the camera to see it flash color from pinks to orange to red to very bright white.  The cigar shaped craft was visible for ten seconds or less but the circular object was visible for about four minutes.;39.0682;-120.7224
