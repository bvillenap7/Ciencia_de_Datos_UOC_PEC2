See below.). ((NUFORC Note:  Time may be flawed.  We have attempted to contact the source to confirm whether the sighting occurred in the morning, or evening.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It is night time here so PM, and i estimate it half the size of the moon.  Also it was all white and it looked to be some kind of fire behind it glowing like.  I also need to correct the direction.  It was traveling east to west.  I apologize.  I was somewhat rattled.  It had just happened, when I reported it to you.  Thank you.
