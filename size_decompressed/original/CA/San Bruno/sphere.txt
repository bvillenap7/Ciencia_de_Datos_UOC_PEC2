It  was very very black;2003-12-30 10:40:00;4 - 6 min;It  was very very black 10:40am. I have just seen very black ball, glided under clouds, from San Francisco airport direction toward to north-west of San Bruno. The object was lost from my range of sight over the trees.First time this object attracted my attention, then I was in diningroom of my house, then, to proove my suspicion I step on balcony for better view. The distance and size of object was approximatly half of the aircraft(Boeing)-then it taking off and one mile away from ranway. Looks like, but am not sure for 100% there was an aura around the object. The speed of the ball was hard to tell exactly, but much slow then a small private plane. It was very very black, no shining or reflection. Someone else should saw the object, becouse it floated near by SFO.;37.6261;-122.4304
