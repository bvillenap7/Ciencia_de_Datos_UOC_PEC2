Bell shape object w/white light took off faster than we could believe driving home on 280nb;1992-04-01 21:30:00;2 - 3 minutes;Bell shape object w/white light took off faster than we could believe driving home on 280nb Bell shape object hanging in sky, motionless lit w/white light.  My husband and I were driving home on 280nb and having a conversation when I asked him what that was in the sky.  He said he didn't know and was just about to ask me the same thing.  Right then the thing took off to the right (east) faster than we could believe.  No airplane can go that fast.  (another sighting I previously listed here already on June 21, 1998 re the disk, diamond-shape and rocket w/red light - I have a picture to accompany this sighting that I found someone had taken by accident and posted on web 6 months after.)

Four flying objects that at times were stationary and also moved at tremendous speed;2001-09-19 14:30:00;1hr45min;Four flying objects that at times were stationary and also moved at tremendous speed I just happened to look up in the sky and noticed four flying objects at approximately 35 to 40 thousand feet altitude.  At first they were all in one row, then they went to a box formation and then to a triangle.   They reverted back and forth between the box and triangle.  When in the triangle formation, the fourth object was off to the right of the triangle.Then the fourth came from the west to the east at a tremendous speed without sound and disappeared out of sight. Now there were three left. About five min later one more flew by in the same manner.  When we looked back to the triangle, one was at 12:00 and the other was at 6:00 and at this time the third one also went from the east to the west at a speed I did not know existed. It stopped and went north the other two just stayed in the same place except they slowly gained altitude till they were out of sight. It appeared that the objects were yellow/orange in color though that may have been a reflection of the sun. They were too far away to determine any shape.  I am a devotee of aircraft historic and modern.  One of the persons with me is a pilot and could not understand what was happening. Another was a schoolteacher, and two are neighbors.  I called SFO airport,the FAA and channel 7 news. No one knew anything. This is the first time that I have seen anything like that. I am happy that there were other people there so I knew it was not a figment of imagination.;37.6261;-122.4304
