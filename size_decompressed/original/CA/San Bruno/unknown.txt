((HOAX??))  thin rocket shaped, flying apparition,smoke cloud colored,fast ,no lights was i could tell it wasnt a meteor;2006-07-23 04:00:00;seconds;thin rocket shaped, flying apparition,smoke cloud colored,fast ,no lights was i could tell it wasnt a meteor i saw it from san bruno, but it was in space, i was starring at the sky because a few days earlier i had seen a strange orange light flying then dissappear for a second time,it looks like an orange star but moves slowly,then gone, i figured it to be a satellite. i had also seen what looked to be          stars or meteorites, but  you can see a distinct tracer trail and what looked to be a trail of smoke behind it, but i figured it to be a meteor burning up when it hits the atmosphere, but i saw 3 in one night, so that seemed strange, so i was looking last night, and something zoomed across space, it was going so fast it was hard to see the shape, but it was aerodynamiaclly thin, it was translucent in color like a cloud or smoke. it was really high up in space and going really fast, like as if it was going light speed, but i could tell it was a craft because it had no lights, and the trajectory it was flying was a straight line, like parallel to earth like a military fly by. it almost look like a white bird or rocket, it was fast like it traveled  a couple hundred thousand miles in the matter a seconds, but it was really hard for me to tell the scale because it was so high, it was flying south to north.it was definately not in our atmoshere though, then moments later i thought i saw it again flying in a different direction, this time est to west, then after that i saw the orange light again in space, move in one direction kind of slowly, then it dissappeared ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
