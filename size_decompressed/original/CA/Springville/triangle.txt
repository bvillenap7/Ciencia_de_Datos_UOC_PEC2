triangular and transparent flying craft seen saturday night;2004-06-05 22:50:00;10 min.;triangular and transparent flying craft seen saturday night I saw it first. those 3 lights. They all moved in unison. if the front one slightly changed in direction so did all 3. kind of if all 3 were attached to a solid object, they always moved together  and in the same direction and they never changed distance between the lights. This flying thing went west and then turned south-west. The craft was also transparent except for the 3 lights. when it moved you could see the stars as it passed under them. when the craft was south west of us, the thing turned slightly and you could faintly see the sides of it. but you could still see through the middle. then the rear left light turned red and then the craft disappeared. This thing was big .  about 200 yards long on the sides and the rear was about 150 yards wide;36.139;-118.7934
