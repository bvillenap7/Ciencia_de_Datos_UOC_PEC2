A Formation of Small, Bright Spheres.;2016-05-21 18:15:00;15-20 minutes;A Formation of Small, Bright Spheres There was a group of about half a dozen small, bright white orbs high above.  One seemed a little closer and brighter than the others.  They seemed to be either stationary or moving very slowly.  The orbs were visible for about 15 to 20 minutes before disappearing completely.  I attempted to take a picture with a cell phone, but there was nothing clearly visible in the image.  Using my 35 mm film camera, I took several pictures but I will have to wait until I get them developed.;34.1091;-117.7126
