At approximately 5:35 p.m. on Thursday, April 22, 2010, myself and a co-worker witnessed an unusual constellation of bright, shiny objects darting about in the sky.  I was situated in the center of the city of Claremont, CA 91711, looking up at the eastern sky.  My angle of elevation was at approximately 75 degrees.  The cluster, of about a dozen or so objects, was loosely arranged in a random configuration, about the size of the sun.  The size of the individual objects was a bit larger than a star.  Their movement was of a random darting about sometimes appearing to suddenly disappear and then reappear.  I observed the phenomenon for about 2-3 minutes, before it abruptly stopped and disappeared altogether.;34.1091;-117.7126

A motor can be heard and it hovered for over 30 minutes then headed south, east towards Pomona, CA, at about 9:28 pm.   It looks and sounds to big to be a drone.  If it is a police helicopter the search light was not on.   It just went east at 9:30 pm towards Montclair, Ca.;34.1091;-117.7126
