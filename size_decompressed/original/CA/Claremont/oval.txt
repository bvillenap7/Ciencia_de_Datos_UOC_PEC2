odd dim oval shaped light near Mount Baldy in southern California.;2006-09-10 21:00:00;10 minutes;odd dim oval shaped light near Mount Baldy in southern California. I am a 20 year old student at the Claremont University Consortium.  I am an ardent skeptic and always maintain that there are rational explanations for UFOs and other strange phenomena.   It was later evening and I was walking back from the Claremont village area with a friend.  I'm interested in commercial aviation and my eyes followed the lights of an airliner passing overhead flying in a north-east direction, which is a normal flight path for departing aircraft out of LAX over this area.   As I watched the lights recede, I saw a strange oval-like shape that was only a little brighter than the night sky.  At first I thought it was the light of a star that was difficult to see because of streetlights in the area.  However, when we moved out from under street lights, there didn't appear to be any star, just an oval shaped very-dim light but with very clear definitions.   The light had no lights on it, and it seemed to drift in a straight line toward the southeast.  It didn't appear to be moving across the sky very fast.  The light was north-west of my position toward the Mount Baldy.   I saw the light for about 10 minutes before eventually looking away because I was so startled by this thing I couldn't explain.  I assumed it might be a balloon, but it didn't appear to move or look like a balloon.   When I looked back up in the sky about 10 minutes later, I didn't see any traces of the object.;34.1091;-117.7126
