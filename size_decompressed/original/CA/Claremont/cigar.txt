Around sunset two of us observed two very distant unidentified flying objects to our north, about 65 or 70 degrees above the northern horizon. They were cigar-shaped to the naked eye but with binoculars could be seen to have three sections. They were white, as seen in reflected sunlight. They were a little smaller than a high-altitude jet. They drifted very slowly to the east, or perhaps at times were stationary or moving in other directions. At one point in our observation of them, what looked like a white dot to the naked eye but appeared to be a plane with wings as viewed with binoculars approached one of the objects and flew in its vicinity for serveral minutes before disappearing from view. Finally the objects themselves became fainter and disappeared from view. 	The two of us are very involved with ufology. We have each, independently, had two previous UFO sightings. One of us is a contactee and has had telepathic contact with ETs. Neither of us felt any telepathic contact with the UFOs of the present sighting.
