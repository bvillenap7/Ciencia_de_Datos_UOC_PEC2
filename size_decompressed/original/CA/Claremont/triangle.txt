TRIANGULAR AIRCRAFT EERILY SILENT AND SLOW-MOVING;2020-04-26 23:30:00;15-45 seconds;TRIANGULAR AIRCRAFT EERILY SILENT AND SLOW-MOVING RESIDENTIAL SUBURBAN AREA. SITTING ON BALCONY AT 11:30PM. IT WAS A HOT DAY SO  ME AND PARTNER ENJOYING A CHAT IN THE COOL OF THE NIGHT. WE WERE STAR GAZING. I HAVE VERY GOOD EYE SIGHT AND SUDDENLY SAW A TRIANGULAR SHAPED AIRCRAFT IN THE DISTANCE TO THE WEST FLYING EAST TOWARD US. THE AIRCRAFT WAS GREYISH/WHITISH IN THE NIGHT SKY AND WAS SMOOTH AND SOLID. NO WINGS OR JAGGED EDGES VISIBLE. LOOKED LIKE A MANTA RAY.  VERY OVERWHELMING TO  SEE. IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING THAT WANTED TO BE SEEN. ALMOST INVISIBLE. NO EXHAUST TRAIL. IT WAS NOT MOVING FAST, SEEMED MUCH SLOWER THAN JET OR EVEN PROPELLER PLANE. WAS NOT FLYING HIGH. APPROX.500-700 FEET AWAY. NO LIGHTS AT FIRST UNTIL IT FLEW OVER US WE SAW THERE WERE LIGHTS IN A V-FORMATION. THEY WERE NOT SHINING OR FLICKERING, THEY ALMOST SEEMED LIKE REFLECTORS. COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING ELSE BENEATH THE CRAFT BESIDES THE V-FORMATION. WHAT FREAKED US OUT  WAS THAT IT WAS EERILY SILENT. NO SOUND AT ALL. FLEW PRETTY MUCH IN A STRAIGHT LINE THEN LOST SIGHT OF IT OVER OUR ROOF.;34.1091;-117.7126
Two Silent Triangular Shaped Aircraft.;2020-06-09 21:00:00;20 seconds;Two Silent Triangular Shaped Aircraft me and my partner witnessed two triangular shaped aircraft, one flying up front, the other a few seconds behind, yellow and red lights flashing, but something about the flashing/lights seemed odd, flying very fast, looked weird, not like a regular plane, flying low about 500 feet in the air, flying over residential area, headed West, we live in a very quiet neighborhood and we had just commented on how quiet it was, when we saw the aircraft, we waited for the sound to hit but neither of them made any sound. Both were completely silent.  We also witness one triangular shaped aircraft about two months ago. Pretty much the same description, greyish, only we saw it much later in the night. No lights except it had a V-formation of lights beneath (most probably reflectors). Also completely silent. SO DAMN FREAKY!  Not sure if this is related, but about 25 minutes before we saw these two aircraft, we  witnessed, two planes possibly escorting another plane. One plane up front, the other plane at the back and in the middle another plane. Could not make out is shape except that it was black or grey, with no lights. That's what made it so strange as well as three planes flying in a line. The regular planes had lights but no light at all from plane in the middle.  We left a report on this website but due to the backup of sightings, have yet to be contacted. Thank you for your time.;34.1091;-117.7126
