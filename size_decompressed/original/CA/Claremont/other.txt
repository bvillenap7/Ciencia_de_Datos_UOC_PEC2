Around mid night I noticed a strange light outside. At first I thought it was a star but it was flashing blue, red, green, and yellow lights. I know it was not an airplane because it sat completely still and did't move at all. I was able to get 2 pictures of it. I looked at the 2 pictures and got a closer look at what I saw. there were 3 balls of light. close together. After about 15 minutes it was gone. it seemed to move slowly away.;34.1091;-117.7126
