strange light above Glendale, CA;2008-06-07 23:30:00;5 min;strange light above Glendale, CA I was talking to my friend in his front yard and noticed a bright yellow light in the sky. It was bigger than the surrounding stars. First I thought it was a plane, but there where more planes in the sky, however this light didn't have a flashing light like the other planes. It was traveling at a very high speed and simple disappeared. Like someone had turned of the light. It wasn't a searching light.;34.1174552716953;-118.260974043746

A bolt of white light flashed from left to right along the street, just above vehicle level.;2018-01-23 12:15:00;2 seconds;A bolt of white light flashed from left to right along the street, just above vehicle level in a way that caught everyone's attention and could not be explained. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It was a football-sized ball of light with a tail, as best we could say, since it happened so quickly, and was so bright. I was in a beauty salon at the time and we all just looked at each other in disbelief, agreeing that we had indeed seen a UFO of some description.  The time was 12.15 pm,  yes, 15 minutes past noon.
