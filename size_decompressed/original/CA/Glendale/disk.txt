Noted classic saucer shaped object glowing a whitish green.  Object was clearly defined as to shape and not distorted by light intensity.  Ojbject appeared stationary.  Estimate evelation - 4-5 thousand ft.  Could not retain sight of object lor a longer period because of driving coniderations. UFO Center - I have followed Mr.Davenport on Art Bell's show for years, but never expected to be writing such a report. Notably, I only consulted the Center's website last evening because I thought what I had seen on 2-8-00 was some form of elaborate prank.  What was incredibly sobering for me, however, was 2-8 report from someone in North Hollywood California, of an object slowly moving east at 17:47. North Hollywood California is located approximately ten miles to the west of the location where my observation took place. Basically, it was dark and a storm was clearing.  There was a modest amount of broken cloud cover to the west.  I was heading north up the #2 freeway at approximately 65 mph.  This location placed me about seven or eight air miles north of downtown Los Angeles and almost directly to the east of North Hollywood. This time night traffic monitoring helicopters and other aircraft are not uncommon overhead, but I noted enough light from three or four sources (I think at least one or or two of the other sources were aircraft) to turn and look 90 degrees to my left.  Turning this far, I picked up a light source further to my left and then turned my head to near maximum.  Doing such, I was visually able to scan an object perhaps 35 degrees above the horizon and 110 degrees to the left and west of the direction I was driving. I only maintain this object in my vision for perhaps two seconds before safety required a return to the roadway.  I was unable to look again for another 30 seconds because of traffic considerations. However brief the observation time, the object observed was very clear. It was cleary disc or saucer-shaped.  The sharpness of its features were not diminished by clouds or weather. Dimensions are difficult to estimate, but my best estimate would be from 60 to 80 feet in diameter and perhaps 20 feet high in the middle.  The object glowed in a soft neon-type of manner and almost appeared transleuscent - - about the consistency of a jellyfish (!). Perhaps the best indicator of authenticity of my seeing this object was my immediate emotional reaction - laughter.  I could not believe this object to be any type of genuine UFO - - After all, it was so obviously a flying saucer and over a large urban area during commuter time, with sufficiently good enough visibility for it to be easily seen from both the ground and from the air.  I thought it to be a prank - an elaborate one, mind you - - cooked up by USC, UCLA or CAL TECH science students to measure societal reaction to such a blatantly obvious object.  The fact is there is a good part of me that still feels it to be a prank and that the joke's on me. Approximately 3/4 of a mile north of where I observed the object, the #2 FW begins a straight-graded climb into the San Rafael Hills.  When I reached this area I undid my safety belt and tried a couple of quick body turns in the seat.  I saw lights, but nothing distinct. In retrospect, that I didn't pull over as soon as possible after the initial sighting is pretty much explained by my laughter - that this object was clearly and distinctly there is a fact - - that this sighting was also defined as a joke or a prank by me at the time is also true. Concluding comment.  I am convinced that this object must have been seen by hundreds of people.  -Those driving south on the #2 FW and down the grade would have been afforded an exceptional view when this object was in the location it was when seen by me.  I made no special effort to monitor the local news for sighting or prank related information at the time.  I'm inclined now to go back and do some checking.  I admire the person who reported what was probably the same object - seen fifteen minutes earlier - in North Hollywood.  Had that report not been earlier made and published by the Center, I would not be making this report at this time. I would certainly appreciate any additional information the comes to the Center on this matter.;34.1174552716953;-118.260974043746
metallic saucer in broad daylight floating near verdugo mountains in glendale/los angeles area;2002-06-14 15:00:00;less than a minute;metallic saucer in broad daylight floating near verdugo mountains in glendale/los angeles area there was only one, and it sort of came out of nowhere. It was about ten, maybe twenty miles from where I was. I was in a car wash station with my wife and niece waiting for our car to come out then when I looked at the mountain view, I saw this flying thing, shining from the sun which appeared to look like a disc. I wasnt certain what the shape was, but it certainly was somewhat round as the sun's reflection had a gradient to it. It floated west as fast as a helicopter although I didnt see any propellers or wings or fins to identify it as a plane or chopper. It was certainly metallic, maybe silver and it later dissappeared into the canopy of trees and power lines and buildings as I was at a vantage point with many obstructions to my field of view. I pointed it out to my wife and she gasped and saw it, my niece also saw it and couldnt believe what it was.;34.1174552716953;-118.260974043746
UFO Sighting at Scholl Canyon, Glendale, CA;2012-09-15 18:40:00;3 minutes;UFO Sighting at Scholl Canyon, Glendale, CA I was up at Scholl Canyon in Gledale California with a friend of mine. Parked all the way at the top we were having some cigarettes and just talking about life. From the get go we noticed that there were many animals out even though it wasn't a full moon.  At about 6:20 we noticed someone in a motorcycle drive up. He looked very mysterious and went past the point of no entrance. Like 10 minutes later he came back down and my friend and I both thought it was very suspicious. At about 6:30u friend said he was hearing something,  I had no idea what he was talking about. After a couple of cigarettes we decides it was time to leave since it was getting dark. When we got in the car we noticed a huge object in the sky on top of the hill in the direction of where the person in the motorcycle had gone. I couldn't believe what I was lookig at.  It wasn't far at all and it looked like a saucer. There were windows around it and it had really bright lights. After about 3 mi! nute it dissappeared as if it somehow knew that we saw it ( maybe because I turned my car on). I proceeded to driving towards it where the guy in theotorcy me had gone and the skies were clear.  There is no way something that big could have disappeared do fast. Without a doubt it wasn't any craft like the ones I've seen before.;34.1174552716953;-118.260974043746

The silver disk moved from right  to left and stopped fror a moment and disappeared.;2017-08-07 13:17:00;2-4 seconds;The silver disk moved from right  to left and stopped fror a moment and disappeared. While driving for my doctors appointment in Glendale, California, I decided to exit on Harvey in Glendale and take the side streets.  As I was passing 1 or 2 blocks going east of Verdugo Blvd. on Wilson, I happened to look up on the right hand side of my windshield.  I was asking myself and wondering why the lightpost was very high up in the sky without the post.   Not a moment too soon, I saw a silver disk just hovering in front of my sight up in the sky.  It was like at a stand still.  I gasped and muttered Oh, my God! and for all I know, in the blink of an eye, the thing disappeared.  It was a UFO.   I glanced at my cellphone wanting to take a picture, but couln't because I was driving and the UFO was so fast in disappearing.  The time was 13:18. It was exciting to realize this was not the only instance I saw a UFO several years ago while driving on the Glendale freeway.  But it was a little far and this time it was bigger since it was more close.;34.1174552716953;-118.260974043746
