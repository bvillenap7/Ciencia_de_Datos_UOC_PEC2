Metallic cone shaped disc flying near 2 freeway in Glendale, CA;2010-06-21 11:45:00;15 seconds;Metallic cone shaped disc flying near 2 freeway in Glendale, CA I was driving south on the 2 freeway in Los Angeles, California, approximately about 1 mile before coming up to the Mountain St exit in Glendale.   At my 1 o’clock, on the horizon I noticed a very bright object in the sky.  I thought it was a plane banking and reflecting the sun light.  The object was moving towards me, heading north parallel to the west side of the freeway.  As it approached I could see that it looked like a sphere flying in the air, clearly not an airplane shape.  The object kept coming, as it got closer and the glare went away I was able to get a good view of it from the passenger’s front window. It was a metallic disc, with conical shape at the bottom and top, rhombus shaped profile.  It had no windows, lights or moving parts.  I was a metallic color, resembling what an unpainted aluminum aircraft body would look like and it had no markings on it.  It was moving in a straight line with no signs of leaving any trail behind it.  To the best of my a! bility I’d estimate the object was about the size of  a helicopter maybe bigger, flying some 350 meters off the ground at a speed similar to a plane.  The object flew with the edge of the disc pointing to the ground at a steep angle, the face of the disc pointing forward.  The closest it came to me was about 400-500 meters.  The whole sighting lasted about 15 seconds.;34.1174552716953;-118.260974043746
