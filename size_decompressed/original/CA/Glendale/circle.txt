Bright, Stoplight Red Craft;2000-07-25 21:20:00;5+ seconds;Bright, Stoplight Red Craft I was doing my nightly summertime satellite & star observing with binoculars on my backyard deck.  The deck faces north to Polaris exactly.  I had lowered my binoculars to say something to my teenage son and was putting them back up to my eyes looking slightly northeast when a bright, tomato red object caught my eye.  I immediately looked through the binoculars and saw the object.  It was round and was stop sign red.  It looked as though it was lit somehow, like neon and divided on the surface (bottom?) into 3 or 4 slightly brighter, whiter (hotter?) areas.  Like a pie graph divided into fourths, with the center of each slice being whiter.  It moved fairly quickly to the east/northeast and was then lost to my view behind the 2 1/2 story roof of the house to the rear.  The object looked to be about the size of the ISS through binoculars--I have no way to judge how large or small that actually is or how high it was.;34.1174552716953;-118.260974043746
Big green light fall out of the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor??  PD));2010-08-16 11:14:00;3 sec.;Big green light fall out of the sky We drove home through the canyon. Before we drove up to our home, a big green circle fireball fell from the sky.  It was to big for a flyer.  Because we live in a mountain area, it's hard to estimate how far or where it landed.

Starlike colorful, red, blue, green, purple UFO that emerged from the other side of the hill.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Capella?  PD));2012-10-19 23:58:00;>2 hours;Starlike colorful, red, blue, green, purple UFO that emerged from the other side of the hill Me and a friend were outside my home up in the hills near Glendale community college in Glendale, California, this has been happening all week starting on 10/13/12, when it gets dark and the stars come out, there is this bizzare starlike object, looks so different from all other stars in many ways: 1) its lower (closer to horizon) than all other stars, 2) its brighter and constantly changing colors randomly, red, green, blue, purple, 3) me and my friend were staring at it for a while, ten fifteen minutes straight and both came to the conclusion that it is not stationary, moving so slightly that u had to stare at it a while to notice the movement, goes left, stops, right, stops, towards us, stops, back, stops, all so slowly, always changing color. It basically moves but stays in the same general area, right where the star Sirius is supposed to be.  We pointed it out to a visitor arriving and he noticed movement as well. Just so bizzare, what is this please te! ll me? It has been eight nights in a row now. The most recent sighting was yesterday at 11:58PM we were looking at it to no avail when we finally see it emerge from behind the nearest hills visible from my balcony.  It moves slowly and to the right (we always see it when we are facing E/NE).  If u draw a line down towards the horizon starting from orions belt, its right along that line.  This had been going on all week, but last night, we saw it again, and this time, we saw it emerge from behind the hills, this eliminates any possibility that this starlike bright object is a planet or star.  I would go so far as to say that this object is in the Earth's atmosphere.  When we saw it last night, and recorded video, ended up moving from just above the mountain range far upwards and to the right, unlike any of the six previous (of seven) nights I stayed awake to spot it.  I suspect since it didn't stay in the same general area as it usually did, that it is leaving, and I will no! t see it again tonight.  I will try to keep everyone updated. ! We were suspicious at first, thinking this was the star Capella, or more likely the star Sirius, b/c it is in that same position every night, but seeing it come UP from BEHIND the hillside shows that it is not a star nor a planet/asteroid, anything from space.  It is within the Earth's atmosphere.  I have posted the recordings we have made on my youtube channel billdaburgereater, these are the links to the second and most recent sighting videos.  Though I cannot say for sure what it is, having seen it emerge from behind the hills, I can conclusively say what it is not.  The video does not capture the UFO emerging from behind the hill b/c when it did at 11:58PM, my roommate who has the camera was not home.  The second she got home, she set up the camera on a stand and I have included the following links to this description:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29452Yl4kU4&feature=channel&list=UL (second sighting, not using camera stand 10/17/12)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyb8lce5qn0&list=PLFE3F8777B0C557FD&index=8&feature=plpp_video (most recent sighting 10/19/12)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gabacCVbx1A&feature=bf_next&list=PLFE3F8777B0C557FD (better edited video w/commentary of the witnesses 10/19/12) ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Capella?
