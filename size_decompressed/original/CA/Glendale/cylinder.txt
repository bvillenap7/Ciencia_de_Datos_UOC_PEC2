Cluster of 20-30 round silver looking objects flying through sky in the early evening.;2014-09-04 17:38:00;15-20 minutes;Cluster of 20-30 round silver looking objects flying through sky in the early evening A cluster of approximately 20-30 round, silver looking objects that appeared to have halos moving north east through the sky in a consistent formation, moving slowly at an even speed until out of sight.   I tried to capture them on video but they were too distant to capture on my camera, but they looked exactly like the objects in this video I came across on youtube while searching the internet to see if anyone else had seen the same thing I had seen.  I am very curious as to what they might have been. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qVs0xx1PbQ;34.1174552716953;-118.260974043746
