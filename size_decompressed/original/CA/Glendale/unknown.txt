Pulsating glow behind cloud.;2003-03-03 19:10:00;5 mins;Pulsating glow behind cloud. I was walking to my car after work when I notice a pulsating white light behind a cloud to the west of me. It was impossible to be a projected light from the ground and too large to be from normal air traffic.  It pursated for about 90 seconds before I ran in to the office to inform a co-worker.  We went back to the spot I first witnessed the light, and it seemed to be gone. After several minutes of discusssing what I say, I caught it out of the corner of my eye.  It was the same light but it was sustained for at least 7-8 seconds, then dimmed down to nothing. It repeated agian several minutes later.  That was the last time it pursated. ((NUFORC Note:  The light could not have been either Jupiter or Sirius, since both of them would have been to the east, or southeast, at the time of the sighting.  The only other possibility to be addressed would be the landing light on an approaching airliner.  PD));34.1174552716953;-118.260974043746
Three red solid parallel lines of light moving from East to West.;2008-04-11 00:40:00;10 seconds;Three red solid parallel lines of light moving from East to West. Moving at a high rate of speed I witnessed 3 red lines of light parallel to each other, but the center line was offset.  The lights moved with each other which means it was either one craft or 3 crafts.  The lights did not blink.  They were solid.  Below is the best drawing I can do with the keyboard.  --------- ----------- ---------   The lights were travelling from East to West from my vantage point crossing through the Big Dipper.  The lines moved perpendicular to their shape.;34.1174552716953;-118.260974043746

The object was south;2009-08-02 21:26:00;12 Minutes;I went out to throw out the trash and looked up at the sky to look at the moon and noticed a glowing object still. The object was south-west from the moon, it seemed to shift form slowly but it stood still. I went inside to tell my girlfriend to come outside to see if she saw the object as well, she did. The object was right above the Griffith Observatory so it seemed from my perspective, the object still non moving glowing somewhat light-red and orange and gradually shifting form to somewhat triangula shape. Pointed towards the direction of the moon. Slowly it began to move after 5 minutes. The moon was south-east from my perspective. The object slowly moved paralled towards the moon, gradually increasing speed still glowing but throughout it made no sound. It crossed through and left without a trace until it was unseen to the eye.;34.1174552716953;-118.260974043746
