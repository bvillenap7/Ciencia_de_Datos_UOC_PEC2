Fast-flashing light crossed the sky at intervals while moving VERY fast.;2020-11-02 18:12:00;6 seconds;Fast-flashing light crossed the sky at intervals while moving VERY fast. Walking the dog with my wife.  We saw a flashing light in the sky, then moments later it flashed 2 very quick times 2-hands distance away moving south across the sky. Within 5 seconds or less it flashed in the same way (2 very fast flashes) in the middle of the sky and flashed again in the southern sky before it passed the horizon.  It had just become dark. We could see no shape just the light.  But it crossed the whole unobstructed sky in less than 5 seconds flashing at intervals across the sky disappearing in-between.  Altitude seemed low but just assuming this due to it's speed across the sky.;34.1174552716953;-118.260974043746
