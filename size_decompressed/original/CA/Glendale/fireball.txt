Apparent meteor apparent meteor;2000-01-02 21:33:00;2 seconds;Apparent meteor apparent meteor As my wife and I were returning home we entered Yosemite Way headed NNw when in front of us about a quarter mile and at about 200-300 altitude there appeared a bright green-blue object trailing a long orange tail. It was out of sight quickly but seemed to be moving at 300-400 mph.
