Swarm of Amber spheres;2007-01-01 00:10:00;13min;Swarm of Amber spheres Myself and a few friends were visiting another friend of ours in Windsor, CA. for new years eve, I believe its north of San Francisco and 30 minutes from Bodega Bay.  A little after midnight on New Years Eve, our whole party went outside to ring in the new year. When we looked up we noticed what looked like a whole swath of stars that were amber in color were travelling in a column, we watched them for about 13 to 14 minutes.  I happened to have a pair of binoculars with me and managed to hand the binoculars to everyone in our party.  From what I saw, when I had my binoculars were these objects were spherical in shape and were slightly pulsing in 1 second intervals.  Some were swirling around one another.  At the end of the 13 - 14 minute window I saw the objects gather in a swarm on the horizon and split off, one part of the swarm going right the others going left with only a couple going straight up and disappearing.  A few minutes after the sighting I noticed a couple jets in the vincinity. Our party had one amateur astronomer and one fireman.  Our astronomer states they were not stars or airplanes. Please contact me if anyone else has reported anything of this sort in the area. Every person in the party is still stunned from this experience as am I, we need to know that we are not crazy.;38.5463;-122.8047
