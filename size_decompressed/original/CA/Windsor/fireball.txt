Glowing Balls of fire 3 Large and 16 small in the sky;2002-03-31 21:45:00;2mins;Glowing Balls of fire 3 Large and 16 small in the sky On easter evening at about 9:45 P.M. While sitting in my hot tub I saw a bright orange glowing light coming towards from the eastern sky heading west.Soon to follow was Two more glowing Orange lights they seem to be scamming the area looking and searching which direction to go. The next thing that happened was that 16 smaller lights appeared in a cluster they also had a orange glow about them. They also stopped above us and then formed a line formattion like birds do. Then they formed a bird like pattern and stated to head south the Three larger lights then reunited together and followed the other sixteen smaller lights. When heading south the larger lights began to spew sparks like a welder would when welding then they continued south. I quickly called my sister in law which lives south of us and she also saw them. Can you tell me what I was seeing? It was not a ordinary sighting. They seem to have intellegnce of some sorts. Also when my sister in law was watching a plane had to manuver it self around them to miss them. Would had come from the Sonoma County Airport around the corner from us.
