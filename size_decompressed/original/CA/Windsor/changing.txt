PD));2019-03-21 23:00:00;2 hours;Taking pictures of moon sky tiny blue dot appeared moving up down side to side changing shapes flashes Observing what looked to be a full moon on 3/21/19, I started taking pictures with my iPhone.  My iphone camera was set on the “Live” setting when I started To take pictures.  Each time I’d raise my camera to the moon a blue object would appear darting back & forth and up & down at times.  The object started as a tiny dot then to a tiny streak of blue light.   I continued to take picture after picture the blue dot streak still moving about changing its shape.  After a while of this I went inside garage to enlarge a few pictures.  There are Many different pictures all with movement (Live) two or three pictures are saucer shaped & when enlarged look exactly like a blue flying saucer. Almost forgot to mention, while in the garage, each time I’d raise the camera, two blue lines would appear in the shot.  Sometimes they were upright in position other times horizontal but always two.  I can’t make sense of what was happening that night, so I am reporting it.  I do have photos of what took place in the moonlit sky on 03/21/19.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));38.5463;-122.8047
