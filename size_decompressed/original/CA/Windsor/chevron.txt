It was about 10:20 PM and me and my girlfriend were out in the backroads of town driving towards home, when I saw 3 lights in the sky, all next to each other. They were amber in color, and appeared to be moving slowly. We then spotted another orange/red light was traveling across the sky towards it. This was traveling pretty fast, and approaching the group of 3. It got in very close proximity to the 3, and all the sudden fell straight out of the sky and turned bright white. It sent chills straight down my spine. I slammed on the gas and tried to get closer for a look at the 3, got one last glimpse of it in a break in some trees, and then did not see it again. This was not very high up, it was lower than most small airplanes fly to the ground.;38.5463;-122.8047
