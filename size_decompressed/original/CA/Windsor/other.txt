Shortly after midnight, my husband and I saw an array of approximately 12-14 small lights.  There were six to seven in a row forming two parrelel rows.  They were moving across the sky, and then clustered together.   Once clustered, they all moved off into the sky where they couldn't be seen anymore.   We have never seen anything like it before!;38.5463;-122.8047

At first I thought it was a star but was alot brighter than anything in the sky.  As I continued to stare at the light I noticed rays of light illuminating from what looked like a sphere.  I noticed faintly that the center was darker almost looked like a dark sphere inside . I counted 9 rays shooting out of the sphere.   This lasted about 20 mins and it was still the whole time but was slowly either fading away or traveling further than I could see.  Eventually  I took a video on my phone with not that much detail and took some pictures on my hi definitely camera.  The results were very interesting to say the least.  I'm glad I saw what I saw.  Feel very lucky to have seen something like this.;38.5463;-122.8047
