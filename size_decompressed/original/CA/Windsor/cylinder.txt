Chrome cylinder hovers at vertical angle 5,000 or more up on a clear cloudless day.  ((anonymous report));1979-03-25 10:15:00;>45 minutes;Chrome Cylinder hovers at vertical angle 5,000 or more up on a clear cloudless day Chrome Cylinder hovers at vertical angle 3,000' (probably much higher) or more up on a clear cloudless day at about 73 degrees from grade and 2,000ft to the NW of Windsor Middle School rear plateau.   The object had to be over 100ft long, over 18 feet in diameter and had 4 extended perpendicular rods with spherical ends in the middle.  The entire unit was chrome and hovering dead still for an hour or more at a 10-15 degree angle (shaped like the Hubble telescope) with the bottom leading edge pointing towards/ in front of/ my general area.  There was no sound.   I alerted the school's principal and he explained that it must be a reflection and did not think it was a UFO.   I was 10 and have never forgotten about it.  I have never seen another UFO since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.5463;-122.8047
