3 Red lights in line pattern above El Cajon/ East County.;2010-01-01 00:00:00;about 15 minutes;3 Red lights in line pattern above El Cajon/ East County. Right as I was going outside to light off some New Year's poppers in my front yard, I looked to some fireworks, but noticed three (3) bright red lights hovering east of my house in Lemon Grove, CA. They looked to be in a line shape, similar to the Orion's Belt Constellation in formation. They were moving slowly southward, with the center light moving slightly back and forth in between the outer two. After about 10 minutes the most southern one began to flash and drop down toward the horizon. The other two remained for another 5 minutes or so then faded out separately. I thought they were maybe some kind of Flare or firework at first, but it just seemed very strange to me. All three others of my family witnessed the event, along with four of my neighbors. I also called my friend in Spring Valley, and her and her father witnessed the event also.;32.7398;-117.027
Yellowish orange lights, maybe spheres released red circles then disappeared in San Diego. ((anonymous report));2016-11-10 20:15:00;2 minutes;Yellowish orange lights, maybe spheres released red circles then disappeared in San Diego. Yellowish orange light appeared in the night sky out of the blue.  It wasn’t a plane, but we couldn’t make out shape, then it dropped 2 distinct small red circles and a smaller third barely distinguishable.  It disappeared, and about 2 seconds later another one followed but this one did not release anything,it also disappeared at about the same distance the first one did.
