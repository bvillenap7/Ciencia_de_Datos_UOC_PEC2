Then I noticed that  there was a red twinkle upon it as well, so I assumed it was a plane or helicopter, but it didn't move and there was no sound. Then it moved, upward and digonal.  I watched it for approximately 5 mins. and noticed it seemed to be floating, swaying on occasion very silightly. Then I had my spouse come outside to look as well. We watched it hoover off in the distance, in the same general vicinty, moving left and right, in circles, etc. But not in an exagerated manner. It would leave brief and light tracers behind it when it moved. I couldn't see the shape, as it was very dark and it was in the distant sky. It was slightly brighter than the brightest star with a red twinkle that seemed to move to different locations around the white light. There was a haze around it, a glow, like stars have. We watched it together for almost an hour or so, then it started to move up, right and away and faded away gradually. Until it looked like just another faint star and then disappeared completely.;39.2777;-123.228
