It started as a point of light, slowly moving through the night sky.  A V of light shone behind it, the V iincreasing in size as it moved forward.  the light was a bright whitish-blue.  After 20 to 30 seconds it popped (like fireworks) splitting into a momentary burst/shadow of in four sections, at which time the point of light (source) dissapearred and a very bright cone (and streak) of blue was left behind.  I thought this might have been a very sophisticated flair, except it moved SOOO slowly and shined light in a very distinct V behind it only.  Strangest thing I've ever seen.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Air show to the northwest, small metallic objects forming circle formations to the southeast 4th appeared out of nowhere.;2002-10-12 14:40:00;3min.;Air show to the northwest, small metallic objects forming circle formations to the southeast 4th appeared out of nowhere. I was on Bernal Hill south of market area SF. I was watching an air show from this vantage point looking north towards the Golden gate bridge. All of the jets were flying between the Golden Gate & Bay Bridges these jets were several miles north/west of my location. I was waiting watching when a glint caught my eye. I watch as three miniscule points drifted east at about 10 to 15,000 feet? Nothing strange about that...Then the three started to circle and formed a separated triangle shape. At first I thought maybe they were birds circling but it seemed really high... but when they rotated the sun glinted off of a metallic surface, which caused them to glitter. They were very very small and hard to track against the blue sky. Suddenly out of nowhere a fourth appeared and they started heading east in a straight line one right after the other away from the city. This all happened directly above the South Of market area of San Francisco between Potrero hill and Bernal hill. Meanwhile the jets were twisting and twirling over downtown and the Embarcadero. One of the tiny metallic objects stayed behind for several minutes circling while the others headed east. Then after about a minute took of after the others and headed over the hill and I lost site of it as I was standing on the west side of Bernal Hill.

Bright light with a long tailing streak moving Westward;2003-09-30 19:45:00;30 seconds;Bright light with a long tailing streak moving Westward Saw a very bright light with a very long streak behind it heading East to West. My guess is that is was a piece of space debris burning up in the atmosphere. It was moving faster that a a jet would move but much slower than a shooting star. The light was quite bright. Mostly white, possibly slightly blue.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Black object hovering in front of clouds in san fransisco;2004-11-12 04:15:00;1 minute;Black object hovering in front of clouds in san fransisco My girlfriend and I were on the train, emerging from the subway to above ground,(we were coming from the airport on the BART) and i was kinda spacing out at the sky, when i noticed a black thing hovering near some low clouds. It looked like a bird, but it wasnt moving at all,and it was kinda far so it was hard to tell exactly how large it was. I saw it for like 3 seconds, and i pointed it out to my girlfriend, but when she look it disappeared behind the clouds. Then 30 seconds later i saw it again and i pointed it out to her. We looked at it for another 15 seconds, but then the train kept going and it either disappeared behind some clouds or a building we went by.(i dont remember exactly) There were other people on the train, but they seemed to keep to themselves as i was pointing it out to my girlfriend. They might have noticed me pointing it out but nobody else looked up to see as far as i know. There were only a couple people by us who would have noticed. San Fransisco has a lot of hills, so i contemplated it being the top of a very tall light or electric post on a hill, but i saw nothing under it, and it was pretty high up,in front of the clouds, i would estimate 500 ft? But i am really bad at estimating, so i could be wrong. I also would like to stress that they were clouds, and not the fog San Fransisco is so commonly used to.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
one or two flying crafts, no lights;2005-11-20 03:00:00;30 seconds;one or two flying crafts, no lights I was standing on the edge of the san francisco bay, looking at the stars, when i saw something in the sky flying by.  What caught my eye was that there were no lights on it at all--you could only see the ambient light from the city reflecting on it.  It seemed a little weird, and I just shrugged it off.  About five minutes later, I saw it (or another one just like it) again, flying in the other direction, and this time called the attention of a couple of friends to it.   No one had any idea what it might be.  We watched it fly north until it disappeared into the horizon/light pollution/etc.  Waited for another 30 minutes or so, but didn't see it again.  Possibly chevron shaped, possibly oblong/spherical--it was hard to tell because there were no lights on it.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
bright white light in sky off Ocean Beach, San Francisco, CA changed color to red and moved slowly North;2008-10-07 19:30:00;30 minutes;bright white light in sky off Ocean Beach, San Francisco, CA changed color to red and moved slowly North I saw bright light out apt. window in sky off Ocean Beach,in San Francisco, CA betwen Vicente and Wawona St.  I first thought it was a plane but it did not move and stood in same spot for 20 minutes before it changed from a bright white light to red and back again and started to move North before disappering behind a tree. I saw the exact same light two nights ago - but it did not change color but got smaller before disappearing. My apt is aprox. 2 miles from beach.  I observed with naked eye and bicnoculars.  I am a regular civilan with no special expertise.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Small white dot flying through sky in San Francisco;2010-03-26 17:20:00;30 Seconds?;Small white dot flying through sky in San Francisco A friend and I were at Dolores Park in San Francisco yesterday.  The incident occurred somewhere between 5:15 pm and 5:25 pm.  It was a sunny day with a bright blue sky. It was cloudless. We were laying on our backs looking up at the sky.  I noticed a pigeon sitting on top of a lamp post that was in the park.  I noticed a small white object floating down to the earth.  I thought the object was a feather that had fallen from the bird.  For some reason, I was fixated on it and watched it float to the ground. I told my friend to look at the feather and pointed out that it was taking a really long time to hit the ground.  All of a sudden (and I know this sounds strange,) the feather went up higher in the air instead of coming down.   At first I thought a gust of wind blew it higher. Then, all of a sudden it appeared to shoot through the sky up and over to the right above some houses.  The way it was traveling did not seem plausible by Science.  It shot FAST across the sky as if the sky was sucking it in.  Like it was traveling through another dimension. I don't know if it was actually a feather that we noticed which drew our attention to the small white object or if the feather transformed into the white object.  But it flew SO fast and high and eventually disappeared.  As it got further away it looked less and less like a feather and more like a tiny white dot that was glowing. Like a shooting start that went up instead of down.  I hope this made sense. I looked around to see if anyone else in the park was noticing it but no one was.  My friend that was with me saw the exact same thing.  I had him describe to me in detail what he witnessed to make sure I wasn't seeing things.  He described it accurately.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Flame-like orange light, moved in a straight line, curved slightly, came to a complete stop, and then after a ew seconds, disappeared.;2011-12-20 19:15:00;4 minutes;Flame-like orange light, moved in a straight line, curved slightly, came to a complete stop, and then after a ew seconds, disappeared. I was out getting my mail and and as I was walking back down my path to my house, I saw a strange orange light in the sky.  It was different, so I stood and watched it.  It flickered a bit and reminded me of a flame, and was colored as a flame also.  It moved different than a plane.  When I first noticed it, it was moving slowly and in a straight line and then curved slightly and came to a stop! Then I knew for sure it wasn't a plane!  It stood still for a while and then was slowly getting dimmer.  Then it finally disappeared completely.  I stood and watched for a while to see if it would come back but it didn't.  It was just the night sky then, and I was in disbelief.  The weather was clear - no clouds at all - only the night sky with the stars (the ones you can see in the City anyway).;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
A light in the sky flying in a zigzag formation that disappeared after a minute or so.;2012-01-02 18:20:00;75 seconds;A light in the sky flying in a zigzag formation that disappeared after a minute or so. Tonight in San Francisco, I saw a bright star in the Southern sky just to the right (west?) of Orion’s belt.  It was too far away to see the shape but it was brighter than most stars in the sky, and it’s a clear night tonight.  It was moving West in a subtle zigzag formation.  After about a minute it slowed and started to get smaller.  It became dimmer and dimmer until it disappeared, all in about 15 seconds. I’m not sure what it was but it did not look like a plane, nor did it move across the sky as a conventional plane would fly, and there are lots of planes in the bay area sky.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Bright purple pulsing pinpoint of light moving erratically over an area north northeast of San Francisco.;2020-08-15 20:30:00;15 minutes;A bright purple pulsing pinpoint of light moving erratically over an area north northeast of San Francisco.  Object was observed flying erratically, first to the west, then turning on a dime to the east, and repeating this pattern at variable speeds, distances and elevations three or four times.  Appeared to hover stationary at one point.  After more movement, it suddenly disappeared (didn’t fade out) and reappeared minutes later, before “blinking out” one last time. A few minutes later, a point of white light further to the east, southeast was seen dropping down slowly and turning partially red as it sank down out of visibility behind a residential building. Some description of directional movement is best estimate, as it is difficult to determine distance and north-south movement from my vantage point.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
