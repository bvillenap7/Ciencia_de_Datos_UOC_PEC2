My husband and I were sitting on a bench at a marina in Berkeley CA looking across the Bay at the skyline of San Fransisco (SF). There;2003-06-30 02:00:00;10 min;My husband and I were sitting on a bench at a marina in Berkeley CA looking across the Bay at the skyline of San Fransisco (SF). There was some generalized fog and there was a cover of clounds above the city. We observed a very dark cigar shaped object move repetitvely back and forth from one end of the city to the other, occasionally dipping into the clouds but never decending below the cloud cover. The object did not appear to be movong fast but it was covering considerable distances in a short amount of time (moving back and forth acros the city in appx 45 sec). The object was signifaclty larger than a plane or helocopter as it appeared in relation to the city scape to be longer than the width of two buildings. The movement, shape and speed was not consistant with any modes of air craft with which I am familiar. The nearest airport is located some distance from the city. We observed the object for appx 10 minutes during which we noted an intersting cognitive phenomenum in which as we ruled out aircrafts that were consistent with our contextual schemata, we became increasingly aware of the unfamliarity of the object. We would be interested in kowing if there were any other sightings in this area. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Rotating dark object that climbed in altitude and traveled southeast;2012-01-25 13:50:00;13:55;Rotating dark object that climbed in altitude and traveled southeast I am a full time student at City College of San Francisco and I also work for a public relations company part-time.  I recently moved to this part of San Francisco.  My house is on a hill and there is a window facing the ocean.  The ocean is about 3 miles away. What I saw was a rising object that looked like a shiny black disc.  When I spotted it, it was a little west of San Francisco State University.  Then the UFO drifted upwards and east.  It revolved horizontally and I was able to see that it was egg or cigar shaped because it would be a small dot and then it would be long and skinny.  When it was long, it was about 3 times the length of when it was a dot.  There was a glare on top of it from the sun. I looked at the UFO more closely with binoculars and it had a black underside and maroon/redish topside. It also appeared to have fins like a fish.  The fins were translucent green and in the same locations as a fish.  A fin on top, a fin on bottom, and a larger tail fin.  It was as large as a blimp but I didnâ€™t see any entry points on the UFO. I was unable to see it after it climbed in altitude and was in front of the sun.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
2 cigar/rectangular UFOs floating over San Francisco.;2016-05-26 10:00:00;10 minute;2 cigar/rectangular UFOs floating over San Francisco. 2 cigar shaped ufos spotted over san francisco with flashing lights.  They floated slowly over the city covered a large distance but rotated in place as if looking around.  I could clearly see it with my own eyes and captured 2 videos on 2 different devices that shows the blinking lights. Video here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYf5a2qUsUw   (look closely for flashing dots after 30 seconds)   Details:  Shape- Long rectangular approx: 6-10 ft long (maybe more ?) x 3 ft high x 1-2 ft thick - almost like an stretched brick with rounded corners, edges didn't appear sharp. Color/Lights Dark matte or metallic color with 2 round lights on either side of the long side.  Lights were mostly green, flashing in a random pulse, occasionally a long stripe of light would flash connecting the dots. Occasionally the lights appeared more red then green.  Flight Pattern: They floated from Buena Vista Hill due east towards Downtown.  They rotated in place, turning along the middle of the long axis in a random looking around type of pattern both clockwise and counterclockwise.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Mystery Giant White Blimp Like Object Over Oakland;2019-11-19 08:00:00;30 minutes;Mystery Giant White Blimp Like Object Over Oakland We witnessed a blimp like object that appeared to be circling the Oakland airport area. It was massive. Had some sort of black unknown text writing and possibly had people below. My girlfriend and I observed from our patio overlooking (with binoculars) and have pictures to support. It had a red blinking light on the bottom and looked very strange.  We've lived here for over 3 years and have never seem anything like it. Our view is of the entire east bay and we can see the Oakland airport on a clear day. However, this stood out.  To start, we've never seen anything like such described. It was huge and from first glance all white. It was easy to dismiss as a normal blimp but in retrospect we've had a change of thought.  Like I stated, we've never seen anything like that before. It stood out. And the next day I remembered how strange it was to observe. So I googled every type of search that would pull it up. Found NOTHING. I mean NOTHING. I find it incredibly hard to believe that everyone in SF didn't comment on it and also take pics. If it was just another blimp why would it not be mentioned online somewhere.  Which leads me here. I can't find a single picture online of this.  I believe it was probably an emergency landing and not intended to be seen. It might have been some sort of military craft. Hard to say. Like I stated, it was easy to pass off as a normal blimp. And sadly, we didn't watch longer to see how it landed. I tried to film it but from our distance it only look like a large white spot. The picture are better. But what we saw in the binoculars is the most compelling. The writing was not legible. It looked like symbols. And it was far from what you would think was a promotional blimp.  If was a normal blimp, we would've seen it before. And the black out of it online makes me believe we weren't supposed to see it.  I think it could be a weather modification blimp that malfunctioned and needed to make an emergency landing. Hope you can provide more insight.  I'm not sure how to send the picture but will if your interested.   Thanks for being here. Hope your not the MIB haha;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
