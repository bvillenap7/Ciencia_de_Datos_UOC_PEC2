I caught up to her as she was heading back to the small parking area. before we got there we saw a white jeep cherokee that we assumed was a park service vehicle there about the thing we saw. as we got closer we found the driver door opened and the vehcle running with it's headlights on. there was another couple by thier car and we asked about the jeep and they said someone must've fallen off the bluff or something.  there was nothing in the paper about any accidents and there was never anything reported about that evening.  we have never forgotten that incident and we've never seen anything similiar before or since.

Soccer Balls over SF;1998-10-01 10:00:00;6-7 Minutes;Soccer Balls over SF I do not recall the date or even exact time of the year but likely it was Autumn of 1997 or 1998 in San Francisco, California.  At approximately 10 AM I was standing in the redevelopment zone now known as Mission Bay, adjacent to the old Bethlehem Steel Yard just 60 yds north of the restaurant/lounge called Mission Rock Resort.  I was drinking coffee and watching the view across the Bay to the east when I saw two white balls just feet off of the deck of SF Bay coming towards me from the direction of the Oakland Airport.  I took these to be two Sikorsky S61 helicopters of the USCG and thought that I was about to witness a test exercise.  However as they came closer into view I realized that these objects had no wings or rotors.   They were soon in good view and the day being near perfectly clear, warm and quiet in my location I could see that they would pass me at near ground level.  As they approached at an estimated 30 mph I could plainly see that they were two separate objects of equal size in the shape of soccer balls, that is they were generally round but had a series of flat sides precisely like that of a soccer ball.  As they neared the edge of the shore they, in perfect close formation, began to climb slightly to an altitude that I estimate as 250-300 ft and passed me only about the same distance laterally.  I was simply awestruck.  I witnessed two fisherman on a nearby dock who apparently saw nothing.   As the two objects passed my location (They made no sound, had no aura, lights or haze around them) they increased their altitude dramatically and climbed to an estimated 1000-1500 feet above the skyline of San Francisco.  It was a weekend day, I believe Sunday and when I followed their progress to the north of me I noticed LARGE numbers of similar objects!   I am familiar with the San Francisco skyline and habits of its citizens and could not identify all of these objects.  A few could have been Mylar party balloons that had gotten away from people and some others were definitely real hot-air balloons in the distance up in Sonoma.  I always kept one eye on these two items while making these other observations.   Upon reaching their maximum altitude the two craft then did a maneuver about each other that I can only describe as a dance, similar to a deux-se-deux of a square dancer.  This was only momentary and then they began, still in formation, to return along the same flight path that they had just traversed.   Since my first sighting of these two vessels perhaps only three minutes had passed.  I knew that they would return my way yet I found it impossible to yell out to the only two others nearby, the fishermen, as I was so transfixed.  I did notice a police squad car approaching at slow speed and briefly thought to hail them down but my astonishment was such that I could not speak a word!  As expected these two objects returned at the same speed, passed me again at the same distance and again dropped down to the deck as they headed back towards the East Bay.  I had no reference to judge their size and can only surmise that they were each about the size of two small autos.  They were Flat (Mat) Hospital White in color and their surface, clearly solid, could have been metal or even fine wood.  There were no windows, lights or protuberances of any kind.  There were no flames, emissions, contrails or noise. As for the great many other objects that I saw over the City skyline that day, some of which I identified as hot air balloons farther away in the distance and others possible Mylar balloons, there were perhaps 100 more objects, most of them shiny metallic.  Most were stationary or nearly so, some actually moved in the opposite direction of the prevailing wind (Which was negligible that day).  I could clearly see that these shiny metallic ones were rotating on their axis in a clockwise direction.  Most made little lateral movement or altitude adjustments.  As I was focused on the two soccer balls I dismissed these others, though I found them quite dramatic. I spent the rest of the weekend awed by this experience and upon returning to work at the SF Public Library on Monday I immediately discovered a flier in the lobby alerting people to the continuing UFO sightings on, around and about the Oakland Bay Bridge in the vicinity of it's Eastern terminus, an area now called South Beach. The flier stated that a CHP unit had observed it one night ( I think I have since read that somewhere else.) and that crowds were continuing to gather. The flier was an open invitation to join the crowd, however I did not. The flier further stated that the local media were aware of the ongoing phenomena but would not cover the story. As I have become so deadened to the UFO issue I did not think to report this to anyone. I promised Peter D. that I would write up this report regardless of it's age.  I lived in San Francisco for over twenty years and spent a great deal of time outside. Indeed I drove a taxi full time for about ten years, 50-60 hours per week.  I am quite aware of the comings and goings of aircraft, flying debris, the relative wind, human activity and so forth in the City.  Nothing that I can imagine can explain away the vast number of odd-acting objects that I observed that day other than the two or three that I noted above. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  One of two seemingly credible reports from the same source.  Other sighting occurred near Ocotillo Wells, California, on, or about May 01st, 1994.  PD));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Moon shaped, reddish-orange sphere (sligtly obscurred by clouds) object quickly descended into the ocean water in the horizon in front ;1999-01-25 01:15:00;4 minutes;Moon shaped, reddish-orange sphere (sligtly obscurred by clouds) object quickly descended into the ocean water in the horizon in front of my windows. At 0112 hrs, on the 1/25/1999, my wife called me into our bedroom with windows (WEST) overlooking the Pacific Ocean.   She was excited at seeing a beautiful object which she thought was a moon.  I looked out and immediately noticed a reddish-orange glowing roundish object on the horizon.  I scrambled to put on my glasses.  We noticed that the object was very far and with its size about 50% larger than the sun when it sets down.  The object was slightly obscured (maybe it was its shape) by the clouds.  It was also quickly moving down into the water.  By the time I found my binoculars and a camera the object was 40% into the water/horizon.   It soon dispeared into the horizon.  The whole experience took about 3-5 minutes.   My wife claimed to have seen the aicraft extinguished its lights as it went over the affected area through her binoculars --- I can't verify that. We also noticed a great number of lights blinking on the ocean horizon, approximately 10-25 miles.  These lights were all evenly spaced between each other, covering most of the horizon visible from our window.  The lights were all white with the exception of the two lights, one green and one red, between which the object disappeared.   These lights were also the closest between each other.   In all there were approximately 8-9 lights  -- to me it seemed that some Navy or something sealed the area of possible activity/landing. This activity seemed unusual to me.  The lights were active as we went to bed 2 hours later. I am college educated and well read.  This is a first UFO experience for both of us.  The next day, at 1645hrs, I called US coast guard in San Francisco to inquire about possible Navy activity, other reports, etc. -- there were none.  Nothing close to my description was logged by anyone.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Object was seen for up to 30 mintues high up over south downtown SF.Bright shiny object We are  entertainers  for kids and  was playing at a brithday party.My name is  ((initials deleted)) .and my wife name is ((name deleted)).When we  finished the party and started to pack up my partner and wife in the act asked me what was that in the sky. My self and another guy said we did not know.At first the 3 of us  thought it was a ballon,but we agreed that ballons don't hovverThen we went through the usual supects,a plane, helicopter. At that point others begin to become interested in the object .We were in San Franciso close to downtown.We were in a backyard of a rec center,facing the bay. To the left of us if we're facing the bay was  the south part of downtown SF. This is where we saw this object sitting still in the sky.It was really high up in the sky so i decided to go and get my binoculars.I zoomed in as close as i could.It looked  like a shining egg just sitting there by this time some 5 mintues had past.Other witnesses started to use the binoculars,they describe a similar sighting. Older kids maybe ages 12 -15 took a look.I knew their eyes was better than mine .They reported seeing a red fireball.I was stunned.We all Begin to take looks, by this time the damn thing begin to move slowly toward the direction of the Bay Bridge. It was still pretty high because i remember first thinking it was a star in the daytime.Anyway I was looking but i did not really see it move, it was like you know it move but when?Next thing we know it had change locations.This is about 15 minutes into this sighting.Once it took another location i took another look and i swear it had lights on the outside of the object flashing.I must confess that i am a Peter Davenport and Art Bell fan but i did'nt expect to see this.At arms length i could not cover this object up.By this time most everyone knew  something special was going on.Then all of a sudden there were 2 objects.It was like it had split into. All concerned were amazed. This was about 20 mintues into the ordeal.Of course out of all the years we've been doing family events this is maybe th! e first time no one had a video camera at the party.At this the second object started to curise right above our heads.One little girl started to say this is scareing me.If it was it 1oclock over the Bay Bridge it headed  toward 4or 5oclock over our heads.When it was right over our heads i took a look in the binoculars and i saw a red plusating craft.I felt really strange. It really hit me that we could be witnessing other dimensions.Most people had that feeling.Anyway the 2nd object headed our way pasted over and went about what seem to be another 2 miles away hovvering over some trees.While the 1st object is still over the direction of the Bay Bridge.The 2nd object over the trees is just there and then it seems the 2nd object spilt into 3rd object but only briefly,maybe once or twice. After about  5mintues or so the 2nd just vanished.Now with our breath taken away, we focused our attention on the first object.It was still there but one weird thing was . We could see the object with our naked eyes as before but now when we tried to see the object in the binoculars we could not find it.It seemed transparent,strange. Then we looked away for a few seconds and looked back and it was gone.We were lost for words.30 mintues is a long time to witness a sighting.We just wonder did anyone else see it. All the people at this party were just regular folks,bringing their kids to a party.WHAT A PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

I had time to show a friend who upon seeing it joked, It must be uploading from the Pyramid Building.   I grabbed my camera and took a few pictures.  They show a fuzzy white dot.

Two solid, bright, sphere shaped objects flying erractly and fast over Pac Heights, San Francisco.;2008-05-10 04:00:00;15 sec;Two solid, bright, sphere shaped objects flying erractly and fast over Pac Heights, San Francisco. Two solid, bright, sphere shaped objects (both larger then a traditional helicopter in total mass) were flying over the Pacific Heights hill area, traveling from East to West. Initially, they appeared to be at 1,000 feet. They were moving about 200 mph, with one object trailing the other. Then the two bright objects began taking their own path, seeming to moving in a wave like motion, I yelled to my partner to look at them, then they moved into the light fog, which made them more noticeable due to the shimmer of round bright light reflecting in the fog. Then, they began to pick up speed, each taking two different paths, the front object rose in altitude rapidly and shot out toward Golden Gate Bridge and disappeared. The second object remained visible for about 3 additional seconds as it appeared to fly away at a lower altitude in more west then the prior. The weird thing was that the round pulsing light object seemed to get brighter in size as it speed off and dissipated into the fog.  These were no traditional aircraft. Secondly, they were not spot lights from the surface to the sky, they were fast moving, silent and erratic flying craft. They did not make normal flight patterns or aerial movements.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

It appeared about 35-40 degrees above the horizon straight south guessing about 3 miles near Daly City,about 400' in the air. It was initially stationary,became smaller as if it were moving away south, then darted left and right,and disappeared.  I was able to gauge the lateral movement because I was looking through overhead utility wires. It wasn't a plane a balloon a helicopter or a bird, because the velocity of the movement was too swift.  It made me very nervous. I was about to call out to a pedestrian but by the time I did it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Single Cherry-red glowing center, fairly large for distance of object, not like a planes blinking red lights. Surrounded by a yellow-orange glow. I'm on an outdoor deck looking East in San Francisco in the Marina District. It came slowly through airspace, from NE to SW, pretty low in sky from my stand point. Went behind building for a few seconds still coming toward my general direction, and reappeared as I moved to corner of deck to meet it, sight wise, and watched the yellow glow disappear and the red center part get smaller - it seemed to now be going up into the sky and quickly vanished. I looked hard for a remnant of a faint light but there was nothing. I thought maybe behind a cloud but then realized I could see many and vast stars all in the area it vanished in - so this would rule out cloud cover. Very odd sighting. In summary it seemed to be fairly low in the sky moving generally toward me. One glowing cherry-red center and an orange-yellow halo which diminished over time to vanish all together, and then the red center grew faint quickly and it vanished from all sight completely seemingly moving in an upward flight into the atmosphere.

Two spheres seen near Sutro Tower-Twin Peaks in San Francisco, CA.;2013-05-12 14:25:00;10 seconds;Two spheres seen near Sutro Tower-Twin Peaks in San Francisco, CA Time & Date: Sunday May 12, 2013, San Francisco, CA approx. 2:25pm Pacific Time Weather: Clear, partly sunny, windy, approx 65 degrees F. Duration of sighting: less than 10 seconds Angle of elevation of sighting: approx. 20 degrees  I was walking westbound on 17th Street in San Francisco, CA approaching the intersection of Castro Street & 17th Street.  I looked up at the large, 300 meter high- communications tower (Sutro Tower) on the hilltop approx. 1.5 miles away from my viewing position and noticed slightly to the north of the tower two spheres. The spheres appeared to be light matte gray in color.  They were both the same size.  No lights, no glowing, no reflection, no shininess.  They did appear to be spinning rapidly, one above the other, very close together.  I would estimate their size to be approx. 25 feet.  The spheres changed position, revolving quickly around the other one to switch position.  The spheres then pulled away from each other (right-to-left) and then quickly moved back together and merged abruptly into one another, became one unified sphere, but still the same 25 foot diameter. As soon as they unified, they instantly disappeared or rather dematerialized.  No smoke, no light, no noise.  Nothing.  Just silently dematerialized. I immediately checked my watch and it was 2:25pm.  I looked around to see if any other bystanders had noticed.  No one on the street at the time was looking up in that direction.  I asked a street vendor if she noticed anything and she said she had not.  I asked another gentleman standing near me (he was focusing on his phone at the time) if he saw or sensed anything and he said he did not.

Whitish/metallic sphere high in the sky over San Francisco CA.;2013-10-02 11:45:00;10-15 minutes;Whitish/metallic sphere high in the sky over San Francisco CA. Location: San Francisco, CA  Date: October 2nd, 2013     UFO sighting report  On October 2nd, 201,3 at about 11:45 am, on a cloudless sunny Wednesday morning in San Francisco, I witnessed a round shaped (it could’ve been disc shaped) UFO flying at a very high altitude going from northwest to southeast direction.  The object was white but it could’ve been silver, it was very high in the sky, way higher than altitudes that regular passenger jets usually fly in this area.  It was flying at a slow speed from my perspective and it was not doing any erratic movements.  At one particular point, it sharply turned east positioning itself right above my head and then it stopped moving and just hovered there for a while, which clearly indicated that this thing was under intelligent control. The object stayed semi-stationary, doing side to side and up & down small movements (again from my perspective), and at one point I felt that the object intentionally wanted me to see it...  After about 10 minutes, the object started moving and after another minute or so I lost eye contact with it as it moved away to the southeast, it was very very high up in the sky.  The best part of this sighting was that I was able to capture a 1:36 s video of the object while it was above my head executing side to side up & down small maneuvers.  The white/silver object although small is pretty clear in the video if you know what you’re looking for.  I was filming it with my iphone camera which does not have a zoom feature (which sucks).  I was tempted to go grab my digital camera which has good zoom but I was afraid I was going to lose contact  with the object if I ran inside the house to retrieved the digital cam (which the batteries turned out to be dead I found out later, so it was the right decision). The convincing part of this sighting is that there were absolutely no clouds whatsoever in the clear skies that day and you can clearly see the round shaped object in the video.  Another interesting side of this experience was that, a few minutes before, I was contemplating the sky in a meditative state of mind sending out thoughts of harmony, joy, love and eagerness for knowledge, I made a request that if there were anybody out there intercepting my thoughts at that moment to please manifest itself somehow, then this object appeared out of nowhere flying from the northwest.  It almost looked like it turned off its cloak device to show itself to me. I was amazed, undoubtedly this sighting was real, it wasn’t an airplane (they don’t stop in mid-air), it wasn’t a weather balloon, and it wasn’t an optical illusion either.  This was a metalic/whitish colored structured flying pretty high in the sky under intelligent control.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
5 pink/orange lights rising over Bernal Hill in San Francisco.;2013-12-31 23:50:00;15 minutes;5 pink/orange lights rising over Bernal Hill in San Francisco We had a small dinner party of 4 on New Years Eve 2013 in San Francisco.  Every year we decide go up to our deck which overlooks the Bay and Bernal Hill for the fireworks around the city.  We decided to head up to the deck at around 23:50. We were all talking with one another then we noticed the lights coming up over the top of the hill and one of them swooped down in front of the hill and hovered.  The others were moving into diamond and triangular shapes.  They continued to hover when the fireworks around the city were going off as if watching a show. It started to get creepy so we all decided to go inside. I posted what I had saw on Facebook and noticed the next day it wasn't just us that saw them, so did hundreds of others around the state.  I can say for sure that they were not chinese lanterns.  They were wobbling up and down like a dot but stationary at all times.  It seemed like there was a thin transparent layer or curtain between us and them which made them look and feel surreal.  Very strange!;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Small sphere observed over San Francisco Bay.;2014-05-25 12:00:00;15 minutes;Small sphere observed over San Francisco Bay My wife and I were on a ferry heading from Larkspur, CA, to San Francisco, CA, on the way to the SF Giants game.  We were nearing the Bay Bridge, in the water between Treasure Island and the Ferry Building.   I noticed a commercial aircraft flying high overhead, heading south.  Near that plane I saw what at first appeared to be a smaller plane in the distance, but near the same trajectory of the commercial airline.  I thought it seemed a little close.   The smaller object appeared to be white in color with a non-descript shape.  The commercial plane continued on it's path, and the small object was observed to be higher up and not moving in a direction.   I pointed the object out to my wife and she also observed it.  At that point, I began to question what it was I was seeing.   The object then seemed to be moving very slowly, across the bay (west to east), all the while the ferry was moving south under the bridge and so the precise motion of the object was difficult to dete! rmine.  However, as we continued to watch the object, it seemed to be extremely high up and more overhead (I had to crane my neck in order to continue observing it). The object appeared to be shinny, round a sphere.  It was small in size, being so high up.  It was not moving position that I could tell, not on a trajectory across the sky. It seemed to be staying directly over the bay.  I continued to observe the object for about 15-20 minutes.  I tried to take photos of it but it was too far away for our 200MM lens to capture it.  The sky was completely clear, bright blue, no clouds, sunshine.   The object eventually just seemed to disappear, and I could not find it in the sky.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Was there about a half hour lying on my back.  Decided to open my eyes and looked up to see something like a large bubble about 8 or 9 inches wide float by about 25 feet up and at a 50 degree angle from my horizon.  It had two really bright lights inside of it.  One in front and one in back.  The one in back flickered really fast while the one in front was steady in it's brightness.  Then I saw another about 10 seconds later and it continued to about 6 of them at different distances and different angles.  All of them heading east over my building.  The last one I got a video of was the farthest out at about 50 feet away.  I've seen orbs before but never this close and never was able to make out so much detail inside them.  The spherical outline was like a soap bubble but less reflection.  I could barely make out a front and back outline but the 2 white lights! inside were quite clear.  The video doesn't show any of the detail I was able to see with my eyes.  I'm left wondering why?  It appears as the usual white orb only but that's not what I saw.  Hard to see it in the video but it's there mid way down traveling from right to left of the frame.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
((HOAX??)) Enveloped by a spherical object with hexagons along the inside that were turning red.;2017-11-06 00:00:00;6 hours;Enveloped by a spherical object with hexagons along the inside that were turning red. Spherical shaped craft, seemed to have hexagons all over the inside that seemed to light up red.  There was a feeling of intense gravity, as if I were way heavier than normal, and like something was pushing down on me.   It came down and surrounded my whole location and stayed there for 6 hours or so.  When these navigate around they are blue grey and black in color and seem to be plasma and variable size.   This was near the Eagle's Point Labyrinth along the pacific trail.  Associated with these are smaller triangular craft with three red lights on the bottom that trail two fibers behind them.   This was early Monday morning. ((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to contact the source of the report, but the telephone number is non-functional.  We strongly suspect a hoax, in light of the content of the report.  PD));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

At that point I took out my camera and recorded.  It then accelerates downwards and to the side behind the buildings near by.

UFO seen on KRON 4 News @ 9 during flight delay report.;2019-10-17 21:45:00;30 seconds;UFO seen on KRON 4 News @ 9 during flight delay report. I have video of a KRON 4 News @ 9 weather and flight delay report. There was an object in the sky completely still. The object was large and spherical with multiple pulsing lights not in any particular pattern I could identify. I was unable to view any stars in the sky at the time, just a cluster of pulsing lights. The craft seemed rather large considering there were commercial airliners in the forefront of the frame and the object, in the distance was still much larger than them.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
