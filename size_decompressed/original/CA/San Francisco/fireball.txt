Giant Orange Orb- Scoop marks - Bright lights in room.;1979-02-23 15:00:00;45-60 seconds;Giant Orange Orb- Scoop marks - Bright lights in room I was nine years olds at the time, playing outside on a San Francisco street... we lived at ((XXXX)) Mangels.  I was into bicycle motocross....I had a ramp set-up in the middle of the street. 5 of my friends were thereâ€¦  I have never spoken to them about it since then.  So a Giant Orange, Red & Yellow fireball came down our street...very slow.  It made NO noise.  It hovered over us going East.... It flew over and passed us then seemed like it took a deep breathe and did the Hyperspace thing.... Recently, I have had scoop marks on my upper arm & my rear end... My wife and I were sleep- she awoke to our whole room filled with bright light.  She couldn't move or talk.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Faster than a plane but too slow for a meteor The object looked like a meteor but moved slower than normal. No change in direction though. Very bright like a star. Lasted about 4 seconds and briefly went out then back on and then ended abruptly. Most likely a meteor or other common object.  Many planes were on approach to SFO so it was likely reported by another.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

I was driving my car on divisadero st. or in that vicinity and what caught my eye was a huge ball of fire behind the clouds. It was big and bright. There was no rocket sound or vibrtations. There was a older gentleman that was riding a bike, his head was looking up towards the sky. He saw it as well. By this time i double parked my vehicle and watch the light dissappear into thin air. No sights followed after that. I never saw the man again as he rode away. I live in atlanta but was visiting family at that time. oh yeah it seemed very close to the earth, about the height a helicopter or small plane would normally fly;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  Please see article.  PD)) ((BEGIN ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE ABOUT LAUNCH)) Air Force Test Missile Out West Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly, said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said. Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show. We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early, Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets. Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is, Gabel said. The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability. ((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

It was very large, perhaps the size of a silver dollar at the end of your outstretched arm.  It seemed like it could have been as close as a few miles off, moving south to north.  I could see the flames burning as if it was a small sun, and moving so slow that the long tail of smoke was rising up into the air.  It never varied its height, just moving silently horizontal to the horizon, then just disappeared in an instant, the smoke still left behind. I noticed some green fireballs in your other data log.  Do you have any idea of what this could have been?  Thanks much, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Two bright orange objects hovering,pulsing lights, akward movements;2009-01-11 00:02:00;2 min;Two bright orange objects hovering,pulsing lights, akward movements We were walking home just after midnight from grabbing some food and I saw a very bright orange light.  And I turned to my boyfriend and pointed it out to him.  Him being so skeptical, I thought he was going to dismiss what I was seeing, but he looked up and said, what is that?.  We both agreed it was not a plane or like anything we have ever seen before.   I am pretty positive it wasnt a plane because planes have red or white lights flashing and are always flying over head as we live near 2 major aiports and seeing so many, this was in no way a plane.  The light was very bright, large and orange in color, wierd in shape (fireball-ish?), like nothing I've seen before. As we stared we noticed that the orange light was very bright and large for being a distance away. It was heading Northwest to Southeast, towards us. The first one stopped, stood still or hovered for more than a few seconds and then headed west. There was a second one behind it, just as bright orange as the first. It was coming from the same direction. It stopped and was hovering. It pulsed as did the first one when it was hovering, almost to the point of dissapperance. It did a small square flight pattern(looked very unatural), and headed west(was out of site pretty quickly once heading west-within 3-4 seconds). The duration was about 2 min and there was absolutely no sound whatsoever associated w/ the objects. My boyfriend is very skeptical, but he said it was like nothing he has ever seen before. The color was just such a bright rich orange color and the flight pattern was very akward. I have no idea what it was, I just know it was a first that I have seen something like this.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

I am almost 13, and I was on a Boy Scout Camp Out to Mt. Tamalpais near San Francisco.  3 other scouts and I were sleeping outside on a tent tarp.  Another scout and I was looking up at the stars.  Suddenly, on the western part of the sky, we saw a round ball of light, flash across the sky, about the size of a gumball!  The scout asked me, Did you just see that shooting star?  I replied saying, That's not a shooting star, it was a lot bigger!   I know for sure it wasn't a comet because it lasted about a millisecond!;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

It moved very slowly and smoothly in the sky and made no sound. It was a deep orange color, and looked like it was glowing.  It was the same color as an orange street lamp, or similar to a fireball, but it was pretty stable looking.  It moved from east to west, then somewhat towards me and then it just stopped. It hovered for about a minute.  It was cloudy and drizzling so I assumed it was pretty low in the sky.  At first glance I thought it was a helicopter by the speed and way it was moving, but the fact that it didn't make any sound and there were no blinking lights, had me intrigued.  I watched it for about 2-3 minutes. It hovered in one spot, then appeared to dim, or ascend up into the clouds until it disappeared.

Fireball type object spotted hovering over San Francisco approx 3mins.;2012-04-06 22:48:00;3 minutes;Fireball type object spotted hovering over San Francisco approx 3mins. I spotted one fireball type object floating in the sky just below the full moon on April 6, 2012 around 22:48 from my apartment window in San Francisco, CA. The object looked familiar from an instance on a Sunday in January on either the first or the eighth. Once I spotted the object, I ran and grabbed my camera and recorded a 3min 10sec clip of the light. The light floated gently in the sky varying in brightness and direction in a slow but consistent rate of speed. Stopping in one place for only a few times and a short period of time. The flight path appeared to waver slightly left and right from my view point. Not resembling what I have seen from planes or helicopters flying over the same location. In appearance, the light resembled closest what I would consider a fireball. Reddish to orange around a dark core though at times the core appeared to flicker with a reddish to yellow hue. I have a BS in Business and Technology and am currently earning my Masters of Architecture degree in San Francisco, Ca. I was the only witness present unfortunately but was able to grab a camera and record the sighting. I believe this sighting tonight is related to the sighting in January due to the similar flight patterns, color and scale of the objects in question. The full moon might also be a similarity as there was one around Sunday January 8th when the first sighting occurred and another on April 6th. Overall, it was quite impressive.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Faster than any aircraft I've seen that is completely silent.;2013-04-09 21:45:00;1 minute;Faster than any aircraft I've seen that is completely silent Smoking outside my 6th floor balcony I saw two blinking red lights from one object, moving much much faster than the usual aircrafts flying over the city.  The object flew silently starting from Russian Hill - 346Â° degrees North traveling NorthEast 24Â° NorthEast towards they he Lincoln highway then changed direction back 10Â° North to Russian hill and changed back to it's original course of 24Â° NorthEast, then disappearing behind the 'One Thousand Green' Apartment building.   This al took place in less than 30 seconds!  The flight speed was very fast, helicopters and airplanes in that distance cannot maneuver changes in opposite directions like that as fast.  Especially with how unbelievably silent it was!  I was approximately 1 mile away from the object, in which that distance I would normally be able to hear any sound coming from any aircraft.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Slowly falling red light with a second smaller white light shooting out of it.;2013-06-30 21:00:00;1 minute;Slowly falling red light with a second smaller white light shooting out of it. I was leaving my boat at pier 39 at about 9pm, and walking on the dock towards the pier, when I saw a fairly large red light falling slowly straight down.   At first I thought it was some kind of flare, but then after about 30 seconds of observing I saw a flash and a smaller white light literally shoot (at a very high speed) out of the red light downwards into the ocean.   The larger red light kept falling at the same speed until it went out of view behind the pier.   I still don't know what that was.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Ball of light moving east - away from SF - appeared to wobble, made a sudden shift, then disappeared in the still-dark morning sky.;2017-05-06 05:00:00;1 minute;Ball of light moving east - away from SF - appeared to wobble, made a sudden shift, then disappeared in the still-dark morning sky. It looked like a star, but then looked like it was moving away from us.  My friend and I were standing on the Embarcadero, looking out toward the Bay Bridge, facing East (toward Oakland).  I rubbed my eyes, I blinked, I asked my friend if he was seeing what I was seeing.   It was definitely moving away from us, but wasn't a plane or a helicopter or a meteor/shooting star.   As he said, it was a wobbler - it was moving slowly and appeared to wobble, then it suddenly shifted to the south and went dark.  It was there, then it was gone.   I got a little video, but I couldn't get a steady shot but I do think you can see the ball of light, almost directly above the bridge.  The only rational explanation we could come up with was a drone, but that doesn't actually make sense.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
