Three dim lights moving linearly in locked, triangle formation, stars seen between them.;2000-06-01 02:00:00;2-3 minutes;Three dim lights moving linearly in locked, triangle formation, stars seen between them This happened over 10 years ago, probably 1999 or 2000. I was walking south-east on 7th street in San Francisco, about 1 block north of the I-80 overpass.  It was sometime between 1:00 AM and 3:00 AM.  I was returning to my office after spending the evening with some friends (I was not intoxicated). I was looking up to see what stars were visible through the light pollution, as it was a clear night.  I had grown up in more rural areas of the Midwest, and enjoyed stargazing, although I had never taken the time to learn more than a handful of star and constellation names. As I looked south, over a low (2-3-story) building across the street, I noticed very distant/faint light moving at a steady velocity against the stars in the background.  The movement was about two-thirds of the way up from the horizon to the zenith.  It was so faint that I would easily have missed it had I not been looking intently in its general direction. As I focused on this movement, I realized that it was three very faint lights in a triangular shape.  The lights were close together, perhaps one-third to one-half the diameter of a full moon overhead.  These lights were moving from a southerly direction to a northerly direction.  Because of the perceived distance, if it had been a single light, I would have assumed it was a satellite and thought nothing more of it.  I did assume it was a high-altitude aircraft, but I was intrigued by the fact that the lights were solid, when I expected to see flashing lights. As I watched, I realized that the formation of lights passed in front of a star, and I could clearly see the star between the lights.  This happened with other stars, leading me to realize that the lights were not on a solid object, but rather moving together in a formation. I watched more intently to see if the formation shifted.  It seemed to be locked very rigidly, and I saw no evidence of the lights moving relative to one another.  I also realized that there was no sound from the craft(s).  (There was little traffic on the overpass that time of night, so I would have heard a small plane, helicopter or jet.)  I don't recall a rotational motion, but it's possible they were rotating around a central point very slowly.  Otherwise, they moved in a straight line, southerly to northerly, just to the north-west of the zenith.  I do not recall if they moved with one light in the lead. I stopped watching the lights after they moved to the north side of the street.  I do not recall if they were no longer visible, or if I just lost interest (after a few minutes, they exhibited no new behavior). The memory of seeing these lights has stayed with me very clearly for over 13 years, and I have been curious what they were.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
triangle formation, up to twenty objects headed north west over city to pacific- silent, fast;2000-12-30 22:00:00;30 seconds;((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  However, please see other reports from California for this date.  PD))   triangle formation, up to twenty objects headed north west over city to pacific- silent, fast interesting thing about this sighting was that it first appeared to be a rigid formation of lights-- locked in a triangle, at first i thought it was a flying wing. huge. 400 feet from outer light to outer light with a bend in the middle. this isn't positive. no sound for referencing distance-- totally quiet, very fast. was already asking my friends to look when it moved and became more lights as we watched, about seven, and became more of a swept V formation of lights... then they all started this cool 'jet ski' like motion, jockeying around... and more lights appeared till there were over twenty... veered off, all lights grooving in a large v. at first it was about five lights that were solid. you know folks i think maybe they turn themselves into 'planes'. i mean, wouldn't you? the whole group swung north a bit. verrrrrrrry nice. we'd like to tell the aliens thanks for that one cool shot. the v formation dropped back into two 'wings' with a central group of about 4 in a leading triangle. so luscious.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Huge, moving, bright formation of lights seen very close to buildings around Lower Pacific Heights, in San Francisco, CA;2002-01-24 19:45:00;2 seconds;Huge, moving, bright formation of lights seen very close to buildings around Lower Pacific Heights, in San Francisco, CA Yesterday (01/24) the sky was particularly clear, so I spent some time looking at the beautiful sky we had in the city (San Francisco, CA). While I was driving home, a couple of blocks from my house, I was on a red light and for a few seconds I glanced up and I saw this HUGE formation of lights! I couldn't believe what I was seeing but I know it was not a reflection from some billboard and it was neither a helicopter nor an airplane! This is the description of what I saw: A bright light at the top of what I believe was the object (I couldn't see the object because it was very dark to determine a shape) and a group of lights horizontally grouped at the bottom. The lights that were at the bottom part were moving very fast from left to right and vice versa.  The bottom lights had a squared/rectangular shape, but the one at the top, was round. They all moved together so they definitely were part of an object. They were also very bright! This object  was moving from west to east slowly. It wasn't producing sound, but what really shocked me was the SIZE of what I saw! I'm not telling I saw something at the horizon....NO...I saw something that was the size of a roof top and was just of few feet above the ground. After that, I wanted to keep looking at it but I had to make a left on the light...and when I tried to find it again...it was gone. I drove for almost a half-hour looking around everywhere but nothing else happened... I'm TOTALLY SURE about what I'm describing! I cannot believe nobody else looked up the sky and saw this object! The event was enough to produce more than one car accident! I hope somebody else in the city could appreciate this event and hopefully they will also report it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the brother of the witness, and found him to be quite credible in his rendition of his sister's report.  He reports that she was quite shaken emotionally by the experience.  They will submit an illustration of what   We would welcome reports from anyone else who might have witnessed this event on Thursday night, January 24, 2002.  PD));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
I saw 3 formated UFOs. They changed formation slightly and were moving to the east.;2003-01-06 17:00:00;20sec.;I saw 3 formated UFOs. They changed formation slightly and were moving to the east. I saw 3 formated UFOs. They changed formation slightly and were moving to the east. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter, When I saw them first I was thinking they were aircraft and it looked like them. However, the light(let's say they were slightly glowing) were changing their brightness and then I thought it might because of cloud or fog but I could also see many of stars so I was pretty sure there were none of them(cloud or fog) at that moment. Second, the space between each three of light were looked equal but slight after a few second the space changed so that I believe they are not aircraft. It was only a few second which I saw them and I am not so pretty sure.  However, I am so glad if this report might help you. Best regards, ((name deleted)) ((END));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Light Color Formation Shapes Changing;2005-06-20 21:45:00;15 minutes;Light Color Formation Shapes Changing Saw a light formation - constant changing colors of one shape into another shape happening at the same time. Shapes include triangle, diamond, square, and ring. A fifteen minute duration. About 700 ft or less in a distance from me (two big blocks from me) without my looking upward or neck movement. Possibly above the treetop level, about 100' above the ground level. My first night UFO sighting. I think a helicopter saw the whole thing from the beginning, possibly before I saw it. The UFO location is in the city on a clear night sky. I wonder how many witnesses have reported the sighting. The actual sighting is more serious than what I have imagined from hearing the UFO stories through the internet and broadcasting. The sighting videos may not appear dramatic, but in real life, it's very different. If there is a daily alert article or column published in a daily newspaper based on the events, it can be most appreciated to the concerned ones.

A very bright star-like light caught my eye and I stared at it for a while and noticed it was pulsating and drifting against the wind.  Suddenly, another star popped into view and flew around the first star.  I completely ignored the Blue Angels and watched these lights.   About 10 minutes later, a red light came into view.  It was as if it just appeared out of thin air.   The three lights drifted around each other and soon formed a perfect triangle shape.  The triangle formation then moved to the South in perfect formation and moved over the Bay Bridge.  The red light disappeared first, and then the stars seemed to rise higher until they were out of view.  I wonder if anyone else saw them?;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Three amber ovals quicly transited the sky above San Francisco in loose formation at high altitude;2008-02-04 02:00:00;60 seconds;Three amber ovals quicly transited the sky above San Francisco in loose formation at high altitude Witnessed three amber colored oval shapes move across the horizon from East to West directly above San Francisco. They appeared to be at very high altitude and so were two or three times as large as the biggest stars in the sky. They were amber in color but it was more of a glow than a direct light source. They moved very quickly, much faster than any conventional aircraft as they went from the edge of the eastern horizon to the western skyline in about one minute. The objects flew in formation, but were constantly moving around one another in erratic sideways and diagonal movements that conventional aircraft are incapable of. While the movements were erratic they did seem coordinated and with purpose. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

observed v-shaped formation moving from ENE to W over evening sky for approx 10seconds;2008-03-02 21:45:00;10 sec;observed v-shaped formation moving from ENE to W over evening sky for approx 10seconds My wife and I were outside on our deck looking at the constellations.  Our deck faces northern sky and has unobstructed views of the SF bay.   We observed a v-shaped formation of about 9 to 11 lighted objects moving from ENE in a general W direction at approx 65degrees above horizon.  The objects appeared distinct and moved relative to each other but maintained the general shape of the formation taking approximately 10 seonds to move across the sky.   The night was warmer than typical and sky clear  the brightness of the individual objects equivalent or slightly fainter than average star that evening.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
I saw three lights that stayed still, then moved with contrails and made a perfect row, again staying motionless in line.;2008-03-05 06:28:00;6 minutes;I saw three lights that stayed still, then moved with contrails and made a perfect row, again staying motionless in line. I was standing at a bus stop facing East (approximately).  Above the horizon, I first noticed a small white light which looked like a star, but there were no other stars visible in the sky.  In a moment I noticed an identical white light above and to the right.  It started to move and left a clear con-trail.   After a half minute the first light also started to move upward with a contrail.  They both stopped and stayed.  A third light was then seen above and to the right of both.  It moved down with a contrail and stopped so all three lights were in a perfect row, diagonal.  They stayed for at least a minute perfectly still with no contrails visible anymore.  At that time my bus came and I left, but as the bus circled around (about 3 minutes later) for one last view, I still saw two of the lights staying.  I took three pictures with a low res cell phone but I can't see anything on the images.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Formation in western sky, 4 blue lights, San Francisco, Sept 21, 2017 at 20:02pm  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a lens flare.  PD));2017-09-21 20:02:00;Seconds;Formation in western sky, 4 blue lights, San Francisco, Sept 21, 2017 at 20:02pm I was crossing California street, heading north on Octavia in San Francisco the night of September 21, 2017.  I noticed the crescent moon in the western sky and quickly snapped a walking picture as I crossed the street.   I didn't notice anything in the sky at the time I snapped the picture, nor immediately afterwards.  Once I finished crossing the street, I noticed this strange object in the sky of my photo, but again, nothing was in the sky.  I somehow captured this thing by chance on my phone's camera. Location is California and Octavia Sts in San Francisco, facing west.  Time is 20:02pm. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a lens flare.  PD));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Hundreds of crisscrossing star-like objects.  ((Starlink satellites??));2019-12-22 18:00:00;unknown;Hundreds of crisscrossing star-like objects A friend was outside at a party and came to tell us what he was witnessing.  About ten of us went outside and saw what I would normally think of as a satellite, but rather than one or two there were possibly a hundred of these star-like/satellite-like objects crisscrossing the sky in straight lines.  Often it looked like two would almost crash into each other, but they all avoided contact.  There were planes in the sky, but these were much, much higher than aircraft would go.  After a while we saw less of them and the cold temperature inevitably brought us inside.  I tried videoing them but they were too high.  I’ve not seen any reports online as of 12/23 about this.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
