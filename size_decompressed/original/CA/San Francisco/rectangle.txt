Unusual object flashing sequencial red lights over Ocean Beach Area in San Francisco.;2014-08-28 19:45:00;15 minutes; FranciscoUnusual object flashing sequencial red lights over Ocean Beach Area in San Francisco. August 28th 2014 – Approximately from 7:45pm – 8:00pm. This evening, as I was leaving my house in the outer Parkside district of San Francisco,  (I live on 44th Avenue), I noticed an object in the sky westward with flashing sequencial Red Lights.  The Fog had already began to cover most of my view of the sky, which means I would not be able to see any stars tonight. However, Commercial Planes coming from and leaving San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose would still be visible by their flashing navigation lights upon departure and approach to their respective airports.  This was not one of them.   My neighbor also noticed the object and we both attempted to try and figure out what it might be.  The object remained fairly stationary for about 15 minutes.  Occasionaly it would appear to drift to the right, then to the left, and then return back to its original position. Both my neighbor and I suggested that it might be someones toy drone that they were flying above the Fog (I would estimate that it would have been at least 5  to 15 feet across to account for the number of lights on the object).  With that said, I still can not ruled out that I was looking at something else, not man-made. After watching it for 15 minutes the object began to move westward towards the Pacific Ocean while also drifting northward and southward in a pattern similar to a sign wave. After It moved far enough away, I lost sight of it due to the roof of my neighbor's house across the street from my house. Red Light Sequence:  &lt--------------*-&gt Ooooooooooooooo.oo ^ All Red lights except for the Right most light would sometimes appear to be blue, white, or green in random order.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Flying/hovering rectangle in San Francisco.;2014-08-30 04:15:00;5 minutes;flying/hovering rectangle in San Francisco I submitted something earlier, but typed up more details, since doing some internet research, and now understanding that this is a very REAL thing that people actually know about!   August 30, 2014.    At about 4:15 a.m. sighting I usually wake up once in the wee hours of the mornin, and ritualistically, I then go to the kitchen to get a “swig” of orange juice.  I had just done that and was going to go back to bed, but remembered that the gated parking garage, adjacent to the short “high-rise” condo complex that I live in, was not gated for the past two days.  Since I have a vehicle in that lot, and the vehicle is exposed to the street, I decided to take a look out of my living room window, which overlooks the parking lot, to check on my truck.  I had been a little worried about the truck overnight, because we have a ton of auto burglaries on our street, and in general, a lot of scuzzy people walking around up to no good late at night, early a.m. In order to get a good look at the parking lot, I had to lie down (on my belly), on my carpet.  We have a large window but the shade is always drawn, so I decided to lie down and look out the window.  Truck was fine and I didn’t see anyone around but I noticed some lights on in a dilapidated building kitty corner to ours.  Since I wasn’t feeling sleepy, I went and got my binoculars and took a look.  I was checking out the dilapidated building when it happened. I THINK I heard the low hum first.  The rest, I am absolutely 100% sure about.  I looked to my left, and a GIANT rectangular, flat, object was “floating” slowly in my direction from up high – gliding long side up, and then closer and closer.  It sort of “twisted” slowly, which was a movement that I found incredulous for any manmade air craft.  It made no sense.   It then hovered for a time (maybe 2 minutes?) and it was “facing” me at a diagonal/slanted  angle.  There was a white light (not blinking) on each corner of the craft.  In the first moments of seeing this thing, my brain was trying to categorize it as an airplane or some kind of military jet and I couldn’t understand why there were only white lights as I know that our aircraft use colored lights to indicate port side or starboard.   Then the shape of the object was clear to me.  It was SO CLOSE and SO LOW.  And since it hovered for what seemed like a long time, I had a long time to look at it.  But even so, I feel fuz! zy about what it really looked like with specific details.  I know that at the moment I realized it was absolutely a UFO, I was in absolute shock at what I was witnessing.  Then, it put itself on a more horizontal level, and glided up, and headed in a northern direction. I live in a part of the city that has heavy construction so I speculate that the craft was interested in all of the construction going on, but I also assume it knew I was watching it. My husband was sleeping in the other room.  I didn’t call out for him because I didn’t want to disturb what was happening by making a huge commotion, and even though I wished so badly I could go grab my camera I didn’t want to miss a moment of what I was seeing. Weather:  it was very, very dark out (for an urban city).  Our street actually is not very well lit, which is unusual for the neighborhood.  The sky was dark, but I could tell it was clear overhead and I could see off on the northern horizon that there was a heavy band of low fog.  That was the direction the craft took off for. I could NOT believe what I was seeing.  To say the experience was shocking is an understatement. Conditions:  practically pitch black with some city lights.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
One huge cigar and one huge rectangular object floating over S.F. Bay just north of San Francisco..;2016-06-03 21:45:00;10 minutes;One huge cigar and one huge rectangular object floating over S.F. Bay just north of San Francisco. One huge rectangular and one huge cigar shaped object seen hovering side by side over S.F. Bay.  Through binoculars I watched a semi-transparent yellow orange rectangle with a huge cigar object on the left manuevering and moving very slowly near it.  This rectangle did not look solid and seemed to fade in and out while changing shape and color.  This object took on the shape of a glowing lampshade at times and at other times it changed shape lengthwise.   Multiple cigar or disc shape objects appeared in a group of 3 at 9:45 P.M. and at 9:52P.M. a second group of 2 cigar objects and the rectangle appeared side by side.  These cigar objects were much smaller than the first object seen hovering near the rectangle.   After about 10 minutes the rectangle basically just faded away. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be sober-minded and sincere, in describing his sighting.  However, we do not understand why other witnesses have not submitted other reports, given how dramatic an event the witness describes.  PD));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
