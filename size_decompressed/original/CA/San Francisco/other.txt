It was approching dusk but there was a lamp post approx 40' south.I looked upward at the edge of the buildig and noticed somthing moving at the edge.Suddendly I saw what appeared to be a small-15'x4'wx3'body h x 6'fin-boat shaped object approx 25' at a 70 degree angle to me. The object was silvery with a soft orange tint-it made no noise-had a slight glow-the sides of the ''boat'' were angular like a boxy rowboat,with a box type double segmated ridge around the center.A large fin double was on the rear of the craft- it hovered in place for approx. 10 sec.-when suddendly a second craft dropped to its right side-this was the second 'fin'-they hovered side to side for approx 1 min--they were so close I could have litterly hit them with a rock-I went into a state of nervous,elated shock-mostly with the realization that I was actully haveing this experience-I had a strange mixturs of emotions- a blend of joyus fight or flight urges-I wished to go with them but I was nervous that they might actully comply with my thoughts- after hover-they suddendly took off-traveling at a high rate of speed,banking up and around the side of a ten story building westward- within 20-30 seconds they were over the Golden Gate Bridge-appearing as two orange lights.-This is my only experience I can swear too as being an actual ufo sighting-but I was so close-that I am 100% convinced that they were exactly what I claim them to be.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Large sphere and cylinder space junk reentering atmosphere southeasterly of San Francisco probably in Central Valley or Nevada.;1997-12-01 12:00:00;20 seconds;Large sphere and cylinder space junk reentering atmosphere southeasterly of San Francisco probably in Central Valley or Nevada. First of all I have seen an upper atmosphere/space vehicle launch from Vandenberg AFB when I was in San Diego and noticed the perfect cone of the rocket exhaust. Now that was similar to what I saw on this day except they appeared to be reentering. In San Francisco driving south on Highway 101 before Silver Street, I saw in the upper atmosphere at about 11 o'clock and to the southeast two objects. One was circular, probably a sphere, and the other was an elongated rectangle, probably a cylinder, like a rocket body.  I got several glimpses between watching the traffic. I was surprised it was not on the news because it was so obvious. The objects were descending, not much at first but it was easy to tell that the descent was like a parabolic curve because the last I saw them the attitude was almost directly down and they had moved from 11 o'clock in the sky to about 9:30. The objects had cone-like vapor trails. The cylinder was at an oblique angle to the direction of travel and to the cone trail.  Their final direction was SE sort of towards Mt. Hamilton but much further away I think. The entire incident was less than 30 seconds probably about 10 to 15 seconds. By the time I got to the next offramp they were gone. The size of the cylinder and cone-trail was about a little bigger than a full moon, maybe larger as it descended. The sphere's cone trail was roughly about ¼ as big as the cylinder's cone trail. It was hard to see the sphere and cylinder, sort of like a very distant, high altitude jet. Together they occupied a section of sky about 4 to 8 moons across. They traveled pretty much together even though their relation to each may have changed some.  They were not attached, but probably were attached at one time. It looked like a reentering rocket and satellite that would crash somewhere. If needed I may be able to give a good date and line up from the freeway to some hills and the objects.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Military Fly By in San Francisco Bay;2001-03-15 18:00:00;10 Seconds;Military Fly By in San Francisco Bay I want to add to a report I saw at ufoXfiles.com. The report described a UFO sighting in San Jose at approximately the same time. I didn't see the object reported in the report, but I think I must have saw our military tracking the UFO. I was driving across the Golden Gate Bridge at 6 pm, on my way into San Francisco for a night class when I just about died. Right before me a black jet fighter crossed very low over the Golden Gate Bridge, during rush hour traffic! I looked around to see if others saw what happened, but eveyone seemed completely unaware. I watched as the jet flew around the Bay, going over to the East Bay then moving South. I was unable to keep track of it after about 10 seconds. I asked if anyone else saw it when I arrived at school. And I watched the news to see if there were any reports. Nothing. I have seen the Blue Angels fly into the Bay many times, so I am familiar with the military aircraft. But, I have never seen anything like this before. This fly over was definately an unusual event. I was very nervous because I thought that maybe a foriegn aircraft may have been in the area, or a pilot had gone crazy and was going to do a fly by for fun. Little did I know something really foreign was in the area!;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Orbs appearing in increasing infrared light from setting sun.;2001-07-22 17:30:00;10 minutes;Orbs appearing in increasing infrared light from setting sun. I was working out at my gym in San Francisco.  I believe it was a Sunday afternoon. I was in between sets weight lifting sets and I staring out the window.  As I looked up, I noticed saw a small airplane (propeller) crossing the sky.  I was facing south west and the sun was going behind some buildings.  It was a clear day.  Few clouds.   As I was watching the small plane fly over (it was headed NW), I noticed what looked like one of those small mylar balloons pass between my view and the low flying plane.  I got up from my weight machine and walked over to the window to get a better look.  What was strange was that it was difficult to focus in on.  They seemed out of focus to me.  I could see that there was something there but I had a hard time keeping my eye on it.  But I kept staring at it expecting it to move with whatever way the wind was blowing.  But it didn't move in any particular direction.  It simply seemed to float around a very small area in the sky.  I don't think one of those silver mylar baloons would do that.  They would probably float away.  But this orb did not.  I thought it was reflecting light but I think it was somewhat bright.  Here is the weird part.  Once I got used to looking at it, all of a sudden other orbs popped out at me.  They all seemed to be floating around each other.  They didn't cross paths or move over each other, but they did seem to waver around a bit.  They were all shiny and somewhat bright.   I've since thought about it and realized that the setting sun might have had something to do with why they popped out into my view.  I think increased infrared light from the lowering sun has something to do with being able to see them.   I've since seen the Mexico City ufo video footage and realized that my orbs look just like those UFOs.  I don't need to be contacted by an investigator but if you want to call please feel free to do that.  Unfortunately I didn't have a camera on me while I was working out.  However, I now keep a camera cellphone on me, just in case. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Moved like a snake thru the sky. It was 12:30 PM on September 21, a very clear day.  The object was white, two round spheres connected with what had the flexiblility of rope (the connector).  It was being propelled through the sky by the rope-like connector.  The connector moved like a snake slithering through the sky.  It was moving faster than any plane I have seen.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Bizarre high altitude, rapidly moving, thin disk-shaped cloud or contrail, surrounded by waves of thermal energy.;2005-04-19 17:45:00;15 minutes;Bizarre high altitude, rapidly moving, thin disk-shaped cloud or contrail, surrounded by waves of thermal energy. At around 7:45 PST we were standing on my back porch looking at the splendid sunset and I noticed a very short contrail-like object in the sky to the west.  The object appeared to be moving at a very high altitude.  You couldn't make out any physical detail, but it was clearly not moving or behaving like an aircraft at high altitude.   I grabbed a 10x42 pair of Nikon binoculars and we placed them on one of the staircase posts on my back porch.  We could get a pefectly still view of what appeared to be a bizarre disk-shaped cloud moving obviously at a great rate of speed and height.   But the truly bizarre aspect of this oject was the waves a thermal energy surrounding the thin, disk shaped moving contrail.  Both my roomate and his lady friend also viewed the object through the binoculars, and both were mystified, if not blown away at what they saw.  My roomate is an experienced pilot, who at one time was going to get a commercial airline pilot's license. He stated that he had never seen anything like what he witnessed tonight.  He will contact you shortly to give his version.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
At roughly 10:10pm, on Tuesday, October 17, 2006, I went outside to have a cigarette. The observations that follow took place while I;2006-10-17 22:12:00;5 seconds;At roughly 10:10pm, on Tuesday, October 17, 2006, I went outside to have a cigarette. The observations that follow took place while I was standing approximately 30 feet above the ground, on the back staircase of my apartment in San Francisco, California.  Almost immediately after walking onto the staircase, I noticed what quickly revealed itself to be a large bird, probably a bird of prey, flying from the Northwest to the Southeast, perhaps 100 feet above me. It was an unusual sight as far as I know, birds are diurnal creatures. I could see the bird clearly and made a mental note that this was probably a result of the city lights reflecting. I watched it pass above my head.  Just as the bird had passed directly above me when I was distracted by something in the sky traveling in almost precisely the opposite trajectory as the bird. My most immediate thought was that I was looking at an airplane. The object passed directly over the bird I’d been watching, traveling in what looked to be exactly the opposite path.  It’s difficult to reconstruct the order of my impressions of the object. I will do my best.  My first unusual impression was that I couldn’t identify the sound.  At the time I thought little of it, but in the way that one tries to identify the sound of an aircraft (Is it a plane? vs. Is it a helicopter?)  I came up empty. The sound was a mechanical, aeronautical sound that (I am trying not to characterize this retrospectively) that was close to that one would expect from a jet airplace than that of a helicopter, but was not the sound of an airplance nevertheless. It was an industrial, aeronautical sound that I could not decisively identify.  I had what I must in fairness describe as a mild sense of confusion driven by the fact that in addition to my inability to precisely identify the sound I was hearing, there was something not familiar about the color and intensity of the lights themselves. Given the volume of the sound (Again, I am describing as best I can thoughts and impressions that occurred in fractions of a second in real time) I had the impression that the aircraft was higher than the bird I’d been watching but low enough to make a strong sound--less than 3000 feet for sure. The lights seemed duller (less bright?) than they should have given the other variables. They were a dark red, or a blurry red--it was like a dulled orangeish red.  I have made dozens of attempts since the event to draw the distribution of the lights I saw on the object. The best description I can come up with: The representation of 5 on a standard die, with an additional light in between the two rightmost dots. ((NUFORC Note:  The formation did not survive the transfer from e-mail to our database.  PD))  •• • • ••     This pattern of lights moved from Southeast to Northwest for roughly 4 seconds. The part of the experience that was truly extraordinary came after the 4 seconds. As I watched with mild interest, the following happened what I would call the lead light (the light farthest to the side of the direction in which the object was moving) reversed its postion. It took less than 1 second to do so in that time, the lead light traveled clockwise until it occupied exactly the oppose position it had before. The object now looked like this:  •• •• ••   Then, in a fraction of a second and from my point of view, the object seemed to tilt in such a way that the western or leading edge went upward and the eastern or trailing edge downward. I say this not because it was directly visible as such, but because that was impression in the moment: the leading two lights disappeared from view, but I could still see the rear 4.  Almost immediately thereafter (much less than 1 second), the entire object vanishedfrom view. Watching, I did not have the impression of something speeding away. It seemed simply to vanish.  That is what I saw tonight. I have never seen anything remotely like it, and I have never before had a disposition one way or another vis a vis UFOs.  Please let me know if you can explain this event. ((name deleted)) San Francisco, Calif. (808) 232-((number deleted));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Blimp shape with red marking or door on the side?;2007-01-21 14:00:00;5 Seconds;Blimp shape with red marking or door on the side? A friend of mine and I were on an incredible bike ride through a somewhat busy street in the middle of the Presidio Park on our way to the Golden Gate Bridge.   At that moment I was riding by myself, no one around me and my friend ahead of me about 75 yards.  The trees block your view of the bridge and water every now and then, but when the tree line opened up I took full advantage of my chance to get a nice view of the bridge and the bay while still riding.   At that moment I looked to my left to view the bridge and the surrounding hills across the bay, I then saw an object that is hard to explain.  At first I thought it was a coast guard helicopter but this object was round and floating still.  It was a blimp shape with a slight edge on each side forming kind of a saucer, but it was more blimp like in shape, definitely shiny metal.   The thing that stood out the most was a red marking of some type, looked like a red door on the side of it or something.   I was going really fast on the bike at that moment and the tree line blocked my view of it, yelling for my friend to stop, I explained to him that I had just saw something odd, we headed to a side road to get a view of where I saw it, he thinking I've lost my mind at that moment, and me too, it was gone, of course!  I'm hoping someone has seen what I saw that day and reports something similar because it was floating about the same height as the top of the bridge, and was near the bridge on the east side.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

I was on my friends roof having a late night night cap.    All of a sudden we both looked up and there was this bright light above us.  It looked like a bright colored boomerang.  It was a clear night so it stood out pretty well in the sky.    We also noticed a redish and green light underneath it.  The object made no sound.   We were so scared that we ran into my friends building and viewed it from her window.   The object stayed outside the window for 10 minutes.   We didn't want to watch this anymore so we decided to call it a night.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

On this particular day I noticed a number of small white ball-like objects floating in the sky. They appeared to be floating adrift with the wind.  During this time I also saw floating about 400-500 feet in the sky what appeared to be a rectangular net-like object which looked like it had 2 balls tethered to each end.  It was drifting westwards from me towards the ocean. These objects may not have been ufos but weather or atmospheric testing devices.

Portal opening up & a ball of light falling out of it to the ground at night.;2012-02-12 02:20:00;3-4 seconds;portal opening up & a ball of light falling out of it to the ground at night That night I stepped out onto my balcony on the 7th floor (top) in a high part of s.f. & right in front of my eyes, far up in the sky I saw what I can describe as a portal opening up & a kind of sparkling ball of plasma light fell out of the center of this slow motion blast (the portal) & as it fell downward it was leaving a staggered trail of glittering plasma light.  The event didn't light up the night sky or make any noise.It was kind of mellow & magical feeling and I know for sure it was no dud of a fireworks rocket or something because there would've been some sound & I would've seen the thing being shot up into the sky if it was some 4th of july dud rocket.  Because what I saw happened right before my eyes from start to finish.  And the streams of energy that made up the blast effect looked way different than any of the 4th of July firworks I have ever seen & the slow speed at which it opened up you could tell it was no firework.   The ball of light fell at normal speed & probably over the water but the horizon line of the city was a little foggy so I couldn't tell if it may have landed over land.  There were about 12 to 14 thick streams of light that made up the initial portal opening.they weren't too bright & they just faded away as the ball of light leaving the staggered trail of plasma fell out of it.  I just felt really lucky seing it & it made me a believer of things from other dimensions coming into ours like some of the skinwalker ranch stories.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
