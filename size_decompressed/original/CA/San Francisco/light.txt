A pulsing light that ascended at 90 degrees;1974-10-15 22:30:00;3 minutes;A pulsing light that ascended at 90 degrees In the early 1970s, while still attending college, I was on a late-night flight from San Francisco to San Diego.  As we were flying south, I was looking out the window to the west, and saw what I first thought was Venus, but then I realized that there were clouds passing behind it, and it seemed to be moving at basically the same pace as our jet.  So I assumed it must be another plane.  But as I studied it, I realized that it was too bright to be a plane, and there were not the typical blinking green and red wing lights around it.  As I was staring at it trying to figure out what it was, it began to pulse.  Not blink, but pulse, at first slowly and then faster and faster.  As it began to pulse very quickly, it suddenly shot straight up, not at a curve, but a 90 degree ascent, and was gone in less than a second.  I have no idea what it was, but it defied all the law of physics as we know them today. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The brightest is in the  western sky and looks like a very bright star. What distinguishes it from a star is that it bobs and moves periodically it exhibits an purposely changeing radiance (decidedly more ray-like than eminance) and there is a blinking white light apart from the main star body. Positioned at about 11 o'clock is a single blue green ray fixed in position and length. The rest of the rays once again, seem to shift and change. To the casual observer it would appear as a bright star. The other 4 objects are also star like though not as bright (possibly due to being further away) and display an artificial  wagon wheel- like radiance. This experience is available to anyone in the bay area all night, every night. They are clearly wanting to appear as fixed stars even while waivering some. The one bluegreen ray and the periodiodically blinking light just off to the upper right and the waivering just won't allow for real star status. I am quite frankly surprised that there haven't been a rash of reports on this. It is once again quite astounding in that the entire Bay area has regular nightly access to a genuine sighting every night. One need only venture out and take a close look at the brightest star in the lower western sky to find that it is in fact an altogether wondrous non-star.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

On the above date I was stationed on The USS Abraham Linclon.   One particular night I was on low visibility watch due to rain in the area.  I would estimate we where about 20 miles north of San Francisco when this incedent happened. When on watch that  night I witness a flash of light about 2 o clock up into the night sky.   About in 10 seconds later I witnessed the same flash moving in a counter clockwise movement.  I called up to the bridge and ask if they had any air contact on there radar. They answered negative.  I noticed after the bridge that the light continued in the same direction.  I estimated by the intervals in of flashing light that the object would be directlly in front of the ship.  At that same moment the bridge began yelling  We have surface contact!  Do you have a visual!  I answered negative, I see no surface contact.   Then in an instant, the surface contact disappeared.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Object was in the wrong area and wrong time of day to be Venus, was decidedly not an airliner-it didn't move. I compared the objects location against the edge of a building to ensure that apparent motion was due to cloud movement. Verified with two passers-by that yes-object was there and unmoving. They left shaking their heads, making stupid comments. Observed a bright white light, much like a star, but much more striking especially against a blue daylight sky. A wall of clouds finally blew across my line of sight.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
A white star-like object moving south off the Pacific coast;2000-05-18 20:55:00;45 seconds;A white star-like object moving south off the Pacific coast I was standing on a 7th floor deck of a building in downtown San Francisco looking up toward the North when I saw what appreared to be a faint star moving southward. At first I thought it was a plane way out in the distance but then it stopped and just hung there, then proceeded again in the same direction it was originally moving. It was a whitish light just like a star and was pretty far away. I would imagine that when I started watching it, it was over the ocean off the Marin coast. Anyway, after it started moving again it seemed to arc upward a bit and then descend again. Then it stopped a second time. When it started moving again it went almost straight upward for a couple of seconds then moved down and continued on it's original path. I knew then that it was not a plane and I don't think satellites stop like this. It soon disappeared from my view as there was another building close by that blocked my sight. When I last saw it it would have been off the coast of Ocean Beach in San Francisco from what i could tell.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

We were at San Quentin village on the little beach. I looked up into perfectly clear blue sky and happened to see 3, very small points of brilliant white light. The lower 2 seemed to be one over the other and the top light was equidistant from the other 2, but to the left, about 15 degrees. The 3 lights were joined by 2 very thin, black lines. I asked my brother if he saw anything up in the sky, without showing him and he described what I saw. I then went over to my 21 y/o niece, and without describing to her what I saw, asked her. She described the same  lights. The 3 lights were due south of San Quentin Prison, and possibly directly high over San Francisco. It wasn't possible to estimate the distance - but they were, as best I could tell (I triangulated with a tree branch) motionless over the city (or at least in that direction). There was an air show down in South Bay that day and 2 military jets did do a low pass over us before we saw the 3 lights. We saw the 3 lights for 30 to 45 minutes and then as my brother and I were watching, they seemed to flit up and disappear. They left no vapor trails Their light was almost lazer-like, dazzling and just a pinpoint with some slight flaring. I am also a pilot and can state that it wasn't a satellite, a plane, a balloon or blimp. About a year later, I ran into my sister-in-law's brother - and - he recounted that he, from the South Bay, was working on his house on the weekend and also had seen a series of, what he proceeded to describe, as the same type of lights and about the same time of the year. He described them as over San Francisco. So, if they were the same lights, We both, from different locations, saw them over San Francisco. He is a pilot, also.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Lights appeared to be satellites, but satellites are not usually seen at 4:30 PM, on a sunny day.  These objects blinked erratically, and would appear for a few minutes then disappear, then re-apppear at some other portion of the sky. Four of these objects approached each other and formed a diamond shape  three objects formed a straight line, the center object moved forward (forming a wedge) then the remaining two followed suit two objects moving on parallel tracks (but in opposite directions)  stopped when aligned then moved off in the same direction. An object would approach another,circle then move away in a different direction.  Some of these objects appeared to change and/or emit a red and blue colour (when seen through 10x50 binoculars).  All objects were viewed directly overhead.  7 witnesses, 5 adults, age range 28 to 48, two minors, aged 14 and 11.

While watching the meteor shower last night I observed two pale amber glowing lights traveling from southwest to northeast in a slightly weavy pattern. At the last they took a sharp right turn and were gone or lost in the lights from the city. If I were to look straight up at the sky this was slightly to the south and east. I'm in San Francisco. It was pretty clear but the lights from the city did obscure most stars nearing the horizon and as these approached that area I lost sight of them or they disappeared.

Satellite-like light in night sky making unexpected direction and speed changes;2004-09-05 22:00:00;15-20 sec;Satellite-like light in night sky making unexpected direction and speed changes I and my friend, both of us scientists working in biotech and quite sober at the time, were sitting outside on an unusually warm evening looking up at the stars. I noticed a moving light the shape and intensity of a small star, and at first concluded that it was a satellite since it initially had a velocity typical of satellites. However, to my surprise the light decelerated, and changed direction about 90 degrees for a certain distance. At this time I pointed the light out to my friend who witnessed the rest of the event with me. The light changed direction back again about 90 degrees so that it was more or less heading along its original trajectory (going north-to-south), and continued on and out of sight (unfortunately lots of light pollution in the city!).;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
UFO hiding in star constellation;2004-12-18 00:00:00;45 min;UFO hiding in star constellation Tonight we witnessed a ufo that appeared to have replaced a star (from the plough we think), it somehow hid one of the stars within this constellation and replaced it with the craft that basically from ground distance looked identical to the star - only it was moving within a designated perimeter and was moving with the earths orbit so that it didnt stray much from the constellation - so to the naked eye if you were walking or driving you would not see it. However we were in bed watching it with the lights out and it caught my eye. Then we proceeded to watch it for 45 mins until it ent out of view as it was moving with the star contstellation as mentioned. The ufo was moving eratically, a rythmn was hard to determine but smaller pins of light were evidently working with the main star shooting towards and away from it like a worker bee. The main star also formed a halo of light around it that built up of about 2 seconds then the halo would shoot out like a ripple in a pond. The experience was profound and has left us both very excited, they were without doubt using the star constellation as a disguise so not to attract too much atention. This moved far to eratically and quickly for a plane, heicopter, satallite - this was definate magnetic kind of movement as if being dragged along by a magnetic force. It was amazing!;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Tonights local new had a report on a sighting same night near the Sutro Tower, and they showed witness photos.... Freaky!  That was the direction I was looking at.

I am a 35 year old legal assistant and my girlfriend is a 25 year old waitress.  We went up to my roof on New Years Eve with the idea that we might catch the last of the celebratory fireworks going off in the downtown or marina area of San Francisco.  We saw a little bit of fireworks but not much.  We decided to say on the roof for a moment to enjoy the stars.  It had been cloudy and raining for days and having a clear sky was something special that night.  Suddenly we saw 3 or 4 glowing orange lights moving North almost directly overhead.  They were small, about the size of your thumbnail, and unblinking.  By definition, these were of course UFO's.  They were not like any other flying object either one of us had seen before.  We stayed in place on the roof watching the sky to see if anything else appeared and about 1 minute later we saw the same thing.  These were also travelling North.  Again, maybe 4 minutes later we saw a larger group headed North.  This time I remembered to count them.  There were 8 of them.  This time I was watching very intently to see if there was any movement that would show them to be using anti-gravity technology.  I was looking for any sudden sharp turns or accelerations.  There was one object that made a sudden change of course.  It had been traveling in a 3 o'clock position to an object then suddenly moved to a 6 o'clock position.  There is no way any known aircraft could have made that maneuver.  About 6 minutes after that we saw 2 more of the same lights traveling East.  We waited another  10 minutes then we began to get cold and went inside.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Two Bright Purple lights fly strangely through clouds over San Fransisco State University;2006-09-18 02:07:00;about a minute;Two Bright Purple lights fly strangely through clouds over San Fransisco State University I am a freshman at San Fransisco State University. I was lying in my bed on Sunday night (early Monday morning) around 2:07 a.m. when I turned my head around to look out the window (my bed is facing away from the window, but is right next to it), I started to notice that I could see some of the major stars that night which was rare. Because it is usually always cloudy here at State, but the last couple of days have been pretty clear sky and ok visibility at night which allowed me to only see the very bright stars in the sky... After looking for about a minute I saw these two lights in the distance that looked like planes at first, but became much similar in size and appearance as the stars around them. But these two objects were coming straight towards my direction (still very far away and high altitude). After flying side by side they satrted to cross paths simultaneously in kind of a figure-8 type motion. while moving very quickly, and traveling very fast.. they stopped in mid-air for about 2 seconds.. At this point, I thought it was just my eyes and maybe I had been sitting for too long. but I adjusted my eyesight, even moved closer and away from the window. I know what I saw.. It was so amazing.. Then the two lights faded into a purple-pinkish color and started moving and crossing paths again in a way that defined the laws of gravity. They would squiggle for a second, then they casually coasted through the clouds and started whisking away parallel with my window (still far away)..and as they flew away they would travel while continuously fly over eachother and then cross paths like they were joy-riding or something. it sounds weird, but it was quite beautiful, it was almost like they were dancing at one point, i was so excited and amazed by it. I followed them with my eyes as they zipped very quickly away into the clouds. There is no way this could have been any commercial or military aircraft because of its color, comlexity, speed, and it's very odd way of manuevering.. I had never ! seen a U FO in my life until now. I don't do drugs and I wasn't drunk. I just had to get my story out. I wanted to know if anyone else saw something similar to this in the San Fransisco Area on September 18 around 2:00 AM....;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

High speed and dacing lights in the southern sky.;2007-03-22 05:30:00;10 seconds;High speed and dacing lights in the southern sky. I was up early for work reasons just around 5:30 am. I was in my kitchen but had not turned on any lights yet. I was looking out the window and admiring a dark but clear morning with many stars and Jupiter plainly visible. My view was of the southern sky over San Francisco and the penninsula. I noticed a couple of jet airlines passing overhead and heard them faintly.  Still looking I noticed five or six smaller lights moving quickly from east to west in the same area of sky.  They moved in somewhat of a formation, that is they all seemed to be moving at the same speed but some of them changed position as they went and at such a speed that it almost looked like dancing lights.  I know of no aircraft that could so easily change position at such a high rate of speed.  I heard no noise from them and after they passed my positon I ran to the front of my house to see if I could continue to watch them but the bright street lights blotted out anything I might have been able to see.  The whole episode took approx 10 seconds.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Suddenly one of the stars shot vertically straight down and out of my line of sight, almost like a bullet.    Immediately afterward, a second star, which was very near the first one, shot to downward and diagonally to the right at about a 30 degree angle.  Both disappeared out of my line of sight, as if past the edge of the Earth.  I told my husband, who used to study astronomy, and I asked him whether comets move like that.  He said no.

Object with bright light above San Francisco accelerated towards my plane at impossible speed for a normal aircraft;2008-02-17 19:40:00;60-90 seconds;Object with bright light above San Francisco accelerated towards my plane at impossible speed for a normal aircraft On Sun Feb 17 2008 I was flying into SFO from Toronto on AC755. The time was about 10-15 minutes before our scheduled landing time of 7:52 PM, which would make it around 7:30-7:45 PM. We were flying over land that was spotted with some bodies of water. I was sitting on a window seat on the left side of the plane so I assume I was looking south. Here is a picture I found on the net that is similar to the view I had:  http://www.factionfive.com/blight/uploaded_images/DSC02804-771617.JPG. I would guess we were about 10,000 feet high, but perhaps someone more knowledgeable can estimate the height given the information above.  I was admiring the view when I noticed a light that was noticeably brighter than the other city lights coming from an object above a small body of water (like a small lake).  The shape appeared to be a sphere but I can't be sure as it was far away.  It was unusual enough to keep my attention. The light was a bright yellowish white but seemed to change to a bluish white and did not blink. It was moving very slowly so at first I thought it could be a helicopter. After observing it for about 30 seconds I felt it was not a helicopter and was definitely not a plane. What happened next is why I think it is worth reporting as a UFO the object started to accelerate at a geometric rate. It quickly sped up and flew up towards the plane and passed below and in front of us in about 2-3 seconds. If I had to guess, I would say the object was 15,000 feet away when I first saw it over the lake and it came within 2000 feet of the plane when it passed under and front of my view. I may have the absolute distances wrong but the relative distance (2000:15000) is about correct.  The point is the object appeared to accelerate from almost nothing to beyond 1000 mph in about 2 seconds.  It happened so quickly and I was in disbelief by what I saw. I looked around at the other passengers hoping that someone else saw it but no one appeared to have. I recall a red glow on the lower half of the object but I am not confident about this particular detail (this happened over 3 months ago) but the rest I am confident of what I saw. I have never reported a UFO before. I would like to know if anyone else saw this.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Bright red luminous round light seen moving slowly over SF Bay.;2008-05-07 22:00:00;15 minutes;Bright red luminous round light seen moving slowly over SF Bay. We would like to report seeing a bright red luminous light in the sky over SF Bay last night about 10 pm.   We watched it for about 15 minutes as it moved slowly across the sky and were able to get about 2 1/2 minutes of video of it.  We saw a bright red luminous light much brighter and larger than  a star moving extremely slow across the Bay.  When we first noticed the light from our workshop at Hunter's Point Shipyard it was stationary over the SF Bay between SF and Oakland.   It was a very bright red light that didn't blink on and off.  It stayed the same intensity of red the entire sighting until a jet plane flew near it at which point it blinked completely out.  A second later it reappeared but at a much less intensity of brightness.  It blinked completely out again then reappeared a second time even less intensely for an instant then blinked out again and never reappeared.

bright light shot down toward ground;2008-12-13 23:15:00;1 sec.;bright light shot down toward ground On december 13th, 2008 at around 11:15 pm (pacific coast time) in san francisco California, i was drinving with my girlfriend and my two friends sitting in the backseat. i was driving of the freeway and we were all pretty quiet listening to music with low volume. i was driving of the freeway looking at the road ahead of me.  All of a sudden i saw an extremely bright light in the sky ahead of me all of a sudden shooting down diagonally extremely fast. to me it seemed like it was a white dot of light that all of a sudden popped out of the sky and immediately shot down towards the ground. i could not see where excatly it landed or anything because it shot down and went behind this hill hill in the distance. When i first saw it my first insticnt was that it was like maybe  firework but i quickly realized that it could not be because fireworks go up, then i thought maybe it was some sort of missle but i dont think that i would not have seem something as bright as that coming from higher up in the sky because i just saw it pop out of nowhere. then i started to think. after around 30 seconds i said wait hold on.. did u guys see that??? and immediatelly my girlfriend said yeah, what was it? then i said i dont know what did you see  and according to her she saw a bright white line coming from the sky diagonally but she says she only saw it with her perifiral vision. i assume that it was a bright dot that was moving so fast that it seemed like a line coming down diaginally in a perfecly straight line. i knew that it could not be lightning because when i got out of the car i looked up at the sky and saw that it was a very clear night without a cloud in sight. also it could not have been lightning becuase it was way to bright. and also lightning comes down straight to the ground  but this came down diagonally  and in a straight line. I know that it was not a shooting star either becuase i have seen many and this was way brighter and bigger than a star and faster. after that we were all pretty s! cared an d confused.

White orb turned pink, then red, then faded out as it moved across the sky.;2009-01-16 18:30:00;30 sec;White orb turned pink, then red, then faded out as it moved across the sky. I'm a 31 year old Art Director with a wife and child. I was outside around 6:30-7:00pm on Friday after work playing with my dog, and b/c I live 5 minutes from the airport I happened to be looking up at all the airplanes in the sky. I noted just before the incident about what a clear night it was and how you could see almost all the stars. As I watched one plane that happened to be pretty low probably having just taken off and banking in a southern direction going just under my clear view of a very bright Venus I looked down at my dog. When I looked back up to find the plane to see which direction it was heading in, I noticed a single white light moving from the south to the north. It struck me as odd b/c I could see about 7 planes in the sky at one time from my vantage point and I noticed that all the planes in the sky had at a minimum of 2-4 lights on, and at least 1-2 flashing lights. I watched the single white light move north at a somewhat medium pace, wasn't fast, wasn't slow. As it got closer the single light started to turn pink, then changed to red then completely faded out. After I saw that I assumed that the object, presumably a plane, probably banked to the side and the light was hidden by a wing. So I sat outside for 10 minutes and watched the sky in the general area where the object was heading. I never saw a light appear in the area. I still saw several planes in the area, all with multiple light, and flashing lights. I also remembered to recheck the sky conditions for possible clouds... not a single cloud in the sky. I'm a natural born skeptic, so this is strange for me. I was so baffled by this, that I told my wife and of course she laughed and told me I was crazy.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

What looked like a star high in the sky over San Francisco slowly moved then stopped then faded away;2009-03-20 23:00:00;3-4 mins;What looked like a star high in the sky over San Francisco slowly moved then stopped then faded away In San Francisco, CA, on Thursday night, March 20th at around 11:00 pm, I noticed what looked like 2 stars close together at about the same magnitude of light high in the northwest sky.   I guess my peripheral vision detected a slight movement so I continued to look at the 2 stars.  Soon I realized that the right light was actually moving east very slowly.  Its light was a distinct muted red, definitely a different red from Mars.  If I were to measure the distance of travel at arm’s length it moved about 8-9 inches in the night sky.  It moved to the east for about 2 minutes and then stopped, soon after it just stayed in one position and after 30 seconds or so it began to slowly and steadily fade away until it was completely gone as if it were leaving Earth’s atmosphere.  It took about a minute to completely vanish. I know what it wasn’t.  It was not a satellite, airplane, jet, helicopter, weather balloon, Chinese floating lantern or anything else that I have seen before.  I do not know what it was.  I would love to understand what I saw.  I feel very lucky to have witnessed this event.  I keep asking myself, what the hell was it that I saw?!  I am curious to know if any other folks saw what I saw in the San Francisco sky.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Abnormal Movement of Unknown Object;2010-09-28 21:00:00;hour/hour half;Abnormal Movement of Unknown Object The object approached out to the west the color was red and white at all times the object color was red and white the object sort of resembled a star that is how small it was.  After approaching from the west it stopped for a time see ref #1  The object then proceeded to move south see ref #2 in which it moved right to left and also in a circular motion at all times it should be mentioned the object used the same motions stop, move either left to right and in a circular motion.  The object was observed against a ship light for reference to make sure the object was moving also the star before the big dipper juts-up the star which is not part of the big dipper in the handle was also used for reference.  The object proceeded to move north past the ship light see Ref #3 which the ship light for the whole time to this period was fixed after the object moved to the right of the very bright ship light the ship started moving due south ref #4.  At this time I cut a hole into a piece of paper and secured it placing my face at least 6 inches away from the hole to double check to see again if it was my eyes playing tricks, but the object was moving as mentioned above moving out of the range of the cutout.  One note at no time did the object move north of the last star in the handle of the big dipper as if it was a boundary.  Also the object seemed to move west at one time to chase a very faint light south to north moving like a strobe on a aircraft which one could barely make out the light it was so dim.  You almost had to catch it out of the corner of your eye.  Ref #5 and #6 leaving the coastal position after about a hour or hour and a half I was beyond the tree line when the object came closer and was brighter than before it moved very rapidly form right to left (north to south) and then back north disappearing behind the trees.  I then spotted somebody with a very bright flashlight as though they were searching for somebody. ! end of encounter.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Multiple lights over Ocean Beach;2010-10-13 21:00:00;3-4 minutes;Multiple lights over Ocean Beach Sorry this is so long- this was such a strange experience and the details remain vivid to this day. Noticed about 3 or 4 spheres, glowing orange, over Ocean Beach.   First thought it was fireworks (a lot of people set them off at this beach), then thought it may have been fishing boats but the orange spheres rose up slightly and hovered for several seconds (felt like minutes) very un-boat-like.  Saw 2 or 3 more orange light spheres rise up in the air.    Third thought was weather balloons, or maybe glowing kites, but then the spheres rose up higher, some faster than the others, all moving up but not in a uniform direction.   The spheres then moved south towards Pacifica and disappeared.  Never seen anything like this and couldn’t find any reference online mysterious lights lights over Ocean Beach etc, to what I saw.  Finally found these postings and am so glad someone else saw this too.  Overall sighting lasted maybe three or four minutes- a long time. The other post mentions being over by 24th St which is high on a hill but far from Golden Gate Park/Ocean Beach.  They saw three but I think it was due to the distance I was much closer and the lights were closer to the ground, also lots of tall houses/buildings in that area. No particular background for me, other than I believe in UFOs and that we aren't alone in this universe. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They looked like they were going to collide by the angles they were moving in.  Right before they did, a third glowing object came in from the side.  Right before they all hit each other, all three shot straight upward and disappeared.  The two that were falling together did a close to 180 degree turn and the third glowing object probably turned at a 50-60 degree angle. It's hard to gauge how far away they were so it could have been anywhere over northern California. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

6-8 pinkish-red starlike objects sighted in San Francisco, California sky;2012-01-21 18:57:00;4 minutes;6-8 pinkish-red starlike objects sighted in San Francisco, California sky Just before 7p.m. Pacific Standard Time on January 20, 2012, I witnessed a succession (6-8) of several pinkish-red starlike objects moving steadily through the sky of San Francisco, California.  I was in the middle of the city, walking east, when I glanced north and saw the objects moving from the northwest (seemingly coming from over the Pacific Ocean), and moving to the east (or slightly southeast).  I could not see their full passage through the sky, as part of it was blocked by neighborhood buildings (they were not extremely far above the horizon, and my view of them could be obstructed by three-story building across the street from where I was). The objects were not making any sound that was audible from where I was walking. Relative to a star or planet in the night sky, the objects were about the same size or slightly bigger than the planet Jupiter.  They twinkled slightly, as stars do, and did not emit a pattern of blinks.  The air was steady (no wind) and the sky was clear. As the objects moved inland, they gradually faded into the distance until no longer visible.  They moved at about the speed of a commercial jet through the sky, if not slightly faster.  They did not leave trails, and were distinct objects, moving from left to right, rather than vertically or at an angle, as shooting stars or space debris passing through the Earth’s atmosphere. I did not notice a distinct formation in which they were moving, except that they were all moving in the same direction and disappeared in approximately the same area.  They were not traveling in a line, but were rather staggered in elevation, and moving at the same pace. I pointed the last one I saw out to someone else who was outdoors at the time. I went out twice later in the evening, and did not see similar objects again.

Flashing lights in the sky at night in sf;2013-05-07 01:40:00;2 seconds;flashing lights in the sky at night in sf I was in bed on my phone about to sleep with the lights off after a night of writing a paper.  The window shades are wide opened because I like waking up to sunlight.  From my peripheral, I notice lights moving across the sky.  I turn to look at it and thought it was just a plane. It was brightly flashing white, blue and red lights so maybe the police.  Even that would be a first because I've never seen a police helicopter at night in the area of SF I live in.  But then after watching it for literally a second or two the lights just vanish.  I wait and nothing.  Looked at where it is suppose to be based on how fast it was moving but I didnt see it again. I know how planes would usually have flashing lights too but I have  never seen any simply disappear.  It's a fairly cloudy night and I would've seen the intensity of the lights diminish if it went further away or behind clouds.  My skin was covered in goosebumps when it was simply gone.   I dont know what I saw but I ! saw it.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

It had no flashing lights.   Much lower in the sky an airplane was passing simultaneously whose lights and flashing lights could be seen.  The plane could be heard, but was slightly behind the glowing object which had passed first and silently.   It was very large and I suppose it could have been the international Space Station if it was passing over San Francisco at that time, otherwise I cannot image what it could have been.  I just looked at the ISS tracker and it is considerably to the south of our location along the equator and did not pass overhead in San Francisco in this last orbit.

A group of tiny fiery red star-sized lights.;2013-12-31 23:55:00;3 minutes;A group of tiny fiery red star-sized lights. I go on nightly walks to look at stars from the top of the hill I live near.  Tonight as I was admiring the clear night and getting ready for NYE cheers echoing the city, I noticed there were 3-4 of these tiny little fireballs that looked the same size as most stars and especially similar in color to the planet Mars but a brighter lumens than the planet.  Their color was flaming and flickering, whilst they glided in a diagonal-like ascension.  One by one they were out of sight, gliding slowly until they disappeared.  It was hard to see how far they were from me, but they looked like they were quite far up in the sky, thus their size was so tiny.  I've never seen anything like them before, and I assume there could have been more before I got to that viewpoint and started my gazing...I skygaze at the night sky quite a bit, and have never seen anything like these before.  It made me feel both calm and curious, I didn't feel a threat just a sort of inner peace and surreal amazement.   Our elevation in San Francisco is at sea level, so not sure what these may have looked like from higher altitudes.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
