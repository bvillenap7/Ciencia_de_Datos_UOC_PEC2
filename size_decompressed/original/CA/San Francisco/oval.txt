It felt as if we were being observed, at first I thought it was a star, but it didn't twinkle or flicker. Then after watching it for a few minutes and commenting on it, it began to move in what was a zig zag pattern upward in to the sky and then all of a sudden it disappeared and what was left as it disappeared was a silowette of a oval like shape as a faint outline before it completey dissappeared from site. It moves very fast in a ziz zag pattern or zzzzzz pattern. The color was a white light.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

As we flew from sanfran the normal turn is to the north over the city and then over oakland. just as we reached about 4500 foot the plane was forced into a hard left turn in which the food carts came loose and the overheads came open.  my shoes which were off slid accross the isle. Being in first calss I could see the panic in the eyes of the flight attendents.  Then two large ovals craft went past the right side of the plane and above us. They were much larger than our craft the first being nickel in color and the second a rust color. They were close enough to see with detail their shape and construction. Then a third craft nickel came by on the same path as the first two.I was in the window seat but the person next to me and those behind on the right side of the flight saw them.  The flight attendant tried to get the attention of the flight crew but it was some time,three or four minutes befour the crew would take their call.  There was a heated conversation and the attendants became very distrssed and talked among themeselves. The cockpit door then came open and the crew told the attendants be calm all the while one person on the crew was on the radio looking for a new flight path and seeking information on the other objects we just missed.  the door remained open and I could here conversation as how how they would fly a new route to Dallas. Later the crew all denied anything varied from the norm  and would not discuss this matter.  ON a later flight I was with the same attendtent and was reconized and was asked if I had seen them and she said we were very lucky. I have all the flight info if anyone wants to follow up.  I also have photos of a craft that I took from a flight from New Mexico that was below us. This craft had triangle shape and moved from side to side as it moved to the north at a very slow speed.We saw the craft long enough for me to get my nikon from my case and take photos.  The Dr next to me kept the object in view as I got the camera  out. It looked very unstable in movement. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, although witness is attempting to establish the correct date.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter   Thank you for the responce.   The date is incorrect but it was within a few months.  There was an airshow scheduled for that weekend in SF, as info was in the news I read prior to the flight.  I can go back through my records and get the exact date if needed.  I mean there was activity brought on by the occurrense taking place with the crew and others on the flight that took place for over one hour.  this includes the crew trying to get an ok to fly over parts of Nevada  that were not normal for the flight.  With the door open to the cabin for a period of time you could overhear the conversations taking place.  Also the attendants spoke of this to each other, about the flight being too far south of norm. Actual viewing time was short because of proximity of the three craft, at the most a few seconds.  There were no more than 1200 ft away at the most and details in the surface was obvious.  They  all had weatherbeaten look and looked very as if they had been exposed to harsh conditions. Give me a fax number and I will send a drawing of the craft.  When this started I was on the right side of the aircraft but swiched to the left window after our turn to the left and could see all three over the bay bridge moving northeast and gaining altitude and speed. they maintained this course until out of sight.

2 small (about 1 ft. long & 200 ft. away at closest) dark objects circling each other then sped south,followed min. later by 2 more.;1997-03-05 18:10:00;2 minutes;Summary : 2 small (about 1 ft. long & 200 ft. away at closest) dark objects circling each other then sped south,followed min. later by 2 more. Clear sky, not windy, facing west from roof of three story building during smoke break,saw two dark, slightly oblong objects (but evenly unlike a ballon that has one roundedside and one narrow side) caught my eye as they manuevered about each other about 200or more feet away.  The movements were smooth and not jerky or bobbing (like balloonswould do) then sped off to the south faster than any wind might propell them.  I waswishing I had a pair of binoculars as they grew smaller above a building to the south.When I first saw them circling each other it appeared almost as if they were linked bya tether since they moved in tandem, but then when their path became straight they seemedto be at a greater distance appart than if this were the case.  Strangely, a dark heli-copter was circling the area directly above the closest approach of the objects at the time.It performed a pretty tight loop that seemed to focus on the area and was quite low as well.I looked up at it only two or three times and didn't notice any markings.  It didn't strikeme as a traffic helicopter and was in the wrong location if it were so if they were doingtheir job.  After the sighting I pondered whether what I saw were ballons, but this possibilityjust didn't seem to fit.  I didn't notice any wind that could account for it and the windusually comes from the west off the coast.  These objects flew from north to south.  Asmentioned in the abreviated report, the first two objects were followed by two more on thesame path, but without any circling maneuvers.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

It did not move and even though it was small I sill could make out an oval shape. I looked through binoculars and saw that it was eliptical and had a hole in the middle.

When 30 minutes later it wasn't moving, I looked through binoculars and see a hovering object with red twinkling lights that is not moving.  It is large and hovering looking towards north westernly direction.  It appears to be a space craft.  I called people but it is late and cold out.  I'll try to get witnesses.  It is above the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco from where I am in the center of San Francisco;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

I always thought it would be really cool to see a ufo, I have always been nutral on the subject neither believing or dis-believing their existance but instead of being cool it was rather a little traumatic, whenever I think about it I can see the whole thing like it was yesterday I remember every detail and I know I will never forget what I saw.

Dark oval object photographed over San Francisco;2004-09-20 09:30:00;photo;Dark oval object photographed over San Francisco I was cleaning the lens of my camera. I was trying to clean off a very small smudge mark on the lense, so I took my camera outside, pointed it straight up into the clear blue sky where there was nothing , and snapped 2 random shots, 2 seconds apart, in the exact same place in the sky so I could then take my camera back into my office and look at the photographs to see if the smudge marks were gone. They were, but in looking closely at the photographs to see if the smudge was gone, I noticed a small dark speck at the top of the first photo. This is a 6 million pixel high-res digital camera and I zoomed in on the object. Upon doing so, It became clear that this was some kind of flying object, sort of an oval in shape, and by the amount of deep zooming I did, appeared to be very large. The second photo showed nothing but empty space. I have the photo if anyone wants a copy, your guess is as good as mine as to what this thing was. I have also emailed this photograph to ufocntr@nwlink.com;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

4 UFOs over the Sunset District in San Francisco CA on 6/14/09 around 9:00 pm.;2009-06-14 21:00:00;10minutes;4 UFOs over the Sunset District in San Francisco CA on 6/14/09 around 9:00pm This evening just as the sun was beginning to set I saw what I thought were two planes heading from northwest moving in a southeast direction toward me.  I was standing at my living room window in the Sunset District of San Francisco watching the sunset over the ocean when I saw them.  As they approached I questioned if in fact they were planes. They were absolutely quite.  It seemed one was following the other.  They moved in a straight line almost directly toward me.  One got close enough that I could see four lights, one red, one yellow and 2 white lights.  The lights were pulsating.  Then I moved to my bedroom window trying to get a better view.  They were both still there after I transitioned rooms.  My bedroom window also has an ocean view looking west but is more south than my living room window. Then it seemed they were out of view so I went to my back decks on the east side of my building and saw them again.  They were still heading southeast and seemed to be heading toward a third object that looked like a star.  At the closest the larger one seemed the size of an eraser on a pencil. Then a fourth one came from the southwest and seemed to be heading north not following the others.  That one was quite big also, in that it was just over the rooftops and could not have been a star in that case. It also had 4 pulsating lights red, yellow and 2 white lights. It seemed a bit closer than the other two that seemed to pass overhead of the building I was in. All in all it felt like I watched for a good 10 to 15 minutes.  There was no sound at all and no trails of any sort.  I was not able to see any of them by the time the sun set. What did I see?  Today is 6/14/09.  It is now 10:14pm.  This sighting occurred as the sun set. It was quite a beautiful sunset in a clear sky after a warm clear day.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
oval gray flying saucer;2010-05-22 20:15:00;1min;oval gray flying saucer An oval flying object (gray, about 10m in diameter) flew over San francisco.  It was traveling from West to East. I started seeing if above UCSF and ended, I guess, somewhere above the Bay.  The flight was not very stable (oscillating on its axis) but was flying very fast.  It was faster than planes taking off from SFO which can be seen from our place.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Five lights over San Francisco fade away high over head NYE.;2012-12-31 00:00:00;2 minutes;Five lights over San Francisco fade away high over head NYE. I was getting off work a few minutes before the New Year. I walked outside of the station.  The night was cold with some clouds, but clearing.  Three light were high in sky flying north one behind the other about mile.  The lights were white light with a red light in the center.  They were a little brighter than an aircraft that high in the sky, and moving about the same speed as an aircraft that high. (Over 10,000ft.) I noticed two more of the same, but out to the west, like out over the ocean. A co-worker pulled into the station, I pointed out the lights to him. He looked up and said, What? That red light? As the lights got over head, All five faded off the lights at the same time.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Strange types of UFO's over San Francisco;2019-09-14 16:00:00;5 minutes;Strange types of UFO's over San Francisco While walking downtown San Francisco, my wife noticed a bright sphere over a building, after pointing it out, we noticed another sphere over a different building.  My wife had her phone in her hand and took two photos seconds apart the spheres were moving,  After looking at the photo, we were surprised to see three additional oval UFO’s (nearly transparent) near the spheres, one of the oval UFO’s looks like it has landed on top of a building.  Looking back up we were unable to see the transparent UFO’s with our naked eye, but they are visible by photo.  The two spheres moved away and out of our view.  Very strange.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
