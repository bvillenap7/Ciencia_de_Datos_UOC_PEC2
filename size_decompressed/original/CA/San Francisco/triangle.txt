Boomerang Shaped Objects w/ dark & light color scheme;1996-10-06 13:00:00;30 min;Boomerang Shaped Objects w/ dark & light color scheme It was a sunny Sunday afternoon and we (4 of us) were watching football in my friend's 2nd floor apartment in the Richmond Dist.  I spotted two men on the street below looking upwards and pointing.  We all thought they were looking up at one of the windows in the apartment building across the street.  My buddy yelled down to them what are you looking at you perverts.  They looked up and shouted back wholly shit....do you see it too?.   They were both almost hysterical. One of the men had a small eye piece he was looking through.  He tossed it up to us so we could see for ourselves.  There was a boomerang shaped craft way up in the sky.  It remained motionless as white puffy clouds were passing underneath. You could barely see it without the eyepiece. Then one of the guys said look, there's more.  Sure enough we could see 2 then 3....I counted 4 total.  All the same shape hovering close to one another.  They all seemed to have the same segmented color scheme. A dark band followed by a light color band followed by another dark band.  Kind of like a bumble bee.  We all went out onto the street and continued watching the craft. No one had a camera so we began stopping people on the street and pointing out the objects to them. I guess this was an attempt to prove to ourselves we weren't crazy or seeing things.   After a while of watching & telling people, it was weird, there was nothing else we could do.  Eventually we went back up stairs and I continued looking back up in the sky to see if they were still hovering. I looked up the last time and they were gone.  We never saw them zoom off...they just disappeared.  I found this site while surfing the new google video search engine. When I did a search by date and saw a similar sighting on the same day in NY I had to post this.  This was very real!  It was in broad daylight on a clear day and the objects were seen by several people.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Encountered large triangular object while night fishing off Farlon Island and fired 100 rounds of 22 ammo at it.;2000-01-30 23:15:00;:15;Encountered large triangular object while night fishing off Farlon Island and fired 100 rounds of 22 ammo at it. On the evening of Super Bowl Sunday, I was hauling up a line of crab traps off Farlon Island with my dog aboard our 25' boat. While leaning over the side, my dog started to bark furiously. I looked up and saw a huge triangular object hovering above with NO sound. I was hit by a beam of white light and fell backward onto the sole of the cabin. I grabbed my Ruger 10-22 rifle loaded with a 100 round banana magazine and stared firing as fast as I could until the clif was empty. I was able to shoot out the light. While grabbing for a second clip, I saw a hatch open up on the bottom side of the object and two people leaned down to yell STOP SHOOTING AS US YOU IDIOT. The only other noise I heard was a hissing sound like air escapeing from a flat tire or something. As the object move off to the south, I saw a helocopter come out off the top and move in next to my boat about 20' off the water and 50' way. Someone in the side door held up a camera and flash off a picture of me in the boat holding the rifle. The helocopter made no noise and had no markings on it. It was solid flat black as was the huge Triangle. The chopper then took off toward the Golden Gate bridge climbing up. The Triangle slowing gained altitude and was last seen heading south. I left the area for port and went out Wednesday to finish hauling in my traps. At first I thought it was an alien UFO and was genunly startled by it. However, I now believe it was an experimental military platform for transporting a small fleet of black helocopters that leave and enter out of the top of a huge silent floating triangle the size of a football field. A rigid airship if you will. ((NUFORC Note:  This may be the first report we have received that has the occupants of such a craft using a camera with a flash attachment..));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

I saw a bright green triangle object fly by a living room bay window.  The condo is on a hill and we were on the third floor.  Very little fog that night for San Francisco.  As the object flew by, it made a flash by the window.  My boyfriend only saw the flash in his peripheral vision, as he was not facing the window.  I saw a green triangle object fly past at tremendous speed.  I could not see where it went because it disappeared so fast. The object was very much a triangle and did not glow like a meteor, but the surrounding flash lit the object.  It was a solid object from my observation.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Triangle craft over ocean beach in san francisco;2002-11-27 12:30:00;1 minute;Triangle craft over ocean beach in san francisco Day after Thanksgiving 2002 I was walking on Ocean Beach and happened to look up at the sky- I walk this stretch of the ocean frequently as I've lived across the street since 1996- I know what planes & helicopters look like and this was definitely some other sort of craft. I saw it up there, toward the cliff house- it was silver with some spikes sticking out, jutting out of two of its sides- like black poles which were sticking up. It also seemed to have a tail at one end- kind of like a stalk stem of a mushroom. I looked around me to see if anyone else was seeing it. I stopped and tried to see if I could flag someone down to look, too. I kept thinking, God, is that a UFO? There was noone likely to stop, it somehow didn't seem appropriate and the beach wasn't that crowded. It was sunny, clear, I know what I saw and it was very weird. Anyway, the even weirder thing is is how I actually felt looking at it- extremely serene and calm it was almost like whoever was in charge of it or actually in it wanted me to see it. It lasted a long time, about 1 minute. I remember thinking, This is like on Art Bell. I've neevr felt whatever it was I was feeling before or since when I saw it. I also rwemember thinking, What's gong to happen?  I kept my eye on it and next thing I knew it was gone. One second there, the next, out. It was a ways up in the sky- you'd need to be looking at that patch of sky to see it or be looking at that general area and then maybe it would get your attention. Like I said, I'm used to looking at that area of the sky on walks-. I told someone I know & he said it sounds like a secret military craft- I can't recall the word he used but it sounded right- some sort of very light craft. Thanks;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

self-illuminated triangle-shaped craft flying in v formation;2004-06-13 23:00:00;5 to 10 minutes;self-illuminated triangle-shaped craft flying in v formation I was sittting in my backyard smoking a cigarette meanwhile looking up to the north star. I then became aware of 5 self-illuminated triangular (maybe diamond-shaped) craft flying in a V formation to the east of the north star. There was a sixth craft of the same shape and size flying outside the formation but moving at the same speed and direction. This sixth craft seemed to be leading the others as it moved its position relative to the others occasionally (maybe to signal a change in course). The formation of crafts were traveling west and moved quite rapidly. Although I heard no sound the crafts were fairly high in the sky. The color of the illumination was transluscent yellow-orange.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Two large Triangle shaped objects that flew over San Francisco Bay Area near Mt. Davidson;2005-12-03 18:45:00;15-20 seconds;Two large Triangle shaped objects that flew over San Francisco Bay Area near Mt. Davidson At around 6:45 PM on December 3, 2005, a friend and I were outside on our back deck looking to the crystal clear night sky facing west when we saw two large black triangle shaped objects move slowly and at a low altitude (500-1000 feet) directly over our house from the north west Mt. Davidson area to the south east.  We live in San Francisco on the south east side of Mt. Davidson at the cross street of Terasita and Los Palmos in Miraloma Park.  The two distinct objects that we observed were flying in side by side formation and appeared to moving as one.  Both craft were perfect equilateral triangles with pulsating dim star like lights on each tip of the two triangles, six lights in total.  These were most definitely two solid black large triangle shaped objects which from underneath appeared to be much darker than the night sky as they passed in front other stars in the night sky and were darker than they night sky with no moon.  The objects were very well cloaked (best way to describe it) against the background of the night sky and could have easily been mistaken as constellations but they were moving slowly which is what caught our attention.  The entire sighting lasted for approximately 30-45 seconds.  The objects did not appear to change speed, direction or altitude and moved slowly together overhead until they dimmed out of sight near the south side San Francisco crossing over 280 onto the north west of the San Bruno mountain range.   I have been an amateur astronomer for over twenty five years now and I can say with conviction that these were definitely Not planes, satellites, blimps, helicopters, the International Space Station, meteorites or fire balls.  They were two solid triangle shaped objects that move in perfect formation together and made absolutely no noise as traveled directly over head.  The two craft were identical in size and were significantly larger than a 747.  The weather conditions in San Francisco last night crystal clear and ideal for sky watching.  The crescent moon had also just dropped below the south western horizon about 15 minutes prior before we witnessed this once in a life time sighting.  We were both truly shocked by what we had just seen to the extent that we felt it necessary to call into two local TV stations (CBS 5 & KGO 7) to report what we witnessed.  I am in my late thirties and the other person in their earlyy 40s.  We both have always been rather skeptical of alien spacecraft visiting Earth simply given the vast distances between stars and the time required to travel such a distance without bending space/time.  But having just what we say with our own two eyes list night, we can now say with absolute conviction that they were highly advanced craft that ones gut feeling tells them to be 'other worldly'.  Nither of us had been drinking nor were we in any other altered mental state of consciousness at the time of the sighting.  If anyone else saw any strange objects lights in the Bay Area night sky last night please feel free to contact me.  I consider this experience one of the most amazing events of my lifetime that I cannot refute.  Weather the objects were deeply classified military X-Project space craft or Alien cannot be proven (yet) but the objects had an eerie feeling to them in the way that they moved together and at the angle the triangles were positioned in flight.  The profound impact of this event will forever change how I look at humanity and that such highly advanced technology does exists regardless of its origin.  I have not heard anyone else reporting what we saw last night in the media or on the internet but hopefully other people in the Bay Area witnessed the same event.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
black triangles were seen flying across the surface of the full moon;2006-10-10 05:00:00;10 minutes;black triangles were seen flying across the surface of the full moon I was looking at the full moon through my telescope (Mead-Model 70AZ-AR)when I saw a small black triangle fly from left to right horizontally across the face of the moon.  It lasted about two seconds and once the triangle passed the lighted moon surface, I couldn't see it anymore. It looked, from what I could see, to be just a dark black surface- no lights on the object but with clear lines defining its triangle shape against the lighted surface of the moon.  About 5 minutes later another black triangle moved over the moon's surface from bottom to top.  This second black triangle moved much quicker, about a second or less, with the same black surface and clear lines.  Approximately 3 minutes later, another black object moved diagonally across the upper left hand side of moon's surface from left to right, very quickly, faster than the first two objects.  The third object was moving so fast that it looked to be more like a sphere, but with the same deep black color.  It was the color that I could clearly see against the moons surface.  All three objects had clear lines against the backdrop of the moon and dissapeared once they had passed the moons surface.  The first two objects had a clear delineated shape of a triangle against the moon's surface.  The third object was more of a definate color, a deep black against the moon, but not having as clear of a shape as the first two, due to its' was moving so fast.  The first two objects were the same size, the third looked a little smaller. I am currently a graduate student in psychology.  I couldn't sleep that night-but I was awake and lucid. I had been up around that time for the past three days writing papers.  I had gotten used to being up and awake around that time, so I wasn't surprised that I was awake.  It takes me a couple of days to get back to sleeping normally after I finish a big project.  Since I was up, I decided to take out my telescope and enjoy the full moon.  I had been looking at the moon, trying different lenses, trying to find different landmarks for about 10 minutes or so when I saw the first black triangle.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

UPDATED REPORT - PLEASE UPDATE PREVIOUS REPORT - THX - Triangle of lights flies over San Francisco;2007-09-14 22:20:00;7 seconds;Triangle of lights flies over San Francisco I was on 3rd Ave between Clement and California St. in the Richmond District of San Francisco when I saw three lights overhead in a nearly equilateral triangle formation traveling west rapidly without making a sound. The lights were of equal brightness. They were not as bright as the lights of an airplane and were approximately the color and brightness of bright stars. If I remember correctly, they were white with a slightly blue tint. The lights traveled over the city from slightly north of my position to directly west of my position. At its closest, the triangle appeared to be twice the size of a full moon.  It took approximately seven seconds for the triangle to travel into the distance when I lost sight of it near the tops of the houses on the west side of the avenue. (I was standing on the sidewalk of the east side of the avenue.) The triangle appeared to tilt slightly as it traveled into the distance. There were two airplanes in the area at the time. One was to the southwest and one was to the northwest. Their lights were considerably brighter and one airplane was loud. They crossed the sky at a much slower pace and with noise. After I lost sight of the unusual lights, I wondered if they had slightly changed formation near the end of my sighting or if the appearance of such a change was the result of the change in my perspective.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
3 bright lights in triangle pattern stationary over SF Bay;2008-02-16 18:15:00;20 seconds;3 bright lights in triangle pattern stationary over SF Bay February 16th at 6:15 pm while driving towards San Francisco on Highway 280, 3 unconnected bright lights in a triangular pattern on my right caught my attention. By my estimate they seemed to be on the other side of the bay in the direction of Oakland. Having grown up next to the SF Airport I knew right away they did not look like the lights from any plane I have ever seen before. Looking back and forth from the road to the lights I noticed they were not moving. I watched them for approx. 20 seconds. After another glance they disappeared. I had a clear view of the sky but were unable to see the lights anywhere. The sky that evening was just starting to become overcast.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Triangular formation of dim lights spotted moving smoothly across San Francisco night sky.;2008-09-23 00:15:00;25 Seconds;Triangular formation of dim lights spotted moving smoothly across San Francisco night sky. We were walking North on Baker St from our van which was parked on the west side of Baker St, between Fulton and McAllister Streets. The night was a clear night with a good view of the stars. The person I was with was standing near the corner of McAllister and Baker streets and observed what we at first thought was a plane.  She pointed it out to me - I was standing about 15 feet south of her - and I looked up and saw 3 dim points of light (about the brightness of a dim star) that formed an equilateral triangle, moving quickly in smooth, straight line north/northeast.  At first we thought this might be a plane but considering that the craft appeared to be silent, and that the lights were a decent distance from one another it does not match the description of any plane that either of us has ever seen.  the craft moved smoothly out of sight and we ran uphill to try and continue observing it but were unable to.  For what it is worth, I grew up in a town that was home to a Navy Air Station and was within the flight path for a major international airport and did not recognize the lights we saw as being consistent with any plane or helicopter that I've ever seen.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Dim Orange;2008-11-14 23:41:00;1 minute;I was on my roof deck admiring the beautiful night. All of a sudden I saw a strange light formation move across the sky. It was a V like object, similar in shape to a formation of flying birds that appeared for about 30 secs and moved steadily across the sky. It traveled in North Easterly direction, passing from Orion belt, under the moon toward Orion's head. It didn't appear to be a solid object (like the point of a plane) but was rather like a collection of dim orange lights. It made no noise. It is very difficult to describe its size or how high in the sky it was but it seems like it was as high as the stars and was, very roughly, about the size of 2 Orion's belts in a V shape. What we saw seems amazing similar to this report: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53154.html;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
It had a TRANGULAR SHAPE, was DARK GRAY (lit by the moon light) with 3 ROUND CIRCLES ON IT'S BOTTOM;2008-11-15 19:55:00;7 seconds;It had a TRANGULAR SHAPE, was DARK GRAY (lit by the moon light) with 3 ROUND CIRCLES ON IT'S BOTTOM This current sighting, seen Saturday night on 11/15/08 at 7:55pm was a flying object over the moon lit night sky of San Francisco, California’s outer sunset district near my home. ABOUT ME: I am a retired electronics Eng, 59 and working part time. I also have a FAA Private Pilot License and I am a backyard amateur A. I own a 12-inch reflector and a 6-inch refractor. On this night we were experiencing a warm front over the S.F. Bay Area. 20 degrees above normal for this time of year. The moon was ¾ full and just visible over the eastern horizon. Because of the moon lit sky (the suns light reflecting off the moon of course), birds were easily seen flying overhead at higher altitudes. THE SIGHTING: I was sitting on a backyard recliner drinking ice water using a  8 x 40 quality binocular to star qaize. My eyes were night adapted and just a few seconds before seeing the UFO, I was looking at the constellation Pegasus, I drifted my binoculars upward to look at a nebula when I saw what looked like a large black bird or object flying where my binocular was pointing. I thought how strange the shape as it did not have a bird shape. I continued to look into the binocular and followed this dark object heading 180 degrees south in a straight line. It was almost overhead, maybe within a ½ mile east of my home. It was flying with NO LIGHTS and NO SOUND. I live with 15 miles of SFO airport and see many planes turning and overhead for final approach with the red left wing light flashing and the green right wing lit. But this craft had no lights at all, made no sound. It was low enough be heard, but no sound was heard! If it was the size of a 747 jet, then I would say it would have been about 1000 to 1200 feet above SL. What was more unusual to me was its belly. It had 3 round disks shapes connected to it. So in conclusion, It had a TRANGULAR SHAPE, was DARK GRAY (lit by the moon light) with 3 ROUND CIRCLES ON ITS BOTTOM. No airplane wings or rudder or ailerons were seen. It seem to be running in a stealth mode maybe because of its low alitude, but the moon gave it away. I was lucky enough to have my binocular in that direction otherwise I would have never seen it with the eye alone. I followed it for about 7 seconds until my shed blocked further viewing. I ran up to tell my wife and boy but they did not believe me at first but the next day they seemed more convinced by my going on and on about seeing it. PAST SIGHTING: My first was in 1967 over the Pacific Ocean standing on the San Francisco beach and it was at night. I never reported it as I did not think anyone would believe be. But, I did tell friends and family. If you want information on that sighting I would be glad to tell you? I am interested if others had seen it.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

In the city there are a lot of lights which contribute to light pollution and not being able to see the sky the way you would in more rural areas.  However looking at the sky you can tell the difference between helicopters, planes, and stars.  The lights we were seeing in the sky were neither a helicopter or a plane because it was too high and moved in strange patters with triangularly faint whitish blue lights, and the movement ruled out stars, as well as the light being perceived acted differently than a star would.  The lights would flicker or get duller and move quickly or slow down in strange patterns.  We perceived maybe around three in the ten or fifteen minutes we were outside.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
