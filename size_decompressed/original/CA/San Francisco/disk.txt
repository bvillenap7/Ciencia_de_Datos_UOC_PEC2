It was just still with no sound at all, glowing orange haze (corona discharge,now at age 35 i'm much informed of this topic)  Then it started to move slowly to the right of us (south) and keeped that speed of 50 to 75 miles in hour.{cause I can see the freeway at my home & the movement of cars seem the same(freeway 1 mile) the UFO keeped that speed until faded out of sight.   i still look in the sky   *  ((name deleted)) * ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the date is approximate.  It would surprise us if young children recorded the precise date of their sighting, although that is a guess.  PD));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Two Unidentified Flying Objects.;1980-06-15 21:45:00;2 minutes;Thirty two years ago I reported my UFO incident to AFSCA and kept a copy of my letter.  Here is my verbatim letter dated June 19, 1980. Sunday, June 15, 1980, at approximately 9:45 p.m. I witnessed two unidentified flying objects. First I noticed lightning from my bedroom window.  I did not hear any noise and as I approached the window I realized it was not raining.  The lightning was blinking behind my neighbor’s house.  As I scanned the city from my view I saw a UFO.  It was a weird design as I have illustrated here. These are red lights.  (Drawing)  It flashed one second and then disappeared. I focused my attention on the lightning behind my neighbor’s house and all of a sudden it stopped and a flying saucer ascended high above the neighbor’s roof.  The saucer appeared dark then lights went on.  It’s green and transparent so I could readily see it was occupied by one person.  The lights are brilliant and illuminated around the saucer and below the scene created a beautiful pattern.  It was immobile a few seconds then the lights went out and it disappeared.  For the next two minutes the lightning reappeared while far away in the distance the other UFO flashed once again. This was the last I saw of the two UFO’s.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Object moving slowly then at an extremely fast pace from the skyline;2003-04-23 22:20:00;00:10;Object moving slowly then at an extremely fast pace from the skyline a disk-shaped object with pulsating lights with a general color of white and slate blue emerged from behind low clouds and acted like a plane would in the way it trailed across the sky (from right to left, west to east in the southern sky) but then it zigged slightly and seemingly a bit too sharply for a plane or helicopter. about two seconds later it moved extremely quickly out, directly away from our vantage point and in a matter of a second it was a pinpoint then gone.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Circlulating lights, pulsating yellow squares;2006-12-06 21:00:00;5 mins.;Circlulating lights, pulsating yellow squares I find it hard to believe that I am so far the only person in San Francisco to report this (I can't find any account of this online anywhere), and I've never seen a UFO before and didn't really believe in them up until this, but I have no explanation for what I saw.  I first saw it out of the corner of my eye as I was reading a book as it passed over our apartment, and went to another window the check it out. It flew steadily with yellow/orange lights on its rim that circled intermittently like a neon sign. It has two small red lights on one side that didn't blink. There was also a sequence of rectangles on its underside that pulsated out from its center like this: [[[[ ]]]].  It flew steadily over the city and out of sight, at one point passing a plane that seemed to take no notice. But seeing it juxtaposed againt what was obviously an airplane made it seem even stranger looking. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Metallic saucer-like object seen over San Francisco Beach;2008-08-21 20:00:00;1/2 hour;Metallic saucer-like object seen over San Francisco Beach I was watching the sunset from Ocean Beach, when I noticed the object just south of and a little above the sun on the horizon line.  I thought at first it was a plane, but there were no lights blinking on it like there were on a plane over the nearby Marin Headlands.  it seemed to be made of metal, or something that reflects, and the bottom of it was like the bottom of a bowl, reflecting the light of the sun beneath it.  The top of it was like a smaller, upside-bowl, and although it appeared to be solid, it seemed to be invisible except where the sunlight was reflecting off of it, like I was seeing the outline of a bubble in the light.  My second thought was that it was a missile, because it moved like a missile, like it was up so high and was far enough away to appear to be moving very slowly, but it was moving towards the beach. I watched it from 7:30 to 8:08 pm, when the fog rolled in, and it disappeared. Several other people on the beach also witnessed it and took pictures with their cell phones.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Objects when passing are very neutral.;2009-05-14 20:00:00;5 min;Objects when passing are very neutral. The gateway to personal freedom in many respects is always locomotion. As someone who would like to color and present to you my experience of UFO sightings the above statement probably is most true. It is my sincere belief that the occasions within my scope of vision of flying craft qualify as those with special regard for airspace regulations and relative safety within US. To date every object has been almost like a passing passenger aircraft, marked with regular flashing airplane lights seen by me before. It is my sincere hope that one day we may know the true nature of these Unidentified Flying Craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Thanksgiving night, 2 UFOS move fast over SF and caught on tape.;2010-11-25 20:20:00;3 seconds;Thanksgiving night, 2 UFOS move fast over SF and caught on tape. I was in my backyard looking at the stars through my video camera when I saw the two UFOs. I was pointing the camera towards the NE about 45 degrees up when I caught the two disk shape UFO moving very, very fast from West to East. The UFOS were near the San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park area about 2000 to 3000 feet high. Without knowing their size, it would be difficult to judge the actual altitude. My home is under the SF bay approach for jets landing at the SF International Airport. I heard no sound from the UFOs and that is strange because it looked like they were moving much faster than the speed of sound and there was no sonic boom.  There has been a lot of  different UFO shapes that I have seen this year over SF. I was lucky to catch a lot of videos also.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Recorded a dark disk shaped object fly in between 2 blue angles.;2012-10-04 13:32:00;1 minute;Recorded a dark disk shaped object fly in between 2 blue angles. I was on the roof recording the blue angles,  An object/disk/saucer.. flew super fast in between 2 of the planes.  I downloaded it to my computer and paused it as it flew in between the 2 planes.  I could tell the shape wasnt like the planes. ((NUFORC Note:  We have written the source of this report, requesting that he send the photo to NUFORC for inspection.
