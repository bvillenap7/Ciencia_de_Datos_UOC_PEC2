Strange, hovering light in the San Francisco night sky - 5/7/02;2002-05-07 21:30:00;1.5 hrs;Strange, hovering light in the San Francisco night sky - 5/7/02 It was about 9:30pm and I was lying in bed trying to get to bed early for once.  I looked out my window at the stars for a few minutes.  Everything was normal, except that this one particularly bright star was moving.  At first, I just thought my mind was playing tricks on me, but it was clearly descending slowly in the night sky. It must have been hovering for the 5 minutes or so I was watching the stars, because it didn't catch my attention until it started descending slowly.  It dropped down below the buildings on the horizon, so it was out of my view. I tried to foget about it.  Around 11pm, I was still tossing and turning in bed, when I saw it again, over the same set of buildings.  It looked like a bright star, but this time I got out of bed and went onto my roof with some weak binoculars.  I know what I saw. It must have disappeared on my way down from my roof, because now it's gone.  This just happened a few minutes ago. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be serious-minded and sincere in his description of the event.  We presumed that he might have been witness to a celestial body, given its location and the manner in which it apparently descended slowly.  We apologize to the witness, in the event that our assumption was incorrect.  He insisted that his sighting could not have been the product of observing a star or planet.

PD)) My wife and I witnessed a large, extremely bright, spheroid object that appeared to be hanging in the air over San Francisco for a very long time. We watched the object for around an hour (at 4:30 am) and then went back to bed. It seemed to wobble, change shape and it definitely changed its brightness. With the binoculars it went from a narrow light too a round light, changed intensity and generally pulsed with a red hue around it. It is the brightest thing that I've ever seen in the night sky. We really couldn't tell how high it was. We were situated in the Richmond District of SF looking East towards Oakland and Berkeley. It could have been over the bay or over SF or even further East. However, it did not appear to be outside of the Earth's atmosphere.Did anyone else see an anomoly in the SF night sky that morning?;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
odd lower trajectory over crowded metropolitan area - morphed from single engine aircraft to irregular lighting pattern;2004-01-26 11:03:00;20 seconds;odd lower trajectory over crowded metropolitan area - morphed from single engine aircraft to irregular lighting pattern small unidentifiable aircraft, low elevation, inaudible, two to three different colored lights (red/white), very low speed, no FAA registration id located  From my vantage point in my apartment at 1960 Fulton St., it flew at a SW-NE direction at an altitude of about 600 feet (in reference to Transamerica Building comparison).  Lost visual aircraft contact level with Gillson Hall on USF campus.  At a certain point this aircraft was very identifiable to me as a small single engine Cessna-type aircraft.  However, it flew in a rather odd trajectory with the only identifiable features being an alternating red and white flashing lite.  I have spent some time gathering info. to report to the FAA and am submitting to this site first.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
A shiny dime sized metalic object appeared out of nowhere and vanished within 20 seconds overr San Francisco;2005-05-25 16:15:00;20 seconds;A shiny dime sized metalic object appeared out of nowhere and vanished within 20 seconds overr San Francisco I was on a tour boat on San Francisco Bay returning from Alcatraz Island. I was with two friends but they did not witness what I saw becuase by the time I told them it had already vanished.  The boat was apraoching San Franciso Pier 41, when I noticed a shiny metalic grey object that suddenly appeared over downtown San Francisco at no more than 10,000 feet,  It was the only object that caught my eye, from my view it appeared to be just a bit smaller than a dime, it moved slowly upwards for about 10 seconds than it rotated about 45 degree as if making a sharp left turn.  The bottom appeared flat with a slight bulge and a white center. There was shiny reflection that lasted about 10 seconds then it changed to a diamond shape and sped updwards at incredible speed and vanished completely leaving no trace.  The sky was mostly clear except for patches of low fog over the bay.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Bright lights, three horizontal rows, maybe ten lights across each row, each light was bigger and brighter than any star.;2008-02-09 19:30:00;1 minute;Bright lights, three horizontal rows, maybe ten lights across each row, each light was bigger and brighter than any star. I was walking my dog at around 7:30 in the evening my dog is old so we do a lot of standing not so much walking. I was looking up at the stars because it was a very clear night and to the east is the Oakland Airport, so there are always lots of planes to see.  All of a sudden to the northeast, I saw bright lights, which seemed to appear from nowhere and made the few plans in the sky look like distant stars. As they got closer, which took only 20 seconds or so, It looked like it could possibly be round, there were three rows of horizontal lights, maybe ten across on each row, each light five times bigger than the brightest star. They were not flashing, but at one point it seemed to turn, so the lights appeared to rotate slightly and the shape of the object changed into a wide V shape,I called out to my husband but by the time he got outside it had disappeared behind a building and I didn’t see it again.In all it lasted about a minute.I was looking east,it apeared from the northeast and it traveled south.  I have never personally seen a UFO, my husband has, and I’ve always laughed at his description and told him it was just a plane, or possibly a star. I have lived here for nine years and the 7:30 dog walk is a nightly routine, and I have never seen anything like this.  My husband just came in and dragged me outside to look at another “UFO”…it was a star.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

I opened the back door to let the dog out & noticed an extremely bright light.  At first disregarded, but a few minues later I opened it again to let dog in & the light had not appeared to move. For the following hour, we've continued to monitor this light(s). The lights are vaguely moving. The object seems to have grown closer & the light formation has seemed to change several times.  Will update later.... 10 minutes later, object seems to be moving down. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Bright Orange round ball, changed shape to elongated  object, then returnes into bright orange ball.;2012-01-12 22:30:00;5 minutes;Bright Orange round ball, changed shape to elongated  object, then returnes into bright orange ball. When leaving a meeting of our church, my husband looked up and asked me, Is that a planet or a star?  I looked and saw a bright orange round object (about the size of half my thumbnail) and said, Planets and stars are not bright orange.   It then disappeared and re-appeared to the left (close-by) in the shape of an narrow and long-shaped object.  It disappeared and then immediately re-appeared in the shape of a bright orange circle, exactly where the first round and bright orange object had been.   I told my husband, I think it's a UFO.   Haven't seen one in quite a while but now I have again, ((NUFORC Note:  The date above is defective.  We have assigned an arbitrary date, until we hear back from the witness.

Bright orange ball over San Francisco changed shape and repeated.;2014-01-06 22:30:00;5 minutes;Bright orange ball over San Francisco changed shape and repeated. my husband and I were leaving a meeting of our church when he noticed a bright orange bal in the sky over the area of San Francisco State University near-by.  He asked me if it was a star or a planet.  It was approxiamately the size of the first joint of my thumb if I were to make a fist.  It then disappeared and then slightly to the west we saw an elongated, narrow form still bright orange.  Then that disappeared and the bright orange ball reappeared back in its original location.I told my husband it probably was a UFO.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
