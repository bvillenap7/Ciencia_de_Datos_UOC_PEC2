translucent, silvery boomerang shape, totally silent, with short, feathering discharge from the back edge;2000-01-06 15:00:00;4 minutes;translucent, silvery boomerang shape, totally silent, with short, feathering discharge from the back edge Am am a professor of sociology at San Francisco State University.  I was walking my dog on the top of one of the bare hills in the city. It was a totally clear day.  When I looked up in the sky there was a translucent silver boomerang shaped object overhead, discharing a regular undulating wave of something (not a contrail)which never chanaged in length. The discharge was along the entire back edge.  It was totally silent. It appeared to be about as long (edge to edge) as a jetliner.  I have no way of estimating how far away it was, but it was an absolutely clear day, and the object was clearly visible but earily silent.  I continued to watch it move for about 3-4 minutes.  Then the dog wandered away, and by the time I found her,(maybe three or four minutes) the object was no longer visible, despite the fact that there was considerable visibility from where I was watching.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314

Thanksgiving Night 2010, Cheveron UFO flew over San Francisco, CA.;2010-11-25 20:00:00;15 seconds;Thanksgiving Night 2010, Cheveron UFO flew over San Francisco, CA. This Thanksgiving night 2010, I captured on videotape (from my back yard in San Francisco, CA.) a Chevron shaped UFO. It was heading True North and was seen East of my home about 60 degrees up. It looked like a ghost ship because it was a semi-transparent white color but it did have a detailed shape. I do not know the size or altitude of this UFO. If it did make a noise, I did not hear it because I think it was too far away. I also saw and videotaped 2 other different UFO shapes on this night. A seperate file will be sent on these UFOs.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
Chevron shaped object hovering and also slow moving, very high, over San Francisco;2017-07-05 17:30:00;15 minutes;Chevron shaped object hovering and also slow moving, very high, over San Francisco We (2 adults and a toddler) saw a sparkle shimmering in the sky from our balcony at home. At first glance it appeared like a very high airplane shimmering in the sun but it stayed still.  Though still, it did move very very slowly from the west to the east.  It stayed there hovering or slow moving at least 15 minutes.  It would shimmer, flash light and then disappear, then re-appear within seconds.   I went to get a camera with a 500 ml zoom lens and took some photos.  After downloading to my computer, I zoomed in further.  The object is boomerang shaped and it rotates around.  Sometimes in had red, orange and yellow colors, other times it had green and yellow.  Possibly this is from the rainbow spectrum of light bouncing off of it.  Otherwise it looks metallic, silver.  The sky was clear blue, no clouds.  There was no sound.  We saw an airplane pass by during this sighting and it made a typical noise, but otherwise the object did not have any sound.   This was on Wed July 5th, 2017, at about 5:30 pm.;37.7692925340357;-122.425427492314
