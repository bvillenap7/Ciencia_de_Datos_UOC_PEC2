Lights over orange county;2010-03-09 21:30:00;5 minutes;Lights over orange county I was in my backyard smoking and noticed a bright redlight in the sky west of of our home (in the direction of the Seal Beach Naval Air Station) the object was stationary and appeared to be hoovering in place. As I continued to admire the object a green light then became visible. The object red and green lights were located at the extreme ends, and appeared to be normal aircraft lights. I thought it was a helicopter because of them.  Then mulitiple white lights began began to flash and it moved laterally side to side very rapidly and then I called my mom to come out see what I was looking at.  The object hoovered still for a few more moments then repeated the same action and lights on the object went off.  It became a silvery white hazy color and sped of at an amazing amoutn of speed towards the northeast and stopped and hoovered again the red, green and white lights never came on again but the object still glowed(so to speak). about 15 seconds later the sped off into the sky again at an incredible speed into the sky.;33.8439;-118.0336
