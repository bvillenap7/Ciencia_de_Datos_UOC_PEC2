We looked and all saw what seemed to be a bright high flying object in space. I thought it was a comet. However we kept watching the dark  sky with NO MOON OUT and we had seen 4 more of these things the were flying close to the Saturn star but in various directions. Some faded out and came back into focus. One got very bright for a few seconds. I have looked into the sky for many years and I have never seen anything like this in my life.. After almost one hour we had seen no more and went home. Some of the bright objects where larger that others. All 5  were white. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD));33.8439;-118.0336
