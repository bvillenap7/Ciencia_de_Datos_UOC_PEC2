Gliding over Olive View Medical Center in early a.m. 06/03/99, definitely the first week in June 1999. 2.00 a.m. Duration 30 seconds. Single craft. Shape of a Manta-Ray (fish). Opaque or pale white in color. Size 10ft by 5ft. Gliding through the air above the Olive View Medical Center, upward and to the south. I observed this initially from my bathroom and then my bedroom. There was no exhaust trail or flashing lights. My thought was that it looked like a hang glider,but the nearest hang glider port in Sylmar is in the hills off of Hubbard St, which is  3 or 4 miles away and I have never observed anyone hang gliding in the night or early morning. There was no noise either. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in early June 1999 is approximate.  PD));34.3077000000001;-118.4287
