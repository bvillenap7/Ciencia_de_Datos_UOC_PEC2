I saw a bright spotlight high in the sky which resembled a floodlight.((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:05:00;45 seconds;Driving on the freeway, I saw a bright spotlight high in the sky which resembled a floodlight. Like the sky had a heavy cloud covering a full moon except for a corner, except the light made a cone-shaped spotlight.  Parallel to it was a cloudy blue light which stayed there even after the light disappeared.  Other parts of the sky were visible, and the moon was not in that location.  I can't describe how weird it was to see such a bright light.  Maybe a comet? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  U. S.
