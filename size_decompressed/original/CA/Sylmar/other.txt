Going higher, a beam of light shone from the object until it disappeared. My son and I saw what looked like a very bright shooting star, going up and not down.  It had a very wide tail that was also very bright.  We watched it go up into the sky for a total of approximately 10 minutes.  As it went higher, the intensity subsided.  It was in the northwestern sky above the mountains.  It changed direction after going up for about 5 minutes.  It then turned to a more northerly direction as it got smaller and higher.  As we looked at it, my son and I both saw what looked like a wide beam of light coming from this object shining down to earth.  We couldn't see it go all the way down because the light was partly behind the mountains at that time.As the object kept getting higher, we also noticed a smaller light below this object, approximately 3 inches below, if using your fingers to measure.  It was moving in a northeastly direction and moved very fast and again, using your fingers to measure, it moved approximately 5 inches in that direction and then it disappeared.  The first object continued moving higher and then it too disappeared.We watched for a few minutes longer but could not see either object anymore.;34.3077000000001;-118.4287
