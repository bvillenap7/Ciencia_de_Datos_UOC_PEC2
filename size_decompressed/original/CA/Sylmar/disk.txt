UFO sighted at 7:47PM Tuesday night in the san fernando valley area of California!;2008-10-28 19:47:00;30 seconds;UFO sighted at 7:47PM Tuesday night in the san fernando valley area of California! this just happened right now, i was on the way back home in the pasanger seat of my moms car because we went to go buy cigarettes for me and my dad. I saw a grayish saucer/disc shape in the sky and i told my mom what is that???? she got scared so she suddenly stopped...The shape has a white glow all around it. Right when she stopped the object i saw in the sky elevated directly upward in the sky 50-100 feet which made it not visable to me anymore due to the amount of clouds in the area it was in however the glow was still huge and there... there was no laser beam type stuff hitting the ground or anything though it was just a glow surrounding the entire object but it was really bright. Anyways, after she started driving back to my home (about 5 seconds later) it lowered it self back down to its original section i saw it in (50-100 feet back down) and the glow was really bright, i can see it clearly and i can see the clouds details so good because of its glow it had. Once it went back down 50-100 feet it vanished as if it was never there, i dont know... i might have blinked??????????!??!  Either way i beleive in UFO's and i have watched a lot of documentaries. I beleive 2% of the sightings i have read about or seen in documentaries and i beleive 1% of UFO sighting video tapes or stories however i DO beleive they exist due to science, nature, common sense... ANYWAYS i am mentioning my beleifs and disbeliefs for you guys to know this is REAL!;34.3077000000001;-118.4287
