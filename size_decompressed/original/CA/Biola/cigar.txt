It was long cigar shaped about 500 feet long with the under side giving off a bright white light.;1969-08-15 21:30:00;3 min;The town we lived in Biola was six miles west of Fresno, Ca.  On a warm summer night bout 9-10p.m. about eight of my friends and I were playing tag out in the middle of a one neon light lit common yard that everyone shared at the apartments we lived in.  As I tagged my friend and ran away, I could see looking back at him a bright light in the sky about six miles to the east of us.  I stopped playing to look at it and got all my friends to turn and look at it as well. It seemed to be hovering about 400 to 500 feet moving around slowly coming towards us like a helicopter with its bright spotlight.  Some of us thought it was a helicopter, but the light was very bright. Within a few seconds as we were looking at it, it suddenly in one quick movement advanced directly right over us and hovered there slowly moving east to west a few hundred feet over us.  The whole area lit up like the sun was out.  I looked around looking at the wooden fence and trees near by which were in the dark and now could clearly be seen with this bright light.  I also look around at my friends who were still looking up in awe.  I also heard a very low humming sound as it was going over us.  It was long cigar shaped about 500 feet long with the under side giving off a bright white light.  Along the outer edges near the under side were a row of different color lights going off and on. As soon as the body of the UFO completely passed over us, it quickly shot out to the west to the horizon in just a second.  Looking like just a bright light again, it stopped for a second and shot up almost straight up into the clear night sky looking like a shooting star, until we could no longer see it.
