Saratoga , Ca. sighting 10/25/1986 report has gone missing from NUFORC.;1986-10-25 17:00:00;30 minutes;Saratoga , Ca. sighting 10/25/1986 report has gone missing from NUFORC. I checked your reference page by state and also by date looking for a report listed in the city of Saratoga, Ca., that was witnessed back in October, 1986.  This report was there a year ago and was there for several years, and now it is missing.  It was a very extensive report and this sighting was reported in the San Jose Mercury News on two separate days because the UFO did appear twice around the same area for two days. It was close to my house. After this appearance, I started to experience sounds like electronic tones in Morse Code for about three months.  I was looking for this report because I wanted to use it for reference and now it is deleted.  Can it be restored or has it been disappeared?  Sincerely, ((name deleted)));37.2713;-122.0227
