Strange lights in norh east sky Saratoga, CA.;2015-10-04 20:40:00;30 minutes;strange lights in norh east sky saratoga, ca I was out in backyard with dog looking up at the night sky as i usually do.  I noticed 2 stars that were real bright one above the other, I thought it was a part of a star formatation this was in the north east sky, in fact everything I saw was in the north east sky last night.   Anyways these 2 bright star shapes just got real bright and both just went dark one after the other. I was looking at the spot they had been and noticed an orange light very faint streaking very fast heading north, i thought maybe a satellite, but the about 2 minutes later i see 2 more of these faint orange lights going across the sky but they were headed in opposite directs at the same time, they passed by each other one going south and the other going north, i have never seen that before if they were satellites, but 3 of them in a 3 minute span is odd. I thought wow that was alot of action in the north east sky.  I sat down and looked to a star I saw that was sort of dim in the north ! east sky, then right below it a bright orange light flared up and went dark, this happened about 3 times in a 5 minute span of time. that was the last of the activity I saw the rest of the night, I'll be out there tonight with telescope and camera hoping to catch something.;37.2713;-122.0227
