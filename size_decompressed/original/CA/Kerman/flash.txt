At first I thought it was a child's ball, however a child's ball would not be flying that high.  It rolled slowly across the nights sky. It was not a bright ball of fire, it was more like a glowing coal.  You could see that some spots were brighter than others. I could see it rolling onerhead when suddenly it disapeared before my eyes. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.7336;-120.0739
