Clear slow moving whatever.;2013-10-23 17:00:00;5 minutes;clear slow moving whatever after work as I was closing gates I noticed two fighter jets flying west in formation fairly high.  as I watched closely I noticed about half way between myself and jets a glimmer.  I watched very close to try and figure out what I was looking at it appeared to be falling and  as I waited for it to fall to the ground to find out what I had been looking at around two hundred feet up it seemed to stop falling and started on a south eastern flight.  the best I could describe what I saw a 20ft by 20ft sheet of cellifain would not have noticed it but sunlight would reflect off of it as it would turn. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.7336;-120.0739
