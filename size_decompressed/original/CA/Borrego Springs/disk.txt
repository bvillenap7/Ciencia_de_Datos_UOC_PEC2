Had faintly illuminated geometric pattern on at least one side. Having just returned home to the dark desert from light-polluted San Diego, I got out of my car and observed the night sky for a moment. Looking high towards the west, I was gazing upon the Milky Way when I noticed a circular part of the star field (approximately the size of an extended hand) begin to shift slightly. The stars in this circular area appeared to slowly swirl about, almost as if they were being passed over by a lens. This occurred for a total of approximately 10 seconds. Then without warning, the circular area began to slowly tumble, revealing that it was what appeared to be a nearly flat disc. As it began its tumble, it shifted its appearance from that of a refracted star field, to a grid-like geometric pattern, very faintly illuminated on a completely black background. The disc tumbled for about 1-2 seconds before stabilizing and speeding off toward the southwest. I was unable to determine the size or distance of the object.
