Sun glare reveals craft.;2013-12-26 16:15:00;20 seconds;Sun glare reveals craft. Date of sighting: December 26, 2013 Time: Approx 4:15 pm Lenght of sighting: 20 seconds. Place: Sighted from Hiway S22, about 8 miles east of Borrego Springs, California.  Object over a peak on Coyote Mountain. Sighted a sun glare atop a desolate mountain peak while travelling east on S22.  I noted an RV at the bottom of this mountain with a similar sun glare.  Very familar with this area and knowing that no shiny object could be atop that mountain I stopped the vehicle to get a better look.  The object then moved a short distance and the glare abated.  The object was plainly visible as a large solid white ball larger than the RV still in view.  This object moved slowly over the top of the mountain and down out of sight into the canyon behind.;33.2392;-116.3502
