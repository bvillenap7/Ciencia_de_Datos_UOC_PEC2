Glare again seen.;2014-02-06 16:39:00;5 seconds;Glare again seen. Sun glare seen again on Coyote Mountain about eight miles east of Borrego Springs, CA, off Highway S22.  I made a similar report on Dec. 26, 2013.  In that case a solid object was observed after the glare abated.  This time the glare itself took flight slowly and moved off into a gorge in the mountain.  This sighting was on different peak of the same mountain but close by.  At first sighting the object was stationery prior to flying into the gorge.  I do not suspect a helicopter.  No aircraft would be in that position on this obscure mountain or make such a dangerous flight.;33.2392;-116.3502
Long string of lights moving across the early morning sky above a mountain ridge;2020-11-26 05:15:00;5 minutes;Long string of lights moving across the early morning sky above a mountain ridge A long string of lights, either one long craft with a dark center section or two separate craft, moving NNE to SSW  over and along a mountain ridge. Iâ€™d estimate I was 12 miles from it. Like a well-lit train moving leisurely across the sky.;33.2392;-116.3502
