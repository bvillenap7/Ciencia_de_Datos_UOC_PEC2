WQe had just finished relaxing and eating and were headed back to our motel room in town driving east when we saw five sort of shimering objects on the horizon .shimering spots of light like flames in thr distance. At first I thought it was a fire on the side of Rabbit Peak  and even started to call 911 to report the fire I thought was high upon the mountain, but then the lights went out and reappeared as only two larger bright lights a little farther to the south on the horizon and a little higher up in the sky but still close to the horizon. looking east they stayed stationary like the 5 lights for about 2 minutes and then they also faded away.It was too dark to tell if they were high on the mountain or just above the mountains ridge line. they were seen is uninhabited very rugged terrain and the lights could not have been campers because they were too far away to be that bright by campers and it was 110 degrees that day. no one would have been up there and because it was dark I couldnt tell if the lights originated on the mountan or above the ridge line in the sky. My wife and I both saw them They were not planes because they did not move but also they did not blink like plane lights but shimmered like glowing hovering flames or pulses of light;33.2392;-116.3502
