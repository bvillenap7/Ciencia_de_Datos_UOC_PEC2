It was around 2:40 in the morning a we saw a round and white light to the north of us we I thought it was the north star it was so bright until it started acting very weird it got bigger started to pulsate very fast got even brighter then it started to fade like dim out and it took off to the east. There were about 6 people who saw it but they don’t believe that it was a UFO they shook of out to be a meteor or something. But it was stationary to the north it did not move until it went east…;34.0024;-118.1554
