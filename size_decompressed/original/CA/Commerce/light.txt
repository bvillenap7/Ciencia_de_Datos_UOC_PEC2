star like object race across the sky;2004-02-12 13:35:00;15 minutes;star like object race across the sky Today, I saw one star-like object travel faster than any airplane that I've ever seen, it hovered, changed directions and went straight up...? This happened in complete daylight with clear visabilty about 10 miles from LAX. I was born and raised in this area and I'm very familiar with aircraft, helocopters and small aircraft landing or flying near LAX. The very fast movement across the sky behind the airplanes which I had been observing all morning is what caught my attention in the first place.  I was observerving contract linemen install an 80 foot power pole near an energized line for the power company that I work for. It was my job to shout out constant reminders of thier proximty to the energized lines on which they were working on.I was aware of thier presence the whole time, aproximately 10 hours. This practice is very common among electric workers and is a very useful and traditional way of keeping linemen safe and aware of danger. I had to keep my glance on them constantly because they were working adjacent to a hot line.Off in the distance while observing the linemen,is when I saw a white star moving across the sky in a pattern that reminded me of an insect. Not a straight line... but very erractic,  like a fly. I called one of the groundmen (person who assits the linemen from the ground) over to verify what I have been observing. It was one star streaking across the cloudless sky.It joined a formation of other stars 5, when they circled, hovered motionlessly about a minute, then went straight up. We obseved one of these objects turn off and then on and restore itself to it's original brilliance,until we could no longer see them.We observed one object breakaway and go due north and up before we could no longer see it.;34.0024;-118.1554
