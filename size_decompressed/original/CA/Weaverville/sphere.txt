This is similar to my previous report in that it was the same general location and same color although this time the object was moving at great speed and at a greater distance from me(size of object was much smaller then my previous report.   Although the distance was greater then my previous report I estimated the angle from my location was 70 degrees from first observation to its disappearance and I timed it as a 7 second sighting.  1 Mississippi  2 Mississipi ....;40.7247;-122.9297
