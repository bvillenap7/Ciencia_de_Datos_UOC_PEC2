White flashing light.;2020-07-15 01:52:00;2 minutes;White flashing light. This is not the first time i have seen this flash of light.  its not steady like an air craft. and there is only 1 white light. the first time i saw it was several days earlier.  it did a tight circle and dis appeared then it moved and flashed going to the south east.  I grabbed my cell phone a d had it ready if i was it again.  and i have a video.  I also saw it on one of the nights i was the ISS go over it was like 30 insteps behind it.  wish i hade better camera equipment.  my daughter saw it again two weeks ago when we were star gazing while camping.;38.6741;-121.3768
