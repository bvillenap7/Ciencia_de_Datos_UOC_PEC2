Red light shooting red objects down to earth.;2011-01-05 01:30:00;1 minute;Red light shooting red objects down to earth. January 5th 2011   At exactly 1:30 AM over North Highlands California, a friend and I had witnessed a red light hovering in the sky.  This craft was shooting what looked like red laser lights down to earth.   After shooting about 10 beams, the craft floated around for about 10 seconds then instantly disappeared like turning out a light. This one craft sighted was round in shape. The area which it was hovering over is considered suburban.;38.6741;-121.3768
