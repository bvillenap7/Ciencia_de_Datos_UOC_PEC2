Three lighted, yellow circles rotating across the sky in a straight path.;2003-12-14 18:30:00;2 minutes;Three lighted, yellow circles rotating across the sky in a straight path. Three lighted, yellow, circles rotating around eachother. No sound, moving through the sky at a high speed. Traveling from east to west. Can't judge the altitude, but but much lower then commercial airlines fly. Objects traveled from one horizon to the other until visual was lost. The objects flew around each other in a very distinctive manner, but traveled in a straight path across the sky.;38.6741;-121.3768
3 Circular White Lights Seen From Watt Ave/I80 Light Rail Station;2018-08-15 22:15:00;10-15 minutes;3 Circular White Lights Seen From Watt Ave/I80 Light Rail Station Driving south on Watt Ave, at the I-80 Light Rail Station my 15 year old great niece noticed 3 white, circular lights in the sky, clumped together moving slowly.   As I was doing the driving, I was unable to look immediately.  When I was able to glance over, I saw one of the lights very, very fast zig-zagging in place and then an airplane or helicopter moving very, very fast in the direction of the 3 white round lights.  We looked for the 3 white lights and they were gone.  This was over a 10 -15 minute time frame.;38.6741;-121.3768
