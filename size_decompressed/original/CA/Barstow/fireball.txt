It was dark and as I drove in the right hand lane I saw the object fall to earth with a green flash behind it. This occured at about 9pm or so.  There appeared to be empty fields to the right of me, no buildings or trees, just barren or farm land, I saw it come down, not like a shooting star which you observe in the sky, but close to earth, vanishing on the horizon.
