Bright lights;1969-08-10 00:00:00;8- 10 seconds;Bright lights It was late and my parents were out so us kids snuck out to the play ground area.  We were on the playground structure when a low bright light few over. Followed by another a second or two then followed by a small red light.  It was so bright that lit up the whole playground as if it was daylight. There was no sound only a feeling of presence.  Maybe a minute or so later we heard about two jets fly over but could not see them.  At the time we dismiss the incident as secret test that were being conducted at the local Air Force base near by.  It wasnâ€™t until Close Encounters of the Third Kind was released that I realized it was more then test. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Falling star over Barstow, CA went from a falling star to traveling east/west and skyward.;2005-11-20 17:58:00;5 minutes;Falling star over Barstow, CA went from a falling star to traveling east/west and skyward. Driving south, south-west on Interstate 15 south of Barstow, CA, my Navigation/GPS screen began malfunctioning.  The screen began flickering and turning to a blue background and the GPS location symbol indicating my vehicle location froze.  Moments later we (my wife & I) noticed what we initially thought to be a shooting star falling directly in front of our driving direction what appeared to be approx. 1 mile away.  The falling star light remained as bright as the planet Jupiter as seen with our naked eyes, as it was falling in the sky adjacent to Jupiter in the southern night sky.  The falling star was falling at a tremendous speed as we have noticed other falling stars in the desert.  This light was traveling straight down as opposed to an angle that other falling stars we have previously noticed.  The falling star went from a high falling speed from approx. 80 degees above the horizon to an immediate stop approx. 15 degrees above the horizon.   The falling star light remained stationary for approx. 1 min.  The light began to move off to the west at a slow but contant speed, similar to the speed of an aircraft and the light began to oscillate with white, red and blue lights.  Using Jupiter in the sky as a point of reference, the light turned to the west of Jupiter where it stopped.   The light then began to travel east, stopped momentarily and then traveled straight up from 15 degrees above the horizon to approx. 40 degrees above the horizon.  I have a MS degree from UCLA and previously earned my private pilot's license for single engine aircraft.  I have no knowledge of any aircraft able to maneuver as I witnessed.;34.8924;-117.0451
