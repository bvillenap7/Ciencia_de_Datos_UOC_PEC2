At 2041 Hrs. on 06/19/08, I was traveling eastbound I-40 approximately 10-12 miles east of the Barstow/Dagget Airport, when I observed a bright white pulsating light to the north. The light was what I can estimate, 3 or 4 miles above the mountain range.  Believing it was landing lights on an airplane I focused back on the road. Several minutes later I looked back and the object was in the same place and I started to look for the nav lights on the wings. As the object pulsated I could clearly see a dark outlines of the object (round or oblong) and no red and green lights were seen. As I drove east on I-40 I observed the object for the next 8 minutes  (11 minutes in total) up till I saw the object quickly shot straight up, the light fading out at which time the object was out of sight.;34.8924;-117.0451
