Strange lights:red, blue, green, and yellow in Barstow CA.;2003-08-29 04:00:00;1HR;Strange lights:red, blue, green, and yellow in Barstow CA. My girlfriend and I went to visit my brother who is stationed at Fort Irwin Military Base in Barstow Ca.  We reached the post around 1:15AM.  My brother and I stood outside and drank some beers and the time just flew!  My brother all of a sudden told me to take a look at this helicopter that must have stopped someone on the I15.  But, as the time continued to go (around a half an hour 4:00 AM to 4:30 AM) the helicopter never moved.  We assumed it was a police helicopter because the lights at first were only red and blue flashing lights.  This was around 4:30 AM and the lights started flashing in this order, red, blue, green, and yellow very very quickly.  I told him that I was going to go wake up my girlfriend so that she could prove that we were not seeing things!  He woke his wife and I woke my girlfriend and at first, they thought It was Mars but mars was directly behind us.  As we all starred together we noticed it started moving quickly then slowly then it appeared to get close then far, but it only stood in a certain section of the sky.  At around 5:00 AM it went out like a candle light, but for whatever reason it reappeared.  We were tired so we went to sleep. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a twinkling star would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out, before we could accept that the object was a bona fide UFO.  PD));34.8924;-117.0451
