Two white (non blinking) lights at the end of a short cigar shaped object...red light came on between them.;2000-07-06 22:00:00;10 minutes;Two white (non blinking) lights at the end of a short cigar shaped object...red light came on between them. This occurance was on I-15 between Vegas and Los Angeles......it was West of Barstow ( I had to estimate the time). We had the top off our car and my husband said, What's that above us? I looked up and saw 2 lights which were traveling one behind the other...headed west/northwest....They were SO close together that I assumed they HAD to be one light at each end of a Cigar shaped object. We watched it for at LEAST 10 minutes. About 2 minutes into it....a red light Came ON in between the 2 white lights (none of the lights blinked). It stayed on for a minute or so...then went off. It turned on....then off...a couple more times. We watched it until it went behind a mountain. When we finally rounded the mountain (15 minutes or so) I saw 2 bright lights on the horizon....FAR away from each other. May have been insignificant.... As I watched ...one of the lights just went off. Strange!;34.8924;-117.0451
White, cigar shaped, large, high, no noise, fast, no chemtrail to say jetliner.;2015-10-01 03:30:00;1 minute;White, cigar shaped, large, high, no noise, fast, no chemtrail to say jetliner. It was as high as the clouds, cigar shaped, white, made no noise, had no chemtrail, was faster that any jetliner at the hight it was going, must of been huge, or atleast large.  I grabbed my binoculars to try to see it, but I couldnt get a good view, but as i was trying to look, it disappeared without a trace, it could have gone behind a cloud, and that could mean it was a plane, but there was no trail at all. Im sorry if it could be a false alarm.;34.8924;-117.0451
