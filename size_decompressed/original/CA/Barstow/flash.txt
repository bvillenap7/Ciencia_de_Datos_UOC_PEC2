Flashing light moving in a zigzag pattern;2016-05-25 04:15:00;5 minutes;Flashing light moving in a zigzag pattern On the morning at 04:15 of 25 May, 2016, my son and I were star gazing in our front yard.  To the East of our house there was a fast moving flash of light.  We both thought that it was a satellite and watched it move.  We both were surprised on the brightness and the flashing frequency it had.   As it was moving in a North North West direction, we noticed the movement was in an arcing path, not a straight path.  Also, the flashing was moving in a zigzag pattern from left to right.  A flash on the left then a flash in a diagonal direction to the right.  No sound was associated with the flashing light.  Unfortunately, I have no visual evidence for this event. I work with and on military aircraft for a living and have never seen anything with the light pattern or movement such as my son and I witnessed.  I live South of China Lake Naval Air Station and the flight path of the flashing light is not in the air corridor for China Lake NAS or the Edwards AFB fast mover corridor which is North or China Lake NAS.;34.8924;-117.0451
