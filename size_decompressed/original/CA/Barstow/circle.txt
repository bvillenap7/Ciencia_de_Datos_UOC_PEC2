I ;2001-10-04 19:00:00;1 hour;I was traveling on Interstate 40 at 7:00 when I saw a beautiful sunset of the desert, on vacation on the colorado river, in Needles. I noticed a small red, contrail from an airliner. I at first glance traveling 60mph, om I-40, thought how beautiful the contrail was. Then I noticed it was staionary and not moveing, after 15 minutes. I then, thought perhaps, it was a comet. Since I have not followed, any reports on comets like Hale/Bopp. This contrail, was, then  degradeing yet, a new contrail was being formed. I could see clearly, a jet large airliner being, in slow motion, or stopped in the sky. Below that a small round, grayish U.F.O. wa dancing, and going back and fourth, under the airliner. The airliner was stationary, burning fuel, and creating a contrail, as this UFO hovered about 7 thousand feet under the large liner. I noticed many people watching this in the Bartow, Daggaet(Solar Power area)and this, was 50 miles from Edwards airforce base. I clearly saw a round UFO,and this jet, with small contrail, and it was redish, with the sun, setting, and was below the hortizon, or mountains. It was beautiful and spectacular, and was the most bizzar, thing I ever see. I felt it was showing off for all the cars traveling along I-40, that evening. I called the Highway Patrol in Barstow, they said they got hundreds of phone calls on this. They said it was a helicopter. I say it was a UFO, round, gray, and makeing a motion, for attention. Then after I was under it, the UFO , went away, and the airliner was free, to travel, to its destination.;34.8924;-117.0451
orange fireball, shape shifting, moves at ridiculous speed, encountered on wayt to las vegas.;2005-06-11 23:40:00;4 minutes;orange fireball, shape shifting, moves at ridiculous speed, encountered on wayt to las vegas. I just want to describe an incident that I had seen about 2 years ago which I saw a redish orange fireball. At first it had the diameter close to the moon and was highup. Then it dropped down at such an incredible speed.  At first my mom thought that it was some kind of light that was behing the mountains until it zipped right onto our leftside.  Then it receded its shape into an ellipse thinning itself out then disappear behind the mountains.  Then it would zip back up into view above the mountains.  It would constantly change shape. this went on for about 4 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));34.8924;-117.0451
