Metalic ball over orange county summer 2006;2006-07-10 13:00:00;1 to 2 hours;Metalic ball over orange county summer 2006 On the date of the shuttle landing in Summer of this year 2006 while my girlfriend and I were swimming around 1pm (pst), I noticed a ball in the sky almost directly overhead and in the western sky. I watched the object first assuming it was a balloon. After sometime I noted that it was stationary in altitude and traveling in an arc from south-west heading northerly and arcing toward the west. Its speed was very slow where it took aproxamatly 1 hour to travel about the length of my hand (from fingertip to wrist). It apeared about the size of a pea at its distance and with passing aircraft leaving and aproaching the Fullerton airport, I was able to guess it to be about the same altitude. It apeared silver or metalic in color and had a dull hue to it, almost gun metal grey. I pointed it out to my girlfriend who watched it for some time. It eventually moved out of sight behind our apartments. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689
