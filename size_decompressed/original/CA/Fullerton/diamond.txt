Diamonds in sky flying toward each other, and then slowly disappearing.  ((anonymous report));2017-05-01 03:23:00;7;Diamonds in sky flying toward each other, and then slowly disappearing. A bright star was flying north west near the moon, we thought it was a satellite.  One other object flew towards it as they were going to collide.  They then made a circle around each other and then spread many miles apart.  They stayed in the same positions, until slowly fading away.

Two diamond objects move toward each other and then seem to collide separate and then stop moving.;2017-05-01 15:30:00;30 minutes;To diamond objects move toward each other and then seem to collide separate and then stop moving We were all in the backyard, Monday afternoon, and my friend told me that the moon looked beautiful in the blue sky so I looked up at the moon and noticed a star moving very rapidly North.  I assumed it was a satellite, or maybe the international space station, because it was reflecting light.  I pointed it out to my friend and then he told me there was another one coming towards it.   When they started heading towards each other very quickly he even exclaimed oh my god they're going to hit each other.  The two bright star-like objects then spread apart many miles and stopped moving.  They were motionless for another five minutes, or so, but slowly getting dimmer and dimmer, until we could not differentiate them from the blue sky.   I was in my backyard and these objects were about 60Â° into the sky.  I was looking east Towards the moon that was lit up in the daylight sky.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689
