Vertically moving object that was glowing and accelerating quickly;2012-01-13 17:00:00;3 seconds or so;Vertically moving object that was glowing and accelerating quickly My fiancee and I were driving through an intersection when we saw a bright light way bigger than a normal plane or helicopter, way brighter, and way quicker.  I would say this was about 20 times brighter than the light you see from planes, as well as about 30 times bigger, and its speed accelerated in a weird way.  At first I thought it was a meteorite coming down and I was waiting for some sort of explosion in the distance but nothing happened.  This was not super close to where we were in terms of distance, it was miles away.  The object was only visible for a few seconds and travelled vertically towards the ground.  It started high and was moving quickly, and after a second or so its speed doubled or more and it quickly got much brighter.  It all happened so fast.   It looked like it travelled through our whole atmosphere in less than 2-3 seconds and I don't know if the glow came from that or whatever happened.   My fiancee and I were stunned and even though we both saw it because of its super bright shine we didn't say anything to each other until it was over because we didn't want to take our eyes away from what was happening.  It was so spectacular she even forgot for a second that she was driving and had to slam the brakes to avoid hitting another car. I don't know what this was but I don't think it was a crashing plane or a meteorite because I haven't heard anything about it on the news. I'm left with this weird curiosity.  I never thought I'd see something like this. Thank you!;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689
