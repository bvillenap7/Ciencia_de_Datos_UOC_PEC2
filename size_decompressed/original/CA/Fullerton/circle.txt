test aircraft or ufo?;1990-06-01 22:00:00;5 mins;test aircraft or ufo? it was years ago so the details are kinda foggy,   i came home to my rental house sometime between 1030 and12:00, i saw a large round disc shaped object that was no more than 30 feet above the houses moving very slowly and silent... best guess is 60 ft x 20.. heading southward, very slowly as i said. i can verify later. i thought it was a test blinp or something, i watched it for 5-10 mins. then went inside. it was still there when i went inside. 20 some years later, i'm still trying to find a picture of the blimp... can't find anything close.. starting to think it was something else... only reason i thought it was a blimp is because it was so close/ slow/ early that it woul have been repoted to somebody...... i can narrow down the date, and provide exact loation.... even draw it...would like to know if it was some kind of test or a ufo . lots of test aircraft in that area of California..  i'm very sceptical but, i can't get it off my mind.. even 20 some years llater ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

green star like object shot across sky;2005-11-14 21:00:00;10 seconds;green star like object shot across sky We were driving down State College Blvd in Fullerton, CA.  It was about 9pm.   We saw a blue/green star like object hovering in the sky.  It suddenly shot across the sky like a shooting star, although you cannot see stars in the sky here (at least very many) and it was too low for a star.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689
A bright, spinning sparkling saucer shaped UFO seen in Fullerton, CA;2009-01-16 19:00:00;30 seconds;A bright, spinning sparkling saucer shaped UFO seen in Fullerton, CA I saw a streak of what looked like a plane on fire in the sky so i went out to see it, but when i got a closer look it was a round saucer shape and was spinning low in the sky only about a mile or two away.  It looked like it was encircled in sparks or flames, it was very bright and would blink on and off. It moved quickly and after about 30 seconds it disappeared.
