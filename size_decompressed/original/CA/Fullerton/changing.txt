My UFO skeptic Mom and level headed brother observed a very large boomerang shaped object. It traveled west to east, stopped, changed s;1998-11-07 17:30:00;5 minutes;My UFO skeptic Mom and level headed brother observed a very large boomerang shaped object. It traveled west to east, stopped, changed shapes. About 1730 hrs. my mother and brother were sitting on our west facing porch when my mother observed what she described as,  the weirdest thing I've ever seen.  She directed my brother's attention to the object, who dismissed it as an airplane.  Unconvinced, my mother told him to look again, which he did and upon second inspection, was unsettled by the nature of what he and my mother were seeing.  Neither of them have ever claimed to have seen or experienced any ufo sighting or anything remotely paranormal.  They describe the object as being roughly twice the size of a jumbo jet (LAX's landing flight path lies just to the north of our home and while sitting on our porch we probably view more than 20 jet's coming in for landing, so i'm confident of their estimation of size.)   The object had white very large white lights covering the bottom of it's boomerang shape.   As it passed over and headed west(at an altitude of approximately 15-20 miles, {brother's estimation}, it came to a stop over the foothills of the city of Orange. It commenced then changed into the shape of a straight line and remained as such for approximately one minute. It then began to cange shape again, this time, the left end of the line began to curl under and spiral into itself and it's luminosity increased to the brightness of a star and remained as such when my mother and brother, a bit unnerved by the event,  came back inside in complete bewilderment.  Upon my arrival home after work, they told me what they had experienced and my complete confidence that if, they say they saw it, someone else must have as well.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689
Stationary Silver object seen at very high altitude appeared to be descending while reflecting sunlight;2007-07-09 17:00:00;15 min.;Stationary Silver object seen at very high altitude appeared to be descending while reflecting sunlight On July 9, 2007 between 17:00 and 17:30 hours a friend and I were sitting on lounge chairs by a pool in Fullerton, CA and looking in a Southeasterly direction.   At an extremely high altitude we observed what appeared to be a silver object that occasionally reflected sunlight.  At first it appeared to be stationary but then we believed it to be falling or descending.  It also appeared to be drifting further toward the Southern sky as it descended.   We watched it for approximately 15 minutes as it moved in front of some clouds and through other clouds.   At one point a small single engine plane flew over at a much lower altitude than this object.  During the 15 minutes it never appeared to get much lower.   At first I thought it might be a parachute, but it appeared that at least one of the surfaces that reflected light was flat and metallic.   After 15 minutes I went inside to get a pair of binoculars.  By the time I returned my friend had lost sight of the object in the clouds.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689
