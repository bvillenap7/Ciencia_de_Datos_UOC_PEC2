Bright silver/white disc seen north of Fullerton, California;2011-08-20 18:00:00;1 hour;Bright silver/white disc seen north of Fullerton, California At around 5:45pm on Saturday, August 20, 2011, I was sitting in my backyard at my home in Fullerton, CA looking at the clouds and sky when I noticed a very, very, bright white disk-shaped light in the sky next to a cloud pattern.  It was unusually bright, like an arc welder.  I ran into the house to get my binoculars because it was so odd to see such a bright light during daylight hours. With my binoculars, I could clearly see that this was a perfectly round object or light, there were no wings, rotors, or other visible appendages to the disc shape.  I called for my 21 year old son to come out and look at it. I couldnâ€™t determine the distance of the object from my location but my best guess is that it was at least 15 miles due north of us.  The object moved slowly east, behind the wispy clouds and then moved west again out of the clouds to become visible again. The object moved east and back to the west, in front of clouds and behind clouds, and in clear sky.  It moved relatively slowly, it also moved higher and lower by hundreds of feet several times during the hour or so that we were able to observe it.  The object moved north and northwest until we were no longer able to see it. My wife was at a school function and I tried calling her a few times while we were observing the object.  I was not able to reach her.  The first call was made at 6:04pm, the second at 6:19, and the last at 6:41.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689
