I and friends observed a slow moving object which dropped other objects before disappearing from view.;2007-11-04 21:55:00;5-10 minutes;I and friends observed a slow moving object which dropped other objects before disappearing from view. On the evening of November 4, 2007 at nine fifty-five PM I was sitting at a table on the patio of McClainâ€™s Coffeehouse on Harbor Blvd. when my friend observed an object hovering in the South Eastern sky above cloud level.  Upon further examination by myself and the three other people sitting at the table, the object had no other lights and shone only as a large glowing orange light, much like a fireball.  We then noticed that the object was moving very slowly toward our direction, though still miles away.  After a short while the object stopped and hovered in place, moving slightly and then appeared to turn over at which point it was revealed that there were multiple lights on the object, all the same orange color.  The object then moved back in the same direction it had come at approximately the same speed. It was at this point that two of my friends and I walked down to the end of the block to listen for any sounds, such as helicopter rotors, which might have helped identify the object.  As we were walking to the end of the block I noticed a small light fall from the object, glowing like fire and then disappearing almost like an ember, which had fallen and gone out.  I pointed this out to my friends and we then observed several more of these small objects falling from the main object before the main object itself disappeared from view, presumably behind clouds.  When we returned to the patio many people were standing up looking in the direction where the object had disappeared and they were all talking about it.   I have no idea what kind of flying craft this object could have been or what was falling from it or why.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689
Two bright fireballs seen in the northeastern sky above Fullerton, California.;2008-01-26 18:00:00;5 minutes;Two bright fireballs seen in the northeastern sky above Fullerton, California. Was walking home from the train station when in the north, northeast sky two large balls of light were spotted, I continued observing them, thinking them to be either planes or helicopters, when I noticed that the lights had tails, like fireballs. Thinking that they were meteorites, I continued walking, until I noticed that they both were not flying in a set path, but were instead moving rather rapidly, I continued watching, occasionally the light would die down to a small, almost pinpoint light that flashed about every second, but eventually the fire would flare back up and the objects would continue to fly, one even discharged what I thought was a ember that quickly died out and vanished.  While I was alone on the ground, I noticed an airplane with two headlights and a large wingspan flying above me, observing the UFOs, they eventually went over the horizon, and while I lost my visualization, the plane did not, and continued to follow them for as long as I was in the area and even after I left, I would assume after leaving Fullerton, the objects flew over Brea, and eventually the City of Industry, but that is left up to speculation based on their flight path at the time of the sighting.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689

Orange ball of light moves slowly across the sky, then disappears in a flash of white.;2012-02-01 23:40:00;5 minutes;Orange ball of light moves slowly across the sky, then disappears in a flash of white. Object was a ball of Orange light that moved slowly in a Northwestern direction.  It seemed to stay in one spot in the sky for a few moments, then grew smaller quickly and finally disappeared. Right after disappearing we saw a small flash of white light from the same area of the sky, and then there was no more lights of any kind. There were three of us that witnessed this.  We are all in our late twenties, early thirties. The ball of light was much larger in the beginning of the sighting and as it moved west it grew smaller exponentially.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689
