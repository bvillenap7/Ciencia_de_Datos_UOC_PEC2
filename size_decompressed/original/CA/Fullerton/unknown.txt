On March 20, 2014, at approximately 6:10 AM PDT in Fullerton, CA, I observed an orange colored object race across the sky at a rate of speed of less than one second.   The object appeared to be round, and made no sound.  It came from the north and went south with a slight curve as if following the curvature of the earth.   It was not a shooting star because it didnâ€™t leave a trail behind it.   Also, this was an orange color which appeared to be almost translucent, but I could not make out the shape of it.   I am wondering if anyone else reported this object.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689

I think I may have finally seen something inexplicable. I say that only because of the manner of movement. I'm very aware of all the different forms of earthly craft and how they move. They don't start and stop unless they are helicopters but these were too high. much higher altitude than helicopters can go. The light emitted was yellow orange red and constant not blinking and very bright. There were two following each other South to North at about the altitude of passenger jets. The first one begin to fade and then faded to nothing.  The second one stopped moving  for about 30 seconds and then began to move again.  Then it began to go upward untill it faded to nothing.  As if to leave the atmosphere?  The color and the manner of movement was like nothing I've ever seen otherwise I would just dismiss it. I'm searching to see if there's anything reported that might provide a logical explanation. There must have been other people somewhere looking up at the sky at that same time and saw what I saw.  From my perspective it may have been high above the coast of Newport Beach.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689
