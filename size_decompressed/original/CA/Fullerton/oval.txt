It was a cloudy morning, when me and my 2 friends saw a wierd object in the sky. We were walking to the Library when we saw it. The craft seemed to shine as it moved by. The craft was oval shaped and was moving faster than an air plane. After 20 seconds the craft disapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request additional reports from this group of students.

I saw it.;2003-12-13 01:30:00;2-3 seconds;I know this is going to sound sort of weird, because for once I have never thought that I would see something like this ever in my life. In truth, I didn't believe that there was no such thing as UFOs, not until today. I was on my way home after meeting with my friends in a nearby cafe. There was rarely any cars at the moment. Temperature was 48 degrees F. The sky was very dark, clear, and stars were visible. When I was approaching my intersection to make a left, I saw it. On the top right corner of my frontal car window, an round shaped, bright light greenish light suddenly caught my eye. I stopped my car in the middle of the street and looked at it. It started to get brighter and then it warped out leaving a trail of the same exact color for about half a second and vanished, as if nothing was there. After it disappeared, I thought about many things for a moment. It could've been an airplane, a helicopter, fireworks, or something.. it was NOTHING LIKE IT. Then, my whole body started to get goosebumps and my eyes with tears. I froze right there, in the middle of the street for a good 30 seconds. I once saw the UFO sighting shows in television before. It looked exactly like it. If whoever reads this gives me video clips of different sightings, I might be able to pinpoint something similar to what I actually saw. I know other people will not believe me. I called some of my friends that were awake and some didn't even believe me! This is the first time I ever write this type of report ever in my life, but this event cannot pass without notice. It will be treasured inside me for the rest of my life. I'm a little shocked and frightened at the same time at the moment, but now I know that we are not alone in this universe. I hope other non believers will eventually see what I have seen and feel the same way as I do now.  If i had a camera, I would've took a picture of it, but even though if I had one, I couldn't, because the duration of the event was too short.  *Call me if there is something that is related to my sighting and your investigation.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689

It moved to the south and then disappeared One week before this date I saw an oval white light in the sky and I went to get my roommate.  Once we both care out to see it was gone.  On December 26th 2019, I saw the exact same shape in the exact same spot.  I went to get my roommate again and we both saw it.  It looked about a mile away.  None of us could look directly at it, it was white and extremely bright.  After about 5 minutes the craft moved around a bit and then disappeared.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689
