Moving from south to north into the LAX flight pattern.  Light in color like off white (egg shell) hard to tell due to night time.  Seemed like it was just gliding.  Wingspan was at least 100 feet.  1/2 mile to a 3/4 mile high.  Seemed like a glider with just the wings without the fuselage or tail.  It was not the stealth fighter as the wings were very thin width wise and the stealth makes quite a lot of noise which this did not.;33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689

UFO above seven eleven  w/ fast lights;2009-12-20 21:00:00;8-10 minutes;ufo above seven eleven  w/ fast lights I just finished with wrestling practice and i was walking home.  I saw a little group of people running so I ran to check it out.  The UFO was right above a seven eleven. it had lights that revolved around it really fast diagonally, vertically and horizontally.afterwards it just flew off slowly over this bridge and disappeared. almost as if it didn't care if anyone was watching.  I have seen many others around my area but not like this one.  I honestly believe something is going on over here because me and my friend has seen numerous of them in our area and for a long duration of time.  This is NOT a joke or hoax.  I will be reporting plenty more of events. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));33.8827326460475;-117.911202863689
