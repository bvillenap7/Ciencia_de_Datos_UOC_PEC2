Unbelievably beautiful spatial anomaly;1971-04-03 20:00:00;30 Minutes;Unbelievably beautiful spatial anomaly My father and I were driving over a ridge top just at dusk when we saw the phenomenon. The object was at the far right of our view and was moving majestically from right to left horizontally at about half the speed of a satellite - VERY slowly. The object itself was about three times the size and brightness of Venus on a clear night. There were maybe 13 ‘rays’ coming from the object that spanned approximately 25 degrees of arc (it was huge, anyway I couldn’t cover it with both hands at arms length) and were equal in brightness to the object, uniform in thickness and length, and absolutely ‘steady’. In other words, they did not ‘waver, change color, or vary in any way until the object ‘exploded’. It was as if someone were slowly moving a static transparency across the night sky. Well, we were amazed! I quickly found a turn-out, stopped the car, and my father and I got out and sat on the hood of the car to watch it. As objective as I’ve tried to be it’s impossible for me to judge the time we sat there watching this. I have to say maybe 20, even 30 minutes, although it felt much longer. After it had crossed 2/3 of the sky, it ‘exploded’. I say exploded, but I really don’t know what it did, it was so beautiful and inexplicable. Suddenly the ‘rays’ disappeared like a light switch being turned off at the same moment a ‘ring’ of fuzzy light expanded rapidly from the object (which at that moment retained it’s size and brilliance) and, in about 2 seconds time, vanished out of sight over the horizons and into space. This ‘ring’ lost about half of its intensity during this expansion. Then, VERY slowly, like the unfolding of a six petaled flower, the object itself began to expand: As it expanded, in perfect symmetry, it rotated very slowly. This phase of the experience lasted maybe 5-10 minutes. It continued to rotate and expand in graceful majesty, slowly growing dimmer and dimmer. By this point the ‘lines’ of the ‘flower’ were becoming fuzzier and less distinct. Until it filled the entire sky from horizon to horizon, although by this time it was extremely dim, like a fog or vapor, with the ‘lines’ only barely visible. And then it was gone. What was it? I don’t know. It felt somehow ‘alive’ to me… like the creature in the first Star Trek: Next Generation pilot movie. It didn’t seem like a ‘craft’ exploding because of the perfect symmetry. The speed with which it was moving gives me the feeling it was quite distant, above orbital range, perhaps as far as lunar orbit, but I am no physicist. The local newspaper reported on it the next day, and I suppose many people saw it, although I’ve never spoken to anyone who did. They said it was a Soviet rocket stage re-entering the atmosphere. Maybe it was, but I don’t believe it. I’ve seen these re-entries, and they resemble large meteorites, flaming and breaking apart and moving quite a bit more swiftly across the sky. I just don’t know.

A pale red light was seen to my left above a tree line next to a creek. This object caught my attention immediately, because an airplane wouldn't be flying that close near a residential area.I found a parking spot 150 yards up the road, and got out to observe the object. It was only one pale red light that maybe twice faded to a dim and then returned to it's original brightness. There was a telephone pole right next to the object, so my girlfriend & I could actually observe the object's ascent to approx. 1500 feet. As it ascended, it swayed very slighty to one side & back to the other. It reminded me  of a Chinese Lantern, as it was a pale red color and the swaying it did. It proceded to move towards our direction after about 10 minutes of ascending. It was NOT an airplane or any conventional aircraft I have ever seen in a night-time setting. The light made no noise. The evening was calm & crystal clear that night. As it proceded towards us, I became a little nervous, and watched it move to the south-east (in our direction), so I decided I had seen enough (40* F outside), but when I looked back in the object's general direction 5 minutes later, it was gone. This was my first sighting that I can recall in my life. There were no reports in the paper or on the radio the following day.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Strange, projectile-firing light over northern california.;1998-12-10 18:27:00;70 seconds;Strange, projectile-firing light over northern california. I am a college student majoring in computer science here in the Northern California Bay Area. At 6:27 this evening, as I sat studying in my room, I glanced out my window and noticed an unusually bright light moving rapidly across the sky, heading north west. Thinking it might be something unusual, such as a satellite, meteor, or maybe the space shuttle, I went outside for a better look. I followed it closely as it moved the night sky. It made no sound, had no flashing running lights of any sort, and appeared to be at a very high altitude. I was about to go in, thinking it was probably a satellite, when it began to fire what I can only describe as missiles or rockets! I could not believe my eyes! This thing let loose seven bright projectiles which traveled away from it and down, leaving a bright tracer. There was a pause between each one. Certain it was not a meteor breaking up, I phoned the coast guard, local air traffic control tower, and the local paper, but no one else had reported a similar sighting.  I have never seen anything like this before, and would like to know if anyone else on the West coast witnessed this. Strange;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
A bright lit flying object, with trailing blue/green streak, bright light instant vaporized, leaving blue/green streak for 20 minutes.;2000-07-07 21:30:00;30 seconds;((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Vandenberg AFB.  PD)) A bright lit flying object, with trailing blue/green streak, bright light instant vaporized, leaving blue/green streak for 20 minutes. I looked up at the bright flying vessel (I thought it was some kind of aircraft), and I kept staring at it because the emissions coming off of it were unlike anything I had ever seen.  The white steam or discharge was trailing it with a giant blue/green streak trailing straight behind it.  The white discharge was shaped like an arrow in front of the blue/green streak.  Then the bright light vaporized, leaving behind a pronounced blue/green streak that lasted for 20 minutes. I was with a friend who saw the whole thing with me.  Any ideas about how I might find out if anyone else saw it? I am 43 years old, business owner with two children, 18 years and 21 years old.  I have never seen a UFO before.  This is my first!   Very exciting!;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

At about 2200 hours, I was the passenger and spotted a greenish object streaking across the sky at about 2 o'clock position. I have to guess the view angle at about 15 degrees from my position. It was viewable to about 20-25 degrees to the southeast. I checked a map and that is the approximate direction to Modesto from our position as we were heading east. The object was going from west to east at a high velocity as it was viewable for only one second. My initial thought that it was a meteor but it was quite large, about a quarter of a fingernail held at arm's length. The driver of the truck also noted it and we both wondered what the hell it was. It was hard to determine the shape as it was somewhat blurred, either there was haze in the sky or it was very far away. (This may be the same object reported in Ceres, CA)The location of Forestville, CA in Coordinates, is 122W53.5 38N28.4 Our position was about 3 miles south/southeast of that point.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Blue spherical light moving in a corkscrew spiral, very fast with no sound, moving west in Northern California.;2001-07-26 01:15:00;5 seconds;Blue spherical light moving in a corkscrew spiral, very fast with no sound, moving west in Northern California. It was a warm night so we had the shades up and windows open, hoping to catch a breeze from outside. I woke up to use the bathroom and walked into the bathroom facing the window, as I entered the bathroom a bright bluish light outside my window, caught my eye.  I moved toward the window without turning on the light and watched as the spherical blue light moved in a spiral motion heading west directly toward me, moving very quickly.  It continued it's corkscrew spiral right over my house, I heard no sound or engine noise, just a woosh of air as it went right over the roof tops.  I moved to the window in my bedroom but it was gone.  The light seemed to strobe in unison with the corkscrew spiral motion but this could have been an optical illusion due to it's motion.  As a former Marine Aviation Ordinanceman I can tell you that the US Military does NOT have anything that can fly like that.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
bright light - high altitude crossing sky at high velocity, (no collision beacons).;2004-01-23 19:45:00;5 minutes;bright light - high altitude crossing sky at high velocity, (no collision beacons). A co-worker and I were standing outside the parking lot after a shift at work when we sighted an odd object crossing the sky.  The object crossed the horizon within 3-5 minutes.  I initially noticed the object when it was low on the horizon and was struck by its high velocity.  I initially thought it was a satellite.  The object appeared as a bright light (no collision beacons), as it passed overhead on a southwest to northeast course the object became brighter as it moved farther east.  A few minutes later, my co-worker and I were able to compare the object to other aircraft in the sky.  The object was 10X brighter ,5X higher and 4-5X faster than the propeller driven craft that were in the sky nearby.  I have never seen craft travel that quickly at that altitude and never appear that bright.  The object was much brighter and lower in the sky than any satellite that I have observed.  It appeared to be at the general altitude that airliners cruise at.  My initial impression was that of a government test aircraft and it's vector would have brought it near Beale AFB in Marysville, 100Mi. East. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The tiny dots were to the west of an old contrail. I got my binoculars and a digital camera. My wife was thr first to see one of the objects in the binoculars. It was red and white, irregular shape, and appeared to be tumbling about very high up. I also witnessed this with the binoculars. It's position relative to the contrail did not change appreciably. I lost sight of the other object right away. I took several digital photos in the area where I saw the object and one of them captured it, although the resolution is poor. After about 15 minutes I lost sight of this object too. There were no noises, lights or color changes.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

A light, that looked like a very bright star zipped up where I could see it above a neighbors rooftop, however it looked as though it was pretty far away, like an airplane.  It went slowly higher in the Eastern sky for about 10-15 minutes, and I woke up my daughter to see it.  It slowly went east bound and disappeared out of view.  I figred it must have been a sattelight, or something like that, but then it came back!  It hung around for a while, but then I fell back asleep after watching it for about 15 minutes.

Saw a very bright light on an unusual course moving at relatively low altitude without making a sound.;2005-08-01 22:15:00;1 minute;Saw a very bright light on an unusual course moving at relatively low altitude without making a sound. While walking my dog before going to bed, I noticed a bright light that was rapidly approaching from the east heading in a north-westerly direction. The elevation at that point was about 30 degree. The light was a bright yellowish-white that was brighter and larger than the ISS when it is directly overhead. There was a small strobe light to the lower right of the larger light slightly detached, that was flashing in about 1 second intervals. The motion of the light was smooth like the ISS but it was going more than twice as fast as the typical speed of the ISS.  The light moved along a left-handed long sweeping turn. When it passed to the north of my position, it was at an elevation of about 70 degrees. It continued to a point at about 50 degree elevation in the north-west. At that point, the craft must have made a course correction by making a smooth but easily noticeable turn to the south-west. As it came out of this turn, the light increased in brightness by a factor of three or four for about 2 to 3 seconds. It was by far the brightest light in the sky at that moment. It then went briefly very dim for about 2 seconds as if something structural was obscuring the light source but I could still see the glow of the light behind it. It then brightened again for about 2 seconds to the intensity it had been when it passed to the north of me. The light and even the glow then totally disappeared and all I could see the was the strobe plus a fainter strobe nearby that was about 1/2 second out of synch with the first strobe. When they receded, the strobes has a reddish hue. I was able to follow them until the object disappeared over the roof of a house heading due south. The elevation was then about 30 degrees.  The entire affair from first seeing it and then losing sight of it lasted no more than one minute. There was absolutely no sound, even when it made the turn south and it seemed fairly close at that point. There may have been other, fainter lights but I could not clearly see them because I was in an area where there were several bright street lights.  When I got home, I checked Heavens Above and found that the ISS will not be visible in my area until August 7th. Envisat was scheduled to be visible about 15 minutes after my observation at a trajectory SE50-ENE72-N10 at a maximum magnitude of 2.9 which is about as bright as Envisat gets. I have seen it many times and there was no comparision to the light I saw. The light I saw was at least a minus 4 or brighter. No other satellites were listed as being visible to me at that time. I have no idea what I saw. If it was a conventional jet, I should have heard a sound, since it didn't seem to be very high in altitude. This fact was confirmed by the ease with which I could follow the strobes to such a low elevation.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Meteor-like object seen while watching an Iridium flare.;2007-04-28 22:06:00;2 sec;Meteor-like object seen while watching an Iridium flare. According to Heavens Above, a very bright (-8 magnitude) flare from Iridium 49 was visible from my location. It was to be seen in the ENE at 39 degrees elecation, starting at 22:06:06. The distance of the flare center from my location was 2.7 km.  The flare (a reflection of the sun) came right on time, but because my eyes were fixed on a spot a little higher up and a little further north, I missed the beginning of the flare. I did catch it in the corner of my eye and looked directly at it when it was at its brightest. The flare was quite spectacular but it faded quickly. The duration of the flare was no more than 2 to 3 seconds.  Less than 2 seconds after the flare had faded from view, a bright and very fast moving light came from the north, heading south. It flew horizontally less than 5 degrees below where the flare had been. I saw the moving light first in that location and followed it until it was obscured by a tree. The entire event lasted no more than 2 seconds.  The object (light) had the general appearance of a meteor but it looked like no meteor I had ever seen and I have seen my share of them. Besides, meteors do not fly parallel to the ground. The head was about the diameter of three Jupiters (or about 2 arc minutes in angular size. The front was convex and the back was concave. Two very  thin streamers came off the end points on the concave end. The color of the light was white with a yellowish tint. It remained steady in intensity over the brief duration.  I estimated the angular distance between the location of the Iridium flare (and the appearance of the object) and where the tree blocked the object as about 45 degrees. The object traversed that distance in 1.5 seconds. These facts give the object an angular speed of 30 degrees per second. That it ten times faster than the Space Shuttle flying over CA for a landing in FL, and 60 times faster than the angular speed of the ISS (International Space Station) when it passes overhead.  The brief duration of my observation leaves me with the impression that the object was not at a very high altitude, although I have no facts to support that impression. If the object was as low as 10 000 feet, my calculations show that it flew at a speed of 1.26 miles/second, or more than 4500 miles/hour. If it was at any higher altitude, its speed would have been proportionately faster.  Then there is the element of coincidence that I find difficult to accept. How can two visually spectacular but otherwise totally unrelated events occur in the same patch of sky at essentially the same time. What are the odd??  What did I see. Can someone enlighten me?;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

However, as I neared my home I noticed it was still there and still glowing.  I stopped my car and watched it. It was not moving as I would expect from an airplane.  It was hovering stationary and was changing in brightness.  It got very bright, then would dim a little, but it did not move.  I watched for a few minutes and then just below and to the right of it, a second bright white object appeared.

Five or six hovering lights formed into a triangle in the sky in Santa Rosa, California.;2009-04-04 23:45:00;1 1/2 minute;Five or six hovering lights formed into a triangle in the sky in Santa Rosa, California. My girlfriend and I were driving and came into the intersection of College Ave and Humboldt in Santa Rosa, CA, and noticed some bright lights in the sky. It was 10:45 PM. I felt so elated that I called a friend and the cell phone call recorded the time. At first, due to all the light in the intersection, we did not think much of it. As we drove closer and came into a darker area we noticed five and six bright lights formed into a triangle shape in the sky (we were surrounded by trees and, therefore, the visibility was slightly impaired nevertheless, we could clearly see the triangle formation) . They were slightly swerving into each other but essentially maintained the triangle shape. I asked my girlfriend to stop the car and I got out to get a clearer look at this unusual phenomenon. As I stood there, all of the bright points of light disappeared, except one. They zoomed out at an unimaginable speed leaving no trace whatsoever. The bright point of light which remained did so for another 20-30 seconds, and then slightly dimmed and suddenly it was gone. The color of these lights was a blend of red and orange and they were very bright relative to the surrounding stars. These bright lights might have been hovering at 500 feet or more it was hard to tell the exact altitude and distance, but they were near enough for us to see what was taking place. The two of us were pretty baffled and amazed but we were convinced that we had witnessed a UFO, and I employ this term in the strict sense of the word as in Unidentified Flying Object.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

We came into the tent around midnight or 12:30 and my brother pointed out the light in the sky and said that light was here last time we came in the tent (which had been about 2 hours earlier).  So we layed down in the tent and watched the light for over an hour and a half, and during that time the light seemed like it just hovered way up in the sky.  We watched it make distingtive shapes in the sky but no matter what shape it made or direction it flew it always went back to the same spot in the sky.  Later on while still watching it we turned on a lantern in the tent and the only light visible in the sky was the one we had been watching.  And eventully the light would get dim then bright and it did that for a little while.  We looked away for a minute and when we looked back up it was gone.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

The kids came in and made the parents go outside and look.  We looked to the north just above the neighbor's house who live directly behind us.  We saw what looked like a wide blue line that flickered.  You could see it better with your peripheral vision.  The light seemed to move side to side and up and down but hover in the same general area.  I grabbed my video camera and it wouldn't pick up the lights.  I then grabbed my still camera with a telephoto lens and was shocked to see on the view screen 3 distinct blue lights.  I then took a few pictures and went back to finish our poker game, while my son continued to take more pictures.

10 UFOs over Santa Rosa, California (six in a big dipper formation, four in a half circle);2009-10-24 23:20:00;20+ minutes;10 UFOs over Santa Rosa, California (six in a big dipper formation, four in a half circle) I had trouble falling asleep on Saturday, October 24, 2009, and so around 11:30 pm, I just started looking up at the stars outside my bedroom window like I do occasionally whenever I can’t sleep. This night was different however, because I immediately noticed bright lights in the sky in an arrangement similar to the big dipper. My window faces east, so I was looking that direction. This link video footage of exactly what I saw, with a few minor differences:  http://www.disclose.tv/action/viewvideo/7790/UFO_RUSSIA__SUMMER_2008_NEWS_BIG_DIPPER_FORMATION/   Like the formation in the video, the formation I saw had only two objects forming the handle, except the formation I saw had the handle tilted diagonally upward. Also, the formation I saw was staying pretty much stationary, with the exception of one of the objects (the lower object in the dipper handle which was sort of swaying back and forth, not in a dramatic way but ever so slightly, and it was this that caught my eye) and the only other difference is that the formation in the video seems to be more tightly packed in, and the formation I saw was a bit more spread out. All the objects I saw were dimming in and out, and the object that was swaying would occasionally flash a dark red. A lot of things I witnessed are similar to the video like the altitude, the brightness and coloration, size, and of course, the formation itself. Off to the right of the dipper formation, were four objects in no particular order or formation that slowly moved together to form a crescent shape or half circle. During this time, the dipper formation stayed in place, dimming in and out. Eventually, the object at the bottom of the crescent began to flash wildly, first in it’s “natural” color, then in dark red and blue. It struck me as sort of like a morse code, or signal of some kind, and I assume it was “communicating” to the dipper formation, at which point I got spooked and went downstairs to make coffee as this was all a bit too much for me to handle. I’ve always been a skeptic about UFOs and this has pretty much shaken up my whole world view. I can no longer deny that UFOs exist. In the video link I provided, it appears that formation is regrouping into separate formations, ! and I can only assume that is the activity that I was witnessing, but I didn’t stay to witness the whole incident because I was pretty shaken, so I can’t say what eventually happened. When I worked up the courage to come back up to my bedroom and have a look out the window about a half hour later, both the dipper formation and half circle formation had gone, nowhere to be found.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

2 bright orange lights over Santa Rosa Ca.;2012-06-23 23:15:00;5 minutes;2 bright orange lights over Santa Rosa Ca. June 23, 2012   My husband and I were walking our dogs tonight in Santa Rosa California, as we do every night at a school  5 miles west of town.  At around 11:15 I was looking at the sky and noticed an unusually bright orange light approaching us from the south.  I called to my husband to look and said “That’s not a plane is it?”  It kept getting higher and closer and then changed direction and quickly started going to the east where it then disappeared. A few  minutes later we both saw another very large, bright orange light low coming up from  the horizon in the west.   It seemed to come towards us (we were east of it) and then rapidly ascended to the east at  the same location where we saw the other one and  disappeared also.  They both seemed to have some sort of pulsing movement in the light. There was no sound at all.  When we saw the 2nd one I had an urge to hide as I thought it was coming toward us but it went up instead. 2 nights ago at the same place, probably more around 11:00pm, we also saw what we thought was a satellite moving rapidly across the sky from south to north (we are familiar with satellites and the space station moving across the sky as well as what planes and helicopters look like)  as we were watching,  It gave a big bright flash of white light and was gone!  I don’t know what the heck is going on in the sky here right now but I’m keeping my eyes open and my wits about me!;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Yellow Orange lights over West Sonoma County CA;2012-06-23 23:16:00;5 minutes;Yellow Orange lights over West Sonoma County CA On Saturday, June 23, 2012 at roughly 11:16 P.M.  My wife and I were walking our dogs in a field a couple miles West of Santa Rosa.  My wife had stopped to watch the sky and called for me to look at something. She asked if an object moving across the sky was a jet or not.  She had been watching it for quite a while before mentioning it to me. What I saw was a light much too large to be a high flying aircraft.  Rather than being a small pinpoint, it was maybe the equivalent of 1/8-1/4 at arms length. It was South and slightly West of us heading roughly East.  I would estimate it was about 25-30 degrees from the horizon.  I assumed it to be an aircraft at first because there is an air traffic lane that comes in off the ocean about due west. The object was a strange color somewhat like a high pressure sodium light.  The intensity sort of undulated, but we could see no strobes.  There was no sound.  The other odd thing was the flight path. It didn't seem to travel in a smooth straight trajectory.  It sort of bobbled around on it's path.  Also, it climbed steadily and got smaller and smaller until we could no longer see it.  It disappeared about 45-50 degrees from the horizon and about Southeast of us. Approximately two minutes later, my wife spoke out about another one.  This one was farther West, when I saw it than the previous object, and much lower.  Lower to the point I thought it might have just taken off from a nearby airport, but there are no airports West of Santa Rosa.  We observed this light follow a similar path to the Southwest climbing rapidly in an undulating trajectory until it disappeared in the same spot as the first one.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
UFO sighting in Santa Rosa, California.;2013-12-18 23:40:00;30 seconds;UFO sighting in Santa Rosa, California. UFO SIGHTING At approximately 2340 hours, I was heading east on College Ave (on way to grocery store). Suddenly a light appeared, like a bright shooting star. It fell quickly across the sky. But it never disappeared. It kept going, and going. I’m thinking:  When is this going to disappear?  But it moved like it was being driven, like an airliner that is going to crash because it is moving too quickly to land safely. To listen for the crash, I rolled down my window. It got so low to the ground my view was blocked by buildings. Just before it would have gone out of view, it changed direction and flew in a straight line, no longer falling. The direction change was an L pattern, parallel to the ground. It flew away from me, same direction I was heading, and disappeared. (After it was gone, I watched an airplane that had been in the sky the entire time,  moving at a snail’s pace and dim compared to the light).;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

She called my family tonight to tell us that the light was back and we were surprised to see a very bright blinking star, followed by a vey loud machine like noise coming from that direction.

There is no way there were a plane or satellite.  There was zero sounds or noises. The speeds were unbelievably fast. We saw one light coming down were we were gathered.  It was actually completely metallic chrome silver but in a spherical shape. We all could see what look like humans wearing plain colored clothing but they looked too perfect and they were smiling at us.  We all think they were aliens.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

At first we thought we were seeing the starlink satellites but they were very far up in the atmosphere. They were sometimes in parallel rows and not in a straight line. They would appear at a certain point and disappear around another point. This went on for over 15 minutes. The sky suddenly became hazy in their flight path. We stayed out quite late but the sky didnt clear back up. Its very concerning because there were so many of them for so long. Where were they going?;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
