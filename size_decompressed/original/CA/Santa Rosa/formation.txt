Diamond formation, two red, two green lights.;2013-12-27 21:12:00;8 seconds;Diamond formation, two red, two green lights I looked up because I got a weird feeling.  That being watched feeling.  When I looked up, I saw what appeared to be a square, or diamond formation shape.  Two bright red lights, two bright green.  After I had stared for approx 6-8 seconds, the lights flashed, and it SPED away.  This was NOT a normal speed. It was FAST.  It was defiantly very low too.  Too low for normal aircrafts to fly.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Bright orange lights hovering around the moon and horizon, then rising up and disappearing;2017-01-13 20:25:00;10 minutes;Bright orange lights hovering around the moon and horizon, then rising up and disappearing When I was coming home from the store, I saw bright orange lights, almost like stars, floating in the sky. Six of them were near the horizon almost behind the mountains and dimmer than the others, seven were to the right of the moon and almost looked like the little dipper but when two of them drifted further away it was very apparent that they were not stars.  Three were to the left of the moon, one faded before the rest did but one was flashing faintly. Five more were directly above in the sky. After about 5 minutes, they all began to rise and eventually drifted up and faded until they were no longer visible. When I got home, several of my neighbors said they saw the lights too and couldn't make out what they were.  I also called a friend in another part of town and she said she saw them as well, but further north meaning they were fairly close to the ground.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
20 or more magenta-colored lights in the sky moving in formation, yet independently.;2017-01-13 20:45:00;5 minutes;20 or more magenta colored lights in the sky moving in formation, yet independently. 20 or more round, magenta colored objects.  Seen from Howarth Park looking northeast. The magenta lights were moving independently and all moving north.  Some appeared to be dimming in brightness.  Over the course of 2-3 minutes, all 20+ of them disappeared.  A separate observer filmed the sighting and claims that near the bottom of the formation, there was a bright wisping white circle.  There appeared to be 3-4 man made lights approaching the magenta lights;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
