I was about a block away from the building I worked in when I notice  something flying above the building it was round and dark and moving very slowly sometimes stopping, when I got closer I relized the thing I saw was black and metallic.(it look like an eight ball) I did not say anything to my friend the whole time this was going on I wish I did. I was not sure of what I was looking at.The sun reflected off the craft as it did the cars in the parking lot,it was about forty feet above the building and the size of a car I think it was looking for something or somebody it kept going back and forth from over the building to parking lot and then after about four minutes it was gone.

Orange circular object moved quickly to NE and was followed almost to the horizon.;2004-05-14 21:40:00;45 sec;Orange circular object moved quickly to NE and was followed almost to the horizon. While walking my dog, noticed directly overhead a moving yellow-orange circular object that looked like Jupiter but was 50% larger. Jupiter was nearby, a little more to the west, and just below the constellation of Leo. This moving object headed straight NE at a speed that convinced me that it had to be a satellite. It had the same deliberate and steady motion. I was able to follow it to within a few degrees above the NE horizon. As it receded, it not only became smaller but also decidedly more orange. Since it still had considerable angular speed when it approached the horizon, it convinced me that it was following the earth in a circular orbit. Based on these observations, I would have to conclude that I had seen an unknown satellite. What puzzles me though is the fact that about 1.5 hours after sunset, it should have blinked out at an elevation of about 22.5 degress as it entered the Earth's shadow. It did not do that and I could follow it almost to the horizon to within about 2 degrees.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

Hello, and thanks so much for your work. I always listen to your reports on C2C.;2014-07-09 00:00:00;20 minutes;Hello, and thanks so much for your work.  I always listen to your reports on C2C. Technically this is ufo, but I don’t know if it was ‘one of our’s. About a month ago (this is 8/11/14), I saw an object in the sky that caught my attention.  We live in Santa Rosa, CA, and about 3 miles from the airport.  It was about 9:00 pm, the sky was dark, no fog.   I noticed out of my second story window that there was an object and I thought it was an airplane coming straight on to the airport.  But it wasn’t moving at all, and there was only one light.  I laughed at myself, thinking ‘oh sure, you just want to see a ufo.  I got my husband to look at it.  I kept track of it for about 20 minutes- it’s possible that it moved a tiny bit, but when you are staring at something like that you can be fooled, so I don’t know.  It also seemed to maybe have some periodic flickering colors on the right side. For those 20 minutes it did not change course.  When I went to bed it was still there, same place. It was south from here, very small.  San Francisco is 50 miles from here, and I supposed it could be in that direction.  I don’t know if I could actually see that far, but it was a dark cloudless night and the object, although very small, was bright.   I figured the angle was about 50 degrees up from the ground where I was. Now here is a funny thing. My sister lives about 50 miles south of San Francisco in the area of San Jose.  I never mentioned this siting to her (I actually pretty much forgot about it). About two weeks ago we were talking and, guess what, she saw the same thing! But hers was a few weeks after my siting. I did not say anything as she was relating it to me I put my hand over my mouth and let her finish talking about it, and then told her. What a shock!  She saw hers later than mine, more about 11:00pm. And hers was somewhere over the Lockheed area (I think a little east from her). She watched hers for about 10 minutes- it did not move. Other than the time and date, and a little more east from her place, it was exactly the same description! Today we were talking about this and I decided to write you. We decided it must be a drone. Do you know?? I don’t like the idea of drones lurking in the sky any more than an ET.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

I see many aircraft pass over regularly because I live near the Santa Rosa airport.  I see aircraft everyday and every night.   Tonight, while sitting in my hot tub, I was looking at the sky and I saw an object like nothing I have seen before.  It followed no regular flight pattern.  It appeared to be moving in a South/West direction.   The craft was round and looked like two plates stacked on top of each other.  There was a round pattern of lights on the bottom plate of the craft.  It appeared to move slowly, but within ten seconds I could no longer see it at all.   I jumped out of the tub and hollered at my wife to look up at it, but she was frightened by the tone of my voice and by my excitement and would not look up, so she do not see it, but we are both still shaken by the experience.   We are both very interested to know if any other such sightings occurred in this a! rea around the same time this evening.   We will look at the reported sightings report regularly and are sorry that we are not allowed to provide our contact info.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
I am a 65 year old female domestic engineer.;2015-05-06 23:30:00;5 minutes;I am a 65 year old female domestic engineer. On the night of May 6, 2015 my husband and I went to bed at 21:00. At 23:25 I woke up to go to the bathroom.  Before returning to bed, I pulled the blind away from the window to adjust the windows opening and noticed out in the Northwest just above the horizon very bright glowing orange circular light.  I quickly went to the living room to get the binoculars so I could get a better look.  Viewing the light through the binoculars I saw that the bright glowing orange circular light was pulsing, and when it pulsed, it would turn to a darker orange, then back to the light orange.  It was very beautiful. While watching the glowing orange circular light for about 3 minutes, it started to move backward until out of sight. I didn't wake my husband because I didn't want to miss anything.  I told him next time I would wake him up if it happens again. :)   It sure was awesome to witness!;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
White luminous small moon like object traversed daytime sky E to W for about 1.5 hours.;2015-05-29 16:00:00;1.5 hours;White luminous small moon like object traversed daytime sky E to W for about 1.5 hours, We observed a luminous white circular object fly slowly overhead for about 1 1/2 hours. Total time was from about 15:45- 17:15.  It looked like a small moon.  It moved very slowly from East to West.  We were able to watch it through binoculars but could not make out any details or dimension.   Our sighting was verified by a friend who was about 5 miles to the west of us.  It was hard to tell how high up it was, but it seemed like many thousand feet as we could both see it at the same time and it appeared generally overhead. Because of the distance, we have no idea of the size.  It never appeared to vary its course, just slow and steady in a straight line.  As it got farther away (up and away?)  It looked like a very bright star/planet.  Much brighter than Venus.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

My son and I were playing catch, around 1pm, when in the sky above his head, I noticed a large white dot.  I was facing northeast.  I didn't think much of it at first but when it hadn't moved at all over the course of a couple minutes I asked my son his thoughts.   He went and got son binoculars.  I couldn't believe my eyes!  It was a transparent round blob with the consistency of a clear jellyfish.  In a way it resembled a hoop.  The entire outside edge of the hoop was a light.  It stayed lit but would blink periodically!   I didn't tell my son what I was seeing.  I ask him to take a look and tell me what he saw.  He explained seeing the same exact same thing I was seeing.  It sat stationary for 8 minutes or so the watched it slowly float to the west out of sight.  The whole thing lasted 10 minutes or so.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
