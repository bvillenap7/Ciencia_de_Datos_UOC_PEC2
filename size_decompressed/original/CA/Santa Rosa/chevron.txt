This happened 22 years ago, but it was very frightening and remains vivid in my mind.  While driving down a fairly busy street(now 4 lanes), a friend and I (both 17) noticed a very large black boomerang shaped object rapidly approaching. At first, we both thought it was a plane about to crash, but then it just stopped in mid air and hovered less than 100 ft. over a house, giving off a low humming sound. My friend was driving, and it scared us so badly she just stopped her car right in the middle of the street.  We were so scared that we could not speak or move, we just sat there staring at this huge object with approx. 8 lights around its bottom perimeter.  I just kept wondering why there was not anybody else on that street at that time, there was usually more traffic. It seemed like everything just stopped and stood still.  It then took off at an incredibly high speed until it disappeared in the Northern sky. Since we were only two blocks from my parent's house, we drove over there and ran inside crying because we were so scared. My mother called the local radio station to see if there were any other reports, but we were the only ones who reported it. It was such a strange thing that it left me asking did I just see that?;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Additional note to previous report same date Santa Rosa CA - Object was silent and did not bank in turns;2007-08-15 22:05:00;8 minutes;Additional note to previous report same date Santa Rosa CA - Object was silent and did not bank in turns Addtional notes to same previous report:  The object was low enough (perhaps between 2000 and 3000 feet) that I should have heard an engine, but I did not hear anything.  Also, this vehicle did not bank or lean into the direction of the turns it made. It stayed perfectly parallel to the earth while turning.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Triangle shaped bright lights with one red in the rear floated slowly southwest over Santa Rosa CA;2007-08-15 22:05:00;8 minutes;Triangle shaped bright lights with one red in the rear floated slowly southwest over Santa Rosa CA At 10:05 pm, Wednesday, 8-15-07, in the north Santa Rosa, California area, at 3925 Old Redwood Hwy, I noticed a bright light typical of approaching airplanes in the sky that was flying in an unusual direction from over the eastern hills and in my direction. I work a lot in the area and airplanes and helicopters never fly in that northeast to southwest direction, so I watched it. As it got overhead, the bright headlights turned out to be six white lights in a triangle shape on the underside. As it passed overhead, I also saw that the back two white lights, and also a red light in the rear middle, were blinking on and off. It was about the length and width of two fingers at arms reach and took about eight minutes to cover a distance of maybe five to seven miles. It seemed to move slowly, meandering in an S pattern, south, then west, then south again before I lost sight of it behind some trees. As it moved almost out of sight to the southwest I then noticed airplane headlights moving underneith it by about a distance of seven times the size of the object flying northward in a strait and normal direction of flight.  I am a California licensed private investigator and was on a surveillance at the time.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Chevron Craft Seen over Sonoma County 10/27/12 @ 9pm;2012-10-27 21:00:00;30 minutes;Chevron Craft Seen over Sonoma County 10/27/12 @ 9pm A chevron shaped object was seen slowly moving towards the Sonoma County Airport in a N/E direction from Santa Rosa (Fulton Road Neighborhood), neighbours all say the object was moving very slowly, and all confirmed it was chevron shaped object with three bright blinking red lights.  The craft maintained an altitide of approx 500ft. I was able to observe the object closer (300 yds) with a handheld single lense binocular (type used at gun range), I saw the outline of small rectangular windows on the craft, the object also looked as it was slanted at an angle (front being lower than the back).  As a private pilot I can confirm this had no identifying features (tail, tail number, directionational lights (green/red, etc...), the blinking red lights were very bright and blinkined out of sequence.  I wish I could of seen more it.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Fast moving chevron shape.;2018-04-08 22:00:00;5-8 seconds;Fast moving chevron shape My wife and I were on our back patio having a cigarette around 10pm, and i saw a commercial aircraft and i joked it's a ufo and we laughed.  But just then a chevron shape appeared coming north to south..bottom seemed illuminated.  No flashing lights.  Moving 4-5 times as fast as the jet...lower though maybe 10,000 ft.  This lasted 5-8 seconds and we have a big property with extensive views.   A little stunned we went back inside.  No sound.  Not the first time i have seen unusual craft. 4-5 other sightings.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
