They were on skateboards right in front of me.  As running I looked up and saw a very bright yellow light and about 3/4 of the way back another bright yellow light, you. could tell there was a wire in between then and it was about a 45 degree angle and it shot straight down...   I stopped straight in my track and started panicking.  Scariest thing I've ever seen.
