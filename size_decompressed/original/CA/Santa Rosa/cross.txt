It was a clear night with unlinited visability and a full Moon. At 23:55 I glanced out my back window, facing South, to view the full Moon I noticed out of the corner of my eye, what I thought at first was a brilliant Orange fireball.  I opened my back door and stepped onto my deck. I then noticed this was not a fireball, but an object moving from South to North. The object was appeared to be moving slowly and the object made no noise.  I estimate the object was 1000 to 2000 feet high. At this point in time I yelled for my wife and two kids, ages 19 and 16 to come view the object. By this time the object had passed over the house, so we all ran to the front of the house and stood on the deck and watched the object with binoculors.  The object, which was shaped like a cross, with orange lights, proceeded north. We all noticed when the object was approximately 2-5 miles away it stopped and hovered. The intensity if the orange glow was changing. It was glow very brightly and then the glow would almost dissapear. This occured 3 to four times. It then dropped a small object with the same color. It looked like a spark. The object then got very bright the brightest Orange yet. It then dropped another and larger object, whch again looked like a spark.  The object then just fadded out. looked like it winked out. I was still looking at the object with the binoculors as this occured. I could not see the object it was gone.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

Craft with 2 bright reddish pulsating lights, 5 small lights moved into set position in sky and stayed in that position for 15 m;2015-10-09 17:06:00;15 minutes;Craft with 2 bright reddish pulsating lights, 5 small lights moved into set position in sky and stayed in that position for 15 m Object appeared in the southeast sky of Santa Rosa, California.  I saw the object move into a stationary position in the sky and stay in that position for 15 minutes.   The object had two bright red-orange lights in the center of the craft that pulsated, and 5 smaller lights around the craft that were blinking in all four directions.   I saw distortion similar to heat waves around the craft.   After about 15 minutes, the craft started to travel south and faded away gradually over two minutes.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
