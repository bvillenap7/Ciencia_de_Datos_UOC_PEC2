It looked like a fireball.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-20 21:45:00;2 minutes;It looked like a fireball. It moved really slow any frist I thought it was that bag you light and floats in the sky.  Then I was, like no way, it started picking up speed and was gon fast then any aircraft I seen.  It was just floating like it was checking us out.  One of the people I was with thought it was a shooting star I was like know way it's floating marking no sound, I recorded it and you you tell we never seen my thing like this ever.  I set out every night staring at the stars I live next to a airport it was no such thing.  Kinda of creepy.
