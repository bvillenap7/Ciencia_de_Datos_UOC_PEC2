Travled very fast north to south. Lights on all points. Very little sound.;1999-03-11 23:55:00;4 seconds;Travled very fast north to south. Lights on all points. Very little sound. The triangle traveled from north to south very fast.  I have a view of the sky of about 100 degrees and I live in a rural area of Santa Rosa. There is an airport about 10 miles west of us, and every departing plane can be heard. The object had four lights, one on each point and one in the center. The lights were red and blue as the object came toward me and while receding were white. None of the lights were blinking. The object also made little noise.  It sounded more like wind rustling through trees than anything else. And the object was traveling very, very fast.  In comparison a Jumbo-jet coming from San Francisco International Airport takes about a minute to pass through to view alotted to me of the sky. This object went through that alotted view of 100 degrees of the night sky, in 3 seconds. ((SECOND REPORT FROM SAME SOURCE)) Going North to South. Three colored lights on points. Fourth color in center. No blinking lights of any kind. Going North to South. Three colored lights on points. Fourth color in center. No blinking lights of any kind. I'm a 25 year old male and have lived in Sonoma County for most of my life.  The trianglar shape had three lights, on on each point. The color shifted from red and blue while coming toward me, to white while receding.  There was also a fourth red light located in the center. The object traveled from the north toward the south (San Francisco) and was traveling fast.  In a view of about 100 degrees of the night sky, the object traveled that spanse in about 3 to 4 seconds.  There was very, very little noise.  The practically quiet noise (I live in a rural part of Santa Rosa and can hear planes depart from the local airport 10 miles away) was traveling about a second behind the object.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

I live near the Sonoma county airport, so I'm used to seeing low flying aircraft. This was not an aircraft. It was smaller than a jetliner but bigger than a commuterjet,flying at around 1500 feet at a high rate of speed(300mph?)NO sound at all! The object turned west and was gone as fast as it appeared.The sky was clear with a few scattered clouds,visibility was great.It was as if the object moved through the air effortlessly without friction. The info for this space is as above in the brief description, because it was a brief encounter. I am 30 years of age,a tradesman,and was out feeding my dogs when this event occured.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

Three bright orange triangular lights seen by elementary school teacher on Christmas Eve-Not Santa's sleigh.;2012-12-24 22:15:00;1-2 minutes;Three bright orange triangular lights seen by elementary school teacher on Christmas Eve-Not Santa's sleigh. Three Orange Triangular Lights in the Sky  It was Christmas Eve around 10:00 p.m.  It was a clear night with what looked to be a full moon.  The moon was shining bright with a huge white circular illumination.   I went outside into my backyard to let my dog out to go to the bathroom.  I sat down and waited for her.  I looked up and saw an orange triangular light in the sky the size of a small plane.  It was to the left of the moon’s light.  I thought it odd because it was bright orange.  I see planes overhead at night all the time and know that the planes’ lights blink white and orange.  This object did not, but it didn’t get my attention just yet.  I looked back down and continued to wait for my dog.  When I looked back up again the object had not passed overhead.  It was almost as if it had passed round again. When I continued to look up in the sky I now saw another orange triangular light.  I had never seen two “planes” so close together and thought it very strange.  As I continued to look, a third orange light came into view.  Now there were three orange lights in the sky in a triangular position.  It was at this time, I believed without a doubt, that I was seeing some sort of U.F.O.  I was scared but intrigued.   I stared at the three objects for a while and waited for them to pass overhead but they didn’t.  They just hovered.  The lights never blinked like planes and it was silent. Eventually, one light slowly moved to the right and out of my range of sight.  It was blocked by my patio umbrella.  I kept my eye on the two lights in front of me.  Then one of the lights slowly moved to the left.  By now the lights were getting smaller and shrinking into more of a circular orange light.  My eyes darted back and forth between the two smaller orange lights until they became white like stars and faded off. I just kept watching to see if the lights would come back but they didn’t.  The next thing I saw in the sky was a plane.  I watched it carefully to see what the lights would do.  I saw orange and white lights blinking, and of course I heard the sound. What I had seen were clearly not planes. I knew that what I had observed was extraordinary and told my family on Christmas day.  Everyone believed me and told me to post my sighting.  So here it is.  I am an elementary school teacher and not into U.F.O. stuff at all.  I truly believe what I saw was real and very strange.  I feel lucky to have seen it.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Small, silent, unlit triangle craft.;2013-11-02 20:10:00;15 seconds;Small, silent, unlit triangle craft My fiancé and I were lying on our backs in the back yard, looking at the stars.  We had just seen a really long, bright meteorite and were hoping for more.   All of a sudden she sat up and exclaimed, What IS that??  I looked in the direction she was looking, approximately West, and caught movement immediately with my peripheral vision.  As we watched it I went through a mental check list.  Too big and fast to be a bird. To fast and straight-flying to be a balloon.  Too silent and close to be an airplane.   As we watched it gliding silently past our rooftop, looking as though it was basically flying down the street we live on, it was blocking out stars and we could clearly see an outline created by the lights below reflecting off of what looked like a grey or silver underbelly.   I also had the impression that there may have been some barely-glowing lights along the trailing edge, perhaps four, but it was so dimly-lit that I can't be sure of that at all.  As I watched it disappear into the night I said, That was a ((word deleted)) UFO!!!   I asked my fiancé if she had been able to make out the shape of it.  She held her two thumbs and index fingers up and made the shape of an obtuse isosceles triangle, which was exactly what I had seen.   It was impossible to accurately gauge size, speed and distance, but our impression was that it was less than 500 yards away, probably 20-30ft from wingtip to wingtip, and moving 20-50mph.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
