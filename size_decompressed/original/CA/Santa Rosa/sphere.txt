Two very large glowing objects (one red, the other orange) stationary in the night sky, two appearances over about 15-20 minutes.;1989-07-26 22:00:00;10 minutes;Two very large glowing objects (one red, the other orange) stationary in the night sky, two appearances over about 15-20 minutes. I, and three friends, were partying at my house in Santa Rosa that night. My home was located on the western edge of the city. We were in one of the rooms facing the field (a cow pasture) adjacent to my home. Two spherical objects appeared over the field, probably a quarter mile away. They were, and I am guessing here, about 100 yards across (the red one) and 80 yards across (the orange one), definitely too large to be balloons and surely not balloons as balloons do not glow in the dark like that. The light was coming from inside these objects. We were simply awe-struck with comments like “Do you see that? What is that?” If we had out wits about us we would have found a camera but we could only look in awe. After about six minutes they disappeared. They did not fly away, they just disappeared. Another five minutes passed and they reappeared. They were not moving on either appearance, just hovering over the field probably 100 yards in the air. The night was pitch-black and these things were really bright. After another five minutes they disappeared and did not return although we stared in that direction for a long time. Now, here is the spooky part. Nineteen years later a friend of mine I had known only a couple years casually told me that he had seen some UFOs in 1989. I took a chance and told him “I will describe what you saw,” and I gave him the description I have just recorded above. His jaw dropped and he told me that was exactly what he had seen, only he had seen them while camping out at the beach, a distance of about 20 miles from where the four of us had seen these objects.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Floating translucent sphere floats right by;1990-06-01 11:00:00;3 minutes;Floating translucent sphere floats right by My attention was turned to the street when the horn on my old Plymouth starting honking on its own.  There was no security system on this old car.  The honking had stopped but I grabbed my keys to see why it was doing that.   As I approached the drivers side, I looked and saw a translucent sphere about the size of a basketball floating towards me from up the street.  It maintained a height if about 4' off the ground. I opened the car door, got in, and shut the door.  The sphere floated right by the window maybe 2' away.   I watched it follow the road around the corner through my side and rear view mirror.  I did not bother to follow it as I was quite perplexed.  It was translucent enough that it seemed to want to appear invisible.   I never really acted like I had seen it, and it seemed to act like I couldn't see it, as it never changed trajectory or speed.  I had just moved into this suburban neighborhood after spending a couple of years in a very remote location near Lake Shasta, where many other strange occurrences had occurred. Prior to this, I had never seen a 'UFO', nor have I since.   I have, however, seen and experienced many strange things not in the sky, but close to the ground.   I had never researched this until today, reading other similar accounts sends chills and makes me quite emotional. Very strange indeed.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
lots and lots of lights;2000-07-01 01:00:00;4-5 hours;lots and lots of lights To begin myself, my stepdad and a friend of mine were working in Santa Rosa on a commercial building and were sleeping on site.It was sunday evening/monday morning,we had just arrived there from a 5 hour drive,usually we slept in a van conversion but it was in the shop so we were in my compact car,it was still warm so my stepdad and friend decided to bed down outside,I was going to recline my seat and get a few hours before work started,I had my eye's closed for maybe 2 or 3 minutes when best as I can describe a feeling or a sense forced me to open my eyes and look to the north where I saw a star begin to dance in the sky, at first it was very slight and grew increasingly more pronounced,going from say where the sun is at 2 o'clock right down to the horizon,sometimes straight sometimes in a tight spiral,down then back up again for about five minutes,once i convinced myself I wasn't dreaming I woke my stepdad and friend,they looked and confirmed that I wasn't seeing things,but were more interested in sleeping so dozed off again.More curious by now I grabbed my binoculars and watched some more, but now there were 3 of them,they held a triangular shape which seemed solid now, and continued to dance,but now they or it was dancing evreywhere,up/down,side to side,spinning,blinking in and out of view at lightning speed,when I looked without the binos it appeared as a triangular shaped object,but with them I could see 3 seperate spheres,that didn't appear to be connected to each other(I could see stars between them).The spheres themselves were thirded,rows of lights in the middle third and the thirds were rotating or spinning..the top and bottom counterclockwise,the middle clockwise.Ok here it gets weirder,the sky was clear except in the northeast just above the foothills a small thundertorm was heading inland,from where we were you could see clear night sky and the storm heading up the mountains in the NE,with the binos I could see the middle row portions firing lights or somethin! g into t he storm clouds periodically,when they did this lightning would flash in the clouds,this went on for about an hour and then suddenly even more stars began to shoot in  from all directions of the sky to begin thier own dance,some stayed as single spheres others coalesced as more triangles,for about thirty minutes new ones would come in,it was quite a sight to behold let me tell you,i watched absolutely mesmerized for roughly 3 more hours at this time 2 of the triangular configurations kind of blended into a star of david shape and appeared to move right towards me when they got as near as I could say within 1000 ft above me and an 1/8th of mile away I could see what looked like a 5 to 6 thousand foot across object now and it was cloaked for lack of a better word, in a star field,that is to say when looking directly at it now I saw night sky ,but blurred somehow like a mirage effect,it hovered for a few minutes thenbegan to drift away slowly at first then faster then poof..gone,when it did that all the rest of the star which had been dancing in the background shot away in all directions as well.To conclude since seeing this my life has never been the same..i wont elaborate on that sorry.

Bright White/ blue sphere moved away into darkness of sky;2005-07-05 22:36:00;30 seconds;Bright White/ blue sphere moved away into darkness of sky Standing outside on unlit street, a bright white light appeared at about 40 degrees above horizon to the West. After a few seconds the object started moving nearly directly away (slightly upward) and shrank smaller until not visible. It moved straight into the darkness of the sky and did not return. As it moved parts of the object turned blue color in addition to the white light. Total duration was about 30 seconds.  There were two witnesses to event. It was a very clear July night in Sonoma county in northern California. Lots of stars were easily visible. Object initially appeared and looked many times larger than the brighest stars. As the object moved away its appearance shrunk to a pinpoint size and then was gone.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
A sight of an object, with 5 orange lights lined up horizontally, was seen hovering quietly between 500 to 1000 feet above houses.;2009-05-08 00:30:00;3-5 minutes;A sight of an object, with 5 orange lights lined up horizontally, was seen hovering quietly between 500 to 1000 feet above houses. The event started at approximately 12:30AM. I was driving on Stony Point Road from Rohnert Park to Santa Rosa. Near the intersection of Stony Point and Todd Road was when I saw an aircraft-like object quietly hovering in the sky. The object had 5 orange lights lined up horizontally: OOOOO.  The lights alternated in brightness and in color (from orange to yellow). My initial thought was why an aircraft would be flying so close to houses. I would estimate the object to be flying between 500 to 1000 feet above houses, at a speed of 60mph, and was a quarter of a mile ahead of me. I continued to follow it for 3 minutes until my sight of it was blocked by trees and then the object completely disappeared (possibly landing). I followed and saw the object starting from the intersection of Stony Point Road and Todd Road until the intersection of Stony Point Road and Dutton Ave. It was after that that I lost sight of the object.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Unusual Red/Orange Spheres Arrive and form a triangle over Santa Rosa, Sonoma County USA;2009-08-23 21:00:00;15 minutes;Unusual Red/Orange Spheres Arrive and form a triangle over Santa Rosa, Sonoma County USA At 8:45PM On August 23rd 2009 It was calm and quiet night and the sun had been down for about an hour when I stepped outside my front door at noticed what at first appeared to me to be 4 airplanes landing in a in-coming flight path.  I quickly realized that these in coming objects were bright red/orange and followed the same flight path...  I called for my wife and a few neighbors to witness this sighting.  WE all gathered and watched the orange/red spheres move across the sky almost like they were moving in our direction.  If they had continued across the sky I could of thought of a few possible explainations for the occurence but they didnt... they stopped.  One by one, 4 of them arriving at first.  One stopped sharply and held its position while another went up and stopped and another dropped lower to its position.  The last of the 4 went straight up and stopped.  It was still really calm out and there wasnt a sound to be heard and were all used to airplanes & h! elicopters flying over us, this wasnt the case this time.  All 4 UFO's held that position for at least 5 mins until 2 more red/orange spheres appeared from the same North Eastern direction as the other 4... and joined them by finding there position in what seemed to me to be a flight formation.   All 6 spheres held that position for at least 10 mins as we watched them all slow pull away out of the atmosphere until them looked just like stars... then disappeared. During part of the sighting I ran and got my camera and took the pictures that I will include, I've also made a short youtube video of the original photos and some blow-ups of the objects... simply amazing!;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
large groups of lights flying in the same direction silently;2011-02-27 23:00:00;30 minutes;large groups of lights flying in the same direction silently yesterday night around 11:00pm...i went outside to look at the stars and i saw a group of lights that were flying in the sky headed in the same direction,there were to many to count..i went back inside to get my sister in law and her sister to come outside to see those lights that were flying slowly on the sky..we saw some bright lights and some that were'nt bright..it was a trip because their were flying the same direction and really slow..they were in a big flying formation and i noticed that some were bright but i could  see other crafts flying next to them but with no lights on but you could still see them in the shadows following the bright ones,i watch them for about 10 minutes until the clouds blocked my view;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

Low flying orange ball of light moves across northern California.;2013-11-16 19:30:00;2 minutes;Low flying orange ball of light moves across northern California. Was driving down a residential street and saw a orange ball of light in the sky.  Thought it was a plane because we have an airport nearby and planes travel that same flight path to get to the airport and it appeared to be low enough as the planes that come in to land but as it slowly moved northbound I saw it drop three smaller orange balls of light from the orange orb which stayed lit all the way to the ground.  Then the main orange ball flickered away and disappeared for a moment then reappeared and dropped two more orange balls of light and I lost sight of it as it continued to move away.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Orange sphere that suddenly disappears.;2014-04-10 10:40:00;1 minute;Orange sphere that suddenly disappears. I am filing this report for my son, daughter and her boyfriend.  They are reluctant to report the incident because they are shy.  I was inside the house and they came bursting in through the front door.  My daughter was particularly excited and very animated about the incident.  It is interesting because a husband and wife reported seeing the exact same thing my children reported on the same 4/10/14 date and time.  We do not know the couple at all. My children saw the object from Baker Avenue in front of our house.  This is across town my many miles from the other report.  They reported that the sphere was orange in color.  It traveled at the speed of an airplane and it looked to be the same size as a full moon.  There was no sound.  They did know how high or far away it was.  They also said the sphere suddenly vanished.  I am making this report so that others that saw the same thing have the courage to come forward too.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Orange pulsating sphere.;2014-04-10 20:38:00;1 minutes;Orange pulsating sphere At 8:38 pm tonight my wife and I were driving eastbound on Montgomery Dr. in Santa Rosa Ca. heading home to Sonoma.  I Saw Directly in front of us an orange light that I first thought was an airplane.   I asked my wife if she could see navigational lights on it she said no it was slowly pulsing.   I was approaching the intersection of Los Alamos Rd I stopped looked out my open window and it stopped.   It was approximately 2500 feet up I heard no sound and then it  reversed direction stopped again hovered still pulsating, dimmed and then went completely out. I had the feeling it knew I was watching it.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Three white, multi-faceted, pulsing orbs form a triangle.;2014-12-07 00:00:00;45 minutes;Three white, multi-faceted, pulsing orbs form a triangle. Three white pulsing orbs were seen.  They appeared faceted (like a round faceted crystal). At 12 am I saw one large orb.  It appeared to be coming closer, directly towards me and extremely slowly appearing to become slightly larger in size. By 12:10 there were two, one small one now closely above and to the right. Then later a third small orb of equal size appeared a good distance to the right  The small orbs appeared also to be farther away. The pulsing was beautiful and hypnotic.  I found it difficult to break away. I experienced a sense of timelessness and weightlessness while watching the large orb. I finally stopped watching and then looked again at 12:30 to find the positions had changed. A large triangle was formed by the three orb points. The large orb was above while the two equally sized smaller orbs were positioned below and respectively to the left and right of the larger orb, forming an obtuse isosceles triangle. They remained this way until at least 12:45, at which time a marine layer came in and began obscuring the view.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Bright orange planet-like object sighted near Cassiopia;2016-12-20 22:30:00;2 minutes;Bright orange planet-like object sighted near Cassiopia. Right around 10:30pm the evening of December 20, 2016, I saw what looked like a bright, orange planet the size of Venus, just Northeast of Caph in Cassiopeia.  I stared at it for about 30 seconds and I thought I perceived it to be moving--very slowly so I assumed it was an aircraft.   I went inside to get my binoculars in the 45 seconds it took me to come back outside, the object had vanished.  I stared at the spot where I had seen it and I noticed another object nearby, about the same size, only dim and fuzzy grey in color.   It was moving quickly, roughly North to South trajectory, and disappeared from view within 30 seconds.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
