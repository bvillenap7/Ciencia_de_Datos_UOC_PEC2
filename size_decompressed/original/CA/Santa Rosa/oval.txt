The object was moving slowly across the sky going east to west. After about 15-20 sec. object suddenly speed up to super sonic speed ( 20,000 mph ). At the time I thought it was heading down toward the Santa Rosa airport and attempted to track it. At the time I was 18 years old and lived and worked at a sawmill in Windsor. For some unknown reason I never mentioned it to anyone until a year after the incident. When I was alone with my thoughts the vivid memory would re- surface and I would wonder why I was unable to discuss the matter openly. I lived alone as the night watchman at the sawmill and had just finished dining alone at a German themed restuarant. It was dusk and no alchohol or drugs were involved.  I always wondered if other people saw the same thing that evening.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
Luminescent blue lozenge flew across nose of airplane at night.  6-8 feet long.  Santa Rosa / Novato, CA;2004-09-29 22:00:00;2-3 seconds;Luminescent blue lozenge flew across nose of airplane at night.  6-8 feet long.  Santa Rosa / Novato, CA September 29, 2004 (from FAA logbook entry)  Occurred during a night flight, as pilot, aircraft: PA-28  Approximately 10pm, 6500ft, west of Santa Rosa (KSTS), over the coast - unlimited visibility, had just looked west for jets, east for jets, south for jets, listening to Oakland Center. All quiet. Suddenly, BIG BLUE LIGHT at my 10 o'clock, flashing past the nose and off out over the ocean to my 2 o'clock. 2-3 seconds total. Instinctually, I slammed the yoke forward and turned hard right. At the same time I thought... I JUST LOOKED and there was nothing? HOW could I could have missed a jet's landing light? WHY is there a jet at 6500 feet traveling west here? (it's not on any flight path that I know of) It's too late to dive out of the way, I'm going to get hit by turbulence no matter what..... then, I didn't get physically hit? Hey, if it's a landing light, how can I could still see it as it winked out over the ocean?  This made no sense. On first impression, a jet and the bright light I saw was the landing light - then thinking about it, No - it couldn't be a landing light - I could see it as it went away from me. a meteor, A luminescent blue meteor? But, it didn't get dim over the ocean, it just winked out. making me think: no smoke trail. How could it be a meteor?  I couldn't figure out exactly how close it was - but, it appeared at my 10 o'clock and went over the ocean at about my 2 o'clock - and it was only visible for 2-3 seconds. So - it had to be darned close. If I had to guess, less than 200 feet. Maybe 6 to 10 feet long, 4-5 feet wide and 1-2 feet thick. Or maybe 100 feet and it would be a bit smaller. No wind turbulence, no sound. Weirdest thing I've seen. I can't help thinking that some ET teenager swiped the keys to the saucer when the parents were out and went out with his buddy's for a night of ET style cow tipping...... btw: I was so shocked that I couldn't talk enough to call Oakland Center (ZOA).......;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

Another object after viewing through binoculars, dark red in color, moved in and close - with no other objects in the sky.  We deployed our telescope, not capturing the red entity as it moved close and disappeared from the football - as we deployed our highest resolution telescope - we observed one object of pulsating and flashing lights, stagnant in the sky - but then moving extremely down range with dark red orange.red.  With our high powered telescope we kept it in range for an hour or more.  A plane passed, with thin wings across my line of site with the object, not a commercial vehicle.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
White 'Orb' seen hovering in Eastern Day-time Sky;2021-06-11 16:33:00;25min;White 'Orb' seen hovering in Eastern Day-time Sky Sighting occurred in the direction of ESE and at an altitude of appx 55 to 65 above the horizon.  Shape and color of the object appeared to be 'white' and 'oval' or 'orb-shaped' against the blue daytime (cloudless) sky. Initially appeared as a single object, and then eventually divided into two (or another simply 'appeared' alongside it, ..not known) Immediately went to a neighbor's shop for secondary witnesses to the event. All three of us saw the occurrence.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
