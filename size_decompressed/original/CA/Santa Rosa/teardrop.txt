Black in color flying south west across my large field of view. About a mile away maybe closer at about 800-1000 feet. traveling at a higer speed than normal craftbased on the distance from me. did not appear to have a fuselage or central cabin. Th  width or wingspan  was possibly 60 or so feet.the drooped wing tips were snarply curved at the tips. I see a lot of different typed of aircraft from my vantage point. all the aircraft I see are easily recoginized by anyone. These two craft are nothing I have ever seen in the sky. I was a military policeman in the Army and am quite clear on the shape of these two. The speed wasconsiderably faster than anything short of a military jet. The crafts made no sound at all they were definatly in formation flying parallel to each other,at about more than their wingspan apart. They traveled south to north/ westerly. I contacted the local newspaper with this info. They called back at my requestand said that there were no other reports of this.I do not firmly beleive in UFO's or disbeleive. My speaking with the newspaper was to see if anyone else had seen them. Rhe shape to clarify was a arcwing thickess could have bee as much as several feet tapering to a thick tip.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
