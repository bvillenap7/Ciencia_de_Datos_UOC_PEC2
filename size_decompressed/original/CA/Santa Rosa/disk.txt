Sorry about informing you about this 19 years after the fact.  Anyway, I thought you might want to hear about what my brother and I witnessed. From our vantage point from a mountain northeast of Santa Rosa we spied the object perfectly sillouetted against a river of fog luminated by a full moon that was flowing across the entire valley below.I would quess that we were about seven miles away as the crow flies. I make that assumption based upon my knowledge of how far the city of Sabastopol is from Santa Rosa. Using the lights of Sabastopol peaking through the fog as a measuring stick I would have to say the object was close to being at least a mile across.Now unlike other alledged sightings this object did not have any flashing lights.I thought it strange that it wasn't illuminated like the fog or lit up at all.It was like light had no affect upon it. It was  flat dark grey in color.It had a dome on top and bottom. Hollywood movie makers could not have created a more perfect saucer,only this one was real. We looked at it for about two hours before getting bored and to cold to look at it anymore, then went home. All the time we were watching it, it didn't do anything.  It just sat motionless above the fog as the fog flowed beneath it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is public employee.  Date in 1974 is approximate.  PD));38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

Pitch black disk shaped object in broad daylight. 4 witnesses;1998-08-23 11:45:00;2 minutes;Pitch black disk shaped object in broad daylight. 4 witnesses Myself and three other cast members of a local play were warming our vocals prior to a Sunday matinee performance of Peter Pan (Musical). I noticed a black object in the sky.  It was a clear, cloudless daytime sky. The black object was like a coin flipping but it was also moving up and down similar to how a beach ball with only a little bit of water inside of it and the rest of it air will wobble when you throw it. At first I thought it might be a trash can lid stuck in a strange wind.  I brought it to the attention of the others and we were all deliberating as to what the object could be.  We could not tell if it was a large object and far away or if it was small and closer to us.  The movement of the object seemed to be random enough that we thought it was not a craft. Then it stopped spinning and wobbling and moved at an upward angle in one direction getting further away and seemingly smaller and smaller as it did so.  It was much higher in the air as it disappeared entirely from sight.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
