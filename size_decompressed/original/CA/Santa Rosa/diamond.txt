small shiny diamond hovers;2010-02-24 15:30:00;2 minutes;small shiny diamond hovers we were just leaving Spring Lake Park and looking north east towards the mountains over Rincon Valley when we saw a dark small shiny object reflecting the sun in a backdrop of shifting clouds.   I mentioned it to my hiking partner ans she saw it as well.  It hovered in the same spot around 2500 feet off the ground as the clouds moved behind it.  We hiked down the trail to another vantage point and it was still there.  It was way too high to be a kite, and didn't move with the wind.  We moved on, but now, tonight we still don't know what that was....? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
