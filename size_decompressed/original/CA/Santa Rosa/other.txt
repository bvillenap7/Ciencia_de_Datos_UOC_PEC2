It looked Like a satellite 1230AM outside in my backyard at XXXXX Belmont California 94402.  When all of a sudden I heard the sound of high voltage being turned on the floating object resembled the floating craft heading toward Ceres.  The Dawn.  However, it looked like a floating satellite.  And of course it is physically impossible to float a satellite.  Given the major fact it would have to over come an environment with no gravity.   The most astonishing part of the whole 3 minutes was there was no noise except for the lights turning on and a part on it was rotating those were the only noises I heard.  It was. I believe, illuminated on right side only.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
3 bright white flashes high up in night sky and V shaped craft faint white w/round white lights silently going overhead so. to north;2001-08-19 20:00:00;15 minutes;3 bright white flashes high up in night sky and V shaped craft faint white w/round white lights silently going overhead so. to north I was out on my backyard deck watching the stars by myself, hoping to see a shooting star. My family was inside watching TV. As I sat and faced south, I noticed a sudden flash in the upper sky, way high up near the stars. It flashed a bright white that crossed the sky then was gone as suddenly as it came, like a camera flash in intensity and suddenness. I thought that was strange and kept looking to see where it had come from. It was straight ahead in the south, up at the top of the sky where I was looking. It happened again a couple of minutes later. I thought that was even stranger and called to my kids to come out and see this, but they declined.  I waited, looking for something else that might happen and it happened again and this time I saw a very bright yellow/white light moving very fast from north to south way up where the light had come from. Way high up. I watched it and had a hard time keeping track of it as it moved very fast and winked out and in, gone and then showing up a few seconds later way far ahead of where it had been going. Then, as I tried to track it,I noticed that I was seeing something with the corner of my eye, the peripheal vision. It was very faint white, like the moon in the daytime sky and I could only see it out of the corner of my eye. Every time I turned to view it with my full frontal vision, it disappeared.  I kept track of it's movement by looking out the corner of my eye and trying to catch it with my full vision as it moved south to north coming towards my house, altho it was very high up. I forgot about the other light as this one intrigued me. As it moved closer, it was still only visible thru periphial vision until it got right over my backyard and then my house and then I could see it was in the shape of a boomerang, longer on one end than the other of the V shape, and faint, faint white like whispy clouds look in the day sky but in a row along the V shape were round white lights. It moved very slowly and silently over my yard and house, but also very high up. I saw a jet moving across the sky with blinking lights and it was very tiny compared to the size of this thing that was moving so slowly and so high up. The jet was down much closer to earth and to me and was just a speck compared to this craft looming silently so high above us. I held up my hand to it to measure, and the faint white craft was the distance across of my thumb outstretched to my little finger if my hand was spread open. Maybe 8 inches in length. The jet that crossed way beneath it, so much closer to the earth and to me was the size of a beebee. I called for the kids to come out and see it, but they were too afraid to come see it go flying past our house and keep heading north until it was too faint to see anymore. It seemed that I should hear some sound, but there was no sound at all.  I don't know what the connection of the flashes of light were to this, but to me they seemed somehow connected. If it was that big and so far away, so high up in the heavens, how big was it?  It's funny about the flashes, too, because I saw flashes several years ago too, in a different part of Calif. I was driving home on hwy 101 and coming from Marin County to Sonoma County and I was surprised to see a bright flash of white light in the dark night coming from my right where there is no housing for miles. I remember thinking to myself, Huh. That was strange. and driving on into the night. A few minutes later, it happened again, and the weird part was, again, I thought to myself, Huh. That was strange. It happened 3 times in a row and every time, I had the same reaction as if it was the first time. Then, I thought that THAT was strange. The strangest part of all was that it seemed beyond my control to think that and keep on driving and not really turning to look at where the light flash came from. Just keep on driving. Don't look. And I did it like it was mind control. It wasn't until I got home that it all hit me as being really strange and wonder why I didn't stop to look and see where the light was coming from. It was also high up in the sky, I thought, but lower than what I saw in my back yard this time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Fast moving object , possible cigar shape;2002-09-25 05:50:00;3-4 seconds;Fast moving object , possible cigar shape Early in the morning while walking into work I was looking up at the sky since it was clear with many stars out and noticed a small, fast moving light in the North-East portion of the sky.It was bluish-white and at first I only thought it was a satellite when all of a sudden it made a dive towards the ground while at the same time making a sharp arc down and to the left, nearly reversing it's direction of travel. I would compare it to watching a kite dive at the ground, this moved extremely fast. I had the impression it was large and had a blue-white light in the center with two elipses illuminated at either end, it seemed to have a possible cigar shape to it. While making it's dive and turn it just faded quickly. The whole event lasted between 3-4 seconds, I was stunned at the speed this object moved at. I am not positive on this time frame because I hesitated to report this but I am quite certain that what I saw was out of the ordinary and also similar to another California report for September.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353

B2 shaped UFO observed in the sky;2007-12-30 20:15:00;3-4 SECONDS;B2 shaped UFO observed in the sky This object appeared within several hundred yards from where I was walking my dog that evening. I happened to catch it in the corner of my eye, atfirst thinking it was a bird (we have geese and a large white owl in this park). Unfortunately, I had on earphones listening to my mp3 player so I did not hear any sound coming from the object, however, even at my usual volume I can hear autos and small planes. I heard nothing during my viewing. The object was heading due East (flying west to east). What immediately caught my eye was that it appeared transparent, it was a starry evening, relatively clear, and it looked like the stars were reflecting from the bottom of the object. I saw no lights whatsoever so I knew this was no a civilian or possibly even military aircraft. Size wise, I would say it was about as big as a small private plane. Oddly, the most striking resemblance I can compare it to is the wingshaped B2 bomber. It had a dome cockpit type area and wings that had cut outs similiar to the B2. This object was much smaller. I did not see any lights until it was almost out of sight and it appeared that above the edges of the wing tips there were circular housing that emitted a bright, glowing red light. Again, above, not below like a normal aircraft. I would estimate it's speed at approx. 150-200mph.(I do that having been to many air shows and observing other aricraft over the years. I was approx. 200-500 feet high, which I also found odd seeing that it was heading directly over the center of town. I go to the same area many nights during the week. I have yet to see it again.

Unkown obj. with beam of white light moved horizontally, before taking off into sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;1 minute;Unkown object with beam of white light moved horizontally before taking off into sky.  A vapor like substance  left a 'stain' in the sky Started out as a still (white) light.  Then it projected a stream or beam of light (same color).  During this time, the object was not moving.  Then it started moving with the beam of light going with it. It was also almost as if the light was giving off steam or there was vapor coming it.  The object continued to move horizontally for about 15 seconds.  The beam of light stop and then the object was slowly taking off Vertically into the sky.  The beam literally left a bright 'stain' in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time and date.  Suspected sighting of the U. S. Navy missile launch.

On our way to the lake, it caught the corner of my eye.  The only way I can describe it is...  Looked like a flying dune buggy with 2 bars above (on either side of it).  It didn't look like it had any wings or propellers.   It is hard to say how big or far away it was, since I had no point of reference.  But from my perspective, it looked rather high (1-2 miles high).  It seemed too big to be a drone.  But again, it's hard to say against nothing but clouds.  It had no lights (that I could see) & didn't seem to make any noise. It was heading in the direction of my house so I called my daughter to keep an eye out for it. I tried to take a picture but it was out of my sight by the time I grabbed my phone.;38.4474667647059;-122.722105882353
