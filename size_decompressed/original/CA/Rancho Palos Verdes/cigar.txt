Bright, fast bar of light in the sky in Southern CA on 2/28/21 at 9:15PM;2021-02-28 21:15:00;30 seconds;Bright, fast bar of light in the sky in Southern CA on 2/28/21 at 9:15PM Rancho Palos Verdes, CA/February 28 @ 9:15PM:  Unidentified Sighting  My husband and my 10-year-old daughter saw a strange bar of extremely bright light in the air. They went outside as it circled in the sky for about 30 seconds. It was soundless and unnaturally smooth. Then, the object glided out of sight, heading north at a tremendous speed. It appeared to be about 500 feet in the sky and seemed too large to be a drone. We were not able to capture a picture of it ourselves, but after looking online we found picture almost identical to what we saw.;33.7515;-118.367
