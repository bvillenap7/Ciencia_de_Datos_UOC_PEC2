Now I know I have never before seen something like this. While driving, I looked up and a bright light was in the sky. The sky was perfectly clear. The light was very bright and appeared to be stationary. It was about the apparent size of Venus, which I thought odd since it was 8:30 in the morning and definitely not a star or planet.  When the light faded I observed a shape that looked like a pill capsule and silver-grey in color with no lights that I could detect on the object. It started moving to the South East. It moved in spurts moving a bit and then not moving, and then moving and then not moving, etc. in a straight line. There seemed to be a very light trail, like an exhaust, left behind it when it moved, but this did not linger. It was moving towards the east-south east and disapeared fading out of view. I was driving when I saw this and knew that it was in vain to try and catch up to it, but I didn't think to pull over and watch it.;38.9377;-123.0685
