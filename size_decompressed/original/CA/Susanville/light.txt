North Eastern Calif.  Fiery object emits fire like objects that float down to ground.;2002-12-24 21:00:00;3 minutes;North Eastern Calif.  Fiery object emits fire like objects that float down to ground. On December 24, 2002 I pulled up to one of my friends house, him and another friend said they were going up to the construction site of a new hospital where my friend worked as the night secuirty guard. (Only person at the site at night) The security guard had called terrified, babbling, and literally crying that a UFO was hovering over his office(the guard is 6'2 and weighes around 200 lbs.)  I immideately drove to his work located about a mile and a half from where I was at.  On the way up I saw an orange light in the sky but thought that it probably was just a airplane and didn't notice when it must have disappeared. When we got up to the hospital the security guard was still hysterical and was trying to tell us what it looked like and what it was doing.  We kind of joked with him for about ten minutes when we all went into his office that was located in a modular next to the hospital.  I called my father who is the chief of one of the fire departments in town and asked him if he would call dispatch and see if anyone had reported anything.  One of my other friends called his girlfriend on the office phone.  The guard sat down in his chair and said to me I was looking out this window when I first saw it, as the security guard pointed out the window to show me where, he said, Oh my god there it is again. When I looked out the window I saw an orange light that was bright orange.  It was somewhere around six hundred feet off the ground and about a mile away.  I could not pick out a shape of the object only that it was emmiting a light that looked like fire and that it was coming closer.  I immediately called my dad who lives up on a hill about the same distance away and told him that I didn't know what this thing was and for him to try to see it from his advantage.  Then the UFO started emitting little tracer fire balls that looked like they were floating down (swaying back and forth).  It must have dropped around 8 of these.  I then became frantic when my friends started screaming in terror as this object is slowly coming towards us.  My parents immediately hung up on me when they heard my friends screaming to come to where we were at.  At this time I felt that it was time to leave so we ran to the cars.  As we were running a car came over the horizon and the UFO dissappeared like turning off a light bulb in a dark room. Friends of ours and my parents and grandfather arrived shortly and we stayed there for a while but it never came back.  The security guard said that when saw the UFO the first time a car stopped alongside the highway to watch.  But never heard any other reports.  Would love to know if anyone has seen anything similar in the North eastern California, South eastern Oregon, or North west Nevada area.  swanpig_33@hotmail.com;40.4028428571428;-120.646957142857
I was on a boat in Eagle lake, I looked up and seen a light streak across the sky from NE to SW at dawn. It was moving faster than any;2003-10-05 06:15:00;2 seconds;I was on a boat in Eagle lake, I looked up and seen a light streak across the sky from NE to SW at dawn. It was moving faster than any plane I've ever seen... moved in a semi circle path across the sky in about two seconds. At first I thought it was a metorite, but when I saw the second light appear and that it followed an arc I realized it wasn't.;40.4028428571428;-120.646957142857
Now I believe;2006-12-22 22:30:00;Approx. 2 Hours;Now I believe On December 22nd, 2006 at Approximately 10:30 Pm while working as a Tower Officer at a Prison, a call came to me from another tower. The Officer asked if I was watching or noticed the lights beyond the Prison water towers facing North.  At first glimpse I noticed two flourescent orange orbs of light equally distanced from each other which appeared to be hovering.  I grabbed a pair of Binoculars and hoisted my hands on window bars to steady the shaking of my hands.   Now a clear shot I watched as both orbs seemed to be in conjunction with the other, perfect match of each others size... As one orb would appear to get brighter the other would dim then two smaller lights shot from the left orb.  After about ten minutes or so watching these objects I witnessed a smaller row of orange orb-like lights seem to have turned on, above the two bigger orbs, this was all one object I'm sure. These smaller lights seemed to twinkle as they spun in a sort of carousel motion. The closest thing to the looks of the object is a gigantic freight-liner with running lights coming at you head-on.  This lasted for an approximate 2 hours. There is nothing but BLM land and forest there.  Later that morning at 0600 Hours I was relieved of shift and drove up a single dirt road to where I thought this object was, my car lights began to putter dim and I turned around and took off!  I am in the Air Force and have seen many strange lights but this is the closest thing I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Bright planet like light hovers then takes off.;2014-10-08 20:15:00;5 minutes;Bright planet like light hovers then takes off. In back yard. Looked up saw pretty blue-white light, planet like object. Was about to tell husband to come and look at the super bright planet, when it took off.   Hollered at husband look, look he saw it also.  It flew off and disappeared into the tree tops. Looked around for it and didn't see it.  Went into the house to get binoculars. Went into front yard.  Saw a distant object flashing red and blue.   Checked it with binoculars, circular object flashing red and blue but not solid colors more like flashes coming out the sides or maybe object spinning.   Went back inside finally found camera, looked for it again and saw nothing.;40.4028428571428;-120.646957142857
More Russian space-junk?;2016-01-08 19:20:00;1-2 minutes;More Russian space-junk? I observed three amber/reddish color lights, no visible running-lights, traveling in a southeasterly direction, at roughly equal distances apart, until they disappeared behind a cloud-bank, one-by-one.   They appeared to be travelling at roughly the altitude and speed, of a small civilian aircraft.  They made no discernible noise.
