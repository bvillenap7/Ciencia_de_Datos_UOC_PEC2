Minister and police spot ufos in Susanville,CA  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect twinkling stars.  PD));2004-08-24 23:00:00;All night;Minister and police spot ufos in Susanville,CA For the past seven days, my wife and I have been observing every night 3 to 6 craft in the sky. They change colors (red, green, blue,)and when we observe them through the binoculars we notice they change from saucer to oval shaped. We can see like portals on the top outside of the craft through the binoculars. With the naked eye they sway from side to side. A green light or red light blinking it changes. Just a few nights ago my wife and I were in Skyline park in the desert in Susanville and we were observing them. A police car pulled up and the officer walked up to us. She asked us what we were doing and we told her and pointed out a ufo. We handed her the binoculars and she looked at it. She looks back at us with a stunned look on her face and then pulled her maglite and flashed the craft. The craft flashed back at us and it moved, the officer then looked at us and said: Did you guys see that it moved! and then said again to us: You guys are freaking me out! and she took off! We noticed that there will be two of these objects by the moon and the rest in a circular position in the night sky around the Susanville area. Another thing I would like to add is that the objects will black out when we try to see them in our telescope, when we look away they turn their lights back on. They dont seem to mind us looking at them through the binoculars. Yesterday my wife and I flashed one of the closest ones with a spotlight and it moved its way toward us, so my wife runs in the house to avoid it.We have currently had a small storm and that night with the police officer there was a storm in the distance about a mile , it seemed like they were observing the storm.These ufos are still out here right now.
