It was roughly due-east of Susanville, CA appearing to be approx. in the area of the CA/NV, state-line, at an approx. altitude, of 10K-20K ft.  I initially thought that it could have been an aircraft, which suddenly burst into flames- but so far, I have heard no such reports.;40.4028428571428;-120.646957142857
