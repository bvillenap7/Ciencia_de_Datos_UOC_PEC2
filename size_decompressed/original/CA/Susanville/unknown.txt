It dissappeared and reappeared.;2005-08-07 18:55:00;1 1/2 hours;It dissappeared and reappeared. I was on my way home from Reno, NV to Susanville, CA on highway 395. Up above the sun every so often I would see the sun shine on something that looked metallic for 30-40 seconds then the object would dissapear. I first noticed the objects a few miles before Herlong and all the into Susanville I saw it. So I stopped at my moms shop on main street to see if my driving was causing it to go in and out of focus. As I was standing out on the side walk I saw it again and yelled for my mom to look but by the time she came out it was not visible. So I am wondering if it was a satellite, planet, star, or whatever. I have seen something similar a few weeks ago but it was about 2:30 in the afternoon and off to the east.;40.4028428571428;-120.646957142857
