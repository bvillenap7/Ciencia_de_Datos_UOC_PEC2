slowmoveing  fire ball in sky;2010-10-11 12:30:00;about 45 min;slowmoveing  fire ball in sky On Monday, October 11, 2010, my mom and i saw a fire ball looking craft in the sky.  It was dropping fire balls and it was moveing slowly to it was not a meteor.  It could have been a falling satalite or something but it was moving slowly and would get bigger once it looked like it burned away.  The first one i saw which was also the closest looked like it had wings on it.  Once my mom went to bed me and my friend saw both more but they were further away.  We could see all of them until they went befind the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.6889;-121.2263
