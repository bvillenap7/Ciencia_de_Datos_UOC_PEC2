Ive probably seen over thirty diffren paranormal sightings maybe more.This one was one of the most amazing things I have seen so far. It was a round ball of whitish blue eluminating like it was on fire,just white and blue insted of a fire ball which is orangeish red. Anyway,the object whitch was round was falling from the sky and exploded before it hit the ground.The weird part of the explosion was when it exploded pieces of the object stayed the elumanating colors. It was amazing,the thing poped apart,it did this before it hit the groundweired. My wife and I have also seen orange globe shaped lights in the tree line approx.4-5 times.We have witnessed about six diffrent out of this world objects,lights about 30 diffrent times. Something is deffinitly going on!Bizzar to say the least.;38.6889;-121.2263
