Vee shaped red/orange lights moving east to west over Sacramento.;2005-01-29 19:05:00;3-5 seconds;Vee shaped red/orange lights moving east to west over Sacramento. Approx 6 very faded red/orange rectangular lights in a vee formation.  Based on the disappearing background of stars, the object gave the appearance of a vee.  Based on my point of view, the object was very large.  I could not judge the altitude but had the impression it was not as high as a jet in the normal departure altitude (from Sac Intl. The lights were solid but very dim.  There was no sound.  I waited 30 seconds for a jet sound.  I just finished viewing the comet and turned to the south and caught a fast movement of an object moving from west to east.  As I looked in a direction of approx SE the object was visible for approx 3 seconds before it vanished in the east.  I am use to seeing jets and hearing them a few seconds later.  To the north, approx 40 degrees was an airplane displaying appropriate lights traveleing to the north.    Earlier I saw a satelite moveing north to south.  This definitely was not a satelite and did not match any sound, sight or behavior of an any aircraft I've ever seen.;38.6889;-121.2263
