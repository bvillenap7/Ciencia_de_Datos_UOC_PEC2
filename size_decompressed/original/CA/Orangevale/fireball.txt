3 Objects traversing the sky, burning out eventually;2000-03-11 19:45:00;5 min;3 Objects traversing the sky, burning out eventually I was looking roughly to north and noticed 3 bright yellow lights in the sky about 35 degrees above the horizon altitude unknown.  They moving one behind the other approximately from the north to the south at about the same speed as a high altitude jet liner would be moving.  With my arm extended straight out, each object was two hand widths from the next in a single file.  When they reached the highest point above the horizon, about 75 degrees, the middle light went out.  As it went out, smaller bright yellow pieces fell off.  They looked to be burning.  These pieces went out after a few seconds.  As the remaining two objects approached about 45 degree off the southern horizon, each burned out within about 10 seconds of each other.  They also dropped pieces that were lit for about 2-3 seconds.  This is all I saw. My first guess was some kind of missle.  What is strange is that they were moving north to south.  I am not aware of any missle ranges north of Sacramento.  Also, if they were dropping debris, it is likely that some might fall onto a city.  Beale AFB is close by.  Perhaps they were testing something.  About 2 years ago, I saw something similar occur over my house, but the direction was south to north.  I did not file a report on this object, but could if you want.  There were some unique features of this other account that may interest you.  I left my phone number off below.

8 Orange Fireballs In sky;2013-10-12 23:28:00;10 minutes;8 Orange Fireballs In sky. On October 12, 2013, about 11:30 at night my boyfriend screamed for me to come outside to look at the sky.  There was 8 orange ball shaped lights in the sky about 1200ft in the air hovering over us.  When one would move they all followed pursuit four on top and four on the bottom.  It was something we had never seen before.   It scared us and we ran back in the house and shut the door. I then called my friends that live a 1/2 mile away and I told them to go outside to look.  They called back saying they seen nothing.  I then called my mother got her answering machine and left her a message about this.  The time was about 11:40 pm.  After that I went outside to look and they were gone. The next morning I woke up and called my mom. She then told me that it was 9:00 pm when I called according to her answering machine.  About 2 weeks has gone by and I went to visit some friends that live about 40 minutes away.  I didn’t mention anything about these lights to them.  My friend then asked me if her boyfriend told me about the lights they had seen in my neighborhood and that they had used there cell phone to video them. What was weird is they say they had just left our house from visiting with us but we had just got home and had been gone for hours.  But they couldn’t have visited us because we didn’t get home until 11:30pm.  We both had seen the same lights and they said that 3 other cars had pulled over to look, their video is timed at 11:28 pm.  Weird.  They said they they looked like they were coming toward them one by one then each one disappeared one by one.;38.6889;-121.2263
