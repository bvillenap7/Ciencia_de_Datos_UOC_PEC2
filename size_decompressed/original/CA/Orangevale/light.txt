40 independent orange lights seen traveling over Orangevale  CA;2014-03-15 21:30:00;30 minutes;40 independent orange lights seen traveling over Orangevale  CA On 3/15/14 from, 9:30 pm - 10:00 pm, I saw a total of 40 orange lights fly one by one, in a conventional manner towards our home in Orangevale, Ca.   They were flying one by one from the area of Folsom, Ca.  They did not appear to be part of a solid object.  Most were independent flying.  A couple were in tandem.   They would head towards Orangevale, then once they got to a certain point they would gradually blink out of sight.  A few flew off towards the east.   There was no sound.  They were not helicopters either.   All were the same size and color of orange.;38.6889;-121.2263
Bright Amber Intelligently controlled Aircraft rising like bees from a hive in Orangevale, CA.;2014-03-15 21:50:00;10 minutes;Bright Amber Intelligently controlled Aircraft rising like bees from a hive in Orangevale, CA. My son and I were going for a late night Taco Bell run on the evening of Saturday the 15th at 9:50 pm.Â  As we drove East on Central Ave. Approaching Beach Ave. I saw strange hovering and moving amber color flying objects in the eastern sky a bit north of Folsom lake.  We pulled into the parking lot at the elementary school on the mentioned corner.  My son saw them also and we both agreed that they weren't airplanes or helicopters and that there were about 12 that we saw.  We pulled out our cell phones and took video of the sighting for about 3 minutes. The objects seemed to be coming up on a steep ascension from near Folsom Lake and Eldorado Hills.  One would go up and hover high north of Folsom Lake and seemed to wait and overlook the next two objects and then the following ones would disappear quickly in a ENE direction with the waiting object quickly following.  This scenario happened three times that we saw. Who knows if it was going on prior to what we saw. Unfortunately the objects were too far away to see a definitive shape of the aircraft.  All I know is that they were very bright amber and acted almost like when you see bees coming out of a hive with a steep climb then one hovers to wait for another couple then the waiting one takes off afterwards.;38.6889;-121.2263
