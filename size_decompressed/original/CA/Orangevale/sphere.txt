I live in Orangevale Ca,and in nights previous to this night I have noticed helicopters and plains flying in a rectangular form  always being  three at a time. My wife and I also noticed  objects that appear to be stars but move about the sky to fast and take angles that no conventional or military aircraft could. Most of the time they vanish. Think that’s odd? It pales in comparison to what we seen the other night.  Naturally I was looking in the night sky on 6-5-08 enjoying a smoke when I noticed a plain in the sky right over head.I gazed amongst it and thought it was odd when all the animals started going crazy,I could not here the plain which I thought was odd being how close it was approx.200 yds away.Out from the top side off the tree shot out a white spherical shaped object really white but didn’t light up the area ,it was strange.It was only about 50 yds  in the air and about 50 -80 yds away. It traveld north to south vertically across the sky and it was huge. The size could be compares to a marker from where I was and it also left a sort off streek behind it.Whoever was in this plain had to off seen this  also.The light or object seemed to disapear when it started traveling under the area of the plain.I would love to know if anyone else seen this in or near Orangevale Ca,.If I see anything else odd I will post it on this site.;38.6889;-121.2263
