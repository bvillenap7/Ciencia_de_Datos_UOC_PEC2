Color changing craft seen above Los Angeles suburbs;2003-07-11 01:30:00;2 + hrs;Color changing craft seen above Los Angeles suburbs This morning I went to bed & my head was faceing by window (that has sheer) curtains & I noticed a light & thought is was a plane. I closed my eyes & opened them again & saw the light again & said humm it must be a start. Then I said that is to low to be a start I then got out pulled back my curtain & looked at it. I saw that there was not flashing lights like a plane & that it looked like it was trying to keep it's balance. It was in the same basic spot moving side to side just a bit like I said maybe to keep it's balance is the only way to put it. I then called my son in the room to come & look at it we watched it for a couple of hours. At one point the light fadded out to a pin point & then became bright again. We watched it move around & it looked like a red color would appear on the UFO like in the middle of it not a dot of red like it was a red smear forming in front of our eyes. This was not a plane this was a UFO.;34.0031999999999;-117.9617
UFO red light follows plane LAX path over Hacienda Heights.;2013-06-30 20:30:00;2+ minutes;UFO red light follows plane LAX path over Hacienda Hights Approximately around 8:30 pm we were walking around our enclosed community up in the hills of Hacienda Heights near Colima Rd and Stimpson Ave. The flight path to LAX is overhead, direction from East to West. During our walk (walking from west to east) we noticed a Glowing Red Orb (light) that seemed to be following one of the jets (distance unknown).  The red glowing orb seemed  to slow down giving itself some distance and then seemed to stop or moving extremely slow.  The orb then shifted its path southward and then started a moving up and the light started to fade.  As the light ascended, it grew dimmer until it faded out of sight. Flight path of object was same as Jets flying overhead and same height, helicopters do not follow the same path, height or speed, light was a strong and steady red, brighter than the headlights of a jetliner. It was a clear night, no clouds, visibility of flights were clear and easily visible and identifiable.;34.0031999999999;-117.9617
Blue/white star like lights shoot fast across sky almost blurred.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-08 21:00:00;3 seconds;Blue/white star like lights shoot fast across sky almost blurred At night, parked at a target while in my car about a week ago I Seen a bright blue light flash across sky like a shooting star and disappeared.  I thought it was my eyes playing tricks, thought it could just be a shooting star, but tonight while sitting in my car and looking at the night sky, I saw a similar light about the size of a star/circular.  It was white light this time, shoot across sky and disappear... they both reminded me of shooting stars, very fast almost blurred.  Not sure, but I doubt shooting stars are that visible in LA with all the smog. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
