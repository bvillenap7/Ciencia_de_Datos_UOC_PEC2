Glowing orange light, much lower to the ground than any kind of aircraft.  Saw similar event on 12/31/99 - three lights at that time.;2000-04-13 05:30:00;30 + minutes;Glowing orange light, much lower to the ground than any kind of aircraft.  Saw similar event on 12/31/99 - three lights at that time. My boyfriend was leaving for work around 5:30 in the morning and called up to me from the apartment parking lot.  As I ran down the stairs, he was looking up at the sky, muttering What the hell is that?  A glowing orange light was hovering above us, much lower to the ground than any kind of aircraft.  He said it came from the eastern horizon, and by the time I got downstairs it was heading west.  At one point it actually appeared to slow down as it went over us.  We stared at it for approximately 5 minutes before he left for work.  I remained outside for another 5 minutes or so as it continued moving west over our apartment complex.  I left the house about 6:00 a.m., and it was still visible.  It began leaving a trail of light for lack of a better term.  It's like it was about to fizzle out, but never did. He and I and a few others experienced the same lights on 12/31/99.  There were three of them at that time.  I dismissed the event since there were quite a few fireworks in the area.  He kept insisting that we saw something quite unusual - I doubted him until this morning.  I have never experienced anything like it.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571

((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  Please see article.  PD)) ((BEGIN ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE ABOUT LAUNCH)) Air Force Test Missile Out West Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly, said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said. Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show. We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early, Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets. Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is, Gabel said. The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability. ((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS));37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571

New Years Eve in Antioch, California...1/1/08 at 12:05 AM Right after midnight on New Years Eve, my girlfriend, her daughter, daughter's boyfriend, and I saw four lights high up in the sky, mvoing slowly accross the sky. They traveled about halfway accross the sky and then disappeared. Then we saw another similar light. It stopped in the middle of the sky and just hung there for about five minutes, not moving, then disappearing. These lights were way up there, and were not planes, no blinking lights, and no sound. Daughter's boyfriend conjectured that they may have been some type of lit weather ballons.... But there were so many of them, and their flight pattern was so fixed.

UFO sighted over Antioch, CA 08/16/10 Stationary for 10 minutes.;2010-08-16 20:58:00;15 mins.;UFO sighted over Antioch, CA 08/16/10 Stationary for 10 minutes. Two of my friends and I had just arrived outside my friends apt. complex. We were waiting for one of my friends to get out of the car. while we were watching him take forever to get out, i noticed a very bright pulsating light in the sky directly lined up with his car just miles in the distance.(i'd say it was over the delta near travis air force base)Due North. One of my friends thought it was a planet the other thought it was a star going supernova. i'm well versed in my astronomy and told them that there was no star or planet in that direction (due North), especially none that bright. We watched as it sat completely still, hanging in the sky for about 5 mins when two men got out of their car and were going into the apt. complex so we stopped them and asked them if they thought that it looked like a helicopter. they said,hell no! that's a UfO. they watched it with us for about one minute and went inside. it was still stationary at this time and still very bright and pulsing. At that time two of our friends came out of the complex because one was getting a ride and the other was walking her out. As soon as they saw it one of the girls said that's a UFO, we didnt even tell her what we thought it was. The other girl saw it and ran into the house because she was afraid. The girl got her ride and we still sat watching it. The object then started to dim, then brighten, then go even more dim still. as it did this it moved slightly up, then stoppedslightly left, stopped and up once more and stopped. The whole time my two other friends were trying to call the people we knew in the apt., but none of there phones were working. We were thinking it was getting bigger for a moment, then i realized it was coming straight toward us. the object moved very slow and was completely silent. when it did reach us, it was 100% lined up with our position, i mean when we looked up it was not to the left or to the right, it was right on top of us! we waited for it to pass a little then ran inside our friends apt. to try and get them to come out to see it. they came out as it was nearly passing the apt. complex's walls. We watched it fly into the distance when it suddenly split into to separate lights with a good amount of distance between the two. we watched it until we couldn't see it any more. The whole experience lasted about 15-16 mins. After the experience was over my two friends that saw it the longest with me, and myself, felt very ill and shaky. After we went back inside we stepped out for a cigarette , this was about five minutes after we went in we saw a black stealth bomber, running below super sonic, flying in the exact same direction as the UFO. I checked MUFON's website the next day to see if anyone reported it. The stealth bomber was sighted slightly more south than my town, which is the direction it was heading, coming from the north. The object was not reported that night, but for the previous night there was a report of an object moving in the exact same pattern,(up,stop,left,stop,up,stop, and then flew right at them) just about 20 miles North of my town.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
4 ufo witnesses antioch ca;2012-01-25 21:00:00;5 minutes;4 ufo witnesses antioch ca I live in Antioch California.  At precisely at 9:25 at night my Mom came running in the house stating that there were Aliens in the sky. Curious but doubtful I walked to the front porch.  Once outside, I got the first glimpse of what I believed to be a UFO. There were four Red/Orange illuminated orb shaped objects.  A single orb disappeared as three began to form a triangle.  I  ran back inside shocked, amazed, and a little spooked.  That's when I briefly described it to my cousin Chad and my roommate Elly and my Mom.  Quickly convinced we all sprinted back to the porch in time to see the red/orange orbs drifting in  our direction heading West to East.  The three remaining orbs formed an Isosceles   Triangle with the high point of the triangle leading.  The lit up orbs were flickering the entire time.  It drifted to the point that it was almost right above us.  At the first glance there seemes to be a transparent craft causing blurred vision between the triangle points.  Almost as if the three triangle points were holding something together.  It continued East for a moment and one of the back orbs disappeared.  And the left back orb headed South and disappeared momentarily.  The tip orb of the triangle continued on East and disappeared within 40 seconds.  Ffreaky stuff. any questions reply back to;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
Red lights in triangle form flying in sky;2012-01-25 21:00:00;3 MINUTES;Red lights in triangle form flying in sky I was sitting in my room video chatting and I heard my roommate scream UFO!  I ran outside to join my roommates and looked up.  Sure enough I saw one reddish dot off in the distance if I was looking West towards Pittsburgh.  And closer to us there where three more red and orange dots traveling together in a Triangle formation.  They were changing between the two colors probably due to reflections.   They would not break formation and seemed to slowly disappear.  First one then the second.  You could almost see right through them as if they were turning inadvisable.   The last one kept going and I ran inside scared because my son was getting scarred because I had the computer in my hands still doing my video chat with my son.   I am not too much of a believer but I know those were not falling stars or air planes.  I'm not stupid so i know something is up with that!   That's not cool at all we're all pretty freaked out!

4 lights in the sky in a formation;2012-01-25 21:00:00;5 minutes;4 lights in the sky in a formation My cousin came in my room and said there was Alien UFOs in the sky.  At first I did not believe what he was saying at all.  But I got up and went outside anyway.  What I saw was 3 Blinking Lights and another one to the right below them.  It was coming from the West heading East.  At first all 4 were there then the bottom 4th light disappeared.  The other 3 went into (A) triangle formation.  Then the bottom light went out then the right bottom light went out.  So only the front light was there.  Out of no where a little light appeared from the right of the last light that was left. It past in front of the last light and moved from right to left. Then they all just disappeared. The color of the lights were orange and red. They were blinking and able to become translucent. bright flash in bellingham area. A flash of light lit my whole house.  My dog freaked out.  At the same time a friend who lives 15 miles away witnessed this same light and his dog freaked out aswell.   I was wondering if anyone else noticed this.  I have never seen a UFO and don't nessasarly beleive in them, but I can not think of another explaination.   My girlfriend has witnessed a similar occurance.  Winter lighting???

2 lights being chase by 2 fighters at night.;2012-10-09 08:10:00;3 minutes;2 lights being chase by 2 fighters at night. I was walking the dog when i looked up and saw a satellite so i thought. It was heading northeast and it was as bright as a planet.  Behind it about 3-4 miles was another lite but 1/3 smaller.  As it was heading more east now the bright lite was gone then the second one was gone within a second of the first.  I knew then it was not a plane cause it should have had blinking lights.   When i looked back to the same area that i first saw them i saw 2 fighter jets with blinking lights. I figure they came from Moffet field.  I figure that they might have been following the two objects that i saw.  They also headed northeast and kept going till i lost sight of the 2 planes. I am air force retired of over 20 yrs.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571

Red and blue lights in California seen moving fast in strait lines and slighly changing course.;2015-09-10 20:15:00;12 seconds;Red and blue lights in California seen moving fast in strait lines and slighly changing course. I just saw two UFO's.  Night, Sept 10th, 2015, at approx. 8:15 pm, Antioch, CA.  A red, round light and a blue, round light traveling directly east, from west.  I thought they were Mylar balloons at first, about 50 feet up, but traveling too fast and strait and the wind is coming more from the north/north west.   Then I thought “birds?” I thought they were balloons reflecting light from the street lamp.  I soon realized (about 1 second after they came out from behind my tree and about 3 seconds after first sight) they were not balloons or birds, as they had their own light source.    Then the red one changed coarse slightly but both kept moving quickly to the east in very strait paths.  When the red one changed course for a moment it seemed to be a very precise, yet playful movement.   They crossed overhead and out of sight towards the horizon in Antioch in about 10 to 12 seconds (total sighting including tree obstruction for 2 seconds).  They made no sound (that I could hear).  I was not sure how high up they were, so also not sure how big, but given the minimum distance they moved, they seemed to be going fast.  They seem to fade away before reaching a normal distance of low visibility and while still above the horizon impediments.  The sky is clear.   My neighbors are almost always on their front porch so I went across the street and asked them and one of them saw it too.  They exploded in a flurry of slightly intoxicated explanation and agreement that one of them had just mentioned it, saying, “I guess you’re not seeing things.”  The girl saw it as it was already well past the zenith and closer to the horizon.  She also said she only saw a blue one, which I thought was strange because they were only a few degrees apart after going into the distance, but that was from my line of sight, which should not have been much different than hers.  Maybe the red one faded out before the blue one, I do not recall.  It seemed to go one or two miles in! about 13 seconds, but that is guessing that it was as big as a house and about 600 to 1200 feet up.  It may have been 200 feet high, very hard to judge.  It looked about the size of a 20 inch balloon just above the telephone pole.  It was exciting.  So exciting, it may have happened in 6 or 7 seconds and just seemed like 10 or 12 seconds.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571

I looked up at the night sky and I noticed what looked like very faint satelite. Instead of just one like I usually see, there was at least 30 that i saw and they were headed in one direction, at the exact same speed, in a single file line but there were a few that werent. They were spaced apart evenly and there was no sound. There was no twinkling like stars. They were just dim points of light that looked exactly like a satellite.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571

They appeared to be moving in pairs of two.  They weren't blinking and seemed to appear out of one part of the sky and then disappear in another part.  They faded in one part of the sky and faded out in another. They were moving from West to East.  In all there were probably 15-20 pairs before the phenomena ended.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
