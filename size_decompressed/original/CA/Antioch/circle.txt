Peculiar lights over the Antioch, CA sky;2003-10-12 02:00:00;25 minutes;Peculiar lights over the Antioch, CA sky we were sitting and watching the stars and I notices what seemed to be a large circle of light moving to the left of the sky. I alerted other people in the car with me.I could tell it wasnt a star because it was so close to the ground it seemed like it was a little further than lone tree rd. It was moving consistenly to the left at a very slow slow pace and then it just stopped and hovered in the same place for about 10 min. Then another person came out and we showed him the light in the sky because we were tripping out. It wasnt blinking, like a plane it wasnt going fast like a shooting star it was moving and now hovering in the same place. Then almost as if it knew we were watching it moved to the left about 20 feet again but out of our site. We got out of the car, moved so we can see it again and then it moved again and hovered and all of a sudden we looked up and it was gone.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
Multiple red llights in a row sighted  from my home in Antioch , Calif.;2007-12-31 00:05:00;5 minutes;Multiple red llights in a row sighted  from my home in Antioch , Calif. On New Years Eve night me and three other friends went outside at midnight to bring in the New Year. We had some confetti we were trying to throw into the air and after I heard alot of fireworks go off in the distance.  That caught my attention to look to the left of me and I saw four reddish orange circular lights appear out of no where.  I told everyone else to look up to the left as well and we all saw the same thing.   We couldn't figure out what it was.  They were all four in a row .  Then all of the suddne a fifth one entered from the left side of the formation.  They stayed there for what seemed about five minutes then they all just disapeared at the same time into the dark like magic they were gone!!  It was quite strange.  Never had we seen anything like this.  However there have been quite a few sightings of other things in this general area of Antioch, Pittsburg , and Oakley, Calif.  A few friends of my family have actually had a UFO hover over them in their cars .  That was really strange as well.  They were so shook up they thought for sure they were going to be abducted.  Lots of real life stories out here.  I have had alot of ghosts in my houses out this way as well.  The police said they have even seen them and have had so many calls about strange things happening  in their homes.  My last home that a sold at least five more families have moved into it just to move out again.  I know why !!!;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
Orange over livermore Ca, viewed from antioch Ca;2011-06-10 23:20:00;3-4 minutes;Orange over livermore Ca, viewed from antioch Ca At extaclty 11.20 Pm I was outside on my balcony trying out my new app on my iPhone.  The app is star walk.  It's a clear night with a slight breeze. From my balcony I was looking straight up at the darkest part of the sky.  Then I looked straight ahead to the south to where the city of livermore is located my compass said it was 190* south.  I was looking at a bright part of the sky when I noticed a orange light with appeared like a star. I started to focus on the orange star like light, and I noticed it moving very slightly like it was wiggling.   After about a minute the light started to gain in altitude, it took about another minute to the ufo to reach its peak.  When the ufo reached its peak it started moving slowly to the right, and then its picked up speed heading to the southeast in a straight line.  I wouldn't say it had blazing speed but it was most defenatley way faster than an airplane.   I lost sight of the ufo when it keeped going right west.  In all it probably lasted about 3-4 minutes.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571

Red/Orange light in the sky.;2013-02-15 03:40:00;2 minutes;Red/Orange light in the sky. I went outside on the back porch to have a cigarette.  There is a blinking star to the right that I saw earlier in the night.  This time when I went out, there was a red/orange bright star-like object close to the blinking star.  There were no strobe lights or any other lights blinking on it.  I watched it to see if it was moving, and it was, very slowly.  It almost seemed to move and then wobble back and forth, but continued moving across the sky.  I kept watching it to see if there would be a strobe that would show up proving it to be an aircraft of some kind, but there never were any.  After about two minutes, it faded away;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
