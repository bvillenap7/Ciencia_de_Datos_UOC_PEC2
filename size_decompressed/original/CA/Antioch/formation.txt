I was driving home from school (Diablo Valley College)heading east bound on highway 4. I always look at the sky when I drive just to see if I can see anything out of the ordinary. Well this night I did. What I witnessed were three lights. They were larger than any star, and had a yellowish orange glow to them. They were in a triangular patern like an isoceles triangle, almost perfect. They seemed to bee about a kilometer up maybe less. They just sat there for about five minutes and then two of them on the northern most sides of the triangle took off so fast they seemed to be at a constant velocity, not acceleration, but velocity and were gone in a matter of seconds. The last one stayed and hovered for at least another ten minutes, but I wanted to go home and show my girlfriend so that I didn't think I was crazy. I was talking to her the whole time on the phone explaining what was happening. When I arrived at my house the last object was no longer visible. I know none of our aircraft with the ability to hover could have accelerated at the velocity that those two objects left at, it was just to fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
