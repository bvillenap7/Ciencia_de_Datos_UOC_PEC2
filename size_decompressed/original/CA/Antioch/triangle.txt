I saw a flash of light, the object moved erradically in one area, stabilized itself, then I saw another moving erradically;2007-03-27 23:01:00;6 minutes;I saw a flash of light, the object moved erradically in one area, stabilized itself, then I saw another moving erradically Alright, I was walking to my room and looked out the window and saw a bright light. I hadn't seen it before so I stared for about a minute, then it disappeared and a faint light appeared. The light was shaking erradically all around the area for about 3 minutes, I ran outside and watched as it then stabilized itself and started flying over my area. The UFO was a triangle shape and a light would flash on one point, then the next, then the third. Two of the lights were normal colored and the other was red. As I watched that one I looked past it and saw another light flashing erradically, got a little spooked, and went inside. I shook my head and blinked alot to make sure I wasn't seeing things.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
3 bright orange lights in a triangle formation hovering in the horizon.;2015-05-23 22:45:00;2-4 minutes;3 bright orange lights in a triangle formation hovering in the horizon. My husband and I were star gazing and were getting ready to go home when I looked NE and saw 3 bright orange lights in a triangle formation in the sky.  I grabbed my husband and told him to look and he was just as amazed as I was.  They started to spread apart from one another, still staying somewhat in a triangle shape and their brightness began to fade which lead to the one on the right/top to disappear and then slowly the other two did as well.  We could not believe what we had just experienced nor could we understand what they could have been.  We thought about what city they were hovering over and realized it was near Fairfield and thought maybe it could have had something to do with the Travis Air force Base but then we both shook our heads and NO WAY!!!  We both tried to video tape it with our cell phones but they were too far away. Safe to say this will be a night we will never forget, we both know that this was a once in a lifetime experience  and now when we look in the sky we wonder who or what could be out there!!!;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571

Possible TR3B's seen overhead in Antioch.;2020-09-03 22:53:00;10-15 seconds;Possible TR3B's seen overhead in Antioch. Observing sky with friend on 1416 West 18th St.  We're amazed as we saw two crafts accelerating in a straight line and one weaved to the left in a manner an aircraft could never ever do'.  They both continued West in the sky.  They looked like TR3B's.  Could it be Alcubierres Warp Drive testing?  Would sell my soul in a second to contribute to this area of life exceleration.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
