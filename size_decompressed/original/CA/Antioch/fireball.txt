First moving in an easterly direction, then turning north. I observed this object while driving home from work. I watched this thing for approximately ten minutes, while on hwy 4 east, between Pittsburg and Antioch. After driving into my driveway, I observed the object change direction to the north. At this time I ran inside the house and called my wife outside. My wife and I watched the object for another three to five minutes. The object moved slowly toward the San Juaquin river and began dropping smaller sparks over the river. I have 20 years experience in law enforcement, and flew helicopter patrol  (observer) I have seen many strange flying objects, but not like this.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571

Ca  Looked like shooting star but right to left.Slight left turn before gone. Went outside to view early morning stars in southeast sky when I saw what looked like a shooting star but was moving right to left instead of the typical north to south plunge.Before in vanished as shooting stars do,made a slight left angled turn.(kind of rules out the shooting star theory)Local news station reports bright green and yellow  lights in the sky that night witnessed by many.Strange thing is Channel 2 news reports it as a meteor at 9:00 p.m. or so.My sighting occured 4:50a.m. next morning. If anyone else saw what I saw let it be known.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
Two orange objects seen one dropping smaller orange lights underneath it.;2002-01-18 22:50:00;2 minutes;Two orange objects seen one dropping smaller orange lights underneath it. My fiance and I were walking from our house to our car and looked up in the north-western sky and saw an orange ball travelling westbound. As it was travelling, smaller orange lights were dropping from it. The smaller ights looked almost like sparks and we at first thought it was a flare from a flare gun. Once the object travelled out of site, a second identical object was seen coming from southern sky heading northbound. This object was not dropping smaller lights as the other one did though. While the first object was visible, my fiance ran in and grabbed our digital camera and several shots were taken of both objects. Unfortunately, the detail does not show up in the picturers.

Fireball Frequesntly Seen In Antioch CA;2002-01-26 18:52:00;30 Seconds;Fireball Frequesntly Seen In Antioch CA The instances of this fireball are becoming frequent in our area. My fiance and I have witnessed this fireball about 5 to 7 times now. I have filed a report on here once already for an event on 01/18/02. The same type of fireball object travelling across the sky, this time from east to west. Tonights siting, the object was moving extremely fast. I estimate about 500 NMPH. Altitude is too hard to determine at night. Also this siting tonight was not dropping sparks as the other sitings have done. This is driving us crazy trying to figure out what it is. But, since it is un-identified by us, we consider it a UFO. ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM WITNESS)) Peter, Thanks for responding. My Fianc√© and I saw this again tonight and we think we have determined it to be a type of flare. Tonight when we saw it, it seemed to fizzle out and we could see an object floating down thanks to the moon light we have tonight. I guess our only real mystery is who is sending a flare up on a regular basis.  Thanks again and if we ever do encounter anything that can not be explained, we will be sure to let you know, not to mention check your website now and then for some interesting sightings.

Fireball like object, dropping something then disappearing;2003-02-26 03:43:00;5 minutes;Fireball like object, dropping something then disappearing The object was a solid round orange fire like ball it moved across the sky in a strait line it didn't blink nor flash any lights but stayed a solid glowing orange.  Something expelled from the bottom of the light like a flare toward the earth and disappeared.  The object itself then began to flicker the orange light diappearing and reappearing until finally it was all togeather gone.  I've sighted this twice now within the space of a week.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
Fireball like object, dropping flare like objects then disappearing;2003-02-27 05:00:00;7minutes;Fireball like object, dropping flare like objects then disappearing The craft this morning was bright orange and seemed to be closer than last nights. It traveled across the sky dropping first one flare like object and then another which split into two objects before it disappeared.  This all happened at 5am this morning and lasted for about 7 minutes.  My daughter was with me and witnessed the entire thing.  We also noticed no planes but it was rather cloudy.  The flare like objects that fell from the Fireball were the same color with sparkling Fire-cracker like tails.  They faded before falling completely to the ground.  About 10 minutes after the sighting a helicopter was circleing the vacinity were we saw the fireball craft.  And I remember helicopters after the other craft sightings.  I believe these might be pre-ordained drops. But what's being dropped and Who or What is dropping it I'd sure like to know.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
3 fireballs dropping smaller balls of light seen in the north sky moving east over antioch california;2004-11-24 20:30:00;15 minutes;3 fireballs dropping smaller balls of light seen in the north sky moving east over antioch california e bright lights, red in color spaced equally apart. the lights were in a straight line at first moving in a upward and eastward direction. then the fist light stopped, and the other two continued on. they seemed to be dropping smaller balls of fire-like lights out of the bottom goig straight down. the dropped lights burned out shortly, about 5 seconds.  the two continued about halfway accross the sky moving higher as they went. one light stayed still for about 5 mins and dropped several of the little fireballs and them moved onward abruptly. a few moments later the light went out all together. the first one that had atayed in position slowly went out, like it burned itself out, slowly getting weaker and weaker. what would have been the middle light was still bright and strong and appeared to be very high in altitude, but still very bright. brighter than an airplane light or the brightest star in the night. the size of all three light were much larger than aircraft lights, like looking at a very big bonefire in the distance. the lights dropped from them were weaker in brightness, but you could clearly see the movement and the red glow. i would estimate they were at least as high as a comercial jet in the sky. this was whitnessed by my entire family as we were called outside by my uncle who was having a ciggerette break. every one could clearly see the movement, see the lights stop and hold position and see the lights dropp the other small er lights out of the bottom. the ages ranged from 8-70years. the location was the backyeard of my granparents house in antioch california, looking towards the north. the lights traveled in a northeasterly direction. the entire event lasted 15 to 20 mins. the lights started very bright and and low and as they dropped thier loads they grew weaker in color and brightness untill they went out all together.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
Bright red flash of light hovering over Fairfield/Antioch area;2007-01-04 22:46:00;2 minutes;Bright red flash of light hovering over Fairfield/Antioch area This is my first sighting and I am hoping that someone else will come forward to verify what I saw - others must have seen this!   At 10:46pm I was lying in bed trying to fall asleep.  On my right side is a sliding glass door and a balcony, my home is situated on top of a hill in Antioch with a very wide view of the Delta and Valley below.  My area of view was towards Rio Vista/Fairfield/Travis AFB. Anyways, I was lying there, and noticed that out in the distance (maybe a few miles) was this huge ball of blazing red light hovering - probably at like 5,000 feet altitude approx?  At the same time I heard a helicopter flying over my home (there is a hospital trauma center nearby and the emergency helicopters fly over sometimes)..... I thought that was the helicopter, then the helicopter passed right above me and I realized the red light was not the helicopter.....the red light object I saw was not making that noise.....  I got out of bed and walked out to the balcony.  It was a very clear night and I swear that it looked like a bright light, steady, very bright, just staying in one spot over the hills..... probably for about 2 minutes.  At first I thought it might be a space shuttle landing or possibly a plane that had exploded, but it was stationary and didn't move....so I knew it wasn't either of those. I stood there and all of a sudden it became a tiny white light (like a star) and dissapeared up and away towards the night sky until it was gone, almost instantly. I know that someone out there had to have seen this besides me.   I have never experienced anything like this and am kind of scared/interested in what happened.  I do not use drugs or drink, I am 31 yrs old.  Thanks.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571

I have never seen anything like it, before. I meant it was such the amazingly beautiful sight I have witnessed looking at such the distance that it was at.  It looked as if I could reach out and touch the sucker, where I was on the lanai smoking a cigarette when it shot right by me! Yes!  Nearly right pass my eyes, a block away from me!  It was so close to me for 10 seconds and vanished into where????  I wanted to see it again!  This is not a hoax! What was it????  How can this thing have made it to earth???  It looked like a shooting star, really up close and personal.  And if it was a star, again I ask, how did it make it to earth???  I thought earth was too far away for a star-like object to travel to. I do know it was not a UFO. I never told anyone but one person and we were on the subject on UFO sightings, a month later.  I had to tell him.  Frankly I absolutely DO NOT believe in any UFO‚Äôs at all nor do I believe in Alien like creatures.  I only believe in what I see.  And what I saw that night was of something not from earth. This is a night I will always cherish and remember for the rest of my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Fireball over Antioch California seen for 15-20 minutes travelling at varying speeds and making dramatic direction changes.;2015-07-28 01:15:00;15 minutes;Fireball over Antioch California seen for 15-20 minutes travelling at varying speeds and making dramatic direction changes I was driving eastbound on Hwy 4 on my home from work.  As I approached my exit, I saw an orange fireball in the sky.  It was moving unusually for any air plane.  I watched it as I drove to my house, pulling over twice because it was changing direction suddenly. When I arrived at my home, I called my son to come outside.  When I showed it to him, he was speechless.  We watched it for several minutes, now moving slowly north to south.  It suddenly stopped. It stayed in one place for a good 5 minutes.  I took a photo and video.  Then it drifted slowly to the west.  And then it disappeared but instantly reappeared far to the west within a second or two.  Then it started moving south and we could no longer see it.  We are both completely stunned by what we saw. When I look at the enlarged photo, it boggles my mind.  We could tell this thing appeared to be spinning and that is evident in the picture.  I can also see what appear to be lights!;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
