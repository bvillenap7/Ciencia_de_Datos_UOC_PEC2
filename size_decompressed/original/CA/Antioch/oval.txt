Red and green lights moving over the sky.;2017-08-13 21:00:00;15 minutes;Red and Green lights moving over the sky. My husband and daughter and I were sitting in the backyard around 9:00, waiting to watch for the meteor shower, when a red light, traveling in the flight pattern (west to east), came up.   My husband asked what it was, I thought it was a helicopter but it made no sound, and as it passed over our house, there were no blinking lights, and it appeared to be oval in shape.   A few seconds later, another light appeared, this time green.  This repeated over a 20 minute period when another red light appeared then a white light appeared then another red.  These lights moved in the same way a helicopter would and seemed about the same distance from the ground.  Again, all lights were silent.  We saw 1 red, and 1 green light about 2 nights before this, as well. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Good Morning Mr. Davenport, The time was 2100 hours.  The objects appeared to be moving from west to east with a local flight pattern.  They  seemed to be about the size of a helicopter.  There were no noticeable winds or changes as they went by and they were silent.  I will try to get further information.  They were bright like LED lights but they were not moving like balloons or anything.  They moved similarly like a helicopter would and at about the same altitude.  Very consistent. I hope this helps.  I will forward further information as it is obtained. ((END ADDENDUM));37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
