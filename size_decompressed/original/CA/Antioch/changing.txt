a circular fire ball shaped object is going up into the sky very quickly;2018-08-28 03:30:00;In front of home in the s;It was approximately 3:30 AM here in Antioch, California. I was on my front porch with my fiancé and I look directly in front of me and there is a tree in front of my home and I look up above the tree and suddenly a circular fire ball shaped object is going up into the sky very quickly  and at first I did not know what exactly it was because it was happening so fast I told my fiancé to look quickly hurry and look quickly and suddenly the fire ball shaped object stopped in the middle of the sky and then it began to head off and change shape and to the opposite direction across the sky and it changed shape into some kind of saucer or object  with jet thrusters on each side but in the middle it had an oval shape and it was blinking 4 to 5 lights or six lights very quickly, very quickly, different colored lights, very quickly it was not of a man-made flying device it was across the sky within 20 to 30 seconds completely across the sky and gone it was amazing I a! m in shock... I hope I am able to see this event again one day and if I am not I will never forget that moment in my life ever. My fiancé tried to record it on his cell phone but he did not have a very good image visual but our voices were recorded over it during the time of the event.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
