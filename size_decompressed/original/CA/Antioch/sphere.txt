2 glowing orbs in Antioch, California.;2014-06-28 23:00:00;2 minutes;2 glowing orbs in Antioch, California. So I'm driving home at around 11 pm Saturday night and I see two glowing orange spheres in my 11 o'clock position which appeared to be hovering I couldn't really tell how far away they were but out of nowhere I was watching them and they just disappear out of nowhere it sent chills through my whole body my girlfriend seen the same thing in January but I really didn't believe her in the same area but she said there were six of them I don't know what these things are but I would like to know I know a few different people who don't know eachother that have described seeing the same objects;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
