Teardrop object in the sky.;2014-10-21 10:30:00;2 seconds;Teardrop object in the sky. I was laying on the grass looking up.  I saw bugs, birds and airplanes flying by.  Then I saw a white teardrop object that went straight, stop and then do a 90 degree turn up then stop and then another 90 degree right turn and sped off.  It did a reverse Z but with straight lines.  I figure that it was going about 4-5 thousand miles per hr. or more.   I am retired air force and I have seen all types of planes, but nothing that fast.  Oh, the sky was blue.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
FLOATING WHITE OBJECTS ABOVE MT.DIABLO FOOTHILLS IN CA;2016-09-26 12:30:00;10 minutes;FLOATING WHITE OBJECTS ABOVE MT.DIABLO FOOTHILLS IN CA My husband and I saw 2 white objects high in the sky, through binoculars there appeared to be a tail with another smaller white part attached.  They moved across the sky, then stopped on one area above the foothills before movi ng more to the southwest.  Did have similarities to small parachute perhaps a weather balloon that had burst...just not something we could discern.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
