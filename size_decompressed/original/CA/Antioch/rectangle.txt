Rectangle Over Antioch;1981-10-31 19:00:00;2-3 minutes;Rectangle Over Antioch I was 14 years old, it was Halloween and I was sitting on the porch handing out candy.  There hadn't been any trick-or-treaters in a while so I was watching the sky out of boredom when I saw the UFO flying almost directly overhead in a generally northern direction.  It was very large, I would guess roughly the size of a football field.  The entire bottom side was glowing lightly and there were 4 brighter circular light sources closed to each corner.  It passed overhead slowly, taking about 2 or three minutes to pass by.  It appeared to be only a few hundred feet above the ground.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
