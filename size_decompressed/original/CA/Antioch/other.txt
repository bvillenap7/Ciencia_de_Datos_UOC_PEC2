Extremely bright green object, with red lights and a strob, randomingly changing its position in the sky.;2001-03-12 22:30:00;1 hour;Extremely bright green object, with red lights and a strob, randomingly changing its position in the sky. On the way home from the grocery store I notice an extremely bright and pulsating light above the foothills of Mt. Diablo.  I have never seen anything quite like this.  At first, I thought that it must be a plane as we have a lot of air traffic in our area.  But the object did not move, it just seemed to hoover there in the sky.  As I tried to keep my eyes on the road and watch the object at the same time, I noticed that it appeared to have colored lights, in a random blinking type pattern. Then I thought it had to be a star.  After I got home I checked to see if the object was visible from my backyard and it was.   So, I quickly unloaded my groceries, grab my binoculars and went into the backyard for a better look.  Through the binoculars, I could definitely see that the object was trianfular in shape with primarily bright green lights, it had sort a strob light coming off the left hand side and then there was a red light that seemed to travel in a circular path, counter clockwise around center of the object. It remained stationary for about 15 minutes, then it traveled very quickly up and to the right to a new position.  It remained there in its new position for another span of time, then quickly darted down and to the left, to another position in the sky.  The object did not move along with the other stars in the sky. I went inside and got my husband out of bed, I felt like I needed someone else to say that I what I was looking at was really there.  He watch the object  with me for about 15 minutes and finally said, Humm, that's kind of wierd isn't.  The object stayed primarily in the same vacinity for more than an hour, making sharp, sudden and random changes in its position.   I finally went inside as it was getting late but my curiousity got the better of me and I had to go back out and check to see if the object was still there.  Only about 15 minutes had passed by since I came inside the house and when I return to my backyard to look at the object one more time, it had vanished.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571

Objects in sky over Antioch California 12:03AM January 1,  2010;2010-01-01 00:03:00;30 Minuets;Objects in sky over Antioch California 12:03AM January 1,  2010 Three minuets after midnight we went outside in our backyard to pop fireworks. I looked up and seen what appeared to be an Airplane flying overhead. I ignored it for a few seconds, then looked back and saw that it had seemed not to move. I noticed there were no blinking lights on it, and It also was orange in color. We often see airplanes overhead heading North and sometimes in the East. This was different much slower and no sound. I went and got my Video Camera and started filming. As I watched it, I walked toward the back of my yard and could see another one over the top of my house. Then I noticed they were moving very slowly because as I stood still I could see the change in height compared to the top of my roof. They seem to be five spheres or lights together in an arc. The middle light being the biggest, getting smaller toward each side. As I watched and filmed another appeared coming from the same southern location in the sky moving in a straight line! . I filmed one near the Moon as the other two rose in the sky. Then the one near the Moon disappeared fading out as I watched. Then I noticed as I watched each faded as I watched them get higher in the sky from over the top of my roof to above my head. But I started to realize by the time the fifth one appeared it had rose from the south but was disappearing more to the west and not directly overhead anymore. To me this meant it may have been moving outside of the earth’s atmosphere, and the earth was moving below them. Each faded out to the naked eye as they past slowly overhead. But if I used my night vision on my video camera I could still see them as they faded away. This was seen by my wife and two children ages nine and ten. 4-1/2 minutes of my video is posted on Youtube “Objects in sky over Antioch 12:33AM Jan 1 2010”.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
Speedy orange oddly shaped ufo during twilight;2018-04-03 00:05:00;1-2 minutes;Speedy orange oddly shaped ufo during twilight Tuesday, April 3, 2018, 12:05 AM.  Twilight.  My fiancé were driving on a popular road in our city.  As we are driving we see an orange ball in the skies headed towards us.  Literally seconds later, the object is hovering above us at least 100 feet from landing.  It made no sound at all.  The object resembled like orange octopus shaped light with 3 legs/tentacles on each side up close.  Its motion and movements as it hovered were as graceful as a jellyfish.  Seconds later it ascends back into the sky flying in all sorts of spontaneous angles.   We follow it for a few seconds, and then poof like magic, it disappears into the night sky. Something I will never forget in life.  Amazing and chilling all in one.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
