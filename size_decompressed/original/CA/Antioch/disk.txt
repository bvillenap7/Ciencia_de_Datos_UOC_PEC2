Three metallic looking objects found in sky over Antioch on morning of 9/15/04.;2004-09-15 06:55:00;5 min;Three metallic looking objects found in sky over Antioch on morning of 9/15/04. Three objects in the sky right as the sun was rising, spaced maybe 1/2 to 1 mile apart from each other. I was driving toward the sunrise. They were very bright, metallic looking, almost as if there were four very bright lights on the bottom of the object.  They looked as if they were maybe a mile away from where I was, although that is hard to determine because I don't know how big they really were.  The objects did not move and as I got closer, they got larger. As I was stopped, I saw them in the same position and used a tree as a measurement to movement.  They did not move.  I continued to watch them for at least 5 minutes.  I pulled over to take a picture and they disappeared out of thin air.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
