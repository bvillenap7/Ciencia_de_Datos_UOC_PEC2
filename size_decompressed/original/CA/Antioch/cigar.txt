My Loc: N37 59.xxx',  W121 49.xxx', Elev.: 110 ft. I viewed an Unusual Flying Object at 1:59 A.M. traveling eastbound from the city of Pittsburg, traveling eastbound towards the Antioch bridge/City of Oakley.  It was red-orange and looked like a small planet or fireball at first.  When it flew over head, it appeared to be oblong, larger than a small airplane and flying about the same altitude of a small airplane cruising low to land.  The glow of the object made it impossible to identify, almost like an entire plane was engulfed in fire, but holding a consistent altitude.  It’s sound was low, unlike an airplane and resembled a  pulse.   After it was out of view, I ran back into the house and called 911 to see if there were any other reports.  The operator checked with the sheriff’s office and said there was no boat distress flares reported.  I guess, when I described it flying, the operator decided it was a flare since I didn’t describe the size or just thought I was out of my mind  and  didn’t want to be part of an U.F.O. report.;37.9809899159664;-121.791171428571
