2 white lights, one red and another white light in a line found over Tracy in the evening.;2007-09-16 20:30:00;A few minutes;2 white lights, one red and another white light in a line found over Tracy in the evening. I was riding home with my family on 580 going southeast from livermore to modest. After spending the last few minutes, we left my grandma's house and we left livermore, heading home for modesto at about 8:30 pm.  About halfway through the section of the freeway, i look up at the stars and see planes flashing their lights. But something else caught my eye. Naturaly, I couldn't see it because it was dark, but I saw 3 white lights in a line with a red light. the order was white, white, red, white, all in a line. The lights were glowing, unlike the triangular flashing lights of a plane. It either was staying still or moving very slowly.  My mom did notice it and asked if it was a plane. I knew it couldn't be a plane because everyone knows a plane has flashing lights, not glowing lights. Its also was not a communications tower like you would find in the mountains near Tracy. I dont have a photo or a video, all I know is, it was a UFO. If it wasn't, then what was it?;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
