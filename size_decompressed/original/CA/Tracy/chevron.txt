I was outside watching my nephew play ball and he looked up and asked why the bright light was on the plane. I looked up and began telling him that it was for them to see in the dark and noticed a bright l.e.d like red and blue constant light emitting from a V shaped object. I watched it for about three minutes and then received a call from my mother, who is a paramedic, and she told me that her crew was witnessing the same thing. I told her I was watching it too then proceeded to call the Police to witness it. I kept watching it until it started to travel towards Livermore, Ca then turned around and came back towards where I was. I watched it make a 180 degree turn without even slowing down then do the same thing again and head back to Livermore where I lost the object.;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
