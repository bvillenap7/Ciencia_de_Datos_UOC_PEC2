The sky was a little stormy but there was a clearing in it just ahead.  In the clearing I saw what a I thought was a airplane leaving behind chemtrails.  When I looked closer I saw that the chemtrails weren't getting longer.  The whole object, shaped like a sideways teardrop, was moving right to left (north to south).  It moved slowly, about the speed of an airplane and was a tan or off-white in color;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913

We we're emerging onto the freeway on 580 south towards Livermore.  When suddenly my sister noticed something and pointed at the sky in which we both looked up and saw a green ball of light falling down and then suddenly vanished behind the clouds.  It only lasted around 3 seconds no more than 5.  The thing that intrigued us the most was that it popped out of nowhere and then suddenly vanished into thin air.;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
