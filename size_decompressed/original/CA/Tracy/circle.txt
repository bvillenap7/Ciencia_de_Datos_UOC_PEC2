6 unidentified crafts seen by 5 people;2010-10-28 19:27:00;15 minutes;6 unidentified crafts seen by 5 people I witnessed an undetermined flying space craft. I live in Tracy, CA and the occurrence happened near Mac Arthur Blvd. and Valpico Rd.  The ship had these lime green lights on it and was hovering in the air at approximately 7:25pm-7:40pm on October 28th 2010.  The craft was flying in a really weird pattern that a plane could not. It was circling around and flipping upside down, then pausing and staying in one spot for a long period of time almost like hovering.  I am not the only person who witnessed it, there was another car parked that was taking pictures and just as curious as I was.  Unfortunately I didnâ€™t receive their names or numbers at the time cause I was on my way to pick up my friend and they left right before I did. I wish to know what this ship was. About an hour later my friend and I stepped outside and witnessed 5 more unidentified ships in the same area I saw the first ship.  We were in such astonishment that by the time we were walking back to my house to get a camera they started to scatter and disappear.  I never really believed 100% in space ships before now, but I am completely convinced now because there is no other explanation.  The shape were more circular and the places the lights were placed were NOWHERE near what an airplane would have them.  I really think that this needs to be explored more.;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
