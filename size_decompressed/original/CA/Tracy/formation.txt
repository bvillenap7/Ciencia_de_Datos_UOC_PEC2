Several formations of lights flying high in the sky at night over California. ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-25 21:25:00;10 minutes;Several formations of lights flying high in the sky at night over California. They looked to be traveling at the same speed that you ca On my porch in Tracy California looking to the West over the ultimate hills towards the East Bay. Started seeing several lights In the distant night sky flying past a really bright star in the Western sky. They were following one another at a 45&#65439 angle to the North. After about 30 seconds of watching this formation another group of 3 to 4 also started flying up in the night sky above this star and to the North. After standing there for at least a minute or 2, Another group have at least 4 to 5 lights went flying up into the night sky pass the star in the West to the North. I then called my wife to the front porch where she also sat there with me for several minutes and watched 2 more groups of 2 to 3 lights go off up into the night sky in the West past the star headed North. I am prior military and know what jets flying high look like. I also know what missiles that have been launched into the sky look like. I have never seen anything like this in my ! life.;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
