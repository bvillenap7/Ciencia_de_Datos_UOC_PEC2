Peter, I will give you a brief background about my parents whom I sent you an email about there story earlier today. My father is retired, 68 years of age and was a heavy construction mechanic for 35 years. Dad designed and built numerous pieces of equipment used in the highway construction industry. Also, Dad is an atheist, no religious background of any kind! My mother, 62 years of age, was a part time cook and a full time mother, Catholic, and a strong belief in God. My parents live approximately 15 miles south of Tracy, California and have resided there for 22 years. They have a walnut orchard and it is located very close to interstate I-5 and Highway 132. On or around October 30, 1999, at about 8:00 p.m. both my parents where in the backyard sitting in their hot-tub. My mother looks to the south behind their orchard and observes two enormously large, what appeared to be circular objects with blinking red lights hovering approximately 500 feet in the air. The craft were spaced about 200 feet apart. They hovered in this position for between 60 and 90 seconds and there was no sounds at all heard coming from these craft. One craft then sped North over there home and the other went due East. When the craft left the area, they left at an unbeliveable speed, no sound what so ever heard, and the red lights that where observed changed to white when they departed. Both my parents are at a loss to explain what they witnessed and are even fearful to come forward to tell their story. They have never seen anything like this before and do not want to be percieved as crazy! But, this event forever changed their belief as to what may exist in our planet. They do not know if what they observed was alien, or, was some type of top secret military aircraft.;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
The object seemed to dissipate at certain points and then reappear in a different spot in the sky. As if moving so fast that it became;2001-06-20 15:00:00;5 minutes;It was late aternoon,midsummer, me and my father were out on the balcony of his apartment smoking a cigarette. I was leaning on the rail looking out at the horizon while my father was complaining about his girlfriend at the time. I noticed some strange movement on the horizon. I was hard to tell what it was until it stopped very abruptly and hovered. I'd say it was approximately 1 mile away. It was white or possibly reflective in color. It was saucer shaped and made no discernable sound. It was moving in an erratic horizontal pattern from my vantage point. The object seemed to dissipate at certain points and then reappear in a different spot in the sky. As if moving so fast that it became invisible to the naked eye. It did this repeatedly for approximately five minutes. It would dart across and then hover, then dart back in the other direction. I personally watched it for about a minute or so and then pointed it out to my father who comfirmed that he was seeing the event as I was seeing it. We watched it for 3 or 4 more minutes and then the object dissipated one final time and was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
15 meters brilliant silver object slowly floats then zips away on a  clear day - gone in a fraction of second;2004-05-08 14:10:00;3-4 seconds;15 meters brilliant silver object slowly floats then zips away on a  clear day - gone in a fraction of second I was driving a BMW with a passenger along the I-5 freeway near Tracy, a couple miles from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)at 2:10pm when suddenly, emerging from the clouds, approximately 1 mile away and 1/2 a mile up a silvery object, due to its brilliance,  caught my attention against a backdrop of white stratocumulus, slightly to the right of my car. The object was easily visible from near perfect sky.  Thinking that the object was perhaps a cargo plane, I banked to the left lane and immediately ask my passenger if there was any air traffic in the vicinity other than the object. The reply was negative. As I completed the lane change, the unknown object suddenly appeared at my 1 o'clock position (no more than a mile away) to change shape. And it was definitely not a cargo plane. The upper section, not concealed by any cloud, was gray, and on the lower section there appeared to be one or two reflective bright silver panels. The object was approximately 13 to 15 meters in diameter. Suddenly it accelerated and vanished from what I believe was a slow moving position. We gave chase but the object was gone. An animation is created for a clearer picture. You can see it here. http://autotails.tripod.com/ufo/ufo.htm;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
Flashing circular object.;2019-07-16 00:17:00;10;Flashing circular object I was 12:17 midnight as i was looking out my window, i seen an object flashing in the same spot without moving.  Suddenly it began to move very slowly i started taking pictures and video recording it.  The object flashed and moved very slowly it made 5 circles in the same spot from some pictures its clear but still canâ€™t really make the shape.  It had three flashing lights off and on and as it moved it moved at different altitudes.  At the same time an airplane went by and the airplane flew in one direction with the its lights and a red light this one was very different.  It seem as circular object with 3 flashing lights moving very slowly.  From the pictures, it doesn't look human like.;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
