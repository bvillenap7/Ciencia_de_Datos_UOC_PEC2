Then from the south, came a small orb.  Seemed to very high in the sky, it proceeded north until it suddenly then followed the other craft west bound. This one was much slower.  It would pause briefly.  It would also do a small circle and then proceed onwards.  This took place over 5 minutes until it was out of my sight.;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
