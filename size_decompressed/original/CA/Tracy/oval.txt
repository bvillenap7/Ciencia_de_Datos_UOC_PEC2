it was an oval shape brighty lit no sound blinking lights underneath;2005-10-26 09:45:00;15 minutes;it was an oval shape brighty lit no sound blinking lights underneath my daughter who is 11 years of age went to the wal mart store in tracy calif. with my other 23 year old daughter and her 2 year old baby.   they got on the car and were driving away when my 11 year old turned around to the back seat to give the baby a french fry and something caught her eye  and she yelled to the driver oh my god what is that?   my 23 year old looked up and said  oh my god i don't know.  they said it was pretty low flying..  they raced home she did not even even turn off her headlights or turn the car off they ran in the house and said hurry up come outside,  they were pretty flustered.   my son who is 16 and myself went to the front yard and looked up it was unbelievable i told my son quick go get the binoculars he came back out looked up and said words i can not type,  we all looked through the binoculars we all saw the same thing i still can,t get over it.  it was oval completely lit up and colored lights going around underneath it was moving fairly quickly then an airplane came close the disk slowed, then it went further away it was cloudy so it got to a point where we could not see it anymore.  i was not a person who ever believed in this sort of thing but i have to wonder now.  my daughter was scared  but the rest of us were very excited. we know what we saw we all drew similar pictures seperatly but they all looked the same.;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913

04/21/2013  04:45 oblong orange/yellow bright light traveling west to east in Tracy, CA for 30-60 seonds, then disappeared;2013-04-21 04:45:00;30-60 seconds;04/21/2013  04:45 oblong orange/yellow bright light traveling west to east in Tracy, CA for 30-60 seonds, then disappeared On Sunday, April 21, 2013 my husband and I were arriving home early morning around 4:45 a.m. I looked up to see the stars in the very clear sky (no clouds) and saw a very bright orange/yellow light in an oblong shape slowly passing over my house in Tracy, CA.  Since I am a retired flight attendant, I would say it was abaout 6,000 ft. up.   My first thought was it could be an aircraft on fire and slowly descending.  It was not moving fast like a meteor or shooting star but at a medium pace like an airplane.  It was  moving from west to east in the sky.  There was no tail or wing lights just a large oblong light.  There was no engine sound like other aircraft that we have heard before.  Not a helicopter or airship to my knowledge.  We both watched it for approximately 30 to 60 seconds.   My husband tried to take a picture with the cell phone to no avail.  The strange thing that makes me still feel uneasy, towards the end of its journey the light started to fade.  Then to our astonishment it disappeared completely into the night sky. I went into the house and returned about a half hour later because I couldn't believe what I saw and then didn't see.  I thought maybe there was a cloud cover.  Dawn was starting to break and the sky was as clear as could be.;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
