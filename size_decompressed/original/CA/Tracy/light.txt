At about 2am, I was obseving a small plane being followed by a red ball of light as the plane was trying to land. The plane was invading the UFO.  The plane did not land instead it went full throttle heading towards San Francisco.  The red ball of light went towards the Tracy mountain. I would like to find the pilot of that plane to confirm my story.;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
LIGHT IN THE SKY IS MET BY ANOTHER LIGHT AND 3RD LIGHT IS RELEASED FROM ORIGINAL LIGHT TO FOLLOW THE SECOND LIGHT.;2001-08-22 22:00:00;8 mins;LIGHT IN THE SKY IS MET BY ANOTHER LIGHT AND 3RD LIGHT IS RELEASED FROM ORIGINAL LIGHT TO FOLLOW THE SECOND LIGHT. I SAW A LIGHT IN THE SKY FOR THE 3RD NIGHT IN A ROW.  I THOUGHT IT WAS A STAR BUT IT WAS VERY BRIGHT. THE PREVIOUS 2 NIGHTS IT DISAPPEARED AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES SO THEN I KNEW IT WASN'T A STAR. SO THE 3RD NIGHT I STARTING TO FILM IT, IT WAS TOWARD THE WEST.THIS LIGHT WILL BE CALLED LIGHT A. AFTER FILMING IT FOR A COUPLE MINUTES ANOTHER LIGHT FLEW UP TO IT FROM THE LEFT SIDE AND STOPPED NEXT TO IT, LIGHT B. I AM LABELING THEM TO MAKE IT EASIER TO EXPLAIN.  THEN LIGHT B FLEW BACK AWAY TO THE BOTTOM LEFT DIRECTION IN A STRAIGHT SUDDEN MOVEMENT, THEN WENT TO THE RIGHT UNDER NEATH THE ORIGINAL LIGHT A AND B WENT STRAIGHT UP SO KNOW THERE A NEXT TO EACH OTHER. THEN A THIRD LIGHT CAME OUT OF LIGHT A , LIGHT C AND STOPPED IN BETWEEN A AND C. SO NOW THERE ARE 3 LIGHTS ALL NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN THE SKY.  WHEN YOU ZOOM IN ON THESE LIGHTS THERE WAS A GREEN FLASHING LIGHT ON TOP AND A RED FLASHING LIGHT ON BOTTOM. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN AIRPLANE BUT THESE THINGS DIDNT MOVE LIKE AN AIRPLANE. THEN AFTER ALL THREE SAT NEXT TO EACH OTHER FOR ABOUT 2 SECONDS. LIGHT B TOOK OFF ACROSS THE SKY AND LIGHT C FOLLOWED IT. WHEN THESE LIGHT TOOK OFF THEY WENT EAST OVER MY HEAT INTO THE OTHER HORIZON AND THEY COVERED THE WHOLE SKY IN A SPLIT SECOND. SO KNOW LIGHT A IS STILL THERE WHERE IT ALWAYS WAS.  BUT THEN WE NOTICED THAT LIGHT A IS KNOW SETTING LIKE A SUN. THIS ONE APPEARS TO BE IN THE EARTHS ORBIT, LIKE A SATELIT. SO WHAT I GOT OUT OF THIS WAS. LIGHT A IS EITHER A SATELITE, OR A UFO ROTATING THE EARTH LIKE A SATELITE, AND LIGHT B CAME UP TO IT, COMMUNICATED TO IT AND SAID FOLLOW ME, SO LIGHT A LAUNCHED SOMEATHING OUT OF IT TO FOLLOW LIGHT B. AND AGAIN WHEN B AND C TOOK OFF ACROSS THE SKY IT WAS AT A SPEED THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE. THIS EVENT WAS IN THE WEST ABOUT 45 DEGREES IN THE HORIZON AND WHEN B AND C TOOK OFF THE WERE OUT OF SIGHT IN THE EAST HORIZON IN NO MORE THAN A SECOND.;37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913

Strange lights over Tracy, California.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;5 minutes;Strange lights over Tracy, California. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD)) I was driving down N. Chrisman Road toward the Tracy Defense Depot a little after 6 p.m. on Nov. 7. I saw three white lights in the night sky configured in a triangle.  They looked like an airplane.  There were other lights from airplanes in the sky, except there was a powerful cone of light shooting down toward the ground from these three lights. I thought maybe I was watching a police or military helicopter searching for something on the ground. Inside the cone of light were blue and green beams that looked like maybe they were from a powerful spotlight.  The beams were tracking the three lights and I couldn't tell if the beams were from spotlights on the ground or being beamed down from the lights. I could see lights from what looked like an airliner in front of the three lights and I thought maybe the airliner was towing some kind of device with a powerful spotlight on it. Except the three lights kept going higher and higher in the sky as the airliner flew! west toward the Bay Area. I pulled over in the dirt on W. Schulte Road before the depot. The sky was glowing green where I had first seen the three lights over the depot, except the three lights were high in the distance now headed up and to the west. They now looked like a single star like the other stars in the sky, except a faint cone of light was shooting down from it almost looking like a comet. My phone couldn't get a picture and the lights were fading higher and higher. The green glow in the clouds was still there to the south over Tracy. I tried to keep my eyes on the lights as I entered town but they disappeared in the sky behind the city lights. First time in my life I have ever seen anything like it.
