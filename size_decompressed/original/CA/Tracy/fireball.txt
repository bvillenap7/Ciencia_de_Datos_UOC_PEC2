Fireball Over Tracy, California.  ((NUFORC Note:  Reported to be re-entering Chinese rocket shell.  PD));2016-07-27 21:50:00;2 minutes;Fireball Over Tracy, California. Fireball (comet like) flew towards the east over Tracy, California.  Watched it travel low across the sky and as I watched it, noticed that it extended from yet one fireball, but two, yet joined together.  Fascinating to see and could not see how far it traveled or if it even landed or burned out. ((NUFORC Note:  Reported to be re-entering Chinese rocket shell.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.7266087591241;-121.465240875913
