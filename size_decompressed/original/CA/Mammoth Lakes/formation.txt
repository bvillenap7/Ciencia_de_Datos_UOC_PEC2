Strange lights in formation, could have been a single object.;2006-02-16 23:30:00;1.5 min.;Strange lights in formation, could have been a single object. I was the passenger in a car driving North on Hwy. 395 next to Crowley Lake.  I happened to look out the window to the East when a red flashing light caught my eye.  The first thing I noticed was the cadence of the blinking.  It was like nothing I had every seen before.  Then I noticed two more identical flashing lights behind and off to the sides in a triangular shape. Now the first light was visible out the windshield of the vehicle.  I said something to my friend (the driver), and he craned his neck to look at the light.  As he noticed the strange light, it banked left across our path heading West.  He mentioned at this time that he saw four blinking lights in a huge trapezoid formation.  After a few seconds I also noticed the forth set of lights.  The objects (or object) was directly in front of us around a mile away and approximately 15,000 to 20,000 vertical feet.  As the lights moved to the West it stayed in perfect formation and appeared to be one huge object.  But I could not confirm this.  If this were one object, the shear size of it is mindblowing.  The lights slowly disappeared to our West obscured by Mt. McGee and the Eastern Sierra's.  The whole incident lasted around a minute and a half.  There was a steady stream of traffic heading North on 395 that night.  There must have been others to witness this, but I have not come across other reports yet.;37.6094;-118.8656
