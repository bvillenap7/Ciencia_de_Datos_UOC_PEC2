UFO captured in a video moving in the sky above Mammoth Lakes California;2019-06-28 08:45:00;5 seconds;UFO captured in a video moving in the sky above Mammoth Lakes California We were on vacation in Mammoth Lakes California and on our last day Friday, June 28 we decided to drive up to take some pictures of the waterfall and the snow on the mountains south of Lake Mary. It was about 8:30 AM and we took some pictures of the waterfall but it was really cold and windy so we kind of were in a hurry and went back and got in the truck and started to drive away when I stop the truck because I wanted some pictures with the truck in front of the lake that’s when I got out walked across the street took some pictures with the lake in the background. It wasn’t until Saturday, June 29 evening I was sitting on the couch looking at my iPhone and the pictures I took when I noticed a neon blue spot in the sky on one of the pictures I thought it might be a reflection and almost deleted the picture but I zoomed in to see what it was that’s when I noticed it Looked like some kind of craft and had details like lights or whatever they are evenly spaced along the edges and underneath the craft. This was not a reflection or water drop or anything else but a well measured out craft with well measured out features in even distances from each other. The picture was taken with my new iPhone In live mode so it captures a three second video combined with a still photo and when I swiped to see the picture I could see this was moving like a blue laser pen wiggling on a wall moving all over the place up down back-and-forth never in a straight line or flight path. I downloaded the app called Lifey it allows you to take these live shots and save them as a MOV file to see the video and what I saw is incredible! this craft moves all over the place like a pinball never in a straight path it moves up down backwards sideways forwards diagonal just like if you were to wiggle a laser light on a wall. In the video the craft appears from the dense clouds at ridge line of the mountain range south of Crystal Crag Lake and then it continues to rise up to a higher altitude and move around and the recedes backward towards the clouds south of the ridge line of the Eastern Sierras, At 10,364 feet, Crystal Crag is a dramatic and rugged mass of rock that is a recognizable landmark on the Mammoth Crest. The crag is a popular destination among mountaineers and climbers and sits above Lake George Mary and Crystal Lake. When you see the video you can see why this was not something I noticed because I was looking at the cellphone screen it came in went so fast I just happen to be in the right place at the right time and pushed the live picture button at exactly the right moment to capture this amazing craft and it erratic movements in a Live shot giving me the really awesome video.;37.6094;-118.8656
