Point that would shift left or right as it slowly moved downward.;2003-09-19 20:00:00;5 minutes;Point that would shift left or right as it slowly moved downward. Around 8:00 pm in the Inyo National Forest in the Sierras while watching stars we observed a light slowly moving downwards from its first observed point around 30 degrees up from the horizontal in the southern sky.  The light had a slight reddish tinge and looked like a faint star or satellite.  As it slowly moved downward towards the tree line, it would would jog slightly to the left or to the right and then jog back to approximately the original downward line it was following.  These left and right shifts were irregular in terms of distance and frequency.  The greatest sideways displacement was approximately 1/8 degree.  The downward speed was not completely constant.  After a few minutes it started to fade and then completely disappeared a few degrees from the treeline.  This was observed on a very clear night in the mountains and would have been completely hidden by city lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Date above is flawed.  We  believe it to be 19SE03.

Bright, silent light moving across the sky;2008-05-21 21:15:00;two minutes;Bright, silent light moving across the sky I took my dog out at about 9:15 PST.  And happened to look up in the sky, almost directly above me a brilliant, bright, white light was moving across the sky from S.W to N.E.  Moving at a constant speed and direction.  I'd estimate at an elevation of 30 to 35 thousand feet.  And I'd estimate the speed to be around 200-300 MPH.  An airplane had past North of the object heading West.  I could hear the engines fading away as I noticed the light moving basically in the opposite direction.  I kept my attention on the light, noting there was absolutely no sound coming from the object. This was definitely not a shooting star, there was no trail what-so-ever, and moving much too slow.  And I'd rule out a satellite, this was closer, more like commercial airlines fly.  The night was clear directly over Mammoth Lakes tonight. The moon has already set, or hasn't risen yet.  I lost sight of the light approximately two minutes after noticing it, disappearing behind distant clouds N.E. of town.;37.6094;-118.8656
Ball of light that was able to turn on and off as well as move at speeds that seemed regardless of inertia.;2012-11-15 02:00:00;2 seconds;Ball of light that was able to turn on and off as well as move at speeds that seemed regardless of inertia. I was looking up at a bright star in the sky at 2 am in mammoth lakes, CA, when a white light flashed on and became brighter than the star and the nearby planet (brightest light in the sky at the time) and sped off to another point in the sky and then disappeared.  It must have traveled thousands of miles an hour. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.6094;-118.8656
Color shifting light moving in strange ways and making no sound.;2014-05-22 21:30:00;1 minute;color shifting light moving in strange ways and making no sound. The object appeared to be very small and very close.  The weather was cold, about 35 degrees Fahrenheit, and partially cloudy with thunderless lightning.   Within 500 feet was a small red light making no sound, we originally thought was a firework rocket.  Until it stopped moving and stayed perfectly still for a few seconds.   It began shifting color and moving left and right at perfect right angles.  It turned red again and lowered toward the ground.  We could clearly see the trees it was in front of and the trees it was behind.   It lowered to the ground and we didnt see it the rest of the night.  It was over a creek behind some buildings.   The witnesses are 3 100% sober teenagers and one woman walking her dog.   We plan to take a look at the place we saw the light in the daytime.
