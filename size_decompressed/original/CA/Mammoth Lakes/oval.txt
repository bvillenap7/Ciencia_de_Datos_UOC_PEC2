Large & shiny tic tac hovers and then flies off.;2019-01-05 12:00:00;8 minutes;Large & shiny tic tac hovers and then flies off. While on a ski trip to Mammoth, we witnessed what we first thought was a drone hovering above us.  We couldn’t get a handle on its size or distance for several minutes as it didn’t make any sense to what we knew was possible.  It was shaped like a very shiny Tic Tac, perhaps 10 feet long.  It was hovering then would drop and ascend very rapidly.  My 14 year old step daughter became quite afraid, while I assured her it had to be some sort of drone, but I don’t think any of us was buying my story.  We watched it for the duration of the chair lift, the group behind us seeing it as well.  After about 8 minutes it flew off into the interior of Yosemite.
