My husband and I looked out the window in our front door and notice an immensely bright light. It was about 4 times brighter and about twice the size of what Venus is viewed as from the same viewing location. We watched as the light (indiscernible shape due to brightness of light) moved along and through the treetops seemingly not far from our home location. It swooped back and forth as if scanning, or looking around. It seemed as if the light was mostly on one side because as it swooped it the light would seem to face away and then back towards us. But not like a helicopter, it seemed as if the whole face of the thing was light.  As the sun came up I noticed a couple other small crafts seemingly interacting with the larger one. They were the size of what we observe as satellites on other nights, but one seemed to be orbiting the large light and the other went off to the right of the light and came back to it within minutes. The craft moved in a climbing pattern to the right over about a 15 minute time period and then we watched it get smaller and smaller as we could tell it was leaving but it was leaving directly away from us, we lost visual as the huge bright light (still immensely bright even with the sun rising) became a speck in the upper outer atmosphere..  The other odd thing about this sighting (not sure if it is related but I feel worth noting) was that the whole time there was a glowing orange light off to the left that we thought might have been a neighbors light (even though it DID seem closer than the nearest neighbor..) but we haven't seen it since that morning.;38.2280066666667;-120.541086666667
