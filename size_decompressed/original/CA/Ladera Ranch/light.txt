A large disk formed clump of lights colored with gold and white, super bright, flew by my two windows just below the clouds but right over a tall tree.  I immediately jumped up yelling what did I just see them quickly went onto Snapchat to get a date and time and description of what I just saw.  after it flew by my dog started shaking. it was not an airplane or a drone and it was silent but close.  I donâ€™t know what I saw that night but for sure was a ufo.;33.5472;-117.6238
