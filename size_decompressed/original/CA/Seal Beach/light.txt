Drifting Red Light escorted by 3 helicopters over Orange County;2009-01-28 17:45:00;7-8 Minutes;Drifting Red Light escorted by 3 helicopters over Orange County From my friend’s house in Garden Grove on Wednesday Jan 28th at 17:45 hours, we noticed a red light drifting over the Seal Beach area crossing from the Los Angeles/Orange County border towards Huntington Beach,    The light was escorted by 3 helicopters, one on each side and one high overhead.  We observed all 4 airships for about 7-8 minutes as the traveled SE over the coast until we lost sight behind the trees;33.7615;-118.0763

Yesterday, at around 2PM, in Seal Beach, CA, I saw what I believe to be UFOs.  I was standing on the side of Pacific Coast Highway, facing north. It was a very clear day. I tilted my head back while I was stretching (otherwise I wouldn’t have noticed), and saw white lights, or dots (mostly round in shape) in the sky.  They were very high in the air, too high up to be birds. They made no noise. The lights, or dots, seemed to disappear and reappear as I watched.  I would look away, and then look back, and they were still there. I watched for a period of 3-5 minutes. I saw as many as 18 of the objects, and as few as 3.  They would literally disappear and reappear as I watched.  At one point, I could see only three, and they were in a triangle formation.  Then suddenly the rest reappeared. The objects also seemed to multiply. I would be staring at one, and it appeared to split into two. The grouping seemed random, but very close together.  Almost like pockets of white dots. They were not straight up in the air, but almost straight up. If “straight up” means 90 degrees, then I would say they were at about 70 degrees. They moved, but not like airplanes.  They just seemed to hover, yet they did move slowly across the sky. A friend was with me and says the same thing I am reporting.  We are sane individuals, who were completely sober.  Also, we are not the types to report such a thing. I just do not understand what we saw.;33.7615;-118.0763
