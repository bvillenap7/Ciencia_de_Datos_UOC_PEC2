Ball of fire falling from sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Orionid meteor??  PD));2015-10-23 22:30:00;10 seconds;Ball of fire falling from sky I was talking with friends and I noticed a new light in my peripheral vision.  I looked up and saw what seemed to be a falling star just above eye level.  Then I realized it was far too large and close to be a shooting star because it seemed to only be a mile away.  It looked a ball of fire falling from the sky with a trail of smoke.  It feel almost perpendicular to the ground.  It took about 5-10 seconds to fall from where I first saw it to beyond the building skyline and out of my sight.;33.7615;-118.0763

It also looked like a couple of the fireballs had fire emanating from them, and they did not make sound.;33.7615;-118.0763
