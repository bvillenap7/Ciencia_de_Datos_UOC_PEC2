Two green blue flashes on the ground in Seal Beach near base.;2017-03-31 02:26:00;5 seconds;Two green blue flashes on the ground in Seal Beach near base. Driving down a main road in Westminster, my friend and I saw two flashes on the ground by the base in Seal Beach.  It was bright green on the outside, like the green of a stoplight.  And, blue in the center, blue like the hottest area of a fire.   It flashed once for a couple seconds, followed by a second of rest.  Then, it started again and seemed a little brighter than last one, and lasted a couple seconds, as well.   It was bright enough to illuminate the sky like a Disneyland firework set off that failed to reach the sky.;33.7615;-118.0763
