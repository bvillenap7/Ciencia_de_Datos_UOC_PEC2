Two white flashes light up Northern California sky;2002-08-05 22:00:00;1 sec. each;Two white flashes light up Northern California sky Driving home at night south on Hwy. 101 in Northern California in the Petaluma vicinity, I saw a white flash of light from an unknown source behind the hills that lit up the horizon in front of me. At first I surmised that maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me from the long drive I'd been doing from Reggae On The River, or maybe it was a reflection of oncoming cars' headlights, but then, about twenty minutes later when I was coming down the Waldo Grade toward the Golden Gate Bridge - it happened once again! The whole southern horizon beyond the city of San Francisco down below me lit up for a split second! Weather conditions were completely clear with no clouds, so I'm sure it couldn't have been lightning that caused it. I was astonished when the flash happened again the second time, thinking I might have been mistaken in what I'd seen at first some minutes and distance before. I could not see any craft or airplane in the sky either time, and I heard no noise as my windows were rolled up and the events must have been quite a distance away.

2 Flashes of light in the Petaluma Country;2005-05-11 11:30:00;1 Second;2 Flashes of light in the Petaluma Country Driving home on the Petaluma-Nicasio Road, I witnessed a flash that lit up the horizon (behind mountains) in front of me.  I clearly saw the outline of the Mtn. Range.  The road continues up to the top of that Mtn. (Overlooking an olive orchard)  I pulled over and waited outside my car with the flashers on so I wouldn't get hit.  A car that was a few miles behind me, (or at least 5 minutes) pulled up and asked if I had seen the flash.  I told them I had.  After a short while I got back in my car to continue my drive.  (It was really cold out)  After no more than 30 seconds in the car, I saw the next Mtn. range in front of me light up as I had the last.  It was a strange experiance to say the least.  I can't think of any light I have seen so bright.  We are talking 10 miles of Mtn. profile that lit up.  I don't think a transformer blowing up could do that.  However, I'm not sure I rule out the possibility of a metiorite quite yet.  Something to note:  I did see more animals on this road than I typically do.  There were aircraft in the area, however, I am unsure as to weather they were civilian or military.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
