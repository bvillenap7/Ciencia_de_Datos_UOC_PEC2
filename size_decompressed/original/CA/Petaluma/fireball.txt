Two sightings in Petaluma;2012-10-03 21:30:00;2 minutes;two sightings in Petaluma On 10-3-12 around 2130hrs my fiancée witnessed about 7 solid white UFOs at a low altitude in west Petaluma.   The objects were low (about 100feet) and appeared to be hovering just above the large hill up from English street.  She saw them from a distance of about a mile (from city hall) and watched them for about two minutes from inside a vehicle before going inside.  She reported there was a group of three that formed a perfect triangle.  This triangle was hovering just above the largest oak tree at the top of hill.  It appeared to her that the light from the craft was illuminating the tree line at the top of the hill.  She also stated there were about four other craft the same while color but not as bright in the same area but perhaps a little further away.  Most of her attention was on the three large in the triangle formation.  I called the local police and they did not have any reports for this incident.  I pretty sure other people must have seen it, ! as there are houses very close to the sighting.  About a week prior my buddy’s wife saw a UFO near the power sub-station on Stony Point road in the daylight.  This sighting was followed by two helicopters and a jet apparently pursuing the craft.  She described one helicopter as black and the other as camouflage.  She did not give a description of the jet.  The UFO appeared to resemble a meteorite from the cell phone picture she took (sorry I cannot up load the photo).  This object was seen near Meacham Rd and stony point.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
