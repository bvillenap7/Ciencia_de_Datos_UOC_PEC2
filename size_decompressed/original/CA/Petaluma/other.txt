UFO on Stony Point;2012-09-29 11:00:00;5 minutes;UFO on Stony Point Driving on Stony Point Rd. From Santa Rosa to Petaluma.   I pulled over by the dump site and took a picture.  I've seen it few times but this one is clear that it is UFO.  Falling down fast but when it got closer to land it slowed down.  Then after few hours few jets flying around the area.  I think they were trying to cover up but it was obviously different.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
Comet like sighting over 101 petaluma area.;2013-03-20 00:00:00;4 minutes;comet like sighting over 101 petaluma area On 3-20-13 at 1316hrs while driving south-bound on HWY 101 coming down the Cotati grade I noticed what appeared to be a white comet with two tails (about 80 meters long) high in the sky.  The object appeared to be about 4 to seven miles away and about 15,000 feet up.  It appeared to be traveling slowly heading south, as the tail was behind the object.  After a minute or two the object stated to lose altitude and seemed to face my general direction.  The tail was no longer visible during this time and only the white round cloud color could be seen.   As I exited the first Petaluma off-ramp the object appeared low about 500 to 700 feet and at a distance of about 1 mile.  The white color I had seen was gone, and for a brief moment I saw a round solid object and then I lost it behind the trees.  I kept looking in the area but could not see it again. the tail on the object would disappear after about 80 yards.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
Brilliant stationary multi color lights for nearly one hour over Petaluma, CA.;2014-06-25 02:45:00;~45 minutes;Brilliant stationary multi color lights for nearly one hour over Petaluma, CA. Looking out my second story bedroom sliding glass door, in the north west sky, I saw what I first thought was a very brilliant multicolored star.  I put on my glasses and knew it wasn’t a star.  Red, blue, green, white lights were glittering in an indeterminate pattern on a stationary object.  Occasionally, the lights were a crystal white bright, but always changing and moving.  The object did not move up and down at all, nor did it appear to move toward or away from me.   I grabbed binoculars and that improved my view a bit, but the object seemed to be quite far away.  I awakened my spouse who confirmed he saw the same thing.  After about 20 minutes the oject tilted to the right, maybe a 20-30 degree angle, then stayed in that position for the duration of my ability to view it.   The lights continued to glitter, change color and move mostly from the left to the right of the object, but sometimes the colored lights moved more up and down.   Nearing 0330, the fog began to roll in and the object seemed to sink very slowly, over about a 5–10 minute time frame, until I was no longer able to see it at all.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
