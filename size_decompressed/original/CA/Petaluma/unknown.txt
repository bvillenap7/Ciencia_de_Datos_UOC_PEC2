U;2007-06-25 22:15:00;7to10 seconds;As we were driving south on hwy. 101 through petaluma, all 3 of us in our vehicle noticed a bright light traveling towards the earth. Unlike any other falling star I have seen before, this light kept traveling like a crashing craft of sometype. I am curious if you might know what this could have been.
