Silver Conical Craft with Exceptionally Bright Light over Petaluma, CA.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:01:00;10-15 minutes;Silver Conical Craft with Exceptionally Bright Light over Petaluma California At 6:00pm on Saturday November 07, 2015, I was driving on S. McDowell Blvd, entering the Baywood Dr Rotary. On my right, roughly 500 feet in the air, I saw a large matte silver cone, about 60 feet in height. The tip was pointed upward at a 25 degree angle and the craft was rising at about 40mph. From the bottom of the cone, a bright xenon-ish white light, roughly 10,000,000 candle watt, expended in a sharply defined line, that broadened into a conical shape, 300 feet behind it. The craft entered low hung clouds, which illuminated the clouds but the sharply illuminated line remained, suspended in the air, much like an airline chemtrail. The illuminated line, remained for over 3 minutes, slowly dimming, until it was barely visible. I counted at least 7 vehicles passing by me on Baywood Dr but none had stopped to watch. One briefly entered the on-coming traffic lane, which I assume, was from watching the event. I took out my cell phone to shoot a video but I did not record anything viable. I am familiar with all types of aircraft, military & civilian, this was neither. Usually when an illumination source is extinguished, so is the light it projects. This illuminated line remained after the craft & it's conical light were no longer visible.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
