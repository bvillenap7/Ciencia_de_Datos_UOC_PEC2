Bright white disk, traveling rapidly in a straight line from Northwest to North toward the horizon.;1998-12-15 03:30:00;1 second;Bright white disk, traveling rapidly in a straight line from Northwest to North toward the horizon. The object appeared and immediately grew very bright (as bright as the brightest star in the sky) and about two and a half times as large as the biggest star seen in the sky. As soon as it had reached its maximum brightness, it moved in a straight line from the northwest, where it first appeared, to the north. Within about half to three quarters of a second it had gone behind a tree so I could no longer keep track of it. It was much too fast for an aeroplane or satellite, and considerably slower than a meteorite. I couldn't really tell its altitude. Its elevation started at about 40 degrees above the horizon and was at about 35 degrees when I lost sight of it.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
White/Orange sphere races across San Francisco area sky.;2013-09-07 21:30:00;5-7 seconds;White/Orange sphere races across San Francisco area sky. While sitting enjoying the evening on our backyard deck, a friend of ours jumps up and says WHAT'S THAT?  Our friend was looking toward the southern horizon.   I quickly jumped up to see.  The object by this time was midway across the sky.  (about 2 second period).  At first I couldn't see what my friend was seeing because my house momentarily blocked my vision.   However, within a half a second, I saw a white/orange circular object racing across the sky.  Inside of three seconds, it had faded into the northern horizon.  The total time it took the object to cross from the southern to northern horizon was about 5 to 6 seconds.  I have NEVER seen anything move that fast in my life!  It did not seem to have a tail from my vantage point.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
Orange/white circle travels at alarming speed over San Francisco area.;2013-09-07 23:15:00;7-10 seconds;Orange/white circle travels at alarming speed over San Francisco area. The object was a small round shape that could be mistaken for a satellite had it not been for it's speed.  It's color was an orange and white combination.  It traveled from south to north in about 7-10 seconds, much faster than any satellite can travel.  There is nothing that travels as fast as what we saw!;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384

The lights at first were one above the other, and then they gradually moved around, sometimes circling each other, sometimes parallel, appearing to come closer to me, until one of them faded out.   The other one then got farther and farther away until it was lost in the clouds.   They moved slowly, and there was no sound associated with this at all.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
Dull orange orb over Petaluma, CA, for over five minutes 2/6/2016, a portion of which was a very bright, fiery orange.;2016-02-06 18:40:00;5 minutes;Dull orange orb over Petaluma, CA, for over five minutes 2/6/2016, a portion of which was a very bright, fiery orange. While sitting on my sofa watching the Golden State Warriors game against the Thunder, saw a dull orange circular object appear through the window in the southeast.  Walked outside to see what it was and this orange orb was slowly moving in a generally southeasterly direction.  It had a brighter portion which was about 10% of the total size of the object and that part was slowly rotating in an irregular pattern around and through the object.  Grabbed my binoculars out of the car and was able to see clearly that that brighter orange glow rotating continued and in trying to identify it the only thing that it was remotely like was a large balloon with a gondola slung underneath it.  In this case though, the gondola was on fire as it was significantly brighter than the rest of the object.  But the way this brighter portion was moving was not predictable and did not have an obvious pattern or rhythm to it.  The dimmer portion of the orb looked to have a semblance of a grid-like appearance, but when the brighter portion of the glow moved across the face of it, the grid was no longer visible due to the greater intensity of the light. After about four minutes of relatively slow and consistently paced movement from my right to left, it appeared to turn south and head toward San Francisco roughly.  It moved away at a regular pace for several seconds and then appeared to speed up significantly until it became too small to view and then disappeared.  The speed of this last part seemed unlike anything that I've seen before, as though the physics I am aware of were no longer operating on this object.  The disappearance from view in the last ten seconds essentially happened too fast to be explained by any previous experience I've had.  There was no sound involved at all. This is the first time that I have ever seen, much less reported, anything like this.  Until I did a Google search on 'orange object in the night sky over Petaluma tonight,' I was unaware of websites like this.  I'm a totally sane person and this was in no way imagined.  I'm a professional IT Project Manager and have been in the industry for many years with increasing levels of responsibility.  Folks like me are pretty grounded as a rule or would not be able to survive in these kinds of roles for long.  Keeping calm under great pressure is a prerequisite for this work. I've got no idea who reads these entries or what is done with them, but felt that if there is something weird around and others have seen the same thing, maybe it is a good idea to report.

UFO over Petaluma on August 28, 2016, @ approximately 7:30 pm..;2016-08-28 19:30:00;~1 hour;UFO over Petaluma on August 28, 2016, @ approximately 7:30 pm. My nine-years-old son was in the backyard and noticed a light in the sky, mentioning that it was too early for the stars and it this one didn’t even look like one.   I came out and saw a bright object, obviously not a star, staying in one spot with the sun clearly reflecting off it.  Got binoculars and couldn’t believe my eyes.  It looked like a semi-transparent sphere with five white lights under it.   Gave my son the binoculars and asked him what he sees. His words were:  “No way, no way.”  He also saw the lights underneath it.  Called my husband to come out and look.  By then the object wasn’t transparent but was an oval shape and reflecting the sun like metal.    The object was there for approximately an hour, and then began slowly drifting east until it disappeared.   I took a (very bad) picture with my phone but was only be able to capture a faint light spot in the sky.  But the picture has a date and time stamp.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
