The one in the northeast appeared very bright with 4 lights and multicolored carnival lights outlining the entire craft and hovered for a very long time and then just begam to fly towards the other light in the southwest.  The other lights appeared like cat eyes, a color blue that I cannot describe, but were much like a dusty sky blue and not bright in any way.  This craft was just staying in one spot and remained there.  The other craft just vanished.  The skies that night were starless, and no wind, and very cold.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
