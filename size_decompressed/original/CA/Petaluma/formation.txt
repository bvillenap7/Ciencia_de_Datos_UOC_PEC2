Large object seen hovering over Petaluma, California neighborhood.;2000-11-02 20:30:00;2 MINUTES;Large object seen hovering over Petaluma, California neighborhood. The object was the size of 3 baseball diamonds put together.  It appeared to be about 30 stories in height from the ground.  It glided across the sky with a whooshing noise.  It had pulsating red lights that moved from left to right and then right to left.  It was heading north west. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length to the youth who submitted this report.  He, his friend, and his friend's mother were witness to the object.  It generated a sound, and the red lights were in an arc, concave downward.  PD));38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
6 small disks grouped together, changing formation, variable brightness, visible for 15 minutes, no clouds.;2004-09-22 13:15:00;15 mins;6 small disks grouped together, changing formation, variable brightness, visible for 15 minutes, no clouds. I was walking through a suburban neighborhood when I noticed 6 bright white objects flying closely together high in the sky (about 50-60 deg elevation).  My initial impression was that they were birds.  There is a local species of white crane, but I have never seen them flock like this.  Moreover, these objects appeared to be much higher than the altitudes at which local birds fly.  They were disk like and traversed the sky from SE to NW.  At one point they circled.  They changed formation, appearing as a straight line, a large v, an s curve, 2 v shapes, and random grouping but still close together.  They stayed together for the entire time I observed them (if they had been balloons, I would have expected one or more of them to drift away from the others).  Their reflectivity/brightness varied as they moved across the sky, appearing very bright at one point, then almost disappearing before brightening back up.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384

Some time ones by before 4 circle-like figures, in a rectangle shape adjacent from one another, are birthed and travel around and beyond the orb like light which is also simultaneously growing to be bigger and bigger. Another set of 4 circle-like ufo figures are suddenly birthed and summoned to follow the previous set of 4 rectangle like formation to near exact motion of direction of the ones prior. In the mean time the orb within the sky has grown dramatically and is clearly vivid and non moving of its location until suddenly is vanished. This is a very rare phenomen here meaning that even if there has been ufo sightings here in a minuscule manner that this is out of the ordinary.  There have been multiple witnesses known via social media outlets that have witnessed and Recorded this phenomenon in multiple different angles within this given location.;38.2480280000001;-122.6506384
