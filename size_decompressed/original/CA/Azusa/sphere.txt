UFO sighting in azusa, ca, usa in daylight silver orb 200-300 feet above ground. 2 Witness'.;2004-04-01 17:00:00;20 seconds;UFO sighting in azusa, ca, usa in daylight silver orb 200-300 feet above ground. 2 Witness'. It was after work, I usually would work from 1pm to 10pm at that time but I was doing a training and was out by 430-530pm. My friend came to pick me up from work because she was coming out to orange county to stay with me for a while so we left her car at my work parking lot, we got into my car and preceded to head south bound on azusa ave in the covina/azusa area. We were driving in the left lane on azusa heading toward the 10 freeway maybe about 1-2 miles from the freeway. I looked up and saw a silver, perfect orb in the sky. I could tell it was metallic and not plastic such as a balloon because of the reflection of the sun on its right side. The orb or sphere did not move and i cannot tell if it was spinning because it was pretty much a perfect looking circle in my vision. I look down at the road and my spedometer, I looked up at the spehre again, i would say it must have been between 200-300 feet above the surface and maybe 10-15 feet in diameter. I asked my friend if she saw the spehere i was looking at and she kind of non caringly said yeah i see it. She acknowledged it being there so I knew my eyes were not playing tricks on me. I continued down azusa ave and moved into the left lane as i approached the freeway, I pass by a couple of trees on the sidewalk and as i past 1 tree I saw the object inbetween the gap before the second tree. After I passed the second tree it disapeared. I have not thought much about it since, and have had no other UFO experiences. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.
