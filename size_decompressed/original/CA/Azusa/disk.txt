Silver Reflecting Disk shape object over Azusa.CA;2008-01-17 14:35:00;15 minutes;Silver Reflecting Disk shape object over Azusa.CA At 14:35 at my work, I was doing a foot patrol and something caught my attention in the sky.  From north east from the San Gabriel Mountains, there was an object that looked like a plane but I look further and it was like chrome and had no wings or tail wing.  It was shining light from the sun or its own it appeared.  It came from north east headed south then west slowly. After observing it for 5 minutes it appeared to be a disk to long disk shape and I got a feeling whatever it was it was observing me.  I ran to my car to get my binoculars. Then it took off north west.  About 2000 feet or so I guess it would be the altitude of the object. The mountians tops at the mountain it came from is about 4000 feet.  The direction was from NE over the mountains slowly sweeping down heading West then up again over the mountains heading NW then speeding fast.  It was gone after it went NW.  The flight patterns here I know from years of watching and that object took a different one.  May be a military flight pattern but disk shape?  It did not make noise.  Even planes at 2000 feet make some noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));34.1230279116463;-117.898913453816
((HOAX??))  We saw a low space craft hovering above our complex.  ((anonymous report));2018-09-25 20:10:00;10 seconds;We saw a low space craft hovering above our complex.  It was moving west to east.  It moved behind a tree, so we ran around it to see better, and it looked like it landed behind some houses to the east.   We searched for it, but we couldn't find it.
