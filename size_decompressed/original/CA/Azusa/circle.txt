Small yellow circular craft, very still, then disappeared very quickly.;2013-11-28 18:05:00;3 seconds;Small yellow circular craft, very still, then disappeared very quickly. We were driving on route 210 east bound in Southern California through Azusa.    My 15 year old grandson spotted an object in the northern sky.  The object was a yellowish dot and then, it suddenly moved very fast and disappeared.  It kind of freaked him out.
