Triangular Shaped Formation Flying in an unexplainable pattern.;2003-01-29 18:30:00;5 to 10 minutes;Triangular Shaped Formation Flying in an unexplainable pattern. It was about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday evening while leaving my friends home, we both noticed different colored light formations.  Unclear what these lights were my friend said, What is that? It was certainly flying to fast to be an airplane and no sound was heard. As it got closer to us we both said, it looks triangular or V-shaped. Flying in a west/north direction then in a north direction.  Finally, in an north/east direction when the lights suddenly disappeared. Within seconds my friend noticed the lights at the original point of sighting and heading in a east/south direction, seconds pasted and again disappeared.  I drove off in my car, entered the freeway in a west direction.  Suddenly, when I looked up in the sky there was the triangular shaped formation hovering motionless.  I called my friend on my cell phone and she too confirmed what I was looking at.  Finally, the object flew again in a east/south direction and lost sight of it.;34.1230279116463;-117.898913453816
