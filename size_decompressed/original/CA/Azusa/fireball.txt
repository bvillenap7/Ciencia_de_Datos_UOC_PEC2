Azusa Mountains is a Highway for UFOS.;2007-08-12 03:00:00;6 hours;Azusa Mountains is a Highway for UFOS. It was the Perseid Meteor shower that got us to visit the mountains of Azusa, California. I remember being six of us including me who where exited to witness this event.  This was not the first time we have gone to the mountains so we know what we encounter.  It was about 2:00am and we laid on the car hood staring in the sky when we witness a fireball high in the sky it was not fast, there was no sound in the sky.  So i got out my camera and film this fireball(which nothing can be seen because of the lighting of the lcd screen blurred everything out.  Yes there was meteors and i know we can tell the difference.  As the night move on we kept spotting these far away objects high into the skies. We where amazed of how many there was.  I was scared because we where the only ones in the mountain at the time.  What we saw on August 12, 2007 startled me.  No one lives in these mountains from what i heard, but is this the reason there is so much activity here?  You guys must witness this yourself and visit the mountains one day and you'll be suprised on what you'll see.;34.1230279116463;-117.898913453816
