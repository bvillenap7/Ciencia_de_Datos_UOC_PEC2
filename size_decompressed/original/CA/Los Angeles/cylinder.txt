Cylindrical-shaped object emitting flashing lights near South Fairfax Avenue.;2016-09-11 14:00:00;5 minutes;Cylindrical-shaped object emitting flashing lights near South Fairfax Avenue. While on vacation in Los Angeles, I was in the front passenger seat as we were driving in the area of South Fairfax Avenue and Venice Boulevard, heading toward Cadillac Avenue, around 2:00 PM on September 11, 2016, when I spotted a cylindrical-shaped object emitting two gold-colored flashing lights in a vertical configuration.  The lights flashed intermittently and independently, and the object itself seemed to be just hanging in the clear blue sky about 45 degrees above the horizon.   I managed to take a few pictures with my Canon PowerShot SX20 IS camera, and then lost sight of it as we turned a corner.  I am not sure what direction the object was in. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Thank you for your message, and I did submit a detailed report to NUFORC yesterday. If you're unable to find it, I can resubmit it. To summarize, I spotted this while riding as a passenger in a car with two other witnesses, and the sighting lasted about 5 minutes.  I think we were on or near Venice Boulevard when I saw it, then I lost sight of it as we turned a corner.  It was about 45 degrees above the horizon, and there was no sound.  Two gold-colored flashing lights emitted from it intermittently and independently from each other.  One light was near the top of the object, and the other light was near its bottom. It if weren't for these lights I would probably not have noticed it.  The object was stationary. Regards, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
