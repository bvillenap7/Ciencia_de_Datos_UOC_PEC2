I sighted a disc shaped object hovering above the trees in a residential area of southwest Los Angeles in early 1970;1970-02-10 20:30:00;app. 10 min;I sighted a disc shaped object hovering above the trees in a residential area of southwest Los Angeles in early 1970 My sighting took place in the Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw area of Los Angeles in February of 1970.  While traveling north on LaBrea Avenue, coming down the hill toward Coliseum Ave, I saw very bright lights, resembling lights in a stadium, but they appeared to be too high up to be from a stadium (there was no stadium in that area.) These lights seemed odd so the driver of the car decided to investigate.  We went in their direction into a residential area that was on the north west side of Rodeo Rd and LaBrea Avenue. I'm not possitive of the exact location because I was new to Los Angeles at that time and didn't know the area well.  I did, however, know LaBrea and Rodeo Rd intersection. When we approached the area that seemed to be the source of the lights we traveled down a residential street that had a T intersection.  As we approached this intersection, and turned right, our car headlights turned toward a very large object hovering above the tree tops and electric wire poles. As our lights turned toward this object, it flashed two lights back at us as if signaling back in response to our headlights shining toward it.  This object was at the corner of this intersection and was large enough to cover the full width of the street as well as part of the house nearest that corner.  We immediately drove under it, which enabled me to see the bottom. The bottom was a light color that appeared to be either sand color or a light beige and it had the appearance of a wheel with a hub and spokes radiating from it, so my assumption is that it was disc shaped.  These spokes appeared to be dimensional rather than painted and at the center was a light that was red when we passed under.  I couldn't determine the actual shape of the top because it was very dark outside, and I couldn't see the outline due to the bright lights that flashed back at us. I assumed that the lights were on the front of the vehicle but cannot say if there were other lights. This object made absolutely no sound and was completely motionless when we encountered it. We drove under it, pulled over to the side of the street just beyond it, at which time the driver of the car became hysterical because she recoginzed it to be a UFO. I wanted to get out to have a better look but the passenger side of the door was jammed due to a previous accident and wouldn't open. I could not get the driver to move to let me out. By the time she pulled herself together, started the car engine and made a U-turn to head back in the direction of the UFO, it was gone.  It made no sound when it moved off.  I don't know whether it moved sideways or straight up but it must have taken off at a fast speed because the whole episode seemed to be very brief.  When we reached the corner where it had been hovering, I tried to look in the sky and spot it.  I did see lights in the far distance, west of our location, and at the time I assumed these lights could have been the object.  In retrospect I cannot say for certain.  It may have moved sidways, up or it may have vanished.  I don't know. About a week or two after this event, while returning home from evening school in downtown Los Angeles, I was a passenger riding on the Santa Monica Freeway, heading west of downtown.  Needless to say, I was watching the skys trying to see this object again.  I did see a bright stationary light in the sky, to the left of the freeway in the area of Normandie or Western Avenue and south of the freeway.  As I looked at it, wondering if this was the same UFO, the light winked out.  It was like someone turning off a light and then there was nothing. The day after my initial sighting, the driver of the car and I called several places, including Goodyear just to confirm it was not a blimp we had seen, although we knew it wasn't. Also, it was not a helicopter, as you can hear them a mile away. Goodyear confirmed that no blimps had been in the air at all because of the wind conditions. The car driver called an office of the Air Force and was told they knew nothing.  Upon making further calls she was told this was a vehicle being tested by Hughes Aircraft, and that the neighborhood had been notified. This was 1970 and to my knowledge we had no vehicles that were shaped like this or that could perform in this manner.  To date, we still don't unless they are really more secret than some of the black projects.  I got a pretty good look at the bottom side of this UFO as we drove under and there were no wings or apendages that I could see and it was totally silent and motionless until it moved away from the area.

Northbound saucer-shaped objects zigzag across Southern California;1970-09-01 14:00:00;2 minutes;Northbound saucer-shaped objects zigzag across Southern California As I sat on the front porch at my parentâ€™s house, which faces north, I happened to look east toward the LA Coliseum, and something high up in the sky caught my attention. I saw a shiny, saucer-shaped object sitting in the sky. Then, a few seconds later, two more of these objects came cruising slowly to where the first one was apparently waiting because a few seconds later, the first one suddenly shot away northward in a zigzagging motion that took two or three really quick direction changes. Then it would come to a dead, sudden stop, and just sit there while the two following came slowly over to where it was, but in a straight line. I watched them do this about 4 times, moving north across Southern California, toward and past Pasadena. I watched approximately 2 minutes.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
I could see vehicles driving eastbound on the 134 freeway & the UFOs passing over the top of them.;1977-03-17 18:00:00;5-10 min;March 1977- I was in the front yard watering the lawn. It was late evening, 6-7pm. The sun had gone down, but it was not dark.  What I saw next was awesome.  As I looked east,were what appeared to be 2 UFOs, one was quite large the other about 1/2 size or so. They were moving very slowly, spinning slowly toward the north.  There was NO sound. I dropped the hose and ran inside the house yelling for mom & dad to come out quickly.  My older brother(20yrs) also ran outside.  Much to everyone amazement, the UFOs were still there.  What I can best describe the sight is the shape was like a spinning top only compressed top to bottom with lighted windows around the center horizontally, and blinking lights on top& bottom.  Like I said NO NOISE  The size was larger than 3-two story houses and they were about 300-500 feet up in the sky.  I could see vehicles driving eastbound on the 134 freeway & the UFOs passing over the top of them.  I have always wondered why no one else reported it.  WHAT DID WE SEE????  Many years have gone by, but my family and I still can picture what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

A light would go around the saucer and when it hit the center it would flash and change color on the band not ship. So we all went outside to see it it made no noise . Well as kids we were excited and trying to see if it was a toy or projector type camera. It didn't sink in as a true UFO til it went straight up into the sky until my father's binoculars could not see it anymore. I never forgot it. I always wanted to get hypnotized to see if I forgot any details. Fast forward in 2000s My son's pointed out these UFOs witnessed by three adults including myself and my two boys they looked like entities red with center glowing , they looked like sting rays and moved like it. Went over head I had one hover me as I took photos with a disposable when I got the piks back the fotos of the UFO was not develop it wasn't dark blanks like usuals one fotos are not clear the will develop them anyways and not charge you for it .

UFO's are attracted to me.;1994-06-23 21:00:00;20-30 sec;UFO's are attracted to me. I was going out to my car from a relativeâ€™s house when I got half way down the driveway in the roundabout housing development a flying saucer stormed over the cul de sac halfway quietly with half the sound of a commercial airplane the the size of half the cul de sac.  At first it blinded me and the neighbor taking her toddler out of the car seat then it switched to three white lights under a skinny cow looking saucer with long blue lights on the sides.  It hovered over the cul de sac within two jumping distances of me at the time and looked as if it was checking us out.  After a 10-20 second checking me out it made a right flank about 1/10th of a mile into the sky and then went into hyperspace to the right.  If you want the feeling think about the talefane from Dr. Who with a twist being a flying saucer that was black and had to of come from some secret military base as I have never seen any aircraft like it.  I was not the only one who saw it either.  The neighb! or saw it with her son and her toddler and it was later found out that half the city called the sheriff as it was put on the news even though they saw it during the day and I saw it at night.  I filed a report with the Sheriffâ€™s office but they swear that it was a helicopter or a plane on a training mission despite all the accounts of damages from the UFO and the military base not having any planes or radio surveillance.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
12-25-97 a disk shaped U.F.O. - top half silver, bottom black - hovered over Eagle Rock from 9am to 11am.;1997-12-25 09:00:00;2 hours;12-25-97 a disk shaped U.F.O. - top half silver, bottom black - hovered over Eagle Rock from 9am to 11am. The sighting began Christmas morning, December 25, 1997, at 9am.  Every one of my neighbors â€“ approximately 200 people â€“  stood out on the street looking skyward as the disk shaped craft hovered vertically south of my house.  The disk had a intense mirrorlike reflective top half and dense black appearance on the bottom half.  The unidentified craft hovered motionless here for two hours in broad daylight.  I got a excellent look at the disk with 9x binoculars.  Every now and then, a brilliant ruby red light would shoot down to the earth from the craft as if it was aimed a few blocks from me.  During the two hour period, not one car drove past my location, either on Eagle Rock Blvd. or any side street. At one point, I could see a small window open in the side of the craft.  The image was distant, but I could see something move inside the disk before the window seamlessly closed.  The craft hovered here until 11am and then began to slowly drift south.  After a few minutes the unidentified disk tilted on its axis, at a forty-five degree angle, and then disappeared into a point of light. The disk was seen at least ten blocks in every direction which means over 2000 people saw this strange unidentified object.

Its quick movements would happen often.  I remembered about my binoculars and looked through to see what shape it was. It was a shinny light that appeared to be rotating quickly.  I saw material around the bright light, but could not make out what it was.  At one moment an airplane passed by, and it appeared to be traveling about that fast but not quite.  At some moments it completely stopped and did nothing, then moved again. I don't know exactly how far up in the sky it was.

First, I felt a weird feeling, as I felt when I was alone at a cold night. I looked out of the car. My sister and brother were asleep. My mother was busy reading a map. My dad was driving. We were on our way to Stockton for vacation. I gazed up at the sky. It was about late at night. I saw lights high up in the sky. I said to my dad, Look up! He wouldn't believe me. I didn't even ask my mother because I knew that she wouldn't believe me either. I couldn't see the shape of the objects. When the car began to turn right, the light flashed on the objects. I saw the figure. It looked like a frisbee. Suddenly, the objects flashed beams. I was blinded for a while. AFter gaining my sense of sight, I tried to find it but couldn't. I asked my dad if he was blinded by the UFOs' beams. My dad told me that joking was bad and that if aliens really were around the earth, people would be scared not joking about it.

I personally had enough time to run one block home, grab my video camera, and return to film it. I was accompanied by my girlfriend who also saw it.  Craft could have been mistaken for a balloon by its slow, tumbling motion. However, its movement revealed it to be perfectly round and then perfectly disc-shaped. Weather was sunny and clear, the sun often reflecting off its surface when the angle was right. I cannot estimate the size. Disc was sometimes horizontal, but mostly vertical.

When I looked up, I saw the leading edge of a spacecraft which appeared to be heading west.  The craft was about 25 feet in diameter, hovering slowly. I do not recollect seeing any color but remember that the portion I did see looked darker than the rest. There was a shimmery effect over most of the craft. It looked similar to the creature in the movie Predator. Could that have been an effect of cloaking?  I remember thinking the craft was round even though I could not see all of it.

close circle of bright lights that changed into one bright light as it turned and changed into a red light as it hovered (only one);2008-04-22 01:25:00;30 min.;close circle of bright lights that changed into one bright light as it turned and changed into a red light as it hovered (only one) The object started out looking like a star, but then began growing until it was clearly visible.  It began as the size of other stars, just brighter, but then it looked like a ring of lights. 	The object was not spherical because the ring of lights would combine into one bright light, implying that it was disc-shaped.  A red light also flashed when the ring of lights became one extremely bright light.  The ring of lights and the bright light were the same color as the stars, and even brighter. 	The object hovered back and forth, growing as it approached us.  It zoomed out and in away from us, and when we walked close to the area under where it was hovering, it became larger and chased us, as the red light appeared. 	As we got closer, we could hear the buzzing noise.  It wasnâ€™t a constant buzzing, but had crescendos and diminuendos.  It then hovered, tilting dropping one side then the other, until it landed about 200 yards from where we were standing.  I took a video of it on my cell phone, but when I went back to look at it, the video wasnâ€™t there.  I also took a picture, which also was not on my cell phone when I went back to check. 	I believe it landed in the park behind Dockweiler beach down a street called Argonaut.  There is a lake in the park and it is a possibility that it landed in the lake, but it did land for sure. 	I have never seen a UFO before, and never believed in the sightings, but this was for real.  Within an hour of the sighting, I also saw 4 shooting stars.  I have never seen shooting stars before this night as well.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Glowing disk like object moving abot Los Angeles;2009-01-18 07:30:00;1 hour;Glowing disk like object moving abot Los Angeles I was looking outside my patio door, and I noticed a very bright object slowly moving over the mountains that line Los Angeles.  It was about 10 miles away, and appeared to be the size of 2-3 blimps.  The funny thing was was that there appeared to be no external lights to it, it was lit up from the inside out.  And the entire thing was glowing.  It slowly made its way around the Los Angeles basin until it was out of sight.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Two different types of objects were filmed on June 5th 2009 near Dodger Stadium 3:00 PM;2009-06-05 15:00:00;4 Seconds;Two different types of objects were filmed on June 5th 2009 near Dodger Stadium 3:00 PM On June 5th 2009 I was at Dodger Stadium filming video of fire attack helicopters land and take off from Dodger Stadium. My camera is the Canon Power shot SD790 1S 10.0 Mega Pixel. They were fighting a fire that had started in the Los Angeles Lincoln Heights area, days later I was starting to look through my footage when I was rewinding in slow motion and saw an object flash? So I went frame by frame.  An Saucer like object stopped in mid air for 1.2 frames and was gone just as quick in another shot you can see a ball shaped object come from frame left to right and what seemed to pass in front of a LA city helicopter. The only reason I'm posting this is because I see on the 8th of June 2009 in Lincoln Heights someone else saw something to!  I really don't believe in UFO's but I can't ignore what I caught on my digital camera anybody else have any ideas on what this could have been?;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
UFO found in Google Earth Street Views throughout neighborhood.;2009-06-30 00:00:00;UNKOWN;UFO found in Google Earth Street Views throughout neighborhood. While I was searching Google Earth, Street view is when I panned up to the sky, there was a perfect pink/coral colored bell shaped UFO with what seemed to be a vapor plume, or cylindrical aura under the craft (as if it was the effect of a propulsion system.)  I first thought it could be a reflection from the camera, or drivers windshield who takes the images for Google however, wherever you go in the street views nearby, the UFO is orientated correctly in the sky even if it is behind you (you can rotate street view images all angles.)  To see for yourself one can use Google Earth, type in 8200 Alverstone Av. Los Angeles, CA. 90045 and pan up to the sky and see it. Then travel all streets near by via street view and locate the image yourself.  You will find that this appears to be a UFO that is travelling very, very slowly in the northerly direction.

Curcular disk shaped craft with 3 bright lights ascends straight up into the sky over Los Angeles at an unusually slow speed.;2009-09-16 00:10:00;4 minutes;Curcular disk shaped craft with 3 bright lights ascends straight up into the sky over Los Angeles at an unusually slow speed. I was lounging on my couch in my apt when the volume on my tv went mute.  I grabbed my remote when I realized I was hearing what sounded like either a rolling thunder or and aircraft.  I live on the second floor and my window was open two away from me.  The volume on my tv returned but I was puzzled because I was unsure where the sound was coming from. I turned the volume on my tv down to mute to verify what I was hearing not from the tv. The sound continued. It had been a clear day so thunder I thought was unlikely. The sound still persist, by this time at least 2 minutes had passed since my tv volume had first been interrupted. Out of curiosity I walked over to the window and there it was. The craft was ascending into the air very very slowly. It was not very high in the air, I would say maybe the height of a police helicopter. But I know it wasn't a copter for at least two reasons 1.  There was no helicopter sound which I am very familiar with having grew up in the inner city and currently living within a mile of a police station.   2.  The lights on the craft where not at all like the typical search light you see on police helicopters. I am pretty certain that it was circular shape/disk shape. Although it did not seem thin or flat disk, it was thick or tall but it was more wide than tall by far. It seemed black or dark and it's figure was more of a shadow or outline. It had three very dark lights on it. There were two red lights on each end and on the left side just near the red light there was a blinking yellow light. I must stress that the lights were very clear and very bright! I followed the craft rising in the sky with my eyes until it went out of my line of sight through my window pane. I wanted to run down stairs an continue watching but I was in my undergarments. The sound which was jet and thunder like continued to persist. I scrabbed to my bedroom to find something to pit on, but by the time I reached the stairs the sound had ended. What I thought was strange about the sound was that it was quite powerful and was clearly being generated from this vessel however the craft itself was moving very very slow. I immediately sought out this web site because I am convinced that what I saw was an UFO. I live in the city I am used to seeing airplanes and helicopters, and even those small planes that advertise signs and blimps. This was certaintly not a craft I am familar with. It was round and disk like, it's light was unusually, clear and bright, and it flew straight up! Very very slowly. I hope that someone else in this area saw it was I will not feel crazy.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Disk shape object with lights in the sky over LA;2013-10-19 13:13:00;26 minutes;Disk shape object with lights in the sky over LA 3rd time seeing UFO.  Went outside in my backyard again seems I seem them on the weekend when I am at home most of the day and I spotted a UFO hovering over LA again really high in the same spot as it was before the previous week when I reported it this time the time I spotted it was at 1:13pm.  I grabbed my binoculars and could see a disk shape and under it 4 red lights in a diamond shape that changed colors from red to white or yellow and the lights moved in different formations it started to moved slowly almost over my house going south then slowly back to the spot I first seen it which was north west.  It was right above the path of planes that leave LAX that usually fly in the path over my house I wondered if any of the planes spotted it but the UFO was very high that you can easily lose it in the blue sky.  It stood hovering for 26 minutes I went inside to grab my phone camera and came back to look at it but some clouds rolled in and I could not see it any! more.  I find it odd that I spotted it again hovering in the same position as before.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
White illuminated disks over east Los Angeles mountains.;2013-11-06 06:05:00;30 minutes;White illuminated disks over east Los Angeles mountains On the way to work on the 405, 3 large white glowing disks were hanging in the air above the San Bernardino mountains in the east.  They were all parallel to one another but at about a 26 degree angle from the horizon.   At first I thought that they maybe vapor trails but they did not change in shape and were self illuminating.  When first appearing they seemed closer but then they appeared to be miles away but still in perfect formation.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
UFO Sighting at LAX Intl. Airport near the Control Tower on August 20, 2016 at 7:14 p.m. PST ((NUFORC Note:  Bird in flight?  PD));2016-08-20 19:14:00;~1 second;UFO Sighting at LAX International Airport near the Control Tower on August 20, 2016 at 7:14 p.m. PST I was at a look-out point near the El Segundo Dog Park next to the LAX International Airport on August 20, 2016. I was taking photographs of the airplanes taking off and landing with my Canon EOS 80D camera as a hobby. I did not realize until getting home that evening and uploading the pictures from the camera onto my laptop that I took a picture of a possible UFO at the top left of the control tower at 7:14 p.m. PST that evening, because I was focusing solely on the planes at that time. I took 139 shots from that location that day, and the object showed up in only one shot.  It looked like a round black metal ball with a ring/protrusion in the middle. The Goodyear blimp thatâ€™s always flying around Los Angeles was miles away from the airport at the time, and it was clearly visible, so it could not have been that. ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the photo, and the object appears to us to be a bird in flight, possibly a California quail.  PD));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Copper-colored metallic disc sighted over downtown Los Angeles;2017-01-23 03:00:00;30 seconds;Copper-colored metallic disc sighted over downtown Los Angeles I was returning to work on the 110 freeway heading north. Traffic was moving slowly due to a recent downpour.  At the edge of downtown Los Angeles near the Convention center, I noticed a metallic, copper-colored object that appeared to be floating along.  It was a couple of hundred feet up and a bit west of the roadway.  I assumed it was a mylar balloon because it looked like it was drifting along in the wind.   As it passed over the freeway and I could see it juxtaposed with one of the skyscrapers, I realized that it was quite large â€“ easily the size of an average car.  At first I thought it was spherical, but then it seemed to rotate and I could see that it was saucer-shaped. The object continued heading east and moved out view.  I assume other people saw it, but I was alone in my own car.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

At approximately 7:00pm, on September 26th, my mother, father, and I noticed strange blue lights in the sky above the Hollywood mountains.  The lights would turn off and even move around.  Upon further examining it closer with binoculars on our building's roof for a better look , we couldn't identify the lights to be anything that we knew.  Therefore, we want to report this as either a UFO sighting or at least maybe get an explanation as to what it was that night we were looking at.  Thank you.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
High alt. Excess of 30,000 ft. Creeping around slow. Looked like a tiny flickering star on blue sky.   ((anonymous report));2018-02-14 03:30:00;30 minutes;High alt.  Excess of 30,000 ft. Creeping around slow.  Looked like a tiny flickering star on blue sky. High altitude, above 30,000 ft, slowly creeped around blue sky for miles and probably hours, so small it hurt my eyes to hold focus but could definitely catch the glint of light bouncing off the bottom side of the craft as it wobbled or rotated, like a faint star in the daytime.
