Soon after, I spotted the same flashes but they were of green color.  Once again, we concluded they were transformers blowing up.  However, when we watched the 10 o'clock news that evening they showed on Channel 11 (Fox Network) Coast Guard boats and police cruisers searching the beach since the event had been  spotted from San Diego to Santa Barbara and it centered in Long Beach.  The authorities believed it was probably a mid-air collission of some sort but nothing further has been heard.  My friend and I strongly believed to be a UFO of some sort cruising in the Southern California Area that either crashed or was just making another spectacle of lights in the sky.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Saw an eerie blue/white lighting up of the entire western section of the sky above Los Angeles.;2003-09-13 01:14:00;2 SECONDS;Saw an eerie blue/white lighting up of the entire western section of the sky above Los Angeles. Driving west at 1:15am on September 13, we observed an enormous lighting up of the sky above Los Angeles. It was a huge flash of a blue/white glow and scared all of us riding in the car. It was so enormous and so sudden and so bright that all of us thought that a nuclear device had gone off. We were situated just a few miles east of downtown on the 10 Freeway looking toward the west so that whatever it was could have originated from the ocean. We called a few local radio stations at the time, but no one knew what we were talking about. Do you know what that was? So as to reinforce my credibility, let me tell you that no one in our party had been drinking and we are all over 50 years old, my husband is a management consultant and I am a lawyer. We were returning from the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona (east of Los Angeles - the flask we saw was in the west and covered the entire westerly sky). This was very disturbing - what with the current political situation, everyone's first thought was of some kind of terrorism. But, it seems clear that this was not the case and it must have been some kind of natural phenomenon or maybe. . . . Please advise. It's driving us all nuts to know that we witnessed something extraordinary and not to be able to find out what it was. Thank you, ((name deleted));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

It was very small and very high up and continued to circle around and around very slowly. I kept on looking at it until it just went higher and higher into the sky until I could no longer see it...

T;2007-10-01 00:00:00;15min;Me and my friend were facing north-west a few minutes after midnight and saw two or maybe four objects flashing bright red and white.  They were extremely active moving in the south-west direction.  When the airplanes flew out of range the objects appeard as two. I was not sure if there were four initially or two moving at high speeds to appear to fly in a zig-zag above the airplanes which were flying towards LAX.  I woke my girlfriend up and she them too. Very exciting and chilling as well. Sincerely, J, Los Angeles  I work at a healthfood store. My girlfriends brother is unemployed. My girlfriend is a sign language interpreter.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

UFO FLEET OVER LOS ANGELES 10/30/14.;2014-10-30 11:35:00;25 minutes;UFO FLEET OVER LOS ANGELES 10/30/14 I saw a fleet of 21 white flickering objects moving slowly west.  There was also 1 red object that appeared in the main group.  It flew through part of the main group and then just disappeared.   The rest of the fleet moved out of sight towards the west.   I used binoculars to help view this event.  I took video and will find out tonight if it was able to pick them up on it.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
