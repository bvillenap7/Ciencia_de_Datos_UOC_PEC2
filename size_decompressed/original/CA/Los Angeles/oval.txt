Ufo over downtown Los Angeles witnessed by  a husband and wife;1976-10-31 18:00:00;5-8 minutes;Ufo over downtown Los Angeles witnessed by  a husband and wife It was in the shape of a slightly flattened soap bubble being oval in the horizontal and I assume circular in the vertical perspective. The hull changed color like a soap bubble but the color was the light source instead of a reflection of light.  It appeared to become more transparent when there was more light behind it and more light producing when there was less light behind it.  It made no noise and the inhabitants which I could see as profiles appeared to be human and it wouldn't really surprise me to find out that it was from earth as in a special air force plane. I could see the platform that the riders were standing on and the instruments appeared to be mostly centrally located except for one or two short panels nearer the outer edge of the ship. It also would not surprise me if there were no other reports of this because even though it occured in downtown L. A. anyone who has seen anything like a flying saucer is rediculed from the outset and not having proof ignored. That was my husband's report  . He was taking me to work on Figueroa and I spotted it behind a hotel on Olympic & Figueroa. It was on our left and I was able to look into the craft and they were staring back at us. I was on the back of his Honda 450 motorcycle and got a great view.I am willing to be hypnotized to give better details. I gave a report to this site last year but I wanted to share my spouse's perspective. It was strange to see a UFO downtown but that was years before they developed the land. It was probably 75 or 76. But it was Oct.31st because I was working at 1200 12th st and there was a Halloween party that nite at work Morrie's Ballroom. It was only about 15-30 feet off the ground. There was 3-4 men that were leaning over what looked like a console at us. I don't know where they were from but I'll never know if I don't submit this form. It's been a mystery for a little over 25 years and I need to know if anyone has seen a Ufo that reminded them of a soap bubble that they could see through when the sun hit it just! right. It occured around sunset going westward.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Small flying metal Death Stars;1982-08-17 16:00:00;15 seconds;Small flying metal Death Stars I was 12years old Flying on a PSA DC10. I was flying from Fresno to LA, I know it wasn't a dream  because I never sleep on flights. I'm scared to fly, we were descending into Los Angeles When I noticed outside my window (near the Wing!) two metallic Balls. The 1st object was 20 times bigger then the other one, it was the size of a one car garage. The tiny one was as big as a medicine ball. It circled the big one like the rings of Saturn. They both moved in sink, they were going as fast as the airplane and at the same time seem to swivel in miniature circles (perfectly in sync). I gazed into the big one, it seem to gaze right back at me, it looked like the Death Star from Star Wars. It had a electronic boards imbedded in it's texture and it had a few lights, I think I remember both of them having tiny antennas. These objects seemed to be checking out the plane, the pilot had to of noticed. The Beverly Hills YMCA had reserved the airplane for Summer camp that year. We had just ended our trip to the Sierra Mountains. The plane was packed with little kids and a couple of staff. Everyone had been sleeping on the plane accept me and a 6year old next to me. I yelled to a counselor after I caught my breath, he was pissed because I had woke him. He yelled what now? Your going to get it. As he came down the isle he kept grumbling, I stared out the window, the UFO kept spinning very fast as the tiny one orbited it. He bent down to look while he stood over me. On my right was the UFO and on my left was the counselor, I watched is eye's start to meet with the window. I looked quick to my right, as the objects started to rip away faster then two blinks of an eye, they were gone and he was not convinced.  I got in trouble that week for lying. I am 34 years old and ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous. PD));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

4 unidentified flying objects streak across the night sky at high velocities being chased by military aircraft.;2002-12-02 23:00:00;1 minute;4 unidentified flying objects streak across the night sky at high velocities being chased by military aircraft. 4 unusually light oval shape objects fly in formation from South to North at extremely high velocities. They went from the Southern horizon to the Northern horizon in a matter of seconds and I heard no engine noises or a sonic boom as they passed by. Due to their extreme velocities, the light emitted from these 4 objects would trail behind the objects. About 2 minutes later I heard a couple of military aircraft flyby in the same direction as the four unidentified objects had gone. I was walking my dog at night and the background was houses and apartment buildings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as public servant with considerable responsibility.

conical shaped object with a solid band of light on surface perimeter - viewed by atleast 8 hotel guests;2004-05-11 16:00:00;10 min;conical shaped object with a solid band of light on surface perimeter - viewed by at least 8 hotel guests On the 11th of May at approxiamtely 16:00 I went for a swim at the Ramada hotel pool. While reading a book I looked up at the clear sky sighting the moon. I then noticed a conical shaped object at an altitude of approximately 25,000 ft. It was stationary and the circumference had a constant solid glow- from the angle I was viewing it - it looked almost like the tick symbol  or nike logo. I watched it for several minutes unsure what it was then noticed that it shifting position where it leveled off to a horizontal position and could see that it was conical in shape and metalic coloured. I could clearly see a reflective metalic-like surface.  I asked several other guests if they could see the object which they could once I pointed out its direction. I then noticed a 747 pass behing the object which by my perspective made the object appear extremely large however I could not acurately scale it as I was unsure of the distance between the two object however the object was in the order of 20 times larger and I estimate between 5000 feet between it and the 747. By now all the pool guests were looking at the object and we watched it for atleast 10 minutes. I can tell you we were all transfixed and stunned. The object was so large and non-earth looking that we all seemed to be shocked into immobility and awe. We then noticed a warping or heat-wave like effect of the sky immediately behind the object and then it disappeared. We continued to scan the sky as we could not rationalise how the object had disappeared and were looking for it.  I was in the USA for a conference and was totally coherent . I have never seen a ufo or had any real interest in such phenomena however I have a applied science degree and assure the reader this was not any optical phenomena.  This was not a balloon or plane , their were no discerning sound, no engines,no windows . Just a conical shaped obeject  with a solid band of light on its circumference and immnse in size .;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Very detailed footage on UFO over Downtown Los Angeles on 09/11/04.;2004-09-11 21:00:00;45 MINUTES;Very detailed footage on UFO over Downtown Los Angeles on 09/11/04. I saw a UFO with a few other witnesses on Friday night the 10th but didn't have a chance to capture it on videotape. Luckily it came back Saturday night September 11th, 2004 and there was about 40 of people standing on rooftops of their homes to see it over the downtown LA skyline. Everyone was pretty freaked out and we have very detailed footage of the entire incident. We even saw what appeared to be U.S. Military jets surrounding the craft. When they got there, the UFO turned off its bright orange glow and it seemed to have turned into some type of triangle or it just appeared that way because of the various blinking lights. As it was traveling east we could tell the smaller crafts were possibly jets because of the enormous speed they used to catch up to the craft.The jets seemed to be traveling so quick but not the UFO, it kind of took its time going east. Everything we could possibly catch and see with the camera is recorded from the top of a neighbor’s roof. This all happened over the downtown Los Angeles skyline where the object didn’t leave for 30 minutes to an hour before those smaller crafts got there.

Oval-shaped, metallic object w/ 2 bright lights pointing down spotted over Downtown LA disappeared in 1 second.;2008-05-03 01:40:00;1.5-2 minutes;Oval-shaped, metallic object w/ 2 bright lights pointing down spotted over Downtown LA disappeared in 1 second. I was on the Golden State Freeway (I-5) in Los Angeles, CA heading northbound at approximately 1:40 a.m. on Saturday, 03 May 2008.  The temperature was 59 degrees Fahrenheit clear skies 58% humidity visibility 10 miles (weather.com).  At the 101/I-5 junction in Downtown Los Angeles, I noticed a bright light near the Downtown LA skyline.  As I connected to the 101 freeway junction heading toward the light, I noticed that the light was in fact two (2) lights pointing down.  At first, I believed it to be a police helicopter however, it appeared to be “locked” in the same spot, too steady to be hovering.  The almost-golden colored lights were large and close together reminiscent of heating lights used to keep food warm at a buffet restaurant.  Noticing that there were no vehicles behind me nor ahead of me, I proceeded to slow down to 30 miles per hour (I was initially traveling at 65 mph) at which point I was observing the object above my vehicle slightly to the left, allowing me to see it without the roof of my vehicle obstructing my view.  The object appeared to be at about 700-800 feet in mid-air.  The shape of the object as viewed from directly underneath resembled the shape of a human eye almost that of a football.  The lights were pointing down and were definitely not police helicopter lights (of which there is only one per craft usually unstable and blue-white/halogen type).  Combined, the two lights took up an estimated 70% of the shape in which they were contained.  The object did not produce any visual/audible means of propulsion.  Its surface did not display any flashing lights, such as those of a police helicopter (flashing blue and red strobes on the sides) or any conventional aircraft.  The surface was dark-metallic.  Thin, fine, vertical and horizontal could barely be seen across its dark surface.  The top or “side” of the object was not visible, since it was viewed from underneath.  The area in which it was hovering in is assumed to be restricted airspace for airplanes both private and commercial due to its proximity to the skyscrapers of the downtown district (less than a mile).  The nearest airport, Los Angeles International is approximately 15 miles southeast of Downtown LA.  Commercial and private airplane routes approaching the Los Angeles Metropolitan area head westbound almost directly above the 105 Freeway, which connects North Orange County/South Los Angeles County to LA International Airport.  This busy and well-known airplane route is approximately 10 miles south of Downtown LA.  It is also viewable 24 hours a day.  Goodyear blimps are known to fly in the area since Dodger Stadium is nearby however, blimps are not known to display large, exceedingly bright lights.  The object observed was definitely not a blimp it did not glide or appear to exhibit slight movement.  Dodger Stadium was not hosting any events that evening.  After reviewing a map of the area, I estimate the object’s position to have been directly above Santa Fe Avenue & 7th Street (near the 7th Street bridge over the LA River) in Downtown LA.  As I was observing the object from my vehicle (window down, traveling at 30 mph) I glanced ahead quickly to make sure my vehicle was on track before I glanced back to observe the object again.  This went on for about 45 seconds.  As I glanced at the road quickly (about 1 second), I looked back up and the object was gone.  The area of sight in which I had the object in was large enough for me to track a helicopter or an airplane even at high speeds.  As I circled the Downtown LA area via the 101 junction ramp (first northbound, then northwest bound) I scanned the area for the object however, it was no longer present.  Background info:  I am a 23 year-old male.  I hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from a private, four-year university.  I work as a social worker in an adult healthcare center in Los Angeles.

Neon green UFO over Los Angeles;2009-02-10 22:00:00;two seconds;Neon green UFO over Los Angeles I was driving south on La Brea near San Vicente Boulevard in Los Angles last night at 10 PM. To the right of me, a neon green oval shaped object appeared out of nowhere and moved very quickly towards the earth at a right angle. The shape of the craft was similar to the photo from the battle of Los Angeles incident. The whole event lasted about two seconds, and even thought the object was moving at an amazing speed, I could make out the shape very clearly. There was no trail behind the object. What struck me most was the clarity and color of the object. When I got home and looked at a map, I calculated that the object was headed towards the ocean near Topanga Canyon Park.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

UFO with intense lights seen over LA on Sept. 3rd, 2009;2009-09-03 23:30:00;5 seconds;UFO with intense lights seen over LA on Sept. 3rd, 2009 I was dropping off a friend of mine at home, it was 11:30 at night.  The sky was very clear, no clouds and no fog.  My friend and I were talking face to face and a bright light lit up in the sky behind him.  I glanced over to see what it was and I saw an object in the sky about 2-3 inches wide from where I was standing... not too sure how far it actually was though.  If I had to guess I would say possibly 20 miles north and lower then an airplane flying in the sky.  It had a few VERY intense lights underneath it that I seemed to have felt the heat from... it was very faint, not enough for my friend to feel it, but I completely felt it get slightly warmer.  The same warm feeling as if someone were to turn an intense spotlight on you.  The UFO was traveling extremely smoothly at a very slight angle (maybe 15 degrees or so) up toward the sky for about 3 or 4 seconds, then all of the lights turned off, my eyes adjusted from the intense lights going off, and the ob! ject was completely gone. My friend saw my expression change in my face and turned around to see what I was looking at, but when he turned around he only turned enough to see into the apartment next to us.  He thought I was looking at something in the apartment so he didn't turn around all the way enough to see the craft.  He told me that the expression I made was so genuinely fearful that it freaked him out... although after it passed I thought it was awesome!  - Dan;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

The following morning I downloaded the pics off the camera and saw this black, oval object toward the right of the clouds that I did not see while taking the pictures.  It only appeared in this one picture so I am CERTAIN it is not a dust speck on the lens.  I can see heat waves around it.   Also, I am pretty sure it’s not a helicopter.

White oval object traveling overhead northeast toward Pasadena CA in daylight.;2012-09-30 15:50:00;10-15 minutes;White oval object traveling overhead northeast toward Pasadena CA in daylight. At around 2:45 pm sun, Sept 30, 2012 I was sitting on the side deck of my house in Northeast Los Angeles, an are known as Highland Park.  I was facing north with my head resting toward the sky, almost straight up. Visibility was unlimited with no clouds, light winds from the west and about 90&#730F. It was a very quiet day with very little air traffic.   As I was looking at the clear blue sky I saw a tiny white dot almost overhead about the size of a dull pencil tip at arms length. I looked at it for a bit more and grabbed a pair of binoculars I had nearby, it appeared to be &quotmetallic&quot white in color, oval in shape with a dark coloration toward the bottom of the object.  It was traveling northeast toward Pasadena-Arcadia in between my location and the San Gabriel Mountains. It was moving slowly so I ran inside to get my camera.  When I returned I was able to take 1 photo of the object at about a 95-80&#730 angle before the roof of the house blocked it! from view. I took about 10 min to track about 4 hand widths of sky and my crude estimate would be that it was at about 10,000 to 15,000ft in altitude.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

2nd time witnessing two unidentified flying objects in Los Angeles;2013-10-06 17:35:00;25 minutes;2nd time witnessing two unidentified flying objects in Los Angeles This is now the 2nd time I have witness an unidentified flying object I reported seeing two light objects last week on Sept 28th.   Again I was at my home but in my back yard being curious from the last time I spotted the 2 UFO's I now have a habit of looking into the sky during the day time to see if there are anymore. At 5:35 pm I spotted an oval metallic object floating very high and very still in the North-West direction in the sky I would say in the direction of El Sereno area.  I couldn't believe how perfectly still this object was. This object was different from the last sighting this object was metallic in nature. I ran and grabbed my camera hoping it would still be there and snapped a few shots as best I could.   Then I seen a 2nd object fly slowly just below and past the 1st object heading North-East.  This object was round and appeared to be like one glowing red light.  It was traveling East very slowly I tried to keep an eye on both objects looking back at the metallic oval object which was still hovering in the same position.  I snapped a few photos of the glowing red light object then watched it fly slowly and then lost sighting of it after 10 minutes.  When I looked back to look for the metallic oval object it was gone.  A few minutes later a jet flew by from the south direction going north I would say it was almost as high as the two unidentified objects.  I snapped a photo of the jet so I can make comparisons of how high the jet was to the unidentified objects.  The metallic oval object stood hovering for 15 minutes and the glowing red light object slowly for about 10 minutes.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
