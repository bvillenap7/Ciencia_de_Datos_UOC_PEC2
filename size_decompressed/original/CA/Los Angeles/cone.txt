I watched the egg-shaped Endeavor shuttle in the sky and saw a second egg-shaped object following the Endeavor.;2008-03-25 20:08:00;Two minutes;I watched the egg-shaped Endeavor shuttle in the sky and saw a second egg-shaped object following the Endeavor. At 8:05 PM on March 25, 2008, I went outside to see the incoming Endeavor shuttle as it came into orbit around Earth from the International Space Station and moving  from southwest to northeast over Los Angeles, California.  The Los Angeles Times newspaper said the Endeavor shuttle sped in orbit at 17,000 miles per hour on its way to the landing in Florida.   I saw the egg-shaped, white Endeavor shuttle  moving through the evening sky.  I was surprised to see a similar egg-shaped white object following the Endeavor shuttle thru the sky at some distance behind the shuttle.  I did not know what the second object was.    Later I telephoned the nearby Griffith Park Observatory and they said the second object was probably a chase plane.  But a chase plane does not move at 17,000 mph. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to us to be exceptionally credible.  Given his profession, we suspect that he is a very good witness.  Please see other report from Florida.  PD));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Unexplained object in photograph of the sky;2008-11-04 13:56:00;Unlnown;Unexplained object in photograph of the sky I took photographs in my friend's back garden while on holiday in Los Angeles.  Three weeks later, while looking at the pictures I saw a grey, cone shaped object in one photograph and dots of light in two others taken around the same time.  The photographs were aimed at the sun and the dots of light in the photos which do not show the cone may be reflections off same cone.  The photos were taken at 13:55:48, 13:56:02 and the one that shows the cone was taken at 13:56:06;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Sighting and dreams.;2013-01-20 22:00:00;22:00-22:30;Sighting and dreams. I live in an urban environment and some really strange things have happened to me.   One night while I was walking home I saw this strange aircraft flying it looked like some kind of airplane.  I thought nothing at first, but that night I had this strange dream of the same aircraft and then I felt in my dream that I was in some sort of calm feeling and a bright light.   Then in my dream I saw these people but they were naked and they didn’t have any genitals just these holes instead.   I woke up and I didn’t think much of my dream but I kept on having the same dream.   One time when I woke up I felt sort of like a strangely pleasing feeling.  That is all that has happened with these occurrences.  I am not sure what these things are really real or if these things happened or were just a dream.  I am not sure if it’s aliens or my imagination but the dreams seem to feel frighteningly real.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
