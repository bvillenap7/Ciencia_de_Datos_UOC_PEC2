Not caring, because of so many ;2001-06-09 07:30:00;20 min;I was walking to the restroom from the parking lot of Carl's Junior when I noticed an object far away.  Not caring, because of so many planes and helicopters I went in and used the restroom.  When I walked back outside I noticed that the object was moving at a very slow pace.  At first I said it was a helicopter and then it started to fly sideways giving my friend and myself it's first view.  It was really high in the sky but the object moved vertically and horizontally.  I went to my truck and pulled out my video camera and shot what we saw.  It was square and moved side to side and up and down while I was recording it.  There was no sounds of a propeller or jet noise.  Then we lost it because of the darkness that had occured.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
cigar like object changing orientation for about 40 min over LA on clear day;2001-06-27 15:45:00;45 min;cigar like object changing orientation for about 40 min over LA on clear day I was riding my bicycle eastward in a residential area.  I noticed a usual commercial jetliner turning to make its approach to LAX, but I also saw an object that seemed to be high in the sky and nearly straight up.  I curiously kept looking at it to try to identify what kind of object it might be.  I got off my bike to look more intensely at it.  By that time it was directly overhead.  I could not tell if it was circular or slightly oblong at that time.  When I first saw it I thought it might be a blimp. But it seemed to be much to high to be a blimp, but it seemed to be elongated at first.  Then looking at it for about eight minutes straight up trying to shield my eyes by different means, I thought that if it does not move then I might as well be on my way.  I rode for about a half mile still being able to see it.  While riding it appeared as if it were a planet, as a pinpoint of light.  Then I lost sight of it.  I made my way to the bank to conduct a transaction.  Upon leaving the bank, I thought I would scan the sky for the object again. Nearing my destination, I spotted it again.  It was east of me, behind me as I traveled westerly.  I would glance back at it here and there to see if it was sill there.  Then at one point I clearly saw the white bright object as very distinctly cigar shaped and closer than ever (the length being about five times the height and horizontal).  I raced home which then was about a block away to view it through my binoculars. By the time I got to see it through my binoculars it was drifting northeasterly and still seemed to be quite high.  It was a bright white color with a red hue along the bottom (this hue could have been cause by refraction of the binoculars). It was fading in the distance and no longer horizontal.  It faded into the distance looking again as a star and then no longer visible. I called my three sons to view the object, but by that time it was to far for them to see. I do have very acute vision as compared to them. The whole experience could have lasted! 30 to 4 0 minutes, most of my time being spent in the bank.  There were no distinguishable features on the object--no windows, no wings, no projections. It did not move like a balloon.  There was wind, but the object did not drift with the wind.  The wind actually was blowing about 10 mph from north to south at the time it was directly overhead, but it did not move for that time it was directly overhead for about eight minutes.  It was a gorgeous day, no clouds at all and no overcast--great visability.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Low Flying Cigar shaped object with no lights at night followed by helicopter(s);2002-05-08 21:20:00;90 seconds;Low Flying Cigar shaped object with no lights at night followed by helicopter(s) At approxmiately 9:20 PM I was in my apartment with my room mate and we heard a loud helicopter engine type sound. Our apartment is on the side of a hill in the Silverlake area adjacent to the Highway 5 freeway. The balcony faces East, and I went on to the balcony to see what the helicopter was doing. As I looked up, I saw the red lights of the helicopter and then I saw that there was something next to it. The thing next to it was hard to see as it had no lights on but there was clearly the outline of some type of flying machine but it had no lights on and it was flying next to the helicopter. I observed it as they went North East from where I was facing, over what is the City of Glendale. It went about a mile or two to the point where I could no longer see the object, just the red lights of the helicopter. Then I saw the red lights coming closer, heading South West from Glendale. Soon the object came back into view, and it was clear that it was a cigar shaped object, similiar in shape and form to that of a Boeing 737 but it had absolutely no lights on, I could see the sillouhette travelling through the bright night city sky. I yelled for my room mate to come to the balcony so I could be sure I was not the only person seeing this. After straining his eyes (he wears glasses, I have 20/20 vision) he saw it and became excited and suggested we go to the roof. There were now two helicopters following it. It went over the area of San Fernando Road not far from Glendale's Forest Lawn cemetery. There was a marine layer in the air and I could see the object go through the low clouds as it made it's way southwest towards downtown. It continued in the direction of downtown Los Angeles and Dodger Stadium. It passed behind a hill and I could no longer see the helicopters or the object. Phone calls to the local police and media brought no answers. The object did not reappear. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found him to be quite credible as a witness.  We do not know what it was he saw.  PD));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
HUGE flying craft with 3-5 blindingly bright horizontal lights flying low overhead;2003-01-02 19:20:00;3-5 min.;HUGE flying craft with 3-5 blindingly bright horizontal lights flying low overhead I was driving east on the 10 Fwy from Santa Monica towards Los Angeles in the middle of the city and saw a huge flying craft approaching overhead very fast. At first we (my kids and I) thought it was an airplane, but I have never seen a plane fly that low over the freeway before, nor with such blinding lights. I could barely look at the lights, also instead of lights on a (Plane's) wings, we saw no wings but 3-5 lights in a horizontal row with a red light above the white lights. The object got frighteningly close -- to the point where my oldest daughter and I became very scared. It passed over head and away from my line of vision (I was driving). Afterwards we both said we had NEVER seen anything so huge, bright or close. We also realized that there had been no noise.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
White streaks, angled down as if landing;2004-03-07 16:30:00;20 minutes;White streaks, angled down as if landing Saw lights slowly streaking across the sky.  Not an ordinary plane jet. First, the tail or trail if that is what it was, was perfectly straight on a very very windy day.  It was not drawn out by the wind or made fuzzy or anything.  It looked like a white needle against the sky.  Second, it took about 15 minutes to move across the horizon.  If what I saw was an exhaust tail, the tail was big enough to indicate the plane was moving very very fast, yet it could not have been, since it took 15-20 minutes to move across the sky.  Third, unless the object was very far away, but in that case I should not have been able to see it with the naked eye unless it was huge.  Also, if they were moving that fast I should have heard some sort of sonic booming - I heard nothing.  Fourth, they were flying over mountains, and were angled down 20 degrees as if landing.  This is odd.  Fifth, there were 3-4 (at least, the first one was already in the sky when I started and the last was still in the sky when I left), which is also strange.  Sixth, the crafts were flying right underneath the sun, which could mean absolutely nothing, or could fit in to something else.  At the same time and day, in the same mountainous area, I also saw a wingless plane flying overhead.  It was red/ silverish in color (not illuminated - but like paint), had no wings, and was sort of hover flying.  It was down so low I could make out its shape, yet it wasn't moving very fast overhead.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
afternoon silver cigar-UFO hovers near Westwood/UCLA;2006-07-06 13:27:00;1-minute;afternoon silver cigar-UFO hovers near Westwood/UCLA While traveling easternly (by bus) down Wilshire Boulevard (near the Westwood Blvd. intersection) I looked left (toward the north) and saw a bright, silver cigar-UFO hovering perfectly still about a mile away at about hi-rise building height (i.e., twenty-floors up) it was lower than the hills behind it, was as long as my index-finger at arms-length, and had around 5 ball-like serrations with a whitish hue.  As the bus moved away from it, the UFO's color changed to an almost imperceptible flat-gray due to the angle of the reflected sun-light it disappeared after a tree blocked its view (as the bus slowly traveled in traffic) and after other-passengers started noticing it.  Within a few minutes, two common-looking helicopters were seen ahead of the bus racing towards the UFO's area (while traveling in a westernly direction).  The day was perfect summer-weather:  no clouds, blue skies, slight breeze and sunny.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Two objects over Los Angeles on a Sunday afternoon.;2007-03-11 16:45:00;30 min.;Two objects over Los Angeles on a Sunday afternoon. I was out on my balacony watching two low flying planes for a couple minutes when I noticed a white/reflected object high up in the sky over the two planes. I am not good at estimating distances, however it was a very clear and hot day and the object seemed to be higher up than even the 747's that where landing and taking off from LAX. I watched the object dart around once in a while and go left to right faster than the planes flying into the airport. As the object was at a rest and hovering still another object came from what seemed like nowhere and started circling the other. The two objects were the same size and began to fly what looked like over the two planes only the objects were a lot higher up. This lasted a while and one object would disappear and come back. At this time I called my boyfriend out and after a few minutes of trying to show him where to look he finally saw the object. I told him to keep watching because I just knew the other object would come back out again and start doing what looked like playing with the other object. And it did! It came up right next to the first object and then dropped way down and they both stayed at a hover for a few minutes. My boyfriend had never seen anything like this before that he couldn't explain, and this has been the 5th sighting for me. It felt good to have him see these things because you start to wonder if you are imagining it after a while. He tracked one and I would track the other as they would appear and disappear until minutes later we lost sight on them both. What a feeling came over me! I felt so calm and relaxed yet really excited to be able to see those objects for such a long period of time!;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

I doubt it was Santa Monica airport traffic, as I had already driven south of the airport, plus the craft seemed to large to land at that small airport. craft had white and red blinking lights. could not make out any distinct shape of the craft itself.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
cigar shaped object hovers next to Los Angeles Fwy, vanishes in plain daylight;2007-10-13 17:30:00;13-15 seconds;cigar shaped object hovers next to Los Angeles Fwy, vanishes in plain daylight On Saturday October 13th at approximately 5:30 pm, my wife and I were traveling southbound on Interstate-5 in Los Angeles, CA. Weather conditions were sunny and warm, approximately 75 degrees Fahrenheit, relatively cloudless. I was driving and my wife sat in the front passenger seat. As we passed through the area where I-5 intersects Highway 134, we both observed a very large elongated object hovering just east of that intersection, which from our vantage point would be to our left. It seemed to be no more than ½ mile from us and no more than 2 thousand feet in altitude (my estimate). The object was dull, dark grey in color, no windows. Our initial thought was that we were looking at a blimp, except for the fact that it was 2 to 3 times the length of some of the commercial blimps we normally see. The object was closer in size to WWII-era zeppelins The object we saw had no markings, no tail fins, and no underbelly cab. My driving speed at the time went with the flow of traffic, which I estimate to have been approximately 65-70 mph. Traffic was brisk, yet there were plenty of vehicles on the road. We both observed the object for maybe 8-10 seconds before a line of roadside trees momentarily blocked our view of the object. Our view of the object was obstructed at the most for 3 seconds before we passed the trees. Upon passing said trees, we realized the object was gone from where we had been observing it, and instead we noticed a small circular object far in the distance, now seemingly many miles east of our location, as it appeared to be very close to the adjacent San Gabriel Mtns.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Cigar shaped craft, extremely faint with lights flashing from left to right and back.;2008-04-04 20:45:00;20 minutes;Cigar shaped craft, extremely faint with lights flashing from left to right and back. Around 8:45pm on Saturday night myself and another witness were on our patio outside when we noticed a faint cigar/straight line of something white that appeared to be wavering, as an asphalt road looks in the distance in extreme heat.  The sky was clear with no clouds visible.  It moved very slowly, appeared to be high altitude and was changing directions.  Being next to LAX we could easily compare it and it's movement to other familiar aircraft flying by in the sky.  Every now and then very faint lights could be seen flashing from left to right and back again in a single row along what we could view as the body of the object.  It's body position did not remain parallel to the horizon as other aircraft flying by were.  At the final point we viewed it, it was perpendicular to the horizon.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Black ciggar shape craft.;2008-06-19 19:45:00;Griffith Park;Black ciggar shape craft. On Thursday when the sun was going down I was on the 94 bus line. I looked out the window of the bus and seen a large cigar shape craft. It was above the hills next to the 5 Fwy. The object was hovering still for a minute, made no sound, then slowly flew at an angle. I looked behind me to see if anyone was watching and the man behind me gave me a strange look and turned to see again. Then this craft flew off very fast and vanished. I live in the area and the size of it was fare too big to be a plane, and I'm sure other people driving on the freeway must have seen it also.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

A possible UFO cigar-ed shaped is moving and hovering in the air for about 20 minutes while airplanes land and take off LAX airport.;2010-12-06 12:00:00;20 to 30 minutes;A possible UFO cigar-ed shaped is moving and hovering in the air for about 20 minutes while airplanes land and take off LAX airport. On December 6th, 2010 around 11:00am to 11:30am, as I was having lunch on the roof top of my school,I was facing southwest, when out of the right corner of my eye I observed one cigar shaped craft hovering and then moving slowly across the horizon heading east. I let it go for about 10 minutes and then realize there are planes in the background landing and taking off from LAX Airport. I quickly rush to the end edge of the roof and am able to make out the craft well. Its a long cigar shaped object thats black or dark gray, there are no visible lights and the object doesn't reflect light. Every 3 to 5 minutes the craft would stop. I could see at least 5 airplanes flying right by the craft. I tried to tell myself it was a blimp or helicopter but this thing would completely stop for minutes at a time and just hover. One more thing that was strange was in the background theres a mountain like a  huge mesa almost like where the Hollywood sign is. As the craft pass! ed I saw a bright flashing coming from the mesa mountain, almost like taking pictures from a professional camera but big, it was bright and I could see it for miles away.As the craft passed the flashing stop and it continued to hover and move slowly. I was Able to take one clear picture of the craft. I tried taking video but I was unsuccessful because I have no video zoom so you couldn't see anything. The sun was also pointing in my direction.The craft then kept moving east till I lost sight because there was a building office in front of me. I couldn't see where I was pointing my Iphone but when I returned home I could clearly make it out. I used Windows picture system and I was able to zoom in. I was Shocked, it a long cigar shaped object with no visible attachments or helicopter propellers. The same day On December 6th, 2010 over LAX Multiple UFO were spotted forming a V-shaped.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
