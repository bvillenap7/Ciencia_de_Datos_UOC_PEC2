low flying 5 light chevron;1992-07-15 23:00:00;15 sec;low flying 5 light chevron i was walking down the hill from my residence in the hollywood hills with a friend. i saw 5 lights tightly grouped in a 'v' shape flying low over the trees, hugging the terrain. the lights maintained their form as they silently slid along. i didn't/don't really believe in aliens on this planet - however, i work in film and television, and know of absolutely no way to create this effect with lights or lasers, or anything else known to man..... unless it came from lasers on a satellite.... though i know the gov't has these capabilities from my military days in albaquerque, i can't imagine any motivation for the event.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Witnessed an very dull gray object flying around in circles and figure 8's.  Too fast and too silent for any aircraft.;1999-10-18 01:45:00;5-10 min;Witnessed an very dull gray object flying around in circles and figure 8's.  Too fast and too silent for any aircraft. I almost posted this to a newsgroup last night, but I didn't want my e-mail address to be floating around or have people write me or flame me.  I found this site this morning so here is where I will post it: I was outside with my mother while she smoked and I began to look up at the stars.  After a short while, I was facing NW but looking almost straight up when I noticed what I first thought was an owl flying around.  Then I realized that the flight pattern - tight figure 8's and circles - and speed it was flying at would be impossible for a bird or plane.  I watched it further and noted the shape, it had the chevron shape - almost like a boomerang - but the color was kind of like what a gray or silver car would look like by starlight alone.  The size or altitude was hard to tell because there were no buildings or mountains around it, it was almost straight up from my house. I told my mother about it and it took her sometime to finally see it.  By this time, the object's erratic flight had placed it almost directly above the house.  She ran inside to get some small binoculars, we have no video camera and it was too dim for a photograph.  While she was inside, I noticed a plane approaching the object from the north.  The plane must have been very high up because I did not hear it but I could see lights.  When the plane got to within what to me was about 8-10 inches, the object began to move towards the south while still flying it circular patterns.  It made a final 2 circles and then turned and sped away in a straight line to the south.  I watched it for as long as I could but I eventually lost in the glare of the LA lights. You may contact me if you think it is necessary.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Chevron shaped flying object with round lights...;2001-04-29 19:30:00;30 seconds;Chevron shaped flying object with round lights... My 10 year old daughter and I were out walking on Bentley Avenue when I noticed what looked like a line of balls or balloons flying silently and quickly overhead. It was dusk, though I was able to clearly make out the craft as it flew overhead. As I looked closer, I noted that the white balls were attached to the bottom of a chevron shaped glider type craft. It made no noise that I could discern. It seemed somewhat low to the ground and was silent. It was not brightly illuminated. We observed it for approximately 25-30 seconds... p.s. On November 14, 1982, I saw another flying object in this same area when I was a student at UCLA!;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
A large chevron shape of red twinkling lights slowly moving across the sky in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, CA;2002-07-23 22:00:00;7  to 10 minutes;A large chevron shape of red twinkling lights slowly moving across the sky in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, CA I was outside of my Dad's in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, CA. I was talking to my neighbor when I noticed a large chevron shape of red twinkling lights slowly moving across the sky. I pointed it out to my neighbor and we watched this shape of lights move slowly across the sky. We could not make out a mass, only the lights lighting in a pattern back and forth across the chevron shape. My Dad's house is in the flight pattern of LA International Airport, however the planes fly in an East to West or West to East flight pattern. This object was moving in a North to South pattern. An airplane flew over the object and was much smaller in comparison. It couldn't have been an airplane, it was just too big and moving too slowly and it didn't make a sound.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
incomplete V formation of red flashing lights flying.;2008-11-14 18:30:00;10 minutes;incomplete V formation of red flashing lights flying. at approximately 6:30 p.m. on Friday, November 14, 2008, my husband I observed a sort of inverted, check-marked shape, or incomplete V, assembly of red lights fly across the sky. this was in the west los angeles, california area, and the assemblage of lights flew from south to north. at the point of the V, there was one bright light.  my husband thought it was actually a cluster of three lights. on the west side of the V, the short side, there were perhaps three to four lights.  on the east side, the longer side, there may have been five to eight lights.  incredibly, i did not count them!  there was no body to the lights - as they passed over the sky, we could see them pass over the stars, so it looked like a very well-controlled flying formation of red lights that blinked and flashed (except for the central, large light). if this formation flew in a more or less straight line, it would have passed directly over or to the west of los angeles international airport, and then after it passed over us, it was to the east of santa monica airport. ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS)) follow up I am not reporting a new sighting - i am commenting on my original report of November 14.  I was checking your site today and see that you posted my report (and isn't it odd how i feel somewhat validated for reporting the sighting?!).  anyway, i also see that (from my perspective anyway), a family north of us saw the same craft and then someone in the bay area saw the same craft... i don't know what to think of all of these sightings being completely ignored by most of civilization… ((END ADDENDUM));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
