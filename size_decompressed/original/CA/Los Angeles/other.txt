ufo entry burn over salt lake city, seen from as far as los angeles to the west and denver to the east. pointy intake valve shape;1971-03-03 18:00:00;2 minutes;ufo entry burn over salt lake city, seen from as far as los angeles to the west and denver to the east. pointy intake valve shape On a Thursday evening in 1970 or 1971 about 6 pm as it had just gotten dark here in Los Angeles. My family was taking out the trashcans for Friday morning’s pickup.  My mom yelled for everybody to come quick. My sister, father and I came running.   In the sky there was a fireball that looked like an Apollo doing a reentry burn.  But it was coming out of the north.  Once the entry flair diminished you could see the object.  It looked like a huge intake valve with the small end pointed.   It traversed the sky toward the south it was still traveling at speed and went out of sight over the edge of the horizon.  There were glowing spots on the back (the large part of the object)  |)=======>     My mom told me according to new paper reports that it entered the atmosphere over salt lake city and was seen both from Denver and Los Angeles. She also described newspaper reports that thousands of people had seen it and that it landed in the South Atlantic Ocean.  She also said the papers and TV covered it Friday and Saturday but not a word on Sunday or thereafter. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

White lights w/blue halo over Santa Monica Fwy.;1977-03-19 20:30:00;1 minute;White lights w/blue halo over Santa Monica Fwy. I was traveling west on the Santa Monica Fwy. between Crenshaw Blvd. and La Cienega Blvd at approx. 20:30 hrs. when I saw a bright star drop down out of the sky. I watched as it flew eastbound parallel to the freeway towards me but off to the left.  About over W. Jefferson Blvd.  I'm in the fast lane and can't stop. As it got closer it is two brilliant white lights whith blue halos around each and blue sparks coming out of the halos in slow motion.  Not unlike fouth of July sparklers only blue. As it flew by me on the left it looked like an aircraft painted bronze.  It flew slow about 500-1000 ft. high.   I forgot all about it until my neighbor said blue lights had been seen over L.A.about four days later.  I was living in N.Calif at the time and was visiting for the weekend.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Bright white football shaped object, turned neon green and shot off horizontally  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;1992-11-28 22:30:00;4.5 hrs;Bright white football shaped object, turned neon green and shot off horizontally   While attending a family Thanksgiving in Los Angeles, CA, our family had booked several rooms at the Four Seasons Hotel on Doheny Blvd, near Beverly Hills. Our room was on the 5th floor. Since our room was in the middle of the hotel it became the meeting place for everyone. The first morning we were there, which was November 26 at about 9 am the room began to shake ever so slightly. We turned on the TV to find that there was a 5.4 earthquake.  We were delighted to have a great story to tell when we got home back to Texas. What happened next, paled in comparison to the earthquake. The last night we were there, Saturday November 28, 1992, we ate out and those of us staying at the hotel came back to pack for Sunday’s departure back to our respective homes across the country.  My husband and children went to sleep around 9:30. My two nephews who had other rooms at the same hotel, came to our room to visit.  The room was sort of a one bedroom suite with a separate living area that had a balcony. We went to the balcony at 10:30, I remember because I checked the time and checked on my family who were all asleep. I was on the balcony with my two nephews ( aged 24 and 26) we could see the layout of the area below which was like a courtyard where people were sitting at tables and walking around. We chatted and enjoyed people watching as well. All of a sudden, as if someone on the roof had thrown it, I saw what appeared to be a football shaped object bright white light come down in an arc (it did not fall straight down, it arched from the roof to in front of us) to eye level where it seemed to hover in front of us. I happened to be looking up at the sky or roof when it first appeared so I saw it from the get go. I remember one nephew saying, What is that?  The light or whatever it was hovered in front of us for what seemed to be a few seconds then took off like a bullet horizontally and as it did so, it changed color from bright white light to a neon green, with the green advancing from the front to the rear of the object as it changed color, it disappeared into the darkness. Suddenly, we realized it was 3:00 AM, we were sort of surprised that the time flew by, they left to their rooms and we all went right to sleep. The next morning, we gathered our things said our goodbyes and headed to the airport. While on the plane to Dallas, I suddenly remembered and told my husband, We saw a UFO or something.  He was quite amazed and had me tell him the whole story.  He found it significant that neither of the nephews had mentioned it, and I had not remembered it when we were all together that morning. My eyes started bothering me beginning that day on the plane ride home. I was seeing spots in front of my eyes like you see after flash photography. I assumed it would go away. By Monday, I was trying to get in touch with my nephews to see what or if they were experiencing something. The younger of the two told his mother who told me that in the night of the sighting, he had a bad nightmare that something had him tied down to a table and was trying to hurt him  By Thursday of the same week, my eyes were somewhat better, but the spots were still there. So, I went to the eye Dr. He checked and said that I had damage similar to an arc welders burn at the back part of the inside of my eye. He asked if I had been near anyone while they were welding. I told him no, not at all. He said the spots would go away in a few more days and they eventually did. When I was finally able to speak to my nephews about our experience, neither really wanted to discuss it other than to say it was the strangest thing they’d ever seen.  Neither of them could understand why it was 10:30 then 3:00 and why time flew by, furthermore none of us could understand why we all seemed to forget about it completely until I remembered. The nephew that had the nighmare said he didn’t want to talk about it, so I dropped it. Page 2 UFO Experience cont’d. I became obsessed with this experience.  Since the Internet was not available at the time, I went to the Dallas Public Library. I asked the Librarian how to report a UFO. She turned to a reference book, and gave me two names.  The first of which was in Phoenix, AZ. To this day, I cannot remember the man’s name. I called him and he took down the incident.  He may have had me make a drawing and mail it or fax it to him. He had the oddest monotone voice, very deep but without emotion or inflection.  He assured me he would look into it.  A few weeks later, he called me and told me that he went to the Four Seasons, he actually stayed in our room (back then I knew the room number and gave it to him-now I can only remember 5th floor) he said that in daylight, the direction at which the bright white object that turned green went on the horizontal level would have taken it into a shopping mall on Robertson Blvd. He said that was not logical. Furthermore, he said that green lights are a phenomenon that occurs around earthquakes and have nothing to do with UFO’s.   His conclusion was that what we saw were those lights. Obviously, I forgot this man’s name because he did not tell me what I wanted to hear.  He did not validate what we knew we saw, a UFO.  We knew it was a UFO and have known all this time. He had no explanation as to why the object changed color from white to green as it went horizontal and shot off faster than I can type it. We know what we saw was a UFO.  We were not UFO buffs at the time.  This thing or even seeing it was the farthest thing from our minds.  What I do know is this thing to me was real. It was an experience I will never forget, and it opened my mind to the fact that we are not alone. As a sidebar to this experience, when I took the film from our California trip to be developed the girl that was working at the photo shop asked me who was my trip.  Well, I told her all about the UFO. She told me that on her way to work a week earlier she saw a diamond shaped UFO which seemed to follow her from Plano, Texas, (along FM 544) to Carrollton, Texas, which is where the photo processing store was. Not just her, but suddenly I found out I knew other people who had seen UFO’s right here in our area.

twinkling points of light seen above LA, one darting Westbound;1996-04-15 21:00:00;one minute;twinkling points of light seen above LA, one darting Westbound My girlfriend and I were Westbound on Sunset in a car with a girlfriend of hers. As we parked on the North side of the street in front of a club whose name I don't remember a young man rushed out to us exclaiming do you see those UFO's or something to that effect. We all walked into the outdoor courtyard of this club and directly overhead was a small number (maybe 7 or 8) of points of light. I hesitate to think of this as a UFO sighting simply because I saw no objects. The points of light seemed to be white in color and very small, occupying perhaps the same minutes (or seconds) of angle as most stars. Yet they were clearly not stars as they were continuously moving in a sort of cluster and seemed to appear and disappear as though ascending and decending. During the encounter my girlfriend (who had lived in LA some years previously) kept shouting Those are birds!. After what may have been only a few seconds or as much as a minute the lights ceased to appear while one of them moved generally Westbound at what I perceived would have been a high rate of speed. Frankly I hesitate to clog the database with a sighting that is not particularly anomalous. Being nighttime I had no teresterial background to judge distance or size by. The points of light were very small and no detail of any structure or even reflective surface was visible. There were no attendant sounds that I heard. Given that LA has enormous light pollution I find the bird hypothesis likely (birds riding thermals could account for the twinkling in and out of the light sources) though I have never seen such a display before or since. I hesitate to think of myself as having had a UFO sighting simply because the experience was odd, but not that odd. There was simply too little visual data for me to be blown away by the experience.

There were porthol;1997-07-23 13:30:00;5 mins plus;On busy Wilshire Blvd. I looked up between tall buildings, saw Top Hat shaped craft stationary between buildings.  There were portholes where a hat band might be.  No noise, no movement.  I looked for people on the street so I could point it out.  No one was around.  I was waiting for a bus.  It arrived.  I got on and left. I walked to the corner of Wilshire Blvd. and Westgate Avenue in West Los Angeles to catch a bus.  It was about July 23, 1997, 12:30 pm.  While waiting, I looked up at the tall buildings to my left (east)and saw a craft hovering between two buildings.  It was shaped like a top hat, and had portholes where a hat band might be.  It did not move,it did not make noise.  There was a lot of automobile traffic on the blvd., but I saw no pedestrians on the street so I could point it out to them. I knew for sure that people in the high rises around would and could see it if they looked.  I gazed at it the whole time until the bus came. When the bus came, I got on the bus and left. What amazed me about the encounter was that I was not startled, not afraid, not shaken at all.  I felt a kind of communication as if they were saying, We see you.  And I was saying, Yes, and I see you too. In a way it was comforting.  Almost like being watched over. Several nights later I had a dream that I was caught up into a round room with windows all around.  I could see the skyline of West Los Angeles.  I was there with my sister and my two nieces.  Each of us had an instructor/guide/teacher.  Each of us were totally in thrall and occupied intensely with what each teacher was saying that we hardly acknowledged each other.  My teacher was beautiful.  He had shoulder- length blonde hair, about 32 years old, with a bare chest.  He was loving, gentle and kind.  As I sat mesmerized in his teaching, I found myself wanting to embrace him.  His skin was so beautiful.  It smelled wonderful too.  (I can still remember the fragrance)  He gently and laughingly distracted me from this lustful pursuit and refocused my attention on his teaching. I felt that this visit was a check-up to see how we were all doing. It was more a spiritual and mystical and metaphysical exam, not a physical one.  After each of us were through with our private lessons, my guide went to the front of the room and at a board or screen was teaching us all.  It was a lesson about time.  In essence what I remember him saying was that there was no such thing as time, but that it was a concept that we earthlings/encarnates agree upon believing in for the time being. After all the lessons, the room started spinning and we lifted up and away, and I looked down and recognized Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, the Hollywood Hills and the San Bernardino mountains in the distance to the east.  I felt as though it was just a joy ride for us kids, as a reward. I choose not to submit my name or any personal information.  I don't need any MIB's harassing me.  I'm sane, drug/alcohol free, 55 yrs old. Occupation medical researcher/writer.  None of the characteristics below apply and you know what a top hat looks like.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Shooting star that changes course and accelerates?;1999-11-10 02:00:00;30 sec;Shooting star that changes course and accelerates? Event took place around either 2 or 3 am. I was looking out the slidding glass doors from my bedroom balcony from my bed.  The door was ajar enough to hear ambient noise from outside. I was still in bed, but awoke and idly watching a star around 15 degrees above the horizen to the west.  Keep in mind that I am located on a hill adjacent to downtown LA and there is a lot of ambient lighting in the area including all of downtown LA with its major lit-up skyscrapers only a mile from the site towards the south. Visibility was good, but by no means crystal clear, hence the object I was looking at was either a major star or planet nearly directly west.  I notice a smaller but clearly distinguishable object slowly circling the brighter object.  At first I thought it was an airplane or a helocopter, however at this time of night, I discounted the possibility of an airplane as it was an unusual at this hour (I know LAX traffic patterns well and they don't fly over the city at this hour).  At any rate I couldn't take my eyes off of it and wandering what it could be.  Too high to be a helecopter no sound.  Within a few seconds the smaller object simply turned, acerlerated and litteraly shot away like a meteor- across the northern sky from west to east. No big deal, I smiled and made a wish.  After a while, I began thinking that it could not be a meteor, meteors don't turn at right angles. There was no breaking apart or trail characteristic of meteors either. There was no sound.  It was quite amazing.  What was it? All of this activity would have to have been seen over the entire LA Basin as it took place at a great distance from me.  I am mostly curious if other may have seen it...surely they did, but did they see it slowly turn and then shoot like a bat out of hell?  If it was actually approaching earth during the slow turn, then it must have been a major asteroid.  If it was so easily visible during this period of time, it must have been huge to reflect that much light for so long.  And after that initial circ! ular app roach it was moving..really moving!;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

March 19 2001 when I saw it. I was listening to Power 106, and was just about to fall asleep when I heard this weird airplane noise. Now I usually hear lots of airplanes and helicopters fly over the neighborhood as I did with the weird noise. It sounded a lot like an airplane except it also had whooshing noise, which sounded like this: woo,woo,woo, wuooo. Then I heard it stop maybe 450 feet directly in front of my window (I was in my room at the time, which is in the back of my house on the second floor). And then my curiosity got the better of me, and I got up and looked out my window. What I saw made me paralyzed - mouth open. When I finally got up my courage (it took 3 seconds) I said Holy S@*t!!! It appeared to look somewhat like the little dude's space ship from Space Jam. It was as big as two compact cars, one in front of the other, and one on top of the other two like a pyramid (although it wasn't in the same shape). And then it landed. This part is kind of hard to explain, so I'll do it as best I can. It flew for about 700 feet, then laned in a most peculier way. It landed kind of like the way that you see flying cars land, like the flying Delorian from Back to the Future part II.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

I watched it for a moment and saw that it began to flicker and move very slowly from right to left. As I watched, another one appeared near it and began the same routine. Flickering and moving in the same direction as the other one. This went on for some time and when I looked back to where the stars had first appeared, There were more of them. I counted 7 in all. I tried to get them on videotape, but my battery was dead so I just watched them all move slowly from right to left and finally into the glare of the sun where they were no longer discernable.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Dozens, maybe 100 plane trails over San Fernando Valley and Sepulveda Pass, Los Angeles  ((NUFORC Note:  Contrails??

I have never seen anything like it.  There were SO MANY trails, not double trails as if from a twin exhaust, but single trails.  Furthermore, and this is going to sound even more bizarre, the trails seemed to almost like form clouds or attract clouds or something.  Because as I was passing through the Sepulveda pass I noticed that they kind of aggregated together in a cloudlike mass - not smokey like, but feathery like a cloud.  In final I would like to note that some trails seemed to begin mid sky - with no faded trail prior to where the observed trail began - as if it, perhaps, came in from a very high altitude (or, I suppose, turned on the jets mid sky).

It almost looked in someway like a man wearing a jetpack, though I could'nt see any human form.   It moved at a CONSTANT rate of speed. I can only guess that, as it moved to the horizon maybe 5 miles away it was going 90 miles an hour. It neither dipped nor changed elevation in any discernable way. I'm still dumbfounded as to what this object could have been. It was close enough with enough light in the sky to totally eliminate any chance that it was either an airplane, helicopter (no noise.) or even a big piece of cardboard, which I initially considered.  This possibility is eliminated by the constants of speed and elevation. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Massive Object Seen Over 110 North Freeway In Los Angeles, 12/2/07;2007-12-02 16:45:00;5 minutes;Massive Object Seen Over 110 North Freeway In Los Angeles, 12/2/07 I saw this object twice, I believe.  When driving home from work in West Hollywood, I witnessed a small round object, that looked to be either a very dark red or black. I was driving north on La Cienega at around Wilshire.  Two helicopters patrolled the area, and 1 plane descended slightly in it's flight path, possibly to avoid the object.  After remaining stationary for just about 30 seconds, it began to move again, towards downtown (to my right at the time).  While driving, I lost sight of the object behind trees and buildings.  Approximately 20 minutes later, at about 4:45PM, I was heading into downtown LA towards the central library.  I was just exiting the 10 West onto the 110 North.  As I came around the curve, I saw the object again, exactly as before, in the skies above the city to the north, northeast of route 110 (a little ahead and to the left of the highway from my perspective.  I looked around at other vehicles and nobody seemed to notice it.  Behind me in a white/cream colored volkswagen station wagon, were a couple in their late 60's, early 70's.  They saw the object also, but exited at 9th St.  I continued on the 110 to the 4th street exit, and as I did so the object came much nearer to the roadway.  It was very large, massive is the word that I kept thinking.  The closer it got to me, it looked less and less round, and I could identify individual colors, including red and black.  The object was a structure, for certain, and was vaguely cube shaped.  There appeared to be some sort of boom, or large metal pole hanging down below the craft.  It did not look aerodynamic at all.  It kept a solid form, and did not waver, heading in a straight line.  It was was too big and way too stable to have been balloons blowing in the wind.  It floated overhead, and I lost sight of it as I took the 4th street exit.  I was back on the 110 heading south again 20 minutes later, and did not see the craft in the sky.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Size estimate is 7 to ten feet.  At first it appeared to be a bunch of black ballons in the sky due to the drifting nature.  The object was oblong but it kept changing shape.  It first appear as a shamrock-likeshape.  It would then change into a V shape,  Then the shape of a staple.  The reason why i believe it was not balloons is because it changed into a tube or snake-like shape. it drifted into the clouds.  The weather was overcast and clouds were abundant.

I had trouble sleeping the night of my sighting, so I decided to go outside and water the back lawn.  I stepped out in the back patio and reached down to pick-up the water hose when I came back up I saw what at the moment I thought was a kite.  I immediately concluded that the object was not a kite because it stopped moving but continued to rotate clock-wise.  I stood and stared at the object to study its form, color, & shape.  This was the (MOST Obscure Object) I have ever seen… I also noticed that this object made absolutely no noise, and the most interesting aspect about it is its shape.  The object looked like a vertebrae or back bone and has it rotated it seemed to be flexing in a cumbersome motion. The color was a faded florescent blue, and the light that it emitted was even throughout the entire shape and form of the object. The size could have been 7-10 ft long and 2-3ft in diameter. The distance was about 40-50ft above me and facing north towards the Hollywood Hills. I ! wanted to go get my camera that was sitting on my desk so I backed away from the object to my back door keeping my eyes on it so I don’t lose track of its position. I ran to my desk grabbed my camera and ran back out to my patio. The object was no-longer in its previous position, It had climbed vertically straight up at what I estimated to be 1-2 thousand ft. I turned off the LCD display on my camera to see if I can acquire it through the view finder. I could not see the object, but I snapped 4 succession pictures in the general direction of the object. I could still observe the object with the naked eye but could not see it through the camera. I continued to watch the object for about another minute ½ then it passed out of view completely. I then placed a call to the (LAPD) to file a report. The Officer who handled the call listened intently and asked me 1 or 2 questions, and then offered to send out a chopper that was in the area to see if they could intercept the object.! I said go ahead but that I could not see the object anymore s! o it wou ld be impossible for me to give any position of where it might be at that moment. The Officer thanked me for calling and said that it was an interesting conversation and that if the object returns to call again immediately. I then called (MUFON) but got no answer.  After that night I had tried to make sense of what I had seen that night and the only explanation I can come up with is that it could (NOT) have been anything explained in conventional terms and it seemed to be under intelligent control because it stopped in mid-air almost at the exact moment I took notice of the object. It was like the object was watching me has I was watching the object.  And when I returned outside this thing had traveled straight up vertically 1-2 thousand ft, from the point and position from where I left it to grab my camera. This was truly the most strangest sighting I have ever experienced… I have had an Abduction experience when I was 6 years old, and throughout my life I have had UFO sighti! ng of all different types, but nothing like the 1 I had this night. I did a little research into this object and there was some video on YouTube pertaining to a sighting that Story Musgrave the Astronaut had videotaped from the Space Shuttle. Here the YouTube video Link that will give some idea to what I witnessed: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jotdaXX1w2A The object I saw moved in the exact same way has the video clip of the Story Musgrave Sightings. Its form or shape hard to determine whether it’s the same Object. But its movement is identical to my sighting. This sends chills up my spine when I think about it. I keep asking myself what could it have been??? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

The scroller can display a variety of shapes, which, from a distance, may appear as stand alone shapes, and from certain angles, the airplane with the scroller on may appear as a lit up saucer with a light on top.

UFO fleet above Los Angeles;2010-11-02 21:30:00;20 min;UFO fleet above Los Angeles Many gray-white cylindrical objecst moving east to west across the sky right above downtown Los Angeles. The event happened at around 21:30 when my daughter and her boyfriend came running in the living room and asked us to go ouside.  My wife, my daughter, her boyfriend and me looked right above us and saw a fleet of spherical objects moving.  Each object moved independently but never hitting others, some traveled longer distances but within the group.  At one point they all stopped somewhere above west Los Angeles and started moving upward and eventually could not see them.  These objects were not stars as we cold clearly differentiate them from the stationary stars in the background.   I have an iPhone with a camera but it is not able to capture images at night time,except for the moon, because of the intense light pollution of Downtown. I searched YouTube and found two videos ot recorded, very similar, incidents.  I searched for UFO fleet in YouTube and found ! two events, one event in Brazil and another in Delaware both incidents happened this year.  What is going on?;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

It was a very clear day the sky was blue no smog or clouds, at first i thought it was a baloon there was only one it looked white i was looking at a hawk and then it caught my eye above the hawk was this baloon moving foward then sideways back up down i was using the hawk as a marker to keep track of it..i went to my car had my rifle scope and to my amazment it was no baloon..wow it look just like a jelly fish changing from yellow,red,blue in sequence then back to  clear even had what looked like a tail..what was odd to me was the way it tumbled foward slowly the whole time but the lights didn't move they stayed centered it was above me for a while it kept going higher then the whole object turned green except the edges remained clear. it tumbled at the same speed the whole time.

I saw a V shaped craft with no lights or sound flying through the night sky.;2013-03-02 21:00:00;5 minutes;I saw a V shaped craft with no lights or sound flying through the night sky On the evening of March 1st 2013 around 9pm I was outside my residence looking up at the sky. You cant see too many stars normally in downtown LA, but you could see a little more than normal that night. I was looking at Orion and was surprised that you could see his sword. While gazing at that I noticed something odd moving in the sky across where I was looking. It appeared to be a V shaped craft similar to a flying wing like a B2 bomber. It had no lights at all and I couldn't pick up on any sound from it. It appeared to be a gray color, it blended almost seamlessly with the sky. There was a small prop plane in the sky as well in my vision of the sky, but it seemed to be civilian and at a much lower altitude. I turned to tell my roommate, couldn't get his attention, looked back, and I couldn't spot it again. I did some looking at drones online and the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 looks similar to what I saw, but the V wasn't as wide as the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 a! ppears to look. In any case, it was unsettling to witness and I wanted to report it for the greater good, especially if other reports have been made;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Hovering object that changed colors from green red and white..;2014-01-09 08:20:00;10 minutes;Hovering object that changed colors from green red and white.. I was standing on my balcony in Santa Monica that looks away from the beach.  I spotted what I thought was a plain in the distant.  I didn't think anything of it until I looked about 3 minutes later and it's still hovering over the same spot. So I thought it was a helicopter.  But than a couple seconds later I notice it changing three different colors, green, red and white...  Green was green green, red was red red...  And so on..  It changed a color every second continuously.  I it was hovering for a long time long enought to grab my camera and put a 85mm lense on it..  I snapped some pics but it literally looks like a dot in the sky. So I was soo convince it was some unusual object something and perhaps like a UFO... I then called my friend and told her what I was spotting and how it was changing colors... What aircraft changes colors like this and have it be vibrant even from the distance.. I was prob like 5-7  miles from it.  As I was talking on the phone it th! an stopped changing colors and instead did mini blinking like what you see on a helicopter or a plain when in flies in the dark....than it flew  across the sky and out of sight. Please tell me that someone else spotted this and if so did you get a chance to notice what this object was..

It resembled a full moon but I have never seen the light of the moon have rays of light shooting out from the clouds.  The object was very large round resembling a full moon however the surface was a uniform color and it was emanating a glow.  No craters of discolorations were visible.   I am located south of the Griffith Observatory about 10 miles form Santa Monica near downtown.  I was facing SW when I saw they object.  I observed it moving in an easterly direction then it stopped behind a cluster of clouds rays of light still breaking through openings in clouds.  It started moving again, then disappeared.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Odd, almost humanoid UFO seen over Northeast LA (Highland Park/Hermon).  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a balloon.  PD));2017-04-16 19:12:00;6 minutes;Odd, almost humanoid, UFO seen over Northeast LA (Highland Park / Hermon) I was visiting my father in the Hermon neighborhood of Los Angeles, adjancet to Highland Park, where I live.  We noticed an object coming from the vicinity of Debs Park, traversing Highland Park, possibly some of Hermon.  We were facing NNE, and the object appeared to be travelling North, or NNW.  The object appeared completely dark, there were no lights, and while it appeared semi-symmetrical, it was not entirely symmetrical. In all fairness, it could have been some sort of balloon.  It does have a Mickey Mouse-type of shape, and the top of Debs Park does have an area where families do sometimes hold picnics.  Still, there was no wind, it seemed larger than most “Mickey” type balloons I saw online, and seemed fairly stiff, and the proportions were incorrect for a humanoid balloon, and it was missing arms.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
A fast moving red dot with large blue crescent-shaped tails in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Vandenberg AFB.  PD));2017-09-23 22:58:00;1 minute;A fast moving red dot with large blue crescent-shaped tails in the sky I was walking back home with my Grandma when I thought I saw a helicopter because it was so bright.  I called it that, but I noticed it was going too slow to be a helicopter and too fast for a plane, additionally it was giving off a light that was large. The longer my grandma and I stared, the weirder it looked.  It looked like a  bright red dot with large crescent-shaped light blue tails that looked like a meteorite entering the atmosphere, but the tails were so far apart and were moving so slow I debunked it as that. I took my phone out and tried to get a photo, but it came looking blurry,  I took a video and can see it somewhat better, but it soon disappears as if into thin air after a few seconds of taping. I stood there looking for it with my grandma for awhile and we tried to look for it.  In the end, it had to be something akin to UFOs. ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Vandenberg AFB.

It went from northwest to southwest.  It was a moving dot in the sky until the stage separation, which appeared as an amorphous puff.
