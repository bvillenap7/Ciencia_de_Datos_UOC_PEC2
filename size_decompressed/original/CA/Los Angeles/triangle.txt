The trianglur crafts move very slowly over the parking lot where everyone stood in total aw of what we were looking at.  My cousin was standing next to me and there was  a guy in the car  in front of us on the CB radio describing the scene to some one as it happen.  They floated over in a V shape formation with the lead one lower then the other two. no sound at all not even a hum.  a sense of fright came over me, I was looking at something not god or man made for sure.

Stationary black triangle over LAX area during crowded morning traffic on highway 405, Los Angles;1986-03-25 07:45:00;3 minutes;Stationary black triangle over LAX area during crowded morning traffic on highway 405, Los Angles This happened in 1986, and I've finally figured it's time to tell this story after all these years. Because I've worked for some law enforcement support companies, I've always hesitated to do anything that could have been a “problem” at work. This happened in the week around Easter, 1986 in Los Angeles. I was working for a special effects company that mainly worked doing laser EFX for rock tours, motion pictures. Our shop was in W. LA, and I had a job installing a laser system at the Spruce Goose theater in Long Beach, CA. I had been working there every day including the holiday to get the show ready for the grand opening, and with the bad LA traffic at that time, I had to leave the shop very early to make it to Long Beach in time to get in at least 8 hours. 	On this morning, it would have been about 7-8 a.m. Traffic on the 405 going south was very, very slow, and with lots of stops and starts. I had just passed LAX airport on my right, and was in the area where there were lots of defense contractors such as the huge TRW and Hughes plants. I was in a second from the outside right lane of traffic, and all the cars had come to a stop. I was just glancing around, waiting to get moving again when I happened to look up. I did this a lot in that area as there were many large commercial jets in the area landing at LAX and it was something to do while stalled in traffic. I had heard a plane nearby, and as I looked up, I could see a fairly large, and completely stationary black triangle hovering possibly as much as 500ft over the buildings off to my right. It just hung in the air, as if frozen. There were no lights, noise of any engine, and it was a dark flat black in color. I thought that it was very, very odd, but considering the area that I was in, I considered that it may have been some exotic antenna that was being tested at Hughes, etc. Then it crossed my mind that it would have been very hazardous to have something like that so close to commercial aircraft in flight. 	I watched this triangle for maybe 2 minutes, and at one point, the driver in the car next to me was looking at me staring up through my windshield. I looked at him, and motioned with my finger to look up, which he did. He looked directly at this same object for about 30 seconds, then looked back at me and shrugged as if to say, “I don't know what it is either.”. At this point, traffic started to move again, and I tried to watch for as long as possible at this object, but I quickly had to put my attention to driving again and once I could not see it from my front windshield, I lost view of it. On the trip home that evening, I made a point of slowing down at the same location to take a look, and there was nothing that I could see, however it was dark out by then. Just lots of normal aircraft lights at that time. For the next 4-5 days as I continued on that project, I made a point of looking every time I was in that area, but never have seen the object since. 	The size to me may have been about 50 feet wide, with almost a perfect triangle shape. The thickness was hard to judge, but I would say maybe 5 feet. I looked very closely to see if there was a tether as there were lots of advertising balloons in the area along the 405, but there were none that I could see, however the object's lack of movement made it appear as if it was tethered. It is windy in that area from the air coming in from the nearby Pacific Ocean. The “point” or nose of this shape would have been pointing NE, about 2 miles south of LAX on the west side of the highway above industrial buildings. I believe there was a wide bend or curve at the point of the highway. I have not seen any object like that before or since that day. It does remind me of the appearance of the stealth aircraft that many of these companies in that area most likely worked on, and I have always had a thought that what I saw that day may have had something to with that, however at that time, those programs were all still very secret I believe. Oh, the sky was clear and blue, and with the morning sun coming up, and not much pollution yet from traffic. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

No lights. No sound. While out with telecsope on 2/23/96, looking at Orion nebula, I glanced up from the eye peice, and towards the west, south west, saw 3 triangular objects.They were a pale orangish color, coming east, north east, from the Santa Monicaarea. They made no sound, and moved fairly fast. Stayed in tight formation, one at point, two trailing. No visible detail.I thought it might be fighter planes, like a Stealth fighter, since president Clinton was in Santa Monica that night, but there was no sound. I thought perhaps the color was due to sun reflecting off the craft,but the Stealth are black, not bare aluminium, and no sun reflects at 20:15 in February.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Silent, gliding boomerang with no lights;1997-03-14 21:00:00;40 seconds;Silent, gliding boomerang with no lights It was more of a black/dark boomerang shape with a pointed tip, with one wing being about 60 feet long and 20 feet wide, and the other slightly shorter.   I and two people were in a rooftop pool when I looked and up and exclaimed, What ((deleted)) is that?    At that point the other two people looked up and saw it.  There were no lights and there was no sound coming from the object.  We noted that everything around us (city noise, etc) was absolutely silent.   It was hovering/gliding over us about 30-40 feet up (we almost felt we could jump up and touch it), and the outline could be easily made out against the stars in the background.   It came from the Runyon Canyon area, and was moving south, at less than a snail's pace.   Once it passed by the pool and cleared the edge of the building, it seem to just blur/distort into the city sky.   We all jumped out of the pool to try to see where it was going, but we could not located it again. Note:  this happened a LONG time ago, and the dimensions are purely best guesses.  I recall the circumstances and experience vividly, but the size thing is really difficult to say.  It didn't really seem very big.  Nobody had been drinking alcohol or taking drugs, and we were not disoriented by being in a heated pool. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As it was falling and turing in finally faced direct west and stoped in mid air for a half a second and then shot out acroos the sky headded directly west.  I cross right in front of me, and disappeared over the horizon.

I saw a V formation of white, round lights in a ninety degree angle with approx. five lights on one side and three lights on the other.  This lead me to believe it was either a large object traveling fast at high altitude with lights missing on one side, or a group of smaller individual lights flying in formation at lower altitude.  I'm going to say it was some sort of stealth plane because I don't know what it was.  No trail, no sound.  Low enough to make me wish it was higher!;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Triangular shaped object in atmosphere 4.5-5.0 degrees in size traversing from northwest to southeast.;1999-10-09 00:33:00;29 seconds;Triangular shaped object in atmosphere 4.5-5.0 degrees in size traversing from northwest to southeast. Large triangular shaped object estimated 40K-50K feet ASL (this is an impression)black in color traversing from northwest to southeast on apparent directed or controlled path absolutely in a straight line with impressively smooth travel.  Object appeared illuminated diffusely over front edge similar to that of a bright diffuse object. Illumination appeared to be reflected from skyglow of city.  To a casual observer object would have appeared as a boomerang shaped V with the notch of the V travelling in the direction of travel.  Illuminated area appeared more greyish with faint lighting and progressed to black to the rear of the craft.  Front edging had definite thickness but curved for aerodynamic capability.  Travel was absolutely effortless as it glided smoothly across field of view first observed while kneeling on floor near a window on a second story residential apartment structure.  Object on flight of travel first observed at greatest elevation towards zenith.  Observation of travel over half the sky took the referenced period of time.  Size of object estimated like that of a small lake or small mountainous area just north near Griffith Observatory, or for most people like that of one to two football fields/stadiums.  Could only see primarily bottom underbelly. No surface features, patters, markings, or lights of any kind. Sky - clear.  No clouds or vaporous characteristics. Temperature - estimated 78 degrees F. Humid. Haze level - moderate, due to smog characteristic. No trail or atmospheric disturbance of any kind in wake of craft. Personal background:  Extensive astronomical experience and observation over entire lifetime since babyhood.  Estimated conservatively at 30K+ hours. Impression:  Impressive.  Unknown what I saw.  Definitely not a stealth bomber or any secret objects that I am aware of from experience. Written initial report to follow within a few days. Extensive report later. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness reports he is experienced astronomer, with 30,000 hrs. of viewing time, and two published articles.  Seems to be extremely good observer.));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Boomerang ship over Los Angeles in 2000;2000-05-15 04:00:00;5 minutes;Boomerang ship over Los Angeles in 2000 Sitting on back porch of house smoking cigarette, I saw a boomerang shaped ship, stationary in the sky very close above the house, maybe 100 feet away and very large.  It made no sound and as I looked at it, it moved closer to me, toward me.  It appeared to be a boomerang with eyes or windows, like a bat.  I became very scared as it moved toward me and could feel that it saw me.  It moved silently and at an angle and was much closer than I first thought.  I ran in the house and immediately looked out the window. It was gone.  No sound. instantly from being stopped in the sky and then coming toward me.  I have only told this to one or two people who did not believe me.  I am an attorney and a natural skeptic.  This was very real.  Right in the middle of LA!  It seemed otherworldly to me.  I felt its energy.  I told myself that Skunkworks the testing facility for experimental aircraft in less then 100 miles away in Palmdale, CA, but in my heart....I saw something else.

Brief sighting of a group of black triangles that suddenly disappeared.;2000-07-15 18:00:00;1 minute;Brief sighting of a group of black triangles that suddenly disappeared. Appearance / Description of Object(s):  Black triangular objects with no markings, lights, reflections or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.).  Size of Object(s):  At arms length, the objects appeared to be less than 2 inches across. The actual size appeared close to that of a private or fighter jet. The objects appeared to be equilateral triangles with less than 100 feet per side.  Distance to Object(s) & Altitude :  Directly overhead. My guess would be around 7500 feet in altitude.  Description of Area / Surroundings :  West Los Angeles (urban) just west of the intersection of Pico & Sawtelle Blvds close to Santa Monica airport.  Full Description & Details :  In the summer of 2000, I was driving with my then girlfriend late one afternoon before sunset westbound on Pico Blvd. just west of Sawtelle Blvd.. While stopped at a traffic light, she pointed to something she saw in the sky which was almost directly over us. I had to lean forward to be able to see up through the windshield to observe 3 identical black triangular objects. I observed them for less than 30 seconds. The objects were motionless and we could not hear any noise from the objects. There were no markings, lights, reflections or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.), just a solid black object. The objects were in a loose triangle formation separated from each other by a distance of approximately 5 times their individual width. What struck me most was their stillness and almost silhouette-like appearance.  My impression is that the objects were the size of private jets or fighter planes. They were significantly higher in altitude that the normal Santa Monica airport traffic that occurs regularly in that area, enough so that a closed fist at arms length could have covered two of the objects (were they spaced tip to tip).  While observing them, I moved my head to change my viewing angle so as to verify that this was not caused by debris on the windshield or reflections. These were definitely airborne objects.  Once the traffic light changed to green, I resumed driving, but was unable to see the objects again since they were nearly directly overhead. Once we had driven a few blocks so that the objects should have been easier to view from a shallower angle, the sky was empty where they had been.  Given the shape of the craft, their hovering behavior and sudden apparent disappearance, I assume that these were solid objects under some sort of control, though not any type that I am familiar with nor aware of.  Witness Background:  At the time, I was working in the entertainment industry as an artist for an internet animation studio. I have a bachelor's degree in Fine Art and am currently self-employed as an illustrator.  Views on UFOs, before and after sighting:  I have a strong interest in UFOs, both before and after my sighting. I have read several books on the subject and seen several documentaries, as well as listened to the Coast to Coast, the Paracast and other paranormal-related radio programs. I have found that this interest and the knowledge I have acquired has made me more of a skeptical observer than I was before since I am more aware of the conventional sighting explanations.  Other Comments :  My sighting is consistent with other Black Triangle sightings listed here and on other UFO sites. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Unidentified Craft Hovering Over Los Angeles Freeway;2001-01-21 19:30:00;20 seconds;Unidentified Craft Hovering Over Los Angeles Freeway I was driving home from Encino on the Ventura Freeway (CA Freeway 101) at approximately 7:30pm Sunday, January 21st, 2001. As I live in the city of Los Angeles, I am quite familliar with the presence of helicopters in my day-to-day life. I happened to notice one such helicopter ahead of me as I drove in a south-eastern direction. I paid special attention because I noticed that the spot light was on. This was of particular concern to me due to the fact that a lit spot light on the freeway could mean that there is a police chase in the nearby vicinity and caution my be exercised. I kept my eye on the craft as I drove and I began to notice that the spot wasn't acutally on at all. In fact, I noticed that the helicopter seemed to be hovering through the air very slowly and smoothly. I then noticed that what I had mistaken for a spotlight was simply one very large white light. Further, I noticed that the craft had NO BLADES. The altitude of the craft was approximately twice that of what a normal helicopter would be navigating at, yet the craft, itself, was large enough to where my perspective of it's altitude was skewed due to it's size. Alarmed, I began driving directly underneath the craft and looked up to see that it APPEARED to be triangular in shape and had a series of ODDLY-COLORED lights flashing on it's underside. I am a skeptic now as I was prior to last night's events. Nonetheless, I'm entirely certain there were/are others who saw what I did. The freeway was fairly busy, although not bumper-to-bumper. If there is anyone out there who could verify that something was hovering over the freeway, it would be greatly appreciated.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

I pointed it out to my wife and at that moment we both saw an aditional 4 red lights, light up independantly in a V shape and as quickly as they lit up they began to turn off (also independantly).   There was absolutly no sound from the craft and it seemed to be gliding JUST off the top of the canyon.

Mysterious red light in the northeast section of los Angeles.;2003-08-30 23:00:00;30-45 minutes;My friends and I were outside of my house in the northeast section of los Angeles enjoying the cool Saturday night when I noticed a mysterious red light high the sky not far from and to the north of where the planet Mars was located. After a minute or so I took notice of the stationary orbit of this object. I did'nt think it was an airplane( or else it would've flown on by now ) nor a helicopter. ( As I thought it was too far up for any helicopter to hover---that I'm aware of.) I pointed this out to my friends and for the next half-hour or so we watched this red-lighted object slowly traveled west,northwest,north,and finally northeast before it suddenly vanished as though someone turned-off a light switch!  During its slow flight we observed this object through binoculars and we were able to see this object as a cluster of lights from a very faintly dark-colored almost-triangular shaped object. Some starlight was able to provide a slightly lighter background for us to make out this dark shape. Also during its flight, we noticed the red light dimmed at times as well as getting slightly brighter. Two other witnesses were called out and watched with curiousity and interest. We concluded this was an object we had not seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Triangle Formation Over Los Angeles;2003-10-14 21:00:00;30 seconds;Triangle Formation Over Los Angeles On the evening of October 14th a friend and I were sitting outside at the Sky Bar in Los Angeles taking in the view.  If you've never been to the Sky Bar it's a dimly lit outdoor bar overlooking Los Angeles, so its easy to see the night sky.  That evening was clear with a light haze in the sky.  At about 9:00PM my friend jokingly pointed to the west and said Here comes a UFO.  I looked to the west and saw what appeared to be lights in a V-formation heading directly toward us.  The objects in the formation were emitting little or no light and appeared to only be reflecting back the lights of the city.  As I looked at them I at first thought it was a flock of large white birds heading towards us.  I trained my eyes on them as they approached looking for wings.  As the objects neared and began to fly overhead I could see that there were no wings and the objects were unexplainable.  What I saw were lights in a triangle formation.  There were approximately 13 lights (1 lead and 6 on each side in a V-formation).  What made it unusual were that the rear lights were constantly switching places with each other.  The object was completely silent and moving at a speed no greater than that of an airplane.  The object also appeared to be flying at about 5,000 feet and was flying in a Northeasterly direction.  We both watched as the formation flew directly overhead and flew over the roof of the hotel and out of site.  The object was obviously no plane as from our vantage point we could watch the airplanes approaching and landing at LAX, plus it made no sound.  Even small planes a couple miles away could be heard from our view.  I travel on business over 100,000 airline miles a year and have been doing it for 15 years straight.  I've spent alot of time in the air and around airports and have never, ever seen anything that could explain what I saw that evening.  My friend and I were both a little shaken by the event and we both said that something needed to be reported.  That's what I'm doing now.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

black V shaped object over West LA;2004-04-26 21:30:00;2 - 3 sec;black V shaped object over West LA I was sat on the Balcony at night relaxing and looking at the sky admittedly having a small bottle of beer but I was not drunk. i live on the westside of la and within the LAX air routes. this all happenind in a matter odf seconds. I looked up to see in the clear detail a black V shaped craft travelling at tremendous speed suddenly halt just feet away from me. It had approx 10 white disks (not quite sure how many) that reminded me of satellite receiver dishes. They covered the whole of the underside. There were no glowing lights. It was completely silent. I saw this very clearly. It seemed to dart toward me and then suddenly darted away. I can licken its movements to a hummingbird. Then (and this is what makes me wonder if I hallucinated) I felt in a bit as a daze as i watched it transfixed (maybe due to shock) as it moved off at high speed and then it seemed to change direction and come at me but this felt more psychological than actual. I panicked and dived into the apartment completely scaring the wife. I came out again and it was gone. There was a gentleman on a balcony in an adjacent apartment who was positioned so that he 'could' have seen somthing but he did not show any signs that he saw anything and I felt too embarrassed to ask. I have never previously seen a UFO or submitted a UFO post before.

Irratic flying object seen east of highway 5 near midnight.;2004-08-19 23:55:00;30 seconds;Irratic flying object seen east of highway 5 near midnight. My wife and I were driving south on highway 5 and were between Stockton and Bakersfield, travening between Portland Or and San Diego Ca. At 23:55 pm, I noticed a white light that I assumed was an airplane climbing at a steep 45 angle as an airplane would in an agressive take off. The craft then changed direction at a 90 degree angle and then dove toward the ground at a 45 degree angle, stopping 5 feet from the ground and hovering with the craft tilted to the north. The craft was about 200 feet away across the north bound lanes of highway 5. I did not see anything else because I was driving. The craft was shaped like a Stingray with 3 white lights on the top of it. I first noticed the craft because it was not flying like a normal aircraft because of the sharp take off angle (I did not notice it taking off from the ground)and then the sharp turns, diving toward the ground and the hover.  My wife first saw the light of the craft and the saw it making a 90 degree turn and then dive toward the ground and since she was not driving noticed the stingray shape. She noticed the 3 white lights that if we used the stingray shape was two of the lights at the outside as the flippers and one light at the front where the nose would be. My wife heard noises similar to a jet engine making different noises like a acceleration and deceleration noises, I did not hear them. The craft looked to be about the size of a normal passenger car.  The area that we had the sighting was not populated as most of highway 5 is between Bakersfield and Stockton. The craft would have been sighted by cars in the north bound lanes, with a better view of the hover.  My initial thought was that it was a remote controled toy, but then I thought it was a crop duster, but both would not be operated near midnight. The whole thing did not look real to me, so I was not scared and did not think to pull over.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Huge triangle with red lights;2004-12-03 19:45:00;60 seconds;Huge triangle with red lights While walking North in my neighborhood of West Hollywood, I noticed a red light in the sky, then a moment later, I saw a second red light moving in tandem with the first light (from my perspective about an arm's length away from each other).  My first thought was maybe military (being in tandem and all). I then noticed a third light up ahead of the other two, forming a perfect triangle.  All moving in unison, heading North.  The three lights would pulse at the same moment.  At that point, I realized there was the vague outline of a mass connecting these three red lights.  Then I watched as four or five other lights pulsed along the outer edge of the triangle, with more lights being on the western edge of the object. I could not detect any pattern to the flashing of these other lights.  A couple of times all seven or eight were on at the same time.  I couldn't gage its altitude, but whether it was low or high, this thing was huge.  If it was just up a few thousand feet, you could fit dozens of commercial jets within its base outline.  If it was really high up -- well, it would be beyond massive.  One of those sweeping, movie premiere-style spotlights swept under the object and didn't touch it, so it was at least higher than those things can project light.  I could detect no sound, the street I was on was quiet and I can normally hear aircraft (but I am still in a city).  The sky was clear (recent rain has made it noticibly so).  It seemed to glide across the sky and was just to my West, putting the object near the 405 highway.  Was anyone else looking up then?  Someone had to see this.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Huge;2004-12-17 09:00:00;5 Min;I have seen the Stealth Bomber.  This was the same shape but much larger.  A 737 was taking off from Burbank as it flew over - this gave me a good sense of perspective.  Reddish lights all blinking independently - causing me to first think it was a formation flying at night.  I could see they were all connected by a large, dark, silent object.  Heading Southwest.  If it was a flying wing....it was huge...bigger than the stealth bomber.  Odd that it was flying towards LAX.....I was in Studio City.  Approx time - 9:00.  I immediately called a friend in culver city who also witnessed it fly over.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
A triangular - silent object glided through the skyscrapers in downtown LA  ((NUFORC Note:  B-2 bomber?  PD));2005-04-12 13:00:00;3 seconds;A triangular - silent object glided through the skyscrapers in downtown LA, parallel to the 4th floor of these buildings. I am a college educated, Vice President of a corporation.  I am the most normal (and skeptical) person I know.  I was by the downtown courthouse (in my car) approaching a traffic signal, when what appeared to by a stealth bomber (triangular shaped and silver colored) flew in front of me and flew off through the buildings.  It was silent and very low.  I would have completely missed it if I weren't looking in its exact direction.  Hellicopters don't even fly this low within the city.  It was parallel to the 4-5 floor of the sky rise buildings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I have been a regular to your site for some time now and this is my first time posting a report.  However,  what I saw and confirmed on April 12th, 2005 forced me to share this with the center in the hopes it will added to the database as a footnote.   Currently the database has 2 reports of a flying triangle over the Los Angeles and Santa Monica area on April 12th at approx. 13:00  (1 o'clock p.m.)  What our 2 witnesses were observing was the B-2 Stealth Bomber performing a low altitude fly-by of Dodger Stadium for the opening day ceremonies.  I observed the B-2 at approx. 13:07 from my backyard as it headed west towards Santa Monica at very low altitude approx. 700 to 900 ft. , roughly the same altitude as LAPD helicopters, and bank towards the north Santa Monica Mountains.  I tried to get a shot of this amazing airplane with my cell phone camera but I was too slow. What caught my attention was the engine noise.  Nothing like I've ever heard before.   My next door neighbor also witnessed the fly-by.  I live in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, roughly half way between the witness in downtown and the witness to my west  in Santa Monica.   Quote from the Los Angeles Times 4/13/05 The largest crowd ever at Dodger Stadium - 55,892 - barely had time to settle after watching the obligatory B-2 stealth bomber roar past when low-flying projectiles began doing damage. Starter Jeff Weaver gave up 11 hits and eight runs before being pulled after a Pedro Feliz homer. An airshow  message board also noted the B-2 fly-by for the Dodgers opener, and noted there will be another on Memorial Day May 30th, 2005.  Let's see how many reports come in that day.

Gray Triangle no lights no sound no markings completly flat   ((NUFORC Note:  B-2 bomber?

It was gray it was about 500 ft-1000ft  from the ground it was flying so low it was almost like a plane had just taken off low.  It did not have any marking. It reminded me of the F-117 stealth fighter the only difference was this was completly flat. I was able to see seam work of how the object was put together ( I can't remember the direction they went in, ie horizontal or vertical) However the most remarkable thing is the object just seam to glide over head and there was no destinct sound that would draw your attention to look up, you'd just have to be gazing at the sky to see it. There was no lights. it flew from right to left and headed towards Santa Monica. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness on several occasions about her sighting, and she sounded credible and sincere to us.  She is investigating illustrations of aircraft to establish whether she might have observed the B-2 bomber.  In a conversation, following the submittal of her report, she stated that the object had a cupola-like structure on top, and what appeared to be a row, or cluster of windows around it, which is consistent, we believe, with the appearance of a B-2 bomber.

LA triangle over Glendale Blvd in the afternoon;2005-04-18 13:20:00;4 minutes;LA triangle over Glendale Blvd in the afternoon My friend and I were on the exit ramp where the 2 and Glendale Blvd merge. As we were waiting to go down the ramp I noticed a triangle shaped object int he sky.  I assumed it was a stealth plane- it had the same shape as I've seen on tv.  I did noticed that it seemed to be extremely thin and it was moving slow- like a drifting balloon  on a light breeze day.  It went over Glendale Blvd and over the Siler Lake hill and then into a cloud bank.  Again, we both thought it was US military, though it had no markings- a dull matte charcoal color, very silent and slow moving....

Triangle trying to cloak over LAX airport;2006-04-28 19:17:00;10 minutes;Triangle trying to cloak over LAX airport The video was taken with my cell phone from my home balcony.  i have lived with ocean view in North Manhattan beach for 15 years.  LAX Airport is 2 miles North.   What I saw was an opaque Triangle structure that was letting NO light thru.  It was casting very strait lines shadows onto the other clouds to the East of it.  Very strange..it looked better in person.  However in the video I have attached ...The light from the sun setting is being altered at the bottom of the Triangle.  You can see a very solid horizontal line parallel to the water above the sun setting.  It also looked as if something was cloaking (cloud)in the top right of the triangle.  Slow it down...speed it up...the video does show what i saw.  A huge opaque triangle over LAX.  If you fiddle with the contrast and color..you can see it a little better.  If you have video enhancing software to play with the video to bring out the triangle ship, I would appreciate a copy.  I know I saw something!  Maybe someone else did too?;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

It first appeared as a very intense bright light just over the Grifith Park observatory in Los Angelas . It was stationary. We then looked at it through a telescope, it was amazing!!!! It looked like a square inside a sphere, the sphre area looked as if it was spinning and casting off gold light . Inside was this square that looked  VERY machine-like. It looked almost like the surface of a giant computer chip , except that the lines and shapes inside were always moveing and changing. This was NOT a heavenly body or planet!!!! Then very slowly it began to rise, straight up, we continued to observe it  both through the telescope and with the naked eye. It took about an hour or so to just rise untill it looked as it it left the earths atmosphere. It was nothing like i have seen before , it was very differeint and strange and I cant explain it. My friend, whose apartment we watched it from, stated that he has seen it before. I have looked at other reports on here , going back quite aways and there are a few other accounts that sem to describe the smae thing!!! It was also perfectly silent.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

It appeared to be the size of a jet plane, and the blinking lights (red and white) at the corners resembled plane lights, but it was much lower and moved much slower than a plane. It also made a very low rumbling sound that did not sound like a plane. It moved in a west to east direction, gliding very smoothly.  Did anyone else witness this?;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Large Triangle sighted over L.A;2008-10-11 22:30:00;30 seconds;Large Triangle sighted over L.A At approx 8:30 pm on Sat, Oct 11 2008, Noticed what I assumed to be an airliner with landing lights on and travelling east to west. (from direction of South Pasadena and toward Hollywood/Los Feliz area of Los Angeles). As it passed just south of my position, I realized it was not a plane but an equilateral triangle with a bright white light at each of the three points. Each light was facing downward rather than forward along the line of flight. Each light was very bright but easily seen to be circular in shape with no glare. Most notable was that the lights were just as visible as the craft was moving away from my position. This is when I realized fully that this was not a plane as there was no tail- no navigation lights and the three lights were obviously not illuminating the way ahead! There was no sound.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

She lives in mid-city (los angeles), but the object was over culver city (neighboring city).   For 4-5 minutes the obect hovered, and moved in circles.  It was metallic, with about 6-8 lights moving in rotation around the craft.  We live right next to the airport, and have seen planes, helicopters, on a daily basis--this was different.   We called other friends who live in the area to go outside and see if they see the object as well they definitely were seeing the same shape.   Within 5 minutes, a military plane flew right next to it.  Soon after it started to move towards Santa Monica...and we lost site of it.

2 UFOS over the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles.;2012-12-21 17:35:00;5:35;2 UFOS over the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles I was driving on the 405 freeway heading south.  As I was driving through the Sepulveda pass I noticed a bright white light.  I believed this to be a very bright star at first impression.  I noticed it moving very slowly from the West heading East over the freeway.  It moved slower than a plane or a helicopter would travel and then as I proceeded to start driving almost directly underneath I could tell then that there were actually two unidentified flying objects. At this point in time now (approximately five minutes after my initial sighting) I could tell that there were two objects one craft was distinctly triangular in shape and had a different colored light at each corner. One light was red, the other was green, and the other was a faint greenish/whitish color.  The lights were going off in an irregular pattern. The other UFO was hard to look at, as the two white lights on it were so bright, I was not able to tell the space of the object itself.  Both of the UFOS were now absolutely stationary in the sky directly over the 405 freeway near Westwood.  They were not moving at all for approximately five minutes, and after that point my car had driven far too south on the freeway for this scene to still be in my view.   I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I was able to see people coming out on their balconies in their apartments whom were also pointing at the sight I was seeing. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is an excellent, and highly reliable, witness.  She commented that many other drivers probably witnessed the object.  She commented that she was flabbergasted by the sighting.  PD));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
2 black triangular craft spotted traveling east near downtown Los Angeles.;2013-05-10 14:00:00;30 seconds;2 black triangular craft spotted traveling east near downtown Los Angeles. My friend had picked me up at LAX and we were driving eastbound along the 10 freeway.  It was about 2 - 2:30 in the afternoon on a Friday and traffic was rather heavy and slow moving.  We were maybe going 30 mph.  I was in the passenger seat and suddenly noticed two black triangular craft perhaps 1,000 feet up  and a bit to the south (to my right seen through the passenger window which was rolled down). Initially I thought that they were stealth aircraft, but what struck me later is that I didn't hear the sound of jet engines.  My friend and I may have had the radio on, but it wasn't loud because I distinctly recall interrupting him in the middle of a conversation to point out the objects.  They were also flying very close to one another.  From my vantage point, they seemed to be almost touching.  I don't recall any specific physical details apart from the basic triangular shape. The craft were heading east and moved forward into a position where my friend could also see them through the windshield.  Suddenly they seemed to accelerate and within a few seconds (less than 5) they were gone.  It was a clear day and we saw them disappear over the mountains to the northeast.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

I saw an arrowhead-shaped (triangular) craft at 6:30-ish p.m. Sept. 10, 2019, while driving home from my office in Los Angeles.  I was stopped in the left-hand turn lane on Sixth Street at Alvarado, facing east.  On my right was the corner of MacArthur Park. On the left was a Bank of America.  The object was about 150 to 200 yards away, hovering above the street on the north side, about 4 or 5 stories up.  It rose about 10 feet, banked up and to the left (north) and went behind a building.  It was about the size of a small car (judging from where the building sits on Sixth Street).  The back of it was black and had two bright lights.  The top, as it banked, appeared to be black down the center, and either side of that swath was midnight blue.  It was metallic because as it banked, it reflected the sunlight (sun was behind me, in the west).  There were no propellers and no wings. That’s what made me feel it wasn’t a drone.  The next day, I called two of the LAPD’s Ramp! art station non-emergency numbers.  I never got a human to pick up the phone.  I left my name and number and told them only that I’d witnessed something and wanted to know if anyone else had phoned in. I also phoned the Bank of America, which has a security camera on its overhang on the corner of Sixth and Alvarado — four times.  I wanted to know if someone on their security staff would look at footage from that evening. I know within about a 5-minute window when I saw this.  Not only did I never get a human to pick up the phone, the bank doesn’t even let you leave a message.  I am also sure the Rampart station has security cameras, too.  I saw the object for only about 3 or 4 seconds but I saw it as plainly as I saw cars on the street.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Hovered before increasing altitude rapidly. My neighbor and I were sitting outside on our balcony having a late-night drink when we both noticed what we initially believed was some kind of drone.  It approached the Hollywood area from the North West and flew in a straight line for about 40 seconds. As it came closer, I noticed that it did not have any navigation lights.  I do not know how big it was as it was difficult to judge as a bright yellowish light emanated from the object. It then hovered over East Hollywood for about 30 seconds. It then started to increase altitude quite rapidly and within about 15 seconds it could no longer be seen by us.  The sky was clear. I have worked with drones and although it appeared to move through the air like one, it definitely did not have navigation lights.  I did not hear any noise coming from it but it was difficult to be precise as to how far it was from where we were sitting.  The sighting was filmed on an iphone.  My neighbor and I are both sane, normal people.  I am a 57-year-old man and own a successful TV production company,  My neighbor is a professional photographer, aged 45.
