strange blue light enhances IQ;1978-04-04 02:00:00;45 seconds;strange blue light enhances IQ I was a first lt investigator and armed supervisor for Globe investigations and was sent to the WESLOCK key and lock factory in south L.A. to protect an unarmed IN HOUSE security officer as he made his rounds.  The night before an in house officer was shot and killed by intruders.  We were stting in a prefab guard house about 15 ft by 15ft and I turned off the lights so we could see if anyone would come over the outside walls. The unarmed officer sat diagonaly from me in the shack and neither of us could see each other's faces. (we were both caucasions).   Suddenly the guard shack filled up with a translucent blue light and at that point I could see the other man's face.   We were both amazed.  I looked up at the florescent lights and they were off for sure.  I looked outside thru the windows and could see no source of the blue light. After the light was gone I called the LAPD, asking if anyone hit a power pole in the area that could cause such a light to happen.  They stated no.   I added this incident to the nightly report and we continued the shift.  I have no idea how this light came to be.  It lasted about 15 or 20 seconds or so.   I did however find that my ability to play the electronic keyboard was greatly enhanced and later i was tested for IQ due to an accident in an armored truck when my attorney filed a law tort.  My IQ had increased from 117 (measured in the USMC in 1959) to 160.  To this date I can not figure out what that light was.  I did not see anything in the sky due to being inside the shack.  My hand was definitely on my .38 revolver from the time of the light to minutes afterward!!!!   Since I am retired now I dont care what anyone thinks.

No supporting structure of any kind was possible.  We were over the Bayou and saw 100% of surrounding land.  Object hovered at 3-4 stories high, made NO noise, caused a mild dust disturbance below it, and MANY cars passed under it going eastbound and NONE of them reacted as if they saw it.  We almost went off the road.  No light emitted from the object, nor from any ATTACHED lights.  The only visible light was being manually moved around the outside of the object, shining ONTO it and into a small, recessed hatch area.  A humanoid shadow could be seen moving the mobile light source.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

I was sitting on my couch in an unlighted room at about 11:00 o’clock at night.  I had two long windows that reached almost from ceiling to floor and I was enjoying the Los Angeles downtown lights. My apartment was on the seventh floor  I became aware of a lighted object that did not seem to be moving.  It may have been disc shaped, but I could only see lights.  At first I thought it was coming directly toward or going directly away from me, but it did not change size.  I had the eerie feeling that it was aware of my watching it which caused me to feel apprehensive.  Then after about 20 minutes it started moving very fast to my right (south) and up.  I watched it disappear in about 2 minutes.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
High speed weird noise over Los Angeles midnight new years 2000.;2000-01-01 00:03:00;2 minutes;High speed weird noise over Los Angeles midnight new years 2000. It was three minutes after midnight ,it was the new millenium 2000.There was alot of talk about the world ending and ect..,Well at that time I was in my backyard outside with my sister an her friend,also my two dogs were there to.When i herd this very weird hiss ,it was so low of a noise that i could bareley hear it,but at the same time it was so loud that i couldnt hear anything else,and I live between two airports and i never herd a noise like this before.Whatever it was was traveling very fast it came from east to west.When I first herd the noise I wasnt sure what I was hearing so I looked at my dogs and then they went crazy running in the direction of the noise,as the noise passed over us my body felt like jello and I couldnt see clearly.then the noise went to the west.And about 10 to 15 seconds whatever it was came back from the west toward the east at very high speed and again my dogs were tripping out but this time it didnt go over us ,I just herd the noise,then it left,This is my expierence and all true.       I want to know if there were any more reports of this.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

I observed a very fast, silent object(s),  heading roughly south to north while the lights occasionally seemed to tightly pinwheel;2000-06-26 00:22:00;20 seconds +/-;I observed a very fast, silent object(s),  heading roughly south to north while the lights occasionally seemed to tightly pinwheel I was standing on my back porch in the Silverlake District of Los Angeles at approximately 00:20, on Monday June 26th 2000, looking towards the south, when I saw two white and slightly hazy/luminous lights moving very quickly across the sky from the south-southeast heading towards the northwest.  The lights were no bigger than a match head at arms length, and were spaced an inch apart (at arms length).  There was no way to tell whether the lights were connected to the same object, but they always maintained the exact same distance from each other. The oddest thing about the lights was:  A) how quickly, and silently, they were moving across the sky   B) the light(s) would momentarily (lasting one or two seconds)and quite distinctly, yet gently, pinwheel or vibrate in tandem, and then smooth back out. This is the toughest part to describe  This motion did not appear to affect the velocity or direction of the object(s). The object never changed it's long arcing across the sky in the directions I mentioned above.  This slight movement happened maybe three or four times during the total viewing time. I watched the object(s) for at least 15 seconds as it moved across the sky.  The weather at this time was cool and relatively clear.  There were no clouds in the sky, the stars were out.  There was some light pollution, Silverlake is on the Eastern edge of the Los Angeles Basin. And in the direction of the sighting I'm sure there was some low coastal haziness in the air.  This may account for the slightly luminous quality of the lights?  I couldnt estimate the height or distance, but they were at LEAST a hands width above the horizon line from my viewing position.  At the time of my sighting I noticed no other aircraft from my view. This was the only object in this part of the sky at the time. I went inside to note the time and started a sketch of the lights themselves. Maybe between 3 and 5 minutes later I stepped back out onto my porch and observed at least 3 or 4 airplanes puttering around the Los Angele! s Basin. None of them seemed to be trying to track or follow the object I had seen a few minutes earlier.  The flights were local police/news copters, commercial/delivery planes heading towards LAX, small private planes...etc.  3, maybe 4 in the sky.  They were all much closer than the object I had seen.  As my eye caught the object my first thought was shooting star, a high altitude jet, or satellite.  But when I noticed the other light right next to it I was a bit thrown. And then it did the tight pinwheel movement.... It really seemed to be quite a distance away.  I wish I could make a fair guess....  It had the type of high altitude depth you associate with the possible explanations I mentioned above: star, jet, or satellite.  It wasn't traveling as briskly as a shooting star, or as 'deep' as a satellite, this was more like a high speed jet.  Another very odd almost-unrelated occurence is the fact that I just happened to be making an audio recording while I had the sighting.  I haven't listened back to this exact portion of the tape yet, but I think I will be able to get a much better estimate-guess as to the length of the sighting based on me clomping around the porch once I saw it.... That's about all I can recall right now.  By the way, I do not claim to be educated in aeronautical devices of any nature.  I could easily believe this was an airplane of sorts just tearing across the sky, at a distance that made it appear to be silent. I will admit that I have been fascinated by the UFO phenom since my first trip to the public library in 3rd grade, so I have done my fair share of watching the skies above ever since,  but I have never claimed to see anything that falls into the category of what I consider to be a UFO until this morning. I'm curious to know if anybody else happened to see the same thing I did.  I was VERY CLOSE to calling my friend in Northern California to get up and take a look in the same part of the sky, just in the wildest chance that he saw anything like it, but that seemed a bit too hasty and kinda' kooky, I guess.  I flipped on the local all news radio stations and listened for any mention, but there was nothing.  I also did some quick sketches of the overall view while it was still fresh in my head. So that's that on that.... I'm proud to have done my reporting duty, and maybe this small tidbit will help complete a bigger picture for someone else.

Unexplainable Jet noise in the LA sky;2002-07-02 13:00:00;5 minutes;Unexplainable Jet noise in the LA sky I have no idea if this was a UFO or what --all I know is that it has been bothering me tremendously, so I thought I would go ahead and report it here.  What happened was this:  at approximately 1 in the afternoon on July 2, I heard what sounded like a jet roaring.  It was so loud as to be deafening.  I immediately ran to my deck (I was at home)--I also noticed many neighbors on their decks.  The sound was incredibly intense--It sounded as loud as if a plane was taking off right above us--we (my neighbors and I) were all covering our ears and frantically (and we were all quite terrified as well) searching the sky for a low flying plane.  There was absolutely nothing. I mean --this sounded like a freight train--like a jet was about to crash directly into us, like it was flying just right over head---the only time I've ever heard anything HALF this loud was in NYC on 9/11 (I was about a mile away from ground zero)--so I just don't understand what it was.  There was no plane in the sky--there was NOTHING in the sky for miles around.  We all looked and looked.  It was a steady, jet like sound that lasted at least 5 minutes and then was just gone it didn't really dissapate or trail away either.  It's really confounded me.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

This was a weird experience.  I was sick with the flu and awake on my couch in the complete darkness.  Light filled up my backyard (like a helicopter spotlight).

Then the went away.  I open the door and stood outside looking for a helicopter.  It was dead silent when I stepped outside.  no helicopter sounds or airplane sounds.  The lights seemed so close I should have heard the helicopter if that's what it was.  Later that morning I heard the sonic boom of the space shuttle which landed around two hours after this event.

But the light was strange and almost fire-like.   It was definately not a plane.  It was too high up to see any shape or what was causing this light.  It was almost like a star.  Maybe it was some sort of military craft-I'm not familiar with these things. It didn't really move.

red lights over Los Angeles at 10:20 pm on 11/13/07;2007-11-13 22:22:00;10 seconds;red lights over Los Angeles at 10:20 pm on 11/13/07 Wow.  Just saw something unlike anything I've ever seen.   I live in West Los Angeles - near Pico and Overland/Westside Pavillion.  Got into bed around 10:20 with lights out, looked out my front window (I live on top of someone's detached garage) facing east.  I see in the sky these odd-shaped red lights that made me think what is that?   I watched it for about 5-10 seconds before it went out of view of my window and unfortunately I don't have other windows with a good view and I even went outside but couldn't see in that direction.  It was going in a southwest direction.   I see A LOT of planes out my window as a lot come into Santa Monica airport, and I see others traveling to/from LAX.  This was going in the direction of LAX so hopefully some other people saw it.   i'm not saying it was an alien space craft, just unlike anything I've ever seen out my window.  It had maybe 6-8 small red blinking lights that were widespread - maybe the lenght of 5-6 airplanes that I usually see out the window.   I'm just now thinking maybe it was a blimp, although it seemed to be moving faster than blimps move, but about same speed to a bit faster than a 747 type plane.   That's all I can really think to describe what I saw.  It was quick, but thought I'd share and see if anyone else saw it or has an explanation.   Didn't have time or equipment to take a pic/video.   There were definitely other planes nearby in the sky so pilots had to have seen it.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

I looked up into the sky and saw this fascinating cloud that looked like a feather. I said to myself, There's got to be something behind that cloud. There was. When the cloud had moved away I saw a bright object. At first I thought it was a star, but thought, It couldn't be at this hour. I continued to watch it. It seemed to be stationary like a star as the Earth moved. I went to my apartment to get my binoculars. This took about 3 or 4 minutes. The object was still there but it was a bit dimmer. Whenever I looked at it with my binoculars and tried to focus on it I couldn't get the object into focus. When there was a moment of focus it didn't look like a star. It seemed to have bright and dark areas.  Interestingly, as I watched it through the binoculars another smaller object went from West to East. It was much smaller than the first object and I could focus on that one.

As the object was directly over us, it completely dimmed out. I lost sight of the object at that time.  My roommate observed the object dart off to the south and disappear. Video and photos will be released as well.  We would really like the photo analyzed as we believe further activity may be apparent in the photo.  The photo and video are very important to us.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Strange directional swoosh sound in the sky near LAX draws attention of 3 witnesses to look up at an empty sky.;2013-05-23 17:06:00;few seconds;Strange directional &quotswoosh&quot sound in the sky near LAX draws attention of 3 witnesses to look up at an empty sky I was returning a rental car at the Hertz rental car return facility near LAX, as I have done many times before at this same location (probably more than 50 times). This day there were 2 ladies processing my return, which is unusual since normally it's a one-on-one transaction.  The three of us were standing next to the car and going through the routine process which includes questions like did you replace the fuel and so on. I always hear planes flying above that location, as the place is located at the foot of the runway.  This time, though, I heard a very strange sound that was somewhat similar to a jet but sounded broken, as if it was digitally altered to sound like special FX for a movie. It was like a loud swoosh sound that appeared to go by in the sky above us.  The sound moved in the same direction as the planes normally do as they land, that is, westbound towards the ocean.  Instinctively, and immediately, I looked up and scanned the sky from my right to my left, following the sound, only to see a clear blue sky with absolutely nothing in my entire field of view, as far as I could see in all directions, except for the late afternoon Sun.  I have seen many planes fly above my head at that location before, and sometimes I look up and sometimes not.  This time, the unusual sound drove me to immediately look up because I was curious to see what kind of aircraft made that strange sound.  But with the sky being empty, in the end the only thing that caught my attention was the fact that one of the ladies processing my car return, who was standing in front of me and facing my direction, did the exact same head motion that I did, except she was going from her left to her right, so that we were both scanning the same section of the sky at the same time. At this point, the other lady said, That didn't sound like a plane, it sounded like water!.  I understood what she meant - that it sounded sort of like a wave at the beach, or a cross between that and a jet plane flying by if you can imagine what that would sound like.  It was her interpretation of the sound, just as I gave my interpretation above. So this is not a report of a sighting per se, but I believe I heard a UFO instead of seeing one.  Right after the fact, I remember thinking to myself that the simultaneous head motion of the lady standing in front of me made me feel validated, and that there was no reason to question myself about whether I really heard a sound that appeared to come from an invisible source. For the record, I am an IT Consultant and I travel for work.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. Although I'm not adverse to being contacted about this event,  I believe I have provided all the information available.  I am making this report in case there are other people out there who had a similar experience, so that perhaps collectively the reports can have statistical significance or provide some clue about the phenomenon.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Fast-moving white light.;2013-06-22 22:00:00;1 minute;Fast-moving white light Around 10 PM (22:00 Hours) on either June 22, 23 or 24, 2013, I started looking for the Super moon.  I saw a small steady white light heading on a uniform course away from me in a southeasterly direction.  It had no other lights on it as planes have on their belly, tail or wings.   No features of a structure were apparent.   The light diminished and disappeared after about one minute.   It was silent and moved at about twice the speed of regular jet aircraft.   LAX is about four miles due south of my point of observation.   The light did not head for LAX at any time that I observed it.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Irregular flashing light near the star Betelgeuse in Orion, slowly moving in various directions.;2013-12-25 00:30:00;10+ minutes;Irregular flashing light near the star Betelgeuse in Orion, slowly moving in various directions. My friend and I were walking back from taking the dog out when I happened to glance up at the sky.  I saw a bright pinpoint white flash just below the star Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion.  At first I thought it was just the strobe from an airplane, but after watching for a few seconds,  I concluded it was not.  This light was flashing at irregular intervals and intensities, and would hoover in one spot before moving slightly and slowly to another spot.  I went inside to get my binoculars to get a better look, and saw much the same.  The object would flash irregularly with varying intensities and move slowly in one direction, and then change directions, sometimes moving up, down or back to its previous spot.  When I got tired of looking up and went inside after about 10 minutes, it had left the boundaries of Orion and was lingering a bit to the right of it.

UFO made of lights photographed in Hollywood.;2014-07-07 13:00:00;unknown;UFO made of lights photographed in Hollywood I was at Hollywood Forever cemetery in L. A. sightseeing with my husband, when I felt strange and had the sensation that maybe an earthquake was going to take place, and also noticed birds stopped singing.  The trees in the area, which was an empty part of the cemetery with no people and many palms, started to move strangely and bend from the tops as if pulled.   I felt odd.  I took a picture of the palms and then applied a simple vignette filter to the photo in-camera (Canon EOS 60D) and saved it, not noticing the object at all at the time. Afterwards, we went to our car, which was a ten-minute walk away, and found the battery completely dead, to the point we had to buy a new one from AAA to start the engine, and the alarm was going off only when switched off/battery removed, which was impossible.  We went home, and when I downloaded the photo we saw the object.  When we returned home I had severe red sunburn even under my clothes.  Since this day I have had severe sunburn even if I go in mild sun, whereas before I could sunbathe without sun protection. We now live in Spain but I would like to know what happened.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Thought it was an airplane taking off but the angle went to far up and across the LA valley.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2014-12-12 19:25:00;1 minute;Originally thought it was an airplane taking off but the angle went to far up and across the LA valley ...  Fire stream shooting from behind the aircraft.  Watched it go over the valley then it had a white glow from behind.  Moving faster than airplanes currently in the sky.  Still in an upward angle ... Till it disappeared.  Thought it might be a meteorite but instead of come down towards earth it was going up towards the sky.  Scary ... Thought it was a missile but it went past 3 planes and kept going.  Any info from anyone?  Object was leaving a trail of red and orange fire or flames then it changed to a white cloudy glow.

Flash of light that leaves a trail - spotted over Los Angeles, California!;2014-12-25 21:36:00;3 - 6 seconds;Flash of light that leaves a trail - spotted over Los Angeles, California! It was a very short encounter.  I was taking out the trash from Christmas dinner.   As I'm walking back to my front door, I'm looking up at the sky, stargazing, and out of nowhere, with no warning, I see a flash in the sky move at incredible speeds in the sky.   The flash of light leaves behind a faint trail for about a second, then vanishes, along with the flash of light. I stood in my front yard for 3 or 4 more minutes, but to no avail.

L.A. Airport flight path bright as a diamond laser flittering flickering object;2015-03-10 09:45:00;5 minutes;LA Airport flight path bright as a diamond laser flittering flickering object. 945 am.  I was looking ENE towards Downtown LA from the Venice/Mar Vista area.  The LAX flight pattern coming in goes directly over here, Venice/Centinela Blvds.   For 5 minutes something non-aeronautically flying around, jumping positions in an instant flittering around, getting as bright as a diamond or laser beam at times.  Flying exactly the altitude and flight path of LAX arrivals.   I don't think it was a drone, the brightness intensity was incredible on a sunny bright morning, the only time I have seen anything move like that was the 1989/90 Area 51 horizon object video and Lake Mathews, CA, after ((name deleted)) gave a SSBE speech Santa Monica hinting to go there.   I called FAA L.A., they seemed unconcerned, 'always some things unexplainable'.  With the drone, terrorist concerns, something anomalous in the flight parh, I was hoping to be taken more seriously.   Wish I had a camera at the time to youtube post, will always regret.   I don't know if this is related, but 2 hours later near Santa Monica Airport, I witnessed 3 black helicopters and 2 black Osprey/VTOLs ((deleted--flying)) towards the coast;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

It caught my attention because it was flickering like a star until I noticed other colors... bight blue, bright white, bright orange/red.  It is sitting stationary higher than the normal flying helicopter pattern.   From Culver blvd/405 fwy, looking South West about a 45degree angle.  Maybe it is a helicopter, but I do not hear the blades...  It does not move.  Last check before ending this note was 2:02am.

Multiple streaks of light in the distance in rapid sequence;2018-05-25 08:00:00;30 minutes;multiple streaks of light in the distance in rapid sequence May 25, 2018 - at the hotel at LAX heading home from the week at the Space Tech Expo.  It was 8:00am. I was in my room looking out my window, north, aircraft were coming in on final approach to LAX. Right to left.  The sun was bright to my right from the east. It had rained in the early morning and my window was littered with droplets.  Off to the west over the channel about 2 miles away, there were clouds with frequent breaks to blue sky.  I was scanning the sky for any anomaly that didn’t fit the normal airport traffic.  Hoping to spot something before going home.  So, was it my imagination or did it really happen?   As I looked at one particular blue patch in the clouds, I noticed a short yellow streak of light ascending at about 30 degrees from right to left (north to south) could have been several miles away and 3-8,000 feet altitude.   I was focused on that spot and then I saw another and another in the space of about 2 seconds there must have been maybe 10 separate streaks in the same location close to each other but occurring separately.  I thought hmmm, probably weather anomaly or some kind of refraction from the rain drops,  I went to finish packing to go to catch my flight.   About 8:30, just before leaving my room, I took another look in the same general area and as I looked, I saw a streak just like before only this time for the period of maybe a minute, I only saw the one.  Seemed weird, but maybe I saw an exodus of a few UFO’s. it was too far away to make out any craft, only the streaks.  Hmmm;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

I looked out the front bedroom window and was surprised to see my entire front yard and bushes lit up by a bright white stationary overhead light.  The light bathed the immediate neighborhood.  I quickly went outside to see what was going on.  The light had disappeared.  When the light was on, there was no helicopter engine or blade noise.  I looked to the sky and saw no aircraft or UFO.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Zig zagging flashing light.;2019-10-19 05:15:00;1 minute;Zig zagging flashing light. I was doing my morning workout at Griffith Park when I saw a light slowly flash in the night sky. I looked up and noticed that it came on again but not in line to where it appeared to be going. It slowly flashed again and this time it was at another location. This flashing and zig zagging went on until it was hidden behind trees. It was going in a direction (SW) but kept flashing and zig zagging along. It appeared to be rather high (maybe several thousand feet) and made no sound. I wondered if it may have been the Astra jumping?;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Unusual clouds looking like missile launch;2020-11-12 11:30:00;10+;Unusual clouds looking like missile launch I had gone into my bathroom to take a shower and looked out the window to the southwest. I saw this unusually long cloud that had a separation about 2/3 of the way up and many broken clouds below. It looked like a missile launch.  As I watched it grew longer as it slowly moved across the sky without changing shape or breaking up.  I thought it may be a missile launch as I can and have watched them go off from Vandenburg AFB.  So, I checked the missile launch schedule and there was nothing scheduled today.  An Atlas 5 is due to go off from Cape Canaveral on the 13th and there is a Chinese Long March that has yet to be scheduled and a Falcon 9 to go up on the 14th-15th from Kennedy Space Center. The clouds appear to possibly be a Vega from French Guiana but there is nothing from there scheduled until 16th-17th. An Electron is due to go up on the 15th-16th from New Zealand. I began to wonder if it is from an unscheduled launch.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Faint and moving at an incredible speed;2021-02-06 22:45:00;25 seconds;Faint and moving at an incredible speed I watched it fly right over me while I was looking in the direction of Orion’s Belt. No blinking lights like a plane and was moving probably 50 times the speed at least. It crossed the entire sky in a straight line and went out of view in less than 20 seconds. I only saw it because there was a small cloud above it and it contrasted just enough to catch my eye. There was a single white light that was very faint and I’ve never seen anything move that fast.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
