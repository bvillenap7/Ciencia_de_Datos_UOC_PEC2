I have never been able to forget it.  I did report it to LAMUFON and I was contacted about it.  We spoke for at least 1/2 hour. It was about 5 AM around May 1997.  I was walking to Griffith Park to do my morning work out.  As I was going west down Franklin Ave., I noticed (how could I not notice it, it was HUGE) a large very bright egg-shaped object slowly going across the horizon at about 15 or 20 degrees.  As it moved from behind some trees I was surprised at how large it was.  As it continued across the open space between the trees and the houses on the other side of the street it came into complete view and I could see the whole object.  (Did I say it was HUGE?)  As it continued to move past I could see the rear of the object and saw sparks sputtering out of it.  When it got to the other side of the street, it disappeared, and I didn't see it after that.  One of the things I thought was interesting was that the light coming off of the object, as bright as it was, didn't throw shadows and there was no sound. I was teaching at the East Los Angeles College South Gate Campus at the time.  About a week later one of my students came to me and apologized for coming in late to the class lately. He said he had the midnight shift at LAX.  I asked him, Were you working last Thursday? He said, Yes.  Then, I asked Did you happen to see any...?  That's all I got out.  In a surprised voice he said, We ALL saw it.  We said, 'What the **** us that?'  It was way out over the ocean.  Interesting when an object is verified by others from a different perspective.  LAMUFON may still have the report in their files.  The picture of what I saw was in the report. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

5 red orange lights coming together, forming a circle, and rising up out of sight.;2003-01-29 22:30:00;30 sec;5 red orange lights coming together, forming a circle, and rising up out of sight. Above LA, there were 5 red orange lights at high speed which appeared to come from 4 different directions and formed a perfect circle.  The circle of lights rose together higher and higher and within 5 seconds, the lights were no longer visible.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Egg UFO over Hollywood Hills and LAX in LOS ANGELES, CA.;2005-10-10 14:45:00;10 seconds;Egg UFO over Hollywood Hills and LAX in LOS ANGELES, CA. I was driving south-bound on Laurel Canyon Blvd. near where it crosses Moorepark Rd. in Los Angeles, CA.  From this direction, I know it is possible to see aircraft that are departing LAX and making their way into the eastbound airways, but what I saw was nothing like any aircraft I have ever seen.  Anyway, I was driving south on the road mentioned before and I noticed a small, gray egg-shaped aircraft moving very slowly across the sky and to the east.  I paid no mind and dismissed it as a plane leaving LAX.  But the sun caught the side of it and it glimmered very brightly, and this restored my attention in the craft.  I don't know why I decided to keep watching, but as I started to examine the craft, I noticed it had no wings just a very shiny egg-shaped craft. It then made a quick detour from its' eastbound path and darted up (north?) for a second.  What happened next is the most puzzling part of my sighting the craft then stopped in mid-air, and it looked as if it moved toward my direction, then it suddenly departed south at a rate so fast that it looked like it just shrunk (though I'm guessing it looked as if it shrunk because it moved AWAY from me so quickly).  That was the end of the sighting.  It lasted maybe 10-20 seconds from the time I noticed it.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
I saw the returning white and egg-shaped Endeavor space shuttle in sky followed by a second egg-shaped object.;2008-03-25 20:08:00;One or two minutes;I saw the returning white and egg-shaped Endeavor space shuttle in sky followed by a second egg-shaped object. On March 25, 2008, the Los Angeles Times newspaper said the returning Endeavor space shuttle from the International Space Station could be seen over Los Angeles, California, in orbit at 8:05 PM March 26, 2008, moving from southwest to northeast.  I went outside and saw what seemed to be the egg-shaped and white Endeavor space shuttle moving in orbit at 17,000 miles per hour.  But I was very surprised to see a second white and egg-shaped object following the first object with some distance between them and in a straight line thru the sky until they disappeared from view.  Total time of sighting:  1 or 2 minutes.   I telephoned the Griffith Park Observatory and a staff member said the second object was probably a chase plane.  But a chase plane would not move at 17,000 mph at that high altitude in orbit path on its way to Florida.  The Endeavor shuttle landed in Florida (due to weather it had to make two extra orbits of Earth) on March 26, 2008.   The evening sky was clear and the two objects were about the same size and egg-shaped.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Bright orange and silver glowing ball shaped objects in the Los Angeles Sky.;2008-05-13 08:10:00;2 minutes;Bright orange and silver glowing ball shaped objects in the Los Angeles Sky. I looked up to the sky (in the west) and saw a ball shaped bright orange and silver object high in the sky. It looked almost like a baloon at first - moving slowly - but it was glowing orange and silver. My neighbor came toward me and saw me looking upward - she also stood there staring at the object. Suddenly The object went upward very fast and disappeared.  I looked around the sky and in the Northwest sky I saw another one, exactly the same (it may have been the same one) - but then I saw another one further to the north.  I know for sure there were two in the sky at the same time.  They were bright orange and silver - glowing, flourescent like - then my view became blocked by some trees and I lost signt of them completely.  I'm not sure what they were, but I do know for sure that I saw them.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Dark egg-shaped object seen in the early morning sky above the East  Los Angeles area.;2012-07-09 05:35:00;10 minutes;Dark egg-shaped object seen in the early morning sky above the East  Los Angeles area. I was working field patrol as a law enforcement officer (15 years experience) when I noticed Venus shining brightly in the pre-dawn morning sky.  I went to the top floor (7th) of a near-by parking structure to use my binoculars to get a better look.  I was using low powered binoculars to observe Venus and Jupiter, which were approx. 30 degrees up from the eastern horizon.   As I trained the binoculars on Venus, a dark colored object floated into my field of view.  The object was oblong to egg-shaped and seemed not to hold a steady form.  There were no visible lights emitting from the object.  The object appeared to hover in a stationary position before beginning to &quotdrift&quot in a southern direction.   It continued south for approx. 2 minutes, then made a distinct and sudden turn west.  The object increased it's speed as it moved west for approx. 10 seconds, then continued to hover.  I lowered the binoculars to attempt to view it with my &qu! otnaked&quot eye, with negative results.  I re-engaged the binoculars and again saw the object in about the same position.  I lowered the binoculars again to try and find something to lean against to steady my view through the binoculars.  Approx. 20 seconds passed before I re-engaged the binoculars, but could not re-located the object.  I spent the next 10 minutes using the binoculars to scan the area in a &quotstrip search&quot pattern to try and re-locate the object, with negative results. The sky was cloudless with a hint of marine layer haze, low on the horizon.  The object appeared to be at an altitude greater than 10,000ft., though I can't validate that without knowing it's size.  I did not see any light reflecting from the object, despite the approaching sunrise (it should have been high enough to have been above the earth's shadow).  It was dark colored, close to black, and seemed to absorb light.  I did not hear any sound I could associate with the object.
