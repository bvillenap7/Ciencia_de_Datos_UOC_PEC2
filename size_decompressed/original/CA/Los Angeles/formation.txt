A silver polygon object with several satelight ships over downtown Los Angeles in the mid nintey's, stops and flys straight up.;1995-06-01 13:00:00;15 minutes;A silver polygon object with several satelight ships over downtown Los Angeles in the mid nintey's, stops and flys straight up. I don't have the exact date, it was some time ago.  I estimate it was the summer of 1995.  I was outside in my back yard in South Los Angeles CA.  Clear blue sky, no wind, early afternoon.  Something told me to look up.  I did and at an altitude of about 10,000 feet (estimated, it was just above the normal flight plan of landing LAX planes) headed east bound right over downtown was what appeared to be a weather balloon, silver in color.  This ballon was shaped like a 3 dimensional polygon, the sides were triangular so I gues it would be described as a dodecahedron.  I looked closer and saw several dark collered what looked like jet airplanes with curved back wingtips in hot pusuit of this weather balloon.  Just then a friend of mine walked up and wondered what I was looking at.  I showed him and he saw the same thing (a big releif!).  Just then the Balloon stopped in mid flight just east of downtown Los Angeles.  The jets that were in hot pursuit split off in formation and began circling the baloon (i.e. the first plane went let, second went right, third left and so on).  The Balloon stated to spin at about 10 rpm.  More and more jets began to appear and I counted maybe 20 of them at this point.  After holding in this position for about 2 minutes the baloon took off stright up at a rapid and controlled rate and the jets broke the circular formation and followed right behind the balloon in a straight line, straight up until I could no longer see them with the naked eye.  The speed was comprable to a space shuttle launch but there was no noise, no smoke or trails.  I heard no unusual sound and the only thing I noticed is this was taking place in the normal flight plan that planes land at LAX and during the entire time of the sighting no other air traffic was seen or heard.

Objects spun and lighted up, moved slowly and in wierd angles. Finally one object moved directly overhead and began to shine very very bright and stood still, motionless.Others were still on the horizon in small groups.Had to leave finally.Ihave seen the same before on the east coast.

Four aircraft, in an unusual flight path and pattern, travelled, at high speed from west to east over Los Angeles.;2000-05-27 22:55:00;00:00:45;Four aircraft, in an unusual flight path and pattern, travelled, at high speed from west to east over Los Angeles. We looked up and saw a bright, white rapidly moving aircraft that separated into four aircraft in diamond formation, appearing as bright, white lights, without flashing signal lamps, that passed overhead, at high altitude, from west to east. They traveleled much more rapidly than typical aircraft approaching LAX and Santa Monica Airport. and not in a typical LAX or SMA flight path. The aircraft were very dynamic and, while in a diamond formation, shifted ahead and behind each other, while moving consistantly eastward.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
5 red lights flying in formations, then disappearing, then an orange object, and a red one reappearing.;2000-09-30 21:45:00;2 minutes;5 red lights flying in formations, then disappearing, then an orange object, and a red one reappearing. At about 21:45 on 09/30/2000, I observed 5 red lights in the southwestern sky moving in formation.  Without notice, they broke from formation and formed another formation and remained stationary in the sky for about thirty seconds.  One by one, the red lights disappeared, as if moving away at a high rate of speed, not across the sky, but outward, to space I presume.  The objects seemed to be bigger at the bottoms than the tops.  About twenty seconds later, a red object reemerged where the others had disappeared, along with a bright orange object, larger than the red ones, but of a similar shape.  The bright orange object illuminated the sky around it, with a visible vapor trail, and descended in altitude, in comparison with the other red object.  As the orange object descended, it got brighter, and for a brief moment, the sky around it grew very bright, similar to the glow of a distant wildfire. The orange object descended quickly until it went below the tree line, and the red object, like the other red objects before it, disappeared.  I am a 24 year old male of sound judgment, healthy, who knows what he saw in the sky was truly breathtaking. ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC received multiple reports from the north Los Angeles area about this incident.  We are still uncertain as to what caused the event.  At least one newspaper reported that it had been caused by sky divers with flares attached to them as they descended.  However, one large group of observers at a church function allegedly witnessed the event for a measured 22 minutes, probably longer than sky divers could remain suspended beneath a parachute during a typical jump.  We will continue to investigate.  PD));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Arrow shape lights over Los Angeles, CA;2003-04-24 22:30:00;45 minutes;Arrow shape lights over Los Angeles, CA I was sitting in my friends backyard in Fairfax Village when we saw what looked like a huge glider (12 white lights in a triangular shape), but we saw no form to the craft.  It was still twilight at the time.  When it reached a certain portion of the sky in the east, the lights moved into a straight line.  My friend and ran inside to grab our husbands, and over the next 45 minutes we watched 11 more objects with different numbered lights (3- 25), move overhead west to east.  All started in different locations (we didn't see where, they just appeared out of what seemed nowhere).  But the tail lights would start moving back and forth at a certain point of the sky.  I have never seen a UFO before in my life, and neither had anyone else there.  Two of them are lawyers and hardcore skeptics.  But after the sixth craft, there were convinced that it wasn't any sort of military craft (due to the fact it made no sound and the lights didn't blink at all). That Sunday I saw one more, but that was it.  It was truly amazing.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
4 UFOs in a big arrowlike formation at high altitude over downtown part of Los Angeles;2005-10-01 17:00:00;25 mins;4 UFOs in a big arrowlike formation at high altitude over downtown part of Los Angeles While we were talking about God with another man near W. Sunset Blvd., which is a major thoroughfare here, I happened to look skyward and my eyes got focused on  something unusual. I indicated the direction of what I am seeing to the man I was talking to to find out if he can also see it. He tried a couple but could not perhaps due to some eye problem, he did not.  I somewhat ran to a parked care quite nearby to assertain if they can see what I am seeing. Again I indicated the located and sure enough, they can see them. At first, I saw simultaneously a solitary whitish disk and a couple, and later a 4th one. They are at an altitude that makes them look like US quarter coins. They are in a formation like a big letter T on its sides. They are slightly changing formation with the middle craft slightly moving to the solitary craft and then forming a big arrow. As soon as the couple say them, they were trying to capture it with their camera phone. (I did not know if they were able to photo it). The couple were also commenting that the crafts seem to be moving when they are in formation--like they are rotating or vibrating. Laster on, the arrowhead formed into an equilateral triangle that slowly rotated and at one time stopped as an arrowhead. And then it formed a W on its side with the angles maintaning a 60 degree angle. Later on they disappeared and later on a couple reappeared at a higher altitude until I could not see them again anymore.  Footnote: Am a middle-aged man who works as a Market'g Ex for a small med. vocational school where I had the sighting. The couple in the car where from late twenties to early 30's. The woman was born in Mexico but grew up in So. Cal. and interestingly enough, she told me of a close encounter when she was 12 together with her Mom, sister and their neighbors. She described of quite huge crafts emitting different lights that hovered low above their houses. The male of the couple, at the moment this was happening, phoned to inform his mother. Then he informed a couple youngsters who were crossing the street about the UFOs. So there were not much people really at the exact vicinity where we had the sighting though it could get busy at other times.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

At approximately 10:10PM tonight I walked out my back door to throw some trash away in the city container. As I walked toward the container I looked up and saw a formation of white objects in a Vee formation. At first I didn't think much of it as it looked like a formation of white birds flying southward.As I watched them I suddenly realized they were moving way too fast to be birds. Within 10 seconds they had already flown about a 90-100 degree arc from my stationary position. At my home if I look directly west I am about even with Marina Del Rey. As I watched the object(s) move southward, in those 10 seconds, they moved from directly westward to southeast of where i was standing, an arc of over 90 degrees. I couldn't really tell how close it was from me and it was absolutely noiseless. Like I said, it looked like a formation of birds so I couldn't tell if it was a singular object or many objects. If I were to guess I would say multiple objects as the formation seemed th change slightly as it flew across the sky.  Anyone else see this?

A flock of hunreds of unrecognizable objects in the Los Angeles night sky.;2010-11-01 20:15:00;2-3 mins;A flock of hunreds of unrecognizable objects in the Los Angeles night sky. A flock of what looked like satellites moved in a herd like formation from the eastern to western sky.  It first moved in a line with clusters throughout it.  Some of the objects moved at a different pace as if herding the others.  There were two brighter but smaller clusters in front and rear of the bigger cluster the front being the brightest of the two.  Once they reached the furthest point west they appeared to stop and disappear into the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
