I heard a loud ringing noise.  Everybody heard it.  The sound was like when the TV stations used to go off the air and show the colored bar symbol, or the Indian Chief.  I looked up, and alomost diredctly overhead, perhaps a mile high, was this white spehere with 3 points on it - north, east and west.  This is exactaly how it appeared to me.  Picture a circle with three triangular points.  It looked like Sputnik, only it was hovering in the air for all to see, amd it moved very slowly across the sky, making this constant humming/ring.  It was a high pitched sound.  The sound was constant, no other tone sounds, no pulse to it, no rythm.  I walked up to the vice principal of the school and asked him, What is that thing?   He looking at it too... He said I don't know.  After several minutes it just moved out of sight.  It was hard to tell if it was changing altitude, moving higher.  Somtime later, in class, we heard the ringing sound again.   We did not go outside to investigate, and the sound did not last very long.

Exploding orb mimicking a firework explosion without sound then coming back together.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly an adv. display?  PD));1994-06-30 19:00:00;15 minutes;Exploding Orb mimicking a firework explosion without sound then coming back together re forming the Orb The sighting happened in Los Angeles CA 3 miles north of Dodgers Stadium.  I cannot remember the exact date and time there for I say circa 1994.  I was about 13 years of age when my father and I witnessed this sighting but I remember it very well.  I have never reported this before, and I don’t know why I am doing it now, especially after so many years. The day was already dark, so I believe it must have been between the hours of 6pm-8pm when my father called my name and said, “Come outside and take a look at this.”  I came outside to our apartment’s balcony and my father had his camcorder setup with his tripod facing towards the sky.  He say’s look at that while pointing to the sky, I said, Yeah, it’s a big star, he smiles and say’s wait, pay attention.   We both start looking at the same object which looked like a blue star, when suddenly, it explodes just like a firework when all the lights expand with no noise and disappear.  After it would disappear, several seconds later, all lights would come back together as if you would push rewind and watch it being put back together forming the Orb again, it repeated this several times.  It was weird it was if the orb was exploding (pulsing) out these blue lights just like a firework.   This thing whatever it was would suddenly move hundreds of feet in an instant.  It would move in any direction up, down, left right, it was crazy and amazing at the same time.  We didn’t know what we were looking at but we were not scared.  It did the moving and exploding around several times until it just shot up into the sky at an incredible speed looking like a shooting star leaving the earth.   This was the first of many sightings I have had.  I assure you this is no hoax and I have nothing to gain of this.  I have never heard anyone else having a similar sighting as this.  I don’t know why I have seen so many UFO’s after my first sighting.  I leave you with good news and bad news.  The good news is my father recorded the whole thing.  The bad news is he cannot find the dam VHS tape.  Whatever we saw, was very real.

White/metallic spheres circling each other above west Los Angeles;2001-01-13 13:00:00;1 min;White/metallic spheres circling each other above west Los Angeles I watched several (about 5-8) circular or spherical objects circle each other for about one minute. I don't know how long they were there before I noticed them, but the just seemed to disappear after about a minute. I don't know what altitude they were at, but I would guess it was a few thousand feet. Because I couldn't judge their altitude, I can't estimate how big they were. I was walking north on Westwood Blvd in Westwood, CA at the time and the objects were in the sky slightly to my right, so from my perspective they were to the northeast. The sky was clear. Most of the time the objects appeared to be white, but at one point one of them seemed to reflect light and appeared shiny for a moment, hence my description as metallic. There didn't seem to be a particular pattern in their movement, but they did circle around each other at times. ((NUFORC Note:  Could be advertising lights, possibly.

5-6 glowing orange spheres shoot across the Hollywood skyline Thanksgiving night 2001.;2001-11-22 23:45:00;3-5 minutes;5-6 glowing orange spheres shoot across the Hollywood skyline Thanksgiving night 2001. Standing on the roof of an apartment building at approximately midnight  on Thanksgiving 2001, we noticed a red/orange glowing sphere appear directly above us in the sky, maybe a thousand feet or so up.  The sphere didn't seem too large, we thought maybe it was some sort of weather balloon or small blimp.  It was stationary for maybe 10 seconds then it took off very quickly in a straight line heading south eventually dissappearing  into the horizon over downtown LA.  It moved in the direction the wind was blowing so we didn't think too much of it at first, though it did seem to move much faster & in a much more of a  straight line than would be possible by mere power of the wind.  Then about 30 seconds later, an identical one appeared & repeated the same pattern.  This continued for several minutes.  All in all, we saw 5-6 of these spheres do the exact same thing & in what seemed like a precise pattern & timing.  It was very curious indeed.  I didn't think to report it until now.  I just saw an online news blurb about UFO's in which there was a photo of an incident in Arizona about 5 years ago that looked somewhat similar to what my friend and I saw last year.  I was curious to see if anyone else in the Hollywood area saw the same thing.  We are very normal, responsible people and run our own small record label.  We have absolutely no reason (nor spare time) to lie about something liike this.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

I was looking up at sky and there it was a bright red object just hovering what seemed to be right next to mars. It was moving very slowly east to west then up and down sort scanning the area. This was very exciting so I called the local news station Fox 11 news and I got a hold of somebody at the breaking news desk. Well I told her I wanted to report something going on in the sky and before I could tell her anything she said to me Is this about the red glowing object in the sky? Apparently my friends and I were not the only ones seeing this. We continued to observe the object as it sort of cruised the sky and then it started to dim as if fading away, then it got bright red again.

Floating sphere outside LAX on Xmas.;2003-12-24 10:00:00;2 seconds;Floating sphere outside LAX on Xmas. As I was departing via commercial flight to Florida (American Airlines) I saw what appeared to be a whitish sphere floating at around 10,000 feet. We were still climbing to our cruise altitude (33,000 feet), at what I estimate to be 350 m.p.h.  The sphere had a very subtle hi-tech texture (i.e., plates, relief, and radii) vaguely resembling the Death Star from Star Wars. The UFO seemed to be static on the air, and due to our high speed -and its relative small size- we passed it at a distance of about a 100 yards in just a second, though it was long enough for me to realize that what I was looking at shouldn't be there.  I immediately checked with other passengers, and many saw something weird passing us too: but none wanted to go deeper into the subject. I believe I was the only one looking intently through the window before the sighting ocurred.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Clear, light blue skies, well lit still by sun, half-full moon in the sky over Hollywood / Los Angeles area.  My brother and I were sitting outside enjoying the evening.  Told him to check out the star and moon (which were right next to each other, the star was JUST outside the crescent, as if cradled) and he said that can't be a star, it must be a planet, it's so light out.  Then it started moving, we said, Oh, it's a plane.  But then when it came to a complete halt, we said, um.  ok.  do helicopters fly that high?.  Then we noticed another one going perpindicular, which seemed to appear out of nowhere (our eyes were PRETTY focused on the clear section of sky in our view).  Then we called our friends over who were setting up a tent in the backyard and we all watched for a while.  We then saw three more of them appear and fly in a standard V formation and then re-form at LIGHTNING speed (very very high up) into a few other odd formations and then dissapear.  These thing came into and out of view in a split second.  My friend checked them out with his binocolurs and said it appeared round with lights front and back.  Ok, i know, sounds like classic b.s.    Well, if they're planes, what in the flying hell are they doing such incredible stunts right over central Los Angeles for?    I tried to reach the FAA and Homeland Security at LAX and got an answering machine!  Lovely!  I spoke with someone (in the flurry of numbers i called) at a local airforce command station who said they had no flying going on in the area at the moment and ref'd me here!  Nice one guys.  Gathering enemy threat in the skies? Cool, ref it over to UFOCentral! Jesus.  Not putting this site down, it's just that i'd expect a little more from their response, let alone the FAA and Homeland Security.  After around 25 minutes more they were all gone.  They did not fly off north or south or east or west, they just vanished. I took pics but no luck, took video and got some of it - you can check it out here, but if i get too many downloads, i'll have to cut it.  I hope that someone will archive it and post it elsewhere if it's of use.  When you watch the clip, at 4 seconds into it you'll see a white dot in the top left quarter of the screen (you'll see the unfocused power lines running diagonally, follow the wires to find the white dot).  You'll see it, over the span of one second of film, it moves to the left across the power lines farther left and upwards.  (I'm not saying the craft moved that fast, it was my camera motion that moved quickly).  Anyway, admittadly, the film proves nada, only that we thought we were seeing some very very wacky stuff that none of us (4 of us in our thirties and 2 children) can explain.

Small metallic copper object 1-2 mi. above ground traveling w/sw-e/ne (viewed from L.A.-bound 757);2008-09-16 18:30:00;2-3 sec.;Small metallic copper object 1-2 mi. above ground traveling w/sw-e/ne (viewed from L.A.-bound 757) Last night (September 16, 2008), I was flying on Northwest Flight #303 from Minneapolis to Los Angeles, seated in a window seat in the left rear of the Boeing 757. The atmospheric condition was partly cloudy. We had already started our descent and were probably about 3-4 miles up.  At approximately 18:30, about 30 minutes before we landed at LAX, I spotted a spherical metallic-looking object moving at approximately 150-400 mph either west-east or sw-ne about 1-2 miles above the ground, moving the exact opposite direction of the plane about a half mile to the south. It was about the size of a golf ball from about 100 yards.  ((sic--100 feet.)   I first spotted it at about 11:00 (direction, not time), and I was only able to view it for about 2-3 seconds before it disappeared from view. I didn’t notice any lights on the object, but it was reflecting the sun which was low in the wsw which caused it to appear bright copper. I didn’t notice any other physical features such as wings or a tail, and it didn’t leave an exhaust stream.  I’m 52 years old, and have been an amateur astronomer since I was a young child.  In my life, I’ve seen just about anything you can think of in the sky, but never before last night have I ever seen an object that I could not identify.  I’ve probably made over 40 cross-country flights, and am used to seeing planes and helicopters, but the object I saw last night didn’t resemble anything I’ve ever seen. Maybe it has a non-UFO explanation, but I decided to post the incident anyhow in hopes that someone else may have seen the object. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) This is a correction to my previous report submitted 09/17/08 at 14:17:09.  When I described the size of the object, it should have read:  It was about the size of a golf ball from about 100 feet.

Star/sphere like object moving back and forth.;2008-12-27 15:00:00;30 minutes;Star/sphere like object moving back and forth. Couple days after Xmas and a couple days before new years and my brother and I were trying out my moms new video camera my dad had got for her for Xmas. I think I was looking at the pine tree seen in the video first, then i noticed what i thought was a balloon. Didnt think much of it at first till i noticed it wasnt moving with the air how a balloon would typically do. I've seen balloons float before in the area because people usually have partys around holidays or on the weekends and they always float in a north east direction and these objects were and stayed in  a south east direction from where we were standing. Thats when i told my brother if he was seeing what Im seeing and I told him how it was weird how its kinda just sitting there. that when i started recording and i noticed it was moving back and forth, told my brother and he noticed it too. We noticed it was moving back and forth because of the tree. Of course the tree is stationary and you can see in the video how the star/balloon UFO was moving back and forth. my brother ran inside to get the tripod kuz it was difficult to zoom and focus of the object, then we lost it. I continued to look for it up in the sky and found it again, I tryied recording it but it was too small to focus on. Then i noticed that there was another next to it and it seemed as if they were playing (they were moving close and away from each other). Seconds later I lost sight of them again and then noticed a third maybe twice as far or small as the previous and it simply blended into the blue sky.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

After asking them to look up, the clouds were blocking the area where I observed the object.  The object DID NOT SEEM TO MOVE, while I observed it.

Volley Ball Sized Light Orb passed through my glass window and into my apartment and I touched it and lost consciousness;2010-09-15 21:15:00;unknown;Volley Ball Sized Light Orb passed through my glass window and into my apartment and I touched it and lost consciousness This event occurred in mid-September 2010. Unfortunately I found the experience so shocking I denied its occurrence even to myself (I decided it had to be a dream or hallucination) until about 2 months ago when I found the courage to search light orb flew through my window on Google and was SHOCKED to discover many accounts of encounters with seemingly sentient orbs of light--often referred to as ball lightning. Then I found clips on youtube of people that had strikingly similar encounters--and I really got the chills hearing others echoing my own encounter (albeit I'm yet to really find anyone who got as close as I did to it). But hearing others recount stories so similar to this event that I had told myself didn't happen allowed me to accept that it likely really did happen. And reflection of how vividly I remember the so-called hallucination/dream also helped me to believe my own story. But due to this being something that occurred so long ago, that! I believe I was in denial of, some details aren't as vivid as others. I don't know the precise date or time of the event. Only that it was mid-September 2010 and after dark but early enough that I was awake in my home with the lights still on. I have some fuzzy memories of time that aren't as vivid as the memories of the experience itself that I feel apprehensive to commit 100% to in the way I can the actual events of my encounter.  With that out of the way, here's my detailed description of my encounter with a Volley Ball-sized orb of bright white light with a swirling cloud of light around it.  I was home alone in my 8th floor downtown Los Angeles loft--which looks out over Los Angeles Street, with very high ceilings and large glass windows that provide an expansive view from the edge of the high-rises. I was seated atop my bed, with the large windows to the right of me, watching a TV that was in front of and slightly to the left. Out of the corner of my right eye I saw something bright hovering slowly towards my apartment window. I recall not fixing my eyes on it bc for an instance I thought it was a trick of the light or some kind of optical illusion and if I refocused my eyes-it would be gone. But the object grew closer and I fixed my gaze on it (couldn't tell u if I paused what I was watching or muted it, or what it was--can't recall) and watched it come in kind of a low arc up and THROUGH my glass window.  At this point, what I believe is natural shock reaction was occurring. I was seeing something unlike anything I had ever seen--a light ball, as I described above, coming through my glass window (not shattering just passing through it) and slowly hovering into a corner between the window and a large pillar (it's an old building with pillar-like supports between 3 large windows) and slowly rising upwards. I remember experiencing feelings of shock, awe, confusion, terror--I remember a spiritual thought process kicking in, thinking maybe it was an Angel--or maybe death--you know like Go towards the light! I was thinking-Maybe this is that light. I was really scared. It slowly hovered towards the bed I was sitting atop--a large California kinf sized bed. It was closer to the end of the bed, not above me. I vividly remember slowly standing up to it, in a crouched position, king of rotating so I am standing atop the bed (remember this loft has like 18-20 ft ceilings) my bac! k basically now to the window it entered through, kind of crouched under it. I slowly reached towards it and as my hand got close to it (and honestly all of this--I could act it out for you, the standing the way it made me feel--this is the most vivid of all) I felt almost repelled by it--not physically, and nothing electrical, but it made me feel light headed and woozy. Like the closer I got to it I felt weakened and faint. I kind of hesitated a few times with my hand out like that and moved it forward into the light ball and lost consciousness. When I awoke I was indeed sideways atop my bed as if I had collapsed from the position I just recounted...but somehow I instantly told myself it was a dream/hallucination and never told anybody until my recent revelation.The ball of light was gone and left no trace. It was odorless, soundless-I don't recall the window having anything wrong or if I even checked it. I honestly instantly went into denial and didn't give it much thought. But the incident popped into my head occassionaly for years and left me wondering.I have no history of any kind of hallucinations before or after that event. I have some colorful dreams but nothing as vivid as this--this was a memory of a trauma IMO--not a dream or hallucination.  I don't know if touching this did any damage to me or what the light ball was or why it was in my home and how it is able to enter with impunity. It leaves many questions and concerns now that I accept what happens--but it feels like trying to solve a case way too late after it occurred. From November 2010 I had health problems that I thought were induced by some poor dietary choices (a raw vegan diet for an athletic 25 year old  really was too hard on me)but have had lifelong pains and physical issues ever since that have never been fully explained to me and I can't help but now question if touching whatever I touched could correlate in some way. I also reported this to MUFON this week and I just wish I could be provided some resources to tell me what to do after realizing this happened.  I have no idea what this or other light ball entities are. I can say it appeared to me to look very much like illustrations of atoms--in fact what lead me to look into this recently was my recent interest in quantum physics and seeing various illustrations of what an atom looks like--they look like and reminded me of the light ball I saw. It was as if the bright light in the middle is a nucleus with a whirling electron cloud of light around it.  I don't know if this is from the Earth, the sky, another planet, another dimension, another time. But I do know it happened.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Multiple flying objects seen in daylight, hovering over Los Angeles;2010-11-01 11:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple flying objects seen in daylight, hovering over Los Angeles We were heading home, going northbound on 1-5 from Los Angeles.  My husband was driving when I noticed a flash in the sky, almost like the reflection off of a mirror.  I didnt think much of it, but I kept seeing this flash from the corner of my eye. When I focused on it, I noticed it was an object that was just hovering in the sky, almost like a star... it would flash, then kind of blend in with the sky momentarily to where it almost looked like it dissappeared but you could still faintly see the outline of it, then it would reappear again.  Several more appeared, we counted a total of 5.  They were just hovering, pretty high up.  At one point they changed formation into a triangle, then they got so close together I thought they had merged into one. They were changing formation but not really going anywhere. It looked like they were changing color, from light green to silver, and then transparent again. We watched it for about 5-10 minutes until we got too far! for our eyes to see them anymore. My sister and I both got some footage of it using our digital cameras on full zoom, not very good footage but if you watch it frame by frame on the video you can see the objects appear and move around.  My sister only took about 5 seconds of footage because she didnt think she caught them on video, but on her video, you can actually see what looks like a transparent object fly by, flanked by the smaller shiny objects that we saw... pretty cool;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Three white spherical objects flying over Hollywood, CA.;2012-12-21 12:00:00;2 minutes;Three white spherical objects flying over Hollywood, CA. I saw two circular metal looking objects flying very fast from west to east over Hollywood, California.  As they flew into the distance, one of the objects made a sharp left turn like an L shape and disappeared.  The other object continued flying east and disappeared.  Seconds later, the one that flew east returned flying west with another object.  Then the one that made the sharp L-shaped turn returned to the other two and they began a dance like movement around each other.  As they did this dance, they appeared to be spheres that became invisible at certain angles.  When a plane with a contrail approached them, they disappeared.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
3 White Sphere over the City Of Angels.;2012-12-21 13:00:00;10 seconds;3 White Sphere over the City Of Angels. To whom it may concern, I have never thought about reporting any of the sightings I have encountered, but this is the 4 th time within 2 months, and I am sure they are alien flying objects. The reason I finally chose to report is, I wanted to be reassured of what I’ve seen and find out more info. I do believe in other worlds that are out of human reach. I will only report the latest sighting, which was today December 21, 2012, at approximately 1:00 P.M. Pacific Standard Time, of three bright white sphere shaped objects at 309 NW degrees down town L.A. As they hovered, they formed triangle shapes, and alignments, some were in straight lines, and then they would go around each other and form yet another triangle.  I have drawn a pattern of which they were forming. In the order they were formed and directions. Finally, a darker (Golden Black) bright object (can’t quite describe its shape) showed in the middle of the formed triangle, and that’s when they stopped hovering, formed one last straight line.  Darker object started vanishing, followed by the three white bright objects, until became way too far to be visible. Last but not least, it’s has always been a hypnotizing experience, where I can’t look away and my surroundings seem to have vanished.  Each of my sightings lasted about 6-10 seconds, yet it felt timeless. Thank you so much in advance.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
White orb slowly turns orange, and then white a few times.;2013-02-16 14:50:00;15-20 minutes;White orb slowly turns orange, and then white a few times. I was walking down Santa Monica Blvd towards Century City when I noticed a white dot in the sky traveling with a fair amount of speed, in a south west direction.  It was obviously not an airplane and my thought was it was probably a large white balloon.   I took out a pair of binoculars I had with me to get a better look at it.  Balloons typically have strings attached and rock a bit due to being heavier at the bottom but this did not.  It just appeared to be a white orb....at first. The object then seemed to stop moving west and seemed to begin to ascend a bit, then remaining suspended in the same location for about 10-15 minutes.  During this time it would occasionally slowly change from white to glowing orange, and back.  It did this two or three times.  It then began to move back in the direction from which it came, and then towards me.  I believe at this point it was higher than it had initially been.  It changed to orange one more time, and back to white, and then I lost track of it after I put the binoculars down to rest my arms. I don't believe this was a balloon as it did not exhibit a string or characteristic rocking.  I believe the orange coloring was emitted light rather than reflected light, because the sun was not low enough in the sky to cause an orange reflection, the change from white to orange to white occurred slower than expected if it were an object turning such to reflect light, and when objects in the sky reflect light, the intensity usually increases to a bright point quickly, and then decreases quickly.  This object did none of these things. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Reflective orbs flying back and forth and making formations in southern sky seen from Los Angeles, CA.;2013-08-06 15:23:00;30 seconds;Reflective orbs flying back and forth and making formations in southern sky seen from Los Angeles CA I work in Santa Monica CA and was on my way home at 3:23 pm.  It was a cloudless day and sunny.  I was just getting on the 105 freeway going east still in the city of Los Angeles.  At that time of day the traffic is very slow so I was driving under 5 miles an hour, creeping slowly and had just about reached the crest of the fly-over when I looked up into the southern sky.   At first I thought it was several Mylar balloons flying extremely high in the sky.  Then the reflective orbs started appearing and reappearing randomly.  There were maybe six or eight and they would form a line, a v shape and fly back and forth vertically and horizontally.   It was then that I realized that balloons can't make formations or fly in a straight line back and forth or disappear and reappear.  I knew I was witnessing UFOs and was thrilled.  I looked around at other cars beside me and no one seemed to be seeing what I was seeing. It lasted perhaps thirty seconds.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Dark Gray Metallic Sphere Flying at Constant Speed across LA;2014-11-30 15:30:00;2-3 minutes;Dark Gray Metallic Sphere Flying at Constant Speed across LA I only just found this site, hence my very late posting, and also my best guesstimate of the date in late November 2014 that the event occurred. My fiancé and I saw a craft on a perfect sunny and clear Sunday afternoon that we have failed to find any information on it, and wonder if you can help give us an understanding as to what it was. The craft was a flat metallic grey sphere about thiry-five to forty feet in diameter.  It appeared to be unpolished titanium, had no windows, no lights, and was completely silent.  It traveled at a constant speed, about the speed of a fast moving Bell Jet Ranger, which we see a lot of here, so approximately 140-150mph,  When I first saw it I thought it was a helicopter but I couldn't see any blades.  I pointed it out to my other half, and we looked at it as it came right towards us.  It was flying at no more than 1500ft, and at a constant speed, passing by in total silence at around 150mph.  At its closest it was no more than 1/8-1/4 mile from us.  It was a perfect blue sky LA afternoon with low afternoon autumn sun perfectly illuminating it, so it was absolutely clear what it was. We live on the Santa Monica Mountains with a very open 180º panoramic view out over the entire LA Basin, and this craft quite literally flew along Sunset Boulevard.  For days after the event we searched the internet to see if there were any other reports of it, but found nothing. What neither of us can understand is how a craft can fly through such a densely populated area and be completely unreported.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Shiny, reflective, chrome-like sphere sighted in the flight-path over LAX.;2018-03-11 14:30:00;1 minute;Shiny, reflective, chrome-like sphere sighted in the flight-path over LAX. Landing at LAX approaching from the west coming in from the Pacific Ocean.  Coming down through patchy cloud-cover while descending towards LAX, and over the city itself, there was a shiny, reflective, chrome-like sphere visible in between the clouds.  It was not concealed by cloud-cover, it was in the open air between the clouds.  It had some sort of appendage hanging from the bottom of it that made me think that it looked like a woman's shiny bauble earring, almost.   Cannot recall exactly what was appended underneath but the object had a main, large, spherical, shiny body and then a second component below it.  It was not nylon or a tether hanging from it I don't think it was a weather balloon.   We flew by it so fast that I did not take a photo of it and it struck me as incredibly odd, and very dangerous, considering that it was directly in the flight path to LAX, and at the same altitude as the 777 that we were in.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Metallic sphere over Los Angeles.;2019-05-24 16:30:00;2-3 seconds;Metallic sphere over Los Angeles. Sitting on the left side of AA FLIGHT 6031 into Los Angeles from San Jose.  Late afternoon arrival, clear day.  On approach at approximately 2,000 feet bearing east toward downtown, approximately 1-2 minutes before right turn into final.   Observed a small, metallic sphere traveling in the opposite direction (west) at a very high rate of speed.  Distance, speed and size of craft not possible in the very short duration of observation.  Object appeared reflective.  Sighting was not discussed with any other crew members or passengers. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter I did not mention it to others on the aircraft and the date is accurate within a week or so.  I was actually familiar with the flight crew, as I take this fight many times a month but the cockpit door was closed as we disembarked so the opportunity didn’t exist to discuss.     I don’t want to get into the details of what I do for a living but I fly a lot, sometimes many times a week.  I’m very familiar with most types of aircraft, both civilian and military (and I’ve flow on over 25 types personally).  I’ve seen similar objects on two separate occasions over the last 15-20 years.  Both were metallic spheres, one was a metallic green and the other more red and they seemed to have a slight glow… and both, I recall, seemed disturbingly close to the aircraft.  Those, if I recall correctly, happened over the mid-west but it was many years ago.  I believe one was near DFW. The recent sighting was the first I’ve had in at least a decade.  The object just seemed to be metallic with no coloration.  But it was an extremely brief sighting. As I mentioned, the disturbing part to me is that these objects are flying, at high speed, well within safe commercial separation.  It’s hard to determine their actual size but maybe something akin to Sputnik.  They seem to have no visible means propulsion or ability to stay aloft (wing surface, stabilizers, etc) nor any other surface breaks, antenna, etc. I’ve always been reluctant to discuss but now that I’m on number three I feel compelled to figure it out.  I brought it up only once prior to a 777 pilot deadheading in a seat next to me but he wasn’t very eager to continue the line of conversation.  If they’re government controlled it’s amazing that such technology exists but, at the same time, seemingly dangerous practice.  Especially over such busy airspace as the Los Angeles Basin.
