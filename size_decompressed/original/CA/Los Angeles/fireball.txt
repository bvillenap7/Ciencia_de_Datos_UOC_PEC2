Fireball passing through outer atmosphere about sunset.;1979-01-15 17:00:00;30 seconds or less;Fireball passing through outer atmosphere about sunset. At about sunset I was doing something in my house when my next door neighbor began shouting Bob! Bob! Get out here right now, you have to see this!  I lagged in answering about five seconds and he repeated with great urgency.  I ran out just in time to see half the event remaining.  It was a very bright object passing through the outer atmosphere, at very high speed, going perhaps southeast to west.  Whatever it was had two sets of streamers coming off it, one was a series of superheated lines of atmosphere or perhaps particles, which streamers looked very much in configuration like the lines coming off a plastic badminton birdie.  The second was a SHOCK WAVE perhaps fifty miles in FRONT of the object, of super compressed air which also was forming streamers, but of a much larger diameter, like pushing a large flat serving bowl.  The intensity of the object did not diminish, and it passed right on through the atmosphere and out again, into space.  I checked the news and a few other sources but I never heard of anyone else seeing this object, which was either an off course spacecraft (which someone must have caught hell for), or simply a large meteor.  This was probably 1978 or 1979 winter, probably January.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

In full view.. above the high rise buildings in Downtown L.A. suddenly leaving a trail as if breaking up.. and then it completely disappeared as if it vaporized. About this time last week (Sunday, November 8).. as I was sitting on my balcony enjoying my pipe 'n quiet time.. that a most unusual event took place. (By the way.. it's good Black Cavendish tobacco.. not pot! I work as a Counselor for one of the comprehensive LAUSD high schools. And unlike Bill.. I truly never have inhaled! My brothers smoked enough for all of us.) Anyway.. I live in the heart of the city of Los Angeles with the high rise buildings framing my living room view in an exquiste panoramic style. Having lived in Downtown for several years, now.. I have grown accostumed to the several single and twin engine airplanes as well as police, News media.. and corporate helicopters that often circle round both day and night.. the several city blocks that make up Downtown. Suddenly.. and speeding through the night sky from a southern horizontal direction.. (I would say whizzing.. but it was absolutely noiseless.. there was no sound..) came a ball of fire.. approximately 2 stories high and perfectly round.. as I compared this irregular sight with the high rise buildings. This object was heading somewhat north (northeast). It definitely was NOT not a shooting star nor comet.. heading in even the slightest downward vertical direction. It was not the Moon. It was not birds. It wasn't even Superman. My first, startled.. and only impression was: Lord God?! thinking that it could have crashed into any of these buildings just as in any of those recent blockbuster movies. This fireball appeared no further than 3/4th of a mile away.. and traveled not much more than a mile from my home. The entire event was always visable. Perfectly framed by two tall buildings.. the event ended seconds later.. perhaps, directly above the Union Station (I was a MetroLink communter to Chatsworth for an entire year.. and am aware of nearby locations).  And though my estimation of height is terribly inaccurate.. I would guess.. it was the typical and same altitude that all small aircraft fly.. here in the Downtown area.  Within split seconds.. this enormously silent ball was leaving a skid mark in its wake.. before it fully vaporized and disappeared. It was moving with the silence and speed of a missle.. but there was no explosion. Well, I sat for perhaps twenty minutes to a half hour in amazement and complete disbelief as I struggled to reconstruct and understand the all too brief and all too unusual sight. In addition, I was hoping to see if some police helicopter or airplane would be in the air.. checking out the strange anomaly. Beyond that.. I saw nothing.. and heard nothing reported in the News this entire week.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
I saw 2 glowing balls move slowly across the sky at high altitude.;1999-01-10 08:30:00;3 mins.?;I saw 2 glowing balls move slowly across the sky at high altitude. In the morning around 8:30 AM of Jan 12, a Sunday, I saw a small glowing ball (gold? white?)move across the sky very high up in the air. Then another (popped on?)about 3 inches behind it. It was not an airplane because I did not see wings. It could have been a satellite though it was curious that there would be two satellites fairly close together. It could also have been balloons, but they seemed to move in a very straight line and I would think balloons would move more randomly. I saw them out my window and by the time I got up and got dressed to go outside I could not find them.

I saw this white light with a brilliant orange tail. I was in my truck just passing thru Running Springs Ca., which is at 5000ft level,  It appeared to be coming from the west over Los Angeles and traveling east. I pulled off the road and watched, thinking this could possibly an aircraft going down, then the orange tail disappeared and all I could see was a white light that was still traveling east and did not appear to be loosing altitude. Then it looked like the shots you see in the movies, of a craft or asteroid entering the atmosphere, there was a shield of light, fire or something in the front of this object and then it disappeared like it had burned up on entry. I would say the tail lasted over 2 minutes and the entire event close to 5-7 minutes. I immediately told the folks at work what I had seen, hoping someone had heard something on the radio,but no-one had. I realize this was fairly early in the AM but did you guys hear anything?;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Hello, I am a recent engineering graduate from USC. I  live near University of Southern California (USC).  I  witnessed a very strange ;2002-03-15 18:25:00;4 MIN;((NUFORC Note:  Report of missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  PD)) Hello, I am a recent engineering graduate from USC. I  live near University of Southern California (USC).  I  witnessed a very strange object today on the skies of Los Angeles on the west horizon. It was a very bright object, a intensely and brightly glowing object, moving at nearly at the speed of fast low flying airplane. It was moving in an zig zag pattern and left a long trail(zig zag). This object suddenly disappeared in a fraction of second as if it dissolved into skies. This event took place, I mean I saw it at 6.25 pm 15th March 2002 for nearly 30 sec,it may have been visible for more time. I am sure it was not a air plane, or a missile or weather balloon or meteor, because all of this make a straight smoke trail and this object made zigzag trail. Other thing  which suggested that it was an unusual object was the way this object disappeared in a fraction of second. The trails of this object could be seen clearly till 6.55 pm, till it became too dark. This object was moving from North- north-west towards south and the trail could be seen starting from same directions. Other details: 1: Though it is difficult for me to tell you the exact altitude but I can explain you in relative terms. The point at which the object vanished from the skies (6.25PM), I could see the moon nearby rising at the same point (6.40PM). Assuming that the object was directly above the sea shore, which is around 11miles straight from the place where I live and applying Pythagoras theorem the distance above the earth comes out to be 8.4 miles taking 35 degree angle and 6.9 miles above the  earth taking the angle as 30 degree. 2: Taking West as the horizon the Angle of inclination of the object must be around 35 degrees at the point where it diminished. 3: I was just adjacent to University of Southern California from where I graduated, at the gate  of my house. (Latitude = 34.020N Longitude = 118.29W approx.) I believe that the object must be above the pacific ocean or could be within the coast, but for sure not too much within the coast at the time it vanished. 4: At the time when I saw this object I was coming from the University, walking, after playing tennis there and when I saw this happen I was just infront of my house. 5: I didn't hear any kind of sound coming from the object. 6: The color of the object was like very bright halogen lamp of some 10,000 Watts seen from a distance of 20 meter (bright yellow), and in the same way it illuminated the large part of the surface surrounding it. 7: Yes there was one of my friend who witnessed the with me the things they happened.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

It was hovering at a height of 100 feet.   I was located 500 feet from the object which I calculate was 20 feet wide and 20 feet tall in the shape of a ball.   The craft also had a tail like a comet extending from the back of it that extended for about 100 feet and was made of the same white flame as the object.   Terrified, I ran to get my family and by the time I came back, the object was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

As my wife and I were driving North on the 405 Freeway near Panorama City (North of Los Angeles) we observed two objects that appeared to be Comets, very bright wite streaking fiery objects with gaseous trails making a sort of cone shap. They were at least 30 degrees apart in the sky at abot 60 degree elevation above the horizon.  One was directly in front of us and the other to our left.  They were very distracting and the one to our left seemed to be be moving North by Northeast at a high speed.  My initial thought was some kind of specialized rocket or aircraft but my wife insisted they ghad to be comets as they were giving off an immense amount of light energy for the distance they must have been.   We tracked them for at least 15 minutes then they both quickly disappeared from sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not understand how objects can be streaking, but still be in sight for an estimate 15 minutes.  We will attempt to obtain more information from the source.

We were sitting watching television and all of a sudden outside our living room window we saw two fireball shaped lights just beyond the roof of the house next door.  What I saw was the balls of light zig zag down into view and then zip out of sight heading northwest. The objects were big and close and the movement would have made me think it was a bird or something, if it wasn't so clearly a ball of light about the size of a streetlamp maybe or a large softball.  My husband saw the lights as bluish green and from his position in the room and he only saw them pass by the window.  We both jumped up but whe we got to the window there was nothing there.

I told one of my friends holding the camera to video tape it, to see if it was a plane or 727, we took a good look at the footage and there was no plane, my first description that it looked like a fireball.   It looks like a fireball, does that look like a plane to you?  No actually it doesn't, but I can't tell though?  I can the camera it is a 100 max, any more we wouldn't be able to see it. The object seemed to make an aura around the object, inside the fire ball there seemed to be a black metallic object. That we can barely make out, we had theories of a rocket. to missile, to a burning plane, to meteor, but none of those fit the description we just saw. All what we can tell it was descending at a sustained speed towards the Ocean. I showed the video to other people and there was no real answer. But that one comment was said on U tube, that it could be a Jumbo jet? I called the authorites about, they didn't care much about it until I I mentioned it was on video, then she was willing to transfer my call to security forces and I hung up.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Three lights or fireballs over Los Angeles, one was green, purple and blueish/white, at 7:40pm 1/8/07.  Exact incident in Singapore;2007-01-08 17:39:00;a couple of seconds;Three lights or fireballs over Los Angeles, one was green, purple and blueish/white, at 7:40pm 1/8/07.  Exact incident in Singapore I left work at 7:30pm on Monday and walked up Larchmont Blvd in Los Angeles.  When I got to the intersection of Larchmont and Melrose I noticed the sky lighting up towards the east.  One block east of me is Paramount Pictures and I figured it was filming (battle scenes for Transformers have been shot all over LA the past 2 months).  But the light got brighter and when I looked up I saw three things shooting down from the sky.  I clearly remember seeing green, purple, and a white/blueish color.  It got so bright I closed my eyes and it hit the floor.  Power on that street shut down (and just that street).  The floor shook and I remember hearing what sounded like an electrical voltage sound.  Besides Paramount Pictures, the area around me is mostly residential, including the section of Melrose that the light hit.  I saw several people walk outside to see what it was.  I also noticed that some cars stopped dead as if they ran out of power. About 2 minutes later I saw the LAPD arrive but they had no sirens on... just lights and they were don't anything.  The cop cars (3 of them) just stopped in the middle of the street and the police officers just stood on the street outside the main entrance of Paramount looking at eachother.  Cars continued to drive up and down the street.  My bus arrived about 5 minutes later and I saw the cops and leaving and several black cars showing up.  I also heard some kind of aircraft in the sky.  Once before I had seen a black helicopter in the sky that only let off a humming noise instead of the usual noise helicopters make.  Although I looked around I didn't see anything. When I got home (Wilshire & Western) I told my roomate that something wierd had happened and told him of what came out of the sky and he said he saw the same thing from outside our building.  He said he was texting someone from inside his truck and noticed lights.  He specifically recalled seeing 3 beams of light and seeing green.  He blow it off as electrical transformers blowing up (LA had a Santa Ana winds kicking up that day).  But from my angle and view, no electrical transformer could ever be has high as I saw those lights. Something we both noticed a short time later were hazmat trucks driving towards Paramount. Nothing on the news reported what I saw.  When I looked on the Craigslist, there was no talk to mention of what we saw.  And I know there were other witnesses because not only did I see people walk out of the restuarants and homes, but because it was in the middle of Los Angeles. The next day local news still had not reported anything, neither had the LA Times or yahoo. Today I found a story that on Sunday in Singapore people reported the exact same thing I saw.  3 beams of light or fire, most mentioned they saw green.  And the wierdest and scariest part that my roomate pointed out that I failed to look at, the Singapore newspaper story stated it happened at 7:40pm Sunday (they're a day behind Pacific time). I can't find any more information though.  Anyone else notice it?  Or can find a news report about it??;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

As soon as we thought we would hear it crash - it disappeared.   Did not look like a meteor - it was way too close in the sky.

Green fireball moving very low across the sky, throwing off sparks like fireworks.;2008-10-31 22:00:00;8 seconds;Green fireball moving very low across the sky, throwing off sparks like fireworks. Last night, a friend of mine and I took our sons out Trick or Treating here in Westchester, California, just north of Los Angeles International Airport.  We ended up at our local park’s Haunted House, and waited in the car for the kids to go through. We were parked facing North, and as we talked, I noticed a green flash of light streaking low across the sky. At first, I thought I was seeing fireworks, as the color was bright emerald green.   Then I realized it was ball shaped, and looked like a shooting star. Unlike a shooting star though, it seemed much lower in the sky, very close by, like fireworks would have been and it was  moving horizontally through the sky, rather than the falling arc one usually sees with a “shooting star.”  There seemed to be some sparks coming off of it also, as if it were burning up in the atmosphere.  Then it just disappeared. My friend did not see this, although she was facing in the same direction.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Orange pulsating light over the Farmers Market  in Los Angeles;2011-07-30 20:30:00;4 min;Orange pulsating light over the Farmers Market  in Los Angeles Noticed a pulsating orange thing (like a torch high up) in the sky moving in a Northwestern direction at a seemingly fast pace that slowed down considerably to a slow pace.  While it slowed down, the brightness of the object diminished till it came to a complete stop.   At that point the bright orange glow faded till it became a white dot that all of us saw.  It remained in the sky, stationary, for about two minutes till it continued to fade even more.  Then before it faded completely it started to move in a Northeasterly direction at a fast pace and disappeared behind a cloud (one of about three in the sky at that time). This sighting happened at the Farmers Market here in Los Angeles on a Saturday night.  It was busy and I know many people witnessed the event.

Disappears then reappears, a faint object in clouds moving west. Fiery red/orange orb (flare, but not because there was no tail) ascended in southern sky.  Disappeared into night sky, out beyond a star like a television dot of old when you turned it off. One witness said, It's still there in the clouds.  I'm not taking my eyes off it.  I went to get a telescope or binoculars.  When I came back out, witness said, There it is in the clouds. It stopped, sizzled, spiraled down in NWestern sky to a white light.  Then appeared in the night clouds like a wafting plastic bag caught in a drift in upper atmosphere, but it moved with purpose.  As it traveled west through the clouds, it looked dark and solid when it came into a little cloud clearing, it looked white like the color of the cloud but had shape.  When it moved into another thick patch of cloud it took on the denser color.  The shape at the top was bulbous.  It didn't jet, it floated but with purpose.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Multiple red/orange fireballs rising from the southeast horizon towards los angeles;2012-06-12 21:45:00;30 minutes;Multiple red/orange fireballs rising from the southeast horizon towards los angeles Our house is on a hillside in the Monterey Hills/ El Sereno neighborhoods of northeast Los Angeles.  We constantly see helicopters and air traffic going to and from LAX.   We see helicopters of all types – police, media, military, fire department. On Tuesday night, June 12, 2012, we sat in our kitchen and watched 20- 30 red/orange fireballs rise from the southeast move into the night sky over a 30 minute period.   They would come in groups of 2 -4.  As each group would rise, we saw helicopters fly back and forth between them.  The time was approximately 9:15-10 pm PST. My wife and both watched this for 30 -45 minutes.  We can’t stress enough that we never see these types of lights/craft in this part of the sky, and acting with these flight/movement characteristics.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Eight fireballs in the sky;2013-04-13 23:00:00;~t 6:00 minutes;Eight fireballs in the sky My son and I were outside sitting at our fireplace,  he was facing north when he said &quotthose planes? look like they're too close together&quot.   I turned around and we saw four orange-red fire balls at first flying across,  from west to east.  They were flying in a straight line, then two went up and the other two went beneath and they formed like a square.   As we continued to watch shortly after there were three more and they flew toward the other four and they were all just hovering. 	A helicopter came to investigate and as it got closer it started to rise toward the fireballs.  The first four at that time just dimmed out.  The helicopter turned toward the other three and went forward a bit.  The other three dimmed out as well.  Then we noticed another fireball about twice the size of the first seven coming from the west toward the helicopter.  At this time the helicopter turned to the east and left.   The larger fire ball slowed and began to move north bound and just zipped out of sight. 	About 3 min. later my son and I heard some loud pops and two flares were shot in the direction were all the activity had been happening.   At no time did these fireballs make any sound that we could hear.  We live in the path where commercial airplanes pass on a regular basis, on their way to the airport.  These were not airplanes!

Slow moveing golden fire balls stopped and hovered then glowed red and ascended out of sight slowly.;2013-06-03 22:00:00;15 minutes;slow moveing golden fire  balls stopped and hovered then glowed red and ascended out of sight slowly. The first golden flame came from the east to the north followed by the second one minute later .I did not see the first one go out of sight because the second one came on so fast that i gave my attention to that one solely .  This one seemed to get greater in size then go back to its normal shape all the time i am noticing a red glow from it also until it gets to were i am looking at it from the side and at this point it gets  entirely red and pulsating and looks to be completely stopped for a couple of minutes. slowly it ascends out of sight.The third fire ball comes at about four minutes later from the same direction and the same speed it seems to hover a little longer then up and away and no more sightings witnessed  after that.

Three red orange balls of light traveling low over the Santa Monica bay in Los Angeles and then ascending vertically and fading out of;2013-08-20 21:00:00;25 seconds;Three red orange balls of light traveling low over the Santa Monica bay in Los Angeles and then ascending vertically and fading out of I was traveling West in the main channel toward the Marina Del Rey harbor entrance at about 9pm when, I observed two red orange balls coming from the Point Dume area.  One was following the other and they appeared to be a few hundred feet off the water.  As they approached the shoreline, they made a sweeping turn skyward and ascended through the low cloud cover, straight up, and faded away.   A third red orange ball appeared to follow the exact same path about 5 seconds later.   There were no sounds associated with the objects.  Observing aircraft taking off from LAX only a few minutes later,  I have to also add that the light or energy emitted from these objects must have been high in intensity as lights from aircraft were only visible at close distances, given the light fog and low clouds.  I drove my Avon inflatable to the middle of the channel where one of the four story party boats was coming back in from the Harbor entrance area.  I was able to confirm with the! crew on the bridge that we all had in fact seen the same unexplainable lights.

Fire ball over major city.;2013-11-16 01:00:00;5 minutes;Fire ball over major city. A friend was outside when he alerted us to a fire ball in the sky to our south west.   We all went outside and watched a bright orange fire ball rise into the sky and slowly fade over the course of a few min.

Morphing fireball craft, Pico/Robertson area LA.;2013-12-02 20:00:00;5 minutes;Morphing fireball craft, Pico/Robertson area LA (This is the report I sent MUFON:  someone else saw and reported the same thing. I actually saw it on Dec. 2nd, not the 3rd.  Also, someone in the valley saw a very similar thing and posted the pics in Coast to Coast around the same time.  I will include the pics, as it is what we saw, but we saw it at night)  My wife and I were watching a noisy helicopter hovering two blocks away.  After turning away for a moment, I saw a flaming orange and red shape hovering roughlyidqay between is and the chopper.  The glowing flaming object was about 1/2 way between us and the helicopter, just above the tree line, now abot 3/4 of a city block from us. The bright object was amorphous, I could see flames rising from parts of it.  The shape was rather fluid, morphing a bit like mercury, changing shapes.  It it looked a Bit like a pair of wings to me at times, my wife saw a triangle as well, as did I, as it flowed smoothly into different forms of bright glowing orange red light. It was perfectly silent. It was not an airplane, drone, chopper, or toy hover craft or miniature chopper. It hovered, came towards us a bit, dipped down 20 degrees, swung due west, and eventually arced up steeply and went black or vanished abruptly. It was a clear night in the Pico - Robertson area of Los Angeles, near 8 pm The object was most dramatic and out of place, yet- no one seemed to notice oneoremlight in the sky.  As I pointed it out to my wife, it seemed to flow a bit brighter, and definately moved innocently a bit closer to us, or rather in our direction, and seemed to present a bit of a flourish In our direction as it made its exit, in a steep upward angle. It looked like firey glowing wings a good bit, which is meaningful to me personally also, my Wife is an Indian Tribal member, and her tribes name translates as Keepers of the Fire.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
3 fiery red lights flying in formation over east Los Angeles.;2013-12-30 21:30:00;5 minutes;3 fiery red lights flying in formation over east Los Angeles. I was sitting on the couch watching TV at my friend’s apartment when I saw some very strange red glowing lights going past the window.  The apartment is on the second floor with no other buildings obstructing the view from this window, so the object was possibly 1/2 mile to 1 mile away and quite high in the sky. I saw one light, then two, then a third in a triangle formation that was spread out length-wise.  I first thought it was a blimp, but that made no sense as there were no games going on that night in LA that I was aware of. I went to the window and the lights started to spread out more.  One went higher, the other went further away and the third one kept drifting ahead on its original course.  The one that rose higher came more toward us.  We turned off the TV and heard no helicopter rotors.  There were no spotlights either, which would be expected if they were choppers flying in formation like that.  There were no blinking lights... not police lights or anything news choppers would have had.  They were just glowing red dots in the sky that were moving slowly along. Two of them flew out of sight because trees closer to us obscured them.  But the third one just seemed to be there for a moment, then we looked away for a second to get a phone to try filming them and when we looked again, the 3rd object had vanished, even though it had been moving very slowly and was in the open sky with no trees to slip behind anywhere near it. Very strange indeed.  Neither of us had any logical explanation for what we’d seen.  We kept watch for a few minutes longer, but the objects never returned. No reports of this in the Los Angeles news today or on the internet anywhere.  Would love to know if anyone else saw this.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

A fireball above the southern horizon seen from the district of El Sereno in northeast Los Angeles.;2016-07-27 21:35:00;30 seconds;A fireball above the southern horizon seen from the district of El Sereno in northeast Los Angeles. While feeding the dogs in my backyard in the El Sereno district of Los Angeles I looked to the southern sky at approximately 9:35pm and saw a fireball which was yellow-orange in color. It left a luminous trail as it crossed the sky.  It traveled level about 30 degrees above the southern horizon for approximately 30 seconds from the time I first began observing it.   It then began to fall in altitude and break up into fragments as it reached the southeast horizon until it disappeared behind the trees and rooftops of the neighborhood.  This was most likely a meteor entering the atmosphere, but I decided to leave this report nonetheless.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405

Bright, orange/reddish light spotted moving over East LA;2020-04-29 21:25:00;10-15 seconds;Bright, orange/reddish light spotted moving over East LA Object moved in a straight line low in the atmosphere ( lower than a plane) at approx 50-55 degrees from approx sw to north. Rate of movement was consistent, it’s rate of movement was similar to the ISS when spotted from the ground, which is why I thought it was the ISS at first, yet it’s brightness, color, and lack of arc (it moved consistently in a straight line, parallel to the horizon) was inconsistent with how I have observed the ISS previously.  Single light, possibly  -8/-7 magnitude (urban area, no other stars currently visible)-reddish glow with a small halo possibly from atmospheric diffusion.  It faded slightly once before returning to full brightness again and then faded completely in a quick yet smooth manner.  I and the other witnesses heard no noise, either emitting from the object or before/after seeing the object.  (Fireworks go off frequently in my neighborhood and we heard no explosions before or after spotting the object).  It was almost lik! e an ember from a fire the way it flickered out, yet having seen many fireballs/shooting stars/meteor showers in my life, it moved like none of those and appeared very mechanical/intentional.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
