White shape changing orb in Los Angeles sky;2009-04-12 09:30:00;7 minutes;White shape changing orb in Los Angeles sky It happened on Easter Sunday.  My parents, who I live with, were at Mass and I stayed home doing my laundry and watching T.V in the garage.  I stepped outside for a minute to get some fresh air and to just cloud gaze and I noticed a white orb in the sky.  I could not tell how high it was or how big it was but I could tell it was white and appeared to be changing shape.  At first I thought it was a balloon or a plastic bag that had somehow got carried up by the wind to an unbelievable altitude but the object did not move.  It was unseasonably windy in L.A that day, which made the clouds coast by at a faster than normal speed but the object stayed stationary with out a sound.  After about 2 minutes of just staring at the object, I ran into the garage and took 2 pictures of the object and about 8 seconds of video. After the 8 seconds of video, my camera lost power for some reason.  The Photos were taken consecutively and the object appears to be in two different shapes.  The video is too grainy too see the object. After the camera lost power I went to the garage to put it back in the case. I went back outside and the object was gone.  I climbed on the roof of the garage to see if it had drifted or moved into the distance but there was no trace.  The timeframe of walking back into the garage had been about 9 seconds. I am baffled as to what the objects are but am very curious.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
Random sighting over W. Los Angeles at midnight;2011-03-11 00:00:00;3-5 seconds;Random sighting over W. Los Angeles at midnight At midnight precisely I witnessed what I initially believed to be a shooting star based off of the high trajectory and brightness.  I quickly realized the shiny, silver tear drop shape was in fact descending at a rapid rate over West Los Angeles.  I witnessed this event over the course of approximately 4-7 seconds on a balcony with a view of town standing beside my dog and when the object got within eye-sight after descending quickly I lost it or if you prefer, it vanished for lack of better explanation.  I wish this was a hoax, but it isn't and I'm just hoping it's a classic 'downed weather balloon'. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

9/27/2015  Los Angeles, CA.   three minutes  silver, verticle cigar shape with side panels  heading west;2015-09-27 18:00:00;2 minutes;9/27/2015  Los Angeles, Ca   three minutes  silver, verticle cigar shape with side panels  heading west 	UFO SIGHTING  			LOS ANGELES,  SEPTEMBER 27, 2015  Having been in the travel business and well traveled, I am fairly aware of flight patterns around Southern California airports. Observance occurred while sitting in the outdoor patio area of the LOS ANGELES MUSIC CENTER COMPLEX at approximately 6:00pm.  I was facing east and  observed two normal commercial flight patterns.  One was a quad-jet jumbo at a fairly high altitude, probably  enroute to Europe.  The others were  a series of aircraft doing their normal circle around downtown Los Angeles on their final approach to LAX.  I think these are somewhere about 6,000 feet or so. At one point I notice something in the sky near the “whispy” light cloud cover. My first reaction was to questions the flight pattern.  It was not a normal LAX approach nor was it an approach to Santa Monica Airport which normally occurs further north.  The object initially appeared to have alternating right and left side lights, somewhat similar to landing lights on commercial aircraft landing at night.   As it traveled further west, I realized that they were not lights but seemed to be the sun reflecting off of some sort of metallic panels on either side of a vertical  cigar-shaped object.  I brought the object to the attention of my friend.  His first reaction was that it was definitely not an airplane nor helicopter, as its appearance was not in coordination with either of these type of air vehicles. I continued to watch the object for about a minute or so. I was then distracted with the screaming of young children in the area.  I went back to look at the sky and the object was gone.  I continued to scan the sky, but never saw it again.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
