Bright light falling from sky into Ocean, close to earth.;2019-10-11 22:00:00;4 sec;Bright light falling from sky into Ocean, close to earth. Caught a bright light falling from the sky at around 22:00. It almost looked like a helicopter light, it was bright and traveling east to west. When all the sudden it literally fell from the sky. Couldn’t catch where it landed as it went behind a high rise towards the ocean. Possibly into the ocean? Near Santa Monica or south of there? It never reappeared so I can only assume it was heading towards the water. No sound. Couldn’t tell how close or far away, but there was cloud/smoke (from a wildfire farther north) coverage across all of Los Angeles and visibility was low. Could not see stars or moon due to it.;34.0448377217699;-118.305638872405
