huge ball of fire hanging in the sky;2006-10-11 19:00:00;1 -2 minutes;huge ball of fire hanging in the sky I was driving home from school, and as i came over the hill I saw what appeared to be a helicopter or small craft in flames hovering in the sky.  I stared at it awe struck, then it slowly and with no sound just fell out of the sky.  I thought if would set the whole hill on fire.  But that was it, then nothing.
