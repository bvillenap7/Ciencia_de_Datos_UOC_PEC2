As I was observing Mars last night, august 30th at 11pm, my attention was drawn to a fiery red light as bright as Mars, it was hovering a little distance to the right in the southern sky. It began to move upwards in a northerly direction towards my location. As it got closer I could distinguish that the light was composed of three smaller lights in a triangular configuratiion. The light object hovered there for about five seconds then it became reduced in size at high speed and disappeared and reappeared a few times until finally disapearing for good. When it turned off and on it seemed to be breathed in and out of space. I ran in the house to turn off the oven, I looked outside again towards the southern sky and there it was again in the same location as the first sighting, to the right of Mars! It started moving upwards in the same direction as the first time. It seemed at a higher altitude than the first one. When it got almost overhead, it hovered for a few seconds before moving in a doodle like line for about a minute before moving farther in a northwest direction and doing similar movements. It then moved northbound and closer before completely disappearing into space again.;34.0578418648014;-118.125550582746
It’s not the first time I see the light and it always heads NE.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the ISS??

I’m certain there’s life in space because we just can’t be the only life there is.  It could be possible that it’s the iss, but I don’t think I could see in space. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of ISS??
