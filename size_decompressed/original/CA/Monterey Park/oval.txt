A daylight sighting of a white object was seen by 30 witnesses over a 90 minute period.;2004-07-19 11:30:00;11 HOURS;A daylight sighting of a white object was seen by 30 witnesses over a 90 minute period. The first object was initially seen at 8:45 am. I saw it at 11:30 am. Over a time span of about 90 minutes, the object was witnessed by at least 30 people, including campus police officers, police cadets, teachers, staff and students of East Los Angeles College. One witness is a MUFON member. He told me to note that the oject was 265 degrees west. I would estimate the object's angular distance above the western horizon at 80 degrees. The object was seen through a single lens spy glass and through binoculars. My impression was that the object was a flat oval shape, reflective with a black coloration at the bottom that I took to be a shadow. It was parallel to the horizon, not moving. I phoned in a report to NUFORC at around 11:45 am. Shortly after, a second object was witnessed by about 10 people, including the police officers. The second object approached the first one, stopped, moved around a bit then  took off . One witness said the second object disappeared.Campus police returned at around 1:15 pm and found the object again. About 6 people, including myself, looked at the object again through binoculars. This time the the object appeared tear-drop shaped, white and at a 90 degree angle to the horizon. It's angular distance above the western horizon had decreased to about 50 degrees. I took a digital picture in which a tiny white dot can be seen when you zoom in. My co-worker who had the original sighting starting at 8:45 am, and who found the object again at 11:30 am, returned that evening and located the object a third time at around 7:30 pm. Now the object was about 50 degrees above the eastern horizon! I took several digital pictures. The object appears as a tiny white dot. It seemed to slowly drift north. My co-worker will follow up with a report about what he witnessed between 8:45 am and 9:30 am, which was even more bizarre than the group sighting!;34.0578418648014;-118.125550582746
