Dark, swift object in night sky appears twice, 1st time curves in movement, freezes, then vanishes  2nd time speeds across night sky;2009-06-27 21:20:00;About 30 seconds;Dark, swift object in night sky appears twice, 1st time curves in movement, freezes, then vanishes  2nd time speeds across night sky It was nighttime, I was staring out in the sky hearing fireworks that were going off miles away, as it is almost the time to celebrate this year's Fourth of July holiday. I see this dark and unlit object (UFO) appear twice out of nowhere within a duration of thirty seconds, much higher (and probably closer) than any of the small-looking fireworks that were going off miles away.  It is presently summertime and the sun goes down later on so either it was the remaining illumination from the sunset or the illumination from Los Angeles either way, this was a dark object with no lights, however there was still enough light in the nighttime sky to see this object, and I know that I did see something.  It was possibly circular in shape, however it traveled too fast and it appeared too dark to tell. The first time I saw this dark object (UFO), it curved in movement in the sky and then froze and went out of sight, and I shrugged it off as nothing at first. The second time, however, I see another similar dark object (or possibly the same one as the first time), and this time it flew across the sky and out of sight in about a second... which is when I feel stunned and realize that this was definitely something. No meteor or shooting star could ever curve and totally stop in the middle of the sky and disappear like that.... and no firework can ever travel miles and miles across the sky in less a second either, and neither a firework nor a meteor would appear totally dark as well, unless both are burned out or something.;34.0578418648014;-118.125550582746
