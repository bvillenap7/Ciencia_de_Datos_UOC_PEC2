It was a normal, fairly warm night.  My mother had just gone to bed and i was outside in my front yard, listening to some music coming from my room, waiting for some of my friends to arrive.   I was looking up at the stars as i tend to do to clear my head, making up constellations and watching for shooting stars, when all of a sudden i saw what appeared to be a star moving!  There was no trail of light, there were no flashing lights like there are on planes, it just looked like a star got bored and went for a walk across the sky!   It was going faster than any normal cargo plane I've seen at night, but slow enough for my eyes to easily keep up with it.  It was flying in a straight line, from left to right, no arc at all.   I continued to watch it until it suddenly vanished.  It didn't speed up or flash away, it just disappeared like a magic trick.   I even looked around to see if i could find any other planes in the sky, and when i did, the obvious plane was moving considerably slower than the object and you could see the flashing lights clearly.   I know it was not a plane, and i know it was not a shooting star. I honestly have no idea what exactly I was looking at, but I do believe it was a UFO.;37.1356999999999;-121.6502
