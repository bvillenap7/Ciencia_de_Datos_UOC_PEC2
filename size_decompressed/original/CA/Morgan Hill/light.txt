I was standing in front of my house at ((deleted)) Ct talking on the phone when I saw a light slowing moving above me.  I first thought it was a plane but then I noticed that there were no blinking lights and no sound. I then watched it move north in a semi-straight line for about a minute or two, then all of a sudden, it divided into about 3 lights (that's when I thought something weird was going on) then the 3 lights started circling, and then it shot another light  out of it like it was a weapong or something, and it disapeared a little bit away from it. That's when I ran inside to tell my family and when I came back out, it wqas gone. It was weirdest thing I've ever seen.;37.1356999999999;-121.6502
Stationary object off US 101, blinding lights flashing and then disappeared.;2005-01-30 20:15:00;2 minutes;Stationary object off US 101, blinding lights flashing and then disappeared. Sunday night approximately around 8:15PM while driving on US 101, myself and 50-100 cars abruptly stopped on the freeway. Off to the right of the freeway was an intensly bright white/yellow light. The light was so blinding that I held my hand up to shield my eyes while trying to figure out what the object we were seeing was. A police officer was also on the freeway, he was out of his car also staring at the object. The object did not appear to be moving, it was flashing its lights in a three on-off pattern. The object remained for about two minutes, flashed three more times and then was gone. Freeway traffic began to pick up once again and I did not see the object anymore.;37.1356999999999;-121.6502
A white bright star like object moving slowly in the 15 degrees above the horizen from Henry Co State Park!;2005-09-06 00:48:00;Approx. 60 sec.;A white bright star like object moving slowly in the 15 degrees above the horizen from Henry Co State Park! While photographing celestial objects with my telescope and astro-photography gear atop on Henry Co State Park at about over 3400 elevations, I noted this consistant bright white star like object, approximately -3 in magnitute, traveling slowly from East to North-East covering about about 15 degrees of the sky in about 45 second, very low in the horizen just about 10-20 degrees above the horizen and barely above the distant mountains as visible in the photograph.  Earlier that night before I head up there, I checked for any possible Irridium flashes or ISS (International Space Station) passes as well as other bright and visible satellites which could have been photographed throughout the night (Sep. 5-6, 2005).  There were no passes over California of the ISS or any other other known objects that night.   The brightest I have ever seen ISS was about -1 magnitute at the most and at it's highest in the sky!  This object was not ISS or any other known satelite for sure as it's orbit indicted that clearly, not to mention it was too bright to be ISS or any other Earth orbiting Satelites!  So the only thing I suspected was an aircraft flying towards me head on since there were no flashes and the lights were extremly bright!  However, after observing it's flight path for about 45 second, I realizing that it was not flying towards me. Therefore eliminating to be a normal aircraft as well!  No aircrafts has a bright white spot light on it's side as far as I know!   I have been doing astro-photography since 1986 and I am pretty much familiar with all known flying objects, aircrafs and space crafts in the sky.  I can quickly identify what sort of objects it is when I see one!  In this case, I was puzzled as it did not make any sense!  Luckily, I had my digital camera mounted as piggy-back on my telescope's counterweight bar and was ready to take sequences of tracked 30 seconds wide angle shots to be stacked later.  So I snapped a shot of the object.  The duration of the snapshot is 30 seconds so the star like object streaked a bright white light through it's flight path right below the constellation Auriga! Note the brightness of thte star Capella (Alpha Aur.) is about 0.1 magnitute! In the photo, the stars are being tracked for 30 seconds so the light from them has been accumilated for 30 seconds.   In contrast, the object was moving so the brightness of it is not accu milated like stars. Meaning it is much brighter than it appears in the photograph!  It was so bright that I was confused for a second there as it was the planet Venus (-4 mag.);37.1356999999999;-121.6502
1/6/14, 22:00, Morgan Hill, CA, sky lit up in a huge brilliant green light from the ground up, behind possibly several miles of hills.;2014-01-06 22:00:00;30 seconds;1/6/14, 22:00, Morgan Hill, CA, sky lit up in a huge brilliant green light from the ground up, behind possibly several miles of hills. On 101 Freeway heading North from Morgan Hill towards Gilroy, just before getting to Cochran Road, behind the hills the sky lit up in a huge brilliant green light from the ground up.  It had to have covered several miles as the light flashed from behind several of the hills.  It happened twice within 10 seconds of each time the flash of light happened.   I wish I had been able to take a video of it with my cell phone but did not catch it in time.;37.1356999999999;-121.6502
Bright light zig-zags across the sky very quickly, then slows down rapidly and begins to flash an intermittent red light.;2015-10-11 00:43:00;30 seconds to one minute;Bright light zig-zags across the sky very quickly, then slows down rapidly and begins to flash an intermittent red light. In the hills of east Morgan Hill, CA, My coworker and I were hanging outside of the wedding we were photographing.  My coworker saw a shooting star in the Southern skies.  I did not see the shooting star.  A minute or two later, a bright light came flying across the sky from the south heading north.  It was moving very quickly and it was zig-zagging.  Once the light passed us overhead, it slowed very rapidly almost to a stop. It continued to move to the north, but much slower and began to flash a red light intermittently, mimicking a commercial plane.  Within a minute, it was over the horizon and out of view.;37.1356999999999;-121.6502
