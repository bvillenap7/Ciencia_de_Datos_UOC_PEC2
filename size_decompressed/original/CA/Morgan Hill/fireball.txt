mysterious fire-streak across the mountains near Morgan Hill, CA.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a contrail may have been the cause.  PD));2007-11-07 17:30:00;1 to 2 minutes;mysterious fire-streak across the mountains near Morgan Hill, CA On a drive over Watsonville Rd this evening around 5:30 p.m. my friend and I witnessed a fire streak, red and orange colored going above the mountains. We could not see a plane, just the streak which looked like fire. It was a steady stream, went on for several minutes before it disappeared behind the mountains.  Did not seem to hover or fall, just streaked across the sky, rather slowly as we watched it for awhile. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a contrail may have been the cause.  PD));37.1356999999999;-121.6502

I saw a giant fireball streak from north to south in the western sky but it disappeared from my view behind some houses. I'm not sure what it was but it might have been an enormous meteorite only it was so, so, big I fully expected to hear a boom from an impact.
