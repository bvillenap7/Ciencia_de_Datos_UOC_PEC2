We witnessed about 12 black objects pass overhead at night.;1991-09-02 21:30:00;30 min;We witnessed about 12 black objects pass overhead at night. On the night of September 2, 1990 we noticed over a dozen such objects as they passed overhead in two seperate flight NW to SE tracks. Six different people saw these from a area south of San Jose CA. I have seen bats, owls and light air craft in the skys with out lights, but never anything like this No lights, no sound. With field glasses a roundish shape could be made out for the front of the crafts.  It was hard to say how high they were but the sparce local clound cover was reported to be at 3,000 feet at the time and the object were well below that. These object passed over, one at a time a speed similar to a low fling light aircraft over a period of about 30 min. Two other things were noted durring this period. 1) the normaly busy air trafic in our skys was noexistant. 2) The object stopped going over at about the same time the full moon came up. I spend a lot of time under the night sky with my telescope but I have never seen anything like this before or sense. Has anyone else seen this type of dark objects?;37.1356999999999;-121.6502
