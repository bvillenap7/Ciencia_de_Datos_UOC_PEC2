A rather strange noise caught my attention as I was working in my yard.  I had a day off from work and I decided to work on our shed.  We appear to be in the flight path for the IFR approach into San Jose, CA International Airport, so I hear airplanes go over all the time.  We have a smaller airport very close and these smaller airplanes will fly over the house.  All of these flights appear to be at least 2,000 to 8,000 ft AGL.  As the strange noise became more evident I looked up and saw a long, thin, silver cigar looking object moving fast from south to north.  It appeared that it was using the same direction that the larger jets use for the approach into SJC.  I noticed a greenish plum of smoke coming from the end of the object.  The object moved quickly and was only in my sights for approximately five seconds.  The noise was like a faint blowing sound.  The object was just faint enough to be seen and there were no clouds in the sky that day.  ! It was a beautiful day.  As a 5k plus hour pilot I have seen strange things before lightning coming out of the top of clouds, green objects shooting down toward the earth (meteorites), jets traveling very fast toward me and passing me within less than a mile.  I am very sure what I saw.  I have no need to make crazy stuff up.....I did find that someone else had seen something similar to what I saw but am not aware of his location.  It was on the internet.   Thank you for your website.;37.1356999999999;-121.6502
