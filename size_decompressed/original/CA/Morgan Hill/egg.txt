Object floating in sky immediately goes warp speed and stops!  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));2012-02-19 19:00:00;1 hour;Object floating in sky immediately goes warp speed and stops! We were driving north on Monterey Road.  Lots of businesses.. streetlights but this caught our eye.  To the left (west) we saw a very bright light floating in the sky.  It hovered like it was not moving at all.  It was bigger and brighter than the closest star.. it alwmost appeared to be glowing.   We attempted to photograph it with our cell phones but it would not appear in their view finders, however, we managed to videotape it for about 20 seconds when suddenly, it  sped towards us at an extremely alarming speed.  We gestimated that it was originally about 100 miles from us, however , in less than half a second, it was about  50-60 miles closer to us.. just like that.   We pulled over to watch it as it appeared to suddenly move faster and it apeared to change colors.. the hue would flash a faint green or purple. After stopping to eat to pick up food and go home, we checked outside our door a few tiems.. it still seemed to hover but was further away,, say 100-200 miles at that point.. like a pin drop in the sky.  We all agreed that this was no plane, no helicopter, nothing we had ever seen nor experienced before. FYI:  Right before we saw this objest, my car stopped for no apparent reason, just stopped while I was driving. We parked, went into our friends house.. she stated that her friend had left late because her car battery had died and she needed a new one. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus, we suspect.  The apparent movement may have been caused by the zoom function of the camera lens.  PD));37.1356999999999;-121.6502
