The distance was great as you could not see this with the naked eye but it had me interested for one reason.   Even though at a great distance with each strobe flash it would be quite a distance away from the previous one and then not at predictable areas that you would normally guess to be its next location, sometimes it would increase that space and sometimes it would appear to just move a hair in distance.   The thing that really got me watching intensly was when it started to move up and down then left to right and then the opposite direction.  I tried to come up with some sort of explanation such as since it was so far away that it could be that it appeared to be moving all around but just traveling away from me and changing altitude and direction.   I have lived around many military bases and am familiar with air craft and such.  I have never seen anything that could do the things that this flashing light did!    Who knows!  I just never understood why U.F.O's would feel the need to have lights on their craft anyway-Think about that one!;37.1356999999999;-121.6502
