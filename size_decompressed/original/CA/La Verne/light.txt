Orange stationary light which three other orange lights dropped from.;1999-06-13 23:22:00;3 minutes;Orange stationary light which three other orange lights dropped from. As I stepped out onto my balcony at 11:22pm I lit a cigarette and looked up at the incoming jets to LAX. I noticed an orange looking light that I assumed was also an incoming jet, but it did not move. As I watched this light I could see the jets were actually flying under this light. Then I noticed another orange light drop straight down from this statioary light. The second light to fall from this light had a trail behind it. I called my girlfriend to come outside and see this light show, before see was able to get outside a third light fell from the light. When my girlfriend did arrive we watched the light flicker off then on, then fade out and on, and finally it went completely out.;34.1203;-117.7703
Descending white light flattened to a line of light;2005-07-09 22:00:00;1 minute;Descending white light flattened to a line of light My girlfriend and I were driving East on the 210, when we saw what initially appeared to be a plane on the glide path to Ontario airport.  It was a descending white light.  What caught our attention, however, was that the shape of the light changed as it descended, flattening out into a horizontal line of light.  As we drove down a depression in the freeway, we lost sight of it, but I caught one more glimpse of it after coming up the other side.   Although I only saw it momentarily, it appeared as if there were two white lines of light, one on top of the other (like an equal sign).  I then lost sight of the lights.  I noticed there was another report from this night in Rialto, and I'm sure that many people must have seen the same thing, as there were many cars around us on the freeway.;34.1203;-117.7703
