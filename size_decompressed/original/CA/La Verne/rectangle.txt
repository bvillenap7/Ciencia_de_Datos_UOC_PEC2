Black rectangular object hovering over La Verne Ca. north of 210 fwy;2009-06-03 09:22:00;2 minutes;Black rectangular object hovering over La Verne Ca. north of 210 fwy 06/03/09 La Verne Ca. 9:24 Am I was driving west bound on the 210 fwy at aproximately 9:22 am driving 70 mph in 2nd lane from the left.I noticed in the righthand corner of my field of view  through my windshield a large black rectangular object hovering perpindcular to the ground, thinking it was a stealth bomber or other type of military aircraft.  The closer my vehicle got to the area I realised it wasn't an airplane, the object was several hundred feet in the air and stationary,the coloring was flat black it looked 2 dimentional and very hard to focus on it's exact contours.  I slowed down and bent forward to see this thing as I got closer and began passing the area it was hovering traffic was slowing down to get a look as other motorists saw the object also, it still hovered several hundred feet above the foothills I'm not sure what this thing was, but I got the chills as i looked at it.  I don't really beleive in aliens or the paranormal but what ever this object was it was not an airplane or balloon.;34.1203;-117.7703
