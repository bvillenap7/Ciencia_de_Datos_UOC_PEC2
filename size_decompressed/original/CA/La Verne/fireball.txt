I was driving us on Interstate freeway 10, due west, at the junction of the 210 freeway, when I saw what looked like a flare, except that it was larger than anything I had seen before. It was a large circular object encased in fire, with a tail extending behind. It moved slowly and as it crossed in front of us, it started to extinguish its fire and afterwards I was able to see the outline of a small craft with a singular blue/green light. My friend and I were returning from a UFO conference in Laughlin Nevada and at 2:30am we saw what looked like a flare or shooting star like object, traveling due south as we traveled west. We watched with amazement as this object just took its time, flying approx. at an altitude of 6000 feet. It was shaped like a ice cream cone, but flying on it side, with a stout tail and all blazing at the same color temperature of rich fire gold. As it crossed right in front of us it started to extinguish its flames, in much the same way your furnace turns off, showing hues of blue, green, red and gold. It seem to crackle, I didn't hear anything but the way the fire went out it was uneven and there seemed to be sparks. When it was just to our left, it was completely extinguished and I saw the outline of a craft, which appeared small and circular, with a single blue/green light. It continued to move very slowly and we then lost visual contact with it due to our direction of  travel. The whole event was approx. 2 minutes long.;34.1203;-117.7703
