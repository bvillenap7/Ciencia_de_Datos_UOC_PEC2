BRIGHT BLUE RECTANGLE FLYING LOW AND QUICK FROM NORTH TO SOUTH.;2000-01-02 21:00:00;2 SECONDS;BRIGHT BLUE RECTANGLE FLYING LOW AND QUICK FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. I live in a second floor apartment.I stood up from my couch, and as I crossed the room, out of the corner of my eye,I caught a bright blue rectangle flying quick and low from North to South. This was directly perpendicular to tonight's approach for Burbank Airport. At least it was at that hour of around 21:00. My view lasted only a second, two maximum, but I could tell that it seemed to be descending because I saw it at the roofline of another two story building about forty yards to the west of mine and the object disappeared behind it.;34.1449172727272;-118.388759090909
