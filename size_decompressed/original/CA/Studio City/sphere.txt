Blueish sphere with lights appeared in multiple photographs;2019-09-16 16:51:00;1 minute;Blueish sphere with lights appeared in multiple photographs On September 16, 2019, I was hiking in Fryman Canyon at Wilacre Park in the Santa Monica Mountains in Studio City, California.  It was late afternoon and the day was overcast.  There were some beautiful clouds.  I decided to take pictures of the clouds from the top of the mountain.  I did not see anything with my naked eye.  However, I snapped three photographs in succession.  The first photograph did not display any abnormalities.  The second and third photographs showed a blue dot.  When the blue dot is enlarged, a clearly visible round object is seen.  It appears there are several light sources or reflections coming off of the blueish object.;34.1449172727272;-118.388759090909
