Our first UFO sighting together;2002-08-10 22:00:00;>5 minutes;Our first UFO sighting together We saw two UFO's as we were driving North on Cold Water Canyon. They appeared to be at a relatively high altitude and were VERY close together, but far enough apart to tell that they were not a single object. They were hovering there, and we were watching as we were driving. They simultaneously turned at such an angle that made the light reflect back to us... It was SO bright. It was obvious to us that they were silvery metallic colored saucer shaped things. A few seconds later they turned back to their original position. Then we drove by a tree and they instantly dissappeared. We parked on the side of the road to look for them in the sky, but nothing was there. It was a perfectly clear day... no clouds or any thing. They just dissappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.1449172727272;-118.388759090909

Bright green lights hover over Los Angeles then back down to earth.;2012-11-03 19:50:00;10 seconds;Bright green lights hover over Los Angeles then back down to earth. It was flat and round with 3 bright green lights with a red light behind the green lights.  It went straight up then just stopped suddenly and hovered for about 3 seconds then slowly ascended back down to earth out of our view.  It WASN'T a helicopter or anything either of us had ever seen.  It was flat, like a round trash can lid.  Couldn't really tell the size cause of how far away it was but it looked fairly big cause of how bright the green lights were. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.
