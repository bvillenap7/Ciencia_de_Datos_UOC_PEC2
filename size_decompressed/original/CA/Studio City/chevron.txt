Stately progress of 25 or so round white lights in a chevron formation;2003-04-06 23:30:00;30 seconds;Stately progress of 25 or so round white lights in a chevron formation I was in the backyard and happened to look up at the sky toward an extremely tall palm tree in a neighbor's yard, three houses down the street. I saw what I ridiculously thought was a flock of geese flying in perfect formation but quickly realized that was not possible as it was night and the geese were actually white lights in a V or boomerang formation. There were maybe 25 lights in rows, like pave' diamonds. (Possibly four rows.) The lights were white, no color, not pulsing or twinkling and no beams coming from them. They did not seem to be part of a large object and there was no discernible structure behind them. There is a huge supermarket below this spot and a lot of reflected light coming up in the sky and I think I could have seen a solid structure around it. The lights did not move around but stayed in perfect formation, completely silent.  They appeared to be about 45 degrees above the horizon, just above this palm tree, which is about 80 feet tall. I can't estimate speed. It didn't zoom across the sky but made stately progress, possibly a little faster than an airplane. It then disappeared behind another very tall tree and I moved to be able to catch it as it would pass from behind the tree. But it disappeared and was not seen again. It did not move upward or laterally. It just disappeared. I am a 65 year-old college-educated male and have always been skeptical about these sightings.;34.1449172727272;-118.388759090909
