Large circular orangish yellowish fireball in the sky - Made no noise!;2012-11-28 22:00:00;2 minutes;Large circular orangish yellowish fireball in the sky - Made no noise! I need to start by saying my husband and I do not usually believe in stuff like this.  We are in our late 30s (me) and mid 40's (him) and have 2 children (both were sleeping).  After what we saw last night, I have to tell someone.   We were sitting outside in our yard.  My husband was facing me, so his back was to the outside and I was sitting so that all I could see was him and our yard.   All of the sudden a large glowing ball rose up from the trees.   I must have had a shocked look on my face because my husband asked me what was wrong, and I told him to turn around. It was big, it looked close (but not too close to be scary), and it was an organish - yellow color.  It looked as if it was glowing. It also looked like it was being propelled by a flame.  The oddest thing is that it made NO NOISE - that's what actually got my husband spooked, he kept saying over and over that something that big and close would have to make some type of noise.  It continued to rise, slowly, from the south and as it rose in the sky, it did get smaller.  It was a cloudy night and both my husband and I were shocked we could see it as clearly as we could.  It started to head north, and it disappeared into the sky the higher it got.  It moved pretty slowly the whole time.   We did video it on our iPhone, but it's not good footage, nothing that could be used.  All you see is a small dot and you hear my husband and I discussing how strange it looks and that it makes no noise. I'm so curious to know if anyone else saw it.  We leave near a major freeway, in a pretty populated city - someone else must have seen this!;34.1449172727272;-118.388759090909
