While walking south down the street from a friends house to my own, I noticed a bright blue light, round in shape in the sky, at about a 45 degree angle.  It was about twice the of a star.  It moved very slow for about 4 seconds since the time that I noticed it in the sky.   Suddenly it tripled its speed for about 1 and a half seconds, and covered about 3 times the distance it had already traveled from the time I started watching it.  It then slowed down instantly  to its original speed just before making a very sudden and Sharp movement straight up right before it just disappeared.  It traveled in a straight line before it moved up and disappeared.  Very bright, very blue in color, stood out from everything else in the night sky.   This object  left no trail behind it. It was a solid mass.  It did not strobe.   Its movement and change in speed and direction were very sharp, sudden, and precise.  I have been working with the military air wing for the last 7 years.  This object was flying, but not like any aircraft I have ever seen.   It was shocking.;32.8571;-116.9191
Orange circle of light above East County;2011-08-02 21:50:00;10 min;Orange circle of light above East County My husband and I saw a bright, orange light in the sky while on vacation back home in the East County area of San Diego.   At first I thought it was a very close planet, but I knew that I had never seen one in that position in the night sky.   We sat outside to watch it for approximately 10 minutes, until it faded and finally went out, still in the same place it had been the entire time.  It was as if a circle of orange light was beaming around the circular object, approximately 17,000 ft. in the sky.  It also had a small fire coming out of it at times, toward the end of the ten minutes.  I thought it could be a flare, which I've heard of but never witnessed, but the craft was stationary in the sky the entire time, and quite large and unusual.  It is not like any military or civilian aircraft either of us had ever seen.  Slowly the light on the craft began to lessen as it went around, and then it extinguished entirely.  There was no sound that we detected.  It! was approximately 20 miles from our location.;32.8571;-116.9191
Bright lights in early morning sky in eastern San Diego County.;2013-10-17 06:45:00;10 minutes;Bright lights in early morning sky in eastern San Diego County. I was driving my vehicle on 67 North towards the Mapleview exit at approximately 6:45 am on 10/17/13.  The sun had not risen above the horizon yet and the sky was getting light.   There are two mountains directly east of there about 50 miles away with a “valley” in between.  I saw a spot in the sky that was as bright as the sun but was only “aspirin” size in the sky. I didn't know what it was but knew it wasn't a star or plane as stars and planes are not that bright from that distance.  It was like a little piece of the sun in the early morning sky.  As I sat at the stoplight, I watched the light in the sky slowly move in a northerly direction by noticing how it moved with a stationary object, a tree, as my focal point.  Then all of a sudden a second and third light appeared. One of the lights was sort of elongated, almost like a shooting star with a tail but not.  It seemed kind of stationary, but I also got the feeling it was moving in a southerly direction. The third light was a little bigger than the first light and appeared like it was moving in a northerly direction.  As traffic started moving, I tried to keep watch.  The lights stayed for a few moments and then all of them disappeared.  As I continued up the hill on 67 North, I saw one of the lights had come back.  I then traveled too far to see it anymore and don’t know how long it stayed there. When I arrived at work in Poway, I watched the area periodically from a second story window, but the sun had risen by then and it was too bright.  I didn't see them again.  As I drove to work the following morning, I looked for the lights but they were not there. On 10/19/13, we went to dinner with our neighbors and I mentioned the incident to them.  My neighbor told me that on 10/17/13 she was stopped at the stoplight before getting on the freeway, and was giving some money to the panhandler standing there.  He told her that his wife had seen some bright lights in the eastern sky that morning.  From my neighbor’s description of the conversation, it was in the same direction and approximately the same time as the incident that I witnessed.;32.8571;-116.9191
