Flickering orange light (on fire?) moving across the sky possible debris stream;2003-10-18 21:00:00;5 minutes;Flickering orange light (on fire?) moving across the sky possible debris stream The time listed is a guess--it was about 15 minutes or so after Game 1 of the World Series had ended, and I was walking to my house with a friend. I was walking west and looking at nothing in particular in the sky when I saw a very small object--it was West-Southwest from me, by my guess--basically just a spot of orangish light in the sky. At first I thought it might be Mars, still visible to the naked eye (I had been following all the Mars news during September and making a point to look for it when outside at night), but then I realized the object seemed to be moving, and the light (roughly the color of fire) was flickering. I pointed it out to my friend, and we started watching it. As we watched over the course of several minutes, the object definitely moved in what appeared to be a southeastern direction, with its light flickering brighter and darker (not radically so, but we could see the difference). After a minute or two of watching, something smaller seemed to fall off the object, casting its own identical light. It appeared to fall straight down, and its light extinguished after just a few seconds. The primary object continued moving southeasterly, and after another minute or two, its light slowly faded to nothing, taking about a minute to do so. By the time it disappeared, it was located South-Southwest from our POV.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356

While driving my car in the mid afternoon of a day in the fall of 2004 on HYW 580 East-bound I had just crossed the San Rafael / Richmo;2004-10-10 15:00:00;3 minutes;While driving my car in the mid afternoon of a day in the fall of 2004 on HYW 580 East-bound I had just crossed the San Rafael / Richmond Bridge on my way from San Rafael to Berkeley CA. It was a clear day as far as I can recall--little or no cloud cover.  Something caught my eye which I first assumed was an airplane. It was slightly (5 degrees maybe?) to the right of straight ahead of the car and maybe a few degrees above horizontal, meaning that I could easily look at it with only a tiny eye movement from where my eyes would be normally while driving. I dont know how to estimate the distance because I dont know the size of the object but if it had been a commercial jet I would have guessed that it was several miles away. If I held my arm straight out this object would have looked the size of, or smaller than my thumbnail.  It was silver in color. The shape was indeterminate and I could not make out wings, a tail section or any features for that matter. What first caused me to be particularly curious about it was that it didnt seem to be moving. Everytime I glanced up at it it appeared to be in the same place. Had it been a plane it would have been slowly making its way across the sky but it didnt seem to be doing that.  So I continued to look at it for another minute or two while driving. Then, it began to change color, to darken to a grey and then a dark grey. This took about 3 seconds. Then, right as I was looking at it, I could no longer see it at all. It had kind of faded away quickly.  I pulled my car over and got out so that I could see clearly and there was nothing there but blue sky. I looked carefully around the area of the sky where I had seen it thinking that perhaps it had moved and I'd lost track of it but I could never re-aquire it.  Peter, I dont know why I didnt report this nearer the time it happened. Maybe it was just too vague an experience. Anyway, there it is. I hope it can add to your data.  If you have any questions I would be more than happy to answer them if I can. Thanks and I appreciate your work, ((name and telephone number deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Spotted at noon in Berkeley, Ca. as a light in Eastern sky, that stopped for a brief period, changed course and disappeared into the cl;2007-05-23 12:09:00;1 minute;Spotted at noon in Berkeley, Ca. as a light in Eastern sky, that stopped for a brief period, changed course and disappeared into the cl On May 23, 2007 at approx 12:09 PM., in Berkeley Ca... I was sitting in line to enter the Berkeley dumps, when I saw a plastic bag, that the wind had picked up and was floating in the air. With nothing else to do , I watched this bag floating for approx. one minute. This was in a Easternly direction. That's when I noticed a small metallic object quite a distance away, moving very fast. I have no idea of it's distance. At first I thought it was a satellite, because it seemed very small compaired to an airplane. It also appeared to be shinny, as if the sun was reflecting off of it. I watched it for about 15 seconds. Suddenly, it appeared to stop for about 5 seconds. That's when it really got my attention. Then it made a 35 degree right hand turn, and seemed to have slowed down. I reached for my digital camera and snapped a photo in the general area. This is photo # 440. I could not see the object in this first photo. When I looked again for the object, I lost sight of it. After about 30 seconds, I saw it again, and snapped another photo. Bingo...This would be photo # 441. That's when the dump guy signaled me to drive ahead onto the weigh-in scale, and my encounter was over. I have never witnessed any sightings before and have no idea, of what I saw.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Strange lights in the fog.;2013-07-03 01:30:00;10-15 seconds;strange lights in the fog I saw something quite strange on my way home this morning as I was driving (east on I-80/west on I-580) across the Berkeley flats.   There was a heavy marine layer and I saw what I thought at first was lightning coming through but quickly realized that the lights were rhythmic, one on the left then on the right, left, right and so on.   This happened about three times when I decided to grab my camera and film it.   As I was reaching for it, the light changed to a wide beam coming down in front of me with the source seemingly just out of sight in the clouds.  That happened twice I think and stopped just as I got my camera rolling so I don't think I got any of it on video.   I want to make clear that the source of the flashing lights appeared to be deeper into the marine layer than the beam of light which appeared to be just barely in it and that this layer started maybe 40 to 50 feet above the freeway.   All the lights were white.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
