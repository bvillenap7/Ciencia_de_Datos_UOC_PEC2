Points of light in the night sky in Berkeley followed years later by technological assault in San Jose.;1994-10-22 22:00:00;2 minutes;Points of light in the night sky in Berkeley followed years later by technological assault in San Jose. In October 1994, about the time of my twentieth birthday, I was in my room on Hillegasse street near the UC Berkeley campus.  I looked out of the window and saw a blip of light moving erratically in the sky.  In a moment, it went away.  I wished that it would reappear, and when I thought this it came back, this time moving in seemingly controlled, deliberate movements, as if it returned because I knew that I wanted it to return.  It seemed as if it had a message for me so I said, “Yes”, obeying it. The sighting seems to be related to an aberration that I heard on my radio, listening to BBC News as I fell asleep the night before I switched on the TV the morning of September 11, 2001 to see the horrors of the disasters in New York City and Washington DC. In November 2001, I was on the light rail in San Jose, when someone technologically assaulted me with a weapon in a pager case.  The weapon flashed rays in my eyes, and the person who assaulted me said, “I forgot”.  The rays reminded me of the acoustic aberration that I heard on the radio that night before the morning of September 11, 2001.   I now know that this person was being used by Fujisankei communications in New York City as a caricature to make money, and by the people of Fujisankei to pass for White people in what is left of South Africa’s apartheid. I have had some difficulty in expressions about seeing and hearing thunderstorms. I have witnessed a more constant point of light in the sky when I was in the Philippines in 2005 and upon my return to the United States in the years since that visit. After the change in the government of Iceland in February, I contacted the Consulates General of Great Britain and Chile in San Francisco, concerning Stonehenge and Easter Island in relation to the 1994 sighting.  Before reaching the consulates, I had only watched Fujisankei on Channel 26, but after my contact I found that Fujisankei was broadcasting on another channel, 60 digital 2, so I have the number two from the rongo-rongo tablets.

Two bright dots traveling silently in sunny blue sky, bay area California;2007-07-28 11:00:00;10 seconds;Two bright dots traveling silently in sunny blue sky, bay area California Walking home on a VERY clear and sunny day. Looked up and to the north east. Observed two very bright dots traveling south south west. They slowly came to a complete stop, hovered for about 3 seconds and then, in a fraction of a second, completely disappeared. All this was silent. My friend and I noticed it at the same time and when it vanished we both immediately looked at each other in disbelief. Very very strange.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Two star-like lights chasing each other at an incredible speed;2009-12-17 20:00:00;about 10 seconds;Two star-like lights chasing each other at an incredible speed I was in the parking lot of my office at Albany, CA, walking towards my car at around 8:00 PM on 12/17/2009.  I was facing north east when I saw two star-like objects just above the Berkeley hills.  I paused for awhile to look thinking that these maybe falling stars but the trajectory of the movements were about horizontal (zig-zagging smoothly) and one star-like object following (chasing?) the other.  These two star-like objects looked about 5-10x larger than an airplane in the night sky but moving much faster (maybe >> 20x ).  The objects were also much closer to the ground.  The objects were in the sky for about 5-10 seconds before disappearing in the horizon at a much faster speed.  The star-like objects' flickering “arms” were mostly white with a few red and blue.  I know how an airplane or helicopter looks like in the night sky and these star-like objects were very different.  These objects moved so much faster!;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
THREE BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS OVER OAKLAND AND A SHOOTING STAR.;2014-01-02 23:00:00;2 hours;THREE BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS OVER OAKLAND AND A SHOOTING STAR Three amber lights, the color of sodium vapor streetlights, were visible in the sky south by southeast Berkeley around 22:50.  They could have been between Oakland and Hayward, perhaps just east of Oakland Airport. My sister and I observed these lights from a porch in the North Berkeley hills from which we have a good view of the San Francisco Bay due west and to the south though trees block some of the vista. The bottom light was a few degrees above the landscape.  Above it was a larger and brighter light.  Then a third light west of that one forming a right sided triangle formation. We watched the lights pulsate for a few minutes and grow in intensity till they were perhaps twice as bright as the Oakland dockyard lights.  We then descended to the street as my sister was leaving.  From the sidewalk, I observed a white shooting star directly overhead moving northwest towards the North Bay. I returned back up to the porch and saw the light formation, which had dimmed. The third, westernmost light moved off.  With binoculars, I was able to make out additional details of the bigger of the two remaining lights.  The main amber light was central, below it was a small red light and on the upper right was a small green light.  All lights were constant with no pulsing.  There was no visible structure behind the lights viewed through the binoculars I set up a Canon 5d2 on a tripod.  I shot RAW stills and video for 2 hrs. with an 85mm and a 200mm lens.  The first pictures were taken around 23:10 pm and the last images around 00:45 am.  My mother observed the lights as well.  The lights were never as luminous during this period as when first spotted. There were a number of helicopters and airplanes moving about.  The lights generally hovered over the Oakland area but several times moved west over the San Francisco Bay, just south of the Oakland Bay Bridge.  It seemed as if the lights would move out over the bay when helicopter activity stepped up.  After perhaps a quarter of an hour they moved back. At this point, there was usually just one light.  The second would occasionally reappear, then either move off or fade away. One of the lights, when moving back towards Oakland continued east over the Oakland hills and disappeared from view.  The lights usually moved at a leisurely pace, but occasionally very quickly, relative to the planes and helicopters. At times, the lights would fade out and then fade up while over Oakland.  They would also periodically move vertically down, then back up again.  They always returned to the same approximate area around Oakland, at slightly different altitudes. Upon inspection of the RAW images, I have one object over the Bay with more discernible structure but I’m not sure if it is one of the lights or an airplane. You can make out a solid red light on the lower left end, perhaps a thin structure in the middle and a smaller green light at the upper right end. In the video, this light seems to flicker, appears as a tandem light and isn’t as bright as the Oakland lights so it might be a plane.  It seemed to me that the airplanes had a red light on one wing and a green light on the other. The problem was, the ‘UFO’ lights would occasionally move behind a tree in the foreground. Planes from SFO would also come from behind the trees, though on different trajectories and I would occasionally end up tracking those.  However, these made jet engine noise, had visible structures, etc. as they got closer. The vehicle in the RAW stills is moving northeast, then on the next clip, a video, it reverses and heads southwest.  Then a faster moving solid bright light from the north swoops past it and heads back to the Oakland area.  The vehicle in the RAW still continues south with blinking lights. The Oakland light moved off west again around 00:45am and disappeared behind a tree.  It did not seem to drift over the Bay again south of the Bay Bridge.  I packed up the gear and went inside. I observed the Oakland lights again the following day, Friday, 01/03/14 at approximately 18:30 along with a friend of mine as we were leaving. I saw it again at 22:00. I did not videotape this time.  They may have appeared on one more night. While driving south on the I5 freeway on Friday, 01/10/14, around 18:30, between Patterson and Newman, I observed another white shooting star moving southwest.  A piece of debris separated from the main body and trailed off before it dissipated. I have always had an interest in UFOs but have never observed anything unusual in the sky before.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Pulsating blue and red light over the Berkeley/ Oakland Hills.;2015-02-24 01:00:00;5+ minutes;Pulsating blue and red light over the Berkeley/ Oakland Hills. There is a light about 10,000 feet or more above the Berkeley Hills in Berkeley, CA.  The light appears stationary and pulsates a red and blue light.  My companion and I stared at it for at least 5 minutes and it was still there when I left- it doesn’t appear to be a star, since the blue and red colors are so pronounced.  It also may have slightly shifted from right to left and back again, which one can only detect because of the lights relative position to the buildings from our perspective. The light is located in what appears to be the northeastern sky from the downtown Berkeley area, just over the Berkeley or perhaps the Oakland hills area.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
About 10 points of white light, moving in a random pattern.;2015-11-04 09:30:00;5 minutes;Very high in the sky.  About 10 points of white light, moving in a random pattern, close together.  The swarm was moving in  a S.E. direction.  Higher than passing airliner.   They disappeared after observing them for about 5 minutes.  Poof!;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
