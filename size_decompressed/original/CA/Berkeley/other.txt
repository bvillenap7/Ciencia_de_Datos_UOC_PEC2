Two Bright star like UFOs follow eachother over Berkeley/Oakland CA and zoom off into space.;2009-11-25 17:50:00;2-3 min.;Two Bright star like UFOs follow eachother over Berkeley/Oakland CA and zoom off into space. I walked outside after a shower and looked up at the sky at the stars. I noticed 2 very bright stars. Brighter that most.  Then noticed they were moving slowly. I thought that they were satellites but satellites are not bright like the north star.  The speed increased and I noticed one was following the other clean across the sky toward the moon.  Then the trajectory changed to moving up toward the upper atmosphere and I could see them beginning to fade in brightness and size.  I could actually see the layers of atmosphere that the light was lighting up around them as they moved up out of the atmosphere until they vanished.  Was incredible. Shortly afterwards I may have heard large helicopter in the area. Not sure. Weird thing is I dreamed of this last week in a very vivid dream.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
