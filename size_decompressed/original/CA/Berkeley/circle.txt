Blue dotted lights forming a circle. Bright white aura in the center looked like electricity.;2010-05-02 20:40:00;5 minutes;Blue dotted lights forming a circle. Bright white aura in the center looked like electricity. I was riding my bike down the street heading north one evening.  The sun was setting and the sky was clear but, dark.  I was looking at a bright star when all of a sudden I  noticed a floating object.  At first it looked like a balloon the size of dime as it got closer the object looked oval like the body of a bird without wings.  When the object  floated over me it was the size of a silver dollar or larger that's when I realized it was a UFO.  There were two blue dots about an inch apart from each other forming a circle.  The blue light forming the circle would rotate in all directions.  It was so beautiful.  When the object would face me full circle the white light in the center would get brighter like electricity. I've never experienced anything like this ever before. It was breathtaking.  I couldn't get my eye's away from it.  This sighting has been an awakening moment for me.  I now know that we are being watched. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
