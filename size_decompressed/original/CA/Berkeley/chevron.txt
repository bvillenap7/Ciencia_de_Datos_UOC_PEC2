Dark, swift chevron-shaped craft with bright headlight over East Bay, CA;2007-03-16 23:00:00;12 minutes;Dark, swift chevron-shaped craft with bright headlight over East Bay, CA My eyes were drawn to a very bright star on the northern horizon.  I thought it was a star because it remained in the same position for over 8 minutes. But it was too low on the horizon to be a star--and far too bright.  After about 8 minutes, it began to move to the left, and kept approaching until it was nearly overhead.  Looking directly up at it, it flew by--very quietly--and had a chevron/boomerang shape.  It seemed to be going east of where a plane would be going (to either SFO or OAK airports).  As it passed, I could make out smaller lights--I can't remember whether they were colored.  It was a clear, warm night with many stars visible.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
