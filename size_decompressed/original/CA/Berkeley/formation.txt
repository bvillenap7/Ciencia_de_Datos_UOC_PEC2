This dance went on in different variations for awhile, with small lights suddenly emerging from the two large ones, orbiting or zinging around the big ones, then reuniting and disappearing. Mid-way through siting, a plane took off from SFO just west of the lights.  Couldn't tell if it was north or south of the lights, but wasn't that far away from my vantage point high in the Berkeley Hills.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Formation over Berkeley, CA.;2015-04-26 22:00:00;5 minutes;Formation over Berkeley CA i was d home on I-80 west towards Berkeley.  There's a big turn just passed the Carlson exit which gives you a view of Berkeley.  Right then I saw the formation. It was about 25 degrees off the horizon, so pretty low.  They were not higher than the red pulsating lights from the radio tower near by.  Seeing the formation made me feel uneasy.   I quickly got off the freeway at the next exit and drove down to see it from a safer viewing point.  The formation by then had dispersed, but the orbs still seemed relatively close together, until they finally either went dim or flew away. There was no sound heard from these orbs and it was a clear night. I have a video which I will link later.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Sequenced lights in Oakland Hills.;2015-06-07 22:20:00;30 minutes. On & off;Sequenced lights in Oakland Hills. I was just looking outside of my window, having a smoke admiring the Oakland Hills until I noticed a large bright light in the distance, just right by the radio towers.  It was had quite a large shine and would begin to fade after 5 minutes.   After the first light, another small orb began to glow what looked like just a couple miles away from that, but seemed to be even brighter.  That one blinked quite a few times, and even changed color.   At one point. (green, red/ orange) it slowly died off, and then it got really bright, like a flash.  Almost like someone was taking a picture from really far away (I live in Emeryville).    After that light stopped, another light appears not to far from the last blinking.  The three lights became sequenced, but only one at a time.  They look like signals, really.  Really bright signalsâ€¦;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
