Two diamond UFOs over Oakland/Berkeley;2012-05-06 21:00:00;4;Two diamond UFOs over Oakland/Berkeley we went for a nice sunset hike at the reservoir.  we decided to go out to dinner in berkeley.   i took a slightly different way to get to highway 24 than normal, it was a bit faster and i never went that way before,  i was like on automatic pilot.  this new shortcut saved about 4 minutes.  we when through the Caldecott tunnel and everything was just like any of the countless times before we've had a sunday out.  immediately on the other side of the tunnel we all see two giant super bright orange/red orbs in the sky in front of us, coming in our direction.  my 19 year old son instantly knows these are not helicopters and he alerts me to that.  i look at them and i'm saying WTF. WTF. WTF.  my wife is thinking those are very weird flying lights.  my thoughts are &quotok, these cannot be planes because they are moving too slow and planes just don't fly like this.  must be a helicopter, i'll look for aviation lights, because by law there must be aviation lights.! no,  WTF this thing is completely glowing orange/red and it's pretty big.  meanwhile my wife is started to get upset with me because my driving is now erratic as i'm being completely transfixed by what i'm trying to understand.  i'm searching my memory banks,  balloon?  no.  blimp?  definitely not.  chinese lantern?  no these things are big.&quot   then they are right overhead and i'm leaning over the steering wheel looking up and swerving on the road and my wife is now seriously freaked out and yelling at me.  then i see the body of first one.  the edges are what's glowing orange/red  it has a diamond shaped metallic body and it looks big.  so does the other one, there are two of these.  as the first one passes and i make the mental connection that this is some type unidentified of craft,  my entire body gets goose pimples and i get them even now writing this.  i'm saying holy #, holy #, holy #, this is real,  that is a real UFO.  holy #, my wife yells get on the road, ! look out!  now it's behind us and i can't afford to look backw! ards to see it or else we are definitely going to crash.  i yell to my to look at it and remember everything he sees.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
