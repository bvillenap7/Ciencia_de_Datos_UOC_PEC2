Flaming object attached to balloon;2005-07-28 22:05:00;5 mins.;Flaming object attached to balloon My roommate came and pounded on my door exclaiming that there was a UFO outside.  I was a bit skeptical, but willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.   When we got out to the balcony, he pointed it out in the sky.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be a flaming bag of some sort attatched to a large balloon, probably released by someone in this neighborhood.  I had seen a similar one a few weeks ago.  I felt bad about bursting his balloon (of excitement), pardon the pun, but I recognized it right away.   We're still, however, on the lookout to see a real one.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Blazing red UFO spotted in the Northern California sky Dec 31, 2012.;2012-12-31 23:00:00;15 minutes;blazing red UFO spotted in the Northern California sky Dec 31,2012 Walking home this evening in Berkeley, CA I observed in the sky what look like a plane flying in a blaze of bright red fire.  At first glance I thought why is this plane so red, then I notice that it began slowing down in way that seemed odd for a normal plane in flight across the sky and as the  blazing red plane became closer to view I saw a second plane coming clearer into view and then first plane began ascending higher into the sky.  I said to myself that it must be a helicopter until it became going further up into the sky than I had ever seen a helicopter ascend. I saw a neighborhood acquaintance that is in a wheel chair approaching and I called out to him to look up at what was happening. While we were watching the first plane ascend so high that it look like a red dot the second plane was moving up higher while moving in the direction of San Francisco it was at that time we could see a third plane approaching as if was on fire then all three were gone from view I was back into my apartment and the time was 11:50. I am so glad that I did not have that experience alone the two young men that so were also amazed at what we had just experienced. I had planed to visit with my friend and bring in the New Year with friends but I felt to hot inside and decide that I would return home after visiting only 10 minutes.   I cannot stress enough how glad I am that I had two people around me to witness this incredible sighting. You have any questions please contact me.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Orange orbs over the Bay Area, CA on New Years and 3 made a triangle.;2013-01-01 00:05:00;5-10 minutes;Orange orbs over the Bay Area, CA on New Years and 3 made a triangle. Just after midnight we were gathered on the balcony of our apartment building in Berkeley to watch the fireworks from the Embarcadero in San Francisco.   We were watching the fireworks when 2 large orange orbs appeared in the Southern Sky and moved slowly across the Bay.    I notified my friend to watch them with me, and we speculated on whether or not they were planes.  The two then disappeared, as having been extinguished.  Just after that, 3 orange orbs in a triangle formation then came from the South Bay and two disappeared while one grew dimmer but moved to a place high in the sky.   Two more orange orbs came from the South and seemed to be advancing towards the orb that had stopped and then all of them 'extinguished' out of sight, and out of our lives.   There were three witnesses.  The third witness did not see the triangle that the orbs made, but saw the orb that was suspended in the sky, and the two orbs that came from the South and followed.
