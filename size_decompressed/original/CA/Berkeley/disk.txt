At first we thought it was a star or planet. It appeared to be pulsating. We got out our telescope. With the telescope, there was a black disc, and this was surrounded by a pulsating orange halo. It slowly moved below the horizon over about five  minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke briefly with this witness and addressed whether the object might have been an aircraft flying west, reflecting light from the setting sun.  The witness reported that they had addressed that possibility, and rejected it.  The apparently got a very good look at the object, and found it to be exceptionally strange.  Witnesses hold quite responsible jobs.  PD));37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Sighting is limited to photographic evidence, a single photograph taken pointing west from the Berkeley Hills (California).;2009-01-18 18:45:00;2 seconds;Sighting is limited to photographic evidence, a single photograph taken pointing west from the Berkeley Hills (California). I did not see these crafts with my own eyes, but instead observed them in a photograph that I took (without intending to capture an image of the objects).  There are 4-5 disc-shaped objects flying in a length ballistic pattern perhaps mid-way between the hills and Marin County, over the bay.  Close inspection of the objects seems to reveal different angles of flight by the objects, and some reflectivity consistent with the position of the sun is present. The image is one in a series of four taken within seconds of each other, and the objects do not appear in the other three images, which presents fairly strong evidence that the objects are not the result of dust on the lens. It is not out of the question that the objects are a product of the camera pointing at the sun, which can create some strange effects, but this seems like a somewhat far-fetched explanation.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
