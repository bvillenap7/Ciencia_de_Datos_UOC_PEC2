Unknown Streaks of Lights near Berkeley Hills/Moraga;2009-01-21 00:00:00;20 minutes;Unknown Streaks of Lights near Berkeley Hills/Moraga I first noticed the flashes of light streaking across the sky at around 11:30, heading into a mountain pass to go up to the Berkeley Hills and Grizzly Peak from Moraga. The light streaked across the sky at a speed 5-10x that of a plane, and looped around several times, ruling out any possibility of a commercial plane. The lights continued to flash across the sky, and were visible from around a 10 mile radius. The instances were frequent but short lived, the streaks would last for one or two seconds at most. I saw the streaks without any doubt in my mind at least 15 counted times. My friend was with me and corroborates the whole thing.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Light-distortion moved methodically across San Francisco Bay to above Treasure Island, dropped, returned along same path.;2009-02-01 20:30:00;15-25 min?;Light-distortion moved methodically across San Francisco Bay to above Treasure Island, dropped, returned along same path. 3 of us were sitting on a rock outcropping with a good view of San Francisco after dinner. Persons 2 and 3 were busy discussing classes. Person 1 noticed a strange shimmering that seemed to appear in front of the Golden Gate Bridge, after which it began to move south. As it passed in front of the city lights, the lights in a small spherical area would become distorted (brighter and wavering), and return to normal as the object moved farther left in the field of view. Person 1 pointed the object out to Persons 2 and 3, neither of whom could pick out the object until Person 1 told them to look at the TransAmerica Tower and told them exactly as the object passed in front. They then all followed the object with their eyes as it continued to move slowly southward over the Bay. The object stopped directly above the island that cuts the Bay Bridge in half (Treasure Island I think it's called?), and we lost sight of it as it dropped directly down and out of our line of sight to the buildings (again slowly). We started talking excitedly about what we had seen before Person 1 again noticed the object it had risen back up to roughly the point from which it started its descent. The object then returned along the same path it originally took. As it came in front of the Golden Gate Bridge again, it began to shrink rapidly and move slowly upwards in our field of vision until it no longer distorted the Golden Gate Bridge lights. It seemed to be moving away from us at this point, but we could be wrong as well we could not, after all, see the object, but only the circular pattern of distorted light. I am Person 3.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Saucer shaped object quickly appears and disappears over Golden Gate Bridge;2009-02-07 17:29:00;Within A Minute;Saucer shaped object quickly appears and disappears over Golden Gate Bridge UFO SIGHTING FEB 07 2009 I started to take pictures across the  bay from Golden Gate Fields of the sunset near the Golden Gate Bridge using a Canon HV30 Camcorder. Since sunsets finish within several minutes or so I decided to take continuous shots. I discovered a saucer shape object just above the Golden Gate Bridge in one of my photos dismissing it as a passenger blimp that I had seen occasisionally flying during the day around the bay within the past year. But after looking at the time intervals between my shots which had occurred  twice a minute at most once a minute, it was quite clear that a blimp could not fly out of view fast enough. I can formally submit three photos for analysis: A: Taken at 5:29 PM ( Camcorder stamped it as 6:29 PM because I forgot to adjust for daylight savings ) B: Taken at 5:29 PM ( Contains the alleged saucer shape object  ) C: Taken at 5:30 PM ( Saucer object disappeared )  The photo in question can be seen on my website indicated below. Once you see the photo there, please let me know as I would like to remove it. www.flickr.com/mgalasso;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
