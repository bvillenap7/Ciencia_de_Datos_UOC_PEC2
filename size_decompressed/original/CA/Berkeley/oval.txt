huge illuminated object with flashing lights moving smoothly over Bay Bridge toward Oakland;2003-11-23 18:00:00;~8 mins;huge illuminated object with flashing lights moving smoothly over Bay Bridge toward Oakland We (I my wife and two of our daughters) were in our car returning from a weekend trip to Fort Ross. While moving slowly with a traffic along 580E toward 880S, we noticed a huge illuminated object hanging over Bay Bridge. There were a lot of lights on this object with some of them (on the top of its oval looking shape) flashing. The flashing light(s) seemed to be blue while all other lights were wight-yellow. The object started to move slowly and smoothly toward Oakland while descending gradually. We could not see it anymore after reaching ramp to 880S. My radio (which I tried to turn on while observing the phenomenon) stopped working.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
The object hovered over a park then flew off extremely fast;2005-02-02 07:30:00;20 seconds;The object hovered over a park then flew off extremely fast I was in the shower and I looked out the window, I saw an orange oval, it was fairly high in the sky, once I saw it, it just hovered and a few seconds later it started to fly off, I was surprised at how fast it moved, then it was gone as far as I could see.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Large oval, moving slowly across building line, emitting extreme bright light with a tail of vapor.;2006-03-05 14:00:00;5 sec. ???;Large oval, moving slowly across building line, emitting extreme bright light with a tail of vapor. Driving in car along Gilman st. when an extremely bright light appeared in the sky.  After blinding me it seemed to head in my direction which made me flee the scene.  The light had the intensity of an arc weld and lit up the entire street.  There was absolutely no sound as it drifted a couple hundred feet in the sky.  I returned to the location minutes later and it was gone.  Interesting that the power had then gone out in the area.  I ask people in the location if they had scene anything but all had not.  I tried to reason that it was a transformer but it was very uncharacteristic of an electrical explosion since it was so constant.  I it was overcast and rainy at the time and this object drifted below the cloud cover. Anyone see it?;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
hovering oval pulsing in different colors, seems to be towing a smaller light below it, in the night sky;2008-03-26 00:00:00;30:00;hovering oval pulsing in different colors, seems to be towing a smaller light below it, in the night sky I' see a light almost at 11: 00 in the night sky, it pulse Red- then- white- orange-yellow-red, directly below An index finger in distance is a smaller oval light blue grey in color, the larger seems to rock back and forth, ever so slightly, I thought it might be a helicopter a first but there is no sound, and it is still pretty much stationary.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
Low-altitude red-orange orb slows down, then recedes to the size of a star and disappears.;2012-05-05 19:45:00;3-5 minutes;low-altitude red-orange orb slows down, then recedes to the size of a star and disappears. My friend and I were walking around in North Berkeley a little before sunset. She said, &quotwhat's that in the sky?&quot I glanced and said &quotits just a plane.&quot  She wasn't so sure, and after only a few seconds we both knew it was no plane. The object was moving too slowly to be a plane and was seemingly at a much lower altitude than a plane. It seemed to change speed, slowing down as it got closer to us.  It was quite low, hard to say exactly but perhaps only a couple thousand feet or less. At one point the object stopped and then began receding.  It had become larger as it got closer to us, then got smaller very rapidly.  It receded to the size of a star, then smaller, then disappeared.  The impression I got from this movement was that it shot off directly into space at an extreme velocity. It didn't shoot across the sky, but seemingly outward. The object was reddish orange.  It's hue changed subtly over the course of the sighting.  It was orb-shaped, ovular or circular but the &quotfireball&quot description may be appropriate as well, since it glowed and seemed to give off a dim radiance. Why I am convinced it was not a normal craft: -changed speed -changed direction -appeared much larger than an airplane -shaped like a ball or energy or orb (fireball) -appeared to glow with a deep red radiance, not merely reflect sunlight as some planes do around sunset.
