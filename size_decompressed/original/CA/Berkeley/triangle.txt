Triangular Configuration of Red Lights over Berkeley, CA;2010-11-02 19:30:00;5-7 minutes;Triangular Configuration of Red Lights over Berkeley, CA November 2, 2010  At approximately 7:30 pm, Pacific Standard Time, I was driving from Kensington, CA into Berkeley, CA on The Arlington Ave.  The sky was dark and perfectly clear not obscured by fog as this area so often is.  Headed southeast, I saw a triangular configuration of red lights on the horizon.  The triangle formed by the lights was equilateral, and its apex pointed east.  The red lights did not flash, and although it was difficult to discern from my altitude, were hovering stationary above the west side of Berkeley. The lights were about twice the size of Venus, a prominent star this time of year, which was located to the east of the lights.  Nearby commercial planes moved above and below the configuration, and were roughly the same size as the red lights, but were white, as planes usually appear.  Using my fingers to measure, I estimated the sides of the triangle to be about 1 to 1 ½ inches in length between each red light.  The triangular configuration remained stationary for about three minutes, and then started moving east towards the Berkeley Hills.   I cannot estimate their speed, but I was driving on Euclid St. at 25 – 30 mph through a residential area, and the configuration was moving in and out of my purview rather quickly. As I continued further south, the red triangular configuration moved directly east across the horizon, losing altitude and then dropping behind the trees of the Berkeley Hills, near campus.  I stopped at Euclid and Hearst St. in an attempt to see where they had gone, but they were no longer visible. It is (perhaps) worth mentioning my cell phone spontaneously turned off and then turned on a few minutes before the sighting.

Three dim lights in a triangle, and two others, all moving across the sky.;2020-02-07 18:59:00;10 seconds;Three dim lights in a triangle, and two others, all moving across the sky. Date: 8 Feb 202 Time: 7:01 pm (PST) Location:  South Berkeley, CA  I went outside to look for the ISS that was passing overhead.  I spotted the beginning of the pass in the north-west sky, looking like a moving star, and went inside to get a pair of binoculars.  I came back outside and tried to find the ISS in the north sky.  As I did I saw three dim lights in a triangle shape, and two similar lights a small distance off from the others, overhead and slightly to the north.   The five lights were all moving easterly at a speed approximating the speed with which the ISS crosses (the speed of a low flying airplane.)  I thought at first these might be from the ISS, but it was much too much distance between the lights for this to make sense (the ISS would have to have been at the height of a low airplane to be separated by such a distance.)   The lights were not flashing, were not colored, and were all moving “together” across the sky.  They were dim, not bright like stars.  I lost them behind a building, and then tried to re-sight the ISS, which I found in the south-east sky, at the end of its transit.;37.8726163841808;-122.269972881356
