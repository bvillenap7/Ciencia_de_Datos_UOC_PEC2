Looked up at 4:00 in the morning, very clear night, and saw approx. 12 lights in a chevron shape flying from north to south.  It covered from up to past the horizon in about 4 seconds.  Seemed like to tip lights on each end were slightly forward and out of alignment with the rest of them.  The size of the craft, however high it was I can't guess, seemed to be about the size of the constellation of the Pleades.  Very similar in appearance, as though the constellation were flying across the sky. Found a picture of the Lubbock (sp?) lights over Texas in the early 50's. Almost exactly the same thing. 11 months later saw (Sept. 12, 1995), also at 4:00 am I saw another chevron shaped ship, but this time it was much higher, seemed to be flying away like out of the atmosphere and away.  Instead of having lights, though, this one was a solid glowing amber color.  Watched it for about six seconds until it was out of sight.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Arrowhead seen above 215 freeway near Riverside Ca.;2005-08-28 09:45:00;5 minutes;Arrowhead seen above 215 freeway near Riverside Ca. My Girlfriend was cruising on the 215 freeway towards San Bernardino and for the second time in about a month she saw an arrowhead shaped craft suspended above freeway traffic a little ways in front of her.  The freeway went from 60mph about to 10-5 mph.  Commuters were on cell phones pointing up at the object.  The craft moved horizontally very gradually towards some mountains and stopped but then dissapeared out of sight due to obstruction by mountains.  The craft looked like a small arrowhead and was extremely shiny.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
