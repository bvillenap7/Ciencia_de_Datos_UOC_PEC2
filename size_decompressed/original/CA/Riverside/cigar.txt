Two white, cigar shaped objects, pulsing with light.;2008-12-24 07:18:00;1.25 minutes;Two white, cigar shaped objects, pulsing with light. On Wednesday, December 24, 2008 at 7:18 in the morning, I was driving North on Van Buren Blvd. in Riverside, Ca.   We were expecting a storm and the sky to the Northwest of where I was traveling was very grey.  Set against the grey sky, I saw two oval shaped objects.   What really caught my eye was the way they seemed to be pulsating with light. The two objects were cigar or oval shaped.  They looked to be Southwest of Mount Baldy.  The objects were parallel to each other with the lower one slightly to the right, or East of the other.  The whole sighting lasted just over a minute.  Both objects seemed to light up and then fade, repeatedly.  They looked to be pulsing with light.  Each pulse probably took a few seconds to complete, from getting bright to fading back out. As I was watching the objects and looking for somewhere to pull over, and perhaps snap a picture, the objects just disappeared.  They brightened and faded and then they were just gone.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Large twinkling/flashing light with smaller one across from it, spinning like a baton;2010-05-21 23:34:00;20-30 seconds;Large twinkling/flashing light with smaller one across from it, spinning like a baton Every night my mother and I stand in the back patio and smoke a cigarette before bed.  We live near the Riverside Airport, so we always see helicopters, commercial airplanes and jets fly over us.   At about 11:34-36ish at night, I'm looking up at the night sky taking a drag when I notice a twinkling, moving light.  Thinking it's probably a plane or chopper, I just kept watching the sky. But then I noticed that the twinkling/flashing light was moving pretty fast, and was hovering above a smaller light.  As it flew before me, it spinned like a baton at least three times before I noticed it was somewhat cigar/rod shaped. Meanwhile, I was also trying to get my mother's attention without keeping my eyes off the UFO.  I tried to speak, but all I could say was Oh my G-d! and Look!.  My mother didn't see anything except the larger twinkling light.  From what I can recall she was either staring at me to try and understand what I was saying or behind me putting something away in the backyard.  I wouldn't call her a witness because 1) she wasn't looking at the sky and 2) she wears triple-lense reading glasses and we were outside in the dark with no lights on. I would call myself an observer.  Every-night I look into the night sky.  Every time we're on a road trip to Vegas, I see at least five shooting stars on the way there and back.  When I was three months pregnant with my boy, I saw what I believe today to have been a comet.  But what I saw about an hour and a half ago was nothing like this.  It was just so surreal, I almost had an anxiety attack.  Funny thing is, now there's a bunch of loud choppers flying over my house, there's been at least three already.  Whoever is reading this may choose to swallow it with a grain of salt, but only those who saw it too can vouch for me.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
