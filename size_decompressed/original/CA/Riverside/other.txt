Eight  objects seen within 10 minutes in broad daylight.;2001-09-23 09:35:00;10 minutes;Eight  objects seen within 10 minutes in broad daylight. The morning was warm with absolutely clear skys and no wind.  A group of six of us were gathered after church at one of their homes.  Four of us had stepped out into the back yard to smoke (cigarettes).  I was watching an airliner fly through the sky about 1000 Ft or more in altitude and noticed a bright/shiney round object sitting what appeared to be stationary well above and N.W. of the passenger jet.  I asked the others what they thought it could be and asked for some binoculars to view it better.  Most said that it must be a balloon.  It was to hard to see clearly what it was even through the binoculars.  It did look circular in shape.  Several of us took turns with the binocs. to see if we could make out what it was.  It remained stationary the whole time we watched it, not moving up, down or horizontally.  As one of the others was looking through the binocs. I began to scan the sky and saw another airliner heading North at what appeared to be a normal flying altitude of maybe 2000 Ft. plus.  Then all of a sudden I noticed a formation of seven Bright/shiney oval objects as large as the airliner, flying South far above the airliner.  These objects had a bright sheen to them, almost like a halo around them.  Again I brought this to everyones attention and most dismissed these as military aircraft doing manuvers, geese or something else.  The odd thing about this formation was it looked like a lower case y flying sideways, tail first and that at the altitude these were flying they were still as large as the airliner.  Also noteably peculiar was that three of these craft rotated/changed positions in the formation with relative ease.  That is to say that they dropped out of formation, dropped back behind the others, then moved to their new position with ease.  Very fluid and quick  movements, which seems a strange ability considering their size.  Their rate of speed was no faster than normal airliners as a formation.  After the formation left our view I returned my attention to the area where we ob! served t he balloon and it was no longer in view.  The whole time this transpired was no more than 10 minutes.  Our group consisted of various ages and backgrounds.  As for me, I am prior military, 44 years old, and definately keeping a closer watch on our skys.  These are not the first peculiar aircraft I have sighted or reported.  I am one that tends not to speculate to much as to where these unusual craft come from.  I believe they are made by man until proven otherwise.  Just seems strange that with all these different objects flying around, how is it that the men who makes them or flys them hasn't bragged about it or let the cat out of the bag so to speak?;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Orange V shaped object observed overhead;2005-02-15 09:30:00;5 minutes;Orange V shaped object observed overhead On 02/15/2005 I had just returned home after taking my son to school, about 0930. I looked up at the sky as I walked from my car to the house to look at the clouds.  Almost directly overhead, in a clear patch between the clouds, I saw a brilliant, glowing orange V-shaped object.  It appeared stationary when I first saw it.   I went into the house to get a small spotting scope that I use for bird watching and returned. Using the scope, I saw that the V object was not solid orange, but had alternating sections of orange and white.  It had some type of structure to it that I could not quite make out due to distance.  The best I and describe it is a length of a crane or bridge, with it’s intricate crosspieces, bent at a 45 degree angle, painted orange and white. I was not a wing shape at all, as the arms of the V did not have much width to them.   The object would drift in and out of the clouds as they passed by to the NE, the clouds sometimes partially obscuring the object. I would estimate the size as similar to the wingspan of a commercial jet aircraft.  The object seemed to maneuver periodically to remain near the edge of the clouds.  I watched until the cloud cover thickened and the object was not visible any longer, about 5 minutes. I realize this is almost 5 years ago and I am just reporting it now.  At the time, I assumed that, due to the color, it was some sort of experimental device.  I also considered the date (day after Valentine’s day) of the sighting, that it may have been a balloon arch that got loose, but I have since had the chance to observe balloons released into the sky and they did not behave or look they way this object did.   I am reporting it now since I see so many reports of V and triangle shaped objects, maybe this is some piece of the puzzle.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Fluorescent white wing like ship traveling north west, slow, no sound, over roof of house at 4am.;2008-09-17 04:00:00;12 seconds;Fluorescent white wing like ship traveling north west, slow, no sound, over roof of house at 4am. I think around 6oft. length and 30ft. wide. maybe 20ft. wide.  I'm just not sure. It was fluorescent white. It had wings with no body. It was traveling north/west, extremely low, over my roof, about 40ft. high.  No sound at all. 45 minutes later saw a white orb traveling around 150 ft. high, maybe a lot higher, in that general area.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Flat football shaped object hoving over passing planes;2010-03-17 10:00:00;5 minutes;Flat football shaped object hoving over passing planes I was at my high school with my boyfriend in the football field and a passing plane caught my attention.  There was a shiny, fish/football shaped object floating above and a small distance from the plane.  It was rotating on it's axis, moving very slowly, much slower than the plane.  The object was about a forth smaller than the plane, accounting for perspective. It went in a perfectly straight line and stopped.  It seemed to stop rotating, then changed the direction of its rotation from counter-clockwise to clockwise.  Then as another plane passed below it, it changed its trajectory and moved higher and away at a slight angle until neither I nor my boyfriend could see it anymore.  He didn't believe me that it was a UFO, he said it was balloons, but I've never seen balloons do what that object did.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Friend's phone call leads to mutual sighting of object with odd 'plume'.;2014-12-12 19:22:00;5-7 seconds;Friend's phone call leads to mutual sighting of object with odd 'plume'. ((NUFORC Note:  Atlas V missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 19:19 hrs. (PST)  PD)) At 19:21 - according to my phone's call log - I received a call from my best friend, (who lives just over ten miles away in Norco, CA.), telling me that she was startled and amazed to be looking at 'something really weird' in the night skies over her home. As I headed out my own door (to see if I could spot anything), I realized that it was unlikely I'd be able to even see the sky at all - due to massive rains all day and low, thick, stormy clouds not to mention our distance from one another. However, as I stepped out from between the houses and into the open, I found it to be largely clearing above and to the west. As I scanned the dark, patchy skies, I immediately spotted several aircraft tracking and blinking as on any normal, Friday evening. As she continued trying to relate to me in excited bewilderment what she was seeing, I was just beginning to scan the night sky above my own house when she suddenly cursed that it had vanished it had abruptly just 'winked out'. As she started-in bitterly about its sudden absence, off to my west (toward Norco) - something odd suddenly DID catch my eye and I had to stop her. It was something odd and it was tracking southward. Whatever it was, it was clearly and definitely NOT an airplane. I was confused by its appearance. I initially considered a meteor, but no ...then a comet... but also no. It appeared to be a small, solid, red light, shaped rather oblong lengthwise - like a thick grain of rice - with a comparatively huge, translucent 'bloom' behind it kind of like the ones that envelop the rear halves of fighter jets as they pierce the sound barrier. But that's not what this was. It was utterly soundless and appeared to be moving more at the pace of a Cessna or helicopter, rather than any sort of jet. Gobsmacked, I focused and strained and squinted to get as good of a look as possible as I mumbled into my cellphone what I was seeing as she excitedly confirmed that it was exactly what she had just been observing. I was able to clearly see it for a good six seconds, as it moseyed slowly along, due south - directly (and maddeningly) toward one of the many low, pink, angry clouds around the area. It then moved behind the cloud from whence I never saw it emerge. I checked the 'color-change' box because although to me the object shone in an unblinking, unchanging 'stoplight red', my friend swears that it appeared as a bright white, to her. But what we both DID clearly see was the huge 'plume' at the trailing end. It was in fact this odd feature that first drew the eye. It looked like the top of an open, translucent 'umbrella' curved back and emanating directly from the rear of the object. Again, there were typical, nighttime aviation activities ongoing in the skies above me - flickering jetliners and local flights headed this way and that at their various flight levels. I spotted about five or six flashing lights immediately and easily identifiable as normal, evening air traffic - but they all seemed oblivious to the object, which - in fairness - was more or less in a patch of sky sort of off to itself - and fairly equidistant from any other traffic. Sadly, I've been unable to find any local (nor anywhere) mention of this phenomenon on the internet. SURELY she and I COULDN'T have been the only ones in Southern California to have seen this amazing object.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

Crescent moving NW over Riverside CA;2020-11-04 18:00:00;20 seconds;Crescent moving NW over Riverside CA I am the only witness I know of.  I am an astrophysicist and can usually explain these things.  I was not in any way inebriated when I saw this.  At approximately 6pm I was taking my trash out and looked up to admire the stars.  I noticed something moving across the sky.  It was crescent shaped, dim, and about 5 across.  It moved across about 45 degrees of sky in 10 to 20 seconds in a northwest direction.  It did not change shape or brightness.  I tried to surmise whether it was something low and hovering (a drone or maybe a group of birds moving pretty quick) or higher and moving very quickly. I thought perhaps I wasn't seeing it clearly at first but after a few seconds I could see a clear cresent shape.  The lighting on it did not change in a way I would expect if it was low.  I decided it was probably a bow shock catching the sun (now set)'s light like a noctilucent cloud.  However I am unfamiliar with what produces such long lived and steadily moving bowshock.  I did not see that there were any vandenburg launches when I looked after.  One other odd note: as I was watching it a meteor passed through it (diagonally vaguely ENE and at a very different soured of course so I assumed it was unrelated).  I'm very interested in optical phenomena and as I said am an astronomer so I usually explain these things easily.  This time while I suppose a jet or something might produce such a bow shock I am a little baffled so I thought I should report it.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
