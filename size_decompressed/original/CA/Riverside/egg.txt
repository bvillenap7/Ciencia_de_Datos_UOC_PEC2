Lime Green Egg-Shaped UFO Over Riverside,Ca;2005-12-06 16:35:00;40 minutes;Lime Green Egg-Shaped UFO Over Riverside,Ca I live in Riverside, California. I saw a ufo yesterday night on my ride home.  Riverside is surrounded by mountains, and since my home is on the top of the mountain, the road home provided a great view of the ufo.  It was a lime green, egg-shaped object, with a couple of red lights that blinked on and off on top of the object.  It was unbelievable.  The object did not move up or dowm, it only moved horizontally.  It slowly moved horizontally.  I got the feeling as if the ufo was overlookling the city, it stopped when it reached a mountain.  It then went behind the mountain, where it disappeard.  I stopped at a road near my home and saw all of it.  When it first caught my eye, it was close, and once I actually stopped by the road, it had gotten farther away.   I tried taking video and a picture with my cell phone, but the object was too far away to get a good capture.   Riverside is close to an airport, and there were at least 5 airplanes that filled the night sky. However, they all looked like airplanes do at night and they all flew at the same elevation, while the ufo flew about half the elevation a normal plane does, and was right on top of the city.   I feel like I need to tell someone, but it seems as if no one else saw it because I looked on the internet and there are no reports.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

Sept 17th. I was sitting in my car changing into some other clothes and I look through my windshield out towards the street and trees, through the trees I see a black egg-shaped floating object moving very slowly from the sky downwards towards the ground, moving very slowly I saw this object for about 20-25 seconds. I could see it so clearly right away I knew it was not a helicopter, airplane, or anything else..the ojbect was hovering to slowly and progressing down towards the ground at a shocking slow pace.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
