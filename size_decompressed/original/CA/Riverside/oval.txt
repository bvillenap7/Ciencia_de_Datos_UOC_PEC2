Oblong or ovoid luminous object,;2001-02-05 17:50:00;3-5;Oblong or ovoid luminous object, It was almost 6 PM (about 5:50, I think). As I sat down at a bus stop I noticed a bright oblong or oval-type shape toward the west. It was perhaps about 1/3 the apparent size of the full moon, and I couldn't tell how far away it was. It was low on the horizon--that is, just above trees, buildings, etc. It was bright enough and big enough to be very noticable, and yet its luminosity was kind of dullish--that is, it didn't shine--it had a kind of uniform brightness and tone. It had a bluish white color--very much like the moon. Now, it could have been an ordinary object for all I know--but I noticed it immediately, and couldn't identify it, even though I am (I think) pretty familiar with the sky, astronomical objects, aircraft, etc. I thought it might have been a blimp--maybe it was, but it didn't really seem like one. It was elongated vertically rather than horizontally, though that might be due to perspective. I watched it move with reference to various objects on the horizon: it hovered, and moved slowly a few angular degrees both horizontally and vertically. After I watched it for a few minutes, the light went out, but I could still see the silhouette of the the object against the twilight sky (the object was darker than the surrounding sky). As I recall, the dark silhouette that remained after the light went out was rectangular, not ovoid. It was in plain view of the city--I am reporting it simply because it was interesting and unfamiliar to me, although it might have just a mundane explanation!;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
I thought it was a blimp that just happened to be lit, but it was moving too fast to be a blimp.;2005-12-06 06:23:00;5-7 min;I thought it was a blimp that just happened to be lit, but it was moving too fast to be a blimp. I was called outside to see the unexplained object lighting the sky.  At first I thought it was just a blimp that happened to be entirely lit.  Then as I continued to observe it, I noticed that it was moving too fast to be a blimp. I quickly grabbed my video camera and began filming this object.  As I zoomed in all I could see was an enormous light with smaller red lights attached above and below the object. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a copy of the video, but have not yet received it.  PD));33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Oval object, flashing red & white, remains motionless in sky during gusty winds;2007-10-07 09:35:00;30 minutes;Oval object, flashing red & white, remains motionless in sky during gusty winds On 10/07/2007 about 0935 I was going for a walk. The sky was bright blue, with strong, gusty winds blowing from the northeast. I paused on a bluff that overlooks the Santa Ana riverbed to look at the scenery. I noticed a bright object in the sky to the west. I first thought it was a mylar balloon being blown by the wind, however I quickly noticed that it was not moving nearly as fast as, or in the same direction as the wind. Its path through the sky was quite smooth, not like it was being tossed about by the wind. The object was oval and was changing color every few seconds from reddish orange to white. It seemed to me that the object was slowing turning or wobbling, alternately showing a red and white surface. The object was bright, but not glittery as a metallic balloon would appear reflecting sunlight. I watched the object for about 5 minutes as it slowly made an arc towards the southeast. It finally hovered in one spot in the sky. I continued to watch it for another 20 minutes or so, and apparently it was gaining in altitude. When I first saw it, it had a definite oval shape and seemed to be about the same altitude as some general aviation type aircraft that were flying in the vicinity. After watching it hover, the size gradually reduced to where it looked like a star visible in the daytime. After watching the object for almost a half an hour, I started to walk home, stopping every so often to see if the object was still there. I hoped to locate it once I got home, where I could use binoculars to look at it, however the road took a turn through tall trees, and I was unable to find it again. It continued the flashing effect for the entire duration. There were numerous jet and propeller driven aircraft seen in the sky during the time of the sighting. I would assume it was a balloon of some type if it were not for the fact it was unaffected by the strong winds.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Very bright green light coming from oval shaped object;2013-03-09 22:10:00;20 seconds;Very bright green light coming from oval shaped object I was in my car talking on the phone in my driveway (nighttime) as i notice a faint green light, light up in the sky.  At first i thought i was just seeing things, like 3 -5 seconds later the green light comes back and so i look out of my window and i see a very bright green oval object for half a second because it was moving and lost its view because of my roof the second i saw that i ran out of my car to get a better view but the second i opened my door the entire sky lit up as if the sun was green, thats how bright it got. It was like an adjustable light in your kitchen.  It started off very faint then exponentially got brighter to the point the green was begining to turn like a bright white and then instanly went away and went back to a dark night.  I even saw the clouds shinning green. the craziest thing i have ever seen. so i ran out to the side walk and realized that i was not the only one that saw it because 2 of my neighbors saw the same thing i did. n! o sounds either;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Oval whitish-yellow light levitating in sky, kept disappearing and reappearing before our eyes.;2020-07-16 21:50:00;1/2 hour;Oval whitish-yellow light levitating in sky, kept disappearing and reappearing before our eyes. On the night of July 16th, a quarter before 10 PM, my friends and I were sitting on the roof of our car on an isolated hill to look at the city lights when we spotted a strange light in the skyline. It was a small, ovular shape emitting a whitish-yellow glow right above a set of hills in the distance. We all watched in silence for a couple minutes and noted that it couldn’t possibly be a plane as we saw many passing above in the sky. However, as we were watching the light, it disappeared right before our eyes, almost as if a giant, dark blanket was thrown over it. While we thought it was strange, we weren’t convinced it was an alien craft. But, about ten minutes after the light disappeared, we decided to head out and drive to a new overlook location higher up. As we were driving to the new location, towards the hills where we saw the light, it reappeared in the sky, this time much closer to us. This time we saw that whatever it was wasn’t attached to a radio tower, building, or anything else the ovular craft was simply levitating. And this time, much quicker, the light disappeared again.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
