fast moving unblinking silent light raced across the sky.;2000-05-09 20:58:00;45 - 85 sec;fast moving unblinking silent light raced across the sky. yellow light moving south to north view against star lit night sky. Moved in perfect straight line. No sound. no blinking lights. Looked like a star but I could tell it wasnt as far away as the stars but much higher than a helicopter and a commercial jet coming by. I thought maybe it was a satelite! It had no trail or tail. No wings. Just a star sixed glowing light. It crossed from 1030 (just over the little mountain out back) to 230 (over the roof of our house and far enough out to fade into the glow of LA) in about 50 seconds. Way faster than I've ever seen a military jet come across especially up high. And it was so quiet. no sonic boom or nothing. Wonder if it showed on local radar? Ontario Airport, Corona Airport and Adams Ave Airport are all nearby. Would appreciate your feedback on this. PS we dont drink or do drugs. Didnt have camera available at the time. my wife saw it too.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Bright Green Circle over 60 FWY;2003-11-20 17:40:00;10-15 secs;Bright Green Circle over 60 FWY I was driving west bound on the 60 fwy traffic was moderate.  My carpool partner and I  witnessed a Bright Green circle appear over the Fwy. First there was nothing then it appeared.  It was about the normal altitude of a small plane 500-1000 ft. I would guess. We thought it might be a Firework and then it started to fall.  As soon as it began its descent it shot down at an angle behind the mountain at an incredible rate of speed.  I know many others witnessed this.  This is just to the left of the landing path of Ontario International Airport. This is the first time I have ever witnessed anything like it.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
a hexagon formation of moving, pulsating lights above our head;2003-12-17 22:30:00;1 hour or more;a hexagon formation of moving, pulsating lights above our head Ever since I first starting watching the bright star like object in the south eastern sky,  that moves around like a honey bee going from flower to flower, I have tried (usually in vain) to find someone to come outside with me and see what I'am seeing so many nights.  Well, I was at my boyfriends (it was 10:30pm) and I went over to his neighbors house to ask if he'd watch the stars with me and he came right out and we sat on his steps.  I pointed at the object that I was watching move earlier and said see that star right there? tell me if you see anything strange.  It wasn't 1 minute later that he stated he definately saw this star moving around like I had.  I took the binoculars to have a better look and I noticed a hexigon formation of these stars right above our heads (high up but close enough to see fairly clearly) and although they looked like bright stars, they were moving around too.  It was clearly a formation of objects perfectly spaced from eachother in a hexigon pattern. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Orange glowing object seen over Riverside County, releasing small glowing red objects;2008-02-24 23:00:00;3 to 5 minutes;Orange glowing object seen over Riverside County, releasing small glowing red objects I saw a small craft with an orange glow, moving slowly (maybe 100 to 200 MPH) through the sky last night.  It was heading from west to the north-east, moving fairly slow and about at a height of maybe 40,000 FT.   I noticed it right away, in that it didn't have the same glow of a commercial or private plane.  Not to mention, the entire object was luminescent/glowing (it wasn't the headlight of an airplane, but just as bright).  Anyhow, as it began to head north, I started noticing small red glowing objects were being released from the craft.  These small objects would propel themselves and an incredible high rate, straight down, or in a 90 degree angle and then just disappear.  These red glowing objects were being released, every 5 seconds or so.  After 3 of these glowing-red objects were released, the craft then released 3 more objects, all at once, then begin to accelerate and incredible rate of speed.  As it was accelerating, it begin to lose it's orange glow and literally began to disappear! Before it disappeared, it seem to accelerate to over a 2 thousand miles an hour (from 200 MPH to 2000 MPH with in 2 or 3 seconds).  I watched this object for approximately 5 minutes (from start to finish).;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Dull orange orb suddenly appears;2010-07-03 22:42:00;1 minute approx.;Dull orange orb suddenly appears On 07/03/2010 at 2242 hours, I was sitting on my back porch looking at the sky.  The sky was clear, with stars, satellites and aircraft visible.  A dull orange colored orb suddenly switched on about 30 degrees above the southern horizon.  It was large in comparison to the stars and planets, I would estimate it was the size of a pea at arm's length.  It was moving quickly in an arc heading towards the northeast, faster than any of the aircraft that were visible but too slow to be a meteor.   The orb had an appearance similar to a circular charcoal briquet, with the center slightly flickering as it moved.  It was not very bright at all, as a landing light on a plane would be, and its circular shape was sharply defined.  It did not leave a trail of any type or make any sound.   I watched it until it disappeared behind the roof of my house.  I ran to the front yard, but was unable to locate it again.   I cannot say how high it might have been except that it did not seem to be as high as a satellite.   There were numerous commercial and general aviation aircraft in the sky at the same time and I could clearly hear the sounds they made.   A lot of neighbors were shooting off skyrockets, but the orb was clearly not any type of firework.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
20-25 bright orange orbs in full moon night sky, formed a line and changed direction, then disappeared;2013-09-17 21:45:00;2-3 minutes;20-25 bright orange orbs in full moon night sky, formed a line and changed direction, then disappeared Bright Orange Orbs began to appear low on the Western horizon, they began to appear in intervals of about seven seconds apart in pairs, they rose high in the sky and formed a curved string heading east then taking a southern turn, after about seven seconds from taking the turn then they disappeared.  One final orb came last, following the others---it was twice the size and more intensely bright than the earlier smaller ones.  They all pulsated. There were approx. 20 to 25 orbs. Witnesses were a 17 year old & a 14 year old (daughters), a 52 year old (mom) and a 55 year old (dad).;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
