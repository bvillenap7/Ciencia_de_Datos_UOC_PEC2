Green fireball, very slowly descending;2006-11-19 17:36:00;2-3 seconds;Green fireball, very slowly descending Just observed a large, greenish-white fireball descending in the southwest sky. I had just stepped out to look at the evening sky, when I noticed the fireball slowly dropping, almost straight down. It did not glitter or fluctuate in intensity like other fireballs and meteors I have seen, nor did it leave any trail that I could determine. Its diameter appeared to be about that of a pea held at arm's length. It disappeared behind Mt. Rubidoux, which is just west of my location. What seemed odd was the very slow speed of the fireball, the lack of a trail, and the consistency of brightness. It did not resemble any meteor or fireball I have ever seen. It was definitely NOT fireworks of any sort. There were a number of airliners and private planes visible in the sky at the time, most likely there are other witnesses.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
An orange fireball like light moved right to left, than stopped and hovered.;2007-07-04 22:21:00;Ten minutes;An orange fireball like light moved right to left, than stopped and hovered. I SAW AN ORANGE FIREBALL MOVE RIGHT TO LEFT THAN HOVER!  	I saw an orange fireball move right to left, than hover. I am not the only one to see it yesterday July 4, 2007. I was inside helping my girlfriend cook, when my brother says come outside there is a strange light in the sky. I  ran outside to see what it was. I looked up and saw an orange fireball moving south west. Almost like a meteor without a tail. 	As I watched it, my hole family came outside and saw it, as well as my next door neighbors. I was astonished when the fireball like light stopped and started to move backwards towards north east. It then stopped again and hovered for about five minutes. I could not believe what I was seeing at this point. Everyone on my street, outside at the time, saw it. 	After hovering, the light then changed direction again. It start to head east. I watched it move off in the distance and become real dim. It looked like it turned into a star and then disappeared. I have never seen anything like this in the sky before. It was so odd that I got goose bumps all over my body. I was actually freaked out by the strange orange fireball looking light.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Fast traveling object during late night;2008-01-12 01:30:00;25 seconds;Fast traveling object during late night I layed awake around 1:30 in the morning. I was alone and my friend was asleep on the couch next to me. I looked out my window into the cloudless sky and saw a spec it looked like an airplane but was WAYY to fast and to small to either. I see planes go over my house all the time as Ontario airport is not to far away and this object was definetly not following any flight pattern..also knowing this as my mom is a pilot that flys in and out of ontario airport. It was to me what looked like a firefly going about 1,000 m.p.h. ALOT faster than a plane for sure. It's altitude was roughly about 2,000 feet. I have looked in the sky every night since then and have seen NOTHING going the same direction as this object;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Bright orange light floating across the sky;2012-07-05 08:00:00;2 minutes;I was in my room and my dad was in his room when he noticed an object in the sky through his window and went to the front yard where my brother, sister, and mom were.  My brother ran to my room to call me outside to see what they were all looking at.  I looked up and saw a bright orange light floating across the sky.  I lost sight of the object behind the trees and it was gone after that.  My sister claims that when she first saw the object it was changing different colors like one that we witnessed a year before on independence day when we were all in the backyard.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
