possible explanation for sightings at Redlands, Mead Valley,  Cabazon this date;2001-02-18 19:00:00;2-3 minutes;possible explanation for sightings at Redlands, Mead Valley,  Cabazon this date I was just looking at some recent sightings for the Riverside area, read three from 2/18/02 in Redlands, Mead Valley and Cabazon. I think I can explain these sightings. I was on patrol and saw a white, disc shaped object approaching from the eastern sky on that same evening. Object was as previously described, white glowing disc shape, apparent colored lights on the side, moving at aircraft speed with no sound. At the time I first saw it, it would have coming from the Cabazon/Redlands area, passing over Moreno Valley and heading towards Mead Valley. It was quite spectacular to see. I took out some binoculars to observe the object more closely. On closer inspection, I could see that it was a small advertising blimp which was illuminated from within by bright white lights. The skin was translucent, giving the impression of a glowing disk or cigar. The blimp had multicolored lettering on the sides (I couldn't quite make out what it said) giving the impression of rows of colored lights. This is the only time I have seen this particular type of blimp locally. There is/was a company which makes blimps located at the old Norton AFB site, possibly a test flight of a blimp for delivery to some other part of the country?;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
spinning, orange, glowing object disappears and reappears in a different area within seconds;2003-01-29 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;spinning, orange, glowing object disappears and reappears in a different area within seconds I went out to take my dog out before bed and noticed an orange type of star. I first thought of Mars and I stood admiring its brightness and color.  I then noticed that it began to move.  I stood watching and waiting to see some sort of a beacon to identify it as some type of plane, helicopter, blimp or weather balloon etc. It then moved across the sky with a bright, orange, flame colored glow.  this took about a minute as it moved slowly.  I didn't think much of it yet because it moved slowly.  I called my wife who was inside watching television and she wasn't impressed at all until it suddenly disappeared.  My first thought was it disappeared behind the marine layer but then we noticed that stars in the same area were still visible. She then noticed that it re-appeared on the horizon to the south.  We both watched it again for about 10 seconds before it again disappeared.  We were both still skeptical and I went inside to get the telephone to phone my father.  I went outside again after a 2-3 minutes and my wife soon followed and this time I searched and saw nothing. I turned to go back in the house and looked up to the east and saw the same orange glow quickly approaching our direction at a low altitude.  It moved westwardly across the sky and at that altitude and we saw it pass over us and noticed that there was an outer edge that was spinning slowly in a clockwise direction. We were able to see this because of the orange glow underneath appeared to be lighting up some type of marker in a square shape that rotated. We both watched as it moved west and after about 15 seconds it disappeared.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

My Father in law saw this on his way home ,There was a bright light as he was driving down the freeway he kept watching it for over 10 minutes it sat still and then it slowly moved over a small mountain where it is now staying still, it is very bright like a lightbulb and looks like a satellite dish in shape and it had a halo around it  it is near March Air force base  but it doesnt look like a helicopter or plane or any other object he's seen;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Floursent green stars that actually fly  in the skies over So. Cal.;2004-12-01 00:00:00;40 min;Floursent green stars that actually fly  in the skies over So. Cal. I live in Riverside/Norco California.  I have been closely observing the skies over these two cities since Nov 2003.  At that time i observed (on 11/16/03)a very large and bright and beautiful star in the eastern sky.  It was a sight to behold! It didn't just twinkle, it was a light show all by its self!!  Red, green. blue,gold and purple beams of light shooting out from it!! and as I cont. to watch it, I realized that this star was actually moving horizontally back and fourth as if it was flying! Well needless to say, the night skies captivated my full attention from that day on and I was hooked on astronomy and the possibility of UFO's in the skies over Norco California!!  Well, I did some investigating and the awesome star I saw I believe is Serius. The brightest star above earth.  It becomes visible to So. Cal in November through around March or so.  And although I know Serius IS a star...I have to say that I have never seen a star with the likes of this star in my 48 years on earth.  I know Serius has been around for probally millions of years, but I never noticed it before that Nov 2003 night.  How i missed it, I don't know.  And what makes it appear to be flying in the sky,I don't know either. Well anyways, I have had my eye on the sky ever since, and let me tell you, that I have seen many unexplainable as well as unbelieveable strange flying stars in our skies over So. Cal. First of all, when you look up in the sky just after dark, there are 3 bright lights in the sky that always stay in a triangle formation.  They look just like bright stars,but if you've got a bit of patience, just sit down in a chair in a dark area,free from city lights, and watch those stars  Before long you're gunna notice that they are actually flying around in the sky.  They almost always stay within a certain radius from their original resting place, I've never seen them just take off and jam across the sky.  It's as if they have a certain area to guard and they stay within that area.  I've seen beams of light shoot out from these stars across the night sky for miles. Lately they have taken on a strange flouresent green hue, and when they fly they will luminize the whole sky around them which also turns flouresent green. Actually they are surrounded by vapor clouds and that's what lights up in the sky.  These clouds materalize and evaporate with the movement of these objects. The flying stars were observed all throughout this year. The color change took place in the middle of Nov. Will some of you see if you can see the same such mysterous objects in the sky over your own cities?? If you do, write a short discription of what YOU see here at this web site.  It'll be very interesting to hear other peoples stories about the flying stars and what YOU think they really are.  Thank You!!;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

4-5 circular white lights rotate around a circular orbit over part of Riverside.;2014-04-04 20:10:00;2 minutes;4 - 5 circular white lights rotate around a circular orbit over part of Riverside. As I was driving my car out of our garage, and down our drive way, a circular moving light in the sky caught my eye.   As I followed it with my eyes, there seem to be three or more white circular lights rotating around in a circle (like on an orbit path).  I thought of searchlights, but didnâ€™t see the typical stream of light.  I thought of a helicopter searchlight, but there seemed to be no aircraft nearby. As I drove on out of my neighborhood, I tried to identify where it may have come from.  I never figured it out.   Tonight, I googled a group of words, and found this website.  I read a listing for 4/3/2014 out in another city (I believe).  They have a similar listing.  That is why I thought I would report this one.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
I was driving N on I-215 and my 9 year old son shouted from the back, Mom, mom what the heck is that?;2017-03-17 18:20:00;8 seconds;I was driving North on I 215 and my 9 year old son shouted from the back &quot Mom, mom what the heck is that ... Mom look.&quot Unfo I was driving North on I 215 and my 9 year old son shouted from the back, Mom, mom what the heck is that?... Mom look.   Unfortunately, I was in heavy, fast moving traffic and just couldn't take my eyes off the road.  He watched a flat disc move at incredible speed across the length of the mountains.  He said, Mom, I know how fast a plane crosses that space.  It takes minutes, and that thing crossed in seconds - the whole mountain range and then just vanished.   He couldn't get over what he had seen.   I am soooo bummed I missed it.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
