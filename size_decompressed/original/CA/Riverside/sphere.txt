Red sphere with fire tail;2005-06-19 19:30:00;15mins;Red sphere with fire tail It was a huge sphere object with fire at the end. We thought it was an astroid because of the fire tail it had at the end we were waiting for it hit and expect something severe to happen as it was heading in the direction of the sun but as we can see it going down all of a sudden it change directions towards up again,at that point it was a dot but we did notice the sudden direction change going up again we lost sight of it because of the glare of the sun.  That night we waited to see the news on the object we saw but nothing was said. We seen green lights flying past or down from the sky before but this this was bright red, this was the first time we were afraid it was going to hit.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

I was able to watch it till it was out of sight,  A plane at very high altitude flew in close proximity much much higher than the clouds which made the object appear to fly at an extremely higher altitude.  I could not hear the engine of the plane nor the object.  I snapped a couple of pictures and the object with a 10 meg pix cannon, and the object shows up as a shimmering white sphere.   It has rained for a couple of days and today was very clear and crisp outside so visibility was almost perfect except for a couple of clouds.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

It then started to move vertical and side to side while changing colors.  The barbers at Getting Faded came outside and witnessed it all for themselves as well.  The object seemed to be near Moreno Valley and was flying west towards Los Angeles.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

Several amber orbs in the sky that had a plasma look to them;2016-08-12 19:15:00;05:00;Several amber orbs in the sky that had a plasma look to them My son and I were driving on Jurupa Ave between Grand Ave and Palm Ave.  My son who was 16 at the time said, Mom pull over, you have to look at this.  I looked out the window and saw several amber spheres that had a plasma look to them.  They seemed kind of low in the sky and were moving to the east.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone but my camera crashed when I tried.  By the time my phone came back on line the object was gone.  This image has stayed with me and I will never forget that night.   It took me years to report this because I didn't know a site like this existed and I feared people (other agencies) would make fun of me.  If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Fast moving orb craft over Southern California 10/07/2020.;2020-10-07 21:30:00;5 seconds;Fast moving orb craft over Southern California 10/07/2020. While in my backyard on the night of 10/07/2020 at approx. 21:30, while looking to the sky for meteors from The Orionids event, I witnessed an abnormal craft pass overhead. The sky was dark overhead with normal city light pollution toward the horizon. I had identified Saturn and Jupiter at approximately 192 degrees S of my position, then Mars at approximately 81 degrees E. I took out my phone and opened my “Star Walk 2” application to help identify any constellations I might be able to see. As I looked away from my phone and into the night sky while facing approximately 40 degrees NE, a fast moving, dull gray in color, orb appeared from approximately 109 degrees E and traveled toward 316 degrees NW. Estimating by relation to the commercial aircraft in the area at that time, the object appeared to be at approximately 20-25,000 feet in altitude. The orb shaped object appeared to be approximately one quarter the size of a commercial airliner (50 feet +/-) in diameter. The object had no flashing lights (of any color) and seemed to “glow” rather than “shine”. It traveled nearly the length of my visible sky in a straight line in approximately 4 seconds. At that 4th second, it made a 90 degree right angle maneuver traveled a split second, then made another 90 degree angle maneuver to the left (which put it back traveling in it’s original direction), before disappearing out of my sight another second later. There is high altitude commercial air traffic in my area, traveling to and from two large airports. These commercial aircraft were traveling approximately, at least, 5 times slower than the object I witnessed. The majority of the flight paths for these airports are perpendicular to the path of the unidentified object I witnessed. The commercial aircraft are easily identifiable by their colored lights, airspeed and direction. I regularly see the Starlink satellites and they too travel in a path perpendicular to this unidentified object, and approximately 100 times slower from my perspective. I immediately checked the viewable time for the International Space Station from my global position and found that it had possibly been visible (dependent on viewing conditions) albeit on a different flight path and approximately an hour and forty minutes earlier. The unidentified object I witnessed by my estimation was traveling at at least 2,000 mph, with no marker light, no sound, and no sonic boom.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
