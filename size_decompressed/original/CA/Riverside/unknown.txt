Red lights to the North during Patriot High fireworks;2016-07-03 21:10:00;10 minutes;Red lights to the North during Patriot High fireworks Watching fireworks display I saw a red light to my NW thought it was a helicopter until it stopped on a dime and hovered for a few minutes then moved in a manner uncharacteristic of a helicopter back to the SW a 100 feet then it continued to hover and move in a very smooth manner a number of times. It then went towards the NE and I lost sight behind trees as it moved from the area.  Too high for a drone too smooth for a helicopter and the manner of flight did not indicate a plane (which were in the area since we are on the flight path into Ontario airport)  Multiple people viewed and exclaimed that it was extraordinary.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Flashing object.;2017-09-10 10:00:00;15 minutes;Flashing object Sunday morning September 9, 2017, between 1000 hours and 1100 hours, I was working on a vehicle in my driveway, when I noticed movement in the sky to my north-west.  The flash(es) caught my attention as I thought it might be an aircraft making a turn and a reflection was off of a cockpit windscreen.  I watched an object at an elevation of estimated 5,000 to 8,000 feet moving from north to south.  The object moved at a consistent speed and elevation.  The weather was warm with full sun with a very light breeze, barely discernible from south to north, with light scattered clouds that the object moved through or behind in its track.  Flashing as it moved through the sky. I was able to retrieve a pair of binoculars to get a better visual on the object.  By this time my son and wife joined in the watching this unknown object and kept track of its location.  The object had stopped and was now stationary in the western sky for about 5 minutes.   With the binoculars, I could not discern its shape but the top and bottom portions were flashing separately and very brightly.  The object was emitting brilliant white flashes alternating from what I would describe the top half and bottom half of the object.  It appeared as though the two halves were rotating independently.  I was not able to determine shape. I looked away for about 10 seconds to adjust the binoculars and I lost sight of the object.   My son watched it as it moved abruptly to the west an undetermined distance and it was now, from my position, lower towards the horizon.  The object moved west until it was out of visual range.
