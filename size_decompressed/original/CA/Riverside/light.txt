Stationary star-like light suddenly disappears;2000-02-16 21:05:00;several minutes;Stationary star-like light suddenly disappears I was looking at the sky from my back porch. I noticed an unusual formation of two bright stars quite close to each other in the western sky. Just as I began to realize that I was seeing something out of the ordinary, one of the 'stars' suddenly blinked off. It took several seconds to completely fade out. It reminded me of a searchlight being turned off, where the filament can still be seen faintly glowing. I believe this is the same incident as the one listed for Seattle, WA. What eve it was must have been at great altitude. I'm glad someone else saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites also fade out as they enter the shadow of the Earth.  Hence, it is difficult for us to know what the individual may have seen.  PD));33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

Looking out north window below our jet, a light with no strobes was tracking our jet, after 10 minuted its light went out...no strobes..moon light reflected off object only. flew at same speed as jet, directly over I-10. I was in a flight from LA to phoenix, at around 8:45pm after reaching 33,000 feet I noticed a light following our jet. I was seated at the rear of the plane wing. wondering if this was an optical illusion I moved forward, and the light was blocked out by the rear-edge of our jet's wing. Therfore I could safely know this object was beneath us flying. Not just a reflection off my window. We were flying almost directly over I-10, and near Palm-Springs. This object almosy matched our planes speed, but after watching for nearly 10 minutes, I noticed it was actually a little slower, it was further from the edge of the wing fro my perspective. Then our jet made a slight path change, and went turned a little south. When our plane turned, the light kept going straight, so this further confirmed it was not a reflection. Then after about 30 seconds it corrected its course floowing our plane exactly, then it started speeding up, and was actually going faster, at which point the light went out on it. It had NO strobes, no lights whatsoever. I thought it had just dissappeared, but as I looked I could actually see a very faint blue light where it had been, I could track this light over the surrounding lights from I-10/city, it was more like reflected moon-light possibly, it then sped up and I lost visual of the object when our planes wing was in the way. There were many other planes in the sky that night, I was in a Boeing 737, which means I was traveling around 500-600 MPH, this was NOT a small plane. All other planes in the sky that night both above, and below our altitude had strobes. Our plane had strobes. This object was bright, one light, travelling far beneath our altitude, and between 500-600 mph over I-10 eastbound. I would really like to know what in the world it was. Do military aircraft fly low, and black/no strobes? -((name deleted));33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

On my way to work in the early morning hours, I looked up at the sky and I saw bright red, green, and a yellowish orange circle of lights. I swirved off the road as I was trying to get a good look at it. I then pulled over on the 60 freeway going westbound, and just stared at these lights. It was so bright I could not make out what it was, but it was a circle of lights, and it was just sitting still in the sky. I sat there for about 10 minutes, and decided to head on out to work. As I got to work, I started feeling sick, and began to vomit. I decided to go back home, but I did not see the lights when I was heading home. I felt sick for the remainder of the day. I never told anyone of what I had seen. I did not think anyone would believe me.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Bright white light moving west to east, faster than commercial jet;2004-02-07 18:05:00;about 45 sec;Bright white light moving west to east, faster than commercial jet I was stading on my back porch looking at the evening sky, when my attention was drawn to a bright light almost directly overhead. The light was slightly to the west when I first noticed it. It looked like a bluish white large planet (I don't know anything about astronomy, I just like to look at the sky), but I noticed that it was moving to the east. It appeared to be quite high, and was moving quite a bit faster than a commercial aircraft, but definitely slower than a meteor. The light continued going east, and I watched it until it disappeared behind some trees in the distance (almost to the eastern horizon.) The light did not flash or flicker like an exhaust or reflected light, it seemed to be self-luminous. It did not leave a trail behind like a missile or meteor. I did not see any red or green navigation lights as it departed to the east, which I would have expected it it were an aircraft. It is unusual to see any air traffic going directly west to east from this location. Riverside is under the approach for LA and Orange County airports, and there were numerous jetliners in the sky at the same time, all going from east to west, or from NE to SW for Orange County. All had easily seen red and green navigation lights and strobing white lights in addition to their landing lights. The object was noticeably different that the jetliners in appearance. There were faint jet engine noise heard, but it was probably related to the commercial aircraft going overhead at the same time.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

It was a very clear sky lots of stars.  Driving down the 91 freeway south of the 60 freeway when to my eleven o'clock a green neon light a sphere, just appears for about two maybe three seconds then just blasted across the sky,  It looked like something out of star wars it was amazing, the reason that I'm reporting this now is that it happened very very close to March Air Force Base might have been above it and low very low.  I thought it was the air force with their jet with the laser that shoots down missiles but recently i seen the documentary on that jet and their laser is not neon green and does not shoot out the way this did.  It's been over four years but it seems like yesterday.   Well I'm not saying it was something from outer space but as an ex marine what i saw that night was impressive.

Bright Rotating Light In Night Sky;2005-06-14 03:00:00;30 - 40 minutes;Bright Rotating Light In Night Sky One bright rotating hovering light which would change colors (white/blue/red ... possibly more, but so far away) on the backdrop of a night sky with no moon.  Very far off in the distance west of my home, perhaps over Ontario or Chino, California.  Standing in my backyard stoop it moved southwest at first - movement seemed slow and not blatantly noticeable until all of a sudden I had to walk down the back steps to see it beyond my neighbors large tree and then it seemed to move northwest so that I had to reposition myself to the kitchen window to see it again.  The whole occurence lasted aproximately 30 minutes with the object eventually moving west beyond my line of sight.  While still watching the object, an early morning scheduled flight (I've seen and timed it before while letting my dogs out in the backyard to do their business)crossed west to east just south of my home confirming what I was seeing was not an airplane.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Bright, fast moving light passes overhead;2007-08-03 20:00:00;1 min approx.;Bright, fast moving light passes overhead About 2030 hours 08/03/2007 I was sitting on my back porch facing east, looking at the night sky. The sky was cloudless and unusually clear for my urban location. I had just watched several satellites pass overhead, when I noticed a light low in the southern sky. At first I thought it was another satellite however it seemed a lot brighter and faster than the ones I had just been watching. The object was going from South to North and appeared to be at great altitude. Numerous general aviation and commercial aircraft were visible at the same time. The object appeared to be self luminous instead of reflecting sunlight, as it had an unusual blue/purple tinge similar to an electric welding torch. The object passed almost directly overhead of my location, continuing North until I lost sight of it behind the roofline of my house. The light maintained a straight course the entire time I could see it, traversing the sky from where I first saw it to where I lost sight of it in approximately one minute or so. Shortly before I lost sight of the object it blinked out and lit up again in a regular pattern about three times, going dark for several seconds. I checked the Heavens Above site and could find no info about any satellites passing overhead at that time. I also watched the next few nights to see if the object would reappear and I did see the satellites I had seen that night, but no sign of the bright, fast moving object.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Bright flash followed by glowing, blinking object;2008-08-02 21:30:00;1 minute approx.;Bright flash followed by glowing, blinking object On 08/02/2008 about 2130 I was sitting on my back porch, looking at the sky. My attention was drawn by a very bright flash, like a photographic flash, to the southwest. When the flash dissipated, there was a glowing white object in the spot where the flash originated. The object looked like a large satellite, blinking on and off in an irregular pattern glowing brightly for about a second then dimming to complete darkness for one to several seconds. My first impression was that it was some type of satellite which was rotating and reflecting the sun, but I would imagine that the pattern of flashes would be at a more consistent interval. The object continued flashing on and off for about a minute. By connecting the locations where the object was glowing, it made a shallow ‘S’ shaped path, finally disappearing to the northwest. I checked the Heavens Above site for iridium flares and other objects which would account for this sighting, but I could not find anything for that time frame and location in the sky.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

The sky was clear and visibility good. I noticed a white light moving from the northwest towards the east. I first thought it was a satellite, but soon noticed it was much larger and brighter than any satellite I have ever seen. It was brilliant white, brighter and larger than Venus which was also visible in the southern sky. The light’s speed was similar to a high altitude commercial aircraft, and it changed it course slightly several times while I watched, finally arcing towards the southeast. I watched the light until it disappeared in the distance. The light’s brightness remained constant for the duration of the sighting.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

My attention was drawn to an extremely bright, round object approaching from the south.  At first I thought it was a satellite, but it was too large, bright and fast.  The object was circular, bluish white in color, with a faint reddish corona-type effect around it.  Its’ speed was too fast for a satellite and too slow for a meteor.  The object’s brightness remained the same as it passed overhead, traveling from south to north.  It did not flicker, sparkle or leave a trail as a meteor would and it made no sound.  There were commercial and general aviation aircraft in the sky at the time, and the object seemed to be much higher than the aircraft.  I watched it until it disappeared behind some scattered clouds that were forming to the north-east of my location.  The object changed its course slightly to the east just before it disappeared for good.  I saw an identical object about a month ago, following the same general path, but I was busy at the time and did not make note of the date or time.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

On the night before Halloween me and my girlfriend had come outside to my backyard, we were going about our conversation when a blue and orange light caught my eye and I had said to my girlfriend “What the ____!“ and pointed. The orange light was stationary and the blue light would movie 180 degrees back and forth on the left of the orange light. The two lights would dim in and out and the blue light would sometimes disappear. I live at a base of a small hill and the lights seemed to be right above the ground over the hill, I ran inside to get some binoculars thinking maybe I could get somewhat of a glimpse of what it could be and I focus the binoculars and point them toward the hill and the two lights zoomed from the stationary position to I guess you could say, light speed, faster than any machine or human can run.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Light blue object, suddely turns brilliant white, leaves trail and wake;2010-06-17 21:33:00;2 min approx;Light blue object, suddely turns brilliant white, leaves trail and wake On 06/17/2010 at 2133 hours I was on my back porch, looking at the sky before going to bed.  There were no clouds, but there was some haze near the ground.  I noticed a light blue object approaching from the South which I at first took to be a satellite.  As I watched, I noticed it was moving much faster than any satellite I have ever seen.  The object continued going North, passing overhead slightly to the East of my location.  Suddenly the object went from medium intensity light blue to brilliant white, and its size seemed to increase substantially.  It was not a gradual transition as with an iridium satellite, but instantaneous, as it something had switched on.  About a second after it turned white, it began making a conical shaped wake which spread out from the object and dissipated.  The object itself began leaving a thin, white trail behind it as well. After several seconds, the brilliant white light, wake and trail went off, and the object returned to its lig! ht blue form.  After a few more seconds, it briefly switched to brilliant white again, but this time no wake or trail were visible.  The object returned to light blue and remained that way until I lost sight of it as it went behind the roof line of my house to the North.  The object was on a straight flight path the entire time, going from South to North.  It seemed to wobble a bit after it started making the wake and trail.  At the time of this sighting, there were satellites and various types of aircraft visible in the sky.  I did not hear any noise that seemed to be related to the object. I did hear jet aircraft but I am sure the source was from airliners passing overhead.  I watched the sky during the same time period for the next two days to see if it could have been some type of satellite, but I did not see anything similar.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Brilliant green object, seems to launch smaller white objetc;2010-07-31 21:52:00;10 sec approx;Brilliant green object, seems to launch smaller white objetc On 07/31/2010 I was on my back porch looking at the sky.  The sky was clear with just a few scattered clouds. I had originally gone out to see what was happening, as about an hour earlier, a pair of Blackhawk helicopters were circling the area, extremely low with only their battle lights on.  I ended up looking at the stars after they left.  At 2152 hrs I noticed what seemed to be a satellite approaching from the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was moving rather slow for a satellite and moving towards the northwest.  It started as a dim white color but began increasing in size and intensity.  Just when I thought I was about to see a good iridium flare, I realized that instead of flaring and then subsiding, this object was continuing to increase in size and brilliance.  It became huge, larger and brighter than Saturn visible to the west, and the color was now an unusual shade of light green around the edge and brilliant white in the center.  It appeare! d to be self-illuminated and not reflecting the sun.  It remained at its brightest for several seconds, then it suddenly went completely dark for a fraction of a second, then returned with full brilliance.  Concurrent with this display, I noticed a small, white object shooting off to the west at a slight downward angle.  The white object looked like a small, very slow meteor leaving a short trail.  It appeared slightly below the green object and quite a bit to the right of it, but the trajectory of the white object in relation to the green object gave me the impression it had shot out from it. (It is possible that it was just a meteor as there was nothing unusual about it other than its appearance and proximity to the green object.)  The green object, after re-appearing, remained illuminated for a about a second, then rapidly diminished in size and became completely dark. It did not just blink off but seemed to power down. At 2202 hrs., I saw a two more objects one after another, almost directly overhead going from south to north. They performed similarly to the large green object, but did not become as bright and they remained white in color.  They too grew in intensity, flashed on and off several times and then went dark.  I checked the Heavens Above website and discovered that there were NO iridium satellites visible from my location on that date, and the other known objects that were visible were not overhead at the times or locations of these sightings.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Two bright lights overhead, travelling S to N;2011-08-02 22:04:00;30 seconds + -;Two bright lights overhead, travelling S to N On 08/02/2011, I was sitting on my back porch looking at the sky.  The night was clear, no haze and normal air traffic was abundant.  I saw numerous regular satellites passing overhead as well.   About 2204 hours I noticed a light appear about 45 degrees above the horizon to the south.  At first, I thought it was an iridium satellite, as it grew in intensity and size to a brilliant yellowish color.   About 1 to 2 seconds later, a second object appeared behind the first, following the exact path of the first.   The objects were separated by a space which was approximately the width of my thumb at arms' length.  The second object got increasingly brighter, surpassing the brilliance of the first by a small margin.  Unlike iridium satellites, these two objects remained at peak illumination for maybe 5 to 10 seconds before fading.   My impression is that the objects were self-illuminated and not reflecting the Sun.   Both objects seemed to veer slightly to the northwest as they passed overhead.  Both objects faded out one after the other and could not be seen anymore.  I checked the Heavens Above website and discovered that there were no iridium satellites or other man made objects in the vicinity at the time of my sighting.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
White dot flying at high speed on Labor Day evening in Riverside, CA;2011-09-05 22:30:00;4 seconds;White dot flying at high speed on Labor Day evening in Riverside, CA I was outside in my back yard, facing west, with moderate lighting off to the left of me, but not glaring nor directly in my line of vision.  To my right, which was very dark, I saw what I thought was a falling star so I looked to it quickly to view it.  My sister-in-law saw it too and at first thought we were going to see a falling star.  In the 2nd second and on, we focused our vision on it and instead of seeing it burn out, we saw it was a round ball of bright white light with a short, comet-like tail streaming behind it.  The tail was slightly shorter than what you see on a falling star and of the same white color as the round light that it trailed.  It flew across the sky traveling from north to south in a perfectly horozontal line, at an altitude lower than any airplane in our area and faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen.  It made no sound of any sort.  I am familiar with aircraft, helicopters and military aircraft and have been to several air shows and seen an assortment of aircraft fly but this was much faster and made no sound.  We watched it for about 3 seconds (plus the second that we saw it in our perifrial vision when we thought it was a falling star) then lost sight of it as it passed in front of my house.  We ran to the south side to watch it continue on but we never saw it again.  It looked just like the craft seen in the Lake Elsinor ufo video earlier this year and Lake Elsinor is not too far from here.  March Air Force Base is directly to the east of me, about 7 miles away and this is no like anything that flies from there, much, much faster that any plane I have ever seen, silent and didn't have the flashing aircraft lights.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

The first three flew in a triangular formation, one in front, two behind.  Called my wife out to have a look.  We watched as 5 more passed by at approximately one minute intervals on same trajectories.  Tried to view with binoculars, but red light too bright.  Flew right over March ARB, which is restricted airspace.  Stayed well away from commercial flight paths, of which there are several in this area, e.g., Ontario and John Wayne approach. Note:  these must have been some type of aircraft conforming to aviation rules, which require a red light on a left wing.  But the brightness of the light made them seem to be very close, ½ mile or less, while completely silent and very fast.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

Pair of white light balls rapidly fade in and out, over Riverside City, Southern California.;2016-07-29 21:49:00;10;Pair of white light balls rapidly fade in and out, over Riverside City, Southern California. At approximately 21:49 (I checked my phone, after the event), while swimming, in our pool, my wife and I witnessed two very large balls of pure white light following one another, about 3 seconds apart. They appeared as two low points of light, travelling South, in a straight line, grew very bright in intensity, then faded rapidly. My wife told me, I wouldn't have believed you, if I hadn't seen them, myself. These objects appeared to be in atmosphere and well above normal commercial aircraft traffic (all air traffic is East West, in this airspace).  No blinking, or colored lights. Oddly enough, I've seen single balls of light, on the same trajectory, about once a month, for the past 2 years.  This was odd, to see two lights, following one another.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Strange orb looking lights floating across night sky in California;2017-04-01 20:18:00;10 minutes;Strange orb looking lights floating across night sky in California My cousins & I were sitting outside when she noticed a few lights in the sky floating across in the same direction.  They looked like orbs just floating across sky but there were so many and they made no noise like that of an aircraft.  They did not blink or have any flashing light  but just seemed to disappear.  They looked like white lights floating.  I have video of it to at a certain time frame a light or something below these lights is seen streaking thru the sky below them.  I can't find anything online as far as anyone else seeing this or an explanation.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Pulsing red light, changes colors & altitude.;2017-07-08 22:50:00;1 minute;Pulsing red light, changes colors & altitude. On the night of July 8, 2017, my wife called my attention to a red ball of light  approximately 20 miles away, to the West. The light was bright red and pulsing bright & dim.  It hovered, then rapidly ascended straight up.  On the way up, it changed color from red, to blue, to pale yellow, orange, then back to red, when it stopped. It hovered a few moments, then remained red and slowly descended, below the horizon. The entire event lasted about one minute. The light was incredibly bright, for as far away as it was.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Light with a trail over Riverside.;2018-02-25 21:00:00;30 seconds;Light with a trail over riverside The object in question was a blue light.  At first, I believed this to be a star, but when I noticed a trail behind it, I knew it was something else.  Especially at the height that it was, with two planes under it for reference,  I knew that it had to be much higher.   Another thing was that for the height that it was, it seemed to be flying pretty fast.  Almost seemed to be outpacing the passenger plane under it.   The point is, I saw this light, it had a trail behind it that crossed once, like a jet propelled aircraft, it was way too high and fast for it to be a regular passenger plane, and I cant find any information about it on the internet.  I don't think it was a jet either. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512

They were In a line formation but apart prob a couple hundred yards.  Saw these move across  The sky for almost an hour so was way over 50-60 of these.  Checked to see if they were satellites but didn’t see online that any where over my area at the time.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
