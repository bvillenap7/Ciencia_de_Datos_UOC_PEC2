Tubular shaped object at high altitude over souther calif;1990-06-30 13:00:00;4:00;Tubular shaped object at high altitude over souther calif What I saw was tube shaped with flat ends the color was a pale white.  It was at what appeared to be very high altitude.  I could see shadowing with some contrast,it remained stationary for about four hours.  There were two other people who observed it. I was able to look at it with a pair of field glasses while laying on my back.  This thing was in some sort of geo sync. I watched it untill it faded from view due to diminishing daylight.  It never moved, it remained fixed in one position above my location.  It slowly faded from view while never moving.  Again it appeared to remain at a stationary point, but must have been in the atmosphere at high altitude because as daylight waned it slowly faded with the approaching dusk ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
White object seen flying north to south, reflecting sunlight.;2004-11-01 11:40:00;30 seconds;White object seen flying north to south, reflecting sunlight. On 11/01/04 I was going for my daily walk. The sky was blue and clear, with strong, gusty winds. About 11:40, I noticed a white object appear above the treeline in front of me. At first, I thought it was a toy balloon or maybe a plastic bag that had been blown aloft by the wind. It became apparent that the object was not being tossed about by the wind, but was proceeding from north to south, straight as an arrow and contrary to the wind direction. It passed almost directly overhead, reflecting the sunlight as it passed. It appeared to be shiny, opaque white, not self-luminous. There were no wings, fins or other protrusions visible. The shape was a short tube with rounded ends, like a vitamin capsule or maybe an aircraft drop tank. I watched it until it disappeared in the distance to the south. I estimate that it was at least several tbousand feet high, as there were jetliners visible in the sky at the same time on approach to LAX and Ontario airport. The airliners appeared much higher that the object. The speed of the object reminded me of a military jet making a pass at an airshow, fast but not supersonic. There was no noticeable noise from the object, but there was a lot of background noise due to the wind in the trees. At one point, the object passed over, or maybe through, a cloud of dust which has been carried aloft by the wind, and it appeared to either make a wake throught it or cast a shadow on it as it passed.

Round Cylinder shaped craft, being chased by 2 fighter jets.;2014-09-12 05:30:00;20 minutes;Round Cylinder shaped craft, being chased by 2 fighter jets. Okay, I am reporting what was reported by several Riverside County citizens over the 91/215/60 freeway interchange this morning about 5:45 a.m.   There is a UTUBE video posted by one Tim Kaiser, with a cylinder being chased by 2 airforce jets.  It's real.  I tried to send the UTUBE to your UFO site, but could not figure out how to do it.  Is it posted on my Facebook Timeline Page.  If you would like to contact me, I can share it with a site you identify.  This is really amazing video.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
