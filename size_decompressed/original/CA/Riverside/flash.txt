Unidentified patch of light in the night sky;1988-09-20 03:00:00;6-7 seconds;Unidentified patch of light in the night sky This event occurred somtime in September of 1988, I don't recall the exact date at this time. I was working as a school district police officer and was sitting in the middle of one of the high school campuses, writing on my patrol log. I had the window of my truck down and was using the illumination from a security light on one of the nearby buildings to write by. The sky was clear, stars visible, no moonlight that I recall. Suddenly, the interior of my truck lit up like it was daylight. My first impression was that a truck with off-road lights had pulled up behind me and suddenly turned on all its' lights at once. This startled me quite a bit, as I did not hear anything, even with the window down. I looked up from my writing and into the rear view mirror, only to discover there was nothing there. I considered the possiblity of a police helicopter shining its' spotlight on me, but there was no helicopter noise. Also, the spotlight from a helicopter has a blue-ish tinge to it, and has an oscillating effect due to the vibrations from the rotors. There was no sense that the light source was moving, and it was white light, like daylight. I looked out the window into the sky to try and locate the source. As I looked around, I saw an irregular patch of white light in the sky to the northeast, about 40 degrees above the horizon. The shape was roughly elliptical, but had ragged edges. The patch of light seemed to be closing in on itself, and it disappeared as I watched it. The size of the patch when I first saw it was about 4 or 5 times larger that the full moon, but much brighter. I checked the newspapers for the next several weeks to see if there was any mention of meteors or other events which would explain what I saw, but nothing ever appeared. I grew up near several airports and a military aircraft factory, and am familiar with conventional aircraft. While I am not an amateur astronomer, I like to look at the sky for relaxation, and have seen various types of meteors and bolides. I have seen countless missile launches from Vandenberg AFB, and have been watching satellites since Echo 1. I have never seen anything like this before or since.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
Large flash, bright streak in the sky;2008-08-02 22:32:00;2-3 seconds;Large flash, bright streak in the sky On 08/02/2008 about 2232 I was sitting on my back porch, looking at the sky, when I saw an extremely bright white flash low in the sky to the south of my location.  After the flash I saw a large, wide trail streaking towards the southwest.  The trail was yellowish in color, with green towards the leading edge.  After the flash and trail disappeared, there were two parallel gray streaks which lasted for several seconds.  It didnâ€™t look like any meteor or fireball I have ever seen, maybe space debris re-entering?  It looked more like some type of exhaust trail or plume from a missile.   I checked the local paper and the internet for any other reports, all I could locate was the following entry in an astronomy message board. Maybe someone can identify what TV station the person is talking about. Object crashed by Ca. border last night. Just heard on the news that an object was observed, looking much like a meteor, but changing directions, then hit the ground. News reported within sixteen minutes a bevy of military helicopters appeared, one being a large carrier that picked up the item, still glowing, and left due north towards Vegas. Anyone hear, see, know anything about this?  Wondering if the Riverside group that's having a Star Party this weekend saw it.;33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
2  Large Flashes of Light Seen in Riverside,CA 10:15pm 8/28/011;2011-08-28 23:15:00;4 seconds;2  Large Flashes of Light Seen in Riverside,CA 10:15pm 8/28/011 At 10:15pm tonight,I was sitting outside smoking a cigarette(facing East)when right before my eyes I saw what looked like two huge flashes of light on the horizon.  My best example of this would be when a really strong hurricane, or gusts of wind knock out the transformers and you see large,green flashes of light.  That's basically what I saw(and trust me,we deal with the Santa Ana's out here) one after another, but they weren't green. They were a light bluish hue,and dimmed to white on the outer edges of the flashes.  Lasted about 2-4 seconds?  One flash right after the other,BAM-BAM (didn't make any noise though)   Hope someone else out there saw it too, I think it was in the direction of Downtown Riverside?  Hope that helps!:);33.9480238705754;-117.413760378512
