It started to move slowly then would stop then move faster.  Next we saw several others in the same area doing the same thing only not as bright as the original one.  they would flicker, dim in and out, and move fast and slow. ( all in the same general area).  they all seemed to disappear at once.;34.3918;-118.9154
