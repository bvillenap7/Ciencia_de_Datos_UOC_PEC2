Reddish-purple fireball seen above Fillmore, Ca. on a Sunday night.;2014-06-22 20:30:00;5-7 minutes;Reddish-purple fireball seen above Fillmore, Ca. on a Sunday night. Was driving back home in Fillmore from work around 8:40 pm on Sunday night.  I parked my car on the side of the street when i saw a strange purple/red light high in the sky.  The color was unlike any I have seen before, it was almost glistening slightly like a star would and it also emitted with its colors like a fireball, with what i believe to be blue and red, (giving it the purple color maybe?) and it was moving too slow be to a plane.  Actually, my brother told me that he and his friends also saw the same object but from a different part of town but they were much closer and he said that it was reddish-purple and round like a circle. While I was parked watching this object it got behind a tree that was blocking my view of it, even though i was still able to see some of it through the tree leaves.  After a few minutes i got out of my car and walked in front of the tree because i hadn't seen the object move past it.  By the time i got there it was gone. I never saw it leave, it just vanished even though I had kept my eyes glued to see through the leaves and the empty space around the tree.;34.3918;-118.9154
