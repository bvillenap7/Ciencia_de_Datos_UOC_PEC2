V shape to U shape object in Sky April 2003 this item was hugh!;2003-04-30 04:00:00;30 minutes;V shape to U shape object in Sky April 2003 this item was huge! One ship, night sky early morning hours around four o'clock. At first I thought it was the international space station I could not see the craft but what I did see was lights in the shape of a V to a U, I watch object for upwards to 30 minutes  so I knew it was not an airplain, and when it started making a long 90 degree turn I knew that it was not the space station. At first the direction was from west to east, and after the 90 degree turn it was heading north. The altitude must have been at least sixty miles plus in order to be in my view for such a period of time. So it could have been a spy satellite but if it was it was a hugh one. And there was no noise what so ever. Also have a sighting tht took place in essex, amboy california in 1994 this is a very interesting story filled with witnesses. If interested let me know ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));33.9526000000001;-116.968
