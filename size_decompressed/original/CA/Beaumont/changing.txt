black grayish thing  ((NUFORC Note:  May not be a serious report, but we are not certain.  PD));2003-08-16 23:00:00;10 minutes;black grayish thing me and my friend just got back from watching freddy versus jason at the theatre and we were sitting on the fence looking at the full moon (it was big and bright) and we were talking about mars i don't know why but i told him that scout ships were going to be comming to check out the earth, a couple of minutes later i turned to my right and saw something that caught my attention i told my friend look!! and he jumped over to see he said oh my god how did you see that it was across the street from us about 30-40' long, black no lights or sound about 20-30' above the house across the street from his, he ran into the house and told everyone him and his nephew came out with binoculars as it was flying from west to east (you can walk faster than it was moving)i told my friend to look at the leafs in the tree there not moving (so it wasn't wind propelled)as it turned and went northeast it fliped 180 degrees and went towards the mountains it was black with dark gray as it went under the moon there was no reflection of light from the moon on the object it proceeded northeast untill it disapeard out of sight. then 10 minutes later a helicopter went out from the west but a little northern from us and i told my friend take notice helicopters don't fly into the mountains at night a couple of minutes later what appeard to be a falling star went into the same area as the strange craft and the helicopter i just want to know what is going on. is it really what me and my friend think it is because i really think it is extraterestrial and i can't tell if it's good or evil (because it was dark no sound no light's.) it looked like it was looking right at us as it was floating by before it did the flip and started going towards the mountain ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, althought the witness, who elects to remain totally anonymous, does not indicate that fact.  We wonder whether this is a serious report, or not.  PD));33.9526000000001;-116.968
