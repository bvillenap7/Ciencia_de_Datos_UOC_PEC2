I saw what looked like an embryo lit up in bright red light fly by heading west.;2013-02-22 19:10:00;minute;Driving home on the 10 fry near my home in Beaumont, first I saw what looked like an embryo lit up in bright red light fly by heading west, right after that I saw a octagon shaped ufo glide over ubove our cars to my left it was dark grey with white ligts.  I was looking up at it so I saw it's underside.   Several cars saw it, slowing down, a couple of cars pulled over.    In less then a mi. I got off at my off ramp and pulled over.  I wanted to get a picture, but my camera was at home.  Plus I no longer could see it.   As I proceeded toward my neighborhood I saw what looked like a long strings of red light which would change to white lights, similar to what I had seen about 2 yrs ago with my friend.   I only wish I had a picture.   Maybe next time;33.9526000000001;-116.968
