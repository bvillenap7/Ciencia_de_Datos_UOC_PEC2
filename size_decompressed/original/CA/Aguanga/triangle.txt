I went outside to lock up my shed. Moving east to west, appeared three large, white lights, slowly moving closer in my direction. Before passing over and south of my location, I could see three objects, triangular in shape, dark in color with pulsating red lights on the v-shaped wings. There was no sound at this point. I ran back in the house, I grabbed my wife's phone off the charging doc, told her to follow me and ran out the front door. At this point , the three aircraft were slighly west of my home and moving Northwest, deeper into Riverside County. They used engines because I could now hear the engine thrust after passing by. I was able to capture a video but only the lights can be seen and not the design of these objects. First sighting for me.;33.4473;-116.7997
