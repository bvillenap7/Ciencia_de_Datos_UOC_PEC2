I was standing outside smoking, looking north. I noticed a point of light as bright as Venus, halfway between Polaris and the horizon.  As I watched, the light moved very slightly eastward and, while moving, faded from a bright point of light to nothing.  I moved to the right then to the left, thinking that my view might have been obscured by a couple of spindly palm trees which were there. I never saw the light after it faded.  I saw no airplane lights at any time and there are no stars that bright in that part of the sky.;33.4473;-116.7997
