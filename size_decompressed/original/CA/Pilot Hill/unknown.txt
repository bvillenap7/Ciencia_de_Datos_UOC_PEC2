At first I went outside to observe it. Then I decided to go upstairs and search for some binoculars.

I had the object sighted in with the smaller locating scope and when I went to find it on the big scope it was gone.  I looked back up and the light was completely gone.   The light was approximately 600 to 1000 feet off the ground judging from the trees in the horizon.;38.817;-121.0328
