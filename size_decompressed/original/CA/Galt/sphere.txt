large ball with green light outside and red and orange inside with red circle in the middle.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));2004-07-17 04:00:00;1 1\2 hours;large ball with green light outside and red and orange inside with red circle in the middle. On July 17 2004 around 4:00am  Me and my husband and our two friends were having a get together playing cards and what not when we went out side for a smoke I saw a large bright light in the sky at first I thought it was a plane but it was not moving it stayed in one place so we got out a telescope and a video camara and starting taping it when we saw it on video it was round and it looked like little nucular explosions on the inside it move from side to side up and down it was moving closer to us then it would move futher away. thought the telescope it looked like small molecules like looking through a petree dish at a virus or something it had like a green light around the outside and red and orange explosions inside the circle with a solid red circle in the middle of the red and orange. As the sun began to come up it got futher and further away. I have not seen it since and the was no report of any thing in the news I'm not sure what I saw but it was not like anything I have seen before. Shortly after this like 10 or 15 min. our friends two dogs dissappeard out of thier yard and ten turkeys appeared in the front yard we did not see them apear or go away when the dogs came to the back door the turkeys were gone. not sure if it has anything to do with this sighting it was just kind of strange. I have a video but I'm afraid to show it. Not sure if it is safe to report this but I need to know if I'm crazy and if I'm not then what is out there............ ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses might have been looking at a twinkling star, or perhaps Venus in the eastern sky, but that is only a guess on our part.  PD));38.2723;-121.2976
