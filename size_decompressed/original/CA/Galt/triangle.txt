Black triangle with rounded edges with bright round lights near each corner, crossed over freeway I-5 April 30th at 9:40 PM .;2009-04-30 21:40:00;10 min;Black triangle with rounded edges with bright round lights near each corner, crossed over freeway I-5 April 30th at 9:40 PM . I was driving south on I-5 South of Elk Grove and North of Lodi.  At 9:35 PM I spotted a bright light in sky near the  western horizon (to my left).  I watched as the light got brighter and bigger. It was travelling due East.  I slowed my car to try to intercept the crossing of I-5.  As it got closer I notice there were three bright lights within a triangular craft.  I parked my car off the edge of the freeway as I felt I was directly in the path.  It slowly passed directly over my vehicle and myself. I estimate it was about 1000 ft. (I served 8 years in the 82nd Airborne with over 200 parachute jumps.  We jumped from 1000 feet so I know estimate the craft at the same height).  It was large, black, tringular with rounded corners.  It had extremely bright headlights.  It was flat, with several small white lights where jet engines might be located.  It crossed the freeway and headed due west. No noise what so ever.  I had a very clear unubstructed view.  There is no lights, houses, buildings or trees on that section of the highway.;38.2723;-121.2976
