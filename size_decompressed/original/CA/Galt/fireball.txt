I saw a big ball of light fall straight down, hang for a moment then zip straight back up the way it came.;2007-11-10 00:30:00;5 seconds;I saw a big ball of light fall straight down, hang for a moment then zip straight back up the way it came. I was driving north on Elliot Road toward the intersection of Jahant at around 12:30 AM the morning of November 10th, 2007.  A large, very bright ball of light dropped down into my field of vision in my windshield on the driver's side. It just hung there in the sky for several seconds before it suddenly zipped straight back up into the sky the same way it had come. It happened very fast. I stopped and leaned out to see if I saw it in the sky anywhere but it was totally gone. In my windshield, it was probably about the size of a big headlight but the light was very defined, edges not blurry at all. Not a very good comparison but that's about how big it looked.  I've seen this once before sometime around the fall of 1977. I was lying on my back in the pasture with the horses one night around 8:00 in the evening. I was looking up at the sky when suddenly a similar ball of light appeared to fall straight down into my field of vision. It hung there for a few seconds, then it started to move straight back up slowly. I sat up because I started to get a little scared. All of a sudden it took off almost straight back up but angled off to the right a little bit. Then it just disappeared. I lived in Mississippi then.;38.2723;-121.2976
