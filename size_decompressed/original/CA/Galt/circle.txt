A silent  , fast moving, translucent object was observed by 30 people.;2004-07-04 19:30:00;2 minutes;A silent  , fast moving, translucent object was observed by 30 people. We were watching fire works when a round shaped object appeared. It was traveling a pretty fast pace, but did not make noise. The object was clear but seemed to have lights inside of it, almost like a jelly fish. There were also yellow lights on the bottom of the object. A group of about 30 people witnessed the event.  We had seen several aircraft in the area flying at about the same height and their engines were heard clearly, the object we seen was silent.  The object flew from west to east on a straight line, the altitude & direction never changed. If it had been a balloon or radio controlled device, it could have never flown like the object did.  We do have a flight path over the site, but it is south to north, not west to east. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We would like to correspond with the witness, and we would welcome reports from the other witnesses.  PD));38.2723;-121.2976

I saw between 6 and 8 objects moving in formation across the night sky.;2017-01-01 02:30:00;8 seconds;I saw between 6 and 8 objects moving in formation across the night sky. I was observing the night sky on January 1st, 2017, between 2:30 am and 3:00 am, when I saw 6-8 lights about the size of Venus in formation traveling West across the sky.   The formation was about the size of the moon and took approximately 8 seconds from when I seen the objects, to where I couldn't see them anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite serious-minded.  We suspect he is a quite reliable witness.  PD));38.2723;-121.2976
