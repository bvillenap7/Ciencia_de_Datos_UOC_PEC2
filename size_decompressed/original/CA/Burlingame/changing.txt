In a few minutes it changed to a bright glowing oval shape with a slight dome and blinking lights at the top and bottom. At first I thought it was a blimp but it was so brightly glowing. I thought how could it be it was night and dark outside. Did I see a blimp or what. After it hovered over the freeway it tipped to the east. I left the freeway and spotted it over the bay as a fuzzy almost round shape. I would like to know what I saw.  An easy explanation would be a blimp that was lighted in some way.  We do have blimps up at times but that have bold lettering easily seen but this was not evident.  I didn't know who the ask maybe you can supply information.;37.5671901408451;-122.365621126761
