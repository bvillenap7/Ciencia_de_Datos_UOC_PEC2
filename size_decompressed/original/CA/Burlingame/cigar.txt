I was on my way to Albertsons grocery store when I happened to glance up to the hills that crest over the Peninsula area and noticed what I thought to be a huge water tower on the top of the hill line. I was somewhat confused because I'd never noticed it before, and I'm a very observant person. I drove on while keeping my eyes on the object as best I could. I pulled into the Albertson's parking lot. I was able to see the object very clearly.  It was NOT a water tower! I'd estimate that it was perhaps only 6 blocks from me at the most, and by judging the size of the trees it was hovering over I'd estimate it's size at anywhere from 50 feet to 75 feet. As I watched, it began moving very slowly down from the tree line towards me.  It had to have been only 20-30 at the most above the houses.  The object then began to move slowly towards the left.  I noticed that at first the object was very stark and clear, but as it began to move to the left the front edge/side seemed to become blurry/indistinct on the leading edge (in the direction of travel).  It slowly went behind some buildings which is when I lost sight of it. What seemed to me to be the most interesting aspect of all this is that NO ONE ELSE SEEMED TO NOTICE!!! and yet, there it was as big as life for everyone to see.  This was a VERY solid, metallic looking (lead colored) object with no apparent windows, wings, engines. It made absolutely no noise that I could hear.  I began checking all the local papers for the next three weeks...nothing!  That's my story! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
