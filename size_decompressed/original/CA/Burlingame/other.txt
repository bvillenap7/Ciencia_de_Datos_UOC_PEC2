I was in the back yard of my house smokeing a cigarett looking into the night sky.  The weather had been rainy but it had cleared up.  Then in the north-eastern sky I saw what I think was a meteor.  It flew by realy quick and covered a 3-4 inch space from my viewpoint. It was like a normal meteor but it had a greenish white color.  Thats it.;37.5671901408451;-122.365621126761
