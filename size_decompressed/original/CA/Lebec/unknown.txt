We were on our way to Lancaster, Ca on Jan. 13, 2006, via I-5 freeway. I noticed a strange formation of clouds when we were close to the city of Grapevine. The cloud formation was nothing I've seen before. It was like a painting on the sky. Very smooth, with horizontal lines near the center. It was huge and oval in shape. I stopped on the shoulder and observed 3 streaks that looked like smaller portions of the cloud, shooting away from the cloud. 2 of the streaks, joined together, it seems, and returned to the cloud. These 2 made a single formation, with 2 tails. They were not flying very fast. There was no trail, but the small objects looked like they had exhaust. No sound. I took 2 short videos and 14 stills of the clouds and the small streaks.;34.8818;-118.8566
