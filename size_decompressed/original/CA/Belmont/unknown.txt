My wife and I were taking our evening walk in the hills. I observed a faint star like object moving in darker space (mid-sky) far above, from northern to southern direction at a relatively high speed (almost faster speed as a passing satelite at lower altitude). When I saw it I immediately showed it to my wife. I thought it was a satelite, but as soon as it reached a certain point in sky it stopped. Then I saw that it was lined up with other 2 or 3 faint starts just like it in the sky, making and semi-curved line like a star cluster. At this time for another observer it could seem like another heavenly star cluster since the pattern was not moving. We continued our walk with this in mind that this may be another sighting and whether we should report it, until I found your web site. We figured well nothing we can do about that but to wonder.;37.5136;-122.2916
