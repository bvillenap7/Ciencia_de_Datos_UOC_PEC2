Saw a bright green fireball with yellow tail shooting directly downwards;1998-11-03 21:58:00;1 second;Saw a bright green fireball with yellow tail shooting directly downwards I was standing on my balcony when a bright green fireball with a yellow tail shot from above (approx 70 degress) to below my horizon (approx 45 degrees). The fireball was about the width of my thumb at arms length and had a glare similar to a magnesium flare (only green, not white). The tail had a length about 7 times the size of the fireball. In all, the object was as long as my middle finger held at arms length. It came straight down, 260 degrees by magnetic compass. It made no sound. I have no clue about its distance from me. Weather conditions reported at San Carlos (2 miles from here) at 8:45pm: Clear sky Wind WSW at 7mph Temp 59 degrees Pressure 30.12 (steady) Visibility 10 miles I've spent many years watching meteor showers and have never seen anything like this. Unlike meteors I'm used to seeing, this had a very shaprly defined shape, the magnesium flare like light was unusual and the tail had a constant length. I have no doubt this is a natural phenonmenon, but I know there have been many reports of unusual green fireballs in this area of the country over the last couple of years. Hope this is of some use to you.;37.5136;-122.2916
