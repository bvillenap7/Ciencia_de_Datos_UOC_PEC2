Large fireball seen near San Mateo Airport;2002-12-29 21:00:00;5 seconds;Large fireball seen near San Mateo Airport We observed a large quarter sized object so near the San Mateo airport that we looked to see if a plane had crashed.  In the sky over the mountains was a fireball that I could see pinkish and yellow waves of heat or electricity rolling off the backside.  It had a bluish tail and shot off toward Santa Rosa moving very fast.  I thought its to big to be a meteor as they look like shooting stars?  This was never mentioned on the news that night and no plane reports either.  It sure was a big well defined meteor.;37.5136;-122.2916
Meteor like flaming ball, except much larger and closer in appearance.;2003-09-04 20:30:00;1 or 2 seonds;Meteor like flaming ball, except much larger and closer in appearance. This object looked similar to a meteor with the exception that it was much larger and appeared to be much closer.  I have seen meteor showers in the past which look distant and rather small.  This object looked like it was as close as an airplane would be.  It was about the size of a walnut at that distance.  It was a bright light with an orange glowing tail.  It seemed to be moving across the horizon and downward and appeared for only for 1 to 2 seconds.  I know this must be a meteor, but I don't understand how it could have been so large and appeared so close.  I was startled by this sight, as I was riding as a passenger in a car driving down Ralston Ave. at approx 8 to 8:30 pm in Belmont, CA.  The driver of the car also witnessed the event.  I could not find any information on any meteors appearing in the local news today.;37.5136;-122.2916
