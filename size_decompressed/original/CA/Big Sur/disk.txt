I was hiking up a mountain (South of Bixby bridge & North of Little Sur) off HWY 1 in California.  I noticed an extremely rounded shape object in the sky over the mountains. The object was “gliding” at a steady speed going west, towards the ocean.  There was bright light reflecting or coming from the “front” of the object while the back seemed darker.  The brightness made me notice the object.  The object was against light blue sky and passing thru some wispy cloud.  The sun was behind me. I stopped moving, turned to my friend, then I pointed into the sky where I was last looking.  The object was gone, with no sound and we could not spot anything in the sky.  I knew this was not an airplane.;36.2497;-121.7013
