Hot wind followed by bright light.;2002-07-10 22:00:00;5 Minutes +;Hot wind followed by bright light. My friends and i were getting ready to go to sleep when we were awakened by a strong wind shaking our tent. We went outside to make sure everything was put away and noticed it was an extremely hot wind, about 10 to 15 degrees above what it was earlier. This strange wind was followed by a strange bright orange glow coming from the western part of the park. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Slow moving, silent large blinking red light less than 1/2 mile from me heading south over Pacific Ocean.;2012-01-04 05:00:00;15 min;Slow moving, silent large blinking red light less than 1/2 mile from me heading south over Pacific Ocean. Very slow moving, silent blinking red light seen while viewing meteor shower this morning.  Over the ocean, headed south.  I watched it for 15 minutes.  It appeared to veer right suddenly and it seemed as though another light, either white or green, emitted from it and then came  back to the path, returning to red again.  It then stayed in one spot for a couple of minutes before continuing south.  The light was big and that was all that I could see as it was dark.  It appeared to be directly over the coastline where I live, less than 1/2 mile from me.;36.2497;-121.7013
