UFO off coast near Big Sur, CA @2:35-2:55 AM Oct 28, 2011   A large red star-like orb, many times brighter than any bright star, was observed out my window facing west over the ocean on Friday morning.  It reminded me of the light from an electronic device so to verify I went outside to watch it alone, observing a short tail as it slowly moved from about 45degrees west of the horizon going WNW towards the horizon. It blazed up very brightly with a very long comet-like tail colored flame red before gradually fading out to nothing as it approached the western Pacific Ocean rim. I was expecting a sound but couldnâ€™t hear anything and the night was very quiet.  I have a very good view of the ocean so there was no impediment to my view from ambient light or obstructions as I live in an isolated part of the coast.;36.2497;-121.7013
