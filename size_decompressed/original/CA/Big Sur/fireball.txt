Stars in the sky dancing in the middle of a clear day.;2001-09-12 12:00:00;1 hour;Stars in the sky dancing in the middle of a clear day. It was a clear day and my husband and I were alone at Arroyo De La Cruz beach in Big Sur California.  We saw about six UFOs that looked like stars high in the sky coming from opposite directions meeting together above us.  They came together and made shapes then the shapes would spin and they would all take off back from were they came from.  They repeated this process over and over again for about an hour.  There were a few air planes that passed by way closer to the ground than the UFOs in that time.  You could tell the UFOs were going 100 times faster.  I thought it was weird that there was no thunder from the sound barrier being broken. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
