Red/Orange glowing light near powerlines.;2000-12-22 03:30:00;20 minutes;Red/Orange glowing light near powerlines. Coming through the grapevine heading north along I-5 I witnessed a red/orange light that appeared to hover near some powerlines. The light was roughly 30-40 above the power lines and sat there. The light changed hue from a dull ornage to a dull reddish color. The light sat there and didnt do anything. It quickly shot up as I approached it. I saw it from a distance and at first thought it was a helicopter from a the NAS close by but as I got closer I realized it wasnt. The light seemed to shimmer then was gone. Nothing else only a glowing light, no obvious shape or outline.;36.0063;-119.9622
