W and parallel to I-5 Approximately 01:00 from northbound land of I-5 - from pitch black night, three equidistant white discs of light turned on at 10 o'clock to our car's position and less than 1000 ft up.  Slow moving triangular craft travelled northwest across southbound I-5, banked and proceeded approx. 2000 feet parallel to I-5.  Appeared to make aircraft landing.;36.0063;-119.9622
Triangular shaped crafts and blue ball of light near Kettleman City and Coalinga California;2006-07-17 21:30:00;15-20 minutes;Triangular shaped crafts and blue ball of light near Kettleman City and Coalinga California While driving back north on Interstate 5 from a family trip to Disneyland, my wife and I noticed some strange objects in the sky just as the sun was setting between Kettleman City and Coalinga.  The first object appeared very high in the western sky and looked to be a test missle (Im assuming) of some sort...two more of these were seen some time later.  What really caught our eye was the triangular shaped craft with three large lights...one in the center and one at each of the tips of the 'wings'.  This object came VERY close to the ground and 'disappeared' and reappeared several times while making some rather acrobatic movements.  This was unlike any plane Ive ever witnessed and cropdusters do NOT make these sort of movements.   A few minutes later a bright blue single light came across from the hills in the West at a VERY high rate of speed to east ultimately out of sight.   I'm not sure what they are testing in those hills...but these were some very strange phenomena.;36.0063;-119.9622
Red lights in a triangle over Kettleman City, CA;2010-02-09 18:00:00;15 seconds;Red lights in a triangle over Kettleman City, CA On Feb. 9 I was driving back home to Fresno from Santa Barbara and saw some strange lights in the sky out the front windshield.  After the event it seemed to take about ten min. to get into Kettleman City, traveling on Highway 41.  If the direction of the road that we were on was 12 o'clock, the lights were at about 12:30. The lights were in a triangle position with equal distance between, if they were connected on the perimeter.  There were seven lights that were red and that did not blink like an airplane.  The lights then began to move an incredible distance in a short amount of time, going from the 12:30 position, to the 2:30 position within 5 seconds, and then stops.  It seemed 20 miles off now, and about 10 times closer than when first spotted with the lights in the same formation.  We then pulled over off the road to try to get video on the cell phone and that is when it elevates straight up, what had to be a couple of miles, stops for 2 seconds, and ! then accelerates off at about 3 o'clock until the lights faded out within 2 or 3 sec.  It seemed odd that before we got back on the road after about 2 min., that no cars passed by us.  It was odd because about two miles before we saw the lights, we passed two slower moving cars going in our direction. I drew a picture of the lights when i got home. If you want to contact me i could fax the drawing. I told two people i trust the most about this and I'm not bringing it up again. It didn't go over to well, just not worth it. I own a construction business in California. My perception of angles and distance are sharpened every week, so what I can not explain is how something could move so far, so fast, then stop, and then elevate straight up.;36.0063;-119.9622
