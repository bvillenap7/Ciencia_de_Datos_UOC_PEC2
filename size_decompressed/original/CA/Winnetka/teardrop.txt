shiny object in the clear sky hoovering, then suddenly disappears;2008-06-21 11:09:00;5-10 secs;shiny object in the clear sky hoovering, then suddenly disappears I was driving down the street and happened to look up in the sky because I saw something shiny, almost like metal or tin reflecting when the sun hits it.  It was the only thing that was in the sky, a clear sunny day with no clouds or anything.  I kept staring up at it as others in their cars did too because it was reflecting the sun so brightly.  I kept staring at it while it was stationary in the sky and without blinking it was GONE!  No movement, no nothing, just completely disappeared.
