Two halo balls of light hovering over an eagle in daylight.;2010-08-13 10:40:00;30 TO 40 SEC;Two halo balls of light hovering over an eagle in daylight I was  upstairs in my bedroom when I heard a helicopter so I looked out my bedroom window, facing south, to see where it was and couldn't see it. What I did see was two crows chasing a eagle up into a large palm tree on the street behind our house.when the eagle landed on the top of this very tall palm tree I happened to notice two white golf ball sized things with a halo glow surrounding them and these two objects were hovering slightly above the eagle as if they were studying it?  one of these objects moved slowly horizantally west then it move quikly away. the other seemed to disappear quicker.twenty minutes later I saw another one further away visible for about a minute. I just want to say that I've watched ufo sightings on tv in the past and I am open minded to the fact that they is more life out there in the universe and its not just us, however I never thought I would witness something truley not of this world.one would know only if they saw it for themself thats when they beleive otherwise they think you are imaging this. I really was amazed and fascinated to have witnessed something that my own family and friends will not beleive me. oh by the way I feel like I was able to see them easily through my upstairs bedroom window because it has a special mirror tint , when I ran outside I couldn't see them strange huh ? anyway I wish I was able to actually speak to a live person to tell of this amazing sight of mine. but there it is I know what I saw was not of this world!.
