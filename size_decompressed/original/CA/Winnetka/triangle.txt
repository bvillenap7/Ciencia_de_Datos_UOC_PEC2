5 objects in the Eastern San Fernando Valley sky.;2002-09-19 02:30:00;1 hour;5 objects in the Eastern San Fernando Valley sky. We saw 5 objects, 3 in a row going downward in the sky and one on each side. The objects had flashing lights of different colors. We were able to see them better with binoculars, and tried to capture them with a digital camera, but the battery died. I am an employee of a public utility and my husband is a welder. We are not usually awake at this hour, but we are preparing to go on vacation and unfortunately have a lot to do at the last minute. We hope someone else viewed this, we plan to buy a digital movie camera for anything like this in the future. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found her to be quite lucid and credible.  We explored the possibility that she and the other party might have been looking at twinkling stars, but she said that such a possibility was impossible.  She stated that both witnesses had watched the objects change their location relative to each other.  We would welcome other reports from other witnesses to this formation.  PD));34.2047;-118.573
