It was moving smoothly and quickly, and within a matter of seconds was joined by a second ball.   I put on my glasses, & woke my husband so that a second person could witness the object as well.  He seemed as astonished & perplexed as I was. The 2nd ball caught up to the 1st. The seems to hover at the same height for a few moments, then the second one vanished.   The first did more of a shrink, or slow fade until it seemed to be nothing more than a small, red, pulsing star on a descent.  Finally it disappeared altogether.  No noise accompanied the sighting.   A few minutes later an aircraft flew by across the night sky, with its usual blinking wingtip lights.   Based on the aircraft's position & size, the balls of light flew much higher into the sky & were much larger.;37.9106149068323;-122.042624223603
