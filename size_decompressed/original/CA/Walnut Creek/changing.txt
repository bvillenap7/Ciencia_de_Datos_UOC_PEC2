The lights seemed to be traveling east to west, because they became brighter and larger.   The lights appeared to be one aircraft banking or flying sideways, in one direction for a long period.  Then the lights changed  to a horizontal position, then switch positions to a vertical formation, then separated, flying straight up and disappearing.  These object (s) made no sounds.   The lights were witnessed by 3 people (who have never seen anything like it)  at our home which sits high on the hills west of Walnut Creek, CA.;37.9106149068323;-122.042624223603
White rotating elongated object with ability to  “shape shift”.;2021-07-05 20:38:00;2 minutes;White rotating elongated object with ability to  “shape shift”. It was solid white. Looked like a small plane with no wings at first. Flying at high altitude. Did not show up on flight tracker program. I started filming it. After it passed over the house from the backyard, we ran out front & it disappeared. Reviewing the footage & zooming in, it had an aura around it. It was clearly spinning in a rotation. It looked solid, then rotated into what looked like a burst of energy cloud, then an aura, then gone, but you could still see like a dissipated smokey look with an oval appearance. Then it went back to a solid appearance and repeated this 3 times that we could see in our footage. So in the rotations it had the ability to change. When enhancing a still shot, the front had a purplish spot. Another was in the middle and the backend was shaped like a house front. /\  shape roof with = shape under. It looked like one row of square lights lined the pitch roof looking area and two rows of square lights were on the bottom. It ! was very distinctive within the cigar/oval shape aura surrounding it. It made no noise at all. It was completely quiet. My 7 year old grandson spotted it first. When we were trying to enhance the footage to see it closer the laptop shut down on its own, twice. It was approximately 8:37-8:38 pm on July 5, 2021.;37.9106149068323;-122.042624223603
