((HOAX??))  Saucer object with rotating colored lights hovering in sky.;2006-12-05 21:50:00;30 seconds;Saucer object with rotating colored lights hovering in sky. I was driving north on Highway 680 through Walnut Creek and I saw in the North West sky a hovering saucer with a dome shape on top.  There were colored lights of red, yellow, possibly green circling on the bottom of the craft that moved in a counterclockwise direction.  The top of the domed shape had small red stationary lights.  I couldn't see the object but the silhouette was well defined.  The object didn't move and I had to exit the freeway after which I could not see it anymore.
