It was moving very slowly, and appeared to stop for brief periods of time.  It was an Oval/disk shape and had an aura of bright white light around it, that occasionally shot of short beams of white light.  It was a totally clear day, blue sky, with absolutely no other aircraft, or clouds in the sky.  It also seemed to appear,disappear, then reappear, becoming dark, and then brilliant light and aura. It took me several minutes to figure out what was going on, then I ran and got my camera.  But the camera didn't have a card in it! So I had to go back, get a card out of the package, turn camera off and on, and then go back and refocus-this process took me about 7 minutes.  When I took the photo the object was further away, and I had to wait in between it's disappearing and appearing. I managed to get 4 consecutive photos, and sometimes when it reappeared it seemed closer and then further away. I sit on my deck quite a lot, and I've seen a lot of aircraft,blimps, etc.  But this object was very unusual.  I hope the photos are good enough to be magnified and analyzed, allowing identification of this object. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.9106149068323;-122.042624223603
