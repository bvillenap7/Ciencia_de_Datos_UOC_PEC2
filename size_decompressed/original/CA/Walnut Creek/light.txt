One ws comming from the northwest, and the other almost intercepted it from the north. The one that was comming from the north was moving at first, then it stood stationary for about 5 min. The other light was moving slowly towards the south, Over Walnut Creek. Then the light that was stationary started to move. It just started to move straight up in the air. And then moved south. It must have climbed for about 5 seconds, but in that 5 seconds, it moved upward until it was almost a small light, then, it moved south. Both crafts had no sound, they had bright yellowish golden lights, and when they flew over head, there were two other lights on either side of the bright light. The bright light was in the shape of a star. It had points on it. ((NUFORC Note:  Might be landing lights on an airliner.  Just a guess.  PD));37.9106149068323;-122.042624223603
One orb, followed by a jet, followed, in turn, by another orb. I am not certain exactly when this happened.;2002-05-15 20:30:00;3 Min.;One orb, followed by a jet, followed, in turn, by another orb. I am not certain exactly when this happened. I was taking an evening walk in a rural area outside the city when I saw what I first thought was a fast moving artificial satelite (although it seemed a bit low for a satelite). Then I heard a jet. I looked and saw a fighter jet come over the hilly horizon. It was following the light in the sky (going the exact same direction as the orb of light). Then I realized that the orb of light really was quite low and small (it could not have been larger than a VW beatle based on the size of the jet following it). Both jet and orb disappeared over the hilly horizon. I wondered did I just see an ET craft?. Then I thought to myself insuffient evidence for that conclusion and a couple seconds later another identical looking light moved through the sky in exactly the same direction as the first. There was no jet following the second light. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.9106149068323;-122.042624223603
Bright searchlight as the sun set ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD));2002-10-14 19:00:00;3-5 minutes;Bright searchlight as the sun set 	Two friends and I were at the Unity Center in Walnut Creek about to go into the sancuary when a strange searchlight caught our eye.  It was very high up and looked similar to a helecoptor searchlight, yet many times brighter and there was no motor sound.  It weaved back and forth slightly.  As we watched it, a small plane flew through the beam and was fully illuminated by it.  The beam of light was intensly bright, yet diffused over a broad area.  At the end was a bright, indigo blue line of smoke.  Another friend came rushing up and said she had seen it from her car where she watch it move straight up with the bright light at the back of the craft.  As we watched, the light suddenly dimmed and dissappeared. The blue line remained bright and visible as the sky dimmed with the setting sun. ((Vandenberg rocket launch.

Blue/Orange bright lights filled the sky.;2014-03-05 22:45:00;2 minutes;Blue/Orange bright lights filled the sky It was raining the night of Mar 5, 2014, (Wednesday) and through our bedroom window, we saw 2 extremely bright lights - the first being bright blue/cyan followed by orange light. We saw the lights in East direction..   It was like the whole sky was filled with these colored lights.  The sequence (approx.) was as under:  1. blue light - 2 secs 2. orange light - 1 sec 3. 30 sec delay 4. blue light - 2 secs 5. orange light - 1-2 secs   Don't remember if we saw any for the third time.  The lights were nothing like seen before.. extremely bright...  1st we thought it's lightning, but the colors were so vivid, it couldn't be lightning.

Bright light object over N.W. Diablo Valley.;2015-05-06 22:30:00;1 hour;Bright light object over N.W. Diablo Valley. I went out into my backyard to have a cigarette and noticed a bright light toward the NW, as I procceded to watch it it would make sudden moves.   I ran back into my house to get my mother, we both watched it for almost an hour before it just kinda vanished.;37.9106149068323;-122.042624223603
Ball of bright, white light 4-5x larger than a star tracks accross the sky for 2 minutes and shimmers out and vanishes before horizon;2020-09-17 20:00:00;2 minutes;Ball of bright, white light 4-5x larger than a star tracks accross the sky for 2 minutes and shimmers out and vanishes before horizon My wife and I go on a half mile walk around our neighborhood every night after dinner.  As we finished our walk and were returning to our driveway around 8:15 PM, I am enjoying the view of the stars for the first time in weeks, as there has been terrible smoke cover for over a month due to the wildfires.  As I'm looking south at the stars, I noticed one of these stars is moving across the sky.  It looked JUST like a star, very bright, white light however, it was 4-5x larger than a star typically looks.  We observed carefully as it tracked overhead for 2-3 minutes there were definitely no flashing lights or any changes in the brightness however, it did appear to veer from side to side changing course several times (although this could have been imagined, I don't know for sure).  About 75% accross the sky towards the opposite horizon, the light begins to shimmer into more of a reflection, and slowly vanishes in clear view, long before reaching the horizon.  While! I am not saying that this was 100% a UFO, I am confident it was NOT an aircraft, missile, or satellite. It had no flashing lights, red or white it made no noise, and was WAY too high to be a helicopter. It was dead quiet out, and if it was a plane, we can always hear their engines several seconds late. I will say that I do have a personal interest in UFOs, so it may be a confirmation bias but at the same time, it was a very strange light that I've never seen anything like before, and did look very similar to other videos I've seen that made a strong case for being a true unidentified flying object.  When checking off Characteristis below, this triggered a memory about 2 minutes before seeing this light, i noticed an airplane with solid, yellow lights on the bottom in a triangular shape. I made note of this to my wife as it seemed odd to see a plane in flight with solid illumination lights on the bottom like this, in addition to their flashing red/white traffic lights. I am not sure if this is related or not but figured I should mention. It was travelling in the same direction as the ball of light, about 1-2 minutes before the ball of light was seen. This plane did not make a noise either (I guess we can hear planes if they are low enough/increasing elevataion? Must've been at cruising altitude but strange to see it close enough to make out these details and not hear it).;37.9106149068323;-122.042624223603
