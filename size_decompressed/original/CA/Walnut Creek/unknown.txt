Airliners commonly seen in Bay Area bear no resemblance in height, speed or perceived shape (trinagular).  Seen 3-4 months earlier on same course, but then ascended so high it eventually left no contrails, and returned 15 min later, descending to level to create contrails.  On 2/99 sighting, aircraft left two distinct, parallel contrails, despite fact aircraft itself could not be seen even with binoculars.;37.9106149068323;-122.042624223603
Bright moving object high in the sky.  Changed intensity as it moved.;2002-06-24 21:55:00;7-10 seconds;Bright moving object high in the sky.  Changed intensity as it moved. I looked almost straight up and saw what I thought was a star at first but it began to move slowly. It was about as bright as Venus at first.  It then increased in intensity and picked up speed.  It then lost some of its intensity but itâ€™s speed stayed steady.  I told my girlfriend to look, but just that quickly it became really dim like some far away star.  I thought this was strange, as I didn't know satellites to change intensity and pick up speed.  Also, I lost sight of it as it dimmed until I could not see it.  The whole experience could not have been more than 10 seconds.. ((NUFORC Note:  An Iridium flash was visible from this location at 21:53 hrs.

Three irregular shapes flying in close proximity in Walnut Creek, Ca.;2014-01-23 07:40:00;60 seconds;Three irregular shapes flying in close proximity in Walnut Creek, Ca. On 23 Jan 14 at 0740 my colleague and I witnessed three unidentifiable objects fly near Walnut Creek Ca. The three objects first appeared to be three small helicopters flying in formation up the 680 corridor from Pleasanton toward Walnut Creek.  As they made their way north they made several irregular deviations in their flight path.  As they became closer (15-20 seconds), they broke formation and began rotating around each other in very close proximity.  Every so often they would move back into formation for a few seconds and then begin the rotation again.   We continued to speculate that they were aircraft and witnessed the sun reflecting off flat sides as they spun. We monitored them until they left our field of view, which was no more than 60 seconds of total visibility.  During that time, they must have traveled approximately 6 miles before turning skyward with a heading of north northwest. The best description I can think of is the following:  Three similar sized shapes approximately ten to fifteen feet in length with at least several flat sides, which explains the sun reflection of their sides as they rotated about.  They also did not appear to ever be more than twenty feet apart the entire time. Their flight path was very irregular and they moved between sixty and one hundred knots and maintained an elevation that was fairly consistent at about twelve hundred feet until the end where they shot skyward.;37.9106149068323;-122.042624223603
