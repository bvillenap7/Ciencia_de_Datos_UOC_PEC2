Circular object in No. CA streaking towards Mt. Diablo State Park area;2003-09-04 20:20:00;5 seconds;Circular object in No. CA streaking towards Mt. Diablo State Park area My wife and I had just returned from a local trip when we noticed something moving in the Eastern sky.  We immediately saw a bright circular object moving at a high rate of speed from the sky towards the ground (best guess is that the object was 2-3 miles away, headed towards the Mt. Diablo State Park area at a 45 degree angle).  Object appeared as a very bright green circle of light surrounding a relatively dim red light, made no sound, and disappeared after only five seconds.;37.9106149068323;-122.042624223603

Large red object.;2017-01-19 18:00:00;20 seconds;Large Red Object. My husband and I saw what appeared to be a large, glowing red object in the sky.  It was very high and very far away.  It was completely still for about 10 seconds.  Then it flashed on and off, then back on.   Then it moved very quickly side to side, then off again and disappeared.   We saw a large airplane in the same area about 4 minutes later.;37.9106149068323;-122.042624223603
Extremely bight light in the night sky that slowly moved away was able to light up a large area with two beams;2018-10-07 19:30:00;5 minutes;Extremely bight light in the night sky that slowly moved away was able to light up a large area with two beams 1) it was not a plane or a heliocopter.  It was not a star.  Started out as two extremely bright lights shining and creating a circular nebula (like the moon lighting up part of the sky behind clouds. 2) pulled over the car with son to watch.   now only one light left.  extremely bight like it would be a very large meteor, but seemed stationary.  Then moved low in the horizon. 3) I am a skeptical science guy, and have never seen anything ever like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Launch of Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg AFB.
