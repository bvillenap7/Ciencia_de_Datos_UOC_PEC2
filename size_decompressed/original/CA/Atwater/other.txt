I don't know who else to report this to, but I saw a bizarre object at about 7:45 pm PST this evening (Nov. 9) in Atwater CA.  I was in my back yard when an object caught my eye, moving in a SE direction.  At first I thought it may be a meteor streak, but was stunned to see it was a silhouette of an object, dimly lit at the outer part with individual lights the size of background stars, the object appeared to be the shape of a trapazoid moving sideways.  It seemed to be a few hundred feet off the ground, gliding rapidly and completely without sound.  It would seem to me it would have been seen by others, as other aircraft were in the air at the time.  I don't what I saw, whether it is experimental craft or what, but it seems strange to me that experimental craft would be zipping down the Central Valley without strobes with other planes in the air.  Regardless of what the explanation is, what I saw was really quite stunning. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD));37.3472;-120.6039
Strange occurance.;2014-02-17 00:32:00;5 minutes;Strange occurance I'm sitting here having a cigarette and I look up at what my mind automaticllly thinks is a prop plane passing by but the only odd erie thing was it made absolutely no sound...?  When I noticed that It was moving silently across the night sky, I shouted to my brother and he didn't think much of it at first until he also realized it made no noise...   It had  red and white blinking lights and seemed about 2,000 ft off the earth in elevation!?  Are they just private aircraft contractors building silent planes or are they from alien worlds?;37.3472;-120.6039
Strange rectangular objects shaping low hanging clouds and flashing green light.;2020-03-23 05:45:00;2 minutes;Strange rectangular objects shaping low hanging clouds and flashing green light. I saw two strange crafts, each with a set of what looked to be functioning claws of some sort.  Early in the morning while the sun barely was putting out any light, they flew through the low hanging clouds shaping them into cubes.  They were pure white in color with the only discerning trait besides the claws being a green flashing light.  Immediately after seeing this strange phenomena, I headed back inside to grab my phone in an attempt to record what I saw, only to suddenly feel very drowsy and then wake up at 1:13 PM the same day.;37.3472;-120.6039
