Dark silent rough looking craft.;2014-06-04 02:00:00;15 seconds;Dark silent rough looking craft. I was laying down on chair cushions enjoying the shooting stars.  I noticed a rectangular rough looking object flying approx.150mph.  No lights and no sound came from it.  It was maybe 3-1000 feet from ground level.  It was heading eastwards.  I was a little frightened realizing it is intentionally meant to not be seen.   I hesitated for 20 minutes to call 911.  But if someone else seen it then I would feel better about such a strange call.   Anyhow 911 responded what is your emergency?.  I said it isn't an emergency but more a inquiry.  Has any one called about a dark large craft flying eastward no sound or lights?   They were understanding and asked shape and size.  I guessed on size and said about size of a football field but it was more size of a 18 wheeler.  I just got excited, I guess.;37.3472;-120.6039
