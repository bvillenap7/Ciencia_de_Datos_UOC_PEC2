Orb in the Night;2012-06-20 23:10:00;25 seconds;Orb in the Night At approximately 11:10 pm I observed out in the back of my yard a glowing cirular orb about 1000-1500 feet off the ground. I do not know for how long it was there, but I do not believe I initially saw it, and that I noticed it and it was brighter than the surrounding stars. As it caught my eye the craft moved rapidly upward and climbed higher. As it went higher the orb disappeared, then reappeared, before disappearing completely. During these quick seconds this orb made no sound. This was peculiar but what was more puzzling was that I noticed three aircraft in the area flying around almost as if trying to observe the orb. These aircraft made the distinct sounds of planes. Even more bewildering was that two of these aircraft appeared to be heading right towards one another as if they were going to collide, but passed within 500-600 feet of each other. These two aircraft flew in the same area, but lower, than the orb which I saw.;37.3472;-120.6039
