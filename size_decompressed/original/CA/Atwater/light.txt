I have 3 small children whom were inside taking a nap.  I went out back to feed my dogs after i sat down and made sure they werent aggressive.  As  I am sitting, suddenly have the feeling of something trying to get my attention or the feeling of being watched and you look towards the direction.  It was as if time slowed down and i see an oval shaped light energy ball it seemed to shine/brighten up get a bit bigger once it knew it had gotten my attention and than just disappeared it felt like it wanted me to look at it, it wasn't hostile seemed curious or it was checking up?  I always see ufos here but nothing like this.  I wonder when will be the next time i see it.  It was peaceful bynun.
