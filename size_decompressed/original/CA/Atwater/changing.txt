UFO changed colors/shape over Atwater, California;2011-08-27 21:00:00;10-15 sec;UFO changed colors/shape over Atwater, California I was sitting in my cousin's back yard talking with a friend when a red light in the sky that I thought must have been a firework caught my eye.  I automatically assumed it was a firework due to the richness of the color and it was descending just above the top of a wooden fence that separates his property from the next.  I stood up, and informed my friend, who immediately turned around to look. The entire sighting lasting 10 to 15 seconds. Just as I was asking him what it was it changed course and began to increase altitude and rapidly descended and ascended in successive fashion, too fast for me to count how many times.  All the while, the object changed color in a very fluid motion from red at first, to gold, green, amber and possibly blue, but not too sure.  While the object was changing colors, it was also changing shapes, going from what I would describe as a teardrop, to a sphere, to almost seeming to flatten out. It then proceeded to head west away from our location towards and probably past CA-99. I caught about 10 seconds or so of this object on my cell phone camera, although by the time I began recording, It was already heading away and had stopped changing colors/shape. I could not identify the object, and it was COMPLETELY inaudible. Shortly after the event, other witnesses that had gathered, along with myself, saw multiple conventional aircraft with flashing lights following the same general flightpath of the object.;37.3472;-120.6039
