Around 9:30 p.m. in Bishop California a fleet of at least 20 in a straight line, evenly spaced formation moving slowly across the sky from west to east. Color white / silver ... looked like a sattelite but much closer. I have seen quite a few interesting mysterious sky phenomena on the eastern side of the Sierra (Mammoth Lakes last summer) and in Bishop a similar formation Winter of 2020 (Decemeber i think - did not report - but this formation had at least 10 more) I'm open, non-fanatical, grounded. This formation tonight was awesome. Woke my friend to witness it with me.;37.5014;-118.4048
