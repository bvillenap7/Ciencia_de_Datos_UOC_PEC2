Monday morning November 5,2007 at 6:08 AM as I was leaving for work I looked up towards the West sky I noticed two moving lights. One bright one and following it was a smaller dim orange one.  They moved from West to East towards the sunrise over our mountains. They were moving in tandem as if the larger bright one was towing the smaller orange one.  Neither one had any blinking lights as regular aircraft do. I have never seen anything like this before so I thought that I would report it. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle.
