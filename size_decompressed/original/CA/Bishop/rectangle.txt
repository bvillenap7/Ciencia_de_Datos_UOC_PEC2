While star gazing my cousin and I witnessed a craft travel at high rate of speed from east to west.  We watched it travel from the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada mountians over the crest and beyond to the west, then it seemed to drastically change direction, dropping below the horizon, which for us wast the sierra crest.  All this took place in about 10 seconds, Approximatly 40 miles.  The craft traveled at an altitude of about 20-25 thousand feet above sea level, estimating, and accounting for our 11 thousand foot camp.  It appearead as rectangluar from our perspective, we had a somewhat side view of it, for it traveled to our north by a few miles.  It pulsed with light originating from it's core.  It also appeared to have a glowing distrotion field around it, the atmosphere around it appeared to be bent like a teardrop around it, bending light and glowing as well, a blue/greenish hue.  It made no sound, not even a sonic boom, which I would expect from something traveling at such a high rate of speed.  I never thought to report the even but stumbling across this site has made doing just that quite easy.  All my statements are true, all times, and distances are approximations.  As far as I am aware My cousin and I are the only people to have seen the event, we were backpacking and were in a remote location, camping on a lake in the southern Bishop Creek Basin outside of Bishop California.  If we haden't happened to be looking at the sky right at that moment we would have easly missed it.;37.5014;-118.4048
