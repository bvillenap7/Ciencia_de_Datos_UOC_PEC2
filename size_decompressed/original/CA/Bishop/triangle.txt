I was laying out in the back yard observing the stars and watching for sattelites. The moon was pretty bright and had not long been up. I noticed two stars to the south that I had never seen befor. Then I noticed they were moving south to north and east of me. I then realized that there were three stars moving S to N. I first thought it was three sattilites or possibly aircraft moving. There was no sound.. and I had never seen three sattilites move in the same area like this befor. I called for my wife to get my binoculars. She did. By this time the three lights had formed a triangle east of me and were low on the horizon. I could not put all three lights in the field of view of the binoculars. I had to go from light to light. I then noticed that the triangle was really dark in the center and blocked out other stars as it passed S. to N. I then lost it as it moved to the north. It was not three objects. It was one BIG object. I am a private investigator. I have been a policeman. I have been a cowboy and a mule packer, accoustomed to watching the sky for signes of weather. ect.;37.5014;-118.4048
