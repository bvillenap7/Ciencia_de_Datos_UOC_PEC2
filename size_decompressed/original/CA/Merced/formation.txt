We couldn't identify any shapes, and went from the time we saw them to the time they disappeared into the horizon it took approximately 30-40 seconds.  They were flying in a random pattern, and it looked as if one of the lights had fallen behind and had to speed up to catch up to the rest.  So after we had heard there was a 6.5 earthquake in Napa Valley a few hours away.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
