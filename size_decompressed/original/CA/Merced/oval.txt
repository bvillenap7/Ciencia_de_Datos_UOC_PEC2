Orange/rust colored Oval type object in Merced on the Fourth of July.;2015-07-04 20:00:00;<5 minutes;Orange/rust colored Oval type object in Merced on the Fourth of July While shooting fireworks, I noticed my daughter not looking toward the show, but up toward the sky.  I asked if she was okay and she pointed her phone.   Curious I asked what she was doing and she kept asking me if I saw it.  She said it was an orangish/coppery rust color and it just faded away.   The area below where she sighted the object is a fallow field, with dry brush, so there was no fireworks being shot over the area for fear of fires.   The next morning she showed me her picture she took.  She originally thought she didn't get it but in the morning light found it on her phone as you can see by the picture, it is difficult to see.   We did not hear anything and there was no smoke trail.  The object seemed to show up and vanish quietly with not lights.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
