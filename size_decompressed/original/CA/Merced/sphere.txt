U.S.A.;2007-03-03 11:00:00;5 to 7 min;Fleet of forty glowing spheres seen and caught on video over the skies of  Merced  Ca. U.S.A. While looking up at the chemtrail filled sky over central California and commentating on the global elite and their agenda for a new world order Myself and a friend notice something bizarre in the midmorning sky. An anamoly more frequently observed in the skies over Mexico in recent years. The round glowing spheres appeared be in a loose nonmoving formation slowly changing shape within itself. If they were balloons or birds they would be rising or falling or moving left to right. This of was not the case. I have video! Facing due North from our position.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
