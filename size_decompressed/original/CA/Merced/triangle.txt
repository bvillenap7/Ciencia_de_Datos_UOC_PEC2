3 lights form perfect acute triangle for huge craft moving slowly overhead;2003-07-04 23:50:00;3 minutes;3 lights form perfect acute triangle for huge craft moving slowly overhead We had just came home from a fourth of July party and decided to sit on the roof to get a look at anything else going off.  I was glancing at the stars when I notice one of them began to move.  At first I thought it was a satalite, so I motioned to my girlfriend to get her attention, then I look back up and two other lights of the same brightness (which was a little brighter than the surrounding stars) were behind the first star I saw in the shape on an acute triangle.  Perfect in balance.  The only lights on the craft were the three lights, one in the front with the two in the rear at each corner.  If this was one solid craft, not three in a formation, it was huge.  At least the size of a football field. The craft moved at a slow constant speed overhead us.  The height seemed less than a normal commercial plane.  There was no noise at all.  The reason I think it was a solid craft is because how all three of the lights moved.  All of them stayed at all times and equal distance apart from each other.  The craft was in no hurry and I could see it for at least three minutes.  The way it disappeared blew our minds.  The craft moved across the sky to reach a point to where it simply disappear.  When I say point in the sky, that is what I mean.  I watch the lead light disappear at this point while the back two continued on the same path to this point and disappeared as well.  There were no traces of the lights past that point and have not seen it since.  I live on the outskirts of town.  A simple description of what I saw is three lights in the sky in the shape of a perfect acute triangle, and because of the darkness I could see any detail between the lights, cruise slowly across the sky and go into some wormhole and disapper. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the sighting is consistent with the three satellites, thought to be launched periodically by the U. S. Navy as part of their NOSS satellite system.  The manner in which the lights were seen to fade is consistent with satellites when they fly into the Earth's shadow.  PD));37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
Small agile triangular object with lights on the corners seen along I-5 south of Merced;2004-04-14 00:30:00;3 minutes;Small agile triangular object with lights on the corners seen along I-5 south of Merced I was driving north on I-5 in California (CA) and we were south of Merced.  At around 12:30 on April 14, 2004 I noticed an odd pair of lights.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but my parents saw it too.  I first noticed it when it appeared that the object was vertical with only 2 corners visible (imagine viewing a triangular block from the side).It appeared to be a very small triangular object with lights on the 3 corners.  The lights were round circular and cycled.  To visualize one set of lights, imagine a cross section of a pipe with many lights making the circle.  It was these lights that alternated kind of like christmas lights that look like the electricity is moving through them.  For example, let's say each set of lights was only made of 3 lights.  Light 1 is on, light 2 and 3 are off.  Then L1 is off, L2 is on, L3 is off.  Then L1 is off, L2 is off, L3 is on.  Then L1 is on, L2 is off, L3 is off.  I wish I could describe it better.  Hopefully the text image below will come out correctly.  You should see 3 O's portraying the 3 sets of circular light schemes with each O at a corner of an equilateral triangle.  O O O  It hovered over the highway for maybe 30 seconds and quickly sped off to the right hand site shoulder behind the overpass.  As I approached the overpass it came speeding back over the high way.  It hovered very low.  It actually passed right in front of my car twice and then hovered off to the left and shined a light (almost like a small white flashlight) right at me from the right hand side.  This light came from one of the sides, not from one of the corners of the object.  It followed me for a little bit and I was going just over 80mph.  Then it crossed over the northbound side again and then went back to the right hand side where it vanished behind the overpass.  I saw it for probably close to a minute or two total but it seems longer.  I believe the color was black but i couldn't quite see it because of the lights.  I basically only saw the lights from it.  It may have been some one playing tricks on people because it was a very small object.  Not exactly large enought to hold little green men.  It probably close to 3 or 5 feet in length.  It was definitely not wider than my Civic.  However it had great agility and speed and it was silent.  I was definitely not the only person to see this.  Aside from my parents in the same car, there were a bunch of trucks on the freeway at the time.  I did a search on the internet at about 5:30 PM the same day to see if anyone had more info on this and I can't seem to find anything so I am entering in this info.

I am a law enforcement official and on april 18th, 2010 as I was working on patrol at approximately 0120 hrs.I was parked facing a south direction approximately 300 feet from Gst on Community Dr. (This is in the area of Merced College the College parking area lights were all off) I then got off my vehicle and looked up at the clear sky, as I looked up in a north/east direction above me I notice a white  V-shape formation approximately 100 yards width moving slow in a north/east direction. The V-shape formation had no sound to it. Then the V-shape formation broke up and got in to three smaller formations, with three objects in each formation.  Each formation was now shape in a triangle formation.  Two of the formation got closer together still heading in the same direction and the formation closer to me separated and headed north.  The size of each object in the formation was the size of a small compact vehicle the object's were white in color with a haze's around them. As I staired at the formations for approximately 30 sec. They took off at a high rate of speed in their direction of travel.  I then got back into my vehicle and left the area heading north on Gst. to see if i could see the formation again.  I got to the intersection of Gst and bellevue and headed east on bellevue and parked off the side of the road approximately 200 yards from Gst.  This area is in the county of Merced, CA, and is surrounded by fields and their is really no lights out in this area where I stopped.  The formation never came back over me.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
