Strobe white light that responds to flashlight signal.;2012-01-22 01:30:00;30 minutes;Strobe white light that responds to flashlight signal. This report is in response to 8/10/17 in LA Rue, Ohio.  I work a grave yard shift for a University.  During slow times of an evening, I am able to take short walks or just step outside for fresh air.  I will find a spot where most of the light pollution is at its minimum.  The exact date is not written down when I first saw the white bright single light strobe in the clear sky.  When I saw it I thought it I might have had an optical problem from being tired or a twinkle from a distant star.   Continuing my stellular gaze, I definitely saw the distinct single bright strobe.  Knowing that this was not something normal.  Too close for a distant star and no other lights to not be an airplane.  I flashed my powerful LED flashlight at area.  The response was an immediate strobe of light back. WOW.  What was that.  I responded again.  An immediate pulse of light back again.  I walked to darker area to try and see what was the source.  I flashed my light again.  Another response.  I could not see what was the light was coming from.  I went three flights of stairs up to the roof where our cooling towers are and the darkest spot I knew of when the lights were off.  I flashed my light in the general area and was immediately signal back.  This went on for 20 more minutes.  I was dumbfounded to what was happening.  I had to leave and resume my normal operations.  I had a very hard time trying to understand what had just happened and to this day still cannot!  This has gone on and off all this time until 3 months ago.   I went on vacation for three weeks, and when I came back, the phenome has just stopped.  There is so much more to the story.  I had recruited other individuals to witness the strobe.  They were able to verify that I had not completely gone mad by also witnessing the light.  What or who is actually in the night sky is an exciting mystery.  I wish I knew the source of that light some day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD));37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
