3 CRAFT OVER A VACANT FIELD AT NIGHT, 2 CRAFTS WITH LIGHTS & 1 AN ORANGE BALL;2008-04-16 23:00:00;10 minutes;3 CRAFT OVER A VACANT FIELD AT NIGHT, 2 CRAFTS WITH LIGHTS & 1 AN ORANGE BALL OVER A VACANT FIELD ON THE NORTHERN EDGE OF MY TOWN, I SAW 3 UFO'S.  FIRST OF ALL THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND HEARD SO THIS EXCLUDES AIRPLANES OR HELICOPTERS.  2 OF THE U.F.O.'S APPEARED AS CRAFT-LIKE OBJECTS.  THEY CONSISTED OF 2 ROWS OF CONSTANT LIGHT BLUE HALOGEN LIGHTS, THE TOP ROW HAD 3 LIGHTS AND THE BOTTOM ROW HAD 4 LIGHTS.  THE 2 CRAFTS HOVERED IN THE VACANT FIELD AS IF IT THEY WERE MEETING ONE ANOTHER.  THE 2 CRAFT WERE EXACTLY THE SAME IN APPEARANCE.  THE 3RD CRAFT ACTUALLY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A CRAFT BECAUSE IT WAS AN ORANGISH BALL OF LIGHT.  THIS 3RD ONE WAS QUICKLY APPROACHING THE OTHER 2 WAITING CRAFTS FROM ABOVE IN A TYPE OF SWOOP OR SWISHING MOTION.  MY FRIEND WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLE WATCHING SUCH BIZARRE LIGHTS WITH NO SOUND IN THE SKY AND AT NIGHT SO WE LEFT THE SCENE.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
Flashing, pulsating ufo hovering over merced, ca;2011-09-02 01:10:00;2 hours;Flashing, pulsating ufo hovering over merced, ca Merced, CA, Sep 2 , 2011  I opened up my bedroom window when a flashing caught my eye.  I went outside onto the patio and recorded several videos over the next couple of hours.  There were 3 witnesses with myself at the time that I began to film the object.  After comparing the videos, it is evident that the light moved in between the shooting of different clips, however I never actually witnessed it move. I didn't witness it do anything other than sit still and flash erratically, which was enough for me to shoot a few minutes of video and take a few still shots.  After viewing the pictures and videos I am more baffled than before. It sat stationary for so long that I eventually went inside and went to bed.  One person said that flashing blue and red lights are a sign of a satellite, but I have never seen this before from our patio and will be observing the sky to see if I see it again.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
Two bright unidentified flying objects appear in Northern night sky, Southeast bound in Merced, Ca.;2012-11-01 00:00:00;~1 Minute;Two bright unidentified flying objects appear in Northern night sky, Southeast bound in Merced, Ca. Two very bright, orange-yellowish, shining lights  appear flying very low, overhead in the Northern night sky heading Southeast bound.  Appearing to be about 4 or 5 times the size of the Northern Star, they fly significantly close underneath all the fog and clouds.  They flew adjacent to each other and were pretty much flying in sync with each other, yet they each seemed to have an individual movement(like two cars driving side by side on a freeway).  Seconds go by then the one on the left starts to fade or flicker out.  Once the left one goes out, the one on the right follows right behind just mere seconds after.   Again, there were two objects observed.  They appeared to have no structure, just very bright with an orange and yellow shine like  extremely radiant candle lights or illuminating orbs.  Adjacent and almost in sync but still with an individual movement about them.   This happened between 12:00 a.m. and 1:00 a.m., while celebrating Halloween.  The weather was completely overcast.   The Moon and stars were nowhere to be seen and absolutely in no way, shape, or form, could be seen that night.   Other observers witnessed the same but were slightly intoxicated due to the reason for the season.  I was sober.  I do not drink.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
Merced CA Bright red lights flashing in line sequence.;2014-04-13 21:00:00;5 minutes;Merced CA Bright red lights flashing in line sequence I was driving south on highway 99 south. as I was crossing Merced CA,  I saw out of the corner of my eye some red lights flashing in the sky.  I noticed it because they were very bright in a far distance and flashing but formed a line with one higher than the others.  I pulled over to get a better look.  After pulling over with in a couple of minutes they started to fly away in the opposite direction of mine started flshing and dispursed (disappeared) one and two at a time.  I was amazed.  And Scared.   I am not sure where to report it.   This took place at 9:00pm more or less.   There is videos that look exactly like what I saw on you tube. so obviously i'm  not the only one who seen this.  And at different dates.

Very bright orange stars moving down and then north, West of my location.;2017-01-06 19:15:00;5 minutes;Very bright orange stars moving down and then north, West of my location. From my backyard, looking due West.  I see two bright orange stars, 10 times brighter than the brightest star.  Both are descending from 30 degrees to let's say 25 degrees altitude, due West from my perspective.  Separated from each other by about two inches at arm length.  Each light was horizontal to one another other.  After two or so minutes descending very slowly, they changed direction due North (moving one or two feet to the right, at arm's length.)  The whole event lasted 5-10 minutes, or so, before each light disappeared, one after another after a 2-3 minute interval.  The event repeated itself, identically. https://youtu.be/pFLGmOweVtM;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
String of lights/orbs, about 20+, slowly moving in a single line of various spacing in central California, may witnesses;2021-02-17 05:25:00;3 minutes;String of lights/orbs, about 20+, slowly moving in a single line of various spacing in central California, may witnesses At 5:25am PST I walked into our backyard to check on our dog.  Something caught my eye in the sky and looked up, southern skies towards Fresno, Ca.  What I saw made me freeze, it was a perfect string of lights, almost like airplanes if my brain was trying to confirm what I saw. Not even in spacing but very close together. Almost like a Christmas string of lights, they were moving at a steady but not rushed pace until they disappeared from view.  I posted on Facebook what I saw and immediately four of my friends who were just leaving their workout all saw it. Another friend's husband recorded them.  Nobody has any idea what they were...;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
