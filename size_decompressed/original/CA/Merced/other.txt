My neighbor had been outside with me last night (3/20/15) and as we were smoking our cigarettes.  She was stuck on a star....the only one in the whole sky, and it appeared to change colors.   Then tonight my brother comes knocking shortly after midnight and I happen to look at the sky and saw a crazy round like barrier or out line in the sky being created by the lights.  Each light moved in a slow sway motions, reflecting an almost completely transparent threat like light, which connect them in specified groups.  Each time we heard the strange kind of baritone rumble in the sky only a few would zip full speed ahead and vanquish.   I made an attempt to photograph on laptop but my laptop shut down every time I took it outside. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time and date above.
