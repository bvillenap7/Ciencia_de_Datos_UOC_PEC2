2 gold colored speherical objects w/ pointed ends;1999-06-01 19:00:00;1 minute;2 gold colored speherical objects w/ pointed ends 2 spherical shaped flying objects, gold in color, no lights, had 4 points on each object.  Both flying side by side.  Moving very slowly and low to the ground (approx 1500 ft).  No sound at all.  Everything seemed to get quiet.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
Multiple orange orbs, in a triangle shape, moving NE to SW, then disappeared, followed by more.;2013-03-13 20:48:00;30 seconds;Multiple orange orbs, in a triangle shape, moving NE to SW, then disappeared, followed by more. Saw three orbs, orange in color, traveling slowly in a triangle formation, from NE to SW, then disappeared.  After the first three a single orb followed and disappeared, and finally a last single orb followed and disappeared.  All moved at the same speed, were the same size, and disappeared around the same area.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
Circular, shiny, reflective object clearly observed in sky on August 9, 2013 at 11:00 am  by several witnesses;2013-08-09 11:00:00;3.5 hours;Circular, shiny, reflective object clearly observed in sky on August 9, 2013 at 11:00 am  by several witnesses This circular shiny object that appeared to be static in the sky did not make noise that we could hear.  I first observed this object at 11 AM when I looked up into the trees.  The object that was visible to the naked eye seemed unnatural to me.  I called the attention to my adult daughter who agreed that we were not looking at something that was man-made.   I called 3 other people over to see this thing and they also had no explanation as to what this object was.   I also phoned my husband who, with several co-workers who work at the local college, went outside to see this UFO.  They had no explanation of its origins.  They even observed it through a high powered telescope and it still appeared to be shiny, circular, and reflective. I went home and was unable to see it at 2:30 as there was now a cloud-cover in the area.  I will look again after the cloud-cover dissipates to see if it is still there.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
Two bright dots, moving west to east, viewed in a telescope;2013-08-09 12:15:00;1 hour;Two bright dots, moving west to east, viewed in a telescope At 11:45, on August 09, 2014, a  police officer at Merced College asked me (I am an astronomy Professor), what the object in the sky is.  He pointed to a bright dot of light that was approximately at zenith and a magnitude brightness of about (-2).  The officer said that he was reported about the object about 15 minutes earlier.  The skies were clear blue, and the sun was bright, almost at zenith. I set up the colleges 5 inch Celestron telescope with a 20mm objective. Under magnification, the object was indeed a disc with what appeared to be a set of “lights” in the 0-90 degree quadrant of the circle.  Another astronomy instructor, 2 more police officers and several students observed the object as it moved from zenith to the west.  It covered about 25 angular degrees in the span of about 15 minutes.  We took photographs of the object with cell phone cameras through the telescope. While watching the object, an officer saw another, similar object coming in from the east, at about the same magnitude brightness.  The object moved westward, until it was at zenith overhead and then continued west.  The time it took to travel from an altitude of about 80 degrees to zenith was about 10 minutes.  We observed this object under same magnification, and saw a silvery disc, with the same “lights” along the same quadrant. Both objects left our view, passing westward.  The entire viewing time was about 1.5 hours. Our working hypothesis is that we saw Mylar balloons, or weather balloons, with the sunlight reflecting off the “dimples” along the edge of the balloon.

I was stopped in my tracks because I noticed a very large and very still orange orb above my roof line in the night sky. It began to move or dance around for about what I believe to be about 10 seconds. It then seemed to lose interest in me and then slowly go upward and disappear into the night sky. It was late at night and neither the town or the orb made any noise. There was no wind and I heard no traffic. I went inside and went to bed as though nothing special had happened.  I did not remember the event for two days. I don't know why and that still bothers today. I can't begin to describe how I felt when I did remember. I must have replayed the event in my mind a thousand times. I still do.  It has taken a lot of courage for me to write this because I believe my sighting is different than most people who have seen orbs.  On Friday March 1, 2019 exactly two years the day, my wife of 39 years died on that patio no more than four feet from where I stood when I saw that orb. I don't want to see another one.  So to whoever is reading this I want to thank you for your time.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
Bright white ring over Merced;2020-07-18 17:00:00;Until 5 minutes after sun;Bright white ring over Merced At approximately 17:00 Hrs. on Saturday July 18, 2020 Spotted a bright object hovering nearly directly overhead at Latitude 037 deg. 19' 34.0062 N, Longitude -120 deg.-28' -49.7484 W. Looked at object with Binoculars and it appeared to be a bright ring of light. Called a family member who is approximately 4 miles away at Latitude 037deg. 19' 52.0422 N , Longitude -120 deg. -28 -44.5434 W. He also looked at the objected with binoculars and identified it as having a bright ring.  The object remained in place as the sun and began to dim as the sun approached the horizon.  As the object dimmed I began to see a bright flashing white light in the center of the ring.  At about 5 minutes after sunset the ring had completely faded away and the flashing light was no longer visible.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124

Long line of lights moving silently across the sky.;2021-05-22 21:44:00;10 minutes;Long line of lights moving silently across the sky. We noticed a string of lights moving across the sky above our house, from West to East at pretty high altitude. We counted 30, but there may have been more. They moved at a consistent rate of speed, and they were spaced out fairly evenly, although the spaces between them varied somewhat. There was no aircraft noise of any kind. We tried to record video on a phone, but the individual lights were not bright enough to show up. We watched until the lines of lights ended. It was very eerie.;37.3027561643836;-120.485828767124
