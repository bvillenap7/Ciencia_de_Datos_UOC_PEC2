Huge, neon green fireball with orange halo travelling very fast perpendicular to earth in northern CA;2007-08-11 00:45:00;3-4 seconds;Huge, neon green fireball with orange halo travelling very fast perpendicular to earth in northern CA Two members of the band, myself a newspaper publisher and our keyboardist, a school teacher, were driving home heading south on I-5, going 70 mph, at about 12:45am, when we had a huge, bright neon green fireball appear, going incredibly fast from behind us and disappear behind the mountains ahead of us all in about 3-4 seconds. It had a reddish-orange halo around it and appeared to be at least as large as a house if not much larger. When we arrived home 20 minutes later in Mount Shasta, two more band members who were 10 minutes ahead of us on the highway were waiting and excitedly asked, Did we see it? and described the same thing. The fifth band member called, he was in a third vehicle and was on another road, old highway 99 to Gazelle, and had also seen it.
