It was around 330am and I had been looking up all night because the stars were amazing.  Directly east, I saw a light way off in the distance, which I first thought was a star but it began to move.  My second thought it was a shooting star because it was dropping but then it  made a sharp left, then straight back up. I had to rub my eyes to make sure it wasn't an illusion.  My next thought was it was a satellite, but then it dropped straight down again.  All of this was happening in the same location, and I knew this because I was using a star for reference.  Once my brain realized what I was seeing I woke people up and it made a left and took off faster than any aircraft would and covered a huge distance in a matter of 1 second.  My friend caught the last bit of it.  I have seen UFOs before in northern Michigan and Washington (which only hovered) but I've never witnessed any aerial gymnastics like this.  I kept thinking maybe it's government craft because I was in the middle of the desert, but who knows;35.0053;-117.6627
