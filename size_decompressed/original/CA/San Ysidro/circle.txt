Circle with red and white lights.;2015-12-31 17:30:00;5 minutes;Circle with red and white lights On New Years Eve at approximately 5:30 pm in San Ysidro, CA, near the Mexican border.  I was outside facing the Eastern sky.  I noticed something with red lights ascending into the sky.  At first I believed it may be an airplane, given that there is a nearby airport.  However, I soon realize that the airport is located in a different area than where this was ascending from.   I watch as the object moves closer west.  At some point the object stops and hovers over a residential area approximately ten or fifteen blocks away from me more or less.  At this point from what I could tell I was looking at  a circular disk type object because what at first seemed to look like a red light began to spin and show  red and white lights all around ,2 red and two white.  The object made moderate moves from left to right twice while spining and began hovering kind of like when you spin a coin on a table and it starts to slow down. it continued side to side slowly then i tried to record ! it but my phone cam coincidentally didnt allow me , I got an inssuffient  storage alert . i called family to tell them to go outside and look but as soon as i began telling them the ufo began to descend and disappeared into the horizon, almost as if it landed or got lower to the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  PD));32.6291;-116.99138
