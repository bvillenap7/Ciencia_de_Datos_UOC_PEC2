Suspended lights on the northeastern sky of Mexicali;2003-09-09 22:00:00;15 minutes;Suspended lights on the northeastern sky of Mexicali I live in Mexicali, across the border from Calexico, in Mexico. I am driving parallel to the border and my wife asks about to lights that are showing in the norhteastern sky. One on top of the other at about 30 degrees from the ground. Then some smaller lights start to appear - they resemble to things- either something lights turning kind of what one would think a flying saucer would look like, but also it appeared to be kind of like when you see on TV that an airplane is shooting fire and that the lights kind of follow the path. It was really akward because I tried justifying that they were the lights from the customs port, but then I realize that they were to high to be lamps and that they were to bright and colored white to be antennas.;32.6864;-115.5033
