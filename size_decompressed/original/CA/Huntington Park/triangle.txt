What I saw was amazingly undesirable as there were about 6 or 7 objects forming a > shape with equal number of objects on each side.  As it left very quickly it seemed as though one side acquired more objects and they had no lights as if it was trying to hide from being seen.   was a second bigger object right after the first group but this one was a very large triangle with 3 rounded lights one on each corner but the lights weren't bright at all.  I could still see the entire object but those ones emitted no sounds.  It followed the same route as the group of objects before it.  One more star like object followed the second on the same direction towards the Pacific Ocean.the speed of the last object was very fast but definitely not a asteroid.  I watch the sky for hours and know when an asteroid or airplane passes through.  These items were ei! ther military grade or aliens really exist.;33.9794000000001;-118.2176
