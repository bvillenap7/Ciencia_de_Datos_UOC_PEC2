Long bright red triangle.;2013-12-25 19:45:00;2 minutes;Long bright red triangle Extremely bright pulsating red (long narrow) triangle heading south, moving slowly, then fast, then slow, fast, slow, then stopping.  It started dimming then shot off at a tremendous speed. No sound, not a plane, blimp nor a helicopter. It may have been at 2000 feet and sure seemed very large, way larger than local military aircraft that are often seen.  I've never seen or read about anything like it.  It didn't have red lights, it seemed to be a big long triangle shape that was very bright red.;38.4037;-122.3637
