Bright green orb/fireball traveling straight down to earth.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Orionid meteor??  PD));2015-10-23 22:46:00;5 seconds;Bright green orb/fireball traveling straight down to earth Was driving home from work. It was a state highway but because it was after 10pm in a farming community there was little traffic.  I was in an area with very little artificial light when high in the sky I noticed an unusual light.  Looked up to see a bright green orb/fireball traveling what appeared to be straight down.  My first thought was a firework, but it seemed to be moving at a pace quicker than a firework would free fall.  I followed the ball of green light with my eyes for approximately 4-5 seconds until I lost it to the horizon.  The car in front of me must have seen it as well because the road was wide open and they broke hard and pulled over.  I've lived in the area for 5 years.  I've driven this road alone after dark at least 3 nights a week and never seen anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Orionid meteor??  PD));38.4037;-122.3637
