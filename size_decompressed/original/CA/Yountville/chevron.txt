While driving north on Highway 29 in the Napa Valley, my wife spotted an array of lights high in the sky a distance to the west. There are tall hills in that direction. It looked like a single row of stadium lights and, initially, I thought it could be lights of top of the hills in the distance.  However, my wife pointed out that they were too high in the sky to be on a light pole.   The night sky was black and clear.   Then we noticed that the lights were moving towards our location at a slow rate of speed which told me it was not an aircraft making an approach into Travis AFB, nor do military aircraft have anything more than running lights.  As it came closer, we could make out a shape (I called it a flying wing or boomerang) and the entire forward edge had white lights from end to end which did not appear to project a beam.  We noticed that other drivers were beginning to pull to the side of the road to observe the object.  We did not stop. As it passed nea! r us to our left, we got a good look at the underside as another array of red lights went on behind the white lights.  The red lights appeared to go off and on randomly.  It was a large dull colored craft which seemed to blend with the sky, it was moving very slowly, and it made no sound.  From what I know about aviation in this country, we have nothing like it in our national inventory.;38.4037;-122.3637
