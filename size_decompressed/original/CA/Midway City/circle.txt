I stared at it trying to see any type of blinking red blue lights.  Nothing but what looked orange.  I started to record it with my phone.  I got a few seconds of the object in the air, and it went through some dark clouds.  I kept my eyes and camera in the location and noticed something black descending coming out of the clouds.  The lights were shut off.  The way is was descending was also not normal.  I have never seen or heard of any flight vehicle shutting off its lights in midair while descending in mid air.  Wish it was easier to send my video to someone who knows more about this stuff;33.7461;-117.9909
