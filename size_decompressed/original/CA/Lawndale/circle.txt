I noticed 6 small circle shaped craft, not moving in the sky.  They were well above the small aircraft which was a Cessna. I continued to look as long as I could. I then began looking for the child that I came to the park with.  After locating her I looked back in the sky and trying to re-locate them in order to show them to other people at the park, however they were no longer there.  There is no question in my mind that I saw what I saw.;33.889;-118.347000000001
