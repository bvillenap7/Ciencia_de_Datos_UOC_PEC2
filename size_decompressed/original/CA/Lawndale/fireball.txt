I heard no sound with its’ flight.   (I had seen a similar flash on 6/28/13, but it had a w-h-h-h-sh sound – which I never reported, expecting to see something in the news.  But, I didn’t.) The flight I saw lasted approximately 10-30 seconds, before disappearing from my sight. It was much larger than the stars, that I watch, but much smaller than the moon (but as bright). It sort of had a fish or fireball shape, was bright white, sparkling and very fast.  Also, the tail seemed to be flashing or dropping off, but not getting any smaller, to my naked eye.;33.889;-118.347000000001
