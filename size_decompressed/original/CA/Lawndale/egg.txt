At around 9:00pm August 5th, 2013 as I walked out of my house I saw an airborne object traveling from west to east.  There was a layer of clouds coming in off of the ocean and I only saw it for a moment as it passed through a gap in the cloud cover.  It appeared to be made of a dark material and had a dim pulsing red light beneath it.  At first I thought it was a helicopter but the lack of sound and rotor caught my full attention.  It had an oblong shape to it, sort of like a football.;33.889;-118.347000000001
