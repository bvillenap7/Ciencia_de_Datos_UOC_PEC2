PD));2015-11-07 18:01:00;15 minutes;Driving through neighborhood to find parking. Spotted greenish/blue/whitish light in the western sky.  Nothing else around it.  Originally thought it was a helicopter because of the brightness but it wasn't moving.  Shining like a car headlight.  Then defused. And slowly dimmed over 15 minutes until it finally disappeared.  Confirmed sighting made by three people with two neighbors, and friend who lives further south.  Friend reported that they saw the beginning of the light, they saw a white light with a defined circle around it very similar to a helicopter, then it changed into the green blue oval that we saw.
