My brother saw a little man.;1969-11-01 07:00:00;10 seconds;My brother saw a little man. One morning in either late 1969 or early 1970, my six-year-old brother told me that he had seen a little man just outside his window.  His bed was just under the window, which looked out onto the front doorstep area.  I was eight at the time, and I pressed him for details, but all he could tell me was he had seen a little man.  The house we lived in at the time was at the very edge of a brand new housing development, very near the top of the hill.  Just over the hill was nothing but rolling hills, rattlesnakes, jackrabbits, and a horse stable.  This area would therefore have provided the perfect place to land undetected, and was within walking distance of our house.  To the little man, I am sure our neighborhood would have seemed like a new human colony which had just sprung up. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.510043902439;-117.659070731707
