chevron shaped lights fly silently over San Juan Capistrano at high rate of speed;2008-11-15 19:30:00;15 seconds;chevron shaped lights fly silently over San Juan Capistrano at high rate of speed On the above date and time, I was standing in my backyard. As I looked into the sky, I noticed lights from an airliner traveling nortbound. Moments later at a much lower altitude (probably 5,000' or less), I observed a series of dim white lights in the shape of a chevron. The lights were proceeding in a northwest direction towards the ocean at a very high rate of speed. Initially, I thought it was a formation of fighter jets however as the object flew closer, I could see that the the lights were fixed and part of the object. I then thought that it might be a stealth fighter, however the object was completely silent. I am a former police officer and currently own a private investigation firm. I have never been a UFO buff nor have I ever paid much attention to all of the books and shows about the subject, however I know what I saw and it certainly was not an airplane.;33.510043902439;-117.659070731707
