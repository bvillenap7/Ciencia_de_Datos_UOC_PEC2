Rapid moving white light seen flying beneath full moon, 9-14-2008, from San Juan Capistrano, Orange County, CA;2008-09-14 21:50:00;5 miniutes;Rapid moving white light seen flying beneath full moon, 9-14-2008, from San Juan Capistrano, Orange County, CA Six of us were playing cards and were on a smoke break out on our street when I decided to take a picture of the full moon with my iphone. Looking in the camera screen I noticed a small white light dancing back and forth beneath the moon. It moved side to side, one moment on the left side of the moon, the next moment it moved across the sky to the other side of the moon. It was moving below the moon forming a U shape around the bottom of the moon. It's movements were rapid and jerky, kind of like how a fly moves. We couldn't see this with our naked eyes but 3 of us did see it with the camera lens. It was a very clear night and many stationary stars were visible. The shape of this object was circular, it looked like a star that was moving very fast across the sky. I can't believe it was an aircraft as I've never seen anything of this earth move like that. It was very erratic in it's movements. It was a bright white color, that of a star in the sky. My Background: A lifelong belief and interest in ufos as my family and neighbors witnessed ufos over Westchester, Calif when I was very young..but old enough to remember the excitement. At that time, my father reported this sighting to ufo folks and they had an official meeting at our house that included people from Hughs Aircraft. A long time listener of Art Bell and others, I have long been aware and interested in ufos in a serious and open minded way. This is the first time I've ever witnessed anything like this or reported any such sighting. I did email a ufo guy in Orange Co. here via his webby mufonoc -Mutual ufo Network OC;33.510043902439;-117.659070731707

They were moving straight across the sky and the wind was blowing pretty strong in the opposite direction.;33.510043902439;-117.659070731707
