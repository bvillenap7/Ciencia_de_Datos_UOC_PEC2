Shape changing UFO and ultra florescent light show at dawn.;2009-05-14 21:00:00;30;Shape changing UFO and ultra florescent light show at dawn. Me and two co-workers had just got done with a job. Stopped in at his hotel where he was staying. Electricity went out. We went outside and seen whole valley was out. Little boy of his neighbor's said look at that kite in the air. I looked up and saw something with different lights changing shapes. Doing all sorts of turns. Almost looked like a peace symbol at one time. My friends along with all his neighbors saw this object and watched it for a very good while. It was light yet, it was just starting to go down. This is no lie and no hoax. I was faintly tripped out to see someone filed a report about the same incident. Yet we saw a little more of the beginning. I have seen plenty in KY where I was raised part of my life. I am a vet as well. Seen my fair share of weird stuff. Things that would make ya go humm. I have a piece of metal stuck in my lower back. I can recall bits and pieces of an encounter when I was seventeen years old. I am thirty years old now. I cannot remember alot of things but if someone is reading this. I just need answers to what it is exactly they want? I have a picture of this thing on my phone. Don't know how to send it email. Date time and everything.;33.7932037735849;-116.958122641509
