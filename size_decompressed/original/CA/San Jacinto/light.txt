Red light In San Jacinto, CA.;2008-09-24 22:00:00;Approx. 10 Seconds;Red light In San Jacinto, CA. I was walking in a field with two friends on September 24, 2008.  It was around 10:00 pm.  I looked up and saw a red light shoot into my view, hover for a few seconds, and then shoot off. It looked as if it was only a couple hundred feet above the ground.  Only one of my friends saw it too.;33.7932037735849;-116.958122641509

My daughter asked me dad whats that over there on top of the mountain?  i looked out the window an noticed a bright light hovering above the very peak of the mountain.  I have an unobstructed view of the San Jacinto Mountains, Looking out my family room patio doors.   At first,I assumed this object was a plane or helicopter. Unlike a plane or helicopter, it had no flashing lights.  The object hovered in place atop the mountain for 30 seconds and what followed amazed me.  After hovering for 30 seconds over the mountain it just disappeared but, when it disappeared it left a flash of light that petruded from the peak of the mountain down on both sides, it was amazing.   Its like it petruded visible enery as it vanished.;33.7932037735849;-116.958122641509
Bright light craft flew with no sound.;2014-04-07 20:05:00;2 minutes;Bright light craft flew with no sound At approximately 20:00 hrs on April 7th, 2014 (San Jacinto CA), I was sitting by our front porch having a cigarette and talking with my brother.   I looked at the constellation Orion by chance and then I seen a bright light come from the right side of Orions belt and leg.  It just blinked on very bright and travelled West to East.   There were no beacon lights or navigation lights to be seen.   It then took a slight curved path that then went North East.   I noticed a very small vapor trail.   This object gave no sound (piston plane engine or jet noise) that could be heard.;33.7932037735849;-116.958122641509
White star-like object moved from SW To E then decended North and shot straight up while changing red.;2014-10-04 19:55:00;1 minute;White star-like object moved from SW To E then decended North and shot straight up while changing red. On Saturday October 4th, at 7:50pm in San Jacinto CA., I went out to have a cigarette with my brother..  We were talking and I noticed a bright white star like object in the South West sky at about 33 degrees above the horizon at about 7:55pm., I saw it start to move thinking it may be a jet.   As we kept watching the object kept moving from the SW to NE.  We did not observe any strobe lights, navigation lights or hear any engine noise.  We both noticed the object wobble and descend.   Then the object started to come towards our direction still descending.  The object stopped then immediately shot up in altitude and the light became red, pink then went out and changed back to red (very small) as it went out of distance in a great climb in altitude.;33.7932037735849;-116.958122641509
