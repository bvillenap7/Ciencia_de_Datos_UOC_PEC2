Dark triangular object seen over San Jacinto, CA;2006-09-26 19:30:00;20 seconds;Dark triangular object seen over San Jacinto, CA The object moved in a straight line from southeast to northwest and about 45 degrees above the horizon.  Triangular would be the nearest to the choice of descriptions, but it was more like the shape of a stingray.  It was dark, brownish in color, and had a slight glow on the edges.  The movement was smooth and silent.  This sighting was made as I was observing the sky from my backyard and having just thought I had seen the ISS pass over from the same direction.  However, when I checked for the ISS sightings from San Jacinto I found that it had not passed over at that time.  This object was similar in description to one I had seen years ago in May 1980 in the area of Shasta, CA.  I am a retired teacher.;33.7932037735849;-116.958122641509
