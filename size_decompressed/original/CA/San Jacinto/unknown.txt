The witness was laying down on the sidewalk faced towards the mountains. The object was moving at a very high rate of speed. It moved in an S shape and then continued in an Easterly direction and then it became impossible to see any further. The observation lasted  about 20 seconds.;33.7932037735849;-116.958122641509
