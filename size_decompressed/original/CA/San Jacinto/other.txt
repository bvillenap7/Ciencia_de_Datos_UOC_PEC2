Last night 12-10-07 at 20:45 I was driving south bound on Ramona Express way and right before Old Mountain Road, All the lights when out on the west side of me.  Than as soon as I got to Old Mountain Rd. All the lighting in my truck dimmed out the Radio station tuned out and went dead and so did my truck.  Then the lights on the east side of me also went out this was all with in 5 second and it almost looked like a black pointed shadow flew from of Old Mountain Road across Ramona Expressway to the east side of Ramona Express Way, right in front of my truck than disappeared in the huge open field.  It almost felt like time stopped because everything around me went black!  I got a really weird feeling and so did my boyfriend, than the lights inside my truck turned back on and all around me the lights started going back on and the radio station started tuning back into the station it was on.;33.7932037735849;-116.958122641509
