Orange lights.;2013-12-18 18:00:00;4 minutes;My daughter and I were driving into our neighborhood and I saw 4 square object in a formation of 2 on top and 2 on bottom of each other.  Each made up of orange lights...none were flashing.  When I went to take a photo 3 had gone into the distance so far I could barely seen them!  One was still hovering ...not moving.  I got one photo of it before it disappeared...again when I looked down at the camera!  The photo I took was not what I saw.  The photo shows this bright ball of light but within the light there is a definite outline of some sort of craft.  I wish my daughter and I would have grabbed my camera and took video or pics before they left!  But we were too busy freaking out.   It was definitely not a plane or helicoptor.  There is also nothing there in the area of the sky where it was hovering...no trees or mountains!;33.7932037735849;-116.958122641509
