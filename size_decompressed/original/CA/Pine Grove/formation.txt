As me and my extended family were sitting on our front porch after dinner, just chating away, we noticed 3 large white lights come from the western horizon and stop instantaneously overhead.  The rate at which they traveled was estimated by us about 400 mph.  When they stopped, they hovered for about 3 min. and pulsated, then they shot off towards the east at 2 to 3 times the speed by which they came from the west.;38.4016;-120.6571
