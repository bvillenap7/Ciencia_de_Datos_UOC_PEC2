While driving along, approx 10 or 11 pm, I-5 was pretty deserted, it was the middle of the week.  I noticed a car pulled over to the side of the shoulder, and then a few hundred feet further another car pulled over to the side of shoulder.  The passengers of this second car, two people, a male & female were standing in front of their car with a flash light pointing it straight up towards the sky and turning it off & on, like they were signaling to something.   I thought what the heck are these people doing???  I slowed down and had to lean over the wheel and look up to my right to see what they were signaling to.  Once I saw, I immediately pulled over to the side of road also.   I pulled over about maybe 15 or so car lenghts in front of this car and immediatley turned off the engine and lights and then began to watch the object.  The object was to the right of my car, approx five or six car lenghts off the shoulder and then approx about a telephone poll and half up into the sky.  I can't measure real well in approx feet which is why I'm using objects to describe this.   The object that I saw was so close to me and so close to the ground but yet it just hung there, no sound or vibration at all, absolute silent, and very, very, big. I am very hesitant to give all the details over the internet however, I will say that in looking over your site I found one VERY close and similar incident which follows -          Occurred : 7/17/1996 01:35 (Entered as : 07/17/1996 01:35)  Reported: 1/17/2004 4:37:11 PM 16:37  Posted: 1/22/2004  Location: I-5 (Firebaugh Exit), CA  Shape: Diamond Duration:15 min  What I saw, and I know the other two people saw as well , was a triangle of lights. Becasue this incident was so close to me there was absolutly no mistaking what I saw.  I know that this was a craft of some sort, however, not something of our world.  I'm no expert but I feel very confident that planet earth does not possess the capabilities to do what this craft did.  Additionally, the entire time I watched this object I had the very distinct and real feeling that someone, or some thing,  was watching me back.  I'm posting this today becsue of the sighting that I referenced above.  This happened to me at approx the same area.  I was just about 2 or 3 miles from the Firebaugh exit on I-5.  After viewing this object, which eventually traveled straight up into the cloud covering and disappeared, I immediately drove to the first gas station there at the Firebaugh exit and phoned my mother to tell her what had just happened. This experience happened to me in 1987 almost ten years ago, however, I remember every detail as though it happened ten minutes ago.  I would like an investigator to contact me if at all possible as this experience bothers me a great deal.  I simply can not forget it.

3 white bright lights shaped liked disks coming in a straight line;2019-09-27 23:00:00;5-10 seconds;Driving on the highway 5 going north, there was 3 white bright lights shaped liked disks coming in a straight line, it looked like it was coming straight to our car on the highway it was very close (less than half a mile away from us). As it got closer it went up and changed shape to a triangle and changed it's path to go right. It flew away so fast and changed shapes again.;36.8654;-120.4692
