White light flashes at Mercey Hot Springs, yet again!;2015-07-13 21:54:00;2 seconds;White light flashes at Mercey Hot Springs, yet again! Another night soaking at Mercey Hot Springs, looking at the numerous stars and planets.  I've seen whatever this is occur about five different times now at various evening times, during different seasons over the years.   This time my brother was there with me and also observed the phenomena.  It's a bright, silent white light that flashes anywhere from one to four times per instance.  They are brighter than the planes going by or the stars in the sky.   This time they were in a different part of the sky, and it happened two separate times.  As I have seen this occurance before, we were watching and waiting for it to happen, and we weren't disappointed.  My brother conjectured that they are maybe meteors coming directly at us?  But, we really have no idea what they are.   This is the first time I've observed it twice in one night.   We also saw readily indentifiable planes, meteors and satellites, as usual on a clear night.;36.8654;-120.4692
