Small orange triangle making impossible high speed maneuvers;2007-07-17 01:45:00;4 minutes;Small orange triangle making impossible high speed maneuvers As written by my son who was the witness of this incident. At approximately 0145 the morning of July 17, 2007, I witnessed an  object traveling at great speed move west to east across the nights sky. This object would then come to a complete stop without slowing down,  turn 90 degrees, and move north to south at a slow speed. The object would  pick up speed, and then would start making very tight, perfect spirals  while traveling very fast. In the center of the spiral, this object  came to a complete stop again, turned 90 degrees, and then head east to  west at a slow speed, then disappeared. It did this a few times while I  observed this object for about 4 minutes. The object was made up of three orange lights that formed a small  triangle. The maneuvers I witnessed were things that I have never seen  before. The high rate of speed, the sudden complete stops, the 90 degree  turns, and the tight, perfect spirals led me to believe that what I saw  was a UFO.;35.2609;-116.6962
Triangle Shape Object With About 14 Orange Lights;2012-02-06 20:52:00;10 min;Triangle Shap Object With About 14 Orange Lights My back yard is looking into the training area here (Known as the box). I was looking over towards the training city of Abu Layla and saw this group of bright orange lights.  Looked to be about 14 or more lights in a triangle form.  The lights were just hovering above the road out there. After 10 minutes of watching this the lights headed east towards the I15 freeway and you could see the glow of this object silhouette the mountains.  When it took off it had to be going faster then 600mph becuase it only took about 5 seconds for it to disappear (figuring the speed by the time and distance).  When it took off it went from a stand still position.  This is my 3rd time seeing it here in the same spot.  I work in this area every day, and there is nothing but Desert out there. I have 2 pictures I took with a Point and Shoot camera, but they came out blurry due to the distance and are not 'really' helpful.;35.2609;-116.6962
