I just got out of the car, and looked up at the big dipper, and this object moving a crossed towards the north, In a fraction of second it disappeared and reappeared 20 to 30 mile north of that point.  Just in moment reappeared, it shot downward towards the west indescribable speed, and it was extremely bright.  The sphere size was increasing as it was descending towards the west.  No plum behind the object, as you do see behind meteoroids, I saw just one complete bright sphere descending.;34.2525453798766;-118.288312114991

The object went up and down very quickly in a perfect ascend and descend.  It then went from west to east in a slower motion but covering lots of ground in a short time.  Have not seen this pattern before.  Saw it with naked eye looking northwest toward the mountains and the sky;34.2525453798766;-118.288312114991
Daytime Sphere along the San Gabriel Mountains.;2017-06-22 10:00:00;15 minutes;Daytime Sphere along the San Gabriel Mountains. Morning hike, spotted a round pullsating metallic looking sphere gliding along & slightly above the local foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.   First thought it may be a party balloon, but it eventually stopped moving and remained aloft and stationary for at least 10 minutes, then slowly receded out of sight.  Fascinating.
