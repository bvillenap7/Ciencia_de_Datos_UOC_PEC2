Plasma rocket or alien spacecrafts?;2006-04-09 09:00:00;??;Plasma rocket or alien spacecrafts? I snapped this picture of a departing cloud system, and I noticed this area above the clouds.  I didn't see it when I took the photo.  I took a program and zoomed into it, and saw what looked like a PLASMA rocket zooming away.  There seems to be another object right next to it!  I wish I saw them when I was out there.  Been out all morning, nothing.;33.9951999999999;-117.5219
