40+Lights seen in daylight with spiral formation of 25+ lights over Mira Loma,California(Ontario,CA);2001-02-05 15:30:00;20 minutes;40+Lights seen in daylight with spiral formation of 25+ lights over Mira Loma,California(Ontario,CA) I Live in Swan Lake,Mira Loma,A mobile home park.Out walking around i noticed about 10 Points of light in the Clouds about 80 degrees high.  I ran home as quick as i could and grabbed my Digital Camera to get a picture. When i ran back outside, I noticed that about 30 more lights appeared in the sky.Looking at the objects,I was so stunned.In fact i almost forgot to take a picture of the flying objects.Now the werent lights,they were shiny objects in response to the sun.About i would say 25+ of the objects suddenly moved into a formation seen in the picture i took,that you should get along with my report.As you can see,the formation is a spiral of some sort. with very unique dots to the left of it.I think those dots mean something, Maybe mathematical or something else?;33.9951999999999;-117.5219
