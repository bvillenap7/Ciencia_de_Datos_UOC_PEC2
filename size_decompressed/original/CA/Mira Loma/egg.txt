About 10 seconds later an Egg Shaped Shiny Silver object Came into view next to Venus in my Field-of View. Moving very slow coming down i was amazed. I looked up away from the telescope to be astonished by a brilliant shining light moving down into the SW sky. I ran inside to get my brother.We came back out to notice that the object was now Low in the SW skies id say about 20 degrees high from the SW horizon.I panned the telescope over to see it again but this time the brilliance faded tremendously until it was gone.Id say the Object was Black and when the Sunlight hit the object,it Reflected Silver Shining light back toward the observer.What a Sight! regards, ((name deleted));33.9951999999999;-117.5219
