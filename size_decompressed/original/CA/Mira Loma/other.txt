a fire trail and fire ball explosion about 20 miles southwest of large airport - possible magnetic effects.;2008-07-22 21:20:00;6 second +/-;a fire trail and fire ball explosion about 20 miles southwest of large airport - possible magnetic effects. Driving south on Interstate 15 when I saw a very large fire streak appear in the sky.  I would have thought it was a falling star in the way it came across the sky but it was much much wider and more colorful and it took perhaps5 or 6 seconds before it exploded in a fire ball and then the sky was totally dark again. Because of the width of the trail and the size of the explosion I had the feeling it was rather close to earth.  I had no way to estimate height or distance.  I did need to look up through my vehicles front window to see it better. It may have been a large meteoroid but being that close it must have caused some damage.  Strange thing is that my cell phone screen was all scrambled when I went to call home and tell my husband about it.;33.9951999999999;-117.5219
