Nine bright orange flying objects;2014-03-01 22:30:00;3 minutes;Nine bright orange flying objects Nine low flying triangle shaped objects, each with a bright orange light.  They were following each other in a line with a distance of about 1,000 feet between each object.   We could not hear any noise coming from these objects.
