Bright, erratically maneuvering object, spotted over Buttonwillow, CA - October 6, 2005 - 2:25 AM.;2005-10-06 02:25:00;still visible;Bright, erratically maneuvering object, spotted over Buttonwillow, CA - October 6, 2005 - 2:25 AM. Working in the oil fields, just west of Bakersfield, I happened to glance up at the night skies on my way to the drilling rig.  What initially appeared to be a bright star, quickly turned out to be something quite different.  Although a considerable distance from my point of observation, I could still make out a bright, pulsating white light, accompanied by distinct red and blue.  While, at first it seemed to hover in the same spot, it suddenly began moving in short, erratic bursts of speed in all directions.  I first noticed around 2:25 A.M., and it's still there at 2:50.  I'm not aware of any terrestrial aircraft capable of such maneuvering and while I'm sure that it can be explained by some logical means, those of us who witnessed the object had never seen anything like it before. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a celestial body would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witness was observing a genuine UFO.  PD));35.4068;-119.467
