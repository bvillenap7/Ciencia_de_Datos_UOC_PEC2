Large glowing cylinder object don't know what it was, don't wanna know;2000-01-18 01:00:00;20 seconds;Large glowing cylinder object don't know what it was, don't wanna know I was driving down 7th standard road heading for the Buttonwillow & I-5 truck stop. When I turned down Tracy to head for the truck stop my car died on me. I slowed to a stop & heard a strange electrical type humming sound, I looked up & there was a cylindrial shaped glowing object out & over my cars hood. I was scared but I had to get a better look at it so I got out of the car & I looked up at it & then I got a flash of symbols & crazy pictures in my head. Then the next thing I knew it started to take off, slowly at first then it took off fast. I was so scared after it took off that I got in my car & drove it at a speed of 120 mph to make it too the truck stop. When I got there I noticed it took me 20 minutes longer than it usually does to reach the truck stop. My watched stopped when I reach the truck stop & looked at, it still doesn't work even with a new battery. All I know is this took a lot for me to write let alone remember cause I hate remembering it, & I NEVER want to see that thing again.;35.4068;-119.467
