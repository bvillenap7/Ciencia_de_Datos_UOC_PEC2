I felt something watching me, when I looked up a light came on approximently 1/4 mile away, and then it darted straight at the ground at incredible speed, although it left no light trail and no sound.;41.579;-124.0351
Bright light Thanksgiving night  2010;2010-11-25 22:00:00;10 minutes;Bright light Thanksgiving night  2010 Hi, I was driving home from my uncles house in Eureka CA on Thanksgiving night 2010.  I was alone and driving on highway 101 between Orick CA and Klamath CA.  Between Orick and Klamath on Highways 101 it turns into a freeway and you start to go up the mountain and once you get to the top you can see the mountins around you.  I noticed a very bright light towards my right side.  I stopped and tried to take a picture with my cell phone but it did not turn out very good.  The light was super bright and lit up the top of the mountain it was on.  I could tell you that it looked like a flood light that is used to light slides on roads.  There are logging roads which are locked off to go over in that direction.  I could not tell if there was a road over on the top of the mountain where the light came from but I did find it strange that there would be such a bright light on a Thanksgiving night on the top of a mountain in the middle of no where.  There were other cars on the road and I ! know they also would have seen it since it was so bright.;41.579;-124.0351
