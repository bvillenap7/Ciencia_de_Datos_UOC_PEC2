Red, blue, and white light flashing rapidly the object stayed steady in the sky going up, down, left, right ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD);2012-06-17 03:30:00;1:30;Red, blue, and white light flashing rapidly the object stayed steady in the sky going up, down, left, right, I was staring out my window at some lights from a ranch and then I got my binoculars to make sure they were nothing more.   As I’m staring at them I noticed to my left was an object flashing red, blue and white.   My first initial thought was an airplane because it was moving from left to right just like one.  I go back to staring at the lights at the ranch looking for any awkward movements.  I set my binoculars down to look for the airplane and to my surprise it was in the same spot that I had seen it last, so now I look at it more careful and I noticed that it was flashing more like strobe light and not like an airplane, and that’s when realized this is not airplane.   I then looked at it with the binoculars and noticed it would get smaller and then bigger, I also saw it moving up and down left and right but not in that sequence.  So then I decide to tell my girlfriend I’m looking at a UFO, she didn’t believe me and demand that I went back to bed.  I didn’t know wha! t else to do so I called 911, after that my girlfriend is now interested knowing more about this object. When she saw it she noticed the same things I noticed.  After that we kept our eyes sharp on it but as dawn was approaching the object soon disappeared, within seconds.  But the rapid consistent flashing never ended;36.4221;-121.3224
