Two perfectly vertical frosty white trails of light in the night sky.;2014-08-28 22:28:00;4-5 seconds;Two perfectly vertical frosty white trails of light in the night sky. West Hills, California, Thurs., 1028 pm, 08-28-2014.   Sitting in my back yard looking to the north in about the 10 oâ€™clock position.  Two frosty white streaks appeared.  Just for a fraction of a second they seemed to be falling vertically downward.  Then stopped and stayed stationary.  After 4 to 5 seconds they disappear quickly. They were right next to each other and perfectly parallel to each other in a vertical orientation of 90 degrees.  Each were slightly wider at the bottom than the top kind of resembled what you could describe as a comet tail and were identical in shape and length.. I estimate that they were 20 to 30 mile away.;34.1956989473685;-118.6466
