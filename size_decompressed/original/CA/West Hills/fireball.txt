Slow fireball, low in the sky;1994-12-26 19:30:00;5 seconds;Slow fireball, low in the sky I was at the West Hills Medical Center with my wife. My daughter was born earlier that day. We were sitting in the room by the window after sunset. A streaking yellow-greenish ball flew through the sky very low at a moderate speed. We thought we would see a crash explosion, but it just vanished with no other visible signs.;34.1956989473685;-118.6466
