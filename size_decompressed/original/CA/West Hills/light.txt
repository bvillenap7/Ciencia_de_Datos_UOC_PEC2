bright whitish-blue light traveling north over castle peak.;2003-09-22 19:30:00;1 minute;bright whitish-blue light traveling north over castle peak. allright here it goes...I was working out on my weight bench staring straight up at the sky when I observed a bright whitish-blue light traveling at a low altitude in a northern direction. normally this wouldn't be a big deal because I live under the flight path of Burbank airport.when I saw this lightit was traveling north in a tight S curve type of pattern...not quite a zig zag but smoother. what really freaked me out was the absense of sound.look I live in the far west end of the san fernando valley and there is almost always some kind of air traffic sound(helicopters-airliners at low altitudes)and during most of this there was a relative quiet. there was no sound from this thing.I watched it travel untill it flew beyond my roof line.again there was no sound and it was luminated from all side's.the whole event took maybe a minute or two of time.this is not the first time i have witnessed strange thing's in the sky traveling above the neighboring mountains(the same moutain's Rocketdyne/Rockwell are situated in.)so this time I decided to report it.I would have to say it was about as high as a jetliner on approach. it was pretty bright and because of that I can't see how other's could not have witnessed it.        Thank You.;34.1956989473685;-118.6466
Single crystalline light in sky, changing colors, moving slowly.;2013-11-02 23:08:00;2 minutes;Single crystalline light in sky, changing colors, moving slowly. A crystalline, bright light that seemed to have no substance was observed low in the western sky.  The light changed color from red to magenta to purple to blue and appeared to be like that of reflected laser light, having a somewhat grainy quality.  The colors seemed highly artificial and unnaturally monochromatic and pure. The light appeared stationary in the sky, changing colors, then slowly moved smoothly and laterally to the right (north) for a short distance.  Then it moved back to the left (south) in such a way as to suggest that it was unstable, like a radio-controlled helicopter being poorly operated.   Finally, it moved south and disappeared behind the tree line.

Strange greenish, bright light, off in the distance making right angle maneuvers.;2017-10-22 20:38:00;8-10 seconds;Strange greenish, bright light, off in the distance making right angle maneuvers. I was looking to the north from my back yard, in West Hills California, a little bit above the tree line, I estimate 25 to 35 miles out, I noticed a light that I didnâ€™t really think much of at first.  But then I realized it was moving around odd way and it was a constant light that was not blinking off and on, it was bright and greenish in color. It moved up then down, then to the left then, up again, then to the right, then down, then to the left, then down, then to the right, then up.  These up, down and side to side maneuvers were all sharp right angles.  Then it disappeared as if the light just turned off.;34.1956989473685;-118.6466
Two bight objects slowly wobbling across the sky before disappearing fast.;2019-06-05 21:20:00;1 minutes;Two bight objects slowly wobbeling across the sky before disappearing fast. At approximately 9:20 (sic.  p.m), as i was getting out of my car i saw what looked like a bright star slowly move across the sky heading south/east, before disappearing at a blink of an eye.  Moments later another light that resembled a star, was slowly moving from south to north, it was slowing down then speeding up and it appeared to be wobbling. My guess they were at least ten miles above earth.;34.1956989473685;-118.6466
