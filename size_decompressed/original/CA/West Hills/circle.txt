And she responded that I was crazy and seeing things, the light disappeared for a split second and it once again appeared, now not more than 100 ft. away, I asked her again did you see that? ,and she responded once again that I was crazy, so this time I had time to take 5 pictures which only 1 came out. The funny thing is my neighbor still does admit seeing it. The second time I really thought that the light was coming toward me, and I ask myself why is it that my neighbor couldnâ€™t see it. I then had the strange feeling that I was going to get abducted. The light disappeared on an unvalibable speed to the west. I hav! e the the picture, and is clear that this was not a helicopter, or fireworks, take a look at the picture and you can see the landing gear, and something coming out of the the left bottom opening of the ufo, that created the light, see for yourself and be the judge of it. This was 4th of July, and I am sure I was not the only one that saw it.;34.1956989473685;-118.6466
