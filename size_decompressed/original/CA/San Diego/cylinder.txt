Cylinder object, sighted on Naval Medical Center spys on music festival for all to see.;2000-04-16 14:00:00;35 Minutes;Cylinder object, sighted on Naval Medical Center spys on music festival for all to see. I was at a music festival in front of the San Diego Aerospace Museum just enjoying myself and my friend put her shoulder on my arm to point out the Cylinder like object floating about 100 yards away. It was right across the street facing Southeast, right next to one of the buildings in the Naval Medical Center. The object was only about 100 feet in the air and made absolutely no movement. At about the same time some other people attending the festival began to take notice of the thing. One woman said it looked like a floating trash can. I started making my way towards the object and ran to the opposite sidewalk about 60 yards from where I was standing. The object still was in the original spot still and now I could plainly see that the bottom of the cylinder rotated in a counter-clockwise motion, and the top portion rotated clockwise. It was definitely made of a metallic material, and had a sort of box like protrusion on one side. I just sat there with my jaw gaping open and so did about 20-25 people around me. One Hispanic man was video taping it, while about 4 or 5 people were taking pictures. Then after about 30 minutes the object slowly moved around to the back of the building and was never seen again.

While flying over the coast of San Diego a silver blimp like object with an orange stripe across the top of it was seen sitting stationary atop and inside of a cloud.   It was seen from above.  It was not moving.  It had no wings or tail fins.  It was larger than a blimp but am unsure of size since we were flying over it.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Many bright rotations of cylinder air crafts.;2016-03-31 04:00:00;90 minutes;Many bright rotations of cylynder air crafts. It was about 4 or 4:30 in the north when I arrived at seaport village.  As I sat down to look at the view, I looked up and realized there was many stars.  Some were brighter than the other like a gold shiny cylinder.  As I was watching them I noticed they were moving.  Not just in one direction, in various.  There was different sizes and colors.  Two other people walked up and sat down beside and I had told them, 'do you see what I see?'  They both said yes in amazement.  I have seen other encounters with space crafts but this one was the by far most interesting.  As if they brought an army of them.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
A white cylinder, silent, not moving, then poof...gone.;2021-07-25 14:00:00;3 minutes;A white cylinder, silent, not moving, then poof...gone. While out for a walk on a clear, cloudless day, I noticed a pure white cylinder shaped object in the sky. It had no wings, tail, or any visible means of flying, was silent,was not moving, or was barely moving/flying at all so as to appear to be sitting still. I watched it in that exact same spot for several minutes when suddenly, it either blinked out or left at such a high rate of speed that my eyes could not track it. It reminded me of the white tic-tac object seen by pilots, shown on TV some time ago, but was not moving.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
