flash like daylight lit up everything for 1 second, not lightning;1987-11-15 02:00:00;1 second;flash like daylight lit up everything for 1 second, not lightning I was driving down a city street early in the morning & all around the car the world lit-up like daylight- I was really scarred & it happened again about 30 seconds later. The next day a friend called me to tell me about seeing a UFO- He said that he saw two giant lights in the sky followed by a huge explosion. He was about 30 miles south of where I had been, but we calculate that both events happened around 2am. Very clear night! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Flashing Orange Lights accelerate with each jump and were parallel to each other;1994-08-01 17:30:00;30 seconds;Flashing Orange Lights accelerate with each jump and were parallel to each other I don't know the exact date or time, but I remember we were walking to go see a movie of Columbus because it was the 500th anniversary of discovering the new world.  My friend and I were walking East in Occean Beach, CA around sunset.  I saw 2 orange flashing lights on the Eastern horizon.  I grabbed him by the shoulder and without saying a word I pointed to sky.  These lights flashed and then made a jump towards the South.  They moved parallel to each other and after making an inital jump they appeared to jump back to the spot they had jump from before.  Each jump forward and backward increased their speed until they were moving faster than anything I've ever seen.  I don't think this was an asteroid because it was moving slowly at first and then accelerated.  Plus there were 2 bright pulsing lights that moved parallel from North to South.  After the lights disappeared I asked him what he saw and he smiled and said you know what I saw.  My friend called in the report to some one over the phone, but no one else saw what we saw.  Most people were probably looking West at the sunset.  We see figter jets all the time in san diego, but this was no jet and this was no rocket either.  We were too far away to see the shape of the craft.  I would estimate we were 15 to 20 miles away.  These lights covered and an amazing amount of distance and were still excellerating when I lost sight of them.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Star-like light streaks across night sky;2003-02-20 19:45:00;5 seconds?;Star-like light streaks across night sky The time of this sighting is approximate. I was out walking in my neighborhood and I saw a bright star-like light in the east just blink out. It was white, no red or green blinking lights.  It was as if someone just turned it off. Then a couple of seconds after that, a white flash went across the sky from east to southwest.  It appeared as a streak of white light and moved incredibly fast.  There was no sound at all.  I could not tell how near or far, or how large the object was because it looked about the size of a normal star.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Bluish white and incredibly fast object witnessed over San Diego between cloud cover.;2008-01-27 18:00:00;10 seconds;Bluish white and incredibly fast object witnessed over San Diego between cloud cover. On January 27th, 2008 at approximately 6pm, I was exiting my fiancée’s mother’s house in San Diego.  My fiancée was already seated in my car.  As I rounded the car to the driver’s side, I opened the door and proceeded to get inside.  Before I had entered the car, I glanced upwards (in the fluid motion of getting into the car, my head looked upwards) and saw the object.  There was low cloud cover, and the clouds were slightly lit from either the moon or the sunset, although not brightly.  Between the sporadic cloud cover, I witnessed an extremely fast bluish-white light traveling from my left to right.  The object appeared to be relatively low to the ground, but above the cloud cover.  There was absolutely no noise.  The first time I saw the object, it lasted for about 2 seconds.  Since I could see the trajectory of the object during that time, my eye continued along the sky to where it would have been if it were not obscured by the cloud covering.  A few seconds later, I witnessed it again between the clouds in the same color and speed as previously seen.  Since I am familiar with fighter jets in this area of San Diego, I am familiar with the relative speed at which they appear to be traveling to the ground observer.  This was significantly faster, and without the usual accompanying sound that jets make.  Additionally, it appeared that the object was completely glowing, or possibly I could only see the flame produced by the object.  It may be important to note that I have better than 20/10 vision, somewhere approaching 20/5 vision.  In the short time I saw the object, I could not see anything traveling in front of the object, such as a rocket, although this could be possible.  Also, the “flame” appeared the have a gradient of color from white at the top to blue at the bottom, not from end to end as might be expected from a jet or rocket flame.  Also, in comparison to the diameter of the flame, this would be an unusually long flame, as it appeared to have a length approximately 10 times i! ts heigh t.  Also, although observed very briefly, the ends of the object appeared to not be pointed, but rather slanted toward the top of the object.  There didn’t appear to be any trail left by the object, although it was so bright that visually it left a slight optical trail.  This was far brighter than what you would expect even a full moon would reflect off a reflective object.  The moon, however, at that time, was below the horizon and not visible.  Sunset had been approximately 45 minutes earlier.  I will e-mail a diagram showing my best estimate at the distances and my position at the time of the sighting.  The red arrow on the diagram shows my position and direction of viewing.  It may also be helpful to know that I have never reported a UFO, nor do I claim to ever have seen anything unexplainable before.  Honestly, this seemed to possibly be something manmade, perhaps the Aurora which I have heard about.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

The object would flash for several seconds then dissapear, then would flash again for several seconds.  This lasted for about 15 minutes while the object traveled through a short span of the sky (comparable to the distance between the shoulders of Orion).  It seemed much slower than a satalite and was definately not a plane.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Bright human/diamond shape seen over the Pacific Ocean from San Diego area then disappeared;2009-01-17 21:00:00;10-15 Minutes;Bright human/diamond shape seen over the Pacific Ocean from San Diego area then disappeared On the night of January 17, 2009, a family member pointed out an outstandingly bright light in the sky over the ocean. The night was perfectly clear with not a cloud in sight. Two other family members walked outside and saw the light. I personally stood there for five minutes to gaze at it. At first I thought it was a planet I never recognized before, but I knew that to be false after about fifteen minutes.  At first it was just a bright light, but after staring at the center it looked almost like a cross or even a human shape.  Four spokes (for lack of a better word) sticking out from a main frame.  There were rays of light coming from all sides.  These rays seemed to be rainbow colored and white at different times. It was hard to tell if it was moving or if it was just my eyes, but it seemed like it was moving slightly.  Like I said, about fifteen minutes later the light disappeared and that was the last I saw of it.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
White flash of light zipped across night sky from southern direction towards the north and blacked out instantly.;2009-08-29 02:00:00;Half of a Second;White flash of light zipped across night sky from southern direction towards the north and blacked out instantly. Witnessed a pure white colored flash of light zip across the sky starting from the South heading North and immediately blacked out before it got close to the horizon line.  There was no fade in or out whatsoever, and seemed almost like a path of light that was turned on and then all of the sudden off after a certain distance.  Appeared just over the coast line of San Diego and blacked out most likely just above Escondido area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

When I first sighted it,it was approx. 2 degrees west of the star Diphda(16 beta Ceti)and it passed north of Diphda by a degree or two as it moved north east.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Big laser like neon=purple light shoot out of horzion.;2012-03-15 19:00:00;5 seconds;Big laser like neon=purple light shoot out of horzion. On the night of mid- March 2012, I was walking home from the local store right after sunset. I live near the Mexican border in San Diego and I was facing south towards the horizon listening to my iPod when I notice a big green jolt of light shoot out of the horizon. It reminded me of something you see in Star Wars, the light changed from green to blue to purple, spreading across the night sky in a window shield wipe effect. I was so taken back from what I’ve saw, I stopped and looked around in the parking lot I was in and no one was there.  I saw a woman in a parked car and ask if she seen anything strange, but her back was facing from what I seen. She laughed and I laughed too (out of nervousness). I was still stunned from what I seen and trying to understand what I saw that lasted 5 seconds. As I was walking out of the parking lot and I saw two women who I passed by earlier while I was walking to the store. I asked if they so that light in the sky. They said they saw it also, I can tell they were scared and confused. We spoke for about 5 minutes trying to understand what we saw.  I went home still in disbelief. I know this wasn’t just some earthly phenomenon, something in my heart tells me it was something I will never understand. I tweeted what I saw asked if anyone in my city seen it. I got a response from some who lives about maybe 5 miles from where I saw it and she seen it too. I checked for the local news that night and no mentions and nothing from the Mexican news. The next few days I checked online and couldn’t find any reports. I tried to do some research of what I saw, but also couldn’t find anything close to what I saw that night. It’s something I will always remember and these typed letters cant justified what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Bright flash, then very dim, like a dim satellite, then bright flash again.  Tonight I used my binoculars after the 3rd flash but didn't see the object again.  I checked to see if it could be the ISS but the site says it will be at 0430 and moving N to S.  This object moves W to E.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

San Diego UFO Videos of White and Black craft.;2020-05-15 18:47:00;5 minutes;San Diego UFO Videos of White and Black craft. I have video and would like to be contacted..  I was sitting in the hot tub with a friend when I noticed a bright white light very high in the sky. I went inside to grab my phone and capture the bright object.  When I reviewed it frame by frame I also detected a black object moving at high speed.  I have both object in two videos.  I did not see anything in the third video and I also took two photos of the blue sky, but didn't see anything in them. The day before this happened a similar object was reported in Japan and the day after (I think) about 50 of these same object were spotted in San Diego.  I have the fast moving white and black object in video.  I think the white object might have emitted a trail of smaller white ones.  The white objects were high in the sky, but the black one may have come closer.  I was facing about East, but one of the black one may have come from the North or West over my house.  Please call me this is a real and I want you guys to check it out.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
