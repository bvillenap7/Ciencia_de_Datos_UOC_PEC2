The silent object had three orange ball-shaped lights that seperated from eachother as it flew over the mountain.;1989-08-01 23:00:00;1 minute;The silent object had three orange ball-shaped lights that seperated from eachother as it flew over the mountain. Seven friends (male) and myself had walked down to the neighborhood lake one summer's evening. We were hanging out in an area that overlooked the lake. As we were sitting down on a ledge talking to each other, I noticed an object flying straight at about 60mph and 300ft in the air on the other side of the lake (about a quarter mile away). At first it looked like the lights of a plane, but as I kept my eyes on it I noticed that there were no blinking lights just three orange colored ball-shaped lights. At the time nobody else was paying attention to it because it sort of blended into distant street lights, but when I realized seconds later that there was no sound coming from it, I pointed it out to everyone saying check out that plane, Its not making any sound. Everyone watched as the object flew another 30 seconds until it was over a mountain about a half mile away. All of a sudden as the object was over the mountain its three ball-shaped lights slowly seperated from eachother downwards onto the mountain. All of us were stunned as the balls disappeared behind the mountain and today fourteen years later, all of us are college educated professionals and yet we still refer to the event as the UFO.

Two military members sighted two red lightsnorth of downntown San Diego.;1996-04-05 21:00:00;60 seconds;Summary : Two military members sighted two red lights north of downntown San Diego. The two of us were in a position on Fifth Ave in downtown San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter about two blocks from the convention center.  We were on the first floor of a building on the south side of the street.>From our angle near the window, we could see over the top of the buildings to the north of our position.  People on the street were screened by the opposite buildings, and people farther inside the room where we were could not seeout over the buildings due to the low overhang of the window.Both of us, at the time, were in the Navy base stationed in San Diego.  Both of us held jobs in navigation. We were usedto using our eyes to identify far off lights. I have heard over the previous four yearsmany stories from veteran sailors, of many instances in the last few decades that ships have actually followed {or been followed)by UFO's on the open sea.  Before this happened, though, I was unsure of the truth to many of the stories.  Whilelooking to the north over the buildings across the street, I noticed two, bright red lights up in the sky.  What caughtattention is that one of them moved back and forth across the sky in an extreme fashion, though the arc of movement wassmall, maybe two or three degrees.  The speed with which the object moved was incredible.  At this time I pointed it out tomy friend  He also looked up and was immediately transfixed.  I am unsure of the exact length of time that we watched the objects, because the event was eleven months ago, but it was probably about sixty seconds.  During that time the two lights would hover for a few moments and then move in formation.  At the end, they both accelerated away at a very high speed. Aftertalking about it for a few days, we soon dexcAfter we witnessed this, we looked around to see if anyone else had been watching.  As mentioned before, we were the only onesthat had a vantage point.  We tried to think of any possible explanation for the sighting. We quickly eliminated jets orhelicopters, celestial bodies, or reflected light.  We had no idea what the lights were.  At the time, I did not really know anybodythat we could tell.  I recently bought a computer.  I soon found this site.  I decided to let you know about the event, albeit late.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Three Light Formation in Point Loma;2007-11-23 19:00:00;3 - 5 Minutes;Three Light Formation in Point Loma Three lights in a vertical line, alternating brightness and color while moving, but staying in uniform shape for a number of minutes. My friend and I both saw this while on the corner of Sports Arena Dr and Rosecrans at a red light. They were to the south, directly above the Chipotle restaurant. We saw them for at least 2 minutes, they moved quickly when all lights were off, as the lights came on in sequence, we would see them in a location either to the left or right of the original location. The formation was very large, the lights spread in a uniform distance from each other. They pulsed between white and pink or reddish. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Three lights changing formation;2007-11-23 19:45:00;2 minutes;Three lights changing formation My family was out for a walk when we noticed three very bright yellow/orange lights in the sky to the west.  They appeared to be stationary at first in an obtuse triangle formation - the middle one equidistant from the outer ones. They then slowly moved so that the middle one was closer to the top one. They were getting lower in the sky and eventually moved into a tight equilateral triangle formation. We were walking away from them at that point, but when we turned around a few seconds later, they were gone - either got too low to see over the houses or faded out.  They appeared to get slightly dimmer as they descended, but it may just be that the sky was not as clear down so low.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Two objects over San Diego, Ca.;2008-02-17 13:30:00;20 minutes;Two objects over San Diego, Ca. Two craft in formation approximately 40,000 feet, possibly higer. Craft appeared to be round then oval then round again. One craft kept moving away, then coming back. If you looked away then looked directly at the object, in could not be seen until after a few seconds had elapsed. They moved east, then west, then south. One craft left, then the other craft changed and became a very bright red and pulsated. I was watching with binoculars. It had white around the outside and appeared round. It appeared to be lit from the inside, but was difficult to tell. As it glowed, it pulsated. The craft continued to travel south, then was just gone. Shortly after the sighitng I observed a commercial jet pass ovet at about 35,000 feet with a contrail. The jet was easily identifiable. The craft were not.

Two orange lights in formation over the community of Clairemont in San Diego at  8:35PM PDT;2008-03-16 20:35:00;15 minutes;Two orange lights in formation over the community of Clairemont in San Diego at  8:35PM PDT Over the Clairemont community, in San Diego, CA. Viewed 2 bright orange lights.  Moved independently and then in formation.  Left object moved very slowly north to south.   Right object moved to slowly to the WNW and then stopped and moved toward the left object.  Then both moved slowly in unison to the SW for 2 minutes then stopped.   The right one faded quickly as if pulling away into the distance and disappeared.  The left one faded slowly as if into the distance until was also gone.   The 2 bright orange objects were witnessed by my wife and I.   By the time my mother-in-law left came outside the house, she witnessed only the one remaining orange light go dim and dissappear.   Initially the lights were extremely bright, brighter than an airplane.  There was no blinking or secondary lights.  No sound.   The organge color of the lights and the fact they were not moving was what initially caught my eye.  Wife caught pictures of one of the lights on a small digital camera but it doesn't give indication to much other than the color of the lights.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

My friend and I looked up and saw a formation;2009-07-14 12:35:00;25 min;Walking back from lunch noticed 2 other people on street looking up on a clear blue sky.  My friend and I looked up and saw a formation of 8 bright circles high above us.   Starting on the Left side, one object followed (going right) another one a little distance away.  A middle cluster of 5 (2 on left side of cluster, 2 on right side of cluster and one that seemed to move around the other 4 making different shapes even a triangle with 3 together).   A lone object was farther to the right farther than the distance of any of the other groupings together.   No noise, very high in sky drifting North.  Immediately in 20 minutes 9 aircraft from MCAS Miramar launched and headed North (usually launch West over ocean).   The formations of the middle clusters continued to move and change shape while remainder 3 always held position.   Took photos with cell phone camera, am not sure if they came out clear enough yet.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Formation of 3 objects over Garbage Beach in San Diego.;2013-08-13 02:00:00;45 minutes;Formation of 3 objects over Garbage Beach in San Diego We parked at Garbage Beach, and immediately spotted a triangular shape with a large blue light in the center, and changing colored lights moving around the main blue light.  It slowly moved from the center of our view, to the right.   Another appeared as a large glowing orange ball.   The second one moved in towards the first after the light patterns changed, like it was communicating.   We could hear a low humming.   A third object arrived in the center of our view.  It appeared to be cloaked, but also communicating with the other two.   All three then aligned into one row, before the first two passed by each other and flew in opposite directions.   The center object stayed in the same spot until we got out of the car to get a closer look.  It retreated, but then returned to its original position when we moved back.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
UFO Fleet Observed Passing Over Tecolote Shores Park Near Mission Bay, San Diego.;2016-04-02 13:45:00;30 minutes;UFO Fleet Observed Passing Over Tecolote Shores Park Near Mission Bay, San Diego. While flying kites at Tecolote Shores park, I happened to notice a fleet of 20-30 UFOs in the sky that appeared very similar to images and video of UFO fleets over Mexico City.  These craft seemed very high altitude since planes passed near them and were obviously well underneath the UFO swarm.   The UFO fleet appeared to be made of craft that were somewhat round and seemed to either reflect white light or create their own white light.  Individually, they appeared like points of white light in the clear, bright-blue, early-afternoon, southern California sky.   Also, some of crafts appeared to be larger and brighter than others.  One of the larger craft was observed emitting a smaller/dimmer craft.  Some of the smaller/dimmer craft were in tight formations and created geometric patterns like the three corners of triangles or triangles with an exact center light.   Over about 30 minutes the fleet drifted from the eastern sky towards the West.  The fleet expanded and some ! witness claimed they saw some of them suddenly disappear.   A few people tried to get video or photographs, but the kites in the sky and overall sunny early afternoon conditions would not allow our phone cameras to zoom in enough or focus on the formation.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Formation of 12 steady white lights floats from west to east, slowly ascending, over Mission Valley, San Diego.;2016-05-21 21:45:00;15 minutes;Formation of 12 steady white lights floats from west to east, slowly ascending, over Mission Valley, San Diego. While starting to drive my car away from a party at 9:45 pm, Saturday, May 21, in the Mission Hills area of San Diego, I saw what was like a constellation of bright white stars, maybe about 12, in the area clear of trees above the street, towards the west.  I thought to myself, What’s Cassiopeia doing there, and the Big Dipper, too low in the sky and in the wrong direction.   I pulled my car over and got out, and saw that the lights were slowly moving from west to east. Seeing them in motion was quite a shock. Not planes, not helicopters, just steady bright white lights floating slowly to the north of where I was, from west to east.   I ran back to the house and told everyone to come out to see what was happening.  The 15 or so still there came outside onto the driveway and sidewalk to watch the show.  The lights seemed to be drifting, slightly changing position in relation with one another.  They seemed to be slowly ascending as they moved east they neared the posi! tion of the full Moon, which had risen about an hour or two earlier.  They gradually faded from sight.  A retired policeman was among the witnesses.   Our guess on the most mundane side was that they could have been balloons with attached lights, launched from Ocean/Mission/or Pacific Beach and were riding the nightly onshore breeze which was taking them to the east, directly over Mission Bay then Mission Valley to our north.   I later went to Ocean Beach and asked fishermen on the north side of the pier if they had see balloons launched from the long stretch of these three above beaches to the north, but none had seen anything.  I recall seeing in the news a similar report of floating lights a year or two ago, also in San Diego.   I was just visiting in San Diego for the weekend, from Minneapolis, for my brother’s memorial service.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

A third light did the same, and then a fourth.  After they were all lined up in a row, the lights quickly went out, one after another, starting with the first. They didn’t seem to come from anywhere.  We didn’t see them flying from a distance to land in this space.  It was like they appeared, moved into place, and then disappeared just as quickly.

Three objects in exact formation;2020-04-30 11:30:00;5 minutes;Three objects in exact formation The sky was clear,solid blue with no clouds. While out walking my dog, I stopped at our usual place to enjoy feeding birds, enjoy nature and look at the sky. Suddenly, I spotted three dark, identical sized/shaped objects to the far NE. They caught my eye because they were in an exact formation, a row across with the exact amount of space between them. At first, I thought they must be military planes or helicopters in a pattern. As I watched them, though, they did not appear to move as the never became larger, coming towards me,or smaller, moving farther away. Also, they remained in the exact formation, all three staying the identical size. That is when I realized there was no sound of planes or helicopters. It was silent. As I tried to think of what they could be as I observed them, poof...they all three suddenly disappeared at the exact same moment. The formation was too far away to determine their shape. Discs were the closest description. The next day, th! ere was a great deal of military plane activity heard for some hours. The base happens to be to the NE.
