I saw a UFO in the night sky over Pacific Beach in San Diego, & while being trailed by 2 jets firing tracers the object turned north on;1970-10-15 23:00:00;1 minute;I saw a UFO in the night sky over Pacific Beach in San Diego, & while being trailed by 2 jets firing tracers the object turned north on. July 2009 My UFO Experience:  I was walking up the sidewalk/steps to our south facing home on Law St. in Pacific Beach (San Diego, Ca 92109) in 1970 or 1971, I think about 11 to 12pm when I glanced up at a cold clear night sky & saw a large craft the size of a blimp perhaps with many lights (in fact all I saw were the lights, no outline of the object) approaching to my right & slightly to the north moving silently from east to west.  It was being trailed by two fighter jets (I assume from Miramar Naval Airstation or North Island) that were shooting tracers towards it.  This obviously grabbed my attention.  I had never seen tracers other than in WWII documentaries. As the craft came to be directly in front of me (well above the roofline of the house to the north), it turned north on a dime and accelerated & vanished in an instant.  I realized that it was a UFO when I saw it streak towards LA like a bullet & disappear.  The two jets, which I could now hear, continued to follow by slowly arcing to the north.  The pilots had to be as totally mystified as I was. No man made craft then or now could have made that maneuver.  I thought about reporting this to some authority like the police or the newspaper, but it was late & I just went to bed.  I told my family & friends the next day & I combed the San Diego Union to see if anyone else had reported this but found nothing. This is by far the most incredible & unexplainable thing I have ever witnessed, and to this day I can still visualize it like it happened last night.  I have never witnessed a remotely similar event & to my knowledge, no one has ever reported seeing a UFO over San Diego. I have always wanted to notify an appropriate organization to see if an investigation could locate a Navy report which had to have been filed by the pilots, perhaps two per jet. From that point forward in my life I have always had a tremendous interest in UFO sightings, documentaries, stories, etc. I have had a lifelong interest in the manned space program (I  still have an old scrapbook of news & magazine articles about the Mercury, Gemini & Apollo programs) as well as astronomy & the knowledge constantly evolving about the Universe. I loved the movie Contact so much that I read Carl Sagan’s novel which was just as awesome. I have watched some UFO programs on the Discovery Channel & I believe there were several very well documented UFO sightings/encounters near Catalina Island or the Channel Islands around this time.  I have been wondering if there is a connection between those events & the one I witnessed.  I would love to discuss my experience with a relevant organization in the hopes that it sheds new light or somehow furthers our understanding of this type of phenomenon.

Faint star-like object became larger and sat over the ocean for at least ten minutes.;1976-07-01 23:30:00;30 minutes;Faint star-like object became larger and sat over the ocean for at least ten minutes. I was traveling from Minnesota with a friend.  We were both eighteen years old and did not have much money so we were sleeping on the beach (Black's Beach).  My friend had gone to sleep in his sleeping bag near by and I stayed up to look at the stars.  I liked to watch satellites going by when away from city lights.  I spotted what I thought at first was a satelllite straight above me.  It was very faint at first and going in a straight line heading west. But then it suddenly changed direction. It began heading southwest for a time.  Then Northwest.  Each change of direction happened instanly i.e. not in an arched tradgectory but more like an instant change, if that makes sense. At this point I woke my friend and he watched it with me.  After doing these maneuvers for ten minutes or so, it began to get larger and move toward the western horizon over the ocean.  It finally came to a stop just above the water. At this point it was quite large, perhaps the size of a nickle if held straight out.  It was a white, glowing ball. It just sat there for about ten minutes.  Then it began to ascend again and grow smaller. After a while it just faded out and disappeared.  Even thought this happened a long time ago, I still have a vivid recolection of it because it had a big impact on me at the time.  It did not fit into the profile fo any aircraft I could think of and its maneuvers were beyond anything I knew of.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
I saw a blue streak across the sky.;1978-07-12 22:00:00;15 seconds;I saw a blue streak across the sky. I was standing by a railroad track looking up when a blue streak arched above me. The next day there where reports on the radio telling people to report this to the national center for u.f.o. studies. I did not do so. One year later I went back to the site withe a friend. Where we met a man named ((Name deleted)). He was camping on the very spot where I saw the sreak. He had a bike with a trailer that was called the blue streak. He also claimed to be chased by u.f.o.'s all his life. There's a little more to this regaurding our meeting with him. I would like to know if any more sightings of blue streaks have occured. And if anyone knows of this ((Name deleted)) man.(I think he's from canada, and was a teacher);32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Man driving car with nephew enveloped in white light of high quality. Man observed no shadows even under dashboard. Man could not look ;1985-06-30 22:45:00;4 seconds;Summary : Man driving car with nephew enveloped in white light of high quality. Man observed no shadows even under dashboard. Man could not look above nephew's knees or  see outside vehicle though tried. Man  not scared about possible accident. Nephew remembers nothing even though he said What was that. immediately after event. Man was 36 years old and enjoys daydreaming. State employee. Prior to the event I had said to myself that I travel this section of road when going to work but this was a different time of day. Felt very alert during event , as if taking a college final exam.The event lasted more than 4 seconds because I did so much thinking while it was happening. Estimate 14 seconds based on all my thoughts. I remember thinking during the event that this light was from a star that had been engineered by intelligent  life to improve the quality of light above the quality of sunlight. Just thinking this takes 3 or 4 seconds. My nephew was 15 years old and never had any dreams he could remember. His first dream he ever remembered was when he was about 23. I slept well that night. I am baffled by the event. It isn't logical. When I drive I sometimes look off the road for 2 or 3 seconds. 4 seconds would be a little dangerous and that is why I feel the event took 4 seconds. The light came on and ! went off instantly. My nephew's feet were positioned such that his toes were slightly pointing towards the toes of the opposite foot. His heels were touching his seat. This knowledge takes time. Also,  I spent at least 7 seconds trying real hard to see any shadow. I was aware that I could not see through the windshield but wasn't scared.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Intentional formation of lights;1989-01-10 23:30:00;00:15;Intentional formation of lights I lived on Point Loma, over looking the Pacific ocean.  This is the location of the U.S. Navy's top secret submarine program as well as a major Naval instillation.  My friend and myself went outside for a smoke and I saw some lights that seemed unusual.  I am what is commonly called an Indigo child so I am very open to these types of experiences.  I felt an urgency to get down to the cliffs to get a closer look.  The ligths appeared to be about 500 yards off-shore but they did not reflect off of the water so they could have been out over the horizon (20 miles).  They made no noise and  moved with incerdible speed OR there were many of them.  What made them unusual was that they created a changing pattern of triangles.  One light would go dimm then disapear and after it did another would appear in a different location creating a perfect upside-down or right side-up triangle.  I am sorry I can not give much more deatil for sure but I can say that growing up wathching every type of military and civilian aircraft take off and land from Mira Mar (Top Gun), Limburg Field, and Coronado Island I am 100% sure that what I saw that night is either a top secret program or not of this world.

At this point, the two balls of light merged into one, and approached the cliffs. The first yellow, glowing, ball was seen heading north from the Mexico border, leaving a bright trail behind. I looked around, from a bench on the cliffs, to see if anybody on the cliffs or the pier below, saw the bright ball approach. Now looking north, I saw another yellow glowing ball, between myself and the pier, making a steep decent, then leveling out momemtarily, then rapidly decending behind a house, and down into cliffs below. I am certain that the second ball of light hit landfall. The first glowing ball was now hovering 1/2 mile out over the ocean directly in front of me. The second ball rose up into view again, hovered, then slowly flew out to join the first yellow ball. The strange thing about these glowing balls, was that they seemed to stay the same size no matter if they approached or flew off. The two yellow balls became one while hovering directly in front of the bench I was on. Next, the now larger singular ball of yellow light towards me, up the cliff, stopping 4 feet away, and about 6 feet in the air.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Man witnesses a tiny, very bright obj. moving across sky.  Obj. gains alt., brightens, remains motionless 20 min. Suddenly disappears.;1996-06-17 16:00:00;20 min.;Caller was sitting outside while speaking on the telephone.  He was observing aircraft land at Lindbergh Field.   Suddenly, he noticed a tiny bright object moving to the east, crossing the approach pattern to the airport.  The object seemed suddenly to turn, and then appeared to begin gaining altitude.  At this point, its velocity made it appear as though the object was just cruising, like a normal aircraft.  The observer, at first, thought the object was a balloon.  When it started to rise, he though that it had simply been caught in an updraft.  The object had a flashing appearance, and it appeared to have a ring around its equator.  Suddenly the intensity of the glow that emanated from the object got very bright, and it ceased moving.  It remained in the same spot for 15-20 minutes.  The observer got his neighbor, and obtained his glasses.   Then, after 15-20 minutes, during which time the object was motionless, a military aircraft approached from the north, flying south, headed in the direction of the object, and which suddenly dove very fast, like a kamikaze.  The object suddenly disappeared from sight, not to be seen again The observer called KOGO Radio in San Diego.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

I was filming the Hale Bopp comet from my front porch when a satellite appeared from the left side of the comet,flew straight through the tail and became two to three times its size in a bright glow then faded back to its original size looking very much like an ordinary satellite.Im told a satellite could not be up this high and after contacting a few magazines through e-mail I was given the approximate position of the comet on that date and area and was told there were no satellites passing at the time.Im not a big believer in U.F.O.s but what I caught on video is quite interesting,and I find it very curious that my porch light started blinking on and off a minute or two afterwards.coincidence?;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Unknown source of very intence light, with intence feelings of malevolence directed at victim.;1998-05-01 02:00:00;10 minutes;Unknown source of very intence light, with intence feelings of malevolence directed at victim. Though this event took place some years ago and I did not actually see any vehicles, it is the nature of this event that prompts me to input here.  I have rarely talked about this to anyone.  I think I've told maybe 4 other individuals. I am not a partaker of drugs and have no history of mental illness.  No history of any type of episode out of the ordinary.  I am a healthy adult male. This was a very real event.  This was a event that absolutely terrified me.  I have never, ever been in such a bad situation.  I have the chills just writing about it. I was in a remote area of the desert east of San Diego on the border with Mexico.  Jecumba was west of me by maybe 10-15 miles and Interstate 8 was north of me by maybe 5-7 miles.  I was alone in the Valley of the Moon in April/May of 1998. Before I proceed further, it is necessary to explain my usual awareness and habit when camping alone.  I always maintain a fire and sleep in about 1 hr cycles.  I wake up and stoke my fire.  It has taken me years to do this.  Force of habit and discipline.  I have a healthy respect for the wilderness and my vulerabilty despite my physical size.  I would also like to add that I consider myself intune with my surroundings.  Sight and sound.  I pay attention to the physical terrain, plants and animals that are around me.  I consider myself highy spatially aware.  You have to be.  I do some pretty hard hiking and I have to rely on my sound judgement.  I don't take risks, though I camp alone.  I'm sure of myself. I awoke to a very serious situation.  My fire was out and I had dim coals.  I was absolutely stunned.  I've never done that!  Ever! I must have been asleep for hours.  I could not see a damn thing.  Maybe a few moments later, as I busy trying to figure out what was wrong with me, the next serious situation occured to me.  There was no sound.  Nothing.  It was as if the all the sound got sucked up into nothing.  No wind and no animals.  If you have ever been alone and are used to hearing all sorts of things...hearing nothing is always a sign that something happened or is about to happen. This next part maybe a little wierd, but I get feelings.  The hairs on the back of my neck were standing on end. Let me tell you, I  got switched on. So I'm laying there in my sleeping bag next to a nearly dead fire and clutching my tire iron in one hand and my knife in the other.  I'm telling you, unknown person, that I was in serious trouble.  I felt a threat. This dawning sence of danger and threat escalated into terror.  Thats when the lights turned on. There are not words to describe to you what I felt then. I'm in a sort of cave made my rocks that have tumbled down off a small mountain.  They've piled on each other forming a shelter.  It's open in several places in the overhead and on the deck.  A powerful blue-white light was pouring in from above!  I mean it literally lit up everything.  No sound.  No sound whatsoever.  I could plainly see the angle of the light coming in at 45 deg.  It then started to orbit my little pile of rocks in a counterclockwise direction.  It was moving pretty fast. I'm an ex-Firecontrolman.  USN.  I've worked with and still work with some serious electronic equipement.  The Navy taught me a lot of math so as to appreciate how the electronics work.  Well, having done enough firecontrol problems involving range, bearing and height, I quickly had a vision of a upside down cone with me at the bottom, or pointy-end.  The source of that light was at the other end forming the circle, or orbit.  The walls of that cone formed maybe a 45 deg angle.  A best guess.  Knowing my terrain, the mountain was close to the origin, that was my present abode, was very close.  Hell, it was peppered with very large house-sized rocks.  Whatever was above me was very close.  Within a 100ft.  Maybe 75 ft.  Anymore and it would have collided with the mountain. Having been in the USN, I've been around all kinds of aircraft.  I been around a lot of machinery.  Every bit of it makes noise.  Noise from gears, turbines, transmissions, AC/DC drives/motors...it all makes a lot of noise. Whatever was at the other end of that cone making the orbit within 100ft of me did not make a sound at all.  If it was an helicopter, for me not to hear the noise of it's turbine, gearbox and transmissio,n it would have been more than a mile in the air, moving at a tremendous speed in it's orbit and somehow maintaining a beam of light at 45 deg to me through the mountain behind me when it went throught that arc. It made maybe 5 or 6 orbits and turned off and was gone. I must tell you of another quality to this event.  When I say it was gone, I could feel it.  I could actually feel it was gone.  I don't know what the hell you are going to make of all this, and this new thing regarding my sence, but I could actually feel the danger abade.  I've never felt that before.  I mean, I had a clear as a bell since that I was in very real danger, like maybe I was going to die.  I've never felt that before or since.  My life is normal.  I swear it.  I'm telling you, however, that I could feel that whatever that thing was, it was evil, bad, malevolent, whatever.  It did not have good intentions for me.  I wasn't ready either.  I'd like to tell you that I was standing on my feet with my weapons, but it's like I felt I was paralyzed by fear.  It's like I couldn't move.  I was frozen and terrified. I'd like to add that I've seen helicopters doing patrol through this area.  I suppose they were Boarder Patrol choppers.  You can hear them from a mile off.  They make a lot of noise. That thing did not make a sound. That's all I can tell you.  I didn't see It.  I'm not trying to sound proud, or something like that, but I'm a pretty intelligent person.  I know what It wasn't.  Humans can't make machines like what It was yet.  I can't say what it was either.  Sherlock Holmes said that if you have eliminated the obvious, whatever is left, however preposterous, must be the answer.  It was not human.  No one can tell me otherwise.  I'm 100% sure. Maybe five minutes later, I felt like I could move again.  The danger was gone.  I got my fire up and didn't sleep the rest of the night. Investigation of the area the next day before I left revealed nothing out of the ordinary that I could see. I've been fine since then. Like I said before, I don't have a history of drugs or mental illness.  This is the only time in my life where I was unable to explain what was happening to me.  Definitely, it's the only time I've ever been in fear of my life.  I mean, actual fear of my life. You can't have much more of an intence sensation than that. I'll never forget it.  It's not all in my head.  This happened to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Please see similar report from Fontana, CA, from late 1930's.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Then returned the same direction they came from when 2 South bound Jets headed towards them. Nov.18th '99  [about an hour after dark] To all: Tonight I saw what can only be discribed as UFO's - (4)four of them to be exact.  I swear it's true.  I just happened to be outside smoking a cigerette and was watching the big passenger liners on thier way to Lindberg field to land. Suddenly what I saw made me think: Why are the stars moving??  Four Lights, like stars started to move toward each other like this: *    ->               <-     * *    ->               <-     * Then they came together:     ** Like this:     ** Next I heard, then saw 2 Jets coming from the north in full afterburners, headed towards them.  Before the jets could get close the 4 stars/UFO's took off back the way they had come. (they were together for about 5-6 seconds).  Two of the UFO's went so fast that they were out of sight in just a couple sec's.  The other two went back to where they had been when I 1st saw them and stoped there - looking like stars again.  When these things stopped they stopped instantly!  Now for some reason unknown to me, the 2 jets went after the 2 UFO's that kept going, not the ones that had stopped(??)  The entire show happened in just about 20-25 seconds.  I kept watching but nothing else happened so I went inside as it was geting chilly. So, thats it - absolutely true. Unfortunately they were too far away to make out any kind of shape - they just looked like big lights in the night sky!  I was so lucky to look up just at the right time to see them.

Green ball of light flying up from bushes.;2000-01-10 21:30:00;10 seconds;Green ball of light flying up from bushes. I was driving south on I-163 in San Diego at aprox. 9:30pm on Jan. 10 2000. The freeway travels through the marine corps air station, Mira Mar. Its basiically three miles of darkness at night. As I was looking at the moon low on the horizon, I saw a green light shoot up from the bushes ahead of me to the right. It arced  up to about 100 ft. and leveled off then casually moved horizontally towards the freeway above me. The last view I had of it was leaning over my stearing wheel looking straight up at it. I was so deep in thought as to what the hell it was that I missed my exit four miles down the road. There was no structure surounding the light and it's movement was slightly erratic. Although I was traveling 70mph, I got a good look at it. It was about the size of a soccer ball and green like a traffic light. The air base does touch and goes routinely but in my 23 years of traveling this freeway, Ive never seen a light in the sky behave this way. My windows were up and I didnt hear any sound. I'm a 38 year old male.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
I saw a single blue-green light in the sky traveling north to south at a high rate of speed without a sonic boom or engine noise.;2000-06-26 21:30:00;3-3.5 sec;I saw a single blue-green light in the sky traveling north to south at a high rate of speed without a sonic boom or engine noise. I saw a small, blue-green light, similar to what might be on an aircraft, steady and unblinking, traveling from north to south.  I was driving westbound on HWY 52 and was nearing the interchange with I-5.  It was shortly after 9:30p.m. and I was heading to work.  There was some patchy fog along the coast, on the other side of Mt. Soledad.  I live near Miramar Marine Corps Air Base, which does have frequent military aircraft and helicopters that fly out to the ocean, and turn southward before flying back to the east.  I have grown up as a Navy dependent, and I also served in the Navy for some time, so I am used to seeing aircraft maneuvers and flybys.  What struck me was the incredible speed of this object.  I did not see any shape of the aircraft itself, only the light, which looked like a beacon.  I did not hear any jet noise either.  The object, or light, did not appear to be circling south and then east, as I would expect having seen other aircraft use this flight path.  Instead, it continued southward, and I lost it as it passed behind Mt. Soledad, which would make the object appear to be somewhere over the ocean, and even further away.  Unfortunately, I can not give a fair approximation of the distance it covered, due to it being dark, and initially when I saw the light, I didn't have a point of reference to place it near, but due to the incredible speed that the object moved in the 3 seconds that I saw it, I believe that this was not normal, whenever I have seen an jet fly this fast, I have expected to hear a sonic boom with it.  There was none.  I have tried to reconcile that an illusion brought on by the fog, may be part of this, but it still does not make sense.  I was hesitant in reporting this to you, but thought perhaps it might help, if anyone else reports a sighting from the same area at the same time and date.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Bright central white light with green triangular light in sky;2000-07-07 21:00:00;10 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Vandenberg AFB at the time indicated.  PD)) Bright central white light with green triangular light in sky I was driving home on north 15 at 9pm or so and saw a large green triangular light eminating from a cental white light,brighter than any light I have seen besides the sun.  It was shooting another narrow beam of lighter green light down to the earth over the mira mesa area.  This looked like a laser light show taking up a third of the sky when I looked westward.  There appeared to be a cloud of greenish haze surrounding the central light which moved slowly north after the beam of light stopped and the central light dimmed.  It move s to n toward the ocean and disappeared. I am a physician in the USNAVY and father of 2 children.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Red light in the sky, hovering no motion in any direction.  Blinked white light and them seemed to grow brighter and explode.;2000-08-26 21:05:00;1 minute;Red light in the sky, hovering no motion in any direction.  Blinked white light and them seemed to grow brighter and explode. At the beach at Crown Point by Sea World in San Diego.  Teenager pointed out red light stationary in the sky directly over us. Aircraft were taking off from Lindbergh so we knew this was stationary not a moving aircraft.  This was not a Helicopter, We flashed our flash light at the red light.  It responded back with a white blink which left a halo effect of white light with the red light in the middle. The white light went out and then flashed again without any further blink  from our flash light.  The white light then appeared to grow and it seemed as though the object exploded. I read the UFO sighting from San Diego Search and Rescue from July.  This episode seems to be a mirror image of what was reported at that time. We tried to determine if this was a Laser being fired from one of the local military installations but could not ascertain any other light beams.  This was a single red light without any other objects near it. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received several similar reports from the San Diego area.  The first recent sighting of a red light in that city was reported on July 25th, and it was covered by the local television news.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
SLOW MOVING LIGHT OVER SAN DIEGO, CA.;2000-11-14 21:00:00;Good 10 minutes;SLOW MOVING LIGHT OVER SAN DIEGO, CA. At approximately 2100 hours (9.00p.m.) I took my dog outside for her to do her ablutions.  Whilst outside I looked out North into the night sky when I spotted what I thought to be a bright star just above the roof top of the house behind us. I continued looking and this light suddenly became brighter and it was moving.  Seeing this light, I initially thought that it may have been a helicopter or a plane headed due South.  However, this light was moving too slowly for it to be either of these crafts.  It was just one solid light with no flashing strobe lights that are present on aircraft and helicopters.  I then thought it may have been the blimp but this light was too high in the sky for it to be a blimp.  We live about 22 miles from Lindbergh Field Airport but this light was no aircraft per se as I see them every night and this was nothing like the behavior of an aircraft. This light continued heading directly South and every now and then, the light became brighter as if slowly pulsing.  Occasionally the light would diminish a fraction but then it would come back to its normal intensity.  I continued watching it and the speed was very slow.  At one point it seemed as if it had come to a halt in mid air, but then continued on.  As it got closer I became aware that it made an acute right angled turn as it headed East. This had my curiosity really piqued, so I went back inside and got our binoculars to observe this light more closely.  I was able to pick it up and once again I saw the light increase in intensity.  As I followed it with my binoculars, it suddenly vanished completely.  I lowered my binoculars to see if I could pick it up again with the naked eye but it had gone. The slowness of the light and the acuteness of the turn told me that this was no aircraft.  What it was I do not know!  I have also witnessed other sightings and my husband and my son have also witnessed a couple of sightings  with me. This light may have possibly been a weather balloon, a satellite,  the space shuttle or something along those lines, but I feel that is was something else because of the speed of it and also the angle of path that it travelled when it went East.

Two pulsating  red lights equal distance apart moving east to west on 8/1101 at  20:53 in the San Diego sky.;2001-08-11 20:53:00;1.5 min.;Two pulsating  red lights equal distance apart moving east to west on 8/1101 at  20:53 in the San Diego sky. On the evening on 08/11/01 I was out sitting out front of my house smoking a cigar, looking at the night sky when, I noticed two lights moving from east to west. Both lights where equal distance apart,(about one and a half fingers apart at arms length) red in color and about the size of a star. The lights also had a strange pulsation to them. The lights would fade in and out, but would not fade compleatly. I asked for my wife an my sister to hurry and come out and see this. We stood out on the driveway watching the lights for about a minute and a half untill we could not see them anymore. After we lost sight of them, we went back in the house. I then started to write down the time and any relevant information. I asked my wife and sister what they saw to verify my notes. That is when I found out that the color of the lights were red, because I am color blind. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length over the telephone with this individual, and we found him to be a quite credible witness.  Satellites do not course from east to west, except in very rare occasions.  Also, given that the object was moving from left to right, as seen by the witnesses, had it been an aircraft, the two female witnesses, who presumably have normal color perception, would have seen a green light, not a red light.  Standard lighting conventions on aircraft and vessels require a red marker light on the port (left) side of the craft, and a green light on the right (starboard) side.  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  However, please see other reports for this date.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
There were 3 bright objects traveling in erratic patters.;2001-08-20 00:30:00;45 minutes;There were 3 bright objects traveling in erratic patters. Felt urge to go outdoors onto my balcony. Almost immediately I observed amongst the many clear stars, a star-like light very bright, moving from N. to S. in a very slow rate of speed and high altitude. As it moved it was erratic, going in a darting pattern at times, then a very tight circular pattern, an instant dart backwards then immediately forwards, at an extremely slow rate of speed when moving forward, the reverse pattern and circular/darting very rapid. When it arrived overhead it stopped, then continued the darting/dancing/circular tight pattern for ten minutes. That is when I became aware of two more identical lights following it, which may have been there all along but I was so engrossed in the lead light. I saw two jets at a high rate of speed/high altitudes cross the area, recognizing that the three lights were much higher than each jet. At 1:30 am they were gone. When holding my hand out straight, the distance between each object was approximately the width of the widest portion of my hand.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Bright Stationary Object off Ocean Beach San Diego;2002-04-07 02:00:00;3-4 minutes;Bright Stationary Object off Ocean Beach San Diego I was out walking on the Ocean Beach Pier. There is a great deal of commercial and military air traffic in this area, so I was watching the sky. As I watched I saw what I first thought was a regular aircraft light, i.e. a commercial airliner headlight. As I watched though the light increased n brightness. It was a lightly clouded evening and this object was positioned so that it was ringed (as though it were in the center -the doughnut hole- of a doughnut-lke cloud formation). It was a very dark night, I'm not sure if it was a new moon or the moon had already set. I could not tell the distance, but it seemed clearly too far for even an airliner light source to be so bright. Also it appeared to be stationary for the duration of my sighting. It became bright enough to illuminate the surrounding edges of the cloud formation that it was in. It grew and diminished slighty in brightness, until it eventually disappeared (it seemed to have 'winked out' rather than sped off). Very shortly after the lght's disappearence, a smaller plane, what I would perceive as a military or private sized plane (I do not know which), passed very quickly through an closely adjacent region of the sky. This craft did not appear to be the same object, but I presumed was there to 'check out' the light. I am not sure of this this is pure speculation. I consider myself a relatively competent observer (I am a visual artist), and I was a bit taken aback by the prominence of ths object in the night sky.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

It was dark at 6:15 am and the sun was coming up.  My co-worker saw a bright yellow flash in the sky and two lights off the west coast of San Diego. He said to me, Hey check this out.  When I looked up, I saw two lights and a third that had a short comets tail on it. The third one appeared alittle hazy.  It became more clear and appeared to be chasing the other two lights.  They were moving in a snake-like motion across the sky toward the south. They were no where near any flight patterns in San Diego.  As they moved across the sky, the first light had four lights moving on it in a clockwise direction. The others continued to follow it. After a couple minutes we couldn't see it any more, because the sun came up.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

It was moving in an easterly direction with a sort of light trail that would follow it then catch up to form a circular light. The object would disappear then re-appear in a different place in the sky. I don't know if one was just disappearing then another one would appear or if it was just one object. We watched it for around 5-7 minutes, then it disappeared. There wa a lot of airplanes and helicopters in the air, because it happened right near an air field.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
rapidly moving white light--not meteor or satellite or aircraft;2003-08-27 22:00:00;approx. 4 sec.;rapidly moving white light--not meteor or satellite or aircraft We two were walking South along Mission Beach boardwalk and observed craft moving South or East.  It appeared just as a white light, approx. 1/2 the (current)magnitude of Mars and covered about 20 degrees of arc in approximately 4 seconds in a straight path.  We think it was in front of some clouds at some point, so don't think it was astronomical in nature.  Was similar to a satellite, except brighter and much too rapid (as well as for any known aircraft). On the other hand, it was  much too slow to have been a meteor.  No sound could be heard, nor navigation markers seen. Very puzzling, and I have observed the sky casually and as amateur astronomer for several decades.  Have seen missile tests in the atmosphere as well, and this didn't resemble that (also doubtful such a test would be performed so apparently close to populated area).  For me (us) it was definitely an unidentifiable flying object! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be an exceptionally good, and objective, witness.

It was in the North, maybe 2 miles from me, higher and larger than a helicopter could be but lower than any planes would fly in that area. It really just looked like a bright shinning blob. It was moving very slowly upward and away from me. I looked at it at least 20 seconds. Then it flew away FAST heading North and sligthly upward, getting smaller very quickly and finally disappeared.

It appeared to be much like a falling star, although it was far lower in the horizon and it lit an area about four times as large as a star would. It was white at first, then as it sailed Southward, it turned into a lime green color, then it desended further into the Southeast and turned red before disappearing suddenly. It traveled too fast and the descent was too fast for an airplane or helicopter - and- it was too low, too big and too bright to be a shooting star.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

I was really distracted with my phone and my cigarette but when i looked up again. It quickly shoots down. And my first thought was, Oh, Wow that is beautiful.  I thought it was a shooting star of some sort. But then it gradually slowed down...and went up again kind of like a zig-zag and then it just disapeared. It wasnt until later when i realized that a helicopter or even the smallest airplane could of not manuver that fast or dissapear that quickly.

The lights were vertical to each other and appeared to be about the size of a planet sized star. The lights very slowly moved to the east then appeared to resume original position. At all times the red lights flickered continuously and stayed in a vertical position. We continued to watch for approx 20-25 minutes till one light flickered out then about 3 minutes later the other light as well.

Bright objects seen for extended periods on cloudy night.;2004-08-24 04:00:00;2.5 hrs.;Bright objects seen for extended periods on cloudy night. Bright hovering lights, observed in front of some low hanging clouds. The brightest of the objects was low on NW of field of view, other objects were scattered in a sort of triangular/chevron pattern spanning from NW to SW. Would easily have been identified as stars if not for a couple of obvious problems. The brightest and 2nd brightest remained visible inside of and in front of a large cloud formation and cast a glow inside of their respective clouds (glow in front of and behind). The brightest one would grow dull to the naked eye to the point of dissapearing completely and then become as bright as a high powered flashlight pointed at the eye from perhaps a distance of yards (very hard to discribe). The @nd brightest object (when observed by binoculars) appeared to have a small faint red object fly from it at an amazing speed. This was also witnessed by 2 friends, one roused from sleep, and the other at his night job where the light pollution made it possible for him to only see the bright one. The shapes were difficult to determine as they were very indistinct. The largest reminded me of a cylinder and then at times as a trapazoidal object, the others were the same but smaller or perhaps farthur. The small faint red dot was only witnessed by myself through the binoculars.The bright object is also in the sky now (05:12 on the 25 clear sky conditions). A smaller color flashing object is also present to it's south closer to the horizon. When the object is at it's brightest it is unmistakably 3 dimensional. I live close to the border of the Miramar base and many things have been observed over the years. I am usually held to skepticism but my curiosity has made me search for some enlightenment. I have scoured the web trying to find an astronomical answer and cannot. I do not use any kinds of drugs but am an ardent night owl. I've never reported anything at all and truly believe I've seen something unusual and hope that other people can give me some insight. I have met others from this area with similar stories.

2 red lights in San Diego New Years eve (around 11:55pm - till midnight);2004-12-31 23:55:00;3 minutes;2 red lights in San Diego New Years eve (around 11:55pm - till midnight) I was at a party for New Years at a friends house in San Diego (Pacific Beach), California.  It was 11:55pm (23:55) and we were getting ready to countdown the New Year. I was behind a bar making drinks when my friend said, You have to look at this.  So I got out of the bar area in his garage and everyone at the party in the backyard was looking up at the sky and trying to figure out what these 2 very bright dots were. They mentioned one was moving pretty fast and then just stopped.  When I went outside the 2 bright dots in the sky were just hovering in the same place.  I couldn't hear any sound from them.  They looked like a Roman Candle (firework that shots red fireballs) but very hi in the sky and were not moving.  Some of the girls at the party started to get freaked out because no one could make out what the bright lights were.  I first thought they could have been a helicopter but they seemed to be 5 times higher then any helicopter I have ever seen.  One of the lights seemed to blink a little but then stopped. I am very skeptical about UFO's and I started making a few jokes like, HOLY SH!T, its like Independence Day (Movie) and the aliens are going to blow us up!  After a couple minute, I actually started to get kind of weird about the situation because I couldn't think what the lights could have been.  About 1 minute before midnight, one of the lights slowly faded out and all of a sudden was gone.  Right at midnight the 2nd light disappeared.  It was very strange. This morning I woke up and went to www.signonsadiego.com to see if there might have been a story about it.  I typed in the search '2 red lights in the sky' and nothing came up.  So I did the same on yahoo.com and came across a news story from 2002 that started freaking me out a bit because it sounded kind of like our experience.  They had a link to this website and I noticed it had a 'report sighting' so I thought I would add my comments.  I would have never known how to report this weird event to anyone except word of mouth to my friends.  Is there any way you could somehow look into this event?  I would love to see what it could have been.  I could round up most of the people at the party if needed.  I tried to take a photo from my cell phone but you can barely make out the 2 dots in the photo.  I am not sure if anyone else took a photo.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
bright speck of light moves in strange path in western sky of pacific beach;2005-01-17 23:05:00;1-2 minutes;bright speck of light moves in strange path in western sky of pacific beach Though this happened several months ago, I had written down the date and time, thinking someone else would have seen what I did.  I see from your reports that a couplen of people saw something on New Year's Eve, however no one has reported anything for this date.  Anyway, I was walking home in Pacific Beach (more precisely, I was walking west), and in the sky I saw a little speck of whitish orange light, moving around in a random-looking way, i.e., it danced around back and forth and in loops.  I stopped to watch it, and I thought about running to go get my digital camera, but I worried that it would disappear by the time I returned.  It did not move terribly fast (its entire path was confined to a relatively small area of sky), and it had a sort of sputtery or jittery motion to it, which is to say that it did not fly smoothly like a plane does, but with a kind of shakiness.  This made me think that it may have been a meteor, but I have seen meteor showers, and what I saw was different: it did not move nearly as fast, nor did it streak in those do as those do.  Rather, it moved around in an odd little path for probably just over a minute and seemed to diminish in brightness and size as it did so, until I really couldn't follow it anymore, it was so tiny.  Again, this makes me think it was a meteor or some other object that was burning up in the atmosphere -- but do meteors move in such seemingly random paths?  Is there some way to check meteor activity for that date?  Thanks! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

After a show, we stopped to look at a light that was an odd color to be an airplane or a star. Many people leaving the Shamu show stopped to look as well. It was a bright orange light 40 degrees above the southern sky. It flashed like a bright star would, but was much bigger and maybe within 20 miles or so at least 40 thousand feet up. We realized it was not an airplane nor a star, so we continued to watch it move very slowly northbound at maybe 20 knots. After two minutes or so, it flashed much brighter than before , then it shot straight down as fast as a shooting star. Within a couple seconds it slowed down then broke apart into two bright flashing lights. The light on the left shot off farther to the south, and flashed as it faded out. The other light flashed a couple times and fell farther down towards us. It flickered once and went out, then flashed once more then was gone.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

I could see military planes in the pattern at Miramar Air Station. I noticed a white light at approximately 2 O'clock middle (not high or low).  The light appeared to be between me and Miramar.  Initially the light appeared to be stationary and looked like a star and then it took off and I saw it start to accelerate at an incredibly fast rate of speed until it was out of sight.  All this happened in less than a second.  I was flabbergasted and I had to pull over to the right shoulder and come to a stop just prior to the exit sign.  I have taken three semmesters of Calculus based college Physics and I am familiar with Newtonian mechanics as well as optics, and I have taken the Nikon school of photography.  I am a primary health care provider.  Prior to this sightening I was a disbeliever in UFO's.  I've seen numerous shooting stars, I am familiar with the F-18 Hornet, F-14's, F-15's and numerous other Fighter & civilian plane/jet flight characteristics.  I've seen missle test flights, and NASA rocket launches.  I solomonly sware that I can't account for this visual sightening based on any of my life's experiences.  It wasn't an optical illusion or reflection or something that can be explained on my perspective in relation to its course of motion.  And, it was traveling at such a high rate of speed that I can't even conceive of anything going that fast!!!  I don't know if it is a space ship or whatever it is but I can tell you that it had enough of an impact on me to motivate me to make this report which I wouldn't ordinarily do unless I think it was pretty significant!  Because it went from a stand still to an acceleration it is difficult for me to explain its flight characteristics as a natural phenomen.  I would say that it is a UFO.  The was no visible trail nor any sound coming from it that I could hear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Blue light/object sped across the sky- San Diego, CA;2006-11-08 17:45:00;1 second;Blue light/object sped across the sky- San Diego, CA I was driving southbound on the 5 freeway near the Sassafras Exit.  I was talking to a friend on the phone who was also driving southbound on the 5 freeway but she was a few miles north near the Grand/Garnet Exit.  I saw this low flying blue compact light shoot across the sky going in the southwest direction and disapper into the clouds/fog.  My first thought was that it was a helicopter and I thought how it was close to the flight pattern of the San Diego Airport and that was pretty dangerous if it was a helicopter.  As I was having this thought my friend who I was talking to on the phone said, wow, I just saw a shooting star or something and I of course shreaked and said I saw it too and then we both realized it could not have been a star it was too low and too fast and too big and it could not have been a helicopter since we saw it almost instantaneously and I don't think helicopters fly in that area due to the airport.

It was unusually brigh;2006-11-19 17:34:00;1 second;I saw an apparent meteor near the NW horizon (more west than north) traveling from right to left, and downward.  It was unusually bright (brighter than an approaching aircraft with landing lights on at several miles distance) and appeared, perhaps, to break apart just as it went out of view behind a tree.  Of the handful of meteors I’ve seen in my life this was the brightest and most impressive, particularly since it was late dusk and the sky was not yet completely dark.  The color appeared to my eye as white and did not change.  The entire time from when I first noticed a bright light in my peripheral vision to when I looked over and watched it as it moved out of my view (behind a tree) was most likely less than a second.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

It was moving parallel to the horizon, travelling from the south in a northeastern direction, over the hills east of our neighborhood. I'd say it was about the same altitude as a small plane would be, lower than the jets from Miramar. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Suddenly, a star-like light zipped by VERY fast, silently, no red or green blinking lights.  The object moved horizontally from south to northeast. I estimate it was about 1 mile as the crow flies, from where I was standing. It was high enough that I could see it above the rooftops and tall trees up the hill from where I live, but about as low as a small plane might fly. I have had multiple sightings in this area since I moved here 4 yrs. ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

San Diego Hovering/Moving Gold Light;2006-12-12 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;San Diego Hovering/Moving Gold Light I was driving to dump off a bunch of items like an old table and other furniture at a local shopping center dumpster..  I was driving on Clairemont dr heading south bound. It was about 9:30pm at night and Clairemont dr was pretty quite. I think I was the only person on the road at the time.  As I came around a bend in the road I saw a gold bright light... I did a double take cause I thought it was the police helicopter that normally is flying around my area. I couldnt make out what the object was. I noticed no other lights and the police helicopter has two lights... red and green and I didnt see those. When I first saw the object I was looking about 200 yards to my right out of my trucks winshield.  as I got closer and realized that the object was not a helicopter I then thought it was an airplane but the sky was over cast and it would have been impossible to be an airplane flying that low.  I started to feel very nervous cause I couldnt make it out. All this happened so fast that I was unable to figure out what to do.  I continued driving and I kept glancing up at the object. It didnt move an inch. When I came right up on it I noticed it was about 3 telephone poles in height in the sky.  It wasnt very big, but it was bright like a like was hanging in the sky. I lost sight of it as a drove by it. I slowed down and was trying to look at it out the back of my truck window but the furniture was in the way. I got a little further down the road and could see the spot where I saw the light over the furniture in the back of my truck and I didnt see it anymore. It was gone.  I decided to go ahead and continue to dump off the furinture and when I came back Clairemont drive I decided to go driving around the back streets where I saw the object and I came to the cayon rim and I noticed something flying around.  I thought for sure this time I was looking at a helicopter flying around La Jolla mountain. I was facing north at a dead end of a back street. I then noticed the supposed helicopter was making very sharp turns and speeding up and slowing down real swiftly.  I knew I wasnt looking at a helipcopter. It was something else.  I lost sight of this object and so I got back on Clairemont dr and continued toward my house heading north. I spotted the object again. I watched move around the sky. It was covering a distance of 2-3miles in seconds as it went around in no given pattern.  It was flying low to the ground beneath the cloud cover. When I got close to home I made a left turn and I lost sight of the object for good. I told my wife when I got home. I went out side and smoked a few times throughout the night but I didnt see the object again.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Exploding light in San Diego!;2006-12-27 16:55:00;10 min.;Exploding light in San Diego! I always see orbs of light in my area, at different times of the day.  This time it was different.  For about ten minutes, I looked up at the sky and there was this shining light in the sky,  at an east south east location.  It was wierd because the sun had not set yet and usually I can only see the moon real bright.  From were I was standing, the moon was to the right of the light.  At first I thought that maybe it was a star that was visible at that time but, I have checked and the brightest star visible from my location is Sirius, at that time it would be impossible to see.  Anyway, stars shine, and shift light when visible.  This was a stationary light, real bright.  After, about ten minutes or so the light exploded, or imploded.  It left a visible cloud of smoke and after this happened, you can see a small bright little orb falling slowly away from the cloud of smoke.  After a few seconds, that small light became stationary, then it disappeared.  A few minutes later, you can see two airplanes one behind the other fly by where this light was.  They were leaving those white trails of smoke.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Green light appears in front of my brother and I and takes off across the sky away from us.;2007-01-05 21:15:00;1 second;Green light appears in front of my brother and I and takes off across the sky away from us. My brother and I were driving home on highway 52 from the casino and we thought it would be fun to record the drive.  As we were driving a green light appeared in front of us and then disapperared.  When we got home we down loaded the movie to see if what we saw was real or a light.  We played the movie screen by screen and we could not believe our eyes.  I will take you screen by screen a light appears, sits there, it moves down the screen and dims a little, then dims a little more, then a little more and is gone.  There are 7 screens until it is gone and only takes about a second to do this.  You can tell it shows up and then proceeds to take off away from us towards the ocean.   I tried emailing the video but it would not go, if someone would like to contact me I can get you the video.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

We thought it was a helicopter which we see often over a nearby freeway.  It continued to move slowly in a horizontal direction, sometimes swirling in a circle like a balloon might.  It once almost faded out completely but then brightened again and continued to move slowly until the light faded out completely.

It was a solid white light moving North East. It moved up and down in a forward motion. It was in the sky for about 5 minuets probably less. As we watched it move up and down it disappeared there were no clouds around the object. I wonder if there were any other witnesses.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

I observed a bright star north of my location and close to horizon. It just turned off, quit shining. Not sure of what it was I kept looking at the sky and noticed faint light moving from that exact spot heading in southern direction.  Using other stars as reference I tracked the object for about 30 seconds. During that time it has moved about 35 deg. across the horizon. It then became stationary for about 5 minutes. After that time it proceeded to move again. This time the object headed approximately 90 deg. to its previous course in the south east direction. I watched it for another 15 seconds and about 10 deg.  At which point it simply vanished.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
4 white lights in a v-shape flying above the clouds across the sky in about 5 seconds.;2007-10-27 19:48:00;5 seconds;4 white lights in a v-shape flying above the clouds across the sky in about 5 seconds. This evening, Saturday, October 27, 2007 at 7:48 Pacific Time, I saw 4 lights, shaped in a tight V-shape (2 on each side), fly across the sky from North to South almost directly over me but passing slightly east of my location.  I was in a dark area near the corner of Convoy and Armour Streets in San Diego, California.  This area is directly under the flight path of Montgomery Field and a few miles south of Miramar Marine Air Station.  I have lived around the Miramar Marine Air Station for 20 years in several locations.  I have seen just about every possible plane and plane formation flying over me in this area and I have never seen anything like this.  Each light was about the 3 or 4 times the size of a normal star (so they were very obvious). A plane close enough to have a light that large would be very loud but there was no sound.  The distance between each light was about the same as each light (making it seem like all 4 lights were linked) but I could not see anything in-between the lights.  This was a tight formation.  This V-shape of lights traveled from north to south across two-thirds of the sky in about 5 seconds  (5 seconds is not a quick glance---I watched it clearly).  Tonight, at 7:48 pm, there was about 10 to 20 percent of wispy cloud cover and these lights were above the clouds but I do not know how high above the clouds.  I could see the lights through the clouds as they passed over the clouds.  The quality of the lights needs mentioning.  The lights were solid and bright but not a bright light like a star or blinking plane light.  These lights were different, maybe softer.  These lights did not blink. I guess the best description of these lights would be a slightly dim, off-white.  I say they were a V-shape but the open end would be wider than a typical V.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

On clear nights I can see the lights on the jets coming down from L.A. and at first I assumed that's what I was looking at but immediately it became apparent something else was occurring.  The lights were reddish orange, very bright, unblinking, at a tremendous height and were going up as well as northerly to southerly.  They were spaced a fair distance from each other and the leading one was higher than the other for it disappeared, fading away as it went up before the other did.  There was no noise, no blinking or strobing, and no flickering to speak of.  I look at the stars and planes and helicpters at night all the time.  I've seen satellites and comets.  I have no idea what they were but by definition they were UFO's.

Orange/yellow lights seen from Ocean Beach, San Diego, rising till no longer visible.;2007-12-22 18:00:00;5 mins;Orange/yellow lights seen from Ocean Beach, San Diego, rising till no longer visible. My wife and I were leaving a friend’s house in Ocean Beach, and I went to start loading the car with all the goodies that our 15 month needs. As always, I was looking up at the sky as I walked to the car and noticed two bright orange lights. I thought nothing of this since there are many aircraft in the area (commercial and military) and I thought the odd colour was just due to atmospheric conditions or something else.  As I kept scanning the sky I noticed that all “normal” aircraft’s lights were their “normal” colours, with the usual flashing red markers, etc. So I looked back at the orange lights and noticed that they hadn’t seemed to have moved much, nor changed in size or intensity. This was intriguing, so I kept on watching. I noticed that the lights were moving very slowly but regularly towards the south. Then they suddenly shifted direction and started moving slowly west and then north – without changing colour/intensity/etc.  There were a few other people in the front-yard of my friend’s house and I asked them to look – but they kind of just shrugged their shoulders since I was doing a pretty good Richard Dreyfuss as the realization of seeing a real UFO was dawning on me.  I ran to my car to get my video camera and by the time I got that, powered it up and pointed it at the sky – all of 2 minutes – the lights were dim but seemed to be in the same position as when I last looked. One was dimmer than the other – even though they had both been roughly the same intensity before. I shot some footage but haven’t even bothered looking at it yet, as I expect the CMOS sensor and auto-focus probably screwed the whole “capture”. The world doesn’t need yet another crappy piece of UFO footage, I’m guessing.  Anyway, I continued to watch the lights dim-out which they did over about another 2 minutes.  Later, when trying to make sense of what I’d seen, I thought it must have been some rocket or satellite boosters or something of that nature, but there were no contrails or any smoke or haze around these lights. And if they were military jets, or something of that nature, then they must have been climbing for a hell of a long time – but without making any sound at all. And their motion from earlier wouldn’t fit normal aircraft flying characteristics.  So, this was a UFO – I’d love to think it was ET and that 2008 was going to be the year – but I’ll be happy with a much less glamorous resolution to this.  BTW - I noticed that the following report, is very similar to my own: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60019.html  I am a video systems software engineer, an amateur astronomer and a hang glider pilot.

I told my daughter to turn around and look at these lights that were in the sky off the coast. I knew that it wasn't a plane because planes aren't stationary in the sky, and it was too low in the sky to be a star, there was no sound, and the  lights were red on top and yellow on the bottom, close together, one light on top of the other light. We kept walking on the pier and continued to look back at the lights. All of a sudden there were no more lights in the sky. We just went down the stairs, got into the car and drove home. Of course, we talked about the lights on the way home, and speculated about what it could have been, but it wasn't until I started hearing about reports of lights in the sky in Phoenix, and the documentary about UFO's on the Discovery Channel that I'm watching right now, that I felt compelled to report the incident.

New Years Amber light formation San Diego.;2008-01-01 01:45:00;5 minutes;New Years Amber light formation San Diego. It was early New Years morning and I fell asleep around 10pm on New Year's Eve I was home alone my wife was working at la Jolla shores bath and tennis club.  She called and woke me up around 01:15 New Years morning and asked to be picked up in 30 minutes.  I walked out of my apartment at 2636 grand avenue in San Diego. I walked down the walkway to my car parked on the north side of the building.  On my way to the car I looked up and noticed several Amber lights moving slowly over the la Jolla hills to the north. I thought it strange, but San Diego being a big military city I figured that it was helicopters or some military aircraft. I got in my jeep with the top down and headed north on the I 5 from pacific beach and noticed the lights again as I approached the la Jolla parkway exit and noticed there were 7 or 8 Amber lights at what seemed like an altitude of about 1000 feet above the hill moving extremely slowly from east to west in a sloppy triangle formation! with the rear light occasionally leapfrogging to the front of the formation. It seemed the lights were slightly ahead of me as I proceeded onto la Jolla parkway towards the north west and when I got to the top of the hill and stopped at the traffic light at the intersection of la Jolla parkway and la Jolla shores drive the lights appeared to stay stationary directly above me at an estimated altitude of 1000-2000 feet.  I did not hear any noise other than traffic whatsoever. At this point I concluded if they were helicopters I would surely be hearing them.  I turned north on la Jolla shores drive and proceeded Approximately 1/2 mile to the bath and tennis club and my wife was waiting curbside and got in the jeep. I turned around to a south heading and told my wife about the lights and pointed them out to her. She thought them strange as well. At that time they seemed about 1/2 mile to the west and picking up steady speed. By the time I got back to the traffic light 1/2 mile! south at la Jolla shores drive and la Jolla parkway the light! s seemed at least 5 miles out to sea already and continuing west/northwest. I turned to head east and lost sight of the lights by the time I reached my apartment again about 4-5 minutes later I could not find the lights again;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Motionless Red and Orange Flickering Light in the sky that appeared and slowly faded away (No Movement);2008-12-07 20:55:00;2 minutes;Motionless Red and Orange Flickering Light in the sky that appeared and slowly faded away (No Movement) I was sitting inside my room upstairs on MCAS Miramar base housing.  My bedroom window was open and I happened to glance outside and when I did I noticed a bright flickering red and and orange light outside in the night time sky.  It caught my attention and I immediatly told my 8 year old son who was in bed with me to look outside the window.  He saw it and said it looked like a blowing up star but I tried to tell him that it was not a star.   I went outside on my balcony and watched the mysterious light.  It was flickering red and orange and I noticed a moving aircraft near it, possibly a helicopter or small jet.  What really caught my attention was the fact that the object I was looking at did not move at all.  If it was a aircraft, it would have moved either to the right or left or something but this light was just in the sky with no movement.  I watched it for about 1 minute outside and then it just faded away!!  The object was north of the base and looked close to the coast if I had to estimate its location.  It was close enough that I could see the two distinct colors of red and orange but far enough away that I could not see any type of shape to the object except that it reminded me of a planet or something like that.   I dont know how long it had been in the sky, like I said I happened to glance out my window and when I noticed it something felt differant about it so I had to take a closer look and I did and it faded away......;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

I told my wife after watching the ball drop on t.v., lets see if the ufo is back.  Sure enough, we went out on our deck and as clear as the stars, we saw it again.  It was very high in the sky almost straight up.  It was a bright red cluster/round light.  Near the end of the sighting it flickered, faded out and disappeared.  It simply turns off.  Since it seems to reoccur on New Years, I wonder if it was a satellite.  However, it is so bright, it didn't move and just disappearing in thin air rules out sat, jet, plane or balloon.  Pretty trippy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

No object seen-just lights Heading west bound on Hwy 52 towards home-looked up in the sky as I always do, as it is a beautiful clear San Diego evening with lots of stars, then to the south I saw a bunch of lights-dark orange-Not blinking, very odd color. Some were bigger and brighter than others. I put my hazards on and slowed to about 25 mph completely blown away by what I was seeing and trying to come up with a logical explanation. I thought for a minute maybe something had exploded in the sky and i was seeing the embers, then  (There was an airplane heading south that was much lower but had to have seen the same thing I was seeing-probably either just departed or preparing to land at Montgomery Field.)  I pulled off Regents Rd and stopped the car-almost shaking as I watched each light slowly fade away.  I am a native San Diegan and have seen a few odd things in the sky but this is by absolute far the craziest thing I have ever seen in my entire life.  I called Highway Patrol about ten mins after the sighting to see if anyone had reported seeing anything crazy in the sky tonight and they had not received any other calls yet.  I am usually skeptical as most things can easily be explained but tonight I am still really freaked out and I cannot possibly be the only person that saw this tonight.  It was too many lights and encompassed too big of an area............?????;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Extreemly bright UFO orb over San Diego for over an hour, 8:00pm, February 12, 2009.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2009-02-12 20:00:00;1 hour;Extreemly bright UFO orb over San Diego for over an hour, 8:00pm, February 12, 2009. My fiance and myself stood on the sand at Ocean Beach last night (February 12, 2009) for over and hour watching a large glowing orb (UFO) in the sky over the ocean. I watch the planes come and go out of San Diego almost every night and this extremely bright orb got my attention immediately. This isn't the first time I've seen something like this, but this was the closest one. It was extremely bright. So bright that I couldn't make out any detail and it looked kind of fuzzy with bright short streaks surrounding it.  I first noticed it around 8pm or so, and watched it for over an hour come a bit closer, go out, move a bit up and down, horizontally, and in seemingly random directions. It would slowly go very dim, then extremely bright. This was in our atmosphere and not out in space. When a cloud would cover the UFO, the cloud appeared to be glowing from within, then the light would turn into a very dim pinpoint. When the fast moving cloud would move, it seemed the orb knew and would quickly turn bright again, just after the cloud had gone.  I heard a military helicopter (and living in SD, I know what one sounds like) going toward the orb, then what sounded like a military fighter jet. The helicopter seemed to have turned its lights off when it got close the the orb, but I could still hear that it was there circling around. The jet seemed to have no lights on the entire time. I watched for as long as I could, but I was cold and went to my car.  I would look at it once in a while to see if it was still there at it would have moved its position a little. Eventually it had disappeared. I did not see how it took off or if the light just went out. This orb was near the flight path of outgoing planes. I know they must have seen it.

Ball of moving light over North County, San Diego;2009-09-23 21:00:00;2 Hours;Ball of moving light over North County, San Diego In North County, San Diego: Vista, Oceanside, Camp Pendleton area there was a light that was brighter than anything else in the sky and was flashing/twinkling bright red, blue and white colors.  The colors were  crisp and bright, had a gem like sparkle, the red looking like a ruby. They flashed in different areas looking as though they were moving around a shape.  But at this point it sat so still, we continued to believe it was a heavenly body of some sort. But the lights looked so conspicuously different than anything else, we continued to observe it carefully.  At first it moved about the speed of a bright planet setting on the horizon.  Then it seemed to set  fast but had moved slightly south.  We lost sight of it and it looked like it was gone so we ignored it for about 10 minutes. Suddenly, it was there again sitting in the sky higher up than when we last saw it and much further to the south, more in front of us. It started to move north at an upward angle for a short distance.  Then floated in a straight line down towards Earth.  Then upwards again ending with a slight but definitely perceptible fast, zig zag pattern.  It's hard to describe it's ability to change it's movements – it drifted, floated, cruised and had the fast zig zag motion. Losing altitude it moved south at an angle, the lights stopped flashing, it took on a pod appearance and drifted south in a straight line and we lost sight of it. Shortly after wards, the sky appeared active with military aircraft. Did anyone else see this? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I have held a steady job for the last 5 years.  I am a veteran and believe in numbers and facts only.  On this night, I went outside for a cigarette like I normally do.  Occasionally I will pull out my phone and use my google sky map application to observe the night sky.  I looked up to the stars while the app was loading and noticed a star slowly moving south.  Keep in mind a couple things, i live about 10 mins. from the U.S./Mexico border, and the flight paths run east/west over my home.  As I was looking at the light I was wondering what plane could get to that altitude.  I was trying to distinguish the navigation lights, but didn't see any.  The light then made a sharp 90 degree turn towards the east, sped up by an astonishing amount before disappearing. The whole thing lasted about 3 mins.  One thing of great importance, when the light turned, it traveled between half and 3/4 of the dista ce it had already traveled in about a second before it faded and disappeared.  It was a clear sky where i was with no clouds. It disappeared into nothing.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Fast moving orange light over San Diego.;2011-10-06 22:05:00;2 seconds;Fast moving orange light over San Diego. Extremely fast light flying just over the lowest rain clouds sometime between 10:05 and 10:10 pm, Thursday October 6 in San Diego, California.  This light was traveling from south to north.  The light was not white.  It was very bright, somewhere between the colors orange and red.  It was larger than any star in the sky maybe 3 times the size of the largest star you see.  Of course it could be a meteor but I do not think so.  It did not look like any meteor I have ever seen.  I have seen a lot of meteor showers.  It seemed like it was flying level and just over the lowest cloud layer.  No sound. There is not much to this sighting.  It only lasted a couple of seconds.  If you extend your arms at full length, just over one and a half feet apart----the light traveled that much space in the sky in less than 2 seconds.  If you consider straight up as 90 degrees, then the light was traveling at about 70 degrees south to north.  I was standing near the corner of Washington Street and Front Street here in San Diego.  Front Street runs north and south, so I knew the direction the light traveled. I did not have my watch with me to get the exact time, but the sighting was between 10:05 and 10:10 pm, Thursday October 6. It had rained earlier in the day so there were patches of clear sky and low patches of rain clouds.   The light was not seen further north because the clouds blocked the view further north. This area has a lot of jet traffic for the San Diego airport.  This light was traveling at least 5 times faster than any jets in this area.   And again, no sound and the light was nothing like a meteor in my opinion.  The light seemed self contained and traveling flat just over the lowest clouds.

Dancing lights that would fly around and then merge into one light;2012-06-16 23:00:00;10 minutes;Dancing lights that would fly around and then merge into one light We went to Morely Field in Balboa Park in San Diego to walk our dog at night between 10:30 and 11:00 pm. There are very few people in the park at that time because they close the parking lot and you need to park on a side street and walk into the park.  It was a cool damp misty sort of night with clouds and lots of layers of atmosphere.  We saw these dancing lights in the sky and at first tried to explain it--maybe strobe lights or reflections of some kind but nothing made sense.  The lights would start from one source, then spread out and dance around and then return to the source light. The whole sky had a different quality to it, almost like a magnetic type of storm.  This went on for 5-10 minutes, then the lights returned to their source point. I could still see where they were, it was a slight glow in the clouds, but they stayed there and stopped dancing. I had the feeling it knew we were watching.  The source light was still there when we left the park.  We ! have been back to the park several times since, but have not encountered those conditions or seen the lights again.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Yellow-orange light seen 30 seconds and then it powered down and disappeared completly and then powered back on.;2012-08-27 20:25:00;15 minutes;Yellow-orange light seen 30 seconds and then it powered down and disappeared completly and then powered back on. Last night, Monday August 27 at 8:25 pm I had a sighting here in San Diego, California.  I was about 2 miles southeast of the intersection of Interstate freeways 5 and 8.  This sighting started out with a solid yellow-orange light coming towards me from the north towards the south.  I was looking north.  There were no collision lights like a normal plane or jet would have.  Many jets and planes are seen down here as this area is along the landing path for the San Diego airport.  Jets that are flying south will head south along the 5 freeway and then turn east over the 8 freeway in preparation of landing at the San Diego airport.  I am very familiar with seeing these jets and planes.  And these aircraft have collision lights, and in this sighting, there were no collision lights on this yellow-orange light.  Anyway, this yellow-orange light was moving slowing towards me.  It was almost as large as the front light seen on an approaching jet, which is larger tha! n a star in the sky.  After viewing this Yellow-orange light for about 30 seconds, it slowing turned off.  Nothing.  I kept watching the area where the light had disappeared and about 2 minutes later, but much higher in the sky, the light, or a light, powered back on and quickly flew west to east.  This time, the light was mostly white, but looked a duller color than the stars.  It was not moving slowly, but faster than a jet would move at that higher elevation.  I lost track of it after about 30 seconds as it was too far away.  Then about 15 to 20 minutes later, maybe about 8:45pm, I saw a white light power-up directly north of me again but this time lower than the first 2 lights described above.  This last time the light was as low as the jets coming in for their landing descent.  The light was not directly in the jets path, but somewhat more north.  It was slowing moving south to north and slow.  I did not see this last light very long, maybe 15 seconds and then it slow! ly turned off or powered down.  I say powered down, because th! at's the impression I got when I saw it turn off.  Again, no collision lights.  It was just gone.  I don't know if this was 1 craft or 2 or 3 separate crafts.  I did not hear any noise.  I should have heard something, at least for the last light since it was closer, but I did not.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Four amber colored lights moved from north to south, about 30 degrees off the horizon, along the eastern end of Balboa Park, near the golf driving range.   We observed these lights for approximately a minute and a half. They appeared to increase in altitude, have a slight flicker and then either they went out or went behind a cloud.

Three bright lights moving in unison then splitting up dramatically, later regrouping... power outage 4 hours later.;2013-11-22 16:08:00;7 minutes;Three bright lights moving in unison then splitting up dramatically, later regrouping... power outage 4 hours later I am a researcher at one of San Diego's largest employers and I can say without a doubt that these objects had the ability to move beyond the gravitational forces that a human can experience without dying in a conventional gravitational field. Three objects moved across the eastern san diego sky right at the cloud line in very mild San Diego thunderstorm conditions.    At first the group of three moved in unison circling around in the clouds almost looking as if it was a very very low flying plane with one white light on the nose, and one on each wing.   I have seen large low flying planes circling exactly in the same manner at the Miramar air show and there is a considerable amount of noise when this happens.  These objects made no sound at all and after circling around several times within the clouds came out of the clouds and set still for a moment.   They then dramatically split/jumped into different directions in a manner impossible with airfoil lifted craft.  One headed north, the other went to the south. After 5 minutes they were gone, then we spotted them in unison again 3minutes later, now flying much closer to the horizon at a high rate of speed about the same as a fighter jet with the throttle pumping, along with the very loud noise that a fighter jet makes.  These objects again had no sound.  After another minute they were gone. I was trying to catch video of the three together but by accident only took a still shot and two of them are very clear in the picture.  It seemed that they were responsive to my actions because everytime I tried to get video they split up into singles or were out view which doesn't look nearly as compelling. 4 hours our area experienced a power outage affecting over 1200 homes in my area.  Power was restored the following morning.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

The passes were at 9:20, 9:40 & 10:01 pm.  Unusual for a fighter jet to be running exercises over a suburban area that late at night. Yellow-white light descended down directly over my apartment just before 10pm.  Apartment buildings surrounding mine were illuminated by light.  It pulsed bright white light in horizontal plane a few times like ripples on water.  Jet approached from west heading in easterly direction.   Both jet and light were at approximately same altitude.  Estimate between 100-150 feet above ground level.  As jet closed on light' it was accelerating.  Light sped away in easterly direction at fantastic speed as jet was nearly over block.   Building shook & windows rattled so violently I thought I might get showered with shattered glass.  Jet seemed to be pursuing light.  It never made a sound.  F/A-18 was loud and scary low. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Sorry, date must have gotten dropped. 04/24/2014 was date.  Quiet night except for traffic.  I can hear passing cars and buses.  If people are walking nearby, I can hear them.  There was no discernable sound from light. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2)) Observed light for about a minute before jet approached.

Ball/orb of light dripping liquid fire pulses and then streaks of into night sky;2014-05-13 23:00:00;10-12 seconds;Ball/orb of light dripping &quotliquid fire&quot pulses and then streaks of into night sky While walking my dog as I do almost every night I witnessed an unexplainable, for me anyway, event in the sky. It was what some might call a fire ball or orb of light, but there was something else going on as well. Before I continue let me say that I live near a military air station, as well as a smaller but busy local airport. I am accustomed to seeing all manner of aircraft, both at night and during the day, such as Osprey (with the rotors up like a helicopter), giant military transport planes, light/personal aircraft, small personal jets, fighter planes, and helicopters of all kinds.  I know very little about aviation but this was nothing I had ever seen before. This event happened in the eastern sky, and appeared to be fairly close.  It lasted about 10-12 seconds total, but was already happening when I looked up.  At first I thought what I was seeing was a meteor falling and burning up very close to the ground.  There seemed to be debris falling and burning up in the sky like something breaking up. However, after maybe half a second or so, I noticed two things.  1) It was not falling but stationary.  2) The brightest point of light was at the top.  At that point I thought maybe a firework. The debris, for lack of a better word, was almost “dripping” from the ball/orb of light.  It seemed to have a liquid quality to it.  Not at all like what you would associate with a firework.  It almost looked like burning/melting plastic being poured or dripping/falling into the night sky. I then thought maybe it was a lantern burning up and the dripping was just thin paper on fire and swirling around, and the ball/orb of light was the heat source for the lantern.  But the ball of light remained stationary and the “liquid fire” kept falling so much that it would be hard to believe this was all paper from a lantern or that the lantern would even be able to maintain its elevation while loosing that much of its structure.  The same would go for any aircraft. It was just so much fire.  It also did not seem to be consistent with what I have witnessed as a flare. At this point it has been maybe 3-3.5 seconds.  The origin of the “liquid fire” began to glow very bright and appeared to grow larger.  It also, at this point, started to pulse alternating between a dimmer light red-orange color and a full, bright true-orange color.  The “liquid fire” increased in volume and also seemed to pulse along with the ball/orb of light. It stayed this way, very bright, for a couple of 2-3 seconds and then the dripping “liquid fire” stopped.  The ball/orb grew even brighter and more well defined. It pulsed a couple more times finally sticking with the red-orange color, and shot off heading east at a very high rate of speed.  I could see it for 3-4 seconds before it was too small to be visible anymore. There was no sound that I would say could be attributed to this event.  This is in a suburban area and near a highway so there is ambient noise.  However, it is also in a valley and air traffic is usually amplified not muffled or masked.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

My friend and I were at my home in a secluded area of the mountains, east of San Diego.  We were studying the night sky and then looked down as we walked the horses through the pasture gate.   Suddenly we were enveloped within a brilliant white light, which included an area approximately 30 feet long by 20 feet wide.   My first thought was lightening had struck, but quickly remembered the sky was clear.   My friend looked up at the sky and saw nothing, although she thought she might have seen a smoke trail.   We did not hear any noise nor did the horses and dogs respond to the light.   The entire episode only lasted a couple of seconds.

Neon blue light with a smaller reddish part moving faster than the incoming jets and making erratic turns.;2014-11-30 20:20:00;45 seconds;Neon blue light with a smaller reddish part moving faster than the incoming jets and making erratic turns About an hour and a half ago, at 8:20pm (give or take a couple of minutes), I was standing outside in the Mission Hills Mini Park.  I was looking NNW, when a neon blue light came into my field of vision.  Again, it was mostly a neon blue, but there was a much smaller red light glow or light too.  The red light was about one quarter the size as the neon blue or smaller.  The light was as large and as bright as the landing light of an incoming jet preparing to land at the San Diego airport.  The light did not blink off and on as the anti-collision lights do.  It was a steady light.   Anyway, this light was moving very fast from the east to the west when it came into my field of vision.  Within 3 seconds it was NW of me and made a 180 degree turn.  It came back east a little and then went almost straight down but at a slight angle.   It disappeared for 20 seconds or so behind the tree line across the canyon and then came back up for 10 seconds.  It moved in a swimming motion in different directions.  Then down again below the tree line almost straight down, but again at a slight angle.  This was not a long way away from me it was close.  The light was closer than the planes coming south towards the San Diego airport.  When the planes are preparing to land, they get close to the airport and turn or head east along the Interstate 8 freeway corridor before turning back to the San Diego airport.   So, this light was moving much faster than the planes preparing for their approach to the airport and of course was closer to me than the Planes heading east along the Interstate corridor.  This light was also lower than the incoming jets and planes at all times in this sighting and must have come down close to the ground in order for me to loose sight of it, twice, behind the tree line across Dove Canyon (western finger of Dove Canyon).   This light moved gracefully, but not in straight lines.  It moved slightly erratically, a little like a d! olphin swimming rather than straight lines.  When it made a 180 degree turn, it was almost instantaneously.  This obviously was not a plane or helicopter.  If it was a drone, it would have to have been a jet powered drone, but that is not possible either, since there was no sound.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Second craft by the International Space Station as it passed by San Diego, California, 18 June, 2015.;2015-06-18 22:36:00;30 seconds;Second craft by the International Space Station as it passed by San Diego, California 18 June 2015 I was standing in the West Lewis Mini Park in Mission Hills, which is part of San Diego.   At 10:33pm I saw a faint satellite coming from the NW and heading SE.  Since most satellites I see usually are flying either N-S, S-N, E-W or W-E I guessed it was probably the International Space Station.   As it got closer to being almost directly overhead, I noticed there was not just one light, but a second light traveling the same path and speed.  The second light was the leading light and was dimmer.  At an arm's length, the 2 lights were only the width of my thumb apart.   I checked the time when I saw the 2 lights.  It was 10:33pm.  I went inside and checked the ISS TRACKER web page, and sure enough, the space station had passed by San Diego at that time.   I have seen the space station pass overhead several times, but this was the first time I saw another craft by the space station.   I checked the NASA web page, and there was a Russian space craft docked with the space station earlier in the day.  In fact, they had a planned and successful space burn earlier in the day to change the space station orbit.  The article I saw did not mention if the Russian space craft that was docked at the space station was planned to undock yesterday.   Maybe someone else can figure out when or if the Russian space craft left the space station before my sighting.   Anyway, I have pasted part of the NASA article that was posted on June 18.  The International Space Station got an orbital boost this morning after a docked Russian re-supply craft fired its engines for four minutes and eight seconds.  One more re-boost is scheduled for July 10, when the station will be at the proper altitude for a new Soyuz crew to dock at the end of July.  The crew onboard the orbital laboratory conducted a wide array of experiments today looking at such things as radiation, liquid crystals and life science.   The trio of station residents also continued more eye checks with assistance from specialists on the ground.  One-Year crew member Mikhail Kornienko participated in the Matroyshka and RADI-N studies monitoring space radiation and exploring how it affects station crew members. 6055 : 08 : 39 : 00 Station Time in Orbit  Benefits to You NASA Astronauts Headline Public Events in Washington Area.

PD)) I am a delivery driver  50 years old, and on Saturday night I was traveling west on robinson ave. and at about tenth st. I noticed an orange-ish golden light moving from my left to right.  I at first thought it was a helicopter but noticed it was way out there - higher than a plane would fly.  Then quite quickly the light flashed brighter like an explosion, and then I could see a trail of debris or sparks spread out behind the light.  If the light was half an inch wide in the sky the debris field was 4 inches about.  I was pointing to other drivers saying are you seeing this?, and then the light changed colors to white/blue-ish and started to travel towards me.  The light then expanded in a concentric circle from the center like when you see a plane hit mach speed, - so the center light is there with this ring around expanding slowly, and this starts to fade.  Now it looks like the light went to the right and back again, but in hind sight the lig! ht may have been spinning and appeared to be moving left to right.  The whole light seemed to fade then into a cloud that was square/rectangular in shape.  This cloud then turned green, and stayed that way for at least 5 minutes, then the whole cloud faded out.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

PD)) At approximately 6:03pm I received a call from my friend who was delivering a pizza in the Mira Mesa area, where I live. He told me that there was a bright greenish/blue spot in the sky and it was unlike any atmospheric anomaly he had ever witnessed in San Diego. 	I walked out front of my house and looked around, and spotted it immediately as it was VERY vivid. The sky was pretty clear that night so it looked like an oval indigo cloud just hanging in the middle of the atmosphere west of my position, presumably over Sorrento valley or maybe La Jolla. I confirmed on the phone that I saw it too and walked into the street a bit to get a better view. 	I spotted a formation below and to the right of the cloud, not moving in the sky. It was far away and hard to see unless I looked at in my peripherals, but I could define at least one white/red pinpoint light and what appeared to be another but was too dim and too far to visibly distinguish. There could have been a cluster of them but I couldn't get my telescope out in time to see. In between the formation was a faint stream of light running vertically, looking like a stream of glowing fog. The formation would become brighter and dimmer periodically, staying in the same spot. 	Over time the blue light cloud got harder and harder to see, and the formation below began to tilt clockwise, about 30-45 degrees before I lost track of it. I observed the two from the roof of my house until they slowly faded away and eventually disappeared.  I can't be certain of it but I believe the source of the blue glow was the formation I saw below, or it was possibly projected from the ground at Miramar MCAS nearby.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

I was sitting on my front porch when I witnessed two objects flying from south to north at an apparent high rate of speed at about 50-5;2016-01-05 21:18:00;5-10 seconds;I was sitting on my front porch, when I witnessed two objects flying from south to north at an apparent high rate of speed, at about 50-55 degrees in the western sky.  There was absolutely no sound and they appeared as perhaps the brightness of an average star with a fuzzy-red quality to them.   Earth-bound aircraft must have strobe lights.  These had none.  One sped into view going in a straight line and, within one second, another followed even faster, catching up to the first one.  They then diverged from one another, making several immediate and instantaneous sharp angle turns.  This is something our aircraft cannot even come close to achieving.  It was as if they were doing aerial maneuvers in a somewhat playful way.  At one point it appeared like they might run into each other.   I cannot tell how fast they were moving because I do not know how far away they were.  One is a function of the other.  My best educated guess would be they were one mile away which would put their speed at something like 600 mph.  I base this on seeing airplanes flying at a given pace at 30,000 feet knowing they are moving at 500-600 mph.  However, they could have been 20 miles away putting their speed 20 times faster, or 12000 mph. Both scenarios are equally plausible.   The whole viewing lasted maybe 5-10 seconds and it was frustrating that I couldn't see it over and over again in a rewind/play/rewind fashion.  It leaves more questions than answers....Could these have been drones?  That thought entered my head but I've seen drone flight aerodynamic characteristics on line and there is no way they come close to what I saw....I was just lucky enough to have been looking at the right section of the sky at precisely the right moment.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

An orange light moved into the glow of the moon and came back out, brighter, shooting diagonally down.;2016-10-11 19:25:00;60 seconds;An orange light moved into the glow of the moon and came back out, brighter, shooting diagonally down and in a slightly reversed motion. While looking at stars with my dad, we saw what we thought was a satellite crossing the sky, from west to east.  It appeared slightly orange, about the same brightness and color as Mars.  It was travelling at a speed similar to a satellite--but a little faster.  It moved east, getting closer toward the moon, until it was lost in its glow.  It was just above the moon when it disappeared in the glow.  We expected it to emerge from the glow on the other side but, when it came out of the glow, it suddenly got brighter and at about the speed of a meteor, dropped down diagonally, angled backwards to the west (like a backwards 7)  and then suddenly disappeared.  The distance it dropped was about the length of a finger held at arm's length.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Triangle Pattern Of Lights Off San Diego Coastline;2017-03-15 20:50:00;10 minutes;Triangle Pattern Of Lights Off San Diego Coastline From the beach in Oceanside, CA, 25 miles north of Mt Soledad (La Jolla), I observed the formation of lights described by the pilot in the other report.   I was driving down Pacific Coast Highway, when I noticed the triangle pattern of 3 extremely bright yellow orange lights.  I drove to a beach parking lot adjacent to Wisconsin Street in Oceanside to get a clear view over the ocean of the lights.  Other people there at the beach were observing the lights as well and remarking that they seemed strange.  The lights appeared to be 5  to 10 miles off the San Diego coast over the ocean due West of La Jolla.  The lowest light of the triangle pattern may have been 5,000 to 7,500 feet in altitude.  The 2 upper lights of the triangle formation were not level, and may have been in the 10,000 to 12,500 altitude range.  The triangle was large and the lights were much brighter in intensity than any aircraft landing lights would have been at that distance.  I tried to t! ake a picture with my cel phone camera but the images did not register.  All of us present observed the light pattern for about 10 minutes, then one seemed to turn off.   I drove off, continuing Southward on Pacific Coast Highway towards home, and when I looked about 10 minutes later the lights were gone.  My thought was the lights may have been some type of signal flares and perhaps the Navy was conducting some sort of training or practice exercise off of the San Diego coast.  I have seen signal flares in the night sky at Camp Pendelton and they slowly descend and weaken as they drop.  These lights did not descend and were at least 10x's brighter or more than any signal flare I've seen.  I've done a couple of Google searches and couldn't find any mention or explanation.   When I came across the other report from the pilot on Mt Soledad, I realized we had observed the same lights, and decided to file this report.  I do not believe earth has ever been visited by extraterrestrials, I believe there is a man made explanation of  these lights.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

My family and I had just landed in San Diego, California, for Christmas with my grandmother.  After landing at about 5:30 pm PST, we started driving north towards La Jolla and saw what looked like a plane’s smoke trail.  The smoke started expanding and had a luminescent glow to it.  That’s where two lights sources that appeared to be parts of the rocket.  But at about 1 minute and 52 seconds of the video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UaZFDmLbLE   two light anomalies occurred.  The first is a quick light that appears on the left side of the screen and the second is a bright light that travels from the left of the screen, first decelerating and then quickly accelerating and disappearing off the right hand of the screen.  Both my brother and I saw the light anomaly and you can hear our reaction upon seeing it.  The cars window, from which we were filming, was down.  This bright light went at a speed that cannot be seen on Earth.  This appearance is unexplainable and has left many people speechless and with doubts about what they saw.

5 orange lights moving slowly and then fizzling out;2018-02-17 18:40:00;3-4 minutes;5 orange lights moving slowly and then fizzling out My husband called me outside to ask what they were.  We saw 5 or 6 orange/reddish lights, like small flames moving slowly like a drone would.  They were moving in a southwesterly direction, and as they got into a line, they just fizzled out.  It was very strange.   I tried to capture pics on my phone, but they look white and are not very good shots.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
White object high over south end of USMC Mira Mar base(past Top Gun) heading South and West.;2019-02-24 11:05:00;5 minutes;White object high over south end of USMC Mira Mar base(past Top Gun) heading South and West. Looking from ground level, south, a large white object moving south and then curving west over and away from the area of USMC aircraft base Mira Mar.  Compared to the sun, very small point of bright white, a bit of a cigar shape, moving slowly.  When a black helicopter, no markings, no numbers passed by at approx 1000 ft. moving ese approx 100 mph.  As I scanned the area I saw a jet fighter contrail, could be F-14, F18 or 22, as we have Naval aviation here as well as USMC.  This fighter was approaching the area of the Mira Mar base, fast, approx 1,200 mph or more towards the area of this object on a ese heading, approx 10,000 ft or higher, it would be 5 minutes, as the object curved to the west approaching the Pacific ocean, then disappeared from view.  Thanks for taking my call.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Lights on Mount Helix.;2019-06-23 00:15:00;30 seconds;Lights on Mount Helix A row of very bright lights was spotted on the east side of Mt. Helix, just after midnight.  Five lights in a horizontal row, white, green, white, green, white.  I thought it was stadium lights, but far too bright and far too big. The lights appeared just above the east ridgeline of Mount Helix.  Lights remained for about 20 seconds.  After 15 seconds, another very bright set of lights, this time orange and white, appeared over the El Cajon valley to the east.  The new lights lasted about 5 seconds, then both sets of lights went dark.  Point of observation was near Cowles Mt. in San Carlos neighborhood.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Series of bright orange lights appearing above San Diego;2019-08-01 22:10:00;30 minutes;Series of bright orange lights appearing above San Diego Several bright lights above the horizon, right above the cloud layer, bright orange and shimmering.  First, there was one, which we thought might be a light.  Looking from the Poway area, it was Southwest and at the same star location as the Menkent star cluster. It faded away without moving after 5 minutes, but then reappeared in the same spot with a second light around a minute later.  These stuck around for another 5 minutes, or so, faded, and then reappeared with 3 lights, in the same spot. The three lights stayed for about 10 minutes.  During this time, they shimmered in different patterns, then faded away.  After less than a minute, one appeared above and to the right of the original location, stayed a minute, then faded, and soon after two appeared, below the previous but above the original location.  They faded as well, and that was it. There was a heavy Marine layer at the time, so no other stars were shining through, but these were abnormally bright, much brighter than the city lights in the distance though appearing to be just as far.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

I do not always see them, but they seem to be in all my pictures. I have pictures of the lights following me, which jump from frame to frame. I am unsure as to what these things are, but it scares me that they are always watching me.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Bright red light moving fast and high.;2021-01-11 20:55:00;1 minute;Bright red light moving fast and high. At approximately 20:55 on January 11th, 2021 I observed a bright, deep red light out of my living room bay windows facing south.  We can see the airliners as they begin their approach to  Lindbergh Field (SAN) out of these windows, and at night the bright white landing lights are had to miss.  I saw this deep red light moving much faster than the airliners normally do, and moving east to west, instead of south-north like the airliners. I pointed it out to my wife, and we watched it for about 15 seconds before it was blocked by my house. We went outside to the front yard and watched it for an additional 10-ish seconds. It seemed like is was high and moving very fast. We lost sight of it as it grew dimmer. The light was very bright, a deep red color overall, steady, no blinking or flashing. No additional lights were seen, (like anti-collision lights) It moved very quickly along a straight path.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
