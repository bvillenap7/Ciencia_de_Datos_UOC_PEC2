I saw an huge glowing UFO with my mother and neighbors hovering over our backyard when I was about 20, which moved at light speed.;1978-08-10 22:00:00;15min;I saw an huge glowing UFO with my mother and neighbors hovering over our backyard when I was about 20, which moved at light speed. The sky was clear. It was hot out and we had all the windows and drapes open. I was watching TV. My mom took the trash out by the front door and after a moment she came racing back through the house and out the back door, she didn't say anything to me at first and she didn't even shut the back sliding screen door. I was into my TV show and only just sort of noticed her odd behavior. After a moment, she began to call my name in a frantic tone of voice. I jumped up and ran to the back yard. I looked up where she was looking and couldn't help but see this huge, and I mean huge oval shaped thing that was just glowing with a yellow white light. It was right over our heads, but didn't light up the back yard or cast the light at all, even though it was like the brightest thing in the world. It made NO sound at all. My mom yelled for our neighbors, next door (their lights were also on). They came out and the four of us just kept looking at it, I don't remember us talking much at the time. After watching it a while, I could see that the glowing lights did seem like individual lights not just one huge light. It was bigger than a blimp size, more like 3 or 4 large blimps, but the wrong shape to be a blimp. The sky was very clear and there was no sound at all. Suddenly, it just took off toward the west, toward the beach area. It was as if one moment it was over our back yard and the next moment it was gone. We could see it go, but it left so fast, as fast as you could move your hand from in front of you to your side (holding your arm out straight).  I'm not sure of the date, but I was still living at home, so I had to be between 19 and 20, I married in Nov. of my 20th year. This was the third UFO I had seen. I think it was my Mom's first. I don't know about the neighbors.All three sightings were very different looking, however, all three were silent. This was by far the largest, the others were much smaller, and seen in the day too. This was the only one at night. After it left, I did call the newspaper, but they ! weren't interested, and didn't seem to know anything about it, no one else had called it in. I also called Miramar Air Base, and asked if they had anything that looked like this thing out flying that night. They acted like I was a nut. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My 2nd UFO sighting, October 1979;1979-10-10 22:00:00;3 minutes;My 2nd UFO sighting, October 1979 This is my second sighting, and I'm not exactly sure of the date, but I do remember it was the second Monday in October, the year 1979, around 10:00pm. I was visiting the home of a friend, about a mile from where I used to live-- my parents' house.  My friend and I were sitting on the driveway, leaning against the garage door talking, and I happened to look up at the sky, when something unusual caught my attention, and we're talking about WAY up in the sky. This huge, I mean really HUGE object was moving across the sky at a very slow speed.  The object was not only enormous in size, but it was white, very bright, and shaped like a dome.  It reminded me of the Captiol dome, yet lying on it's side, with this white foggy type of mist trailing out of it. My friend both sat quietly and stared at this object moving across the sky, and then it disappeared.  Afterward, my friend and I turned to one another in amazement and that was that. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We believe the second Monday in October 1979 may have been the 8th or 9th of October, but we will try to check.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

My son was out jogging about a block and a half from our home,and stopped in his tracks when saw something in the sky, . My son first said it was as large as a football field, but corrected this to saying it seemed large like a planet. He said the width covered the span of five to seven houses, which might not make sense, but this is what he said. My son stopped to look at it, and did a doubletake, because he could not believe what he was looking at. Afterwards, he ran home to tell me.  I walked to where the sighting took place(perhaps I should have taken my car)and unfortunately it was gone.  We just wanted to let you know. Thank You... The object was bright and yellow similar to the sun,with an oval shape.  It was described as having clouds all around it, but I assume this is due to probably actual clouds in the skyhowever,I must admit it is a clear night out. The object was low in the western sky and  covered the span of five to seven houses. My son said looked like a planet. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicated the date of 11NO00.

A ballon-like small derigible looking object moved in a straight path, unaffected by wind currents, at a constant speed of about 5 mph;2000-09-18 18:30:00;10 minutes;A ballon-like small derigible looking object moved in a straight path, unaffected by wind currents, at a constant speed of about 5 mph Observer #1 is female, 65 years old, white-caucasian, retired, married to Observer #2, male, 68 years old, white-caucasian, retired lawyer and law school professor, and amateur back-yard astronomer.  As the observers were eating dinner at their residence (elevation 650 ft. above sea level at approximately 33 degree North latitude, 117 degrees West longitude) located at the mouth of a canyon,  observer #1 spotted a balloon-like object in the sky about one-half mile due east across a small valley and above a ridge at an elevation of approximately 750 feet above sea level. This is in an neighborhood of widely spaced large homes on large (1 acre+) lots in an uneven terrain. The object moved slowly toward the observers'  home until about 1/4 mile away, when it  made a right angle turn to the north, at which time observer #2 saw it. The object, which was gray colored,  did not behave as a typical balloon. It  seemed to have a controlled flight path and a constant speed (perhaps 5 miles per hour), and it maintained a level elevation of about 750 feet.  It did not drift in  the breeze, nor change elevation, but moved slowly in a straight path. The observers moved outdoors onto the patio behind their residence, and observer #2 observed it thereafter through 7 x 35 binoculars.  After making a 90 degree turn to the north, it travelled slowly (estimated at 5 mph) due north across Lake Hodges and toward the City of Escondido, CA, in a straight line until it disappeared in the distance.  At one point, over Lake Hodges, the left (western) side of the object glinted in the setting sunlight. The oject had a shape somewhat between that of a balloon and a football.  It had no wings, or anything exterior to its basic shape,  and no antennae were observed.  It was about as large as a standard sized suitcase, about 3 feet long and 1.5 feet wide, and an elyptical shape, somewhat like a small derigible. No sound or light  was emitted from the object.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Myself, my Wife as well as my big sister came along also. I am an avid astronomy buff & had set my Meade Telescope for a view of Mars, as it is so close and a clear night would benefit viewing, along with the altitude.  We noticed a laser shooting into the sky, apparently coming from atop one of the radar towers which we as kids used to call big golf balls as they used to look like when they were covered with the white circular enclosures.  After a few minuted the laser stopped and about a half mile behind it, (facing the western sky) a fuzzy red kind of smeared oval just dropped out of the sky approx. 1000 feet high, and slowly moved to the east at a five degree angle, horizontally. And then just stopped and faded away.  With my years of sky watching I am sure this was not a meteor, jet, copter or exhaust from a airplane.  This moved with intelligence.  All of us spotted it and found it unusual that this device would be in such a close proximity to the laser signal. Which is obviously what it is and what it was doing at that specific time, with this UFO device so close to it.  This report is FACT as I am a natural born American and hold true to respect and serve the Red, White and Blue.  GOD BLESS AMERICA!;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

To Whom It May Concern, A friend and I were driving towards the beach in San Diego on Friday the 11th of July, 2014. I was driving over a bridge when I saw something strange in the sky about 1 to 2 miles away towards the beach.  I looked at it for about 30 seconds, while trying to show my friend what I was looking at.  He couldn't see what I was seeing:  a round orb flouting in the sky.  It wasn't anything recognizable, i.e. plane, helicopter or drone. I told my friend to take some pictures with his I-phone but he couldn't see what I was talking about so I told him to steer the car while I took the pictures.  I was able to get two pictures through my windshield and one with the window on the driver's side rolled down. There wasn't a place to pull over and when I finally could pull over the object had disappeared.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Red orb slowly maneuvers and changes color, shape, and direction in the southwest San Diego Sky.;2015-10-31 23:45:00;2 minutes;Red Orb slowly maneuvers and changes color, shape, and direction in the Southwest San Diego Sky. At first I noticed a red orb hanging in the southwest sky. I thought it was venus at first, but it was a bright red and it was moving.  It seemed so far away, yet close at the same time.  The orb moved downwards in a line perpendicular to the horizon, and it seemed to get brighter as it fell closer.   At first it moved in a linear fashion, so I thought it was a shooting star or that Halloween asteroid, but it was moving too slowly and seemed too close to be a celestial object.   After about a minute watching the red orb, it changed color to a pale grey and was difficult to see in the night sky.  The shape of the orb seemed more disk like at this point and it changed direction from south to west - a maneuver that both my friend and I had not seen any planes or helicopters do.  The dim, grey disk moved slowly and we thought we had lost sight of it, but it was distinct and clearly not something we were used to seeing move in the night sky.  It changed direction from west to south again, but appeared to move away from us instead of closer as it had when it was bright red... and then we lost sight of it.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

They were flying at an approximate elevation of 3,500 ft. (I used the approximate elevation of the nearby mountain they passed by to get the altitude)  The objects were flying in a partially cloudy sky and passed over the San Ysidro Mountain but not above it. I was looking South East when I first spotted them across Tijuana.  Then I looked east when they were the closest to my location (point of reference).  These objects were not in a linear position, they were scattered at different altitudes and some closer together and other further apart.  The objects kept flying north until I lost visibility of them. In order to see the flying objects I had to focus my vision into the sky and stare at it until I was able to spot them.  They moved at a steady pace not too fast but not slow either. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

It was a clear night.  A single bright light, larger than any of the stars, was moving from the Southwest to the Northeast.  There were no blinking anti-collision lights.  There was no sound coming from it that I could hear even though it seemed to be flying very low.  It came almost directly over me.   As it passed over me, I was standing on the sidewalk in front of a 2-story building.  I moved a little into the street to see it continuing towards the Northeast and then it completely disappeared in about 2 seconds.  It slowing faded out.  I continued to look for another minute, but it never reappeared.  A police helicopter happened to be flying from the east towards me about 20 seconds later.  I mention that only because the helicopter appeared just a little lower than the earlier light by comparison.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Oval white UFO traveling fast overhead toward approaching aircraft at estimated max speed of 2,898 m/h.  ((MUFON report));2020-06-09 18:05:00;3.5 seconds;Oval white UFO traveling fast overhead toward approaching aircraft at estimated max speed of 2,898 m/h. This is a repeat listing of MUFON case number 109367 filed same day as sighting. I was able to make estimates of altitude and speed shortly after I filed the MUFON report but am unable to update that report, so I will include those estimations here. Observer is a retired aerospace engineer with a structural test, design and analysis background. Wife and I sitting on outside patio 6:05 pm on cloudless warm summer evening. Heard popping sounds we never heard before coming from trees. I got up to look at the pine tree in our back yard because the patio umbrella obscured my view. I also looked directly overhead at palm tree canopy. My wife heard the popping but remained seated under the umbrella. Later found out noise was the sound of the pine cones opening. One UFO emerged from behind palm tree canopy straight overhead going fast and about the size of ½ a pencil eraser held at arms length. Within .5 to 1.0 second I ruled out it being a bird or a plane due to straight flight path, speed, no sound, it’s oval shape and fuzzy (no hard edge) appearance. I was able to see it for a total of about 3.5 seconds when I lost track of it in the whiteness of the horizon. It was also white with luminosity similar to that of a white fluffy cloud. SPEED / ALTITUDE / SIZE ESTIMATES: We live under Lindbergh field approach path and aircraft are approximately at 1000 ft. elevation near this sighting. The UFO was headed into the approach path of the aircraft. It was 2 to 4 times the height of typical approaching aircraft. Observed at 90 degree elevation and lost sight at 15 degree elevation (measured) making for a 75 degree angle of observation. Using this geometry the speed calculation comes out to be 2,898 m/h if at 4000 foot elevation or 1,447 m/h if at 2000 ft. elevation, again, no sonic boom or sound was heard. Diameter estimates range from 15 to 30 foot in diameter depending on actual altitude.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
