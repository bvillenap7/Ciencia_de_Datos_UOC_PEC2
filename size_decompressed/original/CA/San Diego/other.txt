Well, I noticed a black tiny version of a plane.  Had wings just like a jet real high but quiet and didn't leave that trail of smoke at all.  The sky was clear and I watched this plane go through a tiny cloud and disappear!  Seconds later a tiny green light came out of the cloud and flew the other way slowly then disappeared.  This was unbelievable because the clouds were tiny patches and the rest of the sky was clear.  There's No way that wasn't a ufo unless we have solid black jets that in a second can transform into some tiny green light craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

We first thought it was a helicopter, but it stayed in one spot. We watched it, and it seemed to be watching us. Someone knocked on our door,  I turned to door, turned back to object. Then it suddenly moved quickly to right, then sharply turned to left and disappeared out over ocean. It seems that SanDiego, and especially, Point Loma was very active at that time. Some of my tennants were walking the next evening, and said a bright light was following,and they said that they ran back to apartment , and it stopped at the door when they entered the building.  They did not know of our experience the afternoon before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Encounters, abductuin and informed of future changes coming and their reason for coming into my life and their response to changes.;1989-06-01 02:00:00;3 hours;encounters, abductuin and informed of future changes coming and their reason for coming into my life and their response to changes. I was taken from my bedroom by two tall beings that had human features and qualities. They took me aboard their craft gave me a tour of three floors explaining through mind non verbal communication what each are was for and their final discussion with me was events that were coming.  Showing me by a virtual reality show of their future response to events coming to our planet and our people.  I did not understand at that time that it was not coming then, I thought it was.  They did in no way harm me and in fact were very gentle, kind and loving, I was in no way afraid of them or ever felt threaten by them at all.  In fact I felt they were very much concerned for me and our planet.  They explained that they would be removing animals from our planet in order for life to continue. In 1974 I was  moving from PA. to CA. towing a trailer with the assistance of my brother I was 19 and he was 17 at that time.  Somewhere in the middle of farm country of OHIO at 3 am my brother was driving and I was awakened by his screaming my name.  The ford pinto I owned at the time was going on and off, all the lights engine and radio. Then all of a sudden it totally died.  Lights, radio engine completely shut down. We got a flashlight out of the glove box and got out lifted the hood to see what we could see, naive as  neither of us had a clue what we could do.  I suggested we get back in the car and what until morning and perhaps hitchhike to any near town as we were about 35 miles from any town.  So we just curled up to go to sleep and then there was a small red light that went flying over the nearby farm field in a flash. About 5 minutes later my car came back on radio, lights and engine started right back up.  Because everything had shut down we had not turned anything off so it just came right back on. From that day to the day I sold it I never had this ever occur again or any electrical problems. In 77 or 78 when Close Encounters of the Third Kind the movie came out my brother called me from calif to tell me to go see this movie without telling me why. And there in the movie was exactly what occurred to us.  I was never one who was someone who read any science fiction stories.  I may have been a Star Trek fan and I have always been a believer in all things are possible. But I was never one who was looking for these kind of encounters or interactions. I was recently living in Montana and had 4-5 encounters there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
like a large high-voltage tower on its side, with lights, moving slowly;1990-07-01 20:30:00;30 seconds;like a large high-voltage tower on its side, with lights, moving slowly I was driving down the 805 freeway heading north of San Diego on my way to Rancho Santa Fe.  It was a wqarm summer evening so I'd taken the top off my car.  I was with a friend and we were in heavy traffic that was moving slowly as we approached the 5N merge.   We both looked up and saw what looked like a huge high voltage tower on its side, moving very slowly, approximately twenty miles per hour through the sky toward the Calfornia coast.  It was several hundred feet above the freeway, but the sky was clear and we could see it plainly.   The object made absolutely no noise.  It moved from east of us to the west.  We looked to see if anyone else say what we saw.  The object was very long, at least 200 feet.  You could see sky through the object as you would see through a metal upright tower.  The object had several round lights around the body of the structure.   I did not report this to your office at the time because I didn't know of the existence of your service at the time.  However, I did call a radio station to see if anyone had reported the same siting.  The radio station said that no one had called and I did not give my name.   This sighting was the second time in my life I had seen a UFO.  The other siting was approximately ten years earlier on a drive between Spokane WA and Grand Coulee Dam, WA.  The object was not similar to the one described above.   Thank you and I hope you can shed some light on this unusual sighting.  P.S. Has anyone else reported this kind of object?

We use to meet up every Friday to have dicussion in different places about life or whatever, that week we decided to go to the mountains because my friend had camp there before and knew of a spot where the elavation was at the highest point of the mountain.  Anyway, we were all sitting there at the top of the mountain talking enjoying the view looking at the stars, which seem so close.  We saw an object in the sky that had like rectangle lights that were set up in a circluar motion and when one light went off the other one lit up.  It would move from the left side of the sky to the right side of the sky with then seconds.  I never seen of can even think of what man could possibly make in that could move that fast, ever since that day, I do believe in UFO.

Strange bright, white light with 4 other smaller lights. All in a diagonal row.;1998-07-31 00:00:00;non-stop;Strange bright, white light with 4 other smaller lights. All in a diagonal row. I went out to fill the dog bowl before going to bed. I saw a bright light out of the corner of my eye. I just thought it was the moon. When I turned around I saw a very bright light high in the sky. I was looking east from a small town outside of San Diego, California. I have seen bright lights before but none this bright. So I went to get binoculars. At first, the light was just bright and blury. Then I steadied myself against the house and this is when I saw something very strange. Starting from what would be one's lower left corner of a screen there were smaller lights (star-like) that were spaced apart. There were 3 of these smaller lights in a diagonal line which started at the lower left corner of view and moved up to the higher right side of view. What appeared to be right next to the 3rd light was the larger bright light. Then, still going diagonally up to the right, there was a 4th small light. It was like a perfect line. I didn't know what to make of it. I tried to capture it on video but it just shows a blurry bright white light. The smaller lights wouldn't show up on the lens with the zoom all the way out. Anyhow, I have never seen anything like this. I use the Internet a lot and decided to type in a search for anything that would give me a place to tell about this sighting. I found a site with links that led me to this page. The objects did not move at all. I don't believe it was alien, but then again I don't have a clue what could it could be. The 5 objects were aligned in such a perfect line that it is not something I think is common to see. The distance from earth that these objects appeared to be must make each of the objects very far apart from each other. I have no clue about the stars and systems in space. Maybe the bigger bright light was a satelite that just happened to be in alignment with a row of stars. If anyone has seen similar or knows what this is, please let me know. I am just curious. I have never seen anything like this. And as I write this, it is still visible. Thank you.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Faint starlike objects traveling at a very high rate of speed;2000-10-30 04:20:00;1 minute;Faint starlike objects traveling at a very high rate of speed A friend and I were looking up at the stars, at around 4:20am we noticed what looked like a very faint star moving from south to north.  The light was constant, not blinking or changing colors.  Then about two minutes later we spotted another one coming more from the northeast, but traveling in the exact same direction, like they were meeting at one point.  We followed them until we lost sight of them from the brightness of the moon.  This has happened on numerous occasions, and on each one they were traveling in different directions.  Twice they were north to south, then I also saw one moving from west to east alone on a different night.  The one I am writing about occured this past Monday.  The light seemed to be brighter than the others and was traveling from south to northwest.  About one minute later I spotted another moving from the west to northwest, going to the same point as the other.  This happened at 4:20am.  Then at 5:15am I spotted another coming from the direction the other 2 went, traveling northeast to southwest.  I have watched this go on for about 2 weeks now.  Each time I see them it is almost like clockwork.  The first couple of occasions this happened at 5:20am.  This last time it was 4:20am, two days after daylight savings time.  These lights are not aircraft because they are moving way too fast and are very high in the sky.  They blend in with the stars. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness was observing, but the descriptions seems somewhat reminiscent of satellites.  We receive many such reports.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

It appeared to look like a kite or mylar balloon.  It was like a teardrop shape, but a double teardrop.  It appearred metallic, as it was flashing white light in a rhythmic rate.  It also appeared to be green at times. It was broad daylight, and the light was visible, but did not appear to be shooting.  It hovered, moved slightly.  I lost it on the drive to the company, and after I parked, we walked back to the street to find it, and it was gone.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Wedge shaped UFO spotted over San Diego, CA 11/19/01;2001-11-19 02:30:00;10 secs;Wedge shaped UFO spotted over San Diego, CA 11/19/01 I was up late at home, and went outside to smoke a cigarette. The night was very clear, and I looked up at the night sky to see if there would be any remnants of the previous evening's Leonid meteor shower. After about 5 minutes (@2:30 am) my eye caught a motion in the northern sky (about 70 degrees), and I saw an object or group of objects traveling directly south. At first I thought it was a group of birds flying very close in a wedge or v-shaped formation, but as I stared, I'm certain that I could see a single solid wedge shape, with what appeared to be large grey bumps (possibly the same color as the object, but as if they were reflecting ambient city light). I estimate there were 5 to 6 bumps on the object. I watched quite closely to see if the object passed between my sight and any stars in the sky, and it appeared to blank out a few stars as it passed. In very quick order, I first thought they were birds when I suspected a single wedge object, what came to mind was a stealth-type bomber (B2 or F-117A). The object appeared to be cruising at approx 500 - 1000 ft, and I suspect the wingspan was 100 - 150 feet. I can't estimate how fast it was traveling. It took a straight course from north to south, and I believe it passed in and out of my vision within less than 10 seconds. As I watched, I crossed further into the yard to clear the trees, and watched as the object simply faded from sight into the night sky, never changing course. I was struck by how completely silent the object was, and the night was very quiet (not unusually quiet traffic could be heard in the distance, bird was heard afterward). If it weren't for the extreme quiet and lack of any engine glow or lighting, I would simply suspect it to be a craft from Miramar AFB (and I still think it may be). But I listened very carefully for at least a minute afterward for any type of sound, and heard nothing. I watched for another 10 minutes and scanned the sky for any other activity, saw nothing, and returned into the house. During and af! ter, I w as very calm, but a bit excited by the sight of something I had not seen before, and could not explain.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Very high in the bright blue sky, string of pearls,;2003-08-06 15:45:00;half hour;Very high in the bright blue sky, string of pearls, Working on a roof installing skylights one worker looked into the bright sunny sky and remarked what is that? I can only describe it as a string of pearls, they appeared as white dots against the bright blue sky, hanging and changing formation, sometimes v shaped then slowly changing to a straight line in relation to the ground. that is to say they bisected the earth. Several airlines passed by as this is the regular incoming flight path to San Diego airport. The planes altitude is approx, five to eight thousand feet, this (these) objects were considerably higher. As we were working we could not focus on the ufo for long, I can estimate they were visible for at least half an hour. The planes flying in must have seen them. After they were no longer visible I observed a  plane (military?) flying about the same altitude, the plane appeared quite small due to it's hieght. So I'm guessing this object(s) must have been quite large. One worker thought they were ballons, as many car dealerships use strings of colored ballons to attract attention, this object resembled that but they were all white, and no balloon would have survived such altitude.

White/Silvery kind of Boomarang shaped object, low and slow moving to the east of Lemon Grove chased by 2 Jets.;2008-04-09 11:03:00;12 minutes;White/Silvery kind of Boomarang shaped object, low and slow moving to the east of Lemon Grove chased by 2 Jets. I was sitting in my backyard enjoying a beautiful morning. While looking up at the sky,I thought I was looking at a white plastic garbage bag initially blowing in the atmosphere by the way it was moving and responding to the wind. As I watched it for a few minutes I came to realize it couldn't be a plastic bag because it was moving  slowly and with intention to the East and bags just didn't move this way. It was shaped similar to a boomarang, white/silvery in color. When it first came into view it seemed to be about 2-300ft high and almost cruising. I starred at it for about 2-3 minutes before I ran into the house to get my mother, we came back out and was able to locate it immediately. By this time it had moved slightly farthur to the east and upward. It had to be about what I consider 6-700 feet high at this time. The white/silvery color stood out against the clear blue background of the sky. And was no longer heading east, but straight up. It got to a really high altitude and kind of came to a stand still for a period of about 4 minutes then increased in speed really fast and shot out of eye sight for a while. My mother and I screamed and jumped up and down, we couldn't believe what we just saw. Eventually after about 5 minutes she went back into the house, I stayed outside hoping to see it again. About 5 more miutes went by and I kept scanning the area, I saw it and another reappear much farthur to the east, but not as high. They continued to travel southeast in a pair until they went out of my view. It took about 1 minute. About 2-3 minutes after they disappeared I noticed 2 fighter jets hauling butt in the direction in which they were traveling. I assume they were trying to track them.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Chemtrails over San Diego, Ca. the morning of March 01, 2010.;2010-03-01 06:00:00;2.5 hour;Chemtrails over San Diego, Ca. the morning of March 01, 2010. This is a ChemTrail sighting report. The aircraft were large resembling passenger airliners they were drab grey mostly and black in color. There were approximately 4-6 planes. I awoke for work at 6 am PST March 1, 2010 I live in San Diego East County near hwy 67. The sky was perfectly clear and blue near my location, except for two jet con trails going from east to west. This is not in the standard flight path for the area for either civilian or military aircraft there is no commercial flight path at this location. I work a short distance from home approximately 10 miles by road near the hwy 8 and 125. I observed at this location from 7am to 8:30 two aircraft making chemtrails traveling east to west, one was at a higher elevation, and you could see that it was an airplane but it was too high up to get details of the craft. The other plane was at a lower enough elevation to see the size and color of the plane, it had wing tips they were facing up, two jets motors on each wing, drab grey and black in color. You could not hear a jet exhaust noise from the airplanes. I observed 5 passes with this pattern it would vary in respect to starting from southeast towards northwest and starting northeast towards southwest at the high and low elevations. I could not observe the whole incident, but I saw enough to know these facts to be accurate.  As a few minutes past I  found a vantage point to look at the sky again I observed 11 chemtrails in the sky at varying heights going east to west and two from a more north to south west direction. I observed during two passes at the lower elevation after the cloud spread was starting, these planes had no chemtrails coming out of them. Slowly the chemtrails would spread out and the slight westerly breeze would push them east, you could see these cloud were stopping from the atmospheric pressure of the local mountains, so the chemtrails spread out from north to south. It appeared like there were several very, very long thin clouds stretching from east to west. By mid afternoon I could no longer feel the warm sun which I had from the morning or see bright blue sky. The sky was filled with a hazy looking cloud layer. Not any cloud I have seen, but a hazy white cover in the sky, with slight blue sky color penetrating through. As of this writing at 5:45pm PST there is still a white even haze in the sky, at my homes vantage point I can see normal puffy clouds behind the local Mt. Laguna to the east, which I see all the time as a normal weather pattern occurrence. These hazy clouds on the west side of Mount Laguna, were created from the trails of these military looking jet aircraft as I have described here. There is no round or puffiness shape to it, as with normal natural clouds, in regards to the hazy flat white layer created by these planes.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Flying, dripping red-orange globs over San Diego;2011-12-20 23:00:00;2 min;flying, dripping red-orange globs over San Diego Looked up at sky approx 11pm Tues evening - may be off an hour - and saw what appeared to be a bright red-orange airplane light low in SW sky, moving slowly as if it was a small plane.  No detail, just a light.  Really impressed me as a plane, as plenty of small aircraft fly over my area near Montgomery Field.  As it got closer it got bigger - no sound, and it was moving in a straight line.  Then it started slowly dripping small globs of red-orange light straight down (in direction of ground).  This continued for about a minute, then with the final drip the thing was extinguished itself and disappeared.  By that time it had moved from SW to W sky.  Strangely, this was the second time I'd seen this happen: about a year ago, an identical thing took place around 2am high in sky moving from S to N...that time it did not extinguish itself, but kept moving, got smaller, and finally disappeared into the N sky..plenty of drips that time, too.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Fast Moving Bright Ball Hangs Over Mission Bay San Diego;2012-08-09 21:40:00;30 minutes;Fast Moving Bright Ball Hangs Over Mission Bay San Diego At approximately 21:40 local time on 09AUG2012 my girlfriend and I were positioned on the northern shore of Mission Bay, San Diego when we noticed an object in the sky.  As we faced south we could see the object which appeared at first to be a very bright star.  My girlfriend pointed it out to me and asked if it was a star.  It became apparent that it was not. As we watched the object would move to the west in short but rapidly accelerated bursts.  The object would then rapidly change course and head to the north or several times appearing to reverse direction or wobble side to side but in a very rapid fashion.  We observed the object doing these short bursts and also observed it stand completely still.  The object would also intensify and dim in brightness but this did not seem to be related to any type of cloud cover or change in distance.  It also did not change intensity in light on any type of timed interval. After 30 minutes a fireworks display shot off by Sea World had concluded and the object seemed to remain stationary at this point.  It should be noted that when the fireworks started the object also paused for a period of several minutes then resumed its irregular flight maneuvers. I spent 8 years in the United States military during which time I was in a flight unit with fixed wing aircraft and helicopters.  I can say that this craft moved in ways I have never seen military or commercial aircraft move.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

I have to where glasses to watch movies (distance) and keep them on when I go outside to look at stars while I smoke. I was looking up in the sky and saw a bird soaring across the sky from west to east and my first thought was “wow” a hawk or eagle.  As it moved across the sky I started to realize it was different.  It wasn’t until it disappeared into the eastern horizon that I realized the following facts of what I just watched.  The bird, it had a perfect shape wings spread and all, appeared to light, not glow, just like the stars. It sailed across the sky without flapping its wings and the time it took from the moment I saw it, the upper west region of the sky, to the time it disappeared in the western side of the sky, not fully the lower horizon, could not be traversed by a bird.  And there was no wing flap, it was a perfect image of a large bird of pray moving across they sky wit! hout change. I have seen “stars” moving across the sky on these same types of moments when I step out for a smoke. I have seen what could be satellites, or some other space junk.  I have seen what are obviously are planes with the flashing lights and all. But I have never seen this.  It was a fully formed bird with wings spread, soaring across the sky without a single flap of the wings, at a height far above what a bird would soar, and a steady light, exactly like the stars. I have watched many a hawk, and even a couple of eagles, soar around the sky’s and when this was over I realized I had not seen either no mater how much it had the shape.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Three purple centrifugal ultraviolet round engines in a triangle formation pulsating centripetal burst of electric arcs..;2013-05-12 22:00:00;8 seconds;Three purple centrifugal ultraviolet round engines in a triangle formation pulsating centripetal burst of electric arcs.. I seen a large silver metallic craft that was very large, about the size of a small airfield that came over the horizon at a high rate of speed and came towards where I was standing.  The big thing upon getting closer to the shore split into three rounded triangles, all with three centrifugal ultraviolet round engines in a triangle formation which appeared to be inside the aforementioned rounded triangles of the former one which is now three large crafts.  There was a transformer like hum coming from the front rounded triangle ahead of the other two rounded triangles in a right triangle formation a possible flight mode to fool the local airport with illusory and then all three rounded triangles made a ninety degree turn and made a run for the border I assume due to the fact a Navy jet was deployed off a aircraft carried and then their was a brief game of cat and mouse and all at once the three crafts with three centrifugal lights that formed three rounded tria! ngles immerged  back into one and pulled away from the navy jet at a very high rate of speed headed South towards Mexico.  I have never seen nothing like it.  You could always see the purple glow of the three fan looking motors of all to one and then a streak that left the Navy jet at I'd say at least 3800 miles per hour.  The Navy jet goes around 1300 miles per hour and this irregular large grey silver metallic spaceship went so fast it was like it disappeared right before my eyes.  The moon was out and the city lights from San Diego made a aurora which caused the viewing in the dead of night.  Something big is getting ready to happen.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
From my perspective it looked like a long line with 4 red lights on top and 4 white lights on the bottom.;2013-08-03 21:30:00;Unknown;From my perspective it looked like a long line with 4 red lights on top and 4 white lights on the bottom. I was taking pictures of the sunset from the 9th floor window of my hotel room at the Grand Hyatt San Diego on the night of 8/3/2013.   I did not know what I had captured until I looked at my pictures the next morning.  I immediately checked the Internet and discovered that there were sightings the previous night.   The picture has not been altered in any way. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report is a very experienced photographer, who has her own website devoted to her high-quality photographs.  Hence, she is quite knowledgeable about photography.  Our opinion is that the lights are most like the strobes on an airliner, but the witness has stated that she did not see any aircraft in the sky, at the time she took the photograph.  The exposure time of the photo, she reported to NUFORC, was one second.  If the object was not a commercial or military aircraft, probably approaching  San Diego Airport, we do not know what it could have been.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Daytime sighting of a Chariot shaped object over San Diego CA.;2014-02-23 06:40:00;1 minute;Daytime sighting of a Chariot shaped object over San Diego CA. Daytime  sighting (6:40 am Sunday morning) of a 30' craft that had a “Chariot” appearance with “stacked silver-gold compartments” hovering about 250 feet above the center divide of highway 5 in San Diego.  At first I thought it might be a traffic helicopter or a loose kite which had drifted away from its owner about 5 miles south of Mission Bay.   But as we approached the object, it was absolutely still as my wife and I drove underneath it, in our SUV. We had an extremely clear visual observance of the craft which made no sound at all. My wife remarked that it “might be a drone of some sort”.  This was not a helicopter, kite, nor a “drone”.   Oddly, the sky was just beginning to clear from a fog bank, and we had just passed the SD airport which still was engulfed in a layer of fog.  It didn't make sense for someone to be flying a kite in the fog at 6:40 in the morning nor a helicopter being in the sky with that much fog and being so low to the ground.  My Cruise ! control no longer functioned properly - it worked the day before.  Right after the encounter, I glanced back at our dog that we had in a cage in the back seat - she seemed a little restless and when I turned around to look at her - her left eye looked strange.

Silver object over San Diego.;2014-04-04 16:32:00;1 minute;Silver object over San Diego While waiting for a Traffic signal at Imperial and Euclid in San Diego I was watching an inbound Aircraft coming in on Approach, and as I was watching it I noticed another object flying above it but not on the same course, the object was low enough to know it was not a known aircraft,  It was a silver color except in some places a very light blue outlining certain aspects.  The main body of it was between a circle and oval shape with a circle in the bottom of it which was outlined by the light blue color noted earlier, it also had on each side what I would describe as silver rounded off piece's that could only be described as looking like ancient style ax heads they were attached but not part of the main body.   I watch as it came over head and slowed down for a brief moment then continued on it path heading from South Southeast, towards North Northwest, then as I watched it started picking up some speed and then it was gone.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Bright flashing light on high altitude object observed in morning.;2014-08-17 07:30:00;30 minutes;Bright flashing light on high altitude object observed in morning Weather conditions: Cloudless,clear skies. Warm. A flash of what appeared like a reflected bright light caught my attention when I first observed the object at an azimuth of 190 deg T and an altitude of approx 70 deg. It appeared to be rotating at a rate of 4 sec and reflecting a bright silvery light (Perhaps catching the morning sunlight.)  It seemed to be be quite high and almost hard to find if it weren't for the flash of light.    The movement was very slow as if it were drifting.  The direction was from north to south.   My observation was from the 70 deg point to 35 deg..  The travel time was approx 10 min.   I used my 7X50 binocs to further investigate the object.  The shape appeared to be a pipelike cylnder (a ratio of 10 to 1 length to width).  It also had some sort of an arrow shaped tip.   It appeared to be at a very high altitude, perhaps space and therefore the object appeared quite small.  It continued to drift south.   I believe  it may have been some object (junk) in space that was rotating and reflecting the sunlight.   We often observe the ISS (at night), which is a fast moving object, lasting no longer than 6 min in transit..;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Ribbon like object flies across the San Diego skyline.;2014-11-26 11:50:00;5 minutes;Ribbon like object flies across the San diego skyline. Me and some of my family members were on a San Diego bay/harbor cruise in the San Diego bay. Shortly after the boat departed I saw this strange, multi-colored, ribbon like object slowly moving over the Downtown San Diego skyline.  It seemed to be attached to a red-orange ball like object. I told my family members and they all saw it.  Some other people on the boat may have seen it. The object was traveling at about 10 miles per hour.  I watched it for about 5 minutes onto it disappeared beyond the horizon. I took several photos on an IPad mini and I will be emailing one to you.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Lights in the early am.  ((NUFORC Note:  Planets in the eastern sky??  PD));2015-10-25 06:15:00;10 minutes;lights in the early am 6:15 am got up to let the dogs out right before sunrise.  Noticed to the east clouds in the distance starting to turn pink…slightly higher up  in the sky closer to me there was one large light and one smaller light in a straight line that were close enough to suggest a craft not two independent objects, and oddly the lights were somewhat fuzzy like in a bit of fog yet no fog at all.  I had the FEELING OF O THAT IS NOT GOOD…why I don’t know.  It was silent, not moving and oddly out of focus.  It SEEMED that it was something there, not two stars.  I watched it, took the dogs in fed them, and went back out it was still there…5 minutes….came back in and returned to watch the sun rise as it was brightly colored and in another 5 minutes or so I kept checking and it was gone.  I just somehow knew it was an UFO but how I don’t know and clearly it left.  Took a photo looks like nothing exciting. ((NUFORC Note:  Planets in the eastern sky??

U-shaped object with 5 lights.;2017-11-06 07:00:00;3-4 min;U shaped object with 5 lights. I was outside this morning and noticed a bright object in the sky.  The sky was clear and there were no other objects in the blue sky except a large view of the moon off to the west. I was looking almost overhead when I saw the object and what appeared to be a bright light coming from it.  I thought it might be a reflection from the sun.  I got my binoculars but the image was still not very clear, but I could see the basic shape and that it had 5 lights - not reflections.  I set up my camera and tripod to catch the object as it was slowly moving away, now at about a 45 degree angle.  I got 5 quick photos before the object was too far away to focus.  It drifted off to the southwest.  No sounds or movement/change in the lights on the object.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Bright Silver Odd shaped Object sighted for 25 min over central San Diego;2019-04-15 10:35:00;25 minutes;Bright Silver Odd shaped Object sighted for 25 min over central San Diego At 1035, I was in my front yard and saw a bright object which appeared to be stationary very high in the sky.  It was reflecting the morning sun on this fairly clear morning.  Blue sky with light clouds.  No wind.  About 66-68 degrees and sunny.  I ran in and got my binoculars and camera.  It moved very slowly across the sky from NE to SE for about 25 minutes.  At times it disappeared behind the high clouds and then reappeared.  It reflected the sun's light the entire time.  I took 59 photos of the dot in the sky.  When magnified the object was as follows: bright silver cylinder with a donut shaped object attached on top of one end of the cylinder.  My various photos showed different views of the object, so indeed it was turning around both horizontally and vertically.  My wife and neighbor both witnessed this sighting.  I verified with the local military air installation that they did not see that object even though it appeared to be above MCAS Miramar at one point.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

A vertical crescent, parachute looking thing floating through the sky during rush our in San Diego;2020-10-21 17:45:00;5 minutes;A vertical crescent, parachute looking thing floating through the sky during rush our in San Diego I was jogging and I saw this wierd thing hover in the air and it looked like it might have been over my neighborhood.  It was more vertical in shape and almost had a crescent moon shape, but like a fetus or a caterpillar.  I kind of thought it was a paraglider, I guess if the shape of that type of chute makes sense, but I couldn't see anything attached to it.  It was also kind of shiny looking and floated away at a rate that was similar to how fast a giant bubble moves through the air.  It changed position in the air a few times, so I didn't think it was hard, but it also was traveling across the sky and away, so it wasn't falling like a parachute and I was not hear a cliff, like a paraglider would use which is why it looked that, but couldn't have been, unless there was a motor?  But again, I was close enough in person that I would have seen someting attached to it.  It wasn't THAT high up.  There were a ton of other people around, driving cars, coming in and out of their homes.  I guarantee a ton of other people noticed it and probably wondered what it was, but I didn't stop to observe it with anyone else or point it out to people.  I have videos of it where you can see the buzz of traffic and other people around.  It was very obvious there in the sky.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
