Classical flying saucer desacends over San Diego.;1976-06-06 21:00:00;2 minutes;Classical flying saucer desacends over San Diego. We were sitting in a drive in movie on midway ave in san diego in late 1970's(a shopping center has now replaced this drive in movie).   We saw a round flying saucer with windows that was spinning and descending about a half mile off to the right of the movie screen.  This craft resembled the flying saucers in the tv series with Roy Thines called THE INVADERS. As far as I could tell, the craft was was descending toward the san diego bay area which borders the North Island Naval Air station on Coronado. We were amazed.  Many years later I met a man who said he also was there and saw the craft.  I am sure hundreds of people also saw it.  You might ask the audience when you are on Coast to Coast next time if anyone else remembers this event.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
A brilliant white perfect circle changes to a circle within a circle and then becomes a distant dot in the sky.;1996-06-18 08:26:00;70 seconds;A brilliant white perfect circle changes to a circle within a circle and then becomes a distant dot in the sky On or about June 18, 1996 at 8:26AM, while travelling southbound on Interstate 15 (I-15) corridor in greater San Diego, California, and in the vicinity of formerly Naval Air Station, Mira Mar, and now the Marine Corps Air Station, Mira Mar, I saw in the southeastern morning sky a round circular object. At this time (1996), I lived in North County San Diego and worked for a private, not-for-profit, Institution of Higher Education (post-secondary), which was headquartered on and along Camino Del Rio South parallel to Interstate 8 (I-8). On regular work days, Monday-Friday, I commuted to and from work using I-15 corridor, and appropriate exits taking me to and away from my office location.  I had been using the I-15 corridor since 1991 and became familiar with smaller cities between my residence and place of work along the corridor. When approaching the vicinity of Mira Mar, my daily routine was to quickly scan the morning skies (while operating my vehicle), and look for Naval fighter jets in the skies practicing ‘touch-and-go’ maneuvers at the Air Station.  As memory serves, it was customary for the fighter jets, flight pattern, to circle and approach air strip from the east when landing or touching down. On the morning of June 18, I was scanning the morning skies but did not notice any ‘human’ craft in the air.  I assumed the Air Station had their jets down in hangers conducting maintenance on them.  I did however notice what appeared to be a brief glitter in the southeastern sky.  At first, I thought it might be the sun but the sun had already risen to higher elevation.  Then I thought it might be a commercial aircraft from San Diego International Airport at high altitude and the sun’s rays reflecting off the fuselage of the craft. It suddenly appeared in the southeastern morning sky.  The object was a perfect circle, brilliant white in color but blinding to the eyes.  Using my thumb as a gauge and extending my arm out in the direction of the object, it was larger than my thumbnail and perhaps the size of a 25 cent coin (quarter).  It didn’t move it hovered as if suspended in the air. I was driving approximately 65mph, keeping up with the traffic, and flailing my left arm out the window shaking my hand and pointing my fingers upward in the sky hoping other drivers would notice and see the object as well.  This is all taking place and happening within seconds, really.  I looking up briefly, driving, and trying to get others to look-up as well. The object changes!  What initially appeared as a brilliant white circle, suddenly changed and it became two circles or a circle within a circle.  The inner circle was white but it moved like gaseous steam, rolling over and over, and it was surrounded by an outer circle that was clear and translucent.  The space between the perimeter of the larger outer circle and the perimeter of the inner circle (the circle within a circle), was transparent and there was something like a heat wave that moved between the perimeters of the circles.  It reminded me of heat waves moving across a hot desert floor that can be seen from a distance. The object begins to move.  As quickly as the object appeared, hovered, changed, and reconstituted to its original state, it begins to move southwardly in the morning sky.  Within seconds what appeared to be an object the size of a quarter, moved and accelerated its speed and was now a mere white dot dancing in the distance. The sighting incident happened within seconds, and maybe slightly more than a minute?  I honestly do not know how much time elapsed.  I do recall looking at my clock radio when I first noticed the object and hence I report the incident occurring at 8:26AM. There is more … a very unusual dream that happened several days after experiencing the sighting but perhaps that is for a different posting.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

It was moving up into the night sky at around a 40 deg. angle up into the night sky. No sound but it light up my car and my legs. The appearence was like a giant comet leaving Earth's atsmophere going up into space not across the sky or horizontal but up at an angle from the sea. The light was blinding but the tail had a lower hew or was not as bright, silver like. The ball at the end which was exactly round, was so britht white it  hurt my eyes. {every 7 yrs my Dad and I get a visitor, same looking guy each time.

It had 3 whitish yellowish lighhts and a center red light that was fairly big. I couldn't believe my eyes. I then saw it fly upward at very high speeds and it was gone bfrore I knew it. It looked approximately 20 feet from edge to edge. I noticed when it flew away it didn't fly away like i thought it would, smoothly. It flew kind of in sections, like  it would fly then stop and suddenly appear 10 ft. away. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Red, hovering, at times pulsating light seen above Pacific Beach area of San Diego, CA;2000-08-26 21:50:00;20 minutes;Red, hovering, at times pulsating light seen above Pacific Beach area of San Diego, CA Around 9:30 pm my family and I saw a very interesting non-flashing red light moving very slowly in the sky just north of us. It was definetly not aircraft of any kind we were familular with. There were several occasions wher this thing would stop, unlike anything we had ever seen. As the UFO moved south it stopped for a period of about 45-60 seconds, compleatly hovering. Periodically, the craft would almost flash and pulsate. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason. As we looked we saw what looked like lights on the side of this craft. They resembled beams coming from all around circle. At this time there was no other aircraft in the sky! As this whole incident happend we saw no airplanes at all! Being so close to Linburgh Field we always have airtraffic. There were none during this whole episode until after the craft was gone and we, within ten minutes saw several airplanes landing and taking off.This was no airplane! We all were very intersted at this time and as the craft moved north once again, it seemed to stop almost directly above us and with a very bright, very dramatic explosion the crafts former red (unblinking) lights transformed into white light and with a blink of the eye that red hovering spot we had been witnessing had vanished. There after we saw no evidence of this incident. That is of course exept for the digital camcorder recording that we have. Please share with my family and I any information on what we have witnessed tonight. It has left us all with many theories.What the hell did we see tonight?

Large, burning ball spotted drifting in the sky above San Diego on Feb. 9, 2002;2002-02-09 23:20:00;10 minutes;Large, burning ball spotted drifting in the sky above San Diego on Feb. 9, 2002 I was in my Jacuzzi, talking on the phone to a friend, occasionally glancing around the yard and up into the sky.  I suddenly spotted an orange ball, appearing to 'drift' above me, at about the height that a helicopter normally flies.  I say this because I live near the airport and am very familiar with the 'flight paths' and aircraft in the area. I was, of course, excited and curious and commented to my friend that it looked like a hot air balloon that's on fire! As I continued to focus in, I noticed that the 'intensity' of the orange color frequently changed from near amber to dark orange.  In addition, I could see 'spots' or areas of red that came and went.  The object had no clear 'definition' or 'silouhette', just roundish and glowing/burning.  I would guess the size of it to be about the same as a hot air balloon.  It slowly drifted north, then suddenly became much smaller.  At first I thought it diminished in size, as if 'burning out', but then realized it was much closer to the horizon...and MUCH further away...that it must have traveled a large distance in a moment's time.  I continued to observe it until it vanished into the northern horizon.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

I noticed that one star appeared unusually large. It was in the east sky, high from the horizon. When I reached my doorway I took one more glance at the sky before entering my home. The one huge star suddenly darted a very short distance to the north from an obvious stand-still position a moment before, and then abruptly stopped. Surprised and curious, I went in to get my binolulars for a better look. When I looked at it through the binocular lenses, I was stunned to see a round/circular object that appeared to be the size of a fifty-cent piece,as one would be to the naked eye.I clearly saw that the outer ring of the object was full of what appeared to be rows of lights close together. There was a smaller blank ring section inside that ring of lights. There was also another smaller ring section of lights inside it, and a second very narrow blank ring area with what appeared to be one large solid light in the very center of the entire object. There were four rings, two with lights and two blank,  with a center solid light in the very center of the object. The solid center light appeared to be red in colour. No sooner did I get a clear, detailed view, when the entire object shot straight up, becoming quarter sized, then dime sized, then quickly star sized. I watched it for fifteen minutes just to see if it would come back down. It didn't. Becoming cold,I went indoors.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

I went out onto my upstairs balcony to see how many were there to be fed. They sit on a tall lamp post directly in front of my home. As I looked up, I saw a large white orb/circle traveling from south/east to north/west at a fast rate of speed. It went right behind/past the direction of the lamp post. It looked completely white, not glowing. Holding my extended hand out in line with its travels, it was 1 1/2 the diameter of the end of my thumb. I couldn't judge how high it was in the blue sky but the sky to the east was blue, while to the west, high clouds had already moved in. I ran indoors to look out my window to the north/west to watch it. As it traveled north/west the clouds soon hid it.I have no idea how high the clouds were, so cannot judge how high the object was, although it moved above the clouds. The sighting was no more than two minutes total due to its rapid rate of speed and being hidden above the clouds soon after.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Three dull  yellow lights in the sky!!!;2003-12-02 18:15:00;10 minutes;Three dull  yellow lights in the sky!!! At around 1814 I was out on my balcony smoking with my wife and was looking at the night sky as I always do when ever I go out. I happen to look over in the area across from my apartment towards the stadium, and noticed what seemed like a bright landing light on an airplane over the horizon. At first I thought it was just that because it was not moving really fast or turning rather just sitting in one place. Then as I am watching this light waiting to see it turn for the glide slope for it's FAP into SD Airport another light came up from below the horizon at least from what I could see to be the horizon with a building in my view. Anyway another light came up same color and size as the one I am watching, and moved along side of the first light. These lights were a dull yellowish color not blinking or turning other colors. So with the two lights now side by side, the first one moved up and away towards the 2 o'clock position at about 1,000 feet agl, and not fast at all. It was kind of like a bump and go method the second light just stayed where the first object was while the first object moved across the horizon. Now I did not and could not see any visible beacon lights on any of the objects and was to far away to hear sounds of engines, but they were perfect in size and remained a constant dull yellow color. With the 1st object now moving away and the 2nd hovering in place, a third light of the same two I am watching moves to within about 25feet of the 2nd light and begins to hover along side. There were other IA flying all around the area some on FAP and others going to and from the costal area, but none towards these objects. I being foolish in my thinking said to myslef in my mind, I can see you and I know you are there and then I got freaked out. As soon as I said it the object I was looking at got real bright like it was flashing towards me and then all the lights were gone like as if someone turned the light swith off gone. I don't want people to think I am nuts I'm not, I am in th! e militray and know what to look for when spotting aircraft and the different types of aircraft we have.

At first we thought it was fireworks, then maybe something on fire in the sky.  Then we noticed it was slowly ascending and then it stopped and continued to hover for quite some time.  As it was hovering we noticed it had bright red jewel-like objects in the center that kept flashing, giving the appearance of rubies in the sky.  It slowly faded out of view making me think that it was moving away from view.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Now you your recent site update there are many more SAN DIEGO CA post seeing excatly what I've been seeing for months now.  There is something going on out here for sure.  I see so many strage things that I dont even tell anyone any more,  people are naturally skeptics.  I still have the videos if you will like to talk.  Last night at 2am,  I saw yet another strange sighting.  Went to smoke in my back yard,  always looking up at the sky...cause I really cant help myself anymore.  Didnt really notice anything strange..except the could were moving really fast & I could tell it was going to rain(it's raining today).  When I went back into my room as soon as I hit the bed I noticed a bright red light falling straight down from the sky.  While outside i just had a feeling I would see something for some strange reason.  As soon as I saw the light I yelled to my lady to wake up and look...indeed she saw it to.  As soon as she looked a second red light came behind it like is was following it.  We watched the light as they moved and danced until we could no longer see them.  They looked like they were coming to land on the ground,  however the rooftop of the neighbors house blocked the view.  After we could no longer see them,  me and my lady just layed back down,  neither one of us could stop staring out of the window.  I've seen many unexplained things over the last 5 months,  but this one got my heart rate pumped way up.  After we layed there for a minute,  my lady said did you nitice that there was no sound.  Minutes later an airplane flew overhead.  We both agreed that what we saw was no air plane.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Two fireballs in the night sky in San Diego;2008-09-05 23:10:00;3 minutes;Two fireballs in the night sky in San Diego Two circular round balls of fire. Perhaps two rockets that were launched at the same time? I checked the Vandenberg AFB website but it stated that there would be a launch On Saturday (the next day) close to Noon. They were moving in tandem but weren't so close together. There was a high altitude Jet passing at the same time, much higher then the objects I saw were. I don't believe nor am I suggesting that it was connected. Just wanted to mention it in regards to the altitude. It lasted a few minutes. One of the lights disappeared, then the other a few seconds later. It seemed to be moving upward and westward. They were red or orange. I am a Security Guard, don't drink, do drugs. I work at that site from 6pm til 2am, Friday through Sunday. I pay attention to detail because it is part of my job as a Guard. I wasn't going to report this but I haven't found anything to  suggest that it was the launch of a rocket(s) from what I gather.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Several people at a New Year’s Eve party noticed a single, red object that remained in a stationary position for approximately 15-20 minutes around 12:15 am.  We mentioned it to each other and kept watching it to see if it would move-everyone was making same comments that it wasn’t an airplane, helicopter, satellite or star from our observations.   We kept saying, What the hell is it?   One person from party went to another deck that had a pair of high powered binoculars and was getting them into place to look at it when it began to fade in brightness-slowly at first and then went dark.  I would say it took 30 seconds to go dark. We were located in Spring Valley and the object appeared to be a little north of Mount Helix in El Cajon.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

At approximately 40 minutes past midnight on Saturday morning 3/21/09 I observed two round disc shaped objects estimated to be 15 to 20 feet in diameter approximately 1500 feet in elevation near Mission Valley just east of my home.  Each disc had eight bright blue circular lights around the perimeter of the craft.  The lights were estimated to be 14-16 inches in diameter. They were hovering and making quick small motions darting slightly left than right and up and down. One of the two craft even slightly wobbled for a couple seconds. One of the craft than appeared to dart away completely east and disappeared.  Excited I woke my wife a she saw the same thing.  We also overheard some neighbors two houses down the street talking in an excited manner about the crafts, so we are not the only ones to have witnessed this.  The remaining craft slowly lowered down than disappeared.  One more thing the blue lights occassionally dimmed about three times and once when out completed for a second before becoming bright again. One more thing there were no sounds.

At first they just swirled and circled they were too high to have been operated from the ground as I saw that they were at a high ehough elevation that, when a plane was taking off from Lindburg Field at San Diego International Airport, it passed near the same elevation.  The other reason is that there was a dense fog and the objects were going what looked like into and out of the cloud cover.  They were flat and saucer shaped but initially looked like a ball of light.  The light pulsed, was white in nature and one changed to red. I went inside to get my boyfriend and when I came out they were gone.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Very small round object at first stationary then moved to new position, then disappeared as I watched it against a bright blue sky.;2010-10-27 14:00:00;10 minutes;Very small round object at first stationary then moved to new position, then disappeared as I watched it against a bright blue sky. I sighted an unidentified moving object from the shore of Ocean Beach San Diego California at about 2 pm October 27.  Duration of sighting was less than 10 minutes. On this day the weather was very hot and dry as Santa Ana weather gave way to clear unlimited visibility and a cloudless bright blue sky.  I was laid on my back on the sandy beach so naturally I was looking skyward.  My feet were pointed straight to the surf so my body was aligned northwesterly looking out to sea.  The 2 pm sun was about 40 degrees to my left. As I watched an airliner pass by at mid altitude (10,000 feet) I noticed it pass by a small white spot in the sky.  The spot was roundish, stationary, and had the washed out white color the moon has on a sunny day.  This lead me to think I was looking at Venus or some other celestial object though I was skeptical as I have never seen any celestial object in the bright day sky other than the moon. For the next several minutes I stared at the spot for a short while and then look away for a minute and look back up again still puzzled at what I was looking at.  Each time I looked back up relocating it took a few moments as the small spot was difficult to see against the bright blue sky so I figured I should point straight at it so I could better relocate it the next time I looked away.  I pointed about 20 degrees to my right and about 20 degrees forward (from my laying down position). I then looked away for a short while and looked back up to relocated the spot but I did not see it. I pointed my finger in the direction I had just pointed a moment ago but the spot was gone.  Now I became very curious. I scanned the sky for a few seconds and I located the spot.  The spot was stationary but was then about 15 degrees to my left. Now my attention was peaked. Now I could rule out Venus or any other celestial object.  I stared intently at the spot for about 10 or 15 seconds when suddenly it appeared to move very slightly.  Slight movement was hard to tell against a bright blue background, so I extended my left hand and finger to try and gauge movement.  In the next few seconds I confirmed the spot was moving slightly, grew in brightness, then dim and vanish.  End of story. As the observer, I want to note that I am an adult with fine far vision (no glasses).  I had sunglasses on and viewed the object with and without my sun glasses.  I was not under the influence of any drug, alcohol, or medication.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Next, I made a left turn into the train and bus parking lot where I tried recording from my car but the street lights prevented it from showing up on video. I sat and watched it hover over the home for about 5 minutes until it started to fly/hover in the direction that I was parked. This frightened me and I exited the parking lot on a side street where it then met the 101 coast highway where I turned left and looked up to try and find it while driving. I couldn't see it.

15 flying objects over San Diego.;2013-08-08 21:30:00;5 minutes;15 flying objects over San Diego. At approximately 21:30 on Thursday, 8 August 2013, during a five minute period, fifteen separate and distinct airborne objects with identical bright white lighting emerged at low altitude from southeast of downtown San Diego, flew in a gentle climb initially at a moderate rate of velocity, then began a near vertical climb until I lost sight.  They were in a very loose trail formation and maneuvered very differently from conventional commercial or military aircraft.  The lighting on the objects was constant and non-flickering.  There were no conventional red or white anti-collision lights apparent on any of the objects.  There were no red, green, or white navigation lights evident on any of the objects.  This was in stark contrast to commercial passenger airliners approaching San Diego's Lindbergh Field for landing.  The lighting and flight paths of the objects were in stark contrast to the commercial airliners that appeared to fly under the formation of the objects.  Military helicopter flight operations at NAS North Island were also ongoing simultaneously and were in stark visual contrast to the objects.  The objects did not make any sounds or noise. I am a retired Marine aviator with 4000 hours of flying experience.  What I witnessed last night was like nothing I had ever seen before.  There has been no reporting of any sightings, as I described, in any of the local San Diego media sources.  I can't imagine that no one else saw the same sight.  Close to where I was standing, four other people saw the objects and were commenting on the sighting.  I was able to take two photographs with my iPhone camera that clearly show multiple flying objects above the San Diego skyline. Can this sighting be verified?;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Orange sphere disappears and reappears in the sky seen in San Diego.;2017-03-15 19:55:00;2 minutes;Orange sphere disappears and reappears in the sky seen in San Diego. So, I was driving home this evening, and as I was pulling into the alley where I park, I could clearly see an orange light in the sky.  It was nighttime already, clear and the object was very easy to see.  It seemed stationary for the most part, until I parked and took out my camera to film.   At this point the object began to move from a northern direction towards the west rather slowly and horizontal.  I begin filming but could tell the image was hazy on my phone and did not resemble what I was actually seeing.   I heard people talking outside, so I just stopped filming and just looked at this object.  I'll try my best to describe.  It was an orange sphere and had an orange glow.  There seemed to be like darker orange lines In the center that made either a diamond or triangle shape.  It seemed as though something was in the center.  So, as the object moved, I'm questioning what it is, etc., and it begins to fade away.  It completely fades and then becomes visible again.  It was really odd.   It continues to move and does the same thing again (fades out/in) after a couple hundred feet of movement.  By this time it flew in front my apartment and I couldnt see it.  I walked south out of my alley to see if it were there and it was.  It flew at a slow rate towards the west and that was it.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

((anonymous report));2019-02-09 17:10:00;3 minutes;Looking up from my patio, I first saw what appeared to be a bird hovering almost directly overhead.  Not a bird.  Appeared football shaped with dark triangles.  One on each side pointing outward.  I went to get my phone to take picture and noticed that a spherical object to the east.  Seemed to be in the vicinity of I-5.   I started videoing it because it was moving south toward the helicopter training base.  We had about a 7mph wind coming from the ocean.  Blowing east.  Object was moving quite erratic and seemed to be in and out of focus.  Tough to follow.  I watched the item move to what I can only surmise to be about 4 blocks south and blinked out.  No longer seen by me.  I seen NO training of helicopters on that particular evening.  When reviewing video frame by frame, I noticed another object appear for less than a second.  After magnification I seen a few items, mostly globes of different sizes.  Seemed to interact.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
White circle ufos flying in formation over salton sea area;2019-10-28 10:15:00;6-7 seconds;White circle ufos flying in formation over salton sea area I was on an American Airlines flight (438) from Phoenix to San Diego when I saw a group of white circles flying in a square formation below the plane. My flight was flying west approx 20k feet and the formation was flying East at a significantly lower altitude. I would say prob at 10k - 12k feet, maybe less. Hard to say exactly. There were three or four rows of white circles with 4-5 circles in each row flying together in a very tight formation. The rows were all equal in number and each craft was the same size. The last row was missing two from the formation. The white circles were not glowing, did not have any other color or any other distinct other surface, each one was the same with no difference in size or shape.  They looked like white frisbees and from my perspective in the plane, were about the size of a Certs peppermint candy. In comparison, houses on the ground looked to be lightly larger.  The objects cast a shadow on the ground as did my plane as the weather was completely cloudless and sunny. I sighted the formation and since we were flying in opposite directions my view from the plane was very short.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Sighting was 122xxx Rios Rd, San Diego, California. We had arrived home from dinner at 18:00 driving two separate cars. My Dad and I pulled into the driveway and got out while my Step Mom was already inside. I was looking up at the the sky because it was a beautiful clear night. I noticed one round dim light that was above me traversing the sky. Object was not blinking and moved at a steady pace in one direction. Object appeared to be higher than a plane and I thought it could be a satellite. Within 10 seconds I noticed two more objects exhibiting the same behavior but moving in different directions. I felt the speed could have been similar to what you would see with a plane but the objects did not appear to be conventional aircraft due to lack of blinking lights and a! ltitude. I witnessed these lights for approximately 1 minute when my step mother came out of the house and noticed a row of approximately 10 to 12 lights, travelling west to east, about 60 degrees from the horizon and north of the front of the house. At this point all 3 of us witnessed these lights and we felt that we were observing something unusual. I watched the lights for about 10 seconds when I attempted to use my phone for video but could not capture the lights so, I went back to watching them. Some audio was captured of our reaction. Lights were dim, white and appeared to be evenly spaced approximately 3 to 4 feet between each one from our perspective. The row of lights did not appear to be one object. They appeared to be the size of small to medium stars. As we were looking to the north from the driveway, the lights travelled slightly left (north west) of us and as they reached slightly to the right (north east) of us, one by one, each light disappeared in order sta! rting with the furthest light on the right until it got to the! last on e. The total approximate time one light would travel to the time it disappeared was approximately 8 seconds. No aircraft were observed in the area during the account. In my opinion, the lights were definitely not due to atmospheric condition, reflection, flares, balloons or any known aircraft. We have never observed anything like it.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
