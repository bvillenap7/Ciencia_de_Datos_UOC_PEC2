Made hairpin 90 degree turns without slowing down. I was on the side of my house smoking a cigarette when I saw a strange light come into my view beyond the neighbors roof.  I didn't think much of it at first since I see alot of helicopters and commercial aircraft every day in this area.  As I continued to watch this light in the eastern sky, it seemed to change color and the light almost looked as if it was revolving on top of whatever this thing was. The next strange thing I noticed is that it was making no sound what so ever, and was definitely close enough that if it had been a helicopter or other commercial aircraft, it definitely would have been making noise. I continued to watch this thing travel to the south when it made a total hairpin 90 degree turn and almost seemed to change shape as it went behind the tree.  I got up and went into my front yard and continued to watch this light change color and make what looked to be impossible movements in the sky, but traveling now to the east/southeast. The craft appeared to lower up and down a few times, and then go back to the south.  It changed from blue/green to white and then to red before it traveled out of my vision behind a row of trees. I can't be sure if the light or craft changed shape, but it looked as if it did for a second...but overall it seemed to maintain a triangle or teardrop shape throughout the sighting.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
