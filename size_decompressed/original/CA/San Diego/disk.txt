((anonymous report));1978-11-20 11:30:00;10 minutes;I was on watch on the fantail on a uss warship while import in.  I looked up and seen three Green objects just hovering.  I started watching as it was my job.  They started to move to the right slowly and then stop.  Then they started to move again to the right.  As I am watching them move to the right they just took off straight up into the stars, then into the blackness of space.  I could not believe what I was seeing.  I knew there were no aircraft on earth that can move that fast.  Just like Star Trek Warp speed.  I just got into Navy and didn't want them to think I was crazy.  I didn't tell anyone until a few years later.  It's kind of messed up to see!!  Not supposed to see that stuff.

Silver disc hovering very highup in a specific triangular pattern.;1987-08-17 02:30:00;10 min.;Silver disc hovering very highup in a specific triangular pattern. One silver disc or sphere. Hovering aprox. 5 thousand feet up. I was at Torrey Pines beach on a clear summer day. Aprox. 80 degrees. Wind 0-5 mph from NW. I was in a very spiritual frame of mind, I had been meditating and focusing on healing the planet as well as it's peoples. I was laying down, face up, sunbathing. I noticed an object directly overhead very high up. I thought it was drifting at first and looked away. I looked back 30 sec. later and it was still there. So I decided to watch it. For aprox. ten minutes it hovered in a triangle pattern. It was a very specific pattern directly overhead and was not drifting. I looked away for a moment then looked back and it was still there. After another minute or so I looked way and when I looked back a minute later it was gone . I was with my girlfriend at the time and my sister in law. I didn't mention it to them because they were engaged in a passionate disscusion at the time. I didn't tell anyone about it until years later. After ten years  it happened again.

UFO seen at Camp Pendleton, San Diego, CA.;1997-03-15 21:00:00;15 minutes;UfO seen at Camp Pendleton, San Diego, CA My name is ((name deleted)), and I am a ((deleted--thirties)) year old ex-US Marine, honorably discharged. I entered the Marine Corp in 1997, and that is the year the event took place.  I heard about this on Coast to Coast, and they said to report any event no matter how much time has elapsed.  I was in boot camp at MCRD San Diego, and during my thirteen weeks there, there are several times that we were taken to Camp Pendleton.   On this particular occasion we made our way there, and had to hump (hike) a mountain by the name of Old Smokey.  Old Smokey is a mountain on Camp Pendleton that was particularly high and steep.  Three quarters of the way up you have to basically crawl up the mountain it is so steep.  I remember actually passing through the clouds on the way up the mountain it is so high.   At approximately 21:00 hours my company was getting ready to go to bed when a huge craft appeared right above us.  It was so close it seemed as though we could almost touch it.  It hovered above us as though it was looking right at us.   There was about 200 Marines looking at this enormous craft, including enlisted and officers.   After about ten mins, we heard our helicopters, and jets heading right for the craft.  When our jets came within a couple of feet, the craft sped off with speed that I have never seen before.   After it left Iâ€™ll never forget the beautiful blue like exhaust that floated in the air for about two hours.   The following day we were told by our commanding officer never to speak of what we saw.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
huge disk;1997-05-15 00:00:00;hours;huge disk This is not my own sighting but information i received from a credible source who was a fighter pilot.  I will not even say what craft he flown for fear of narrowing down his chances of being picked out.   The information is that a craft of around a mile in diameter appeared off the coastline of San Diego at night above the cloud layer.  It has multiple antennas dotting across its surface all around it.  It had bulbous mirror like windows spaced out evenly around the entire spacecraft.  Each bulb emitted randomized color effects at a normal pulse of probally 1 per second randomly on any given bulb.   When the pilots were tasked to go out to investigate the anomalous object.  There were already multiple fighter jets on station.  They flew around it for over a hour at the minimum taking pictures and video.  At some point it started pulsating rapidly then completely disappeared.   Winked out that is.   One of those pilots is a high ranking officer and one of those pilots from what I am told was a Nasa director.  This story was told in confidence because a life was saved and felt the need to relieve this information to someone other than themselves.   Collabration between the nasa director and the other pilot upon telling the story were both agreed upon.

I notice large, bright light in same spot fading on and fading out.  I brought out my binoculars, which is 12 X 50W Minolta. I could distinct see a walnut shape craft with extremely bright lights.  There was a black comb-like shape with very bright halogen-type brightness between the black frame.  Above and below the elongated lights was a much smaller set of lights without the black frame.  At one point I gave a hand-signal to the craft when the lights faded and it immediately came on again.  I distinctly felt this craft was extraterrestrial and watching me. ((short deletion of personal information)) The sighting lasted about fifteen minutes. On Sunday I went mountain climbing and happened to see a jet's contrail high up in the sky and decided to take a photo of it.  When I got home and put the digital photo clip in my computer, the image of the contrail included an almost invisible roundish shape in the photo.  My digital camera takes flawless images and I've never had a camera flaw from any photo I've taken.  I've read that ET craft such as from the Pleidian craft (And yet... they fly! by Guido Moosbrugger) have the ability to make themselves appear almost invisible, such as the image I have. I reported this initially to the FAA and they referred me to NIDS.  The contact their, Roger, told me the image I have is probably a 'camera flurry.' I am not convinced of that knowing my camera's extreme accuracy. I would be glad to e-mail you a copy of the image I took on Sunday, February 9th.\ ((NUFORC Note:  We will request copies of the alleged photos.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

I was so close I could've hit us. My and some firends were on the 5 freeway traveling north and we saw the object floating around the area. there were many cars around at the time so im prestty sure more people have seen it. We were to scared to stop and observe it so we kept on driving. I pulled out my video camera but ...couldnt capture enough detail of the object on time. .....Just the light floating around the sky.....However I clearly saw the UFO and could describe it as a disc looking shape. It had lights around the trim of it and moved in a graceful motion. It moved across the freeway...leveling itself up and down!!!with a blazing thick ray of light bursting off the bottom as it shoots up into the sky.. It was about the size of a car but only about half the height. A round disk circular shape...It was a moment ill never forget...too bad i couldnt pull my camera out on time...but ill never forget what we saw out there...whatever it was...it was an experience ill never forget.it truly looked like a ufo !!!! this is for real...

It was a clear morning.  In the northern sky, a copper disk with a black spot in the center covering about 1/2 the entire area on top.  It was disk shaped & one end of the disk was about twice the diameter with a wedge cut out at the larger end.  The wedge appeared to be about 1/16th of the entire circumference.  It appeared to be about 3000 feet above sea level.  We needed binoculars to see them clearly.  At first there was only one.  The 2nd appeared & about a minute later they both disappeared.  I only saw one, but one person saw two.  I only know that one was moving in a clockwise small circle & was tipping up on end as it went in the circle. It tipped forward all the way & then backward all of the way.  It did not turn upside down, but just showed the top & bottom as it turned. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Small, disk like object with blue lights flying over Chula Vista, Ca at South Bay Drive-In Movie Theater in July, 2007.;2007-07-27 22:00:00;30 seconds;Small, disk like object with blue lights flying over Chula Vista, Ca at South Bay Drive-In Movie Theater in July, 2007. I was watching The Simpsons Movie at a drive in movie theater in Chula Vista, Ca ( south of San Diego) at around 10:00p on July 27 or 28, 2007. I saw a bright light to the east and my boyfriend saw the same object. We both grabbed each others arms and looked in that direction. I saw a round, disk like object with blue lights around 10-15 ft in diameter floating to the left of us. We saw it for approx. 10 seconds and it zipped away in the most odd, quick, zig zag motion i've ever seen and then it shot up going faster than anything i'd ever seen before and it disappeared into the sky. Less than 3 minutes later, there were 3 Army helicopters ( we are in San Diego- Army and Navy base central) were flying over us- so loud that everyone around us could not hear the movie. I'm sure i'm not the only one who saw it- there must have been 100 people at the drive in movie. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Three Brilliant UFOs of various shapes in close proximity to each other.;2008-02-27 19:00:00;14 minutes;Three Brilliant UFOs of various shapes in close proximity to each other. Wife called me not 15 minutes ago coming west into Ocean Beach from the I-8 freeway screaming, They are back & they are all over the sky. And being that this area has been a crazy hotbed of activity I flew outside & low & behold there were 3 HUGE UFO's between 800 to 1500 feet off the ground making the most awesome manuevures that I haven't witnesses since November of 2007. The one closest to the ground appeared to be just a burning bolt of gold undulating/ cycling gold ripples downward. The second one closest to the bolt appeared as a wing doing spiral 8 patterns & the highest was a whitish corona with the classic saucer shape inbedded and what I found unbelieveable was that this certain one looked exactly like the crafts, (crap)? I thought as such anyways - Ed Walthers was getting from his Gulf Breeze shots. Totally strange to even a glimpse of something resembling this because I never took his pics. seriously. I'm in awe. My little sister buzzed me 20 mins. later freaking, Bro Beam - You were so right because I can see 3 of them right now & I just left the OB area going east out the I-8. $200.00 more & I get the gem i've been saving for & HOPING that an event like this wouldn't transpire UNTIL I got it. Total viewing time for objects 10-13 mins. & approx. 12 mins. after the 3 flickered out, sure enough helicopter city ensues. Thats it folks. LOOK UP!;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
low flying saucer in suburban area.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

When I looked up I saw a disk shaped saucer with a raised area in the middle, maybe for the pilots head/body. It was over a residential area moving right to left towards homes. It had no lights on at the time but it was close enough to see that it did have them. It flew too fast to be a helicopter but too slow to be a jet. were maybe 100 to 150 yards away from it but it made absolutely no sound. It was way too big to be a remote controlled toy, I would guess it was a one man craft. It looked like the classic saucer design from old alien movies. It was dark so it was hard to make out an exact color but I would say it was a dark metal gray. As far as size I'd say it was 15-20 ft. in diameter. If you have any info on this I would love some feedback as Im not a UFO enthusiast and I have no explanation for this. Im %100 sure that what I saw was real. Like I said it was very close, VERY surreal. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  We cannot certify that this report is intended as a serious-minded description of an alleged sighting.

It took me a second to realize that they werenâ€™t airplanes or even helicopters.  Before I had enough sense to take a picture with my cell phone to show some actual UFO proof to my friends and family the two disks quickly escaped my view.

Saucer shaped object, over the seas of San Diego,brightly illuminated by the sun, seemed too blend it self in to the colors of the sky.;2009-06-23 15:00:00;30 minutes;Saucer shaped object, over the seas of San Diego, brightly illuminated by the sun, seemed too blend it self in to the colors of the sky. I was looking up at the bright clear blue sky.  I then, suddenly saw an object moving slowly across the horizon.  At first I thought it was a plane, until I noticed it was saucer shaped and the light of the sun was reflecting off the whole surface of the object. My eyes continued to follow it when it disappeared as if nothing was there. I continued too watch the sky hoping to see it again.  I then saw it not once, but another time about five minutes apart. This time I realized that the object did not disappear, but actually slowly faded in too the colors of the sky. It was if it had cloaking technology. This happened over a thirty minutes time span.  As near as I can tell it was flying over the Pacific ocean, maybe even over the naval bases.  Also of note as soon as the object appeared, the winds started to pick up very strong and fast.

When I went out tonight to collect my mail, I witnessed a disk/flat shaped craft surrounded with bright/deep blue lights, and also red lights.  They appeared to be 1/2 and 1/2.   The object/craft was below the very high cloud cover and was in the West sky. As I watched it, it darted at a rapid speed, shooting back/forth, up/down.   A neighbor came outdoors to take her trash out, and I pointed to the craft, telling her what I had observed.  She looked up at it, stating she knew, as she had been watching it from her apartment balcony but didn't know what it was.   As we both stood watching it do racing/darting acrobatics, it suddenly shot straight up...then raced at a very high rate of speed to the North, out of sight.  The speed and ability to maneuver as it did made it impossible for it to have been any typical aircraft.  We heard no noise.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

While looking at the beautiful sky I spotted 1 object in the N-NE sky in a section of sky without any clouds.  It was too far to distinguish the shape.  Closest would be either a disk or saucer.  It was white or silver, no sound. I watched it travel a short distance to the SE, then reverse right back to the NE, then reversed again to the SE, then suddenly, simply disappeared.

Saw what appeared to be 2 circular or disk shaped objects flying near each other.   It was a dark grey in color and there were green lights on the outer edge.  So it was really visible.  First I saw it out the front of my front windshield hovering, seem to come out of nowhere not sure.  Then it floated above us and was on the right side of the car.  There was no sound.  With it being that close I would expect to hear sound if it were coming from a helicopter or something like that.
