Enormous object to star like size in a flash;1974-06-15 20:00:00;3+min;Summary : Enormous object to star like size in a flash I was carrying my 3mo old daughter accompaniedby my wife and 5 or more strangers were nearbyDusk waschanging to dark, the area was well lit, welloccupied by people, and somewhat busy asMission Beach is at that time of year.What appeared to be an object on fire overheadsoon became an large,dark,round object thatseemed to loom above us in silence with whatappeared to be lights around its exterior.the object was either the size of a city blockand close to the ground 500-1000ft or it wasincredibly huge and much higher in elevation.I started to walk away because of fear formy infantdaughter but stopped to look back, when I didit instantly disapeared until my wife pointedit out to all of us as a tiny star like objectmoving quickly south (faster that a fighter jet)It then stopped abruptly and a object bestdescribed as lite, no lite, lite, no liteflashed across the sky westerly in a straight- - - - - -line, then it resumed its fast flightdue south and faded out of sight.That evening there were reports of strangelites off shore facing west.The strangest co-incidence to this story isthat the San Diego Union reported the nextmorning that a main electrical sub-station ineither the Phillipines or the Marshall's hadbeen scorched and burnt and shut down - causeunknown, that previous evening.Further, a similiar sighting just two+ weekslater in a major Florida city came up with asimiliar result i.e a scorched & burntsub-station.I've got an extensive radar and aircraftand missile background and not easilyled or fooled. This was strange and we'vekept it to ourselves until now.Thanks to you and Art Bell, I'm talking.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
1977, Intense blue light over San Diego.;1977-06-15 21:30:00;five seconds;1977, Intense blue light over San Diego. The end of Balboa Avenue in San Diego used to be a cul-de-sac before it crossed I-15. A friend and myself were about to smoke a bowl of marijuana (no, we had not yet lit up..., that's why we were there, it was easy to view police coming.) when the whole sky, and the interior of our car lit up bright turqoise blue. Probably closer to the color of plasma that anything else I've seen. I was in the passenger seat facing west, and somehow, I knew to thrust my head forward into the windsheild area an look straight up. Not an easy task in a volkswagon bug. There about 300 feet up was an unmarked bright blue sphere hovering motionless. I know it was 300 feet because it was in the cloud cover which was rather dense but still had enough patches to see the moon. (Almost full or full) From my perspective, it appeared to vanish. From my friends perspective, he saw it take off from the south...which was sometype of aerospace facility, now abandoned but still in place, 2003. Six other persons came racing down to the base of the cul-de-sac and exclaimed Did you see that thing fly by the moon? They said it had done so in about a half second. Pretty fast. We all sat around in shock for a while and then dispersed. We did not exchange names, I guess it's not the first thing that come to mind in such an 'alien' situation. To be clear, I don't know what it was. It just wasn't of this world. Perhaps a UFO, angel, advanced being. It could have been anything. Although I did get flashbacks of having been onboard a craft of some type for several years after the event. The disappointing thing was that the next day, even though people in a sixty mile diameter had seen the sky over San Diego light up, the news claimed  The strange light in the sky last night was a power station explosion. I've never trusted the media since that night, and suggest you don't either. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
A metalic sphere flew across the daytime sky.;1996-01-01 12:00:00;30seconds-1minute;A metalic sphere flew across the daytime sky. I was outside picking peaches around mid-day when i spotted a completely spherical metallic object, (very large, but not sure exactly how large)flying gracefully across the sky. It flew relatively slowly. It had no apparent windows or doors, and was silver in color.I watched it for about 20 seconds, then ran inside to get some binoculars. I couldn't spot it again by the time I ran back outside. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

It then almost stopped and began falling as if like a leaf falls, disappearing behind tress and houses in the east. Then from the area where I last saw it (after about 2 minutes elapsed) a streak of light appeared across the sky and disappeared in the western horizon. Then 2 minutes later a streak appeared from the northern horizon to the southern horizon, like the one before but opposite direction. The streaks were like something that moved across the entire visible sky at outrageous speed. I was in my back yard looking at jupiter at 2:15 am on 08/28/98. I was facing the east when something caght my eye. That something was floating out from behind some trees to the south and was approximately 60-70 degrees from the eastern horizon when it started drifting and falling as if like a leaf falls, until it disappeared behind some haouse and trees. This object was completely round and not as bright as jupiter although it was 5-6 times the size of jupiter and approximately 1.5 miles away. It was a yelowish green orange color. After 2 minutes had elapsed something went very fast from the eastern horizon to the western horizon in a split second. Then 2 minutes later something streaked very fast from the northern horizon to the southern horizon. These streaks were the same spherical object that I had seen before, although I can not say for sure because it was moving too fast to decipher. I have seen meteors, bolides, satelites, and Iridium flares of all kinds . I had never seen anything like this before.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Rotating disc appeared, approached slowly then disappeared. On July 10th at the baseball stadium in San Diego, I saw a UFO during the game. I am a telepath and a clairvoyant, so when I heard the message to look up you I might see a UFO, the only reason I hesitated was because I didn't want to look silly staring up at the sky while everybody else was looking at the game. I heard an airplane overhead, so that gave me a good excuse to look up. I looked above the plane and saw what appeared to be a white sphere. At this point I removed my sunglasses and put on my prescription sunglasses so that I could see clearly and they are not as dark. At first, I thought it must be a balloon except it remained stationary. Fortunately, three balloons were then released, so I then had the opportunity to compare the shape and movement of the balloons with the perfectly stationary, perfectly round sphere. My boyfriend was sitting directly in front of me. I discreetly asked him to look at the object and tell me what he thought it was. He said it was probably a balloon. I said I didn't think so and asked him to observe it for a while. About two minutes later he said, adamantly, That is NOT a balloon! It flashed! There was a girl sitting next to us. She asked what we were looking at. I told her it was a UFO, so then she began to observe its behavior, also. The UFO then disappeared for about a minute. It then reappeared, but it was now a little closer. About a minute later, it disappear again. It then reappeared, again. I decided to communicate with. I told them that I loved them and would they please come closer and prove to me that it was actually an extraterrestrial spacecraft. What followed next was truly incredible for me. It made a series of 90 degree angles and zigzags in rapid succession, ending with an exit to the left at an incredibly high rate of speed. It took my breath away. About a minute later, I observed another craft appear in the area from which the first one exited. This one had a flatter or disc-like shape as it moved toward me. It was extremely bright and sparkly, and rotated like a mirrored disco ball. It was absolutely gorgeous. After about two minutes, it just blinked out and did not reappear any more. I quickly called a UFO investigator on my cel phone so that I could have a record of the time.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Very bright and green...heard about these on Art Bell over the last few months, but first time in 45 years seeing one! I've seen lots of meteors...but this things was huge and was very strange because it didn't appear to burn-out just went to far down in the horizon to see it any more and it never became smaller either. Plus because it had obviously brighter areas on it, which gave it a kind of 3-D appearance and was fuzzy all around the edges of the sphere. I was with my fiancee when we both saw this, which I was very glad that he had also seen it since I he had been with me two nights ago when I saw another odd object in the sky(see earlier report form). I was coming back from picking him up from his work place tonight.  I called two local TV stations but no one else had called it in. Channel 8 asked for my name and phone number, and Channel 39 said to call back and speak to their meteorologist, which I will in a few minutes.

Brilliant white spheres above south fortuna mountain in San Diego.;2003-02-07 10:25:00;45 seconds;Brilliant white spheres above south fortuna mountain in San Diego. I and a friend went down to San Diego's Mission Dam area for a walk because it was such a beautiful day. The sky was unusually blue and clear with occasional white clouds. The sighting occured in the Mission Dam park itself. We were standing at the side of the paved road facing northwest, about 1/2 mile north of the visitor center, looking up towards south Fortuna Mountain. We were feeling kind of lazy and were just gazing at crows as they flew from the top of Fortuna Mountain down near the bottom of the canyon and back up again. After a while we were just looking around and noticed that the crows seemed to have left. I looked around for them and noticed that they were circling at the top of south fortuna and pointed it out to my friend. We were both looking at them and then I said look seagulls are circling above them realizing that they were not seagulls! My friend then said those aren't seagulls We were looking at about 8 brilliant white spheres doing circles and right angle turns at various hights up to about a mile high or so. They were obviously not birds, but the crows were circling under them which was really strange. We watched them in awe for about 45 seconds and then they were just gone in an instant! The crows were still there though. We stood there for a while hoping they would come back but they didn't after an hour had passed, while we talked about them. I didn't take any pictures because I didn't have a camera with me.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
2 lights hovering around south san diego, bordering tijuana.;2004-06-30 22:00:00;20 minutes;2 lights hovering around south san diego, bordering tijuana. H1, although this event occured roughly 2 years ago, I felt that I wanted to share my story after watching a few documentaries of UFO's on television.  To begin, my family had a small get together at my house for dinner, and after we were just hanging out with my younger nieces and nephews playing video games. After the games, my cousin and I went out for a walk in my street, it was about 9-10 pm. Just about 2 houses away from my house, something from the sky caught my eye. I looked up and I saw 2 spheres(?), can't clearly classify it because the objects were far away, however they were clearly visible due to their illumination. After spotting the objects, I looked at my cousin, in which he was staring at it in the same amazement as well. Having to be skeptics of everything, i quickly suggested that it was an airplane or star of some sort. However, my theory was proven false after 10 minutes of staring at the objects. See, we've always noticed that airplanes have blinking lights, however these objects did not have any. Another thing, these objects moved in a wierd manner that they were like chasing each other. Also, after moving fairly fast, (unfamiliar to our eyes )they would just stay in place and be stationary for a minute or 2. Later they would resume moving around. Having to be a bit scared, my cousin and I were satisfied that these were UFO's. However, it doesnt stop here. After 10 minutes, the objects would suddenly dissappear in a flash, either they migrated in the speed of light, or they just turned off all their lights. So my cousin and I were looking everywhere, and still no sign(let me note, it was a clear night no clouds). 30 seconds or a minute later, they would reappear again and do the same routine, they would chase each other around and then stop all of a sudden and hover in the air. However it gets even wierder, one of the objects shoots some kind of light(laser), in which the light dissappears after a while it has been shot. We were thinking, that either the object shot the light towards the other object, or towards the ground, i don tknow, because like i said the light dissappears after a while it travels in the air. After all this they become stationary again, and all of a sudden one of the objects flashes away into the sky, and the other one follows. (again in such a speed, not familiar for us to observe). The whole siting took about 20 minutes, and those 20 minutes were standing in the same exact spot that we were, when we first spotted them. And believe me, after we saw those UFO's my cousin and I were still in awe of what we just saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

White or silver sphere moving fast and erratically across horizon and against the wind;2004-11-01 16:15:00;:40 seconds;White or silver sphere moving fast and erratically across horizon and against the wind Small white or silver spherical object tracked across the horizon in a zig-zag W-to-E pattern over 19 photos.  Thought it mught be a weather balloon, but official wind data from NOAA that day indicates winds out of the NW (the direction needed to push a balloon to the east) only at altitudes above 12,000'.  So if the object was at or below 12,000', it was moving agaisnt the wind.  However, even at 12,000', the object's velocity would have been over 310 nautical MPH, approx. 7x the highest recorded wind speed for that day.  My calculations would have to be off by a magnitude of 10 (I'm a mathematician) for this object to have been a balloon.  I can mathematically prove it was not.  I am e-mailing a photo on which I have marked it's location in each of the 19 shots.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

I almost didn't see the 6th because it was lagging so far back.  they moved in a southeasterly direction until i could no longer see the 6th light.the lights where all the same in color, white to amber, not blinking, but bright enough to see. no clouds were in sight and there were no other objects (i.e. stars) around.

2 spheres;2005-06-15 16:00:00;2 min;2 spheres it was about 4pm in old town san diego california june 2005. the day was a almost perfectly clear blue sky with a slight breeze. i laid down in the grass looking up at the sky on the old lawn at a historical site. as i was looking at a jet airliner fly over i noticed two object under the planes flight path.  at first they seemed unremarkable and i could not make out what they were. i kept looking, the more i looked the clearer they became.  they were two spherical objects, silvery metalic in nature and tumbling in their fixed postions the way a bubble would seems to tumble. the more i looked the more i realized i was looking at something strange with movement not within the laws of any physics i am aware of.  i asked my friends around me to look up and see them, however to my luck all were with bad eyesite. no one could see them. the fact that they could not see them was almost as unbelievable as the objects themselves.  i kept looking. they became clearer and sometimes i could make out red areas as well. they seemed to have an irregular surface with portions of it being split like yet were generally spherical in over all shape with no wing like stucture of any kind.  where they balloons? no they did not move from there fixed positions, unaffected by wind. i even used the tree branches as a point of reference to make sure they were not adrift.  where they kits? no because they were to high. also i have never seen a kit tumble and again they were to fixed in the sky.  was there any sound? none that i could detect.  i would guess their size to be 20 feet in diameter.  it was at this point i began to wonder if they were something alien. then one started to move. it moved slowly and deliberately in a clockwise manner, 15 degrees keeping its relative distance from the other and then suddenly stopped.   i kept thinking to myself i want to see how they fly off. but in despiration to get my friends to see it i looked away to call a friend at some distance. then when i looked up, they were gone. in the vast clear blue sky in all of that air space, i looked and looked. they disappeared.

4th of July surprise.;2005-07-04 12:00:00;40 seconds;4th of July surprise. First off, I'm not crazy.  I don't hunt UFOs or even believe in ghosts.  I have seen questionable lights in the sky, even 6 of them 30ft away from me but I still question those and can't confirm they were alien or UFOs.  But this one is different,.  It had dimension and reflected the ground.  Plus it moved. It was on the 4th of July 2005. I was at a holiday party, in the back yard of the house next to a swimming pool.  Ever since I was a kid, I usually like looking at planes take off and land.  So when I was in the back yard and heard an approaching plane, I instinctively looked up.   While I was facing north. I heard to the left of me, a plane approaching.  So I looked at it and thought, cool, a C130 military plane is approaching.  Which made it even more interesting to look at.  Right behind the plane was a small round object. My first thought was that the lane was towing something.  As it got closer and closer, I kept looking for a tow line, a chord, a rope, a wire,... something to make sense that it was towing this round object.  Then as it was almost right above me, I saw that the object was shiny with a chrome-like reflection.  That's when it hit me that this is the orb stuff I've heard of in the past.  So I opened the sliding back door and yelled for people to come out! and see this cause I didn't want to be the only one seeing this.  They all tool their time to come out cause they thought I was crazy.  While they were coning, I tried to pull my Iphone out to take a picture or video, but the stupid phone took a long time to boot up and initiate the camera.  While I was waiting, the plane had already past me and moved on to my right.  So I'm looking at the back of the plane now.  I can still see the orb behind it, but it started to move slowly to the left of the plane.  So I naturally freaked out some more.  By the time I got the camera working, the plane was too far to see anything and the people who came outside to see couldn't make out anything themselves.  That's my story of what happened.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
UFO's in sunny San Diego California;2006-09-17 20:00:00;5 minutes;UFO's in sunny San Diego California Every night it seems that from the front yard of my friends house on 35th st in Shelltown, all the way above us luminescent lights, balls, whatever you want to call them, always appear.  Airplanes? They can't be because these things are lit up all around consistently from every angle as they move across the sky.  Helicopters? Neither because helicopters cannot fly at that altitude.  The only thing that it might be are satellites but, satellites dont just stop in mid air, or they dont zig-zag during travel.  Another thing, they seem to be moving very fast at times and other times, very slow.  They look exactly how the stars in the background look, same color and size, so sometimes it is hard to spot them, and I'm pretty sure they pass by unnoticed.  It is weird because when you tell someone that hasn't seen them, and you're out there trying to spot one, when you do, and are about to tell them to look up, they just disappear, as if they know your showing them to someone else.  It's happened to me a couple times.  They believe me until that person spots them for themselves, at a different time. Last, sometimes after these things disappear, you can spot an airplane or jet that is out of place from normal air traffic.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

When I was preparing to take video of it, the sphere started to fade away.  At first we thought it was moving behind a cloud, but we realized that the whole time we could see it through the clouds.  It was more as if it took off away from us, at high speed and all you could see was a small dot then nothing.  This is my second time reporting about objects like these in the same area(2 miles east of downtown) except this time, the object was much closer than before.

I know that around the area there is a large vacant field which is part of the Miramar Air space which the military uses for training. I also know that less than a mile away from were I was at there is a weather doppler which was the location that I assumed the weather ballon was coming from. Although I never saw any bright lights and I only notice one ballon (my brake was only 10 minutes long) others could have been released.

Not much detail could be seen except the color, and they appeared to be moving southwest but also at an up angle as they were getting dimmer.

They were a unique color and at first didn't look like anything unusual until they started moving.  It was smooth but erratic and unlike any conventional flying machinery.  They would speed up and slow, turn corners quickly.  One appeared to have an even smaller orb orbiting it as it moved.  My husband said he saw a few like that but I only clearly saw the one.  There was also an airplane trail of clouds and the orbs clearly were under those clouds, so closer to the ground than an airplane.

Black sphere over San Diego airport flying against the wind north to south.;2012-09-22 16:45:00;60 seconds;Black sphere over San Diego airport flying against the wind north to south Yesterday, onn Saturday September 22 at about 4:45pm (give or take 5 minutes), I had a sighting here in San Diego, California.   I was viewing this sighting from about 2 miles southeast of the intersection of Interstate freeways 5 and 8 in the community called Mission Hills.  Most of the sky was covered in tropical clouds but there was one large section south and southeast of me which was mostly open blue sky (just a few small clouds).  This open area would be over the San Diego airport.  The clouds were moving southwest to northeast pretty fast.  I saw one round black object that was moving against the wind from north to south towards the San Diego airport.  This black object was not moving fast, but was clearly moving against the wind.  When I saw this object, it was not directly over me, but already southeast of me.  The black object was round and it appeared as a sphere.  At the time of the sighting, I could not tell how big it was other than it was lar! ger than a weather balloon, but smaller than a commercial jet.  It was just below the few clouds that were in the open area.  These clouds were dipping a little, like it was raining up in the clouds, but the water was not hitting the ground.  The black object was traveling below the main part of the small clouds, but through the wispy part of the clouds that were dipping down.  This object, if it was a balloon or a floating object, would have been traveling with the clouds but there was no doubt, none, the object was moving north to south against the wind.  This object was did not look like a disc, but more like it was round or a sphere.  I saw it for about one minute.  This object was round and black.  The black color did not reflect or shimmer but maybe it was rotating.  I did not see it rotate, but there was a rhythmic change from solid black to something other than black.  It would be solid black most of the time, and then a reflective shimmer for a short time.  It was not like the reflective shimmer you see when there is an aluminum balloon floating by.  There are no words for it, but maybe half-way between simi-transparent and the aluminum reflective shimmer of a balloon.  I don’t know if that makes sense but the object was a solid black round object for most of the time, but then for a short few seconds, it would almost become transparent.  And then back to black, a very solid black.  I should have timed the rhythmic change but I did not think of doing that during the sighting.  There were no lights on this object and it did not make any sound.  After a minute, it was too far away to see.  I did not have a camera with me.  I had that sighting yesterday afternoon in full sunlight.  I was not able to judge the size of the craft but this morning, Sunday morning, a military transport jet flew by the same location at the same elevation, just below the clouds.  So now, since I just saw a jet about in the same location, the black object I saw yesterday would be the size of the tail wing section but of course, filled in as a sphere. ((NOTE FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC WEBSITE)) Anyway it may be minor but I found one suspicious report in my own neighborhood or perhaps the reporter was just confused. San Diego, 9/22/2012 16:45.  Witness twice stated that the object that they witnessed  was South and Southeast of their location (In Mission Hills.) over the San Diego Airport ( Lindbergh Field?). That airport is SOUTHWEST of Mission Hills. Of course this could be a typo. They stated that the wind was from the southeast to general North, the exact opposite of the norm in this area but not unheard of. They further stated that this was one reason they were awed as the craft flew against the wind ( Eliminating balloons.). Well if the wind direction they described was accurate then aircraft landing at Lindbergh Field would in fact be landing in the direction of the craft sited. As this is unusual, likely the witness has rarely if ever seen aircraft in this pattern and mistook a final approach for an unknown object. I also note that the time, 16:45 is prime landing time at Lindbergh. ((END));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
3 white lights with no collision lights heading north from San Diego within a 12 minute period;2012-10-09 17:35:00;12 minutes;3 white lights with no collision lights heading north from San Diego within a 12 minute period On Tuesday October 9, I saw 3 separate lights or crafts in the evening sky here in San Diego, California which did not have collision lights. I was viewing this sighting from about one mile north of the San Diego International airport. There were considerable clouds at that time so I could only see about 30 percent of the sky.  The clouds were broken and irregularly spaced. The first sighting was at 7:35pm and it was of a single light.  The second sighting was only 12 minutes later at 7:47pm and it contained 2 lights or crafts.  The second, or later sighting, was much closer and was at the same level as the low clouds.  These 2 lights or crafts had just passed over my house, or I assume they had passed over my house but anyway, they were already a little north and a little east of my house, almost overhead and traveling NNE.  These 2 crafts were close to each other. If I stuck my hand out in front of me, 3 fingers would represent the distance between the crafts! .  One craft or light was ahead of the other one and it was brighter.  They were traveling faster than the jets do in this area. I saw them for 10 seconds before they went into the clouds.  They were traveling NNE, which would make them cross the normal jet traffic which goes west to east before turning around to come back to the San Diego Airport to land. I did not see any commercial aircraft in the area during this second sighting. The first sighting was a single light almost overhead, but a little east. This light or craft was very high. It could have been mistaken for a satellite, but it was not a satellite. It was traveling too fast to be a satellite. I saw this sighting for about 10 seconds also before it was hidden by cloud cover. I did not hear any noise from any of the crafts. I should have heard noise from the second sighting since they was so close almost directly overhead when I first saw them.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Single white light or craft passed over and very close to a commercial jet.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly the ISS?  PD));2012-10-10 18:56:00;4 minutes;Single white light or craft passed over and very close to a commercial jet On Wednesday October 10, from 6:56 pm to 7:00 pm, or 4 minutes, I watched a single light cross the early evening sky here in San Diego, California.  I was viewing this sighting from about one mile north of the San Diego International airport. There were some clouds, but I still could see about 70 percent of the sky.  This single white or slightly blue-white light was traveling slowly SW to NE slower than the commercial jet.  I first saw this single light south of me and it flew almost directly overhead, but slightly east of me and then continued in a straight line NE till I could not see it any longer. It was traveling just above the lowest fluffy clouds.  After it passed me, while heading NE, it went just above a small cloud at the same time that a commercial jet which was traveling through the same cloud. The jet was flying west to east preparing to turn around east of the San Diego Airport and then land. They were not very far apart but I don't know how far! apart.  They basically were in the same cloud. I could easily see the front white light of the commercial jet as well as the wing lights and collision lights before it went into the cloud.  The single light had no collision lights.  At this time of night, the sky was not black, but a blue black. Not only could I see the lights on the commercial jet, but I could still see the outline of the wings, the body of the jet and the tail section.  The single light did not have any wings or anything visible other than the light itself. I am sure I would have been able to see wings if this single light or craft had wings.  The single light was less than a quarter the size as the outline of the jet.  Again, the single light or craft passed just above the cloud and the commercial jet went through the cloud.  They crossed paths at that time. I did see both crafts continue on their paths after they crossed.  The single light or craft made no noise. I could hear the jet.  The single light was clos! er to me than the jet.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

As soon as I looked up, there was a shinny silver sphere underneath the plane and continued to hover as the plane passed by.  It then driftet southeast slowly, then to disappear instantly.  Which is very strange as the object seen was very clear, then to vanish within a blink of an eye;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Two orange spheres one ejected a ball of white light;2014-06-20 02:00:00;10 minutes;Two orange spheres one ejected a ball of white light At 2 am, I went out to my second floor balcony to smoke.   Coming from the east 2 orange balls what I thought were probably airplanes moving slowly to the west.  I couldn't see any of the typical red light on one side green on the other.  I thought perhaps they were headed to the airport a few miles away.   Their distance apart remained about the same.  The one behind appeared to stop for a few moments but they were traveling slowly so I wasn't sure.   While this was going on  a helicopter began circling the downtown area with its strobe light on.  It made about three passes.   Not unusual, there are helicopters out every night.  I thought the helicopter would report anything unusual and I would read about it in the morning.   The forward one then turned south.  As it almost went out of sight, I swear a small ball of light was ejected from the bottom.  The one behind that seemed to hover for moments turned south and very slowly disappeared in the distance.   I went ! back in my room to watch Highway patrol and noted it was around 02:10 and I hadn't missed too much of the tv show.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Orb over San Diego 10 Sep 2014.;2014-09-10 18:30:00;45 min;Orb over San Diego 10 Sep 2014. I pulled into my driveway at around 6:30 p.m. on 10 Sep 2014.  I saw an object just to the right of my home and seemed to be hovering slightly above and behind my next door neighbor's home.  The object reflected the late afternoon orange glow. The sky was clear that evening.  At first I thought it may be a globe commonly seen hanging on power lines, but then realized there were no power lines in that area.  I could see no means of flight and there was absolutely no sound coming from the object.  I thought it was about 500 ft above the ground and I could see some details.  It appeared to be a small object about 4-6 ft in diameter.  The object appeared to gently sway as if impacted by a breeze, of which there was very little.  It eventually drifted away to the Southwest and out of sight. I went inside and got my camera and took almost 3 dz photos.  Also during the observation, I picked up my video camera and took about 12 min of video of the object toward the end of my sighting.  I observed the object for about 45 min in total (according to the time and date stamps on my photos).  I had to move my position to a different part of my backyard in order to continue to track the object as it drifted away. Finally it became too dark to track.  Also I forgot to take my video camera out of auto focus, so as it got darker and the leaves of the trees moved, the object appears to go in and out of focus.  That was my error. The first 2-3 min were observed without equipment.  Then I secured my camera(s) for the remainder of the time.  When I put the photos on my computer I could see more detail and noted 3 antenna or rods attached to the object.  There is an airport a few miles away and airplanes were flying in the background, but none came near or even close to the object.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
4 metallic spheres spotted hovering near Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego.;2014-10-23 17:25:00;15-20 seconds;4 metallic spheres spotted hovering near Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego Four metallic looking spheres were witnessed hovering approx 400 meters off the ground.   Objects were 7-10 meters in diameter, all the same size, in a single line pattern evenly spaced approx 50 meters apart.  No lights or sounds could be seen or heard.  Objects hovered in place and were observed for 45-60 seconds and when I looked down and looked back up, they were gone. Objects were seen from Allied Gardens area of San Diego and were approximated to be located near Qualcomm Stadium/ Mission Valley area.  I was driving west along Waring Road just off I-8 freeway.  Objects appeared to be approx 3-5 miles away.  I was alone, and on my way home after picking up my toddler from daycare and thought it strange to see two hot air balloons in this area, but then looked down and back up and saw a third and then a fourth.  Objects appeared grey, but then shined in sunlight looking metallic.  Objects did not move.   There were other commercial airplanes in the area.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Steady light traveling at a high velocity across the southern dark morning sky.;2016-01-25 05:45:00;30 seconds;Steady light travelling at a high velocity across the southern dark morning sky. At 5:45 a.m., I went outside to observe the alignment of the 5 naked eye planets.  After spotting Jupiter furthest west in the southwest sky, I observed a round object with the same brightness of Jupiter (not as bright as Venus) travelling at a steady but fast rate in front of the background stars.   Because the sun was not up I could not tell if the object was in our atmosphere although it was not severely refracting light as it would if it wasn't.  It appeared to be at a very high altitude and was travelling at a velocity inconsistent with the speed of commercial jets.  The moving sphere was round and looked like a planet.   I ran to my daughter's room so she could witness it too by the time we returned (15 seconds at most it was gone).  That time period would not have been long enough for object to breach the horizon.  My best explanation is that it was a high altitude military aircraft or a satellite reflecting the rising sun.

I noticed a dim red light around near where the horizon should have been sitting fairly still.  It then began to brighten and move around in an irregular pattern, almost like looking at the random flight path of a fly.   I ask my girlfriend if she is seeing the same thing I am and she confirms I am not seeing things.  We then spent the next 10 or so minutes watching this object brighten and dim while moving back and forth, gaining and losing altitude erratically.  The object was out over the pitch black ocean so I could not actually see the horizon so I could not determine how far away the object was.  There was no sound associated with the object.  I figure if the object was as close as two miles, its movements probably covered 0-1500ft in altitude and back and forth across the horizon a minimum of 3 miles.  It dimmed out once about 4 minutes in and appeared to be gone but came back about 3! 0 seconds after.  After it disappeared the second time I did not see it return and we left the location.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

All 10 appeared to be connected, as if there was a tether, because the distances and directions from each other didn't vary although a small perceive drift was noted of the entire group.  It almost appeared as though these were small silver balloons connect by string.  They were loosely arranged in a line, but poorly so.   I watched for three minutes and had to enter a building for work and upon return 1 minute later they were nowhere to be found.  That's where the silvery-chrome balloon theory fell apart.  Amazing.

It suddenly shot straight up at incredible speed for a distance, and stopped in a second like it had not just been moving at such a high rate of speed. It remained there for 5 minutes without moving. It then shot right back down to the original place it had been...again at incredible, instantaneous speed.  When it darted up a short distance, and when it darted back down after the 5 minutes, it left behind a short, vertical trail of something that quickly disappeared. It remained in position without moving at all for another few minutes. Then it shot off horizontally at a speed that seemed impossible, until it was out of sight. Once again, it left behind a short trail of something as it shot off almost too fast to keep track of visually. The trail substance quickly dissipated.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
