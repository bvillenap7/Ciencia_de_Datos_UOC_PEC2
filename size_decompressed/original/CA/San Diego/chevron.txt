I was standing in my backyard, just past twilight, stargazing, when I noticed a large chevron shaped formation of lights, traveling from East to West at 30,000 or so feet and at a speed in excess of Mach 2.   I'll preface the above statement by the fact I live near a military airbase and see many aircraft daily. However, this aircraft was not flying and/or adhering to any of the air traffic patterns or speeds I was accustomed to.   I will also add that the pattern of lights (they were white)I mentioned, which seemingly defined the object(s) leading edge, did not blink or even appear to twinkle due to any atmospheric distortion (it was a very clear night though).  Furthermore, I never heard a sound. In summary, what I saw is the first and only thing I've ever seen in flight, in thirty plus years, that I can say without hesitation, I don't know what it was.  In fact, I only came across this site trying to find some information for a friend who is interested in UFOs.   And, what led me to doing this posting is that in looking through the data, out of curiosity I looked back to 1994 to see if anyone had posted a sighting similar to mine.   Well, lo and behold, I found a Riverside, CA, event on 10/11/94 in which the description of the object (chevron), with the farmost lights from center offset a bit) matches what I saw in 8/94 in San Diego, perfectly.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Lights changed position as it went out of view over eastern horizon. It really went fast. No noise. I was sitting on my back patio which faces west. Looking up into the very clear sky (we are having Santa Ana's today) Dim lights in a boomerang shape flew right over my house. It seemed to be very high. I would guess 10,000 feet or so. I stood to watch it fly in an easterly direction. It flew straight. As it flew east it appeared that the lights changed positions and reformed in another boomerang shape before it went over the horizon. There was no sound. At first I thought it might be something from Miramar ( the air base near our home - about 8 miles south of us) but it was going too fast for any kind of airplanes. The lights seemed to be very dim - almost like a reflection. It was actually very graceful looking. It went extremely fast.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
In Mission Valley: Black V-shaped object with faint glowing dots like stars on undersurface;2002-12-06 22:30:00;1 minute;In Mission Valley: Black V-shaped object with faint glowing dots like stars on undersurface Mission Valley.  Almost impercetible motion caught my attention in night sky, once I focused on it it was clearly a black V-shaped object, black with no lights but with faint dots on it that looked almost like stars painted with glow-in-the-dark paint.  Rest of object was completely black and very hard to see unless you were looking right at it.   It was moving at a good clip with no wind.  No noise whatsoever.  Flew in a straight line from northwest toward southeast, disappeared over buildings within a minute.  Difficult to estimate size or distance due to dark color and no scale of reference.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
4 sphere red chevron;2003-11-23 21:15:00;3 seconds;4 sphere red chevron i am a 36 year old architect in san diego, as well as an amatuer astronomer.  i took several college-level chemistry, physics and mathematics courses  when i was in the chemical engineering program.  my wife and i arrived home from the airport about 9:00 sunday night (11/23/03).  i walked out to my truck to grab a cigarette, and walked around to the backyard with the dog.  it was rather chilly for southern california, and the skies were beautifully clear.  cassiopea was directly over head, as was andromeda, and orion was fully above the eastern horizon.  as i was looking directly overhead a flying chevron of reddish lights flew across my field of view, heading in a perfect south to north direction.  they were completely steady in their apparent magnitude, and did not blink or change color.  i believe there were 4 such objects, flying in what looked to have been a 5-point chevron formation that was missing one point on it's extreme limb.  the size of the grouping was about the size of the full moon, or maybe one's fist at arm's length.  despite the clear night, the extent of san diego's light pollution prevented me from determining if the shape defined by the points of lights blocked out the stars behind it, but my feeling was that they were distinct and separate objects.  the grouping moved incredibly fast, travelling from directly overhead to beyond my neighbor's house to the north in no more than 3 seconds.  as the formation approached a point near my neighbor's tall palm tree, it very rapidly faded from sight as if passing throught the earth's shadow, similar to many satellites i have observed in the past.  the formation glided along on a perfect and absolutley silent path, also very much like a satellite in low earth orbit.  a couple of seconds later a passenger jet making it's final approach to Lindberg Field passed through the same area of sky, although this was travelling east to west, and making all the noises one would expect to hear from a low-flying jet just several miles from it's target runway.  my initial thoughts were that due to it's south-north axis of travel, total silence and apparent encounter with the earth's shadow, i was viewing a series of military satellites flying in a constellation formation, or perhaps a NOSS satellite.  what disturbs me, however, are serveral inconsitent items:  1.  the ruddy objects did not appear as points of light, but rather as very distinct spheres with a measurable diameter.  if the objects were indeed in low earth orbit, they must have been incredibly large, several times each the size of the ISS (Int'l Space Station). if it was not a group of objects but one single object, the size of the object would be measured in miles, and not in feet.  i have seen the ISS several times, and it never appeared more than a very bright star.  2. if it was a satellite, there should be no reason for it (them) to be the color red.  we see satellites because they reflect white sunlight off of their metal chassis or solar arrays.  the quality of light also did not seem to have the quality of reflected (speculative)light.  3.  the velocity of the object(s) seemed to be incompatable with the speed of other objects in low earth orbit.  it moved much too fast to maintain an orbit about the earth - it seemed it would rather be flung out of the pull of earth's gravity.  4. if #3 is true, that means the object(s) were probably flying very low overhead and withoug making any noise!  if they were not in low earth orbit, then they could not have disappeared because of entering the earth's shadow, but instead disappeared through some other means.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Lights (red, blue, green, white) that changed color and direction without any noticable pattern, object moved left and right.;2009-11-27 18:00:00;20min.;Lights (red, blue, green, white) that changed color and direction without any noticable pattern, object moved left and right. Sighted lights that over south San Diego that changed color between red, blue, green, and white. The lights sometimes went from the center of the object and radiated outward, other times from the tips inward. It appeard to fade from view every couple of minutes then appear again. It would sometimes flash the lights in sequences but no discernable repition was viewed. The lights were not arranged in any pattern that one would expect to see on any U.S. registered aircraft, nor did they have the correct colors or sequences. It did not move like any aircraft I have ever seen. The object floated in one spot then would move one direction in a slow but steady manner and reverse direction, almost impreceptably but very definitlety. After about 20min it descended in at a steady rate that appeared to be very controlled. Before it faded from view it changed direction in the same fashion it did previously but to a smaller degree then flashed a very bright red/white righ! t before disappearing from view.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Chevron-shaped craft spotted passing over California interstate;2010-04-10 17:30:00;1 minute;Chevron-shaped craft spotted passing over California interstate While driving south bound on CA I-5 my wife spotted a chevron-shaped aircraft slowly passing overhead. The craft resembled a B-2, but it emitted absolutely no sound, not even the low sound of a landing stealth airplane or jet. The aircraft was not flying parallel to the earth, but at a 45 degree angle or steeper, and its trajectory was parallel to the earth. The sighting occurred between the Sea World exit and the I-8 exit on I-5 at 1730 PST or GMT-8. I turned in the passenger seat to see if I could catch a glimpse of it through the back window of the car. I could see the aircraft silhouetted against the sky for several seconds before the aircraft vanished in an instant. There were other commercial aircraft in the vicinity due to the proximity to the SD international airport, but the chevron was definitely not commercial. There are also several military installations in the area, but these are home to only C-130, F-18, CH-46, and CH-53E squadrons.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Red Chevron shaped light floating South with long light trails behind it;2011-04-14 21:30:00;1 minute;Red Chevron shaped light floating South with long light trails behind it I went onto our deck, which over looks the Pacific Ocean, and something in the starry night sky caught my eye, it was so startling I yelled to my partner to come quick.  It was a large red light moving quickly with long light trails behind it, then it vanished and then came back for a second and was gone.  It lasted less than a minute.  However it was already floating proud when I had come outside and noticed it.  Amazing. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 21:24 hrs. (Pacific).

Low, fast moving craft over San Diego, California, with 4 dimly lit lights which were in the shape of a chevron.;2015-11-05 18:05:00;5 seconds;Low, fast moving craft over San Diego, California with 4 dimly lite lights which were in the shape of a chevron I was smoking outside at the corner of West Lewis and Falcon Streets in San Diego at 6:05pm this evening, Thursday, November 5, 2015.  l was looking almost straight up and saw a very low set of 4 dim lights coming from the NW and heading SE.  There was a lead light with 2 lights on the right and 1 light on the left.   These evenly spaced lights formed a chevron.  These lights were very dim.  They were yellow white in color.  I could see there was a solid craft in between the lights and behind the lights but the lights were too dim to illuminate the outer edges of the craft, so I can't really say what exactly the shape of the craft was.  I can only say for sure that there was a solid craft in between and behind the lights.   The craft was partially illuminated by the dim yellow white lights, but also from the city lights.  This craft was very low.  It must have been under 500 feet.  I first saw it in the NW.  It flew almost directly over me maybe at 85 degrees, at its closest point.  It was completely silent.  It was moving fast.  I first saw it just coming from the NW and it was going out of view being blocked by houses within 4 or 5 seconds.   There were other aircraft visible on the horizon but this area of the sighting is near the San Diego airport, so there are almost always aircraft in the horizon.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Silent craft flies over San Diego.;2015-11-10 17:00:00;3 seconds;Silent craft flies over San Diego. Flying at low speed, silently.  Was roughly 500-600 feet in the sky just above or at cloud level.   Looked as though it was only being seen due to the reflection of light from the street lights.   Small shooting stars were seen coming from the east to west, as the craft traveled north to south.
