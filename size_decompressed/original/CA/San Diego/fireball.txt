a fast moving, green-white, glowing object streaked across the sky. It moved southward as I drove south along I-5.;1998-11-15 00:15:00;1 second;a fast moving, green-white, glowing object streaked across the sky. It moved southward as I drove south along I-5. Basically this was a glowing green-white fireball. It moved very fast. It could be dismissed as a flare of some type, but it seemed to move much faster and was larger. It was at about a 70 degrees in the sky... nearly directly above me but still withing my field of vision through my windshield. I do not beleive it was a flare or firework because the fireball was much wider than a flare and seemd to move southward and downward...whereas flares and fireworks would not go down. I was driving through Camp Pendleton on the freeway. It is a very dark area along the freeway, which was relatively empty for Southern California. The object streaked leaving a trail...like it was a glowing green-white comet. Perhaps it was an early arrival of the Leonids.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Brilliant orange/gold fireball moving EXTREMELY slowly - almost inperseptably at first, west to east, with a trail, for about 45 second;1999-02-10 23:40:00;45 seconds;Brilliant orange/gold fireball moving EXTREMELY slowly - almost inperseptably at first, west to east, with a trail, for about 45 seconds, then vanished. It made no sound. On February 10, 1999 at 11:40pm I was leaving my friends' apartment buliding in the Peñesquitos area of San Diego near I-15, walking east in the parking lot toward my car. It was a crystal clear night with no clouds, and excellent visibility of the stars. My intuition told me to turn around as I walked through the parking lot, and there directly over my friends' apartment building was a large, brilliant, orangish gold fireball, seemingly hovering. As I watched, I realized it was moving -- albeit very slowly -- from west to east. It had a trail of what I would describe as 'sparks'. It took about 45 seconds to go from over the apartment building to over the parking lot... an incredibly long period of time for something 'flying in the sky' to go such a short distance... at which time it was directly overhead and simply vanished. It made no sound. I have seen many many meteors over the years, and am a seasoned star-watcher. I have never, ever seen anything like this and it left me in awe and in wonder. It was extarordinary.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
At 10:45 in the morning, my father and I noticed a small stationary object in the sky.;1999-10-10 11:00:00;1 hour;At 10:45 in the morning, my father and I noticed a small stationary object in the sky. I currently reside in Mira Mesa, which is located about 10 miles north of downtown San Diego.  The house was getting warm so my father and I went out into the back-yard to sit in the shade. My chair was facing northwest while my father was facing notheast.  As we talked, my father mentioned that he was watching an object in the sky that was apparently not moving. Getting curious, I shifted my chair and after a little searching located the object.  I estimate the object's position to be northeast and about 45 degrees above the horizon.  The sky was clear and bright with the point of light, looking to be a few miles away. I noted the time (10:45)and after a few minutes my father again remarked that the object still hadn't moved.  I relocated the object, using the peak of a neighbor's rooftop as a reference point.  Indeed, the object was still there and I went inside to get my 7X50 binoculars.  Using the same reference point, I relocated the object.  Bringing the binoculars into focus, revealed the small object to have an oval shape and glowing a bright orange.  It was now a few minutes after 11:00 and the object had still not noticibly moved.  I watched the object through the binoculars for a few more minutes and saw that featureless orange glow was not varying in brightness.  Asking my father to keep an eye on the object, I went inside to get some stronger optics.  After a few minutes, I came outside with video camera that has a 50X digital zoom. Unfortunately, without a tripod the camera shook too much to be of any use.  The time was by then 11:30 and while continuing to watch the object through my 7X50's, I noticed that it began moving slowly away. The object's heading was due east and in only a couple of minutes, it was gone from sight.  At no time during this sighting, did either myself or my father notice any sign of a contrail. I must note that my house is located less than two miles from the U.S.Marine Corps Air Station at Miramar.  I have seen and heard all manner of aircraft over the years and this object really made an impression me.  Because the object was apparently quite far away and high in the sky, I hope that there were other witnesses to this event.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

It drifted across the sky (about an arm's length distance) and sat in the same spot for about 5 more minutes. All of a sudden it started to dim and come back brighter, then about 2 minutes later it went dark all together, came back instantly with a bright white flash and then disappeared again leaving 4 small dusty objects that also disappeared within 1-2 seconds.

Object came from the northwest.  It was a floating, orange roundish shape that moved in a slow, serpentine pattern toward the southeast.

When it got closer to the moon it appeared more like a spacecraft.  There was no audible sound from the craft.  We couldn't see it after that.

Orange Light in the Sky  Pacific Beach;2003-04-27 22:20:00;10 min;Orange Light in the Sky  Pacific Beach I was driving down the road in San Diego, CA on Garnet avenue in the Pacific Beach Area.  Having a convertable I tend to see more stuff going on then the regular vehicle.  I looked up as I was coming down the hill and saw the strangest Orange Light in the sky.  As I came to the stop light I looked almost striaght up at it.  It was directly above my car probably the same height as commercial airliners.  I noticed it was moving slightly in a circle and kept pulsating an Orange Glow.  I kept looking at it but it didn't move like any kind of air craft, it almost hovered.  I called up my buddy down the street he live on Ingraham St.  He jumped outside and was tripping on what he was seeing as well.  He continued to watch it and said it just eventually faded out after about 10 minutes of viewing it.  It was an amazing and unexplainable sighting.  If anyone in the San Diego area saw this tell us about it.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

A flame floating through the sky moved slowly and closely above us before departing into space as a small red light.;2006-04-23 20:30:00;3-4 minutes;A flame floating through the sky moved slowly and closely above us before departing into space as a small red light. A flame that was moving from west to east was coming toward our position, directly overhead.  It was moving slowly, and seemed to be approaching us.  At one point, we asked each other if it was falling from directly above us, down toward us.   It was very large (looked like the fire that comes out of a hot air balloon but bigger) and slowly floated above us, in the same west-east direction.  It looked like it could have been only 100 meters above ground at the closest point.   It then gradually moved away from us, getting smaller and smaller, as if it was moving further from the Earth as it moved eastward.  This continued until it turned into a small red light and disappeared.  The red light at the very end looked like a small red star.   By the end we were not looking as easterly as we were looking up at the sky.  From our vantage point it seemed to move very slowly while it approached us (like a hot air balloon) and very quickly as it moved away from us (like a jet or rocket).  Nothing we could imagine could seem to be so close, and in just a matter of seconds be so far away.   The entire episode lasted 3-4 minutes, most of which was time it spent approaching and floating above us, always moving in the west-east direction.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

However, they were falling too slowly for fireworks.  It almost looked like 2 small comets with tails.  Suddenly, they merged into one for about 15 seconds. They separated again, but with one remaining stationary in the sky as a round ball and the other still slowly falling like a slow comet.  After the comet was a bit below the ball, the comet stopped as well and became a hovering ball. The first ball, (farther up in the sky) disappeared into thin air.  About 3 seconds later the other one turned back into a comet and fell beyond our line of sight.

A bright white fireball in the N about 1k high, fell to the NE it was about to hit houses and vanished, lasted15 secs.;2009-02-05 17:24:00;10-15 Seconds;A bright white fireball in the N about 1k high, fell to the NE it was about to hit houses and vanished, lasted15 secs. On February 5, 2009.  5:24 P.M. I was standing outside on the porch enjoying the fresh air. I was looking to the north when I saw a large ball of fire.  It really startled me because it didn't look like it could be more then 1,000 feet high in the sky. Looking directly at it the size might have been the size of 2 basketballs put together.  I used my neighbors roof peak to give the fall a direction.  If the peak of their roof was 12 o'clock the fireball fell to 3:30 in 10-15 seconds.  I ran from the porch to the sidewalk.  Just when I thought it was going to crash into the houses about 1/2 block north of where I was standing it went poof and was gone.  By poof I mean that it got dim and just disappeared.  It didn’t shatter or fall apart, it just got dim and was gone. The fireball itself was a bright white and the flames around the outside were neon lime green closest to the circumference then neon yellow and finally a very bright orange.  (The orange wasn't as intense as the other colors.)   I have never seen anything burn with those colors, as you are familiar with flame at the orifice of a gas burner it is the hottest at the very brightest blue, the gets cooler as you move away.

burning fireball in sky mistook for moon!;2009-08-27 22:00:00;2 mins;burning fireball in sky mistook for moon! Last night my girlfriend and I came home from dinner and we went outside to have a cigarette.  Right as I stepped outside I looked to the lower northern sky and noticed something very piculiar! at first I thought i was looking at the moon due to the shape and size that it normally would have been.  But it looked to be glowing or burning?  The first thing I said to my girlfriend was,  Hey, look at the moon, it looks like it's on fire!  She turned around, and we both looked in amazment as the burning sphere in the sky shifted its light source within itself.  At first the entire object was a red/maroon color. over the next two minutes the object seemed to transform the light within, shifting it downward and then upward within the sphere. After a few minutes the object dropped in the sky and we could see it through some trees approx. 3 miles from us.  After that it seemed to fade away and disapear. So, am I crazy or did anyone else see what my girlfriend and I know we saw?   Very interested in knowing!!;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Directions changed once again, from South-West to North, gaining both altitude and speed.

They looked like orange, circular  balls of light and they seemed to come in groups of 3 at a time where they semi-shifted course in the sky, became close together, then seemed to dissapate...when the next group of 2-3 would make their way across the sky in a line-fashion, shift direction, come close together, then dissipate.   They were  definitely NOT flares in the sky. Not sure what we witnessed tonight, but never seen anything like it before.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Two round orange lights hovering over south San Diego.;2013-10-30 03:20:00;3 minutes;Two round orange lights hovering over south San Diego. I was leaving work with my co worker and we looked up and saw 2 orange lights slowly hovering in the distance at first they looked close to each other then one light moved away and dimmed eventually disapearing.   As we walked towards our car  a building got between our line of sight and the second object when we came around it was gone.  The light from the object was orange almost like fireball but it wasn't moving like a plane or helicopter.   I always leave around the same time and there has never been anything flying in that area of the sky.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Fireballs over San Diego.;2013-12-30 18:30:00;5-10 minutes;Fireballs over San Diego. On December 30, 2013, between 6 & 7 pm, I was getting off the 163 freeway at the Genesee Exit in San Diego.   I looked to the east and saw what in my mind was an airplane on fire.  I saw some lights but and what I thought was an engine on fire on the plane.  It was glowing bright orange and it just seemed too big to be what we thought we were seeing.    My mother and I watched as the “engine” fell off, and I thought there was going to be a plane crash.  Instead, the bright orange fireball just seemed to stop and then broke into three bright glowing orange fireballs.   We drove several minutes trying to keep them above the tree line so we could see them.   Finally, after what seemed to be more than 5 minutes since we first saw the glowing fireball, we were unable to see them above the tree line.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Looked like the flash of fire wold repeat slowly moving each time the engines fired.  Probably 6-10 times a second leaving a visible separate fire ball trail.  Then it would go black for a few seconds and fire off 6-10 more times.  It lasted for 30-60 seconds.  I was speaking on my cell phone on my apartment balcony with my girlfriend looking out over Mission Valley when I noticed it.  At first I thought it was fireworks but it was moving slowly in a Northeastern direction.  I told my girlfriend who laughed at me and then I told her I needed to hang up the phone to video it.  By the time I hit record the ufo had been gone for maybe 5-0 seconds.  I just missed it.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Fireball moving south to north in western sky lasting about 15 minutes, faded from sight in the distance.;2017-01-15 22:00:00;15-20 minutes;Fireball moving south to north in western sky lasting about 15 minutes, faded from sight in the distance. At first I thought the fireball might be a meteor or an aircraft on fire.  It moved slowly south to north across the western sky.   When I first saw the fireball several small fireballs dropped and burned out as they fell.  This led me to believe it may be an aircraft that was burning, it dropped one last small fireball that burned-out, then it continued north across the sky moving at a pace similar to a plane in the distance, until it faded from sight.

My wife, roommate, and myself noticed 4-5 reddish fireballs in the southwest skies of San Diego.  It looked like it was just a little off the coast.   The fireballs were in a triangle formation and they were not moving.  We watched for about 10 minutes and they eventually disappeared...like they just burnt out and were gone.  I saw the exact same thing 1 year before.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
2 Strange bright zig zagging lights in San Diego sky on 02/01/18 at 1840 hours.;2018-02-01 18:40:00;1 minute;2 Strange bright zig zagging lights in San Diego sky on 02/01/18 at 1840 hours. My wife daughter and I saw 2 lights in the sky that appeared to have tails.  They were light orange in color, very bright and at first they were stationary then they moved in a slow downward zig zag motion.  I have a bad picture of it and a five second video, that is very poor.  Be advised that the lights were observed from my house as I was looking East.  We live approximately 5-10 miles from Brown Field Airport in San Diego and I did leave a message with them hoping they have an answer.  The Airport is small.  Please let me know if anyone else saw this and if there's an explanation.   Thank you.  ((e-address deleted));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

meteor or space junk?;2020-01-29 20:10:00;2 seconds;Meteor or space junk?  There have been several articles on the internet about a possible sighting of a fireball or space junk seen over San Diego county and Los Angeles county after 10:00pm on Wednesday night 29 January 2020.  I live in San Diego.  I did not see the event after 10:00pm but I thought i would mention there was an earlier event around 8:10pm the same night.  It also was either a large meteor or space junk?  The street I live on runs north-south.  As I was walking south a large meteor was seen while looking down the street to the south?  I didnt think much about it butI did have the thought that it seemed to be coming down slower than most meteors. I know the approxiate time because I texted my Dad at 8:17pm that I had juist seen a meteor.  Anyway, thought I would mention this.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

White bright light coming from ball and then floated away;2020-09-20 23:00:00;Minutes;White bright light coming from ball and then floated away Last night I fell asleep with my bedroom window open.  My neighbor has a loud screeching bird that woke me around 10:30-11pm.  So I closed my bedroom window.  After I closed and locked it, there was a bright light coming into my room.  Like a helicopter was shining it’s light right into my window.  So I got back up to look.  When I peeked through the blind, there was a white light the size of a basket ball in the air heading towards my neighbors house.  I could not see it once it passed my neighbors house.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
