Intense overhead close noise shaking the earth This was my second experience with this type phenomena.  I was working in my office around midnight and heard what I thought was a huge storm approaching.  Thunder, lightning, wind - - yet when I looked out all was quiet and the stars and moon visible.  I am usually terrified of thunderstorms, yet when this came near I felt a sort of excitement.  I went into the yard and the sky was totally black above me (as it had been in an earlier experience at noon some months before.  I stood in the yard with this blackness above and lightning flashing to earth in a circle around me.  The wind was terrific winding my cafton about me like the streamers on a maypole.  The sound was deafening, a steady roar.  The thought in my mind was of a movie I had seen years before where a mother had drawn a circle upon the floor and sat, with her son, huddled within it while something like this was happening.  I thought about drawing a circle in the grass, but did not.  I felt amazement at my feeling of joy when by all rights I should be scared out of my wits.  I stood there and raised my arms.  The next morning I awoke on the daybed in my office.   At breakfast I casually said to my husband That was some storm we had last night, was it not  He said that he had not heard anything. I was leaving for the week so did not ask anyone else about the storm. The following week when I returned home my husband wanted to talk about the storm, but I felt a strong need to deny that it happened.  He said that when he went over to town (2 miles away)that the people were asking him what had been going on at our home in the night.  That the whole town was shaking and people were rushing outside and from their location they could look across at our home where something huge was over our house.  (We are located on the second ridge with a deep valley between giving visibility.)   He also said that our neighbor up the hill from us had come wanting to know what had been happening.  She said that in the night their house had lifted from its foundation and shook like it was falling apart.  The children were all screaming over the roaring sound and the family fled outdoors convinced that the world was coming to an end.  It was an old rural area with but few houses.  For Sale signs went up quite promptly and the people moved away.  The bulldozers came in scraping off the signs of habitation and a new subdivision began.  I have often wished I could relocate some of these people to get a description of what they saw over our house from a distance.  In neither case did I see anything. In the earlier case at noon on a bright sunny day it suddenly became eerily dark with the wind and roaring.  That lasted about four seconds before everything clicked back to normal again.  The night experience was similar in that the moon and stars disappeared while the noise and wind continued.  I do not know how long that lasted.  My viewing of it was probably as long as a minute and a half.  That was the length of my memory or the happening.  Obviously to arouse a town of people plus my neighbors and get them out of their home in the middle of the night it must have lasted somewhat longer.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Something very large and silent passed overhead - heard but not seen.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly the sound of wing vortices.  PD));1974-01-30 23:00:00;10 seconds;Something very large and silent passed overhead - heard but not seen. January or February 1974.  I did not see a craft, but certainly heard something.  I was attending school at the Naval Training Center (NTC) in San Diego.  I had seen a movie (The Neptune Factor) and was walking back to the barracks.   Passing through a parking lot, I heard a tremendous sound - imagine something the size of a 747 passing 100 feet overhead with its engines shut down.  It was not the wind...  I have spent quite a bit of time outdoors and know it was not something like that.  Being a glider pilot, I know the sound that aircraft make when they fly without power - and it was almost like that, but 100x louder than any sailplane.  When this happened, I stopped and looked up.  Unfortunately, there were bright lights in the parking lot and I could not see if the stars were obscured.  NTC is directly in the flight path of Lindberg Field.  But if this was an airliner gliding to a landing at the airport, it never would've made it.  I thought perhaps I was hearing things, until I looked across the parking lot and saw another sailor, standing still and looking straight up.  I walked over to him, and he asked me, What the hell was THAT?  I asked him what happened, and he described back to me exactly what I experienced. ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the source of this report for his having submitted such a excellent rendition of what he experienced aurally.  We wonder whether he might have been aural witness to the vortices, which are generated in the atmosphere at the wing tips of aircraft.  They descend to the surface, seconds or minutes after an airliner has passed, and they are very audible, as they twist at high speed.  Given that the witness was close to Lindberg Field makesus wonder about this this possibility.  The phenomenon is very common, close to airports where heavy aircraft are landing.

Shiny object was high above and traveled at high rate of speed. (faster than a commercial airplane) When directly above, gave off a bright flash. Without loosing momentum the object split into eight equal size objects and traveled in opposite directions at same speed as initial object. Almost as if dividing the sky into slices. Objects to high for me to see a clear shape. At first thought it was a jet because of the stainless steel like sheen (chrome like) but noticed it gave off no sound. At first thought it had exploded but then realized the pieces kept going until disappearing over the horizon. It was a warm day, the sky was clear, no clouds. I was thirteen years old, coming home from school and threw my backpack over the fence to my back yard when I looked up and noticed object. Never seen anything like it since.

signals are returned from space hours or days later;2001-09-09 15:00:00;few seconds;signals are returned from space hours or days later In august of 2001 i heard on Coast to Coast am radio show that an answer to SETI and an alien face had been transmitted into a crop field in England.  I found this interesting and decided to transmit signals using my 2 meter ham radio (ten watts) and a cubical quad beam antenna to see what would happen.   I was transmitting for several nights on 146.520 FM (national calling frequency). I would transmit a series of mike cliks while aiming the antenna about 50 degrees off the horizon pointed at the south southeast direction.  This antenna was mounted on the roof of my van and i was doing this nightly from about 2am to about 4am.  I was also transmitting the audio from a digital timex 1000 program (sounds like a bunch of bees).  Then one afternoon around 3pm I was dialing in Michael savage out of san francisco on my radio shack shortwave radio. Suddenly the series of cliks i was transmitting around 3am in the morning were heard in the shortwave receiver.  The receiver was sitting next to the transmission cable leading to the cubical quad beam antenna on the van's roof.  I figure it inducted the signal into the small portable radio receiver. I was not able to figure from which night the signals were returned as I had been doing this for several nights. If it was from the night before it would have been about a 12 hour round trip if from 2 nights before it would have been a 36 hour round trip and so on. Then 9-11 happened and since I was sitting across the bay from Naval Air Station North Island coronado I decided to take the antenna off the roof so as not to be consider spying or anything as that.  So this is one more mystery in my life that I have not figured out.  I invite anyone to try this as right now the window is open up to about sept 11.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

It got boring after a while. a couple minutes later i turn back and the object was turning, going the other way. This continued about 7 times. the UFO was going around in a circle about 7 or 8 times and it could have been the air force but I think it is very unusual for something go to in the air 7 times in the same area.

12-15 red lights over the Pacific (many miles out) changing formation, but NOT moving, and very distinct from our beach condo;2005-06-07 22:00:00;15 min;12-15 red lights over the Pacific (many miles out) changing formation, but NOT moving, and very distinct from our beach condo We were staying at a condo on Mission Beach, San Diego on the 3rd floor.  My husband saw the lights first.  They were in the shape of a triangle at first, then the lights would change shape. He called us all over after he saw them in the triangle formation.  The lights were red and were far out in the Pacific Ocean.  I thought it was a mast of a ship or large naval ship but everyone else thought they were too high above the horizon line to be a ship.  The lights didn't move.  It was like there was a string of lights and certain  ones would turn off while other ones would turn on.  At one point it looked like the outline of a bow of a ship sinking into the ocean but it would have to have been a ship about 800 feet tall and 400 feet long for it to have been as visible as it was to us.  There  were probably 12 to 15 lights total.  After watching them  for about 15 minutes, they reduced down to 3 in a triangle formation and then they just went off.  Were not sure if it was one big object with lights on it or if it was several individual lights/objects.  I (only me) am still not convinced it was not a ship of some sort.  We turned on the news but could find no coverage of the event. Not being from the area, we didn't know if it was some kind of practice for the 4th of July lighted boat harbor event.  Definitely not fireworks  or flares, though.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

First it fell like a shooting star, then it began to jig jag... I was standing outside with two friends atop a higher hilly region a few miles off of Del Mar Heights Road in the Del Mar area of San Diego (more inland about 5-7 miles East of the 5 Freeway).  We had all just finished admiring the panoramic view and the various skylines when something drew my eyes back to that part of the sky. All of a sudden, I saw what appeared to be a very low shooting star way off in the distance. It is hard to decipher where it was exactly in San Diego, as it seemed to be over 10 - 20 miles south / southeast of where we were. Immediately, I told the others and they watched what initially appeared to be a shooting star begin to rise back up in the sky. I found myself saying, Wait a minute, that's not supposed to happen.  That's not a shooting star afterall.   The object was glowing red and green and was hard to identify the shape.  Instead of dissipating into the atmosphere after it fell, it began to move close to the ground next to a few tall buildings (5 - 10 stories in height).  It then moved back up in a jig jagged way.  It went about 5 stories above the taller buildings and then swooped back down near the ground again. We all looked away as we joked at what it could be.  Hopefully it's just a very nicely made remote control toy or something.  But then I realized it had impressively bright lights.  We all looked back a third time to see if it was still there, and found it was very high up in the sky - about as high or even higher than a commercial airplane flies.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Two dark objects less than two miles away, moving east then separating and accelerating north at a miraculous rate of speed.;2014-01-01 18:46:00;45 seconds;Two dark objects less than two miles away, moving east then separating and accelerating north at a miraculous rate of speed. I was on my balcony looking west from Rancho Bernardo California, toward the hills above the neighborhood called Westwood, separating North County East from North County West and the Coast. Something caught my eye as flying toward me below the horizon of the hill. Being after dark, I first thought it was an unusually large bird with white tipped wings, but they began to glide north and moved above the horizon, one object began moving ahead and bit faster than the other. With the light of the horizon I began to get my depth of field and could see the two objects were moving north at an extremely fast rate of speed. They continued to remain between my location and the hills, so their distance was less than two miles away.  Their altitude continued to be much lower than the ceiling for the airplanes in the area. I have never seen a UFO before and there was no possible way these were airplanes or anything of earthly origin. They were not very large, but they were! not extremely small like the orbs occasionally described either. They were moving extremely smoothly and at a rate of speed even as they began to increase altitude, as if there was no resistance and the moved far faster than any aircraft we have and making no sound at all. Being so close, there should have been some sound. The movement was much more like gliding, only at an extremely high rate of speed. Just after the forward craft began to distance its self slightly from the craft in the rear, they both accelerated and disappeared heading north.  The light omitted from these craft was constant and white with no blinking or other coloration.  The craft themselves was dark or shadowy, and impossible to make out.  The lights were dimmer than I would have guessed from descriptions that I have heard of UFO sightings in the past and even compared to other aircraft in the area that were much higher and further away.  Due to the flight path of planes moving south from Los Angeles, th! ere were several airplanes in the area, although none in the direct pa th north, south or west of the craft.  The sighting lasted roughly 20-40 seconds.  I doubt very seriously that I was the only one to see these.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Before they disappeared they started shuffling from positions to positions and and then traveled higher in the sky.

With the Lindbergh airport to the north of the picture frame.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
One object, incredible speed, then blinked out suddenly.;2020-05-19 11:40:00;2 minutes;One object, incredible speed, then blinked out suddenly. While out walking my dog, I spotted an object/craft quite high in the NW sky.  It was light or silver in color, too high/far to be certain of its shape.  It shot across the sky, silent, with great speed heading East.  Too great to have been an airplane or other typical craft, covering an amazing distance almost instantly.  Then, it simply disappeared as if blinking out and was gone.  The weather was clear except for a few scattered clouds but non were anywhere near the object as I observed it.  The sky was mostly clear and blue with no haze or smog.  On April 28/2020 I saw/reported three objects in the same location, in a horizontal row that remained stationary then blinked out in an instant.

One stationary object, then great speed, then poof...simply gone!;2020-05-20 11:15:00;3 minutes;One stationary object, then great speed, then poof...simply gone! It was a 100% clear day with no clouds or haze whatsoever.  I saw one light or silver colored object in the NW sky, too high to determine the shape.  It was stationary and silent.  Suddenly, it darted with tremendous speed to the E, covering a great distance.  A second later, as I could still see it, it was poof...gone.  This is my third sighting in the same location since April 28, 2020.  Whatever these craft are, they can remain stationary, dart across the sky at great speeds, and blink out in an instant.  There is a Naval Military base NE. Could the craft be observing or monitoring it?  The objects/craft I've observed are silent.  The Naval Base planes can be easily heard although the base is miles away and their planes are too far to see as a rule. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from same source.

single file lights in the sky.  ((Starlink satellites??));2021-02-14 05:15:00;2 minutes;single file lights in the sky February 14, 2021  A little after 5 a.m. I was outside and looked up into the sky to see a row of slow moving lights, they seemed to be independent of one another and were not exactly lined up, some got closer to the one in front and then fell back into line (only slightly) and were traveling single file. I did not count them but I would say there were 15 or so, moving in an easterly direction, they were south of me and I can not say what elevation they were, though not nearly as far away as satellites are, more like the elevation of an airplane. Definitely not balloons as they were independently moving on their own power, and not part of a bigger craft. There was a single light the same color as the stars are. I watched them until they disappeared from view, the conditions were hazy over the coast, and they continued into the haze, but the sky above me was clear and that is why I saw them so clearly. I am in San Diego, on a point of land called point loma. There is a lot of military in this town and that could be what I saw, perhaps a fleet of drones being moved to north island naval air base.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
