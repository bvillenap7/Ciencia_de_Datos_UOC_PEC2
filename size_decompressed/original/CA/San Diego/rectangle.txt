I saw a ginormous, rectangular, metallic UFO in broad day light over the naval base.;1990-06-01 12:00:00;15 minutes;I saw a ginormous, rectangular, metallic UFO in broad day light over the naval base. It was a warm, sunny, and windy day on the bay in San Diego.  I was about 8 to 12 years old and my neighbor was 2 years my senior.  His father took us fishing at Shelter Island Pier which faces North Island Naval Complex to the southeast(according to google maps).  The pier was wooden at the time and has since been rebuilt but is more or less in the same spot perpendicular then parallel to its shoreline in a 'T'. I am unsure of the exact time of day, it was likely between 11am and 2pm.  I am unsure of the month but the time of year was likely spring or summer because of how high and bright the sun was that day.  This could have been a Saturday afternoon, spring break or summer vacation.  The year was anywhere from 1989 to 1993. I believe my friend's dad noticed the UFO first, to the north.  We were on the south end of the pier looking north to our left.  It was gray/ dull-metallic in color and looked like a flying cruise ship with no protrusions of any kind.  It was flat and thick as if many levels to it, but was rectangular.  It appeared to have ports on its side or perhaps markings.  The craft was so high up that finer details  of its side were blurry and I had 20/20 vision all through school-age.  It had no lights visible and made no noise which I remember finding strange, so I remembered the whole incident fairly well. I think the craft was in excess of 200yards long and thousands of feet high in altitude. If i hold my thumb up out in front of me, the craft appeared about 1-1.5inches wide by about 2/8 to 3/8inches thick and atleast 45 degrees above horizon. It moved very slowly for approximately 15 minutes, traveling north to south from our vantage point. It seemed to be high above North Island and Coronado.   In relation to all the other planes and blimps that were nearby at lower altitudes made the size of this craft very large and very high.  At the time many of these facts were pointed out by my friends dad, whom seemed to be astonished and in disbelief.   I knew both my neighbor and his father to be intelligent people and I have a background in science and medicine.  We discussed how incredibly awkward the craft was for about an hour with other fisherman after we lost sight of it.  It was fairly unspectacular because of its super slow speed and dull color.  It didn't seem to spin or turn or deviate from its southern route.  Someone speculated it could have held as many people as Star Trek's Enterprise-D if it were real.  We passed it off as a military craft because it was so visible to everyone, it didn't move erratically, it was in close proximity to the naval base, and it disappeared just as silently as it appeared.   To my knowledge no one has reported on this &quotmother ship&quot sighting.

rectangular space ship with large recessed lighting underneath  the space craft was hovering over the clouds moving in a circular motio;1994-07-25 00:30:00;SEA PORT VILLAGE;I was 17 and my girlfriend  who’s now my wife where at the south end of Sea port Village.  She was sitting down on the grass and I was lying on the grass with my head on her lap faced up looking at the sky.   The sky was partly cloudy, and as I was looking up at the sky, a rectangular space ship with large recessed lighting underneath the space craft was hovering over the clouds moving in a circular motion.   There lights where not on and the space craft appeared  to be carefully moving through the clouds.  I've only told a few people about what I saw that day, but I’m hoping to see if there more sighting like this that year.

I saw a big light  comeing twards us, then 2 more lights turned on on the sides, thies lights were like nothing I have ever seen because they were really bright and white.  Then it turned to their were 3 windows that were rectangular and about 4 lights underneath, as it started going away it stoped the lights under the craft turned red and blue then it shot of with out makeing a sound.  The reason I am reporting this now is because I saw a show on decovery and what they were showing kind of looked like what I saw.

bright white, fast-moving light seen over san diego;2008-11-28 22:00:00;2-3 seconds;bright white, fast-moving light seen over san diego My girlfriend and I were on our way home, exiting off of the 94 East, when we noticed a bright light in the Eastern sky. The lights were bright white, and the aircraft seemed to be a rectangular shape. The object 'fell' in an arching motion, and then quickly changed direction and took off FAST, where it disappeared. The object left a 'check-mark' shaped light trail, and disappeared in the vicinity of where it appeared. The duration of the sighting was only about two to three seconds, but we are both positive of what we saw. We recently moved to the San Diego area from Hawaii so my girlfriend could attend graduate school at the university. We have never witnessed anything like this, and just want to know if anyone else witnessed the same event.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Huge rectangular object seen over north San Diego.;2009-08-23 13:30:00;4 minutes;Huge rectangular object seen over north San Diego. Yesterday, Sunday, around 1:30 PM I was traveling east on highway 52, about 2 miles east of the 805 in San Diego and happened to look to the north.  Through my driver’s side window I observed a huge object in the sky.  I’d estimate it was at about 5,000 feet and  moving slowly in a northerly direction.  The amazing thing was how large it was and also the shape of it.  It was rectangular, just a little bit wider than high.  It seemed to have some kind of a band running around the center of it but was hard to make out the detail.  I took two quick shots with my cell phone camera.  The first one was off as I was driving and just trying to point and shoot.  The second one I got a shot of the object as it was almost touching the northern horizon and appeared pretty small by this time.  The shocking thing was the size and shape of it.  I was initially, I’d estimate, 4 or 5 miles from it and it was easily over 300 feet wide and 200 feet tall.  The color seemed to be a dull battleship grey.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
UFO sighted over Mission Valley.;2011-07-20 13:13:00;9 minutes;UFO sighted over Mission Valley. I was going on Interstate 8 East in the Mission Valley area of San Diego when I saw an oddly shaped aircraft.  It was black It was hovering over the Grantville area of San Diego. I got off the freeway and pulled into a parking lot.  I paid closer attention to the object. It was going too slow to be a plane and too large to be a helicopter.   might have been two of them.  It slowly moved westward towards the beach.  I left before I could see it go any further.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Rectangle four white lights two red flashing lights moving slowly big large err with caution - uncertain;2017-08-31 21:00:00;30 seconds;Rectangle four white lights two red flashing lights moving slowly big large err with caution - uncertain Have seen 4 UFOs in my lifetime.  One was iffy.  Could have been shadow play.  This one confusing, too.  Illusion?  Wish my boyfriend would have let me stop the car to look.  Will explain.   Appeared to be a rectangle.  Large like a popular grocery store.  Four white lights, each corner.  Two flashing red lights-like you see on airplanes-side by side on the back end.  Back-end as in relation to the direction of motion.  Floating.  No regard for gravity. Angles staying in the same formation as the craft moves alongside the roadway.  As in towards and then away from my perspective.   If this was not an unidentified aircraft, then it could have been multiple aircraft flying in formation, far away, giving the appearance of forming a solid shape.  But the red lights confuse that possibility.  Also, live near an Airforce base.  Could have been a giant helicopter.  But still frustrating to work out.  Windows rolled up.  No radio, but no sound!!, still.  Even if! far away, would have heard the jets.  If close, would have heard propellers.....wish I could have pulled over.  Silly train to catch.......;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
