Objects over San Diego, CA.;2014-05-14 20:00:00;2.5 hours;objects over San Diego CA Wednesday, May 14, 2014  Around 9pm, I was called by my girlfriend to go to the balcony facing North, she said that there were some strange aircraft hovering in the sky east of downtown.  I head out to the balcony to see what she was talking about and yes in fact there were 3 white lights in a triangle formation hovering in the sky, motionless,   The sky was very clear absolutely no clouds very calm wind and there was some air traffic but more than usual for the airport nearby you could clearly see what were clearly planes or a helicopter these lights were not a conventional aircraft.  Of the three the one in the center was the largest and had the most distinct shape, that of a diamond.   At first it appeared to be one large craft but after looking at it for about 3-4 minutes the lights began to separate and move away from each other slowly at first, then in a blink of an eye they seemed to have traveled a good distance from each other.  They stayed at a relatively far distance from each other at this time, and stayed in position from what seemed to be an expanded triangular formation.  At this point the lights went from whitish blue to flashing red, green, and blue.  Sometime after watching the lights sit in place for a while I heard a jet fly by south of the house I looked and did in fact see a jet, what was odd Is that this aircraft was at around the same distance away but I could hear it where as I could not hear the 3 strange objects when they moved.  Two more lights appeared after a while but these stayed closely together one was hovering over the other and to the side at a small distance almost like it was supervising over the object below it.  Some pictures and video was taken but the quality is not good the lights I observed can be seen but the shape is a bit distorted.  All the lights eventually began rising slowly straight up into the atmosphere and eventually disappeared. On a side note I did observe the house pets (cat and dog) acting very erratic, running around and specifically the dog running up my leg, 2 more dogs from some neighbors also began barking.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Three diamond shaped objects sighted moving SW of Lindbergh Field.;2014-07-05 21:05:00;1-2 minutes;Three diamond shaped objects sighted moving SW of Lindbergh Field. July 5th, 2014 Time: between 9:05 to 9:08 pm  Area:  South West of Lindbergh Field  Duration: 1-2 minutes  While watching an airplane on approach to Lindbergh Field, I noticed 3 flying diamonds that were flashing a bright orange color.  They appeared to be in formation and moved at a moderate speed toward the clouds.   As the first one entered the clouds the second and third object hovered outside the clouds.   Within seconds the second object disappeared into the clouds.   At least 30 seconds went by before the third object disappeared into the same clouds.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Orange Diamond like shape light with a long tail. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:05:00;5 minutes;9060 Friars Blvd, looking east. Orange Diamond like shape light with a long tail. The tail goes away and a large circular cloud forms around the object. The light disappears into the circular cone shape cloud with the point facing away from me. A large cylindrical turquoise cloud almost perfect in shape comes out from the cloud and remained for a couple of minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.

Bright object behaving strangely.;2018-08-09 20:25:00;20 minutes;Bright Object Behaving Strangely. I was speaking with a family member on the phone and walked over to my glass patio door to look outside.  A bright object in the sky at about the 11:00 position and to the west caught my attention.  That would put it over the Pacific Ocean.  It was very bright, but was not shimmering like a star.  I’ve seen Venus hundreds of times and this was probably 2 times the size of Venus.  It was roughly diamond shaped (with no defined edges) and had an orange-ish tinge.  It was also much too low to be a star as I could make out the thin, broken layer of high clouds behind it.  So, my first thought was that it was a helicopter, especially given that there is occasionally police helicopter activity in the area and the altitude seemed about right.   I continued to watch it, expecting that the object would turn/move soon and I would see its aviation lights, but it just remained in the same position for about 15 minutes.  Then I thought I saw it wavering sideways just a bit, so I lined up the edge of a palm tree with the object, and sure enough, it had a very subtle back-and-forth horizontal motion to it.  I never saw any aviation lights.  I still assumed it was probably a helicopter, and I was still having a conversation on the phone, so I didn’t open the door to see if I could hear a faint rotor sound in the distance.  Actually with all of the other city noise (i.e., nearby freeway, local traffic) and with the distance, listening for a sound from the object would have given an inconclusive result.   I continued to watch it and was about to lose interest, when things got even stranger.  The object faded out in place for a brief moment and then grew bright again, matching its original size and intensity.  It was like a light bulb on a dimmer switch and you quickly turn down the voltage to the point where the bulb goes out and then you increase the power until the bulb is at full brightness again.   At first I thought perhaps the effect was caused by clouds p! assing in front of the object, but again the clouds were much higher a nd quite thin.  After a few more minutes, the object started becoming smaller and smaller, until it was a tiny spec in the distance.  This had a very different visual look than the dimming.  This time it appeared more like the object flew away at a level trajectory (further out over the ocean) and then stopped.  This changed took only a matter of seconds.   I watched it in the distance for a minute or so and thought there was nothing more to see, so I looked away for another minute or two.  When I looked up at the sky again, the object was back, in the exact location described at the beginning of this report and with the same shape and brightness.   After a few more minutes, it did the same maneuver again – appearing to move away very rapidly at a horizontal/level trajectory with the object becoming a tiny spec in the distance at the same location as before, except this time it completely disappeared. About halfway into this event, I noticed what were obvious airplanes (aviation lights visible) slowly circling far away from the object while it was in its original/stationary position.  It seems that these airplanes had their approach to the San Diego airport interrupted.  I say that because once the object disappeared as described above, an unusually high volume of airplanes started flying through the original area where the object was.  These airplanes were clearly headed to the airport.  //End of Report//;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
