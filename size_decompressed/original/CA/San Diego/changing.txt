UFO hovering behind our backyard, the night of May 10,1978;1978-05-10 20:30:00;25 minutes;UFO hovering behind our backyard, the night of May 10,1978 Sorry it's taken so long to to tell what I've witnessed in the past. I'll never forget that night, for it was like it happened yesterday.  It was Wednesday night, 8:30pm, and this new show I had been anticipating to watch was starting to begin...I remember, seeing the credits listed at the start of the show, then all of the sudden my sister screamed my name, and it was in such a way that I thought something had happened to her. I ran upstairs, to find her looking out of our bedroom window, ran over to the window myself, to discover a saucer-shaped object approximately 45-50 feet hovering behind our backyard, outside our fence toward the canyon. The saucer was dark, but it's outline was really defined, and the bottom of the it was silver like in color with rotating flashing lights.  Anyway, the object began to give us a show. It continued to hover over the outskirts of our yard, and it's lights began to change, first blue to red, red to white, then white to orange, and it continued doing this.  Then all of the sudden, the object disappered, then reappeared, but this time in another form.  The object looked like the letter T lying on it's side.  Actually it's reminded me somewhat of a the little twisty key like object on a container of corned beef or spam, the kind attached to the container, used to open it I hope this makes sense.  In any case, this T shaped object was dark, but very defined as well, and then it disappered, and the saucer-shaped object reappeared. The saucer continued to rotate it's lights a little while longer, going from red to blue, white to orange, and then it started to move, swaying side to side, going west. The craft contined going west, swaying side to side, until my sister and I could no longer see it, and then it was gone.  Realizing it had been there for a while, I looked at the clock after it left, and it was 8:55pm. How we ended up seeing the object in the first place, is that my sister saw this blue flash of light coming over the hill, east of our house (which is behind my parents' home). My sister mentioned two years ago--the first time we've discussed this matter in years, that when she first saw it coming over the hill, she immediately ran to lock the front door, then called me upstairs, which explains the fear in her voice when she yelled my name. To this day, I've always wondered how we ended up with this object hovering behind our backyard, but I will certainly carry this memory around with me the rest of my life.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Perfect cone shape light in non foggy conditions turns to a spider web shape then fades away.;2002-09-19 19:45:00;30 Seconds;Perfect cone shape light in non foggy conditions turns to a spider web shape then fades away. About 75-100 feet of the ground, my friend and I while walking the dogs at night, saw a light hanging in the sky as if it were on a pole, except ther was no pole. The light was shinning down at a 45 degreen angle to the ground in a perfect cone shape. The end of the cone did not fade like light would, it cut off perfectly and flat on the bottom. It was a light as if you'd see in fog conditions, except there was no fog and not a single cloud. We stood and watched for about 15 seconds when it suddenly turned into a spider web shape. The spider web shape was glowing and was perfectly symmetrical. It then faded fairly quickly leaving a light glow then completly went away. And no this was not a spider web at all, we are for sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  Please see article.  PD)) ((BEGIN ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE ABOUT LAUNCH)) Air Force Test Missile Out West Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly, said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said. Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show. We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early, Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets. Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is, Gabel said. The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability. ((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS));32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

white lights w/ sm. blinking red light, changing and waving like a firecracker, changing erratically, expanding and contracting.;2004-10-16 18:30:00;5 minutes;white lights w/ sm. blinking red light, changing and waving like a firecracker, changing erratically, expanding and contracting. Merging onto the 805N bridge in Mission Valley of S.D. to the NE of my vehicle ( over my neighborhood ) I first saw a very bright white light and one small red fast blinking light of an aircraft flying North at what appeared to be a similar altitude of local small planes and helicopters. It immediately kept my attention as the the lights on this aircraft would change drastically. At first, it can only be compared to the waving of a firecracker. As it curved in the sky small bright lights would expand out into a wild flickering trail and then it would compact again and as I exited off the freeway into my neighborhood, I was compelled to follow it as long as I could. It was high enough for me to keep a constant visual. As I caught up to it slightly, it would dim down to just the red light almost going out completely only to come back strong again. The last time I saw the white lights expand-out I was closer and so it was more defined, appearing that the lights were attached and in a half oval shape ( very Spielberg-ish ). I have no idea what this could honestly be. It was brillant against the black sky.I followed until it had dimmed to just the red light and then it dimmed out completely. I waited one minute but it was gone.  It had continued North flying over Miramar until it vanished. I had driven to our quiet local airport, Montgomery Field. There is an aircraft show this weekend at Miramar but I cannot imagine an acrobatic plane capable. To the east I could see in the distance normal aircraft coming in from the east.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Craft exhibiting a bay of red lights flew in from over the Pacific, hovered for several minutes, then flew off into spa;2007-11-14 20:17:00;15 minutes;A craft exhibiting a bay of red lights flew in from over the Pacific, hovered for several minutes, then flew off into spa We live in San Diego, just west of Lindberg International Airport. We are used to seeing all different types of aircraft flying by and around our home: small private planes, jumbo jetliners, military aircraft, helicopters, etc. Never have we seen anything like we saw on this night. As my wife and I were planning our Thanksgiving dinner, I glanced out a window facing west. I noticed a craft flying in from over the ocean and at first thought nothing of it. After taking a second look, I couldnâ€™t help but notice the uniqueness of this craft. It displayed lights of a shade of red that I have never seen before on any craft. Also, the initial shape of this craft appeared to be rectangular, and it flew perpendicular to the ground. The more I watched this object, the more curious I became. I picked up a pair of binoculars to get a closer look. I thought perhaps I could discern a clearer shape. However, viewing it through the glasses did not prove any better than viewing it with the naked eye. All I could make out was that it seemed to be a flying bay of lights. Fully engaged, I walked outside to continue following the path of this object and attempt to detect any sort of noise. At this point, the craft quietly morphed into a spherical shape. When it appeared to stop its forward progression, I called to my wife to have a look. Begrudgingly, she came outside, but within minutes, she too was enthralled with this craft. It quietly hovered for several minutes then began to move slowly toward the west and gain in altitude. After some small flashes, it continued to fade into the night sky and was gone.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

7 or 8 sphers amber color;2012-05-12 23:00:00;60 seconds;7 or 8 sphers amber color The view from my Apt. is NW unobstructed except for some trees.  In fact I look out at Sea World, which is what drew my attention when I heard 2 bomnes that sounded like fire works goinging off.  That's when I saw 4 or 5 amber sphears creating a diamond and 3 or 4 traveling behind creating a triangular shape.  They were just drifting yet faster than airplanes and smoothely headed north dissapering into the fog.  They came from the west low then rose it seemed as they headed north.  Other then the first 2 booms there was silence.  I have lived here long enough to know these where not normal airplanes,however Camp Penalten is north of us so maybe they were military.

Looked like it changed shape from sphere to elliptical.  Metal material, kept reflecting the sun, it was a clear day, no clouds.   At one point it looked to have blown out some smoke/light around it.  It headed east after about 15-20 minutes.  Looked back up five minutes later to see another sphere floating above, this one white and not reflective.  The metal one came back and they hovered together for about 15 minutes.  I glanced away and they were gone.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Honestly I didn't even see it until I looked at my pictures I was showing my son the moon. Upon looking at him I saw green orbit   That change direction. I think it was moving so fast I couldn't see it but I have a pretty good camera.  I Was smoking a bowl of marijuana, which I always do if not more, and I somehow passed out and woke up on the ground with dirt all over me.  My dad was showing me the pictures after I showed him, and he said that there was another one and I was like no that's nothing but when looking at the pictures I saw it and it change shape and direction as well... I have pictures of Before & After and during maybe, but I'll sum it all so that you can analyze it.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
