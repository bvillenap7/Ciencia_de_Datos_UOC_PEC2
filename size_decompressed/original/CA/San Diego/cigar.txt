a cigar shaped object with a light at the end seen in La Jolla, which made no noise, and was pursued by military jets.;2000-07-05 20:20:00;2-3 minutes;a cigar shaped object with a light at the end seen in La Jolla, which made no noise, and was pursued by military jets. As I was running on the U.C.S.D. campus at about 8:20 at night, my attention was drawn to the moon and the obgect I saw going beside it. It first appeared to me to be an airplane leaving behind a smog trail. However, I then noticed that the trail was not getting longer as the object moved significantly towards the ocean. Then I realized that it was not a trail at all, but rather a single object with a light in the front, wich I originally thought was an airplane. This could not have been a conventional aircraft first and foremost because of its size. The object would only be covered from my eyes' view if I would hold out a pen a few inches from my face. This is too large for any conventional aircraft, considering that the object was pretty high in the sky. It was also NOT making any noise. A few minuters after this object dissapeared in the westwardly direction, I saw 4 black fighter jets headed in the same direction (these were making plenty of noise) as well as another fighter jet following the first four about 30 seconds behind.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

Bright green mass of light;2004-01-24 19:40:00;5 minutes;Bright green mass of light My friend saw a green cigar shaped light on a cloudy night. She called me and our other friend out. We all watched it for 5 minutes as it dissapeared and reappeared a couple of times, remaining at the same spot. The green light was incredibly bright and of a color very phosphoric. It did not have any source or a tail. It was just like a mass of green light on the sky. It was quite high, probably as far as Venus. We weren't able to see it again, as it got cloudier.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
witnessed small oblong object with red and blue lights hovering above my vehicle.;2004-03-12 21:20:00;5 sec;witnessed small oblong object with red and blue lights hovering above my vehicle. I was traveling west on Del Mar Heights road at approx 21:20 in the evening. Traffic was very light, and I was stopped at a controlled (traffic light) intersection. I had the sun roof open and witnessed a small (approx 6-7ft in length and half as wide in silhouette) oblong oblect with red and blue lights with no other distinguishing features. It was traveling at a leisurely pace from the north east to the south west. It was just above the tree line (roughly 80 feet above the ground). It passed directly over my vehicle and was completely silent. I initailly disregarded it as a small helicopter but was rather perplexed by the fact that it made no sound at all. It was a warm evening and I had both of the front windows rolled down and the sun roof open. I would have heard any sound that it made above a whisper.  I then turned northbound on the I-5 freeway.  At 22:15 I had run my errand and was returning home on the south bound I-5. As I entered the exit ramp for Del Mar Heights road I caught site, in my peripheral vision, of red and blue lights above my vehicle. I looked up through my open sun roof and saw the same object that I had witnessed earlier directly above, and keeping pace with, my vehicle. This time it was no more than 25 feet above me and again making no sound what so ever. I slowed and it slowed with me. I felt my wheels on the shoulder of the exit ramp and looked back at the road for only a second and looked back up. The object had disappeared.  The weather was dry with a light marine layer building in above approx 150 feet. The object was well below the marine layer on both sightings.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906

It was a cigar shape, grey in colour, quite large and moving towards the plane.

Confirm a report dated 02/12/09 in San Diego at approx 20:00 hrs.;2009-02-12 19:45:00;At least an hour;Confirm a report dated 02/12/09 in San Diego at approx 20:00 hrs. I was outside sitting on the back covered patio of the house where I rent a room. I looked up into the sky to the southwest and saw a strange looking light that I 1st thought was the moon until I could tell wasn't as the moon was located obove the patio roof more to the south. I could see the moons lumination on the ground.  As I watched the light I noticed that it was moving slowly towards the direction that I was in and was getting larger. Its shape was like a shollow plate on the bottom with an inverted upside down bowl on the top.  After about 5 minutes the object slowly changed it course so that it was moving to the North.  I don't know its size but I would have to guess tht it was a few hundred feet long and possibly 75 to 100 feet high.  As it was going to the North noticed that it had a small red light on the top and a small red light in the Tail end. (south end) The lights were not flashing. I have worked at a large Naval Air Station for close to 30 years. This craft was not anything that I had ever seen before. It made no sound at all. It appeared to be lit up from the inside as a tube light.  It was not overly bright and I could hear some of the people in the neighborhood oustside saying things like look at that thing etc. Shortly after the craft started in its northerly direction, I went inside and told a couple of the people what I saw and we went out to the front yard to watch it. After watching for a while longer we went inside.  I watched the news that night and nothing was said about it.  The local San Dego paper the next morning had a small article about some some fiery objects in the sky the just previous night.  I did not report it then with my view as I figured it would probably be covered up some how anyway.  I just happened to be looking at this site on the internet for the 1st time and decided to see if the incident was reported here. It was. Let me repeat, only one large fat (in the middle) cigar shaped object was seen from our view.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
Cigar-Shaped UFO, sited off the San Diego Coastline.;2017-10-26 18:15:00;5 minutes;Cigar-Shaped UFO, sited off the San Diego Coastline. On the evening of October 26th, 2017, I witnessed and filmed a cigar-shaped UFO from my balcony.  I was able to take two videos of it before it disappeared behind some trees. I went out to my balcony to look at the sunset, which I do every evening, and I noticed a cigar shaped (glowing bright white) object, hovering in a vertical position.  It caught my eye because it was so bright.  There wasn’t a cloud in the sky, so it was easy to see. When I started to focus on the object, it rotated to a 2 o’clock position, and then started to descend in a slow, deliberate manner.  As it descended, it rotated to a horizontal position, as it was moving south.  It descended to a few hundred feet off the ground, and then continued to move in a somewhat straight line, until it disappeared behind some trees in the distance. I live in San Diego, CA, approximately 3 miles from the ocean.  The object looked to be a few miles off the coast.  Also, as it was moving south, a commercial airliner flew in front of it (on video).  It gives a good perspective of how large it was.  Even though the object was a few miles west of the airplane, it seemed to be as large, or bigger than the plane.;32.8495788798915;-117.172097047906
