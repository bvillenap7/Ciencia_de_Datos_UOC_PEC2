This past weekend of the 8th while camping in the Yucca Valley area, my three girlfriends and I were admiring the full moon.  One on us wondered if certain three (3) lights in the sky were planets or shooting stars because it seemed like they were “active”. Just then, we saw them shifting, moving, arranging themselves into a triangle up on the sky then one by one they flashed a light. Flash, flash, flash.  Then and almost impressible light kept them connected to one another.  Like one of those laser sables from Star Wars.  It was there, but you almost couldn’t see it.  They were still there, when we walked back to our camp a few minutes later.;34.1618999999999;-116.433499999999
Strange light over Yucca Valley Ca;2020-07-05 20:00:00;3-5 minutes;Strange light over Yucca Valley Ca This object came from the east at a high rate of speed. At first it looked like a shooting star.  The object made a hard right turn headed north for about 45 seconds then made a U-turn heading south until it disappeared.  The object made no sound. I am not sure how large it was.   PS love you on the coast to coast show.  Keep up the good work.;34.1618999999999;-116.433499999999
