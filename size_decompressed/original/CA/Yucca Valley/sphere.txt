Large, bright white orb due east of Yucca Valley;2012-10-02 19:30:00;10 seconds;Large, bright white orb due east of Yucca Valley I was sitting outside on our front porch in the dark at 19:30, facing due east, when a bright led-like white single sphere/orb came straight down from the sky and disappeared behind houses or hills somewhere between 500 feet and one mile away.  (It is difficult to gauge distance in the desert in the dark.)  I was waiting for an explosion noise, but there was only silence. It was not war games at the 29 Palms Marine Base, which is more than 20 miles away.  We are star and sky watchers and I have never seen anything like it before. Coincidentally, there was unusual animal behavior today.  We feed and water the wild birds and today less than ¼ of the usual number of mourning doves and 1/10 of the usual number of Gamble’s Quail showed up at the normal feeding times.  But there were 3 times as many rabbits as we have ever seen.   Our house was also overrun with ants for the first time since we moved here at the beginning of the summer. The weather was not unusual in any way (temp, humidity).;34.1618999999999;-116.433499999999
