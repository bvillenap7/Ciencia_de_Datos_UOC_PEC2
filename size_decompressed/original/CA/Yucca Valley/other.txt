Straight  line of evenly spaced lights moving slowly R -L  ((Starlink satellites??));2021-02-14 05:30:00;3-4 minutes;Straight  line of evenly spaced lights moving slowly R -L February 14, 2021 5:30 am Yucca Valley, California  I looked up in the sky and saw equally spaced lights that were continuously moving in a straight line.  At first I thought it was a group of stars but these lights were evenly spaced, in a straight line and were slowly moving from right to left. The right side of the line was slightly higher than the left side-not parallel to the earth.  From my perspective this appeared to me at a 45 degrees angle form where I was looking up â€“ not as high in altitude as a transcontinental flight- there was no sound except for an alarm going off somewhere behind us. I woke up my partner to come see if she could see what I was seeing and she saw it too.  We both observed these lights, both videoed the sky where the lights were, and both observed these lights (as a grouping) slowly leave, moving towards the Joshua Tree area until they were no longer visible. All of this lasted maybe 3-4 minutes.  The video recording I took on my phone shows very little- only a single blinking light- if you would like it please email me and I can email it back- i just don't know how to adjust a filter that would show what i saw and I dont want to compromise the raw footage.;34.1618999999999;-116.433499999999
