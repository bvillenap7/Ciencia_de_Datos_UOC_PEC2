((Sirius??));2005-03-15 19:00:00;2-3 hrs;object hovered,one object disappeard,another seemed to come after the original,which left at high rate of speed. One object stayed almost stationary for several hours.My wife noticed this object first and seemed to be over a nearby marine base.I at first thought it might be a radio tower light but it was to high.I have a small mountain range in that direction(which is NE from my back yard) for reference. the object could also have been over Arizona.On clear nights visibility here is excellent.The object had red and green lights that that flashed intermitantly.with the naked eye the object was just noticable lights.From my telescope and binoculors the object seemed to tilt and had a disc appearance.The object stayed in its general position for a couple of hours moving up and left to right occationally.I was going to dismiss this as a satalite but it just didnt act like a satalite.I actually got the feeling it was watching something. My wife had went to bed and I went out one more time to look at the object.It had moved slightly and then I noticed another one exactly the same just to the right of the orignal.It moved quickly up, to the right and disappeared.Then I noticed a white dot That simply seemed round moving toward the original object.It came down from the right,stopped,and made a straight line for the colored lights.I got my binoculars and by the time I looked(2-3 sec) I didnt see the white dot but the colored lights were coming my direction very fast.I went to get my wife which took 2-3 sec and by that time the object was over us moving very fast.Seemed to have a triangle shape, very high, very fast,could not follow with binoculars,no sound,no trail,continued west and then I lost sight.stayed for several minutes to listen for jet sounds,heard nothing.Thats It. Im a lineman(power company),My wife is an accounts payable manager for construction. Just dont know what it was.;34.1618999999999;-116.433499999999
Amber Lights;2008-07-09 22:35:00;10 seconds;I drive 5 days a week from Yucca Valley to Apple Valley on highway 18.  Tonight I saw an amber colored light over the eastern mountains.  It hovered briefly then became brighter.  It moved very fast at a 45 degree angle and rushed toward the ground.  It was moving so fast I thought it was a meteor.  As it traveled down, behind it appeared 5 other amber lights.  These lights did not move, but remained stationary in the path of the light.  The moving amber light stopped briefly then shot up very quickly in a semi circular path leaving more lights.  At the top it stopped again and dove straight down with no additional lights.  The lights that were on went off in succession.  During my drive thru the desert I have seen meteorites, and shooting stars.  I have seen flares over the base in 29 Palms.  This was unlike anything I have ever witnessed.;34.1618999999999;-116.433499999999
