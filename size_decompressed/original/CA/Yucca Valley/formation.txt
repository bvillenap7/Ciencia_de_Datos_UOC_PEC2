In a dark desert sky, the glowing orbs remained at approximately the same altitude the entire time they were visible. It appeared as though they were slightly moving to align with each other. These unidentified reddish-orange orbs conjured up images of the 1997 Phoenix Lights sighting, featured by the History Channel, although they appeared in a different configuration. The glowing lights with a reddish outline appeared oval in shape at one point, just before they finally lined up.  The remaining circle brightly glowed in the sky and then disappeared into the darkness of the night. The writer of this article personally observed and photographed this sighting.
