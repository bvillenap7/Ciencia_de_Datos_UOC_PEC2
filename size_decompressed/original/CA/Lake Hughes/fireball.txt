Missile test my ((obscenity deleted)).;2016-07-27 21:45:00;unknown;Missile test my ((obscenity deleted)). Comet-like in appearance, however, the object was moving much, much slower than comet. I got about 15 - 20 seconds of view time before it disappeared from sight behind a mountain (as I was driving).   The object was extremely bright and seemed at high altitude, with a bright comet-like tail that seemed to produce light of its own.   Its slow movement betrayed its large bright trail. It appeared to be separating into multiple objects (looked like 3 of them) as it disappeared from my view.  I would imagine this (ufo) will be reported far and wide (at least through southern California.) I saw the mass reported missile test ufo last November from the same area, except - I must say, this one being altogether different in appearance, and heading in the opposite direction (east).  If that is a missile,  WTF kind of a missile is THAT?!...;34.6809;-118.5451
