I looked up and noticed a very distinct formation of lights about the size, shape, and brilliance of  stars travelling down the sky, staying in exactly the same formation. They were not moving as slowly as an airplane nor as quickly as a shooting star -- somewhere in between, but again, they looked as far away as the stars did so they must have been going relatively very quickly. I saw them for about 15 seconds, when they started getting dimmer  (as if travelling away from the earth) and then  disappeared from view. The formation looked something like this: ..     ... .  ...      ..      .. .             ... I was walking with my boyfriend at the time, and although I tried to point them out to him, he was not wearing his glasses. He is near- sighted, and by the time he got his glasses out and put them on, the formation of lights was too dim to see.;37.423;-122.1639
