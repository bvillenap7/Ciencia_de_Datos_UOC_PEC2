I was standing outside and noticed something flying slowly and completely silentl from the Northwest to the Southeast and it looked like it was on fire. It was moving a little slower than the speed of an airplane kind of like that of a helicopter. It didn't look like a meteor, there was no tail behind it. My wife and two children came outside and witnessed it too.   Approximately one to two minutes later we saw another going in the same direction. They passed dierctly over my house and then turned slightly more to the south after passing by.;38.68214;-121.77342

My son, ((name #1 deleted)) 10, my brother ((name #2 deleted)) 41, and i  ((name #3 deleted)) 33, witnessed a object fflying from SW to E.   The object was bigger than a plane (and hand no blinking lights), orange-red in color and no sound.   We witnessed it travel from SW to E at a speed faster than a plane.  Being that the house we were at is 12 miles from the airport we are used to seeing  planes,  THIS WAS NOT A PLANE!!!   We watched it move from SW to E at a rapid speed.   Once it approached the airport it disapeared.   We stared for approx. 1 min. more.   Nothing reappeared.   That is when we called 911, they dirrected us to this number.  We called 1-206-722-3000.  They instructed us to write an essay to you.   This is no joke!   What we witnessed was an Unidentified Flying Object.  You may contact us at 916-((number deleted)).   Please let us know what you have learned,  because we are truely scared.;38.68214;-121.77342

They were unlike anything I have ever seen.  They appeared as if they were hovering/floating in an upward, diagonal direction.  The orbs would float higher and higher until they disappeared one by one.  The entire event lasted about 5-7 minutes. I work in the middle of town near both residential and industrial areas.  I am not sure exactly how far the orbs  were from myself.  The Orbs did not make any noise that I could hear.  They were a glowing orange color and glowed at a consistent brightness.  As I said, I am not sure what I saw, I only know that I have never seen anything like it before.;38.68214;-121.77342
Bright orange orb hovering in the sky but also dancing around and abruptly vanishing;2021-08-10 21:00:00;2 minutes;Bright orange orb hovering in the sky but also dancing around and abruptly vanishing The object  was a spherical/circular shape and was bright orange. It was moving up and down and then quickly vanished. Inside the circle looked like another dimension of some sort it was extremely bizarre. Only 1 object maybe 300 feet up in the air. I alone witnessed it and Iâ€™m 18 years old. I attend the University of Southern California. After I examined the video I took it looked more like a donut.;38.68214;-121.77342
