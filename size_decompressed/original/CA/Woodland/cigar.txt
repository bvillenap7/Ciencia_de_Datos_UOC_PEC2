Cigar shaped object flying through sky then suddenly vanished.;2007-06-18 14:00:00;1 minute;Cigar shaped object flying through sky then suddenly vanished. Husband and I saw a cigar shaped object flying across sky. It was flying in the same movement and speed as a jet, yet it had no wings. Also, as we watched it fly across the sky, the object suddenly vanished right before our eyes. The sighting was seen about 14:00 hours on Sunday, June 18 right outside of Woodland, California - east of Woodland. There are 2 military air force bases close by, therefore it could have been a new type of military jet not known to the public. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  Date is flawed.
