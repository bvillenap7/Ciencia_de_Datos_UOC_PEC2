Dog barking just before I went to bed...I looked out the bedroom window.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD));2005-02-10 22:00:00;1 hour;Dog barking just before I went to bed...I looked out the bedroom window. Dog barked and barked before I went to bed I looked out window to see what she was barking at and there was a large star in the sky...they look much bigger without my glasses...so I went to put my glasses on.  The sky was overcast and you couldnt see any stars.  I live close to sacramento flight path.  I thought maybe it was a helicopter.  I went and got bi-noculars and it was a circular bright light with a lot of bluish lights all over I would guess it was the bottom.  It moved around alot as I proped my arms up against the glass for steadyness.  It must have been going higher also as it would get small all of the sudden, and then you would see the large circle with lights again ..I must have watched it for 30 min.  and called friend who lives 6 blocks from me...he had to go outside...to look in the direction I was asking him to look which from my home in Woodland would be looking towards Davis.  There is a lot of farm country between the 2 towns.  Also in the same direction would have been Travis AFB...but I could not find a contact on their website.  I gave up when my friend couldnt see it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  PD));38.68214;-121.77342
