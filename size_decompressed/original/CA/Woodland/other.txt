Daylight sighting of tailed UFO cluster.;2015-09-09 19:00:00;2 minutes;Daylight sighting of tailed UFO cluster I was driving down Main Street and noticed a group of people near the sidewalk looking up and pointing at the sky.   I was driving in the opposite direction and really wanted to see what they were looking at, so I pulled over into the nearest parking lot, looked up and saw a cluster of what appeared to be very large roundish dark colored UFO's with tails floating high above me.  There were at least 30 and all were moving in unison.  I watched them float and move slowly through the sky for a couple of minutes.  I very quickly moved my car over a few spaces, as my view was partially blocked.   I looked up again and they were gone.;38.68214;-121.77342
