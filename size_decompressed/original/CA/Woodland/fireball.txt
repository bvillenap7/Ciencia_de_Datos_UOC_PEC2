We were waiting in our car at Jack in the Box and up in the sky we saw two bright lights that looked like fireballs... one seemed to be chasing the other, they were about a mile or so apart at first and moving very fast and steady keeping their distance from each other , they were moving diagonally and then changed to moving directly up , they began moving slower and the second one caught up to the first ,, we saw a v shaped beam coming from the 2nd object then they got side by side appx 50 ft apart and just hovered there in the sky, then they moved so that they were one on top of the other and the second one (bottom) had a v shaped light that looked like fire dropping from it they stayed like that for appx 2 min and then both bolted up and completely disappeared... we had our camera and took pictures;38.68214;-121.77342
