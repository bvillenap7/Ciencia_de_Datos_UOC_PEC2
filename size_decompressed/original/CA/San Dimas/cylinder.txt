Cylinder shaped object at high altitude;2001-08-05 16:30:00;4 minutes;Cylinder shaped object at high altitude I was in my backyard around 4:30 pm when I noticed to the NE a white cylinder-shaped object at high altitude traveling at high speed in a SSE direction. This object did not compare to the familiar shape of a jet, i.e. there were no wings, no tapered fuselage, etc. I already had my camcorder outside with me on the patio table because I had planned on video taping my kids so I took the opportunity to fire it up and film the object. The entire footage lasts about 3 minutes as the object finally moved out of viewing range in the distance toward the SE. I studied the footage and it was clear that this object was cylinder shaped with a notable shadow on its bottom and possible dome-like structure. The footage is currently under study by several well-known UFO investigators, and the early results are encouraging.;34.1049;-117.8132
