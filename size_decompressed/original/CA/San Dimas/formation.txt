V-shape formation of orbs flying low and silently over our roof;2015-10-20 20:00:00;5 seconds;V shape formation of orbs flying low and silently over our roof On Tuesday 10-20-2015 between 8:00 pm and 8:15 pm I saw a V formation of lights from our back yard in San Dimas. I was looking up towards the North / East direction at stars when I saw the V formation with 5 to 7 lights and it appeared to be only a couple hundred feet above the roof. This V formation of lights was going in an East to West direction.   It made no sound passing over our roof.  The lights seemed to be like bright white  orbs but at the same time kind of transparent.  I jumped out of my chair and tried to follow it but it disappeared within 5 seconds.  I had goose bumps and all my arm hair was standing up which my wife saw when I ran in and told her about my experience.;34.1049;-117.8132
