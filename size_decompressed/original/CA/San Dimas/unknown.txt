While my roommate and I were sitting outside talking there was spontaneously an extremely bright flash of light that lit up the entire night sky lasting a quick second, followed by a white/purple/blue tail of light that quickly disappeared within 3 seconds.  It was completely silent, made no noise at all.  The dog next door started barking for a short while.  Canâ€™t find any information about it online, at all.;34.1049;-117.8132
