Two Bright UFO's over the San Gabriel Mountains on June 21, 2001;2001-06-21 23:35:00;one minute;Two Bright UFO's over the San Gabriel Mountains on June 21, 2001 I saw two extremely bright lights traveling westbound over the San Gabriel Mountains. It appears both objects were independent of each other but traveling together, like two flies following each other. The objects radiated a bright white light like a shiny star but more intense and closer to the earth. The light intensity changed, possibly flickering but remained very bright. The lights would disappear and re-appear a split second later in a totally new location similar to fire flies but moved at high-rate of speed.  At times the light kind of just bounced.  Being late night, I was only able to see the bright light and nothing else. Please contact me via e-mail.;34.1049;-117.8132
