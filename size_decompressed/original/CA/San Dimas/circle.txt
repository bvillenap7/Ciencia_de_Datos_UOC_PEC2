On March 2nd, at around 1:40 PM... I took my grandson to our backyard... and I noticed a group of white circles in the Northern section by the hills.  The circles appeared in large numbers...could estimate around 20 to maybe 30... the formation was not uniform, as when you see docs flying all together... they appreared for a few seconds...then disappear... they moved very slowly...and at times you could only see 1 or 2...  Because of the distance and their altitude...I ruled out the possibility of being birds...  I took video with my phone camera....which it has an escellent resolution 1080P...HD....the video clearly shows when they appear...and dissappear...I would like a professional opinion...I will email you a short video...and you can see for yourself....and determine what could possibly be.
