Orange orb traveling north/west.;2016-07-27 22:20:00;5 minutes;Orange orb traveling north/west Around 10:20 Pm, I looked out my sons window and saw what I thought was an orange drone flying north.  It isn't uncommon to see drones because Beale AFB is 10 miles north of my house.  But something about this one was different.  This one seemed to be higher up in the sky than normal.  It wasn't flying in a straight line like every one I've seen.  It seemed like it had short burst of speed and would veer to the west when it had a burst.  I decided it was worth watching and so I went out front and watched it until it disappeared.  This one ended up heading North West and ended up heading over the Sierra Nevada mountain range.   There was two times I though I saw a faint blue orb flying next to it.  It might of been a satalight but it never once dimmed like the ones I usually see.  I saw the object for about 5 minutes.   My dad was a pilot and I am obsessed with planes. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the date.  PD;38.8897;-121.2873
