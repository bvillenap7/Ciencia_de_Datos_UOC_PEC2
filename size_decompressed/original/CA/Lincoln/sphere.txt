Three Spheres moving in formation;2005-11-18 22:30:00;15 seconds;Three Spheres moving in formation Friday evening as I stood on my back porch , three round glowing objects suddenly came into vision from behind the limbs of a large oak tree. I live just east of Lincoln Airport in Northern California. they were silent and moving in a perfect arrow formation. They looked to be about 700 to 1000 ft up, (airport pattern altitude), almost overhead of me but a few hundred feet west and moving very fast, apx 300 or 400 knots. They were close enough at first that I could see their sphere structure, but no lines or dots or ribbing or anything, just opaque globes. They appeared perfectly round and exactly alike. They flew like they were a single unit but I could see space between them. There were no lights or twinkles or anything like that. If I wouldnt have been gazing right up there I probably wouldnt have noticed. They were mostly white but ever so slightly orange tinted. Their coarse looked like due north and about 6 or 7 seconds into my event the formation made a slight but instantanious course change of about 5 or 6 degrees west. It appeared to be a perfectly angular turn with no perceptible curve. That really blew my mind. I watched and strained to hear a sound as the formation became so dim I could no longer see it. I never heard a sound. It was really dark, visibility was very good, the moon was rising . The whole thing was over in about 15 seconds. I know what I saw, I just dont know what it was I saw. One other thing that occurs to me,if you check out your maps you will see that at that speed and course they would very shortly be over or near Beale Airforce Base which is a pretty secure base, (SR71 / U2 types).;38.8897;-121.2873
2 sphere type yellow objs SE to NW with no streaks or flashing lights and fast moving in one dir..  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS & Shuttle?  PD);2007-11-05 06:00:00;5 min. + -;Two sphere type yellow objects Southeast to Northwest with no streaks or flashing lights and fast moving in one direction. It was a clear early morning sky with Mars nearby last quarter of the moon in the eastern southern positioned.  The two fast moving yellow objects resembling the moon in color were traveling southeast to northeast. One trailing the other in perfect sequence.  As to the size of the objects in question it would take two plus or minus of these for the size of the middle of the quarter moon.  No flashing lights, no trail, no other movement but straight forward in direction. We considered this a serious sighting of  (2) sphere’s round and yellow in color objects on November 6th, 2007 at 06:00am. ((NUFORC Note:  If the sighting occurred on November 05, as indicated above, then we suspect the witnesses observed the ISS and Space Shuttle, just after they undocked before the Shuttle returned to Earth.

Red, blue green lights of one unit observed in patterns back and forth and large circles.;2013-11-15 21:30:00;5 minutes;Red, blue green lights of one unit observed in patterns back and forth and large circles. Lights green, red, blue in color seemingly floating back and forth and in a circle pattern.  Moved to right, made patterns, back to the left, made circular pattern and then slowly went out of sight and low in the sky.  We observed this ufo for approximately 5 minutes before it slowly moved to the right.    I am a resident of Sun City Lincoln Calif and have a college degree and am a retired teacher.  My friend is also a resident and former business owner.  We observed the object that seemed to be at a height of 3000 feet.;38.8897;-121.2873
Low alt. flyover of red turning to blue then back to red sphere. Rapid departure.  ((NUFORC Note:  Model airplane??  PD));2014-04-23 23:15:00;25-30 seconds;Low altitude neighborhood flyover of red turning to blue then back to red sphere.  Rapid departure. A deep red sphere was seen hovering over the Hoit District neighborhood approximately 200 ft above the ground.  My friend and I were on bicycles returning home 1/4 - 1/2 mile west of object.  While watching the object slowly move southward, approx. 3/10 mile as a deep ruby red color, it tuned into a deep blue color, still spherical or circular shape.  It was larger than a car and smaller than a house.  It was blue for approx. 10 seconds then turned completely deep red again.  It seemed to climb slowly to perhaps 300 - 350 ft., hover about 5 - 6 seconds then darted horizontally toward the northeast for a very short distance then quickly descended or dipped toward the ground toward Virginia Town Rd. and Fruitvale Rd. and out of sight.  We waited a while and did not see it again.  My friend thought it might be a RC helicopter but I know it was too big to be a model and moved to fast to be a model during the departure from the area. Flying a model requires line of sight and there are too many trees and power lines to fly in that area.  The red and blue colored light were bright and soft, a unique wavelength.   We rode through the neighborhood looking for anyone who might be flying a model.  No neighbors sighted outside.;38.8897;-121.2873
