Triangular red, green and blue glowing & flashing object in Lincoln, CA, night sky.;2013-08-12 21:30:00;20 minutes;Triangular red, green and blue glowing & flashing object in Lincoln, CA, night sky. My Husband and I were cruising around town on August 12, 2013 around 9:30PM when we noticed a flashing red, blue and green object in the sky over a small section of town called Sun City.  It would fly up, hover for a bit and then fall.  When I witnessed the first “fall” of the object, I thought for sure it was a plane crashing. However, after its’ rapid descent, the object returned back into the sky.  My Husband and I followed the object, where it passed over into the Twelve Bridges section of Lincoln, CA.   We stopped the car and got out… the object slowly came towards our car, then hovered right above us.  I am unsure how high in the sky it was, all I know is it had very vibrant red, blue and green glow to it.  When I say it was flashing colors, there were not just a few lights, the entire object was glowing the colors. I stood there staring at the object for about 10 minutes as it just hovered above me, a car approached over the hill and I looked away from the object for a minute.  When I turned back I noticed it rapidly moving away from us back towards the original sighting area where it ultimately disappeared . I attempted to chase the object again in my car, however, my attempts to find it again failed.;38.8897;-121.2873
