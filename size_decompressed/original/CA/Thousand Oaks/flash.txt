Loud sound and a search light coming from sky - definitely not a helicopter.;2012-12-03 03:24:00;30+ minutes;Loud sound and a search light coming from sky - definitely not a helicopter. On the 2nd I was awoken by a whirring sound. I wake up around 3AM often, so I'm not sure if it was the sound that woke me or if it was natural.  The sound was alike to a lawn mower, and got louder and then would fade at random. When it came close at one point, I saw lights flashing in my room and through the trees.  When I looked out, it was too dark to see, but the light was coming from the sky. It went over many houses, I thought it was a helicopter, but the sound was more unreal. It had more bass in it, and a higher frequency. It was definitely not a helicopter.  The light specifically kept pointing in a tree in my neighbors yard, not at me or my window, but it did go into my window and then into my bathroom's window too. It scared me pretty badly, and I was unable to sleep till it ended around 4. Sometimes the lights would change colors, and my electricity kept going out.  There was a light trail in the sky after it left but it faded quickly.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197
