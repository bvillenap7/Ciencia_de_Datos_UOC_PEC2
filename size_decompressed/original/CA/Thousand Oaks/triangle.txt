It blacked out the stars it was so big. big black triangle, no sound, no other aircraft in area, blocked out the stars behind.Weather station reported 56 degrees, winds out of the northeast, visability was unlimited, no clouds. Although there was a slight haze in the area.It had three maroon lights at each corner.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197

Lost view as it went behind a tree. I was chatting in thousand oaks ca.my freind was oblivious talking to me.I had noticed a black object the shape of a soft edged triangle with a drifting s.e. rotation.  I said what's that!  The time was 3:02 roughly.it was very black under a overcast sky.when they first saw it the one guy was insistent it was a helicopter.  but no sound at a distance of what seemed like a couple thousand feet.  a height of about 1000 feet.  Speed seemed like 50 miles an hour.another witness saw it moving slowly in a 360 circular motion.no noise.  it covered about a mile and I had to climb onto a wall to keep seeing it.  i know for a fact I would probably not pick it up well on my phone because of the lighting available.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197

Black flipping triangle with metal reflection flying above my house.;2020-06-12 13:30:00;6 minutes;Black flipping triangle with metal reflection flying above my house. While taking a break from work I came outside and gazed at the sky. At first I thought I was looking at a black bird flying high in a cloud and then realized birds don't fly that high. While taking a closer look I noticed the craft was black and triangle shaped but something odd was happening. As the craft flew it was consistently flipping over from wing to wing. Every time it would spin a metal reflection would shine from the craft. My daughter came outside to see what I was looking at and described the same thing. After about 6 minutes the craft flew out of our view.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197
