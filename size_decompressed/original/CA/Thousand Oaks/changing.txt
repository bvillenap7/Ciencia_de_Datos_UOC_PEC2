Dark unlit UFO, that initially looks like a soaring bird then it splits into two crafts.;1999-02-15 20:15:00;2 min;Dark unlit UFO, that initially looks like a soaring bird then it splits into two crafts. I was getting out of a boy scout meeting for my 7 year old nephew the house was in a poorly lit neighborhood. I could see lots of stars. I was smoking a cigarette and my nephew had to go to the bathroom and went in the bushes. While we waited to go home, I saw a rabbit and then looked up and told my nephew to look at the huge bird flying above us. I initially thought it was a bird because there were no lights on the object. The craft resebled a wingspan of a bird, long and thin. I thought it was going roughly 20 miles per hour at an assumed distance of roughly 150 feet up. I continued to watch the object while it flew toward the horizon (southeast with 101 fwy, oceanside). The opbject had what appeared to be stripes on each wing and I waited for wings to flap. There was little to no groung wind. After watching the objectgo into the horizon I was confident still that it was just a bird but still watched. Then it did something amazing, the object split in two parts just before it was near the horizon and each part/wing went off in east and west directions until I couldn't make it out in the sky. I was in the Air Force for the past 6 years before the incident and have seen many  planes fly in my presence including the B2 and it was definately not a public jet. The object made no sounds, and it was a quiet night. At first I thought it was dumb to report this but then I thought about all the other types of sightings I had seen on TV and thought since mine was different then all of them I should report it. I have made a crude animated gif file of the sighting I have uploaded. ((NUFORC Note:  We received an illustration from the witness and will attempt to post it in the future.  PD));34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197
Bluish light that turned into four over Thousand Oaks, CA.;2013-12-02 19:22:00;20 seconds;Bluish light that turned into four over Thousand Oaks, CA. I was driving south on the 101 freeway going into Thousand Oaks.  I had just finished getting over the grade when I had no choice to but notice a large bluish light just above the santa monica mountains.   It was directly in front of my view and I'm sure the other cars next to me saw it too.  After around five seconds of seeing this, the bluish light pulsated and tripled it's size.  Almost looked like a star gate was about to open up.  Then it quickly went back to its original shape.   Then, three more similarly colored lights with the same shape appeared to its left in perfect order, but in a somewhat curved shape (like a smile).  It also looked like it could've been either a large object firing on all its lights.   After around 20 seconds, the light simply dimmed and it was no more. I scoured various ufo reporting sites and came across a report that matches what I saw here: http://www.theblackvault.com/m/events/view/-UFO-Holographic-like-bluish-lights-fly-over-Burbank-California;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197
