I was driving home from work, and as I was approaching a stop sign on the road, I saw two lights coming straight towards each other. I thought it was two planes about to crash.  I noticed that they were moving very fast and the objects were a solid colored light and not blinking like a regular aircraft. Just as it looked like they were about to collide, one light circled the other and they both took off in sync at a rapid speed going West. I stopped in the middle of the intersection because I was very frightened, and through the trees I saw them break off and travel slower at a more normal speed. I turned the corner and straight ahead out the window  the lights were in sync again now traveling  faster going South. Far from where I just saw them before, then out of sight.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197
bright light in sky every night for last 8 nights and counting.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus in the western sky, we suspect. PD));2010-07-30 21:00:00;3 hours;bright light in sky every night for last 8 nights and counting CA For about the last 7 or 8 evenings, starting at roughly sundown (around 8:30 pm) , a very bright light appears in the sky over what I estimate to be Camarillo, which is the next town north from where I witness this strange nightly occurrence.  I have viewed it from several different vantage points, both with the naked eye and with binoculars, a well as taken pictures.  Anybody who looks up at the sky could clearly see it. It is not being shy or covert at all.  It doesn’t seem to move much except to make a very slow descent behind the big mountain that makes up one half of the Camarillo grade (101 freeway, where truck scales are), so by 11:30 or so, it ha disappeared from my view. It does appear to change colors occasionally, from brilliant white, to a hazy yellowish orange, to a bluish white glow, and sometimes a red aura appears on the top part of whatever this is. It also appeared to have some much smaller, much dimmer lights come off it in several instances over the past week.  Because there is a military base nearby ( Point Mugu) I at first thought it was some kind of helicopter holding its position in a military exercise of some kind. And it might be just that, I don’t know what it is at this point. I wouldn’t have even come here to post this, except for a caller I heard on the Coast to Coast  radio show that described how he was seeing a strange bright light in the sky from sundown to 11:30pm, and this had been every evening for the last week or so. He went on to describe the very same characteristics that the light I was seeing possessed.  The show host told this caller to report his sighting on this website. So I figured I should do the same with my sighting, for whatever its worth. I unfortunately did not hear where the caller was calling from, but would like to find out if it’s the same light or two different ones in two separate places. I guess I will just continue to watch it at night, and to try to get some better pictures of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus in the western sky, we suspect.

Very bright light increased in brightness then faded. there was no movement across horizon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Iridium satellite?

Walking dog in thousand oaks a bright white light started to shine in the sky without movement became very bright then quickly faded away.  It appeared to be a light that was coming down into the atmosphere as it looked like it had a halo around it similar to when you shine a light in fog.  The key here is that it did not move across the horizon like a satellite it was a stationary light and it was very bright white. ((NUFORC Note:  Iridium satellite?

Unidentified, red and blue lights seen moving together at a high rate of speed and in random directions in Thousand Oaks, CA.;2014-01-21 06:00:00;20 seconds;Unidentified, red and blue lights seen moving together at a high rate of speed and in random directions in Thousand Oaks, CA. The incident I witnessed took place in Thousand Oaks, CA (SE Ventura County) at approximately 0600 – 0615 hours on Tuesday, January 21, 2014.  The weather was cool with a light breeze.  The sky was mostly overcast with some stars visible.  It was still dark.  The moon had set. My location was in a shopping center parking lot on Janss Road and N. Moorpark Road, located about 2 miles north of US-101 freeway and about ¾ of a mile west of the CA-23 freeway which runs north and south. At approximately 0600 hours, I happened to look up into the eastern sky and saw two lights, one blue and one red, very close together, not moving.  The lights appeared at first glance to be what I thought was a hovering helicopter, from 500-1000 feet off the ground.  The angle of the lights to me was about 60 degrees.  The two lights were bright, clear and distinct.  I would describe them like an LED.  There was only a tiny separation between the two, but it was distinct.  They were separate, but very close together.  I would describe the size of the objects about the size of the planet Venus or maybe a tiny bit smaller.  I could not see any type of aircraft or fuselage or body that they were attached to because of the darkness of the sky.  If I held my thumb up to the sky to cover the object, it would cover the lights. Because I was at work at the time, doing security for a construction crew,  I had to get about my business and giving the stationary lights one last glance, I resumed doing my job. About 5 minutes later, I happened to glance up to the eastern sky once again, wondering if the two lights I saw were still there.  Indeed they were, but they were moving horizontally across the sky from south to north fairly rapidly at about a 65 degree angle to me.  Then, the lights immediately began to do all sorts of strange things that you would not associate with normal aircraft.  They dove down like a roller coaster and then swooped back up in a sharp climb.  The drop was to about 30 degrees and then back up.  This repeated – down, up, down, up –sharp and fast.  There were other quick motions that I’ve never seen any aircraft do – quick changes of direction on sharp angles, for example. Again, all of the movement of the paired lights was done at a high rate of speed.   The object(s) then rose to about 60 degrees and took another sharp, high speed dive and went below my field of vision – the buildings of the shopping center not allowing me to see to the horizon -- and did not return. Overall, I would describe the general motion of the object(s) or lights if you will, as almost entirely random in direction, moving as I said at a high rate of speed.  Total duration of this portion of the sighting was about 20 seconds.  I had a smartphone with me, but I was too transfixed by the incredible movements of the objects to get it out and start to record it. Also, during the entire time of the sighting, I heard no noise from the direction of the lights. I thought that this might be a model aircraft, but not hearing any noise at all – along with the lights – eliminated that possibility.  IN FACT, there was a hobby shop in the shopping center that featured remote-piloted model aircraft and I went into the shop and asked the owner of the shop if he knew anyone who’d fly these craft at night.   He said he didn’t know of anyone who would.  Second, I asked him if it was common to put lights on the craft.  He said the craft he sold didn’t have lights attached.  So with these questions and the noise factor, I think I eliminated the possibility that it was a model aircraft. In addition, aircraft do not have red and blue lights.  Or lights that don’t flash. Obviously, the object wasn’t a normal airplane with capabilities as we commonly associate with them nor was it a helicopter either.  Because of the description of the flight of the paired lights and that I was not able to see a body, fuselage or anything else that the lights were physically attached to, moving in the manner that they did,   I decided that I had seen what could be described as a UFO and made this report.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197
