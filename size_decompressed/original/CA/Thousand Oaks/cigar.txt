The difference was there was a series of noise that affected the appliances making them flash on them off more than once.  I noticed that the aquarium light was the only light that remained on after the power supply was interrupted. The clocks on the microwave and oven were reset.  I was located in the kitchen/living room the whole time and saw this all. I walked outside for reason unknown, just felt compelled to. I saw a craft in the sky which moved across overhead until eye level, my head tilted slightly up.  The craft paused then dropped directly down at a higher rate of speed than the movement halfway across the sky. The craft had a white lights across the center and shaped like a cigar with middle thicker than ends. I am an open-minded person, yet needs facts,  mainly seeing or experiencing to truly accept and believe, whatever the case is. Th! at day seemed very long to me.  I set a mechanical Sturling watch at one point in the morning which now states a different time.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197
