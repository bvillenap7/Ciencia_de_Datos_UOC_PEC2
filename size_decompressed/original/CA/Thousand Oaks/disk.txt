The object or light would move quickly from right to left, and move in a circular motion vertically.  ((NUFORC:  Possibly Venus?? PD));2004-12-18 05:05:00;25 min.;The object or light would move quickly from right to left, and move in a circular motion vertically. 5:05 A.M. on Saturday the 18th, 2004, I noticed a Bright Light over the southern Santa Monica Mountains behind my home. This light was what I believed to be a star but was only several hundred feet above the mountains. I watched this light for a while as it changed colors from Green, to Red, to Blue. I believed it to be from X-mas light reflection, but then I noticed the light would move quickly from right to left. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me so I got up to see what it was and if it was windy outside. No wind and the sky was bright like a full moon. When I noticed that the light could not be from X-Mas lights or anything imaginable I took out my binoculars and noticed the light was bright white and moving in a circular motion vertically and would shift from right to left hundreds of feet and stop. Occasionally a bright white light would reflect off the mountains below this light lighting up the entire top of the mountains. I watched this light for about 20 minutes then woke my wife to see what I was watching. Within five minutes of this the light dimmed into a glow and suddenly disappeared.  The next morning at about the same time I looked out the window for the same star or light, and there was nothing there. ((Husband's name deleted))  At around 5:25 a.m. on Sat. the 18th, 2004 my husband woke me up and told me he wanted me to see something.  We went into the family room to the sliding door and kneeled down on the floor.  Outside above the mountains, what seemed to be south and several hundred feet away, was a huge star.  This star was larger than any star I had ever seen and seemed to sit not far above the mountains.  The sky seemed to be well lit and it changed from white to blue and then green.  My husband was trying to focus the binoculars for me, and as I continued to watch it, all of the sudden the light turned off and there was a faint glow of light in the sky and it was gone in the blink of an eye.  It was gone by 5:30.  The next night and morning I couldnâ€™t sleep and was looking outside every hour for the same thing to happen.  There was nothing there.
