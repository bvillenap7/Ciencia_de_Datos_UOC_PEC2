Three high speed orange lights in a long narrow triangular pattern over Thousand Oaks CA.;2005-01-12 20:01:00;4 seconds;Three high speed orange lights in a long narrow triangular pattern over Thousand Oaks CA. I have been an amateur astronomer for over 45 years.  In the old days, I listened to Sputnik and watched the ECHO satellites.  I have built telescopes and have spent many hours watching and photographing the sky.  Over the years, I have seen all of the usual UFO candidates like satellites, flocks of birds, highflying aircraft, balloons, blimps, and rocket launches (we can see them from Vandenberg).  So, I am reporting this in the hope that someone can give me an explanation for what I saw.  The sky was clear and dark.  I was looking for a comet when I saw three orange lights (approx magnitude 4) traveling at an apparent high rate of speed from north to south, passing about 3 degrees west of the Pleiades.  I believe that their altitude was greater than that of an aircraft on approach to LAX or Burbank.  Even though the sky was dark and clear, the lights did not appear to be true points of light, as the stars did.  I had the impression that they had ?dimension?.  It was as though I was viewing them through a light cloud, but there were no clouds.  One light was distinctly ahead of the other two by at least 2 degrees.  The trailing two appeared to be side-by-side with approximately a ¼ to ½ degree separation.  One of the trailing two then appeared to overtake the other and their separation decreased to near zero.  The one that appeared to overtake the other then went slightly ahead.  They all vanished about 45 degrees above the southern horizon.  There was no sound or trail.  The behavior is consistent with a typical satellite, except that there were three at once and the apparent passing of one by another.  I checked satellite-viewing websites and could not find any naked eye satellites that would have matched what I saw.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197
UFO sighting over Thousand Oaks, California.;2014-02-21 21:04:00;2 minutes;UFO sighting over Thousand Oaks, California. At approximately 21:04 on the night of the 21st of February, I saw a formation of four lights traveling at a constant velocity in a south westerly direction over Thousand Oaks.  Its path took it across Orion's belt.   There were four lights in formation.  From a bottom up perspective in the direction there were three on the left and one on the right.  A total of four lights together.  Almost as though it was a USAF missing/fallen pilot formation. Lights did not blink and faded before exciting the horizon.  Similar to a visual on a satellite which will vanish before the  horizon.  If there are any confirmations or witness to this particular sighting I would be interested as to what you're hypothesis may be.   The closest resemblance to what I saw would be of the lights described best as the Phoenix lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
