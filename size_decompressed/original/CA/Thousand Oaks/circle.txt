I saw a large round yellow glowing object close to the ground far off in the distance and did not take note of it because I thought it was a full moon close to the ground.  It was partially blocked by some thin trees.As I lay there, the object began to ascend very very slowly.  As it began moving, I jumped out of bed and ran to the window watching as it rose above the tree level and house level.  I cannot tell how far off it was -- perhaps a few miles.Once it finished rising, it sat in the sky for a few seconds not moving -- then in a split second shot off to the right, disappearing.  I ran out of my room, down the hall, and into the living room which was the direction that the object flew.  I looked out of the sliding glass door in the living room, but the object was gone.Again, it was just a round, glowing, yellow object, with no other distinctive features.I have only told a very few select individuals about this over the past almost 20 years -- people that I knew would at least believe that I was not lying to them -- even if they don't happen to believe in UFO's.  When I heard about your organization, I figured I would at least log this siting with you -- perhaps it can help you  in some way.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197
Distant very bright object holds position over 20 minutes then moves rapidly, slows to near stop then explodes and falls toward earth.;2006-02-02 17:30:00;30 minutes;Distant very bright object holds position over 20 minutes then moves rapidly, slows to near stop then explodes and falls toward earth. Just after the sun had set while looking South West at the moon, which was about 50 degrees high in the sky,  I noticed a bright light at about 30 degrees high and around the 5 o’clock  position from the moon, which I assumed was the planet Venus, very bright. It was very slight oval to circular in shape and had a bluish haze to it. After grabbing binoculars (10 x 50) and observing the object in the same position for around 20+ minutes it suddenly and very quickly moved to the 9 o’clock position of the moon and continued to move toward the 10 o’clock heading north at a very slow rate.  At that moment there was a large puff of misty light-grey smoke and the object immediately dimmed and exploded into red flames and plummeted towards the earth.  As it fell, smaller pieces broke away, and the flames appeared to grow brighter until after a minute or so of falling it burned out and I was unable to continue tracking due to low light.  However, for a moment after the flames went out I did see a dark object continue to fall.  As far as distance from me that the object was I can only guess at least 10 miles maybe 70.  It did take well over a minute for it to fall about 8 inches at arms length.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197

Altitude, maybe around 5000 feet and very slowly moving to the east, and no sound.  This was not a balloon or a bird. I looked thruogh binoculars and it just looked white and round, maybe oval. The second sighting was about 10 minutes later in the same spot, slowly moving east, looked exactly the same. Not balloons, or a balloon.  Judging by the airplanes in the LAX flight path, the object could have had a 20-30 foot diameter.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197
a light apeared in the Northern sky thrust across the sky and dissappeared then reappeared leaving con trails.;2010-09-25 21:30:00;2 minutes;a light apeared in the Northern sky thrust across the sky and dissappeared then reappeared leaving con trails. At approx. 9:30 pm in the Northern sky I saw what appeared to be a plane hovering in position with landing lights on. All the sudden the craft beamed a single light that appeared as a spotlight pointing down at a 60 degree angle towards the earth then it dissappeared and reappeared 2 seconds later.  The craft with one thrust traveled south at a very fast in a straight line leaving behind it a single con trail and vanished or about 3 seconds before it reappeared and  repeated the same single thrust motion in a straight line and  vanished in the southern sky.  The contrails were visible in the light the full moon for a good 5 to 10 minutes after the event.  The entire event lasted about 5 min.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197
Orange star like.;2014-04-11 22:05:00;ongoing;I was walking my dog , looked up and saw a bright orange star like star that I have never seen before.   I came in the house and went on line at the end of a conversation on radio speaking about orange sightings.  It may be nothing but I thought I would report this and let you make a decision on what it could be.;34.1965959641256;-118.837579372197
