2 objects that looked like stars moving at high speeds;2003-07-04 22:05:00;1-2 minutes;2 objects that looked like stars moving at high speeds Me, my boyfrien and dad were waiting for the fireworks to start.  Me and my boyfriend were looking up at the stars and I noticed what looked like a star in the sky.  It was moving at very high speeds and sporadically. I pointed what I saw with my dad and boyfriend.  None of us had any clue what is was there were no blinking lights like a jet and it looked like it was to fast to be anykind of plane that we knew of.  After about 30 or so seconds of whatching it, the object grew or produced a very big blue light around it.  The bright light went away after a couple of seconds.  After the bright light we saw another light.  It was traveling the exact oppisite direction as the other craft we first mentioned.  We watched both of these lights until we couldn't see them anymore about 1-2 minutes total time.  Note: this incedint happened before any fire works went off in the sky.  This was not a firework for the fourth of july, nor any human made aircraft that we know about.  I am sure it was not a shooting star, the duration of the light and sparadic movement of the crafts prove this.;41.9309;-121.4325
