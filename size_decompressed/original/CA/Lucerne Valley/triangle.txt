Large Triangle spotted In Lucerne Valley, CA on a clear cool night;2004-12-14 18:28:00;6 Min;Large Triangle spotted In Lucerne Valley, CA on a clear cool night I am a powder train truck driver, after loading my trailers and leaving the plant I noticed a red light on, in the Western horizon, I looked at the time and noted it 6:28 PM. I stopped my rig on the side of the road to observe the object, turned off my engine and lights. Lucerne Valley, CA is in the middle of the desert so it's a very quiet and dark area located 30 miles East of the 15 in San Bernardino County. As I observed the object I noticed it had three red lights in formation of a triangle, it traveled at a good pace at approx 40,000 feet. It must of been very large because it seemed large. It was traveling from West to East. At 6:31 PM it stopped for about a minute and the lights turned in a circle twice, at 6:32 it began traveling East once more, I also noticed that it would block out stars in the back ground as it passed them by. By 6:34 PM the object became very faint in the western horizon to continue observing it, additionally, this was a very clear cold night and I also heard no noise from this craft at all. I took all of these notes to have a more precise report, I frequently watch the skies, and have seen many others in the past, but this is the first one I am reporting.;34.4466;-116.9169
