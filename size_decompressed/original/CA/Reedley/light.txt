Strange light observed over small california town.;2002-11-17 23:15:00;15 minutes;Strange light observed over small california town. I went outside to look at the stars.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a particularly bright star.  I thought to myself i don't recognize that star.  I don't know much about astronomy, but I look at the sky a lot at night.  As I stared, I realized it was moving very slowly.  No flashing lights like a plane, and much too slowly.  About 15 minutes passed as I watched it.  As I realized it was getting brighter, it sped up, and looked like it was fading.  About 2 seconds later, it was gone.  It had travelled about 4 times the distance it had traversed in the last 15 minutes in that final move.  Then it was gone.;36.6022;-119.4378
