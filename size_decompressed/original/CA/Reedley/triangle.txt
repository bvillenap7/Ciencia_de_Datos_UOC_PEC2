At a distance, I believes the craft to be a helicopter.  I thought it was shining a spotlight on us. As we got closer, I realized te shape was not that of a helicopter.  Also, I realized it wasn't making any noise.  As we got even closer, I realized it was a triangle. It looked to be about the size of a car.  It made no noise. It flew just above the tree line.  I knew it couldn't be an airplane because it was flying no more than five miles per hour.  As we got closer, it flew across the road and flew back in the direction it came from.  It just circled around us.  I was frightened, but my comrade stopped to observe. It was triangular, about 30 feet across, and flew no more than 70 feet above our car.  It flew about 5 miles per hour and had white and red lights on the bottom.  I thought it was a helicopter, but I could hear no propellor.;36.6022;-119.4378
