At about 9:30pm I saw a very large flashing light in the sky to the north.  It reminded me of the shape of a sword or an elongated diamond.  It had a main light in the center and emitted a vertical flashing light every 5 seconds.  It got smaller and faded away over the course of about 15-20 minutes.  I've never seen anything like it and have not heard anything on the news.  I thought it may have been the space station or a satellite but I'm not sure...;33.7082;-117.2392
