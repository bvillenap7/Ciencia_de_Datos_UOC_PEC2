UFO seen on Menifee,CA;2006-09-22 17:50:00;2 minutes;UFO seen on Menifee,CA I was on the passenger seat while going home and I glanced to the side and saw a bright metallic thing. At first I thought it was a plane, but when I saw that it stood still. It had the same shape of an airplane but a lot smaller. A minute after I then saw another one identical to the previous one. Once we passed by a tree it disappeared. THe object was about 1000 feet up in the air and about 1 mile away from Goetz and newport in Quail Valley on the east side. The object was metallic and reflected the sun. It looked about 40 ft wide and 12 ft high. It just hovered in the sky.;33.7082;-117.2392
