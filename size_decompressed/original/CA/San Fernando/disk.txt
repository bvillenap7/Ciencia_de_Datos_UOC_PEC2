I looked up to the south and saw a large aircraft hovering there at a very low altitude close to where the 5 freeway and the 118 freeway meet. It had red and green lights that encircled it so that we could make out the shape to be like a disc and in relation to the landscape it appeared to be much larger than any commercial airplane or helicopter. The lights flashed in a random pattern with an occasional couple of white lights flashing as well.  It seemed to stay stationary and then “jumped” around a few times within a close proximity of itself then began slowly flying north west increasing altitude as it went along. We were able to see it clearly    the whole time and as we approached the McClay Street off ramp the craft accelerated to an incredible speed and within a few seconds was gone from view.;34.287493150685;-118.43292739726
