WHITE LIGHT OVER SAN FERNANDO EXPLODES WHILE MOVING.  ((NUFORC Note:  Flare from Iridium satellite??  PD));2011-07-09 22:30:00;2 sec;WHITE LIGHT OVER SAN FERNANDO EXPLODES WHILE MOVING AND THEN GAINS SPEED AND DISAPPEARS AT APPROX 22:30 ON 07-09-11 I WITNESSED AN OVAL SHAPE LIGHT APPEAR IN THE SKY.  I WAS LOOKING DIRECTLY IN THE AREA OF WHERE IT APPEARED AND THERE WAS NOTHING THERE, SUDDENLY IT APPEARED, THE LIGHT BECAME REALLY BRIGHT (AS IF AN EXPLOSION), IT THEN MOVED FASTER AND THEN IT DISAPPEARED.  ABOUT 2 MIN LATER, THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  THERE WAS SOMEONE WITH ME THAT POINTED IT OUT,  BY THE TIME I SAW IT,  IT LOOKED AS IF IT EXPLODED AND THEN DISAPPEARED AGAIN.   THESE SIGHTINGS WERE NO WHERE CLOSE TO LAND.  THEY WERE AS SMALL AS A STAR AND LOOKED TO BE EXTREMELY FAR.;34.287493150685;-118.43292739726
