Large object that spawned 8, 10 or more bright saucer-type bright objects;2008-02-26 15:30:00;15 minutes;Large object that spawned 8, 10 or more bright saucer-type bright objects At approximately 3:30 p.m. February 26, 2008, on Truman Street (cross street San Fernando Mission Blvd), San Fernando, California, I witnessed what appeared to be a UFO.  The object was sighted in the southern sky and was a cigar-like object that appeared to have a slight dark or shadow side running diagonally from the tip to about 9 o’clock on the left side of the object.  It moved slowly across the sky for what appeared to be a mile or so.  It stopped moving horizontally but looked like it was moving up vertically.  Suddenly about 8 or 10 bright saucer-like objects appeared around the original ‘ship’.  They did not appear to exit the original object, rather they appeared around it.  The new objects moved about freely and effortlessly.  They even appeared to form geometric shapes (a trapezoid, a rectangle with 2 parallel lines of 3 saucers each, etc).  The bright shapes looked like fireflies circling the original object.  They disappeared as quickly as they appeared, flying for about 3 minutes.  The original object kept moving upward, moving from side to side occasionally.  Once more and about 5 minutes after they had disappeared, the saucer like objects reappeared and did a similar dance as in the first episode.  They disappeared much as they appeared-quickly and in unison.  The sighting was witnessed by at least 5 of my coworkers.;34.287493150685;-118.43292739726
