Initially we thought it was ome sort of conventional aircraft located around 3/4 mile due North and over a calabasas residential community.  After 90 seconds of observation, it became evident by the two green lights and its unusual movement and lack of sound that it was neither a toy, blimp, airplane or helicoptor.  The object changed direction in 90 and 180 degree angles.  We couldn't tell if it was a very small object a few hundred yards North of us or a larger object several miles from us.  We only know that it was between us and the opposing mountain range which varies from 6 to 20 miles.  Except for noting that the object appear! ed to be South of the halfway line (I.e. nearer us) there's no way to determine its size or exact location. It eventually moved due West (down the valley) and just as it was moving out of sight being obscured by a wall on the edge of our property, it stopped on a dime and descended vertically like an elevator.  It covered that western movement in about 30 seconds.  However, where it descended was in the range on the other side.  So either as it moved horizontally due West, it did so with a slightly Northward direction, or it had been further away suggest it was quite large and moving far faster than the maximum allowed by the local Air Traffic Control of 250 mph.  Depending on its nearness to us that distance could have ranged from 1 to 20 miles, 120 mph to 2400 mph.;34.1413727272729;-118.659807438016
