Unidentified object on Mulholland Highway.;1989-10-10 00:00:00;approx 5 min;Unidentified object on Mulholland Highway. I own a 1962 Triumph motorcycle that has a magneto for its ignition system. I was riding my motorcycle home on Mulholland highway heading east after leaving Las Virgenes road (headed toward the San Fernando Valley). About 1/4 of a mile east of Las Virgenes road (heading east on Mulholland highway) I noticed a red light in the sky south of the road. This light stayed far away from me but kept pace for awhile. The light then very quickly shot north from where it had been and stopped directly over me and at the same time my motorcycle engine died causing my motorcycle to stop. It happened so quick that I remember looking up and noticed a ring of red lights glowing and absolutely no noise at all. I also noticed that whatever I was looking at blotted out the stars and was very large. I estimate that it was about maybe eight stories above me. I also remember kicking the engine over on my motorcycle but it would not start. The object stayed above me for awhile and then still making absolutely no noise shot straight up into the sky getting smaller and smaller until it disappeared. As soon as the object was gone my motorcycle started when kicked over and I continued home. I have not told many people about this incident and to this day am not sure what I saw.;34.1413727272729;-118.659807438016
