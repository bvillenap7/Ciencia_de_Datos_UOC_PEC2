Lights in Calabasas, California;2005-01-04 17:45:00;2 seconds;Lights in Calabasas, California I was heading South/East on the 101 Ventura freeway, climbing over the Calabasas pass, approximately 0.5mi from Parkway Calabasas exit.  At about 45'F above the horizon towards the south side of the freeway, I witnessed what I could tell from a distance to be two bright and steady green & white lights.  Whether they were eminating from one or two objects, I couldn't tell.  But both were falling very very rapidly, with the green light dimming low.  The white light remained and disappeared out of my sight behind the mountains to my right.  I suspected a fireworks or flare, but flares flicker or would leave smoke or trail.  What I witnessed looked bright and clear.  I also suspected a falling star, but what I saw was definitely in vicinity.  I can also rule out an airplane or helicopter, since this thing was traveling so quickly, seemingly at a lower altitude, I had never seen anything like it.  I am also quite sure that many of the commuters crawling up that freeway witnessed the same, since one of them actually popped out his head to look.  Please share information on this site if you saw something similar in the vicinity during this day/time.  As for my background, I am a 31 y.o. male, working as a project manager at a nearby corporation.;34.1413727272729;-118.659807438016

A purple light started hovering above and moved left to right in a slow motion then slowly started hovering in a zig zag pattern heading towards City of Los Angeles,  While object was moving towards LA it changed its light to bright red for about 3 seconds then went back to purple and continued on its way, there was no sound heard while it was hovering we tried taking a video of it but it was so dark and high up it can barely be seen on the phone.;34.1413727272729;-118.659807438016
13 White lights with no sound traveling very high and fast in a linear fashion over 5 minutes.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-16 21:05:00;Continues;13 White lights with no sound traveling very high and fast in a linear fashion over 5 minutes Objects were very small, white lights in the night sky moving at a very fast pace.  Not usual aircraft lights, no sound and were very high up.  There were approximately 13 or more spaced apart equally traveling from a northern direction southbound.  The last one seen emitted a flash of light.  Approximate time frame from seeing the first one to the last one was about 5 minutes. I have good knowledge of aircraft and how they look in the sky at most altitudes and there were other aircraft in the area as normal.  This sighting was ongoing lights at equal lengths, one after another at an extremely high altitude almost not visible to the eye.  I even checked Flight Radar 24 and there were no aircraft on the radar in this particular space.;34.1413727272729;-118.659807438016
