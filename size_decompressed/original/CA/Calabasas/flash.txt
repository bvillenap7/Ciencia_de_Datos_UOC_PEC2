Fast bright object in Calabasas;2006-03-31 04:15:00;3 Seconds;Fast bright object in Calabasas I was just heading back from finishing my newspaper delivery route in Calabasas.  I had just turned onto Las Virgenes Canyon Rd. from Piuma Rd. when a bright white flash lit up the canyon around me. This was followed by a streaking object which passed directly behind my truck travelling south (saw it in my rear view after the sudden flash). The object was a very intense white and moved very quickly.  It seemed to be very low... maybe 50 to 100 ft. off of the road.  Shortly after it disappeared several street lights flickered and went out ahead of me.  Weird. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
