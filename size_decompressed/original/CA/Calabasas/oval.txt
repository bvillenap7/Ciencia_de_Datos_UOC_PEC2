Saw object while driving south on the 101 freeway.  The object was shiny.  There were two airplanes flying in different directions near the object.  The object seemed to be hovering in the air.  Then the shape of it changed slightly, almost as if I was seeing it from a different angle.  Then it completely disappeared.;34.1413727272729;-118.659807438016
