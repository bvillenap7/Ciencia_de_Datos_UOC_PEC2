Two large white lights in the sky over the hills in Calabasas, CA.;2003-04-28 20:55:00;5 mins;Two large white lights in the sky over the hills in Calabasas, CA. I was driving on the 101 fwy east just before 21:00pm last night.  I got off the 101 fwy at Lost Hills Rd. to turn right and noticed that there were two large white lights just above the hills towards Las Virgines Cyn / Malibu Cyn.  I've never seen lights there before.  As I turned right on Lost Hills, I kept looking and the lights didn't move and so I decided it wasn't a plane.  If it was a plane, I was not sure how they could have these two large white lights and not move.  The sky was very dark and since I was a few miles away, I couldn't see the shape too well.  Once I got home, my husband and I went back out and we drove all of Calabasas trying to figure out what I had seen, but nothing was out there.  By that time it was 21:30pm. I would like to know if anyone else saw anything. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at some length, and we found her to be an exceptionally credible witness.  She was quite eloquent and precise in her description of the sighting, and she seemed to us to be quite serious-minded.  She stated that each of the two lights appeared to be approximately the apparent size of a full Moon.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for the same date from California.
