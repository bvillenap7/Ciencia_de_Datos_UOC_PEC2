Two moving lights and a flash over Arcata, CA;2011-06-02 23:30:00;3-4 minutes;Two moving lights and a flash over Arcata, CA I was with my roommate and a friend, inside that same friendâ€™s backyard, late at night, during a very clear night sky of stars.   As we looked up in the sky at approximately a 60 degree to 80 degree angle, there appeared to be two moving lights (approximately 30,000 feet up?) that moved at a medium slow speed together in unison toward approximately the north direction, but at a certain distance apart (approximately 300 feet apart?).  They moved so perfectly aligned to each other in speed and distance that it seemed like they could have been part of a same single craft.   Eventually one of the lights started to fade, as it appeared to rise up further toward the sky (or maybe went behind night clouds), as the second light kept going on its course.   Eventually the second light started to gain distance, and also started to dim.   Suddenly, a large flash of light occurred in the sky over the second moving light that seemed much bigger and brighter than any of the two moving lights.  This large flash of light seemed to occur in somewhat close proximity to the second moving dimming light (approximately 300-400 feet away from the second light?). This sighting occurred two weeks and four days after another UFO sighting the same roommate and I saw in the same town of Arcata, CA.   I reported that previous UFO sighting on this UFO reporting hotline as well.;40.8760857142857;-124.076476190476
