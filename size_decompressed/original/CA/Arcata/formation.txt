Yellow Light UFO Formation over Arcata, CA;2011-05-19 21:15:00;3-5 minutes;Yellow Light UFO Formation over Arcata, CA Date:  5/19/11 Time:  Approximately 2115  Event:  My roommate and I were driving home in my car.  The radio was playing the song E.T. (Futuristic Lover) by Katy Perry.  I told my roommate, I think this song is about an alien.  Listen to the lyrics.   I then turned up the radio for us both to hear the lyrics.  That happened for about ten to twenty seconds before both of us saw strange yellow lights up in the sky. The best way I can describe what we saw is that there was a cluster of yellow lights together in what formed a ball-like shaped formation.  Underneath that cluster were three more yellow lights spaced farther away from eachother, in what looked like an angled triangle shape.  All the yellow lights seemed to stand still in the sky together as either a formation of different lights or crafts, or as one craft with many lights (I am not sure which). After seeing it, I asked my roommate, What the hell is that?!   My roommate responded similarly saying, That does look weird!   We decided that I would park my vehicle somewhere to view it.  I parked my vehicle on the side of a street, and we got out of my vehicle to view it.  Once we saw it again, the ball-like cluster of lights was gone, however the three lights that were underneath it before were still visible, and were still in an angled triangle formation.   The three lights that were left then started slowly dissolving or disappearing one at a time, till there was one light left in the sky, and then that last light then dissolved or disappeared. I saw a bystander walking near us.  I told him, We just saw a UFO.  He said he saw it too.  I asked him what it was.  He told me, You just said it.   I also asked my roommate if he saw what I saw, and he said yes.  He is just as amazed as I am on what we saw.  He is also willing to serve as a witness to this event. This UFO, when all the lights (ball cluster lights plus three triangle lights) were visible was very large and took up a good size portion of the sky.   For me personally, this was the third UFO I ever saw in my life, and the most amazing.

Red light surrounded by green neon lights hover a min or two in formation and dart quickly down;2012-07-26 21:50:00;3-4 minutes;red light surrounded by green neon lights hover a min or two in formation and dart quickly down Was driving southbound on hwy 101 in Arcata, CA around 9:50pm July, 26, 2012. My dad and I saw what appeared to be a red light closely surrounded by a number of green neon lights as on some sort of craft. It was hovering over the city near the hospital for some time (2-4 min) at what appeared to be a few hundred feet off the ground. We thought it was an antenna with lights on top of a building or maybe the Coast Guard helicopter.  That is until after a few minutes,  it darted down at an angle at a high rate of speed as if it had crashed or the antenna fell down. Until I learn more I am thinking more on the lines of it being a radio control aircraft of some type with a nice light system.;40.8760857142857;-124.076476190476
