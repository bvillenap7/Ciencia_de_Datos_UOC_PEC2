Multiple Northern California UFOs photographed at sunset with the evening crescent moon.;2011-08-03 20:52:00;2 min.;Multiple Northern California UFOs photographed at sunset with the evening crescent moon. At approximately 9:00PM PDT on August 3rd of this year, I was taking pictures of the sunset and crescent moon as I regularly due.  As I was reviewing the photos on my Canon G2 Powershot Digital Camera, I noticed that I may have captured the first stars of the evening with the moon.  This turned out to be a big problem though, when I returned to the deck to look for the stars, there were no stars-which should have been brighter by that time.  Next, I went to the computer to do some analysis.  What I saw on the screen was amazing.  Two disc shapes, weird squares, large moon like objects, and also a triangle-missile shaped UFO. Alan Fergason mentioned on Coast to Coast that he didn't see very much until he went to the computer to look, as was my experience, I saw nothing through the viewfinder when I snapped the shot. I took 12 shots of the sunset that night, some have nothing odd, others some, but on IMG_054 the ufo's are are amazingly vivid. It took me some time to believe what I was looking at, until I it coupled with the strange camera battery situation I experienced while taking the images. While taking these photos, my battery read close to dead, even though I was sure it was fully charged.  After reviewing the photos I checked my camera again and it then again was fully charged. Something really weird is going on, I'm sure of it.  I'd appreciate if you would help me analyze these photos further.  I've included the original and some blowups.  I have a PowerPoint poster too, which makes it easier to track and identify the UFO's. Location: Arcata, CA 95521 Date/Time: August 3, 2011 20:52 PDT;40.8760857142857;-124.076476190476
