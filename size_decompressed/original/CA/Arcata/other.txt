I was glad to be home and as i stepped out of the car and faced north to reach and open the back car doors to help my children out..I gasped and saw this huge..like size of the moon blue ball..it appeared in a burst then fell to the earth north of arcata with bright tails of flames following behind it. The ball was blue and the flames were red and orange and yellow. When we went into the house we had a racoon visitor and a skunk on our deck..which never happened..it was a very strange night..even the  wild animals seemed unsettled.;40.8760857142857;-124.076476190476
