It appeared to be getting larger as if it were an approaching aircraft.  Then it dropped altitude gained rapid speed and came to a stop approx. 500 ft. over the 101.  It was at this time that I noticed it had no aircraft beacon or navigation lights but was giving off one intense light that seemed to change color from yellowish to a bright white.  As traffic approached cars were slowing and pulling off the freeway, others were speeding up and trying to flee the scene.  As I travelled under the object I looked up and saw a dark circular edge around the light.  The object then accelerated vertically at which time the color turned a redder hue.  After reaching a height of approx. 3,000 ft. it headed west out over the ocean changing shape several times before dimming out as a foggy white light in a coastal low cloud layer.  I pulled off the freeway at the Avila Beach and there were other people pulled off the side of the road trying to figure out what it was.;35.176;-120.7327
