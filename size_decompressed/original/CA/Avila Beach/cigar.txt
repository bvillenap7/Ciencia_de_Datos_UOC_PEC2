Craft sighted at a nucular power plant;2002-02-01 07:00:00;6 minutes;Craft sighted at a nucular power plant I am an employee of pg&e corp.  I ( we ) have never reported this incident to anyone except our buddies at work and family friends, I suppose in fear of our job, would be the reason or our collectivly not being able to describe what we saw. dcpp is a nucular power plant, each year we are constantly trained to be the best in our fields. I am currently a plant insulator, but was a plant operator for a time. On the morning that this observation occured we , myself and 3 fellow insulator/coating spealists, were to clean and recoat insulators on a transformer located at the north end of the plant. While waiting for a qualified electriction ( for safety purposes) an airplane was observed coming from the horizion toward us. As it came closer to our position I, we, all noticed that it was not a normal airplane.  It had no sound coming from it's engine and no wings, as it came closer(2000 feet away) we noticed that it also had no lights. This being just after daylight was easy to see.  The speed of the craft was approx. 300 mph.  It then disapeared behind a knole approx. 1/4 mile north of the plant. We continued to watch, for a crash and flames, but in 30 seconds it reappeared heading out to sea, West, again at approx. 300 mph, but picked up speed and disapeared over the horizon at a very fast speed. Our eye level was at 90 feet above sea level, so we were able to see quite far out to sea.  Visability was exceptional. The craft was not large, probably 100 feet long and 20 feet in diameter, my best guess. It was shaped exactly like a cigar, color of silver or bright white.
