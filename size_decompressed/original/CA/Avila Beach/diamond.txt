UFO near Diablo Canyon Power Plant California!;2006-12-02 17:00:00;7 minutes;UFO near Diablo Canyon Power Plant, California! Sighting was in Avila Beach California during a Wedding Reception with nearly 200 people that was held in a very large tent on a Golf Course.  I am a Wedding Disc Jockey and the father of the bride (who is also a friend) asked me to check to see when the Buffet was to be served, I left the music playing and went out the side exit of the tent to ask the servers when dinner was going to be served and as I came around the corner of the tent the servers were looking at the sky and asking me what is that?  Now at this point I am upset because they should be working not looking at the sky and as I looked up I see a silver object floating between 500 and 1000 feet in the sky over Avila Bay!   This caught me by suprise and I viewed the object for at least 7 minutes.  The weather was clear and it was a beautiful day (no Fog!), the object was floating in the air and at times would move in very small circles.. there was not any noise or lights, this object had no windows and was not spinning!  This UFO was near Diablo Canyon Power Plant and I expected to hear jet's as I believe this to be a no fly zone (I did not hear any!).  I did not stay out side to see the object depart and the photographer for the wedding was busy doing a slide show and I could not ask him to take photos!  I did not tell the guest's as it would have ruined the Wedding Reception!   I am not sure of the exact time of this sighting!;35.176;-120.7327
