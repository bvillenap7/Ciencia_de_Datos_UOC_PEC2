Two bright white lights heading north;2003-05-21 04:35:00;one minute;Two bright white lights heading north After seeing my boyfriend off to work, I went outside to check out the stars in the clear morning sky.  I had taken a good look around in all directions when I noticed two very bright white lights on the eastern horizon that I hadn't noticed moments earlier.  As I stood there trying to be sure that they hadn't been there moments before, I saw that they were moving north together at the same speed.  I looked carefully at the lights, trying to see the flashing that would let me know they were typical aircraft.  The lights did not flash at all.  As I watched, the lights grew steadily brighter and then faded, as they moved, until they were no longer visible.;39.7306;-122.2586
Rapidly moving bright white light;2003-06-30 04:28:00;30 seconds;Rapidly moving bright white light Noticed bright, white light moving rapidly from south to east, with no flashing to indicate it was ordinary aircraft.  It moved quicker than an ordinary airplane would appear to at that altitude.  I watched until I could no longer see it, approximately half a minute.  Seconds afterward, I saw another dimmer light of the same description moving from east to north and it left a faint trail.  It was only visible for approx. 5 seconds.;39.7306;-122.2586

White, star-like light holds position in sky before moving slowly and then disappearing altogether.;2007-04-26 21:30:00;30 seconds;White, star-like light holds position in sky before moving slowly and then disappearing altogether. It was Thursday night, around 9:30 p.m., and my fiancé and I went out to look at the night sky while I smoked a cigarette before going to bed.  I looked up to see if I could identify some constellations I have become familiar with, and I thought I spotted the three white stars of Orion’s Belt just slightly west of directly above me.  I debated whether it was Orion’s Belt or not, because I was pretty sure I had been seeing the Belt in another location in the sky on previous nights.  While I wondered about it, my eyes drifted to another spot in the sky.  Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I could see that the middle of the three stars now appeared to be moving.  I asked my fiancé if he was seeing what I was seeing, and he said he was.  While we watched, the unblinking white light continued traveling west very slowly.  I don’t believe it was an airplane because of the slow rate of speed which commenced from a stop and there were no standard flashing lights.  I don’t believe it was a meteor, as I have never seen one move so slowly and only be visible in such a small area of the sky.  As soon as both of our attention was focused back on the light, it traveled just a second or two longer, grew just a little brighter and then just disappeared.  It ceased to be seen in the sky any longer.  I don’t know what it was, but after debating over whether or not to report what we had seen, I finally decided to do so.  I am Personal Assistant and Marketing Lead for my fiancé’s martial arts schools.  He is, of course, owner/operator of the schools as well as a Department Manager for a North State Grocery company.;39.7306;-122.2586
Large bright yellow-orange light appeared for 3 minutes and then disappeared completely;2010-11-21 22:40:00;3 minutes;Large bright yellow-orange light appeared for 3 minutes and then disappeared completely When I went outside to have a cigarette, I noticed a bright yellow-orange light in the sky south of me.  I estimate that it was anywhere from 5 to 10 miles away from me and just slightly above the line of trees about a half mile south of me.  It was a very large, non-flashing light and appeared to be moving slowly in a northeast direction.   I ran inside for my binoculars and one of my sons (so there would be another witness to what I was seeing).  As we watched, the light began traveling still slowly but more directly east.  At that time, the light began to fade and then went out.   We continued to look for it, and we saw a faint glow of the light appear before it went out altogether.;39.7306;-122.2586
Yellow-white light hovers before speeding off into the night sky;2011-04-23 20:35:00;1 minute;Yellow-white light hovers before speeding off into the night sky I look at the sky every evening, and in this way, I'm more familiar with what should be in the sky and where.  I went outside after supper and noticed a yellowish-white light at 37 degrees NE and just above the tree-line in the night sky.  I stared at it for a long moment because I knew that the light had not been in the sky on previous nights.  Then I realized that the light was moving ever so slowly towards the NE.  I only took my eyes off of it long enough to look back behind me and call one of my sons to come out.  When I turned my head back, I saw the light speed away towards the east faster than anything I've ever seen before.;39.7306;-122.2586
White light UFO spotted in Orland, CA;2014-08-23 21:20:00;30 seconds;White light UFO spotted in Orland, CA. My son and I were walking outside at 9:20pm and noticed a small, white light in the sky. It could have been mistaken for a star had it not been moving.  It moved SE away from us at a slow, even pace for about 30 seconds.  Then it moved a bit to the ENE and dimmed/faded into the darkness.  It made no sound.;39.7306;-122.2586
Bright light fades out.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare up of an Iridium satellite??  PD));2015-05-30 23:30:00;5 seconds;Bright light fades out. As I walked outside, I thought I was seeing Venus in the western sky.  As soon as I realized it couldn't be Venus, the light got brighter, much brighter, and then quickly faded out to nothing.

Eight round balls of light if you look at the picture video one appears not to be lit up;2017-11-28 01:00:00;5 minutes;Eight round balls of light if you look at the picture video one appears not to be lit up What we saw was not the pictures showing.  We saw what appeared to be clouds or some type of fog spinning in a circle. In pulsating in and out.  With the picture shows in the video are eight lights in the sequential order, as if there entering the mortuary across the street from my house.  We stood there and watch them for approximately 5 minutes walked underneath them to see if we could see beams of light coming from the top bottom or sides.  We saw nothing like that they appeared to be individual lighted crafts of some type.;39.7306;-122.2586
Nine white lights cross the sky in succession.   ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-26 21:00:00;15 minutes;Nine white lights cross the sky in succession I was outside looking at the clear winter night sky, all the stars.  Suddenly, I noticed a bright pinpoint of light moving across the sky, like a star that decided to move, only brighter. They had no flashing lights like our aircraft.  Their flight path was unusual because air traffic in this area is always north-south, and these were moving southwest to northeast and quickly.  They appeared in the sky near Orion (from my point of view) and vanished once they were across the sky between the handle of the Big Dipper and the horizon. As soon as the first one made it to that point, the next one came into view by Orion.  They flew in succession like this, one after the other, until nine had passed by.  This is the most I have seen during a sighting. Pretty amazing!;39.7306;-122.2586
