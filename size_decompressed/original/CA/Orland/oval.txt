Two lighted objects interact in night sky.;2009-03-17 21:00:00;4 minutes;Two lighted objects interact in night sky. My son and I were outside in our driveway at approx. 9pm when I noticed some things in the night sky.   One was a seemingly oval object with numerous multi-colored lights on it, all flashing quickly and sporadically and changing colors as they did.  The second looked like a single red light.  They were both slowly flying south away from us maybe 20-30 degrees above horizon. I had my son run in the house to get my boyfriend and my other son to come out and see.  As we all watched, they continued moving south and the red light flew towards the other multiple lighted object until it looked like they would collide.  At that point, the red light object instantly became an oval object with numerous multi-colored, sporadically flashing lights just the same as the other.  When that happened, it began flying eastward away from the first object as they both continued moving south.  We watched until they were out of view.;39.7306;-122.2586
