When all o;2006-10-09 22:30:00;5 seconds;I was traveling North bound on I-5, with a terrific view of the horizon, flat land. I-5 runs North/South through california. When all of a sudden I noticed a fireball, which appeared to be traveling straight down, multi-colored and leave a long tail. It only appeared for 5 secs or so. It was also in direct line of the interstate, as if it landed somewhere on the road. Now this could have been between my location and say redding, ca, 100 miles away. Or it could have been way up north past oregon or even wash. One more thing this fireball was much much larger than your falling star, which where I live I have a great view of.
