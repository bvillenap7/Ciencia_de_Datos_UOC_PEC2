Red flashing lights hovering over a body of water.;2005-01-11 22:00:00;at least 10 Min;Red flashing lights hovering over a body of water. We live in a small farming community, there is a three mile strait away between our town and the next.  We were driving out to a friends house when over a canal we observed between 6 and 8 red lights in an almost strait, yet the rim of something round looking, line - hovering.  The lights are not there normally and were flashing one at a time. It was visable almost the whole drive and until we entered our friends home. No sounds came from the object. It looked like it was about a mile away over a water-way that is a run off of the sacramento river.  There was a car ahead of us that may have also witnessed the lights.  We didn't have a camera with us or eles we would have taken pictures to send you.  We are friends that drive  this road almost daily.  We are both students at a near by college. my friend is a former military member. This is not the first time we have seen things before and have had a local sheriff's officer verified or at the least acknwoledged past sightings.;39.0138;-122.0274
