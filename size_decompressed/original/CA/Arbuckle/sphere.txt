Quiet floating balls. Reflecting sun light.;2014-01-23 17:30:00;20 minutes;Quiet floating balls. Reflecting sun light. Right at sundown I went to view Mercury and I looked in sky and saw 7 Venus size lights in the air.They were all in a scattered formation.  Not moving at all.  They were reflecting the sun and immediatly stopped glowing when sun was gone.  This tells me they were low. Balloons of some sort..  I. Got a feeling of fear though.  I believe these are same objects of the Marysville Ca. Report..;39.0138;-122.0274
