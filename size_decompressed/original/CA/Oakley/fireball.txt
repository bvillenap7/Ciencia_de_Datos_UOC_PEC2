Three large, glowing, orange lights flying in the night sky in Oakley California;2012-01-13 23:04:00;5 minutes;Three large, glowing, orange lights flying in the night sky in Oakley, California We saw three fireball colored crafts flying towards us in the night sky.  They flew together in a rectangular formation glowing bright amber/orange.   As they flew above our heads the two objects on each side slowly vanished.  The single craft continued to fly for approximately 10 seconds more and also just vanished before our eyes.   The most bizarre thing I have ever seen in.  I believed in UFO's before to a degree but now.........I absolutely do!  A friend got the beginning of it on tape on his cell phone.  Doesn't even begin to describe what we saw with our own eyes!;37.9935;-121.7015
Four red-orange balls of light seen over Oakley, CA.;2013-11-30 18:30:00;10 minutes;Four red-orange balls of light seen over Oakley, CA.  It was a clear night tonight as I was driving home from work and looked out my window to see four glowing red-orange lights all spaced out from each other two being lower and two being higher.   I usually look out as I am driving and check out the night sky, so seeing something like this was an unusual sight.  They were very far apart and at four different heights.  I arrived at my house and looked outside to see they had moved.  The lights seemed to get brighter and dimmer as I viewed them but sporadically like burning orbs.  They made no sound. The lights began to hover and move towards each other. They flickered out and disappeared for five minutes and then mysteriously came into view as quickly as they disappeared.   The four orbs hovered for two minutes and then came close together and made a “Z” like formation.  They then moved into a “V” formation and hovered upwards a bit.  They flickered out of view after about three minutes of there reappearance. I made my family come out and watch the orbs with me there were five of us who witnessed this in total. Something I really want to emphasize is they were hovering.  It did not move like an airplane, balloon, or anything I had seen before.  They were four glowing balls of light that had the control to stay in one place or hover whenever they chose as well as maneuver into different formations….  As of now I have no explanation of what they could have possibly been.  I have never seen such a thing in my life.

7 fireball like objects.;2013-11-30 18:30:00;10 minutes;7 fireball like objects. I was leaving my home and in a car with 4 others.  I looked up and there was a bright light and almost looking like a fire ball, we stopped and looked there were 6 right behind that one.  You could see some of them still for a little bit and then they would start moving very slowly, then disappear.  They were as high as a plane maybe even higher and very very bright.;37.9935;-121.7015
