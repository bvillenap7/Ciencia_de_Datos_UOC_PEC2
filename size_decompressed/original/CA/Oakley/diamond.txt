Two large stationary diamond shaped bright white lights observed in sky facing West, one light appeared Larger  than the other.  Attempted to photograph with zoom digital camera, and even though objected were easily seen in cameraâ€™s viewfinder, and zoom is able to enlarge object making it appear to be the size of the moon, the object disappears in photo completely.  Second digital camera is able to capture it in a photo (although the zoom is not as close) the object is captured with a motion trail following it in a circular motion. Objects were then covered by a blanket of strange looking clouds. The clouds looked very unnatural stretching across the width of the sky having a perfect straight edge. When clouds moved out of way, the two bright lights had disappeared.;37.9935;-121.7015
