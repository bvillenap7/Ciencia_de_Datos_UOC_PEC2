The outer spheres move in to the midle and back then rotating to the left and they repeated the pattern. This was very syncrinized motion.  Size:  About 80 feet high approximately 10 ft. apart.  As I walked toward my driveway it moved with me.  There was no sound. I thought this to be really strange and I called my husband on the phone, called my daughter to come out and witness this.

The area of movement was described as 12'x12'.  The opservation was made at a point almost directly under the spheres. The event occured in our front yard 50' from the house.  The objects were still present when the wittnesses retreated to the house in fear. At the exact time and date as noted I recieved a cell phone call from my wife  She described the above phenomenon.  I instructed her to terminate the call and use her cell phone camera. Two images were recorded  One motion and one still.  During the siting my wife went into the house to get my 13 year old daughter to wittness.  My wife stated the 4 spheres followed her as she walked down our driveway.  The next day I interviewed my wife and learned the following:  The objects produced no sound. The objects were brightly aluminated and nearly perfect vivid spheres. There was no beam of light or reflection of light from the ground or adjacent structures. The following  day at approximately 10 AM a late model SUV blue in color stopped in front of our house.  The occupant, a caucasian male approximately 60 years of age  took several pictures of the area.  The location is on a private, easement dead end dirt road.  The person did see me observing. The weather was heavy rain and wind.  None of the adjacent houses which are on 1 to 3 acre lots are for sale or in default. The images were taken from an Apple I Phone and will be sent via my e mail address to ufocntr@nwlink.com;37.9935;-121.7015
