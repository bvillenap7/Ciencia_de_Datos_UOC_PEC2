2 lights merge, then disappear.;2003-06-08 22:00:00;5 minutes;2 lights merge, then disappear. First off, I would like to say that I know how planes in the night sky look and behave since I live near local and intl. aiports. But on to what I saw. At around 10pm PST, I was driving due west through Knightsen to Oakley. I was on farming roads, so I had a pretty unobstructed view of what I saw. So, as I'm looking at the West horizon around Mt. Diablo, I see this fairly large orange light that was stationary off in the distance. I keep looking at it while i'm driving, and then a I see a smaller orange light off to the right of the first larger orange, and its making it way towards the bigger light. The smaller light continues to go toward the bigger light until they merge together. The bigger light completely envelops the small one. At this point i'm excited because i've never seen anything like this before. so I keep watching waiting for the smaller light to emerge signifying that it is just an airplane, but it doesnt. at that point trees cut off my vision of the event, and a few minutes later when i regain my viewpoint, the lights are gone. don't what it was. i'm just hoping that someone else might have saw something as well.;37.9935;-121.7015

I have observed satellites in the past and assumed this was a satellite as well, until I noticed the light was flashing and changing colors,  I have never seen anything like it. when I say multi colored it looked like a rainbow at times then seems to go from one color to the next then back to multi colors.  It flew from the shadowed face into the light very slowly, then in the light it was still for maybe one second, then moved backward toward a slightly different angle.  I tried to follow it but it simply disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));37.9935;-121.7015
