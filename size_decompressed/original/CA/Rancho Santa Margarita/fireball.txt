Large, slowly moving orange fireball along RSM Blvd.;2014-06-18 23:00:00;15-20 minutes;Large, slowly moving orange fireball along RSM Blvd. I was driving home late from work (around 11:00 PM), when something caught my eye off to the right.  I had just crossed over the Alicia Parkway bridge that leads to Rancho Santa Margarita Blvd. to make a right turn, and there it was: a glowing orange ball of light.  It was moving at a steady pace, parallel with the road I was on, so I decided to follow it.   The object was large- I estimate it must have been the size of a house.  I signaled it with my headlights. I pulled over to view it and kept following it as far as I could, until it passed over the hills and was out of sight.  I probably frightened the car in front of me, because I was following them and flashing my brights until they turned into a residential neighborhood.  At that point, the UFO was out of sight, so I turned and drove home. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.6527;-117.5953
