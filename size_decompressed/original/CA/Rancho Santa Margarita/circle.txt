We called my brother to tell him to look outside, by the time he looked out side it was gone.  We too are wondering what that was, could this be a  UFO???;33.6527;-117.5953
was at the neiborhood with a few friends and sighed a round ufo.;2009-07-17 21:30:00;approx. 15 min.;was at the neiborhood with a few friends and sighed a round ufo. I was at the neiborhood pool with 2 of my friends and my sister. We were having a conversation when my sister said, “wow! What’s that up in the sky?” so my friends and I turned around and saw a flying object in the distance. It must have been about 3 or 4 miles away. But it was a very clear night with no clouds and you could se stars. But it was definitely not a star. What we say was a round, spinning object zipping throughout the sky.  It had neon coloring and the lights would switch colors. It started with neon blue, then it turned into neon green, then a bright white light and then it went dark. We were kind of confused and it lighted back up and was a deep red color. When it was the red color, it was flashing. It went out again and then it started doing the color cycle again. there was a ring around the object and thats where the lights were going around. in the middle, it was pitch black.It was then out of our point of view because of houses and some trees. We came home, and my sister looked out her window just to see if it would pop up again, and soon after it did come up and then it disappeared. That was the last of it. When we were coming home from the pool, we had some weird power outage types of things. The lights were going out on our street and when we got home, the lights in our living room were being kind of funky and were going on and off and like flickering. We did not have anymore problems after that.;33.6527;-117.5953

6 bright, red-orange lights were spotted and mysteriously vanished a few seconds later.;2014-06-25 23:30:00;3-7 seconds;6 bright, red-orange lights were spotted and mysteriously vanished a few seconds later. Orange County, California-   	My Dad and I were driving home around 11:30 pm. Suddenly, he said, “Look up and tell me what you see.”  As I was searching the sky, he swerved into a parking lot to get a better look and my dad looked for them again, but they were gone. He saw about six bright, red-orange, circular lights grouped together but not in any particular pattern.  They were bigger than stars.  My dad is a pilot and is constantly looking up, instinctively searching for planes and observing what the weather is like, so of course, it was not unusual for him to be seeing the sky.  Shortly after the sighting we went to report it and discovered the very recent other sightings of lights with the exact same description, many in Southern California.  First time is chance, second is a coincidence, but over 210 sightings is a pattern.  Weird.;33.6527;-117.5953
