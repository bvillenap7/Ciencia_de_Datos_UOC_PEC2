drifting small white light - no noise;2007-06-21 21:30:00;30-45 seconds;drifting small white light - no noise some time between 9:00 and 10:00 pm I saw a small white light at about the same altitude as an airliner would fly, perhaps even lower. The craft was silent and had no blinking lights.  It almost appeared to be drifting in a zig-zagging motion. From the time I spotted it off in the distance, to the time it passed over my roof, I would say only lasted about 30 - 45 seconds.

Moving bright lights moving in all directions in Southern California.;2008-10-17 21:30:00;1 hour;Moving bright lights moving in all directions in Southern California. At 9:30 P.M. me and my friend were called to come outside by my friends Dad. We looked into the sky and there were 2 lights bigger and brighter than stars. These white lights were able to change how bright and dim they were. They also had a red light on it that would quickly blink on occasion. These lights were moving in all directions and were able to change direction very fast. These lights would go in circles around each other and drift apart. They would go as high as the moon was and drop to behind the Mountains in about 1 and one half seconds. When planes flew by these lights would dim so much that they could not be seen and as soon as the plane was gone the light would go up and start shining. During this time my cell phone was not able to call or receive calls or messages. My friends house phone that he brought was also having difficulty calling people. The background of this scene was a California suburb with many trees and Mountains in the background. There was also a grey hazy in the sky around this time but it was not very close to the lights. There was at least 11 witnesses and one of them was a police officer.;33.6527;-117.5953

We do not believe they are flares.  Possibly hoaxers with floating chinese lanterns.;33.6527;-117.5953
