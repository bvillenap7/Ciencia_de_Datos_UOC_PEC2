Formation of 2 unusually saturated, deep ruby-red blinking lights flew silently across entire sky in under 4 minutes. ((anonymous));2017-12-10 22:50:00;4 minutes;Formation of two unusually saturated, deep ruby-red blinking lights flew silently across entire sky at high altitude in under 4 minutes A formation of 2 objects (1 pulsing deep ruby-red light at a higher altitude, and 1 pulsing deep ruby-red light that also had a periodic phosphorescent strobe, following behind and below the first object) were observed moving from the southeast to the northwest, seemingly at a high altitude or otherwise totally silently, and at a very high rate of speed, traversing the whole visible sky from horizon to horizon in about 4 minutes.  No green or white navigation lights were observed on or to the side of either object, and the phosphorescent strobe on the second object seemed to be oriented vertically above it rather than on a wing or tail, and was itself comprised seemingly of 3 or 4 vertically clustered strobing points of light.  Despite the apparent altitude, the lights were very large. A commercial airliner was observed crossing near the flightpath of the 2 objects at a similar altitude on a perpendicular heading.  The appearance of the airliner in the sky was strikingly different from the 2 silent objects: by comparison, the objects' lights were much deeper and their colors more saturated than the airliner's obviously electrical lights.

Seen a row of these lights going quietly thru the night sky, called another bystander to witness as well.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-01 21:10:00;2 minutes;Seen a row of these lights going quietly thru the night sky, called another bystander to witness as well.;33.6527;-117.5953
