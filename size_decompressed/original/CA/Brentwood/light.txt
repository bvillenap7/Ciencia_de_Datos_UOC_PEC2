Bright light in the N.W. sky comming towards eath, then shooting back into space;2004-07-17 02:55:00;30 seconds;Bright light in the N.W. sky comming towards eath, then shooting back into space Bright light against a stary sky, looked like a bright planet at first then began moving towards earth. then thought it was a plane at 30k ft. then all of a sudden it changed direction real fast and the bright light turned dim as it took off into space, i mean it turned like imediate change of direction. from the ground it looked like a v-shape change of direction. I started to ponder what it was, and a meteor would not have been able to be bounced offthe atmospher like that, this thing was bright maybe due to it comming into the ozone or something but then shot right back into space. from what i know and understand of today's technology. no natrual thing could monuver like that. Ialso read on another web site on date - 7-08-04 an almost exact description of what i just posted here!!;37.9285;-121.6881

Two bright white lights travel quickly over Brentwood, Ca.;2005-09-22 01:45:00;2 minutes;Two bright white lights travel quickly over Brentwood, Ca. Last night, while smoking a cigarette, I went for one of my usual late-night/early-morning walks.  I was walking east and as I turned the corner I saw, through some trees, what at first glance I thought was an airplane heading towards me.  Once I had a clearer view I saw two nonflashing bright white lights, arranged horizantaly, rather low in the sky.  They were clearly connected to a craft though I could not discern its shape.  The craft travelled north by north-west until it was out of sight.  The movements of the craft were unlike anything I've ever seen in the sky.  It kept a general course, but it would visibly accelerate and decelerate while veering side to side.;37.9285;-121.6881
Bright Light fades away within 30 seconds.;2011-01-09 19:10:00;30 seconds;Bright Light fades away within 30 seconds. January 9th, 2011,  at 7:10-7:11 pm  I exited my garage which faces East and looked South at about a 30 degree angle up  And saw a very bright light.   It was as if a spotlight were trying to get your attention,  It was that bright, brighter than the brightest star in the sky by about 10 times. I exited the garage and walked in that direction, by the time I walked past 3 garbage Cans, (the recycling, the yard waste and the actual garbage can) it started to fadeâ€¦ It got smaller then within 2 more feet it had disappeared.    There were no stars in That area, and it was totally dark.   I called my husband to tell him at 7:13 (as noted On his cell phone) and even then, still total darkness, no stars. About 4 minutes later I saw a small plane fly east to west in the same area, definitely Looked like a plane, had a blinking light and was flying slower than this object Disappeared.   I have never seen anything like this. My location is Northern California, Bay Area. Thank You.;37.9285;-121.6881
