UFO in the EAST BAY,CA 4/07/2008?;2008-04-07 21:00:00;15 mins;UFO in the EAST BAY,CA 4/07/2008? Huge Boomerang shaped gliding silently about 30 feet from the roof of my house. I thought it was a glider but theres no light and it is 30X the size of a regular glider and it is gliding at night. No sound, no light. I just saw it by accident while star gazing looking towards the Big Deeper. It was green and black in color. Maybe a stealth bomber? but flying way too low and has a different shape. Anyone else had seen this object on monday night in the East Bay area of California?;37.9285;-121.6881

Three aircrafts, boomerang shaped, silent.;2018-06-27 00:07:00;~7 minutes;Three aircrafts, boomerang shaped, silent. I was driving home when I saw three bright lights in the distance, sort of just sitting there.  I pulled over by a small clearing so I could watch them and see what happened.  The three lights then got closer to me and I assumed maybe it was a set of drones because of how quiet they were.  They ended up flying right over me almost in formation, but they were still silent. I could then see that they were some sort of aircraft and a boomerang or triangular shape with lights on them, they seemed brighter in the distance.  I filmed them and sent them out on snapchat to a few people, but because of my excitement I only saved two of the multiple videos.  They then flew away as quickly as they came, and as silently as they came.;37.9285;-121.6881
