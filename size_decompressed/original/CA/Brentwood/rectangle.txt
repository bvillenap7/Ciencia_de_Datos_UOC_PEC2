As I looked closer I called out the other people in my home to see the odd lights. by the time everyone came out the lights had floated very close to us . They all seemed to be headed in the same direction. As they passed overhead it seembed that some embers seemed to fall to the ground and shortly later the lights faded in the distance and they dissapeared. I went inside to get my video camera and when I came back their was two more lights headed in the same pattern. I started videoing the phenomenon and one of the lights floated directly overhead not more than a hundred feet above us. My wife and friends said the light was at the base of the object and the rest of the shape was translucent kinda like a tapered rectangle with a round base. As it passed over my friend yelled out to the object to see if it was someone parachuting at night. The object passed over our house and crossed over the street. It looked like it was going to land. We took off after it in my truck but could not find it.But we do have a video of the whole thing.;37.9285;-121.6881
