In the distance we all witnessed an object fade in and out of the sky.  As it traveled in a southern direction at a slow pase it would fade in and out of sight not because of the clouds but possibly due to the reflection of the sun hitting the outer part of the object.  Reports where made to local law inforcement offices but no one knew what the object was.  It was to high to be a blimp and moving to slow to be a plane.  I also submitted a picture to the Merced Sun Star.;37.0673818181818;-120.860641818182
