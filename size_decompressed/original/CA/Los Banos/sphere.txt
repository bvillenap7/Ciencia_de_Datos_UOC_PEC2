Eight visible stationary orbs seen in the western sky.;2014-09-19 19:15:00;10;Eight visible stationary orbs seen in the western sky. The 8 objects were high above the horizon in the western sky and were noticeable once the sun set below the horizon.  What started out to be bright white in color eventually turned orange as the sun completed its setting.  In effect, they just appeared in the sky (west-northwest direction from my position in Los Banos).  The objects remained in the sky for about ten minutes changing color and dimming in intensity in the process.  No time during the observation did the objects move in the sky.  The objects were spread out in a wide plus-like formation.  Small amount of clouds but no evening stars visible yet at the time of observation to confuse what was being observed.;37.0673818181818;-120.860641818182
Small glowing orb spinning feet from me.;2015-04-03 22:00:00;20 seconds;Small glowing orb spinning feet from me. As a I was out for a walk with my niece and my son.  I and my niece noticed a glowing ball in the middle of the street.  It gave off a reddish gold color and was spinning but was completely silent.   It caught me off guard me and my niece were afraid of it.   It was about three feet in diameter.   As I stared at it, it disappeared after 15 or 20 seconds.;37.0673818181818;-120.860641818182
