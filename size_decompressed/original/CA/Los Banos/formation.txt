Moving V shaped “star” formation;2020-11-25 05:40:00;30;Moving V shaped “star” formation When we were driving down Wild Duck Rd in Los Banos, CA to get to our duck blind I saw a flash in the sky and then a trail of space dust left behind, shortly after I saw multiple shooting/falling stars. Once we got to our parking spot I saw a V shaped “star formation” made up of “5 stars” I looked  away for less than a minute to check my phone for the name of the constellation and when I looked up at the same location again I no longer saw the V formation instead I saw 3 lights that looked like stars moving apart from each other each going different directions. One light was moving east, one North and the other South. The sky was very clear so I tracked them until they were no longer visible. The other 2 lights remained in the sky around the same area where I spotted the V formation and had lights that flashed around it kind of like Christmas lights except they were only red/lwhite colored they were no longer visible as the sun came up.;37.0673818181818;-120.860641818182
