Large orange and yellow dome in Los Banos California.;2010-06-16 01:50:00;5 minutes;Large orange and yellow dome in Los Banos California. We were driving down I-5 south through Los Banos California on 6/16/10, at around 1:50 am.  We saw what appeared to be a large orange and yellow dome approximately three hundred yards away.  The dome seemed to be about the size of a house and levitated about fifty stories high, then became a very small dot and disappeared.   The duration of the sighting was about thirty seconds to a minute.  This was definitely like no other aircraft I've ever seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report telephoned the Hotline, during the early morning hours.  We attempted to return the call, but unsuccessfully.  PD));37.0673818181818;-120.860641818182
