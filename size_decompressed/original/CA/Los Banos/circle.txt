I first thought it was a plane but it slowly did a u turn and i thought that was wierd. I said to my friend, look a ufo.  She was reading my On Star manual and didn't look at first.  When i said it a second time she was like, oh my gosh, what is that. I should have pulled over because i was so amazed at this UFO that i wasn't keeping my eye on the road.;37.0673818181818;-120.860641818182

We saw three spherical-shaped, bright white lights erratically flying over a field adjacent to interstate 5 in approximately Los Banos,;2013-05-31 22:20:00;3 minutes;We saw three spherical-shaped, bright white lights erratically flying over a field adjacent to interstate 5 in approximately Los Banos, Driving south on Interstate 5 from Sacramento to Los Angeles my husband looked over in a field to the east and saw one bright white, sphere shaped orb flying in an erratic pattern.   About five minutes later he saw three of them, again to the east side of the freeway, flying north.  They were not in formation, they bounced erratically, darting almost like moths to a lightbulb, he said.  I was watching a movie on my iPad, so did not see all he saw, but he tapped me on the leg and asked me to look and I saw them for about a minute before we passed them.   The lights were very bright and round spherical shaped.   As we passed them I looked back at them.  There were no red signal lights or running lights to indicate it was an approved airplane, etc., and the erratic way these lights darted place to place were unlike any airplane or helicopter would be capable of.
