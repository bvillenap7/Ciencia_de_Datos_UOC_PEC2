Pacheco Pass/Los Banos Object;2012-04-16 08:00:00;10 minutes;Pacheco Pass/Los Banos Object Regarding UFO siting on Pacheco Pass, near Los Banos California  At approx 8am on Monday April 16, 2012, my husband and I were traveling westbound on Hwy 152 over what is known as Pacheco Pass.  After observing several vehicles pulled over and people out of their cars staring up to the sky we decided to see what they were all looking at.  We asked a nearby driver what they were looking at and he pointed up to a dark speck up in the sky.  Traveling westbound on 152 the object was on the south of highway.  It just hovered in the same spot and did not appear to move.  I pulled out my camera which has a 30 X zoom and snapped several pictures of it, which I have emailed in already. We stood there about 10 minutes total and then drove on.;37.0673818181818;-120.860641818182
