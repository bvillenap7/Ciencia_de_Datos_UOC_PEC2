3 Bright lights along highway 152 east of Los Banos, very close to the ground.;2011-07-18 11:45:00;3-5 minutes;3 Bright lights along highway 152 east of Los Banos, very close to the ground I was driving along highway 152 traveling west, when approximately 10-15 miles outside of the town of Los Banos, I saw a green bright light fly across the highway a mile in front of me.  As it passed and it turned and looked as if two white lights had been shot off out of it almost. It proceeded to to turn make a tight turn to pass over the highway once again.  It passed over the highway and then proceeded to drop very low to the ground, still continuing forward.  Low enough that I could remember seeing the ground lit up from its light.  The reflection of the light allowed me to see what I believe was that the lights where actually connected to one another (i.e., that the craft was a bigger object with these three lights at the points).   After flying low to the ground for a short distance it gently curved back up and achieved more alluded  ((sic. Altitude?)) and turned left. I was driving along 152 heading west, and all this occurred in the span of about 3-5 minutes.  I could still see the craft in my side view/rear view mirrors, as I continued down 152.  The object looked to be staying in the same area.   I was in the car by myself at the time, but there were other drivers both east and west bound along 152. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that this was a nighttime sighting, but we can't be certain.  We have sent the source an e-message, requesting confirmation about the time.

Triangular UFO sighted near Los Banos on Hwy 5 in CA on 6/27/12 at 2:15AM;2012-06-27 02:15:00;5 minutes;Triangular UFO sighted near Los Banos on Hwy 5 in CA on 6/27/12 at 2:15AM My graduate student was driving home from Las Vegas to San Francisco on 6/26/12, and arrived at a few miles before exit 379 (Shield Ave) on Hwy 5 around 2:15AM (on 6/27/12) when three of us in the car saw this triangular shape flying object about 1/2 mi in front at 3 o'clock position. This UFO has 3 extremely bright headlights, not really flying, but gliding like a huge kite in the sky. The three lights were connected by some beefy metal frame (?) with no visible cockpit. At times it followed us from behind, right above the freeway, then along side to the east of the freeway, at no more than 300 yards away from us, hovering at our driving speed of ~80mph.  We were the only sedan on the freeway, but there were plenty of trucks on lane #2. I am sure that many of the truckers have also seen it,   The three lights were extremely bright, unlike LED or halogen or any light source that I am familiar with, and would hover to the front of us at probably 2-300mph, then immediately turn 180 degree, shine the three lights directly at us, and traveling in reverse at 80-90mph.  It would than just glide over to the east of us, and while hovering next to us, it was completely silent, unlike a regular plane or jet, which would have made a loud jet engine noise.  The three lights later turned into nine smaller lights with red/orange/blue/greenish color, all moving in uniform, as if it splits into three UFO. It would then immediately merge back into 3 large bright lights, hovering mainly on the east side of hwy 5.  The UFO flew next to us for almost five miles until we reached W Ness Ave (exit 385) before it flew south and disappeared into the darkness.   Wish we had a video camera.  After seeing other similar youtube videos, I am glad we were not seeing things.;37.0673818181818;-120.860641818182

3 lights turned into flying triangle object.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-24 22:50:00;2 minutes;3 lights turned into flying triangle object We were driving on highway 152, coming from San Fransico heading home to Porterville around 10:50 pm.  I was the passenger and my hubbybtge driver when he spotted 3 lights pretty low I thought they were drones or kids plying with some type of flying planes, the lights were not big they had to be the size of a cantaloupe each and 10 feet in the air, then all of a sudden the lights disappear and my husband who is driving can no longer see but me as the passenger can turn and since there was a full moon I can see the shape of a triangleular plane but no lights are on and no sound and it starts moving and as we continue to be driving I can see it moving in the back and then it flies always at a low height and it’s gone.  I can’t believe i even looked up this site I don’t know what I saw last night I just know that it’s something I never thought i could see and I’m in amazement.
