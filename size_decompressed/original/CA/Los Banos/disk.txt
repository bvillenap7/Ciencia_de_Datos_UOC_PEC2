PD));2004-03-10 18:00:00;45 min;Sitting stationary  the pulsating lights looked like a heart beat. On March 10 at 6pm I sat down at my desk in my living room,waiting for dinner to cook.I looked out a sliding glass door which faces my desk.I noticed the brightest light I had ever saw about a 1/4 of a mileaway in the sky.s I watched it I noticed the light was pulsating,in the the very center of it were chasing red light going completely around the craft.I grabbed my viedo camera and began taping it.after about 15 min of filming it my camera lost power.I ran into the house and put the battery on the charger.I sat and watched the light for another 30 min sitting stationary.I reached over and grabed the battery from the charger and looked back it was gone.I quickly ran out the door to see it fly west over the foothills about 5 miles from my house.After viewing the tape over and over I could see what appears to be a shadow around the light,a disk shape shadow as though that were the body.I never called anyone on this night but as the days wore on I began to wonder if anyone else seen it as I live around alot of homes.On MondayMarch 14 I called the local newspaper and inquired whether anyone had called in about these lights,no one had so I told my story and it was placed the local paper on Friday.On Sunday night a lady called me from across town and told me she read the article in the paper and just wanted to let me know her and her husband had seen the same light while walking their dog one hour later than when I had taped it.The location they had seen it was about 2 miles north of my house.She described it as the same one I seen,the brightest light with chasing red lights in the center.She said it would zoom up very high,then zoom back down,this at a speed she had never seen.It disappeared right before our eye's as we watched it she said.Oh thank you I told her,my husband and grandchildren seen it but it just makes me feel better that they too had seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus is very prominent in the western sky, at present, and unless the witness saw TWO very bright objects in the western sky, we suspect she may have been looking at that planet.
