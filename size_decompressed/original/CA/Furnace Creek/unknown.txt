Mysterious red glow in the sky, brightest toward the horizon off to the Northeast.;1990-11-15 19:00:00;2 Hours;Mysterious red glow in the sky, brightest toward the horizon off to the Northeast. Every November my family and I would take a trip to Death Valley to meet up with relatives from Arizona and Oregon.  This particular trip had a surprise in store for me.  I'm not sure on the dates, but I was probably around 11 or 12 years old at the time.  After the desert sun went down I began to notice a red glow in the Northeast sky that seemed to be eminating from behind the mountains.  As the sky got darker, the glow got brighter and brighter.  It was a bright blood red.  The glow covered maybe an 8th of the sky and had no defined cut-off line, but instead faded from bright to normal sky color further up.  There were a few cumulus clouds in the sky silhouetted against the glow.  I remember being a little frightened by it.  The wierd thing was, noone else seemed to notice it.  My family was off somewhere else in the campground and when I asked them if they saw it, they said they hadn't.  As the night went on, the glow had all but faded away hours later.  Not sure what to make of it.  Aurora Borealis, weapons testing? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of five interesting reports from same witness.  PD));36.4672;-116.8937
