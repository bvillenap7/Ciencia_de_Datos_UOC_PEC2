I was taking out the trash when I heard a plane above. Looking up I saw i large circle and 3 smaller circles. at first thought these were skydivers from the plan I had heard. once the plane left I waited for the chutes to open. 8 minutes later a passenger jet came over at about 15 thousand feet. At that time I realized these circles were at a higher distance. So I ran to get my camera a olympic rebel. Viewing the circles through the lens gave me a closer picture of one large circle and three small moving around the larger circle. I proceeded to take some pictures and the camera did not work! I then continued to watch and one by one the smaller circles merged with the larger circle. Once they were all merged the larger circle went straight up and disappeared. I was completely astonished as to what I saw. That is all.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
Four round, lit craft flyhing in a low, v formation over Elk Grove, Ca.;2011-07-04 22:25:00;8 - 10 seconds;Four round, lit craft flyhing in a low, v formation over Elk Grove, Ca. I am a 59 year old IT specialist.  I have never seen and reported a UFO before.  This is the 4th of July.   The fireworks ended about 9:50 PM (and were a long way away and not visible at all where we were due to the height of the houses and the distance to the fireworks (2 to 3 miles).   At 10:25 PM, I was in the pool with my girlfriend and I was looking up at the sky saying how great it is in California to see meteorite showers and other such things in the night sky because the sky is always clear in the summer in California (as opposed to Illinois where I lived all my life (58 years) until this past October).  Just after I stated how clear it was and almost on cue, four round, glowing objects came into my line of sight out of the southwest, heading northeast.  They seemed fairly small, and flying fairly low similar to the altitude of a single engine plane flying low.  They almost looked like four searchlights shining on a thin cloud, but the stars were out, and there was not a cloud in the sky.  They were fairly dim, but brighter in the center, and rimmed with a soft glow around each.  They were in a v formation, but there were three on the right, with one on the left. I am aware of the v shaped sightings that seem to be the underbelly lights of a larger craft.  These did not seem to be that since there was only one light on one side, and they were not flying slow.   They continued at a steady rate, much faster than any prop or jet plane would fly, and in a straight line. I watched for about 8 to 10 seconds from when they appeared in my line of sight until they went out of sight. I am not sure at this point, because they were not really visible, but they may have dispersed from the formation, because as I was watching the point where they went out of sight I caught a glimpse of a streak off to the northwest of where they disappeared that flashed for just a second. After seeing them for 2 - 3 seconds and realizing they were somethin! g special, I pointed to them right in front of my girlfriend's! face and emphatically said, Look! Look!, and she was able to see them for about 5 seconds or so. She has always been a scoffer and has made fun of me watching Ancient Astronauts and other UFO related shows on TV.   She was a little shocked, a little scared, and would love to tell someone what she saw.  I think the incident changed her mind.  I hope we were not the only ones to observe this. I am thinking there were many people looking up at the time due to backyard fireworks.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
6 bright star like objects moving fast in the night sky;2013-07-10 21:45:00;20 minutes;6 bright star like objects moving fast in the night sky At approximately 9:45pm on 7-10-2013 I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and make a phone call and looked up to admire the night sky when I saw what I thought at first was a satellite heading  South East in the night sky.   I noticed the “satellite was much brighter than others I had seen and was also traveling much faster than others I have witnessed.  Just as I was thinking all of this it quickly changed directions and began travelling south while picking up speed.  It was very bright and the light pulsated twice before coming to a complete stop then lit up extremely bright then disappeared.   Just as it disappeared two more similar objects appeared in the sky but this time they were headed from the west heading east and were flying one directly behind the other but displaying the same flight pattern as the previous object.   These objects were also quite fast and ended changing direction again to end up in the same approximate location as the first object! when they too came to a complete stop, lit up extremely bright then disappeared.  All together there were six objects all identical to the first and all stopped at the same approximate location in the night sky before lighting up very bright then disappearing.   I’m not sure what these objects were but they definitely were not conventional aircraft and definitely were not satellites.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
Bright star like object moves fast before stopping and immiting bright white light;2013-07-12 22:10:00;1 minute;Bright star like object moves fast before stopping and immiting bright white light I have been witnessing frequent unexplained phenomenon since 4th of July 2013 in the sky above Elk Grove, Ca.  It started in Elk Grove Park while watching the fireworks when a family sitting on the lawn area in front of my family began pointing up to the sky before the fireworks started.  We looked up and saw the same type of unexplained phenomenon that I have been seeing virtually every night since.   On this particular night 7-12-2012 after seeing 6 flying orbs the previous night I stepped into my back yard at approximately 10 pm anticipating to see some more action and again they appeared.   I looked up and initially saw only stars then out of nowhere what at first appeared to be a satellite grew very bright with an intense white light as it moved in a North East Direction.   The moving light pulsed several times before dimming out then disappearing.  4 minutes later what at first appeared to look like an airplane due to a much lower altitude appeared from ! the south and as it flew overhead lit up several times almost as if it were pulsing with an immense bright white light.  It generated  no sound as it flew over and right when it was directly overhead it came to a slow crawl as it lit up immensely again  as if it recognized I was looking at it.  I took out my video phone but was unable to catch it on video due to the low battery on the phone.  After stopping and lighting up extremely bright it continued on its original path before disappearing out of sight.   Due to all the recent activity around here I am beginning to wonder if these crafts are related to Beale AFB as they seem to travel to and from the general direction of the base.   These are definitely not conventional aircraft or satellites.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
Bright star like circular object shoots across the sky at amazing speed;2013-07-31 22:34:00;5 seconds;Bright star like circular object shoots across the sky at amazing speed After witnessing several sightings this month I was watching the sky from my backyard for a few minutes before going to bed.  Once again I saw something different than I've seen before and something I cannot explain.  While looking towad the South East a bright star like object appeared from no where and grew extremly bright then shot across the sky heading Northe West at an amazing speed.  It left a trail behind it as it went obver head.  It looked almost like a meteor only it was flying straight across the sky instead of travelling downward.  It kind of looked like it could be a missle almost since it travelled so fast but it made no sound whatsoever.  It lasted about 5-6 seconds before it dissapeared out of site.  It was NOT a falling star or a meteor so I am calling it a ufo.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
Fast moving star like ufo stops its course, lights up bright then shoots straight up.;2014-06-30 22:03:00;30 seconds;Fast moving star like ufo stops its course, lights up bright then shoots straight up. Sitting outside watching the night sky when I noticed what I thought at first was a sattelite.  This thing appeared and was moving rather swiftly toward the South West.  The altitude seemed pretty high which is why I thought at first it was a sattelite but it was moving too fast.  A few seconds after I began watching this thing it stopped, zig zagged back and forth a couple times then lit up extremley bright with a very white light which made it also appear larger in size.  Right after it lit up all bright it changed direction and quickly started heading back in the direction it had just came from, stopped again then shot straight up and out of sight at incredible speed.  This was absolutly not a sattelite or any conventional air craft.  It was also silent and made no noise.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
2 high altitude objects perform amazing maneuvers.;2016-07-04 21:00:00;1 minute;2 high altitude objects perform amazing maneuvers 4th of July watching the fireworks we were naturally looking at the sky.  I witnessed a bright object that resembled a satellite crossing the sky at a high rate of speed at a very high altitude.  The object suddenly came to a complete stop before scooting off and stopping again in sudden short bursts.  It made several sudden 90 degree turns and twists as it continued to move in short bursts of speed.  It then stopped the erratic movements and sped off at a very high speed across the sky and out of site.   Approximately 30 seconds after the first object disappeared out of site a second object that looked identical to the first object appeared from the same general location as the first object and performed a very similar series of short burst maneuvers as the first as it travelled the same path and like the first object eventually disappeared out of site leaving myself and my fiancé baffled as to what we had witnessed.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
Strange lights over Central Valley, CA.;2016-11-16 23:00:00;10 minutes;Strange lights over Central Valley, CA First, one bright yellowish-white light pops up in sky, then quickly falls downward until stopping abruptly.  It hovered in place for about a minute until another bright circular light popped up close to it.  The second one hovered in place until a third popped up.  The three were in a triangle formation for about a minute.   Then the first one flew away.  The other two remained still until a fourth popped up.  All were the same color and size and brighter than airplane lights or stars.  They then vanished one by one.
