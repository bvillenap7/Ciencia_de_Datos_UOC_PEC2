The skies were completely blue.  We were on the stretch of I-5 where there was nothing around but fields of grass and farmland.  With this setting, there are no clouds and there were no tall buildings or city light. I think I saw a ((deleted)) UFO. So I'm driving and I'm just looking into the distance and I spot a really bright light in the sky.  At first I thought it was just a plane, but I've never seen a plane with that bright of a light during the daytime when the sun's still out, especially with how far it was.  Then I thought it was just a really bright star.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend and she saw it, too, and we joked that it was a shooting star.  I kept my eye on it because I was still puzzled at the fact I could see a star during the daytime in the bright blue sky. Then, all of a sudden, it was it turned sideways, and I couldn't see the light anymore, but I could see the side of it. Since it was far away, it just looked like a dot.  Then, with the blink of an eye, it was gone.  The dot was gone and the light was gone.  My girlfriend and I were confused. We were staring into the distant sky trying to spot the dot or the star we thought we saw, but it just wasn't there.  It was gone, like it was never there. My head hurts from trying to convince myself that it wasn't a UFO and trying to convince myself that it was.  I really think it was...

Multiple satellite-like craft with light beams over Elk Grove/Sacramento.;2014-07-04 23:00:00;15 minutes;Multiple satellite-like craft with light beams over Elk Grove/Sacramento. Was watching what I thought was a satellite, but shortly after I noticed it, it flashed a very bright flash (very eye catching if looking even slightly up).   I called three other adults on the patio to watch.  We watched it slowly cross above and it flashed a very bright flash again.  It did this only twice and began to fade away into the big dipper (south to north).   Suddenly, there was another trailing behind it.  Again it looked like a satellite on a straight course.  While watching this one it suddenly JUMPED ahead and caught up with the other one covering a vast space in the blink of an eye.   Then there was a third, then a fourth, then a fifth, then a sixth, in succession, spread out with many miles beteween them and all traveling south to north in the same line.  At times they stopped and displayed a bright light ray coming out of them in a search-like mode.  The light moved around.  It didn't just flash once.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449

The other night, we smelled smoke and went outside to look around in doing so I looked up at the sky and noticed a strange twinkling what I thought was a star, suddenly above shot a white light across the night sky.   My husband ran to get our binoculars and night vision goggles.  We started looking and saw a few twinkling spots and through the binoculars there was blue, green, red, orange lights flashing on what I assumed was a alien craft.   This evening we went outside and saw the same twinkling lights and as I looked I counted 11 crafts some of which the colors flashing brightly without any binoculars.  With binoculars and night vision goggles we could see all the lights, our neighbors also stood outside with us looking at the many crafts scattered across the night skies.   These crafts are very high in the skies sitting still as can be and completely silent.   There were a few helicopters and airplanes what I could only guess to be investigating what we are witnessing take place.  It's truly an incredible site to see the skies above covered in UFO's. I hope you find this information useful and I hope others have the pleasure of witnessing this amazing site as well. Thank You,  ((name deleted));38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
UFO does maneuvers in No. California sky.;2018-01-26 20:50:00;20-30 seconds;UFO does maneuvers in No. California sky. I was sitting on my back patio enjoying a cigar and watching the northern sky above Sacramento.  The sky in the distance was partially overcast.   I watched the periodic aircraft and then noticed one object with a red and yellow light moving slowly.  It was 10-15 degrees above the horizon.   Suddenly it picked up speed and then started making maneuvers in approx. 10 degrees of air space.  It would slow and speed up and then do complete reversals at hi speed.  It then dropped below my line of sight.   I might add that this object was in the far distance as it went behind clouds periodically.
