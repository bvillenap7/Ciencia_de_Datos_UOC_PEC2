I observed the craft fly through or above one cloud.   I tried to show my 16-year old son, but it was almost invisable and I lost sight of it after seeing it only three times as it moved north in a straight line. I am a retired deputy sheriff.  I have lived in Elk Grove for almost 30 years.  I have always been interested in aircraft.  When I was assigned to Sacramento's Metro Airport, I became very familiar with the many different models of commercial, military, and private airplanes and jet aircraft.  I still watch aircraft flying high over the Sacramento/Elk Grove area.  I can usually identify the model of aircraft (747s, DC10s, 727s, 737s, DC-9/80s, B-52s, KC-135s, KC-10s, etc.).  I have never seen a UFO before. The single craft was almond shaped with the widest part at the rear.  The edge around the object appeared to be white.  The space inside the perimeter of the object was almost transparent.  I could see the blue sky through it.  The white edge around the craft looked like a slow spinning gear.  It moved north in a straight line.  The craft was flying at a high altitude.  It had no wings and it did not emit smoke.  There was no contrail.  No lights.  No sound.  At high altitude, it was longer than, and much wider than, a high flying B-52.  At least two times as wide.  It was not moving across the sky as fast as a large jet aircraft.  Because it was transparent, I can't estimate how tall it was.  I have never seen anything like this object.  It was not a large helicopter.  It was not a hot air balloon.  It did not look capable of flight. I tried to show my son the object, but I lost sight of it twice when I momentarily looked away.  I saw it two more times and then lost sight of it as it moved farther away. Please feel free to contact me via e-mail.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
