A long bodied object hovered in the air over Elk Grove, too high in the sky to be a chopper. The object moved.  ((Star??));2013-04-22 21:00:00;2+ hours;A long bodied object hovered in the air over Elk Grove, too high in the sky to be a chopper.  The object hovered up and down and side to side. The object had what appeared to be white lights along the body approx 3 in a row from my vantage point, but as it moved, various different colored lights flickered around it.  It stayed in on spot for over and hour and has gradually moved down the horizon but is still there now (22:34)  My 2 housemates also viewed the occurence along with me.  We attempted to take video but did not have a camera with that range of zoom available. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
