I was outside talking on the phone when I noticed from the corner of my eye what I initially thought was a really bright star or a planet.  It caught my attention because it was much lower than all of the other stas and was also ALOT brighter.  It had kind of an orange glow to it.  It was pretty low right over the houses too.   As soon as I noticed it this thing lit up BRIGHT.  It looked similar to when you see the fireworks on 4th of July when they set those one off that just make a huge flash followed by that really loud deep boom only there was no boom.  It just flashed big and bright then too off at warp speed.  It litteraly went up and to the South East direction and out of sight in less than a second.  It did leave a strange kind of trail when it left that left a streak across the sky that lasted a second or too but dissapeared quickly.  I noticed also that after the flash there was what looked almost like gold sparks falling from the spot the object left from.   Within minutes of the occurance several military type jets and a helicopter were circling the area where the object was.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
