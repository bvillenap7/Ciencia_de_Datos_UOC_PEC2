Fast moving large rectangle craft flying North to South over Sacramento, CA, in the night sky;2019-07-26 23:59:00;8 seconds;Fast moving large rectangle craft flying North to South over Sacramento, CA, in the night sky On the evening of Friday, July 26th, 2019, I was out in my side yard just South of Sacramento California.  It was close to midnight and dark, with normal light pollution for my area.  I was facing North when I saw above me in my peripheral vision something moving fast in my direction.  I looked up and saw a very large rectangle moving very fast approximately North to South over Sacramento and it continued its course until I could no longer see it in the distance (was still heading South). It crossed almost directly over my head at what seemed to be above a normal airplane altitude but spanned the distance of the entire sky in approximately 8 seconds from the time I first saw it.  I don’t know how fast that is but it made the F-22 Raptor I’ve seen near Fresno seem sluggish, cumbersome, and awkward flying in comparison.  It traveled effortlessly, was a light color, possibly silver or a light grey—I could see it in the dark but it had no lights on at all—and it also made no sound.  The rectangle was approximately the shape of a stick of gum.  I’d guess about a 3 to 1 ratio with no other form to it and it went forward in width rather than length wise. I wish I knew more but I only had enough time to think I would Google it to find out what it was.  In doing so I found no explanations for what it could be besides a UFO.  I was elated after seeing this, it was a pretty wonderful sight.    The only thing I can think is Beale Air Force Base up North but again I found no satisfying information on the internet.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
