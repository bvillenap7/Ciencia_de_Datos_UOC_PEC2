tracked 10 starlike objects across sky 8 were traveling south to north, 1 traveled west to east and one traveled north to south;1999-09-07 20:07:00;1hr10min;((NUFORC:  Description seemsto us consistent with satellites in either polar, or easterly, orbit.)) acked 10 starlike objects across sky 8 were traveling south to north, 1 traveled west to east and one traveled north to south objects were the brightness of the average star as seen that night. it was a steady light and did not shimmer like starlight. there were no visible navigation or strobe lights (as used on private and commercial aircraft). the objects appeared in the following cronology and time intervals (times are at point of first sight, all took several minutes to travel across horizon to horizon). 2007-S to N2027-S to N2037- W to E2039-S to N2051-N to S2053-S to N2107-S to N2110-S to N2112-S to N2116-S to N. These observations were prompted by sightings of a similar nature I witnessed on the evening of 9-5-99. On that night I saw 5 similar objects travel south to north within a span of about 20 minutes between 2100 and 2120. On 9-6-99, I observed at the same time as on 9-5-99 and only saw 1 south to north object and 2 shooting stars. On 9-7-99, I thought that if they were all satellites, they may be transiting slightly earlier each night. That is why on the 7th, I started to scan at 2000. The objects appear as satellites both in light consistency and straightline paths. I am curious that if they are indeed satellites, why are so many in the same orbital direction and so closely spaced? On 9-8-99, our sky was cloud obscured and I was unable to make any observatios. On 9-9-99, I observed from 2000 to 2130 and only saw 2 south to north objects and 1 west to east object. If these are satellites, where did the other 7 objects on the 7th go?;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
Red / Orange light in a fixed position;2002-09-07 15:40:00;1 hour;Red / Orange light in a fixed position Sitting in front of my computer, I just happen to stare out of my bedroom window to see this small reddish/orange speck of light in the clear blue sky in a fixed position.  I stared at this light for about 5-6 minutes in the same fixed position and then I lost sight of it.  I could not find it for at least 2-3 minutes and then all of a sudden I see the same light in a slightly different position of the sky and a lot further away (much higher altitude).  The light was still reddish/orange but very small.  This time it seemed to move in a zig-zag pattern but not going in any particular direction.  I lost sight of it after about 15 minutes.  I went back to my computer wondering if it was a satellite or a bright planet/star - certainly was not an airplane. After maybe another 10 or 15 minutes later I look up and there is the light again in the first original position I had seen it - Only this time it was a white speck of light (looked like a star)!  Again, it stayed in the same spot for a while and then disappeared and again showed up and was at a much higher altitude.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
I saw a moving star like light in space flash a bright lite at me then turned on spotlight at it and it came back and did it again.;2003-09-17 03:00:00;1 minute;I saw a moving star like light in space flash a bright lite at me then turned on spotlight at it and it came back and did it again. On this night I was up late and was outside I live in the country away from town looking up at the stars and was drawn to the northeastern sky, after about 5 min. I saw movement in the distant sky like a star moving, I thought satelite but it moved east, west, north & south then seemed to come right at me for a split second with a bright flash of light not a ray but a bright flash also still in space. I thought no way could I have seen that but I knew I had. At this point I was a few steps from my truck where I keep a powerful spotlite living in the country it's a good tool to have as there are lot's of animals about at night I retreived my spotlite and aimed it at the exact location of what I saw for the hell of it and turned it on/off/on/off/on/off then opened my truck door and put the light away and as I stood there at the truck and shut the door I looked up and dam if it did not return and do the same thing exactly what I saw the first time and then it was gone into space.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449

There were planes in the sky at this same time. Head-on, you may see a very bright light, but they always show flashing, colored lights at some point in their flight. I was intentionally sitting out back by the pool watching the sky, with the hope of seeing a UFO on the 4th of July.... again. I saw a similar one (not quite the same... 4 lights under one vehicle) 2 years ago, but did not look long for one last 4th of July.  This sighting consisted of a bright light coming out of the south, directly at me, in the far distance.   After a few seconds I could see that it wasn't one light, but two. When I could see the clear separation between the lights, I watched as the vehicle slowly turned 90 degrees to the east (as the two lights merged into one with the turn), proceeded a short distance east, stopped for a few seconds (as to watch some fireworks below?), slowly backed up and turned onto the original flight path (as one light again became two), then continued almost directly over me at a fairly low altitude (lower than any passing commercial jet and somewhere close to single engine private plane low to medium altitude).  It was silent and flying faster than any plane, jet or prop, but not super fast. It continued to the northwest and disappeared toward the big dipper at a constant rate of speed.  I estimate the total time I saw it from horizon to horizon was about a minute.  No plane that we have would clear that distance in that time at that low altitude and not make a sound.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
6-7 peach-colored craft moving easterly direction.  Sacramento area.  Midnight 2016 New Years.;2016-01-01 00:00:00;1 minute;6 - 7 peach colored craft moving easterly direction. Sacramento area. Midnight 2016 New Years On December 31st/January 1st very close to midnight while traveling south on Ca. Hwy 99, from Sacramento to L.A.. Just south of Sacramento, about Elk Grove area. I noticed 6 to 7 light peach colored, illuminated objects in the sky. Moving in a Easterly direction. Having been in the Air Force and seeing many air shows at first I thought they were a formation of military helicopters, they were moving about that speed. Slow and steady.  They did not appear to be that high up (less than a mile. Maybe a half to 3/4).  Being night time it was difficult to tell.  Also, being in a big rig and on a hwy it was not possible to tell by sound (too noisy).  For that same reason I could not tell if it made any noise. The formation was very odd as well.  One I've never seen before. 4 points to make a square, then one above to form what would look like the pitch of a house. Then another 3 times the length out from there.  Pointing in the direction it was going.  East, north easterly. I've been a night driver for many many years.  I've never seen anything like this before. My gut feeling was this was not E.T.. I did not stop for a better look. So I could not tell if this was one object with lights or several objects (by seeing if there was a star field between them).  They moved in perfect unison. I watched them for about a min before they and I passed beyond my windshield view. The color of the lights were very odd.  Like no color I've ever seen on a flying craft. Not red nor orange. More like a faint peach color. Or a spot light turned down very low (color wise) yet the light was very illuminated.  Having flown and taken lessons planes have two colors.  One on each wing.  Red and blue or blue green.  White lights forward.  Never peach. I thought about a blimp for New Years, that's possible, but I sure could not make out its message?  For what it's worth.  Much further south out around hwy 41 and 46 on both hwy 99 and Interstate 5 we have many night time crop dusters that you can get all kinds of crazy light formations (not different colors) because they fly in very weird positions to prepare for crop dusting in a very short span.  My point.  UFO sightings in those areas are more likely crop dusters than anything else.  This or these were definitely not a crop duster.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
