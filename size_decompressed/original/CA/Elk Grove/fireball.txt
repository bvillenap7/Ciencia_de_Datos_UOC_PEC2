There was absolutely no noise.  I thought it was a reflection from my TV onto the window at first. I then realized that it was in the sky. This orb seemed to be levitating.  It proceeded from south or south-east to north-east.   I ran back inside after watching it a moment to grab binoculars.  On closer look, though it had traveled a considerable distance in just a short time, I was able to see green flashing lights.;38.4168396121885;-121.409714958449
