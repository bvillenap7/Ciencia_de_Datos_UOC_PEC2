Shiny metallic flying object carrying a second green triangle shaped object;2017-08-19 18:50:00;11-12 minutes;Shiny metallic flying object carrying a second green triangle shaped object At 6:50 pm, my wife and I were in our backyard discussing Mexican food, when I looked up and saw at approximately 900-1000 feet high an odd looking object that was definitely not a plane or a helicopter and appeared to be carrying a triangle shaped second object.   The main object (don't know what else to call it) was very shiny and appeared to be metallic.  The top of the object resembled the shape of the letter S if it were faced backwards and seemed to have several strange cable like “arms” that were attached to and carrying the second object.   My wife also saw the object and also was in awe and not sure what top make of it.   We watched it travel in an awkward zig-zag pattern heading North-East as it gained altitude for about 2 minutes, until it was at a out of site.   Shortly after, an airplane flew overhead in the direction of the strange flying object.  I took a  few pictures with my phone and a short video, which I will attach. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded, and sincere,  We suspect he is an excellent, and highly reliable, witness.
