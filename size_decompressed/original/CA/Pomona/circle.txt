5-6 red circles, stationary.;2002-09-08 20:25:00;All night;5-6 red circles, stationary. I saw 5-6 red dots in the sky.  They were very bright and bigger than most visible stars.  A lot bigger.  They weren't moving, just stationary in that one spot.    To the North.  I first thought they were from the mountins, but they were far too bright and I had never seen them before.  They stayed there all of the night and when I woke up the next morning they were gone.  I saw them against a clear night. ((NUFORC Note:  Had they been stars, they should have moved across the sky with the other celestial bodies around them.  We do not know what the witness observed.

Strange object high in the sky!;2008-01-14 14:15:00;20 minutes;Strange object high in the sky! This is the second time that I have seen them the first time, was like this time, but many didn’t believe me because of all the dates it just had to be on April fools day!!! But, I still go with the story, because coming up with a lie is not my thing. Well, this is how it happened, I went to the back of the house because I wanted to play with my little puppies, when I just looked in the sky and started wondering about that day when I saw the UFO. Well, I don’t know how I knew they were there because I saw what looked like a dot!! At first I was like it’s got to be a plane but it stayed still, then it stared moving south, very slow, it seemed very high up! And the acqward thing was that airplanes were passing right at the bottom of it! That’s when I started thinking that it’s got to be a balloon or a bag! And at that moment I called my sisters and my brother because this time I wanted witnesses! They came out side and asked me what’s wrong I said you wont believe it remember what I saw on April Fools it there again! They started searching for it and I told them were it is! Then my sister Virginia saw it and she said, “What is that” I told her you see it? She said yes. Well a couple of minutes later my other sister saw it and my little brother! I was so happy that I had witnesses but that’s when another one appeared. I told them oh my god there’s another one!!! When I saw the other one I got so scared! Because I started thinking maybe we see them. Well the strangest thing was that the were moving at a very slow speed, at first one would be ahead then the other. But then they’d go back and it was just so strange. A couple of minutes past when one of them just took off and headed south and disappeared, but the other on were still there! Just moving slowly.Oh yes and another thing that really creped me out was that one of the object was showing a red light at times and the other one flickered a blue light! That was the weirdest part, it actually creped out my little brother, because how could! it show the light in the middle of the day!!! Well, the saddest part is I didn’t have binoculars to get a better look, especially a camera! But the next time I will be ready, because I really want to know exactly what they look like because it was so high up that I couldn’t take a good look at it! It just looked like a dot, but you could still see it so it means it was probably large. I just hope I can see them again because they leave me with so much amazement and wonders!

From front yard of my house, it was perfectly clear skies when I looked straight up and saw a white dot that I almost looked away and d;2014-10-02 15:14:00;14 minutes;From front yard of my house, it was perfectly clear skies when I looked straight up and saw a white dot that I almost looked away and dismissed it as mid day star.  But then I noticed it was moving in a Northwest direction.  A few months ago I watched the space station move across the sky at night over southern california.  It resembled that to me as in the size and speed at which it moved.  But then I noticed once it got from directly overhead to a slight northwestern direction it seemed to stop and then move in a flat eastern direction slowly for about 2 minutes.  If I had to judge distance the movement from the beginning would have been 3 feet in line of sight from southeast to northwest then about 9 inches in line of sight eastern direction before continuing northwest out of my site behind a obstructing tree.  I saw several plans flying at high altitude flying near or directly underneath this object and it was obviously way higher than them. Like I said it looked like a mid day star but moving. When it was directly over my head at the beginning of my sighting it seemed to shimmer as if it was reflective.  Which in turn would kind of make it look larger and smaller.  The last I saw of it, it was getting fainter but as if something that moves away gets smaller.  I have always been into ufo sightings but never had what I felt to be a genuine sighting.  I would not report something that I did not feel that needed to be genuinely looked into. I am excited to find out if it was something explainable or not.  I wish someone else could verify my story.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679
Circular object with multiple red, blue and green flashing lights, making very tight turns at a fast rate of speed.;2017-06-23 20:35:00;5 minutes;Circular object with multiple red, blue and green flashing lights making very tight turns at a fast rate of speed. I was sitting at a park near Pomona California at approximately 8:35pm with a friend and my dog watching a music video on my phone, when my friend frantically kept telling me to look at this object flying to the west of us.  He asked me if it was a drone.  When I did look I saw a circular object with multiple red, blue and green flashing lights moving NW just above the flight path of jets taking off from Ontario Airport in the San Bernardino County. I told my friend it can’t be a drone because it’s too close to the airport and that’s when the object stopped and went back heading SE for about 5 seconds, and then started making very tight circles at a fast rate of speed. As the object was doing these maneuvers in the sky there were jets taking off from the Ontario airport and knowing that when the jets do take off they hold at 5,000 ft until cleared to make their turn away from the airport.  This object was above the jets at about an altitude of 15,000 ft.  There is also a flightpath going west to LAX and those jets fly at 30,000 ft.  These jets were definitely very high above this object. The object continued moving NW to East and South in tight maneuvers including going up and down about 5,000ft.  Judging by the flashing lights of the object compared to the jets that were taking off and other jets that were very high up the object had flashing lights that did not resemble the lights on the jets plus the lights were very bright. We watched this object for about a good 5 minutes, until it started going SW at a very steep angle up, and it was out of sight in about 6 seconds.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679
