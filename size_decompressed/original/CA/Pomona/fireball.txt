We had just emptied the back of his truck with furniture and he had gotten inside his truck to leave, so I was talking to him thru his passenger window, So I was facing north.  It was a very clear night so I was looking up towards the north and I seen a very strange light orange light coming south in a slow and low altitude, about the same altitude a helicopter would fly, but this was not a helicopter, nor was it a plane.   We couldn't see past the orange glowing light to see what shape or form it was, also there was no sound.  At the same time a plane was coming from Ontario airport from the south, so I told my friend now that is a plane, because we seen & heard it was a plane and it flew right over us and as it passed over us it was heading towards the strange orange light and we were quite for about two seconds and both of us said there going to hit and we seen the planes wings turn to the right and mo! ve out of it's way.  The orange light just stood on it same track going south and as it passed over us it had no sound and no wings or atleast we couldn't see any type of physical form.  It continued on it's path South and almost collided with another plane which was on the path from Ontario to L AX Airport and they missed and a minute later it was gone but the orange light had no sound and it looked as if it was doing minor zig-zagging, but it definitely was not a helicopter nor a airplane.
