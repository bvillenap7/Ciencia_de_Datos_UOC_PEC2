At first glance before the bright white flashing I thought it was the north star then I thought a plane or helicopter but I stood still and told my friends to look up that it was not moving just flashing bright white they said its a plane, they continued to walk towards the car I kept looking at it for about 1 minute then looked down to see the time when I looked back up it was gone I looked all around in the area just to see if i could see it, it was gone. I have had other sightings in the past of other different abjects and have told friends a few times when there with me I seen things but they see nothing and tell me im seeing things  I just dismissed them as some sort of plane which I know there not but this time I had witnesses.
