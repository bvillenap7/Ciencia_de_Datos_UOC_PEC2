fast moving white/yellow oval object over inland empire;2011-02-05 17:41:00;5 secs;fast moving white/yellow oval object over inland empire I was looking out my window facing south on 02/05/11 at 17:41:00 (I jotted time/date after the event) enjoying the sunset, when I saw a white/yellow oval  shaped object moving  from west to east at 3 times the rate of civil air carriers.  I knew immediately it was something I’ve never seen before.  I jumped up, mouth open, eyes wide,  fully understanding this was my 1st UFO sighting.   I live just south of the San Gabriel Mountains and just west of San Jacinto Peak.  From my location it appeared to be coming from Los Angeles area heading east bound  towards Palm Springs, Salton Sea area at appx. 4000 ft.   What I find interesting and validates my own sighting is the posted sighting in Indio which occurred the same day (02/05/11) with a reported time at 17:35:00. BTW Indio CA is 90 miles east, bearing 103 of my location. Coincidence?   I’m ex military/FAA air controller.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679
