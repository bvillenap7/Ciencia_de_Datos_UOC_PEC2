Orange light then pulsated brighter, then dimmed, eventually dimmed out completely. Duration of sighting lasted approx. 8 minutes. I was out for my nightly walk when I noticed in the southwest sky a bright glowing orange sphere about twice the size of Mars.  The light moved in a northeast direction as I ran back home to get my wife to witness this.  My wife came outside and we both observed (I through binoculars) as the orange sphere released several smaller spheres of light, dropping them downward.  At one point there were at least 3 of these lights dropping at the same time as another light shot up from above the object.  We continued to watch as the light pulsated brighter and then dimmed until it dimmed or winked out.  This is the identical object that we observed on 3/29 at approximately the same time of night.  However, this time the object was not near the airport as it was on the first sighting.  We were not watching a planet, as planets do not travel across the sky and then stop and drop spheres of light out of them.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679
Multiple orange/red spheres in sky over Los Angeles County;2012-07-08 21:30:00;1 hour;Multiple orange/red spheres in sky over Los Angeles County Driving Westbound on Foothill Blvd. at Town Center, noticed people pointing at the sky and using their cell phone cameras. Continuing east bound on Foothill Blvd, noticed multiple spheres in the sky towards the foothills at a high altitude.  Turned North bound on Town Avenue and pulled over. Several witnesses on Town avenue and at Chevron on Foothill cross street of Town. Lights appeared to be spherical. In groups of 2 and 3, these lights appeared to be moving slowly from West to East. Lights were orange/red and steady in color.  There did not appear to be a strobe effect or any aviation lights on these objects.  There was no audible sound associated with them. They would continue on and from my vantage point, appear to go straight up and disappear, or fade completely from sight. Periodically, one or two would begin to move south on Town avenue and appear to correct their &quotcourse&quot and re-join the other spheres. This continued on for the better part of! an hour. I personally counted at least 30 of these objects. A jet at one point did go over head at a  high altitude. Jet did not appear to be military.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679
3 orange spheres flew within a mile or so of my neighborhood and kept fading in and out of site and made a triangular formation.;2013-12-05 20:10:00;still 9:56;Three orange spheres flew within a mile or so of my neighborhood and kept fading in and out of site and made a triangular formation. After returning home from marching band  practice, me and two others in my truck noticed three floating  orange spheres above the 71 Express way.   After the truck had  passed under the strange spheres, a few seconds later, they started fading away.   When we reached out house, about a third of a mile away, the 3 spheres had moved about 5 to 10 miles in opposite directions creating a large triangle formation.   All  three aircraft faded in and out of view during the whole duration, leaving behind only one ufo  then immediately the other 2  would rejoin.   At one point, it appeared that the three craft were creating a perimeter around the Ontario  Airport.   Moreover, one of the orange spheres  rapidly accelerated, towards my direction (westward,  with me looking east), then dramatically stopping within a mile or two.   After  an hour or so they all faded away, as multiple passenger aircraft flew in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Three orange spheres in two events at & north of the San Gabriel Moutains.;2014-10-19 19:55:00;<5 minutes;Three orange spheres in two events at & north of the San Gabriel Moutains. 	On 19 Oct 2014 I witnessed two separate events.  These events were  viewed from my front yard in Pomona, Ca.  All objects I viewed were a orange, and sphere shaped.  First event I assumed was military activity, from Edwards AFB or even Vandenberg AFB.  The second event was not from either site. Event one:  	At 19:55 I witnessed a orange light appear from behind the San Gabriel  Mountains.  The mountain range is from west to east. I am about 10 miles from the peaks. From my yard, I witnessed a orange sphere appear from behind the range.  It was in view from 10° and rise to 45°+ above horizon.  It   began at 350° N and with straight up trajectory.  Within 15 seconds, passing through clouds it faded away.  Looked like a rocket launch, compared to ones I have seen in the past.  This one did not last long, and faded quicker than any other launch.  My thought was that it was a short range missile. Event two:  	At 20:04 I witnessed my second sighting. This one was nothing like the first.  This event started on my side of the mountain range, with two orange spheres. The objects were brighter than the first.  They running together,  parallel along the mountain range.  The lights were separated by at least 20° in altitude from my perspective.  The lower of the two spheres, I believe was lower than the mountain peaks.  Or less than 10° from the horizon.  They traveled for 15 seconds or so. When they hit the 350°N line, like the first.  They both went vertical, and faded away around 45° up. 	I can not tell what they were.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679

At 7:35pm i finish watering the garden and just stood around in the backyard looking at the plants and the sky.  It was past sunset but the sky was still clear blue and visible. At 7:46pm, I looked up east of the sky looking towards the neighboring city of Montclair or looking over the Inland Empire.  I saw a bright light sphere object.  It was between yellow and orange in color. Still focus on the object it started ascending very slowly.  Then it started shrinking, in what look like if it was in steps or in stages of large to small perfect spheres.  While it was shrink at the same time it look like it was losing some of its yellow orange glow, and would looked like a silver or grey color.  Then after staring at it for about 15 seconds, it just disappear.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679
