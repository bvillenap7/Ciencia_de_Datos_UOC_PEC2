Hovered for approx 5 minutes, then began to move in an upward northeasterly direction stopping periodically and dropping at least two balls of light.  Stopped again and hovered for approx 4-5 minutes witnessed by both myself and my wife through binoculars. Brightness intensified approximately three times and them dimmed and disappeared. Approximately 10:20 pm PST I began my nightly walk heading south.  Immediately, I observed an orangeish/red glowing object in the sky southeast of Foothill and Garey in Pomona, CA.  Kept watching the object for the next 10 minutes making my way back to my house.  As I walked north, it seemed to move north along with me.  It stopped, the light intensified and it dropped a sphere of light out of its bottom.  When I reached my house, I grabbed my binoculars and called for my wife to come out and see it.  I observed the object through the binoculars and saw red and white blinking lights on each side of the object. One more sphere of light dropped from the bottom as it hovered there. I then gave the binoculars to my wife who also observed the same.  We watched for approximately four minutes during which time the light intensified greatly several times before dimming and disappearing.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679

bright light moving across morning sky.;2010-04-07 05:20:00;2-3 minutes;bright light moving across morning sky. One round shape bright white light moving not fast but not slow very steady across sky. There were no other lights flashing or blinking like on this object. On normal human aircraft there are safety lights that blink. Not on this one. No noise or sound coming from the object. There was no tail like on a comet or exhaust trailing behind this object. This object just moved at a steady straight pace to where ever it was going. I like to gaze the skys, but I have never seen anything like this. It was brighter than the stars in the sky. This is why it caught my eyes.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679

I left my house around 2 AM to get my girlfriend something to eat. As I was leaving my house I noticed it was quite dark darker than us;2019-09-13 02:00:00;Minute;I left my house around 2 AM to get my girlfriend something to eat. As I was leaving my house I noticed it was quite dark darker than usual like my light from my house was not penetrating far enough outward when I know it does. as I walked out I noticed three beans walking behind my girlfriends car. these beans had large heads and look like they were wearing space suits of some kind. I stepped out word yelled at them it’s like they ignored me. I stepped out form underneath my porch and a bright light shined upon me I did not hear a helicopter I did not hear anything At all. All I saw was this bright light it reminded me of an LED light but there was something different about it there was a mist around the light it was like it was trying to locate me. To this day I still can’t explain it and I don’t really like talking about it. Another thing is it was very hot that summer week  we had the AC going on all day it was hot at night at 2 AM.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679
Approx 5:30am observed 20-30 bluish white lights traveling Southwest to Northeast . ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-29 05:30:00;15 minutes;Approx 5:30am observed 20-30 bluish white lights traveling Southwest to Northeast at extremely high rate of speed above the cloud cover At 5:30 a.m. my fiance and I were woken by our son crying. After consouling him and getting him back to sleep we stepped outside for a cigarette.  Looking to the night sky we proceeded to see 20-30 bluish white lights evenly spaced above the cloud cover traveling at an extremely high rate of speed Southwest to Northeast. I am relatively familiar with  normal earthly aircraft abilities observed from the ground due to our current residence being under a flight path.  These objects exhibited no common aircraft traits I am aware of , the lights, spacing, spacing, formation,flight path, speed. The closest aerial object I could relate them to would be a satellite although they were far brighter and moving at an inconcevable high rate of speed.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679
Caravan of lights moving NE that appear out of nowhere while others moved about as protection.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-01 21:00:00;6 minutes;Caravan of lights moving NE that appear out of nowhere while others moved about as protection. Like herding cattle. Lights appearing seperate one after the other in a line out of nowhere in sky moving northeast as other lights that were not moving off on either side of the line of the other lights began moving and had a different color to them orange not bright white or bluish like others.  They seem to be doing a military like staggered and protect formation. There were two that laid behind for a while as if to cover where the “caravan” had come from for about 5 more minutes.  They moved in the sky effortlessly changing directions which is impossibly for a drone or plane.  And I can say I see at this distance ... well they were moving really fast.  Faster than any plane or rocket anything on this earth.  My partner and I were astonished and tried to get video but my phone was a fail.  I’m certain now that we are not alone.  And I can’t find anybody who saw the same as we did.  It wasn’t space x it wasn’t satellites it was not from here unless there’s a cover up from the public.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679
