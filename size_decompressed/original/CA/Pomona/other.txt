Light flashing then disappears in the day time sky.;2010-09-16 18:48:00;3 sec.;Light flashing then disappears in the day time sky. I was driving south bound on the 57 freeway in california at 6:48pm pst. I was about to merge in the the line that allows you to get on to I-10 east. I was inbetween the pass right by Raging Waters. As the valley view of pamona opens up, I always look at the hill on the other side. I notice that the hill only has trees in the shade. I think that is kinda odd everytime i see it. So I look up and see this flashing light. I am not sure how high above the hill it was flashing. It was high enough in the sky to be a star. plus it wasn't the right time of day to be seen. It flashed about 10 times then I never saw it again. It happened so fast that I could get the passanger in the car to even see the light. I text my friend a message right then and there to get a time stamp.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679
