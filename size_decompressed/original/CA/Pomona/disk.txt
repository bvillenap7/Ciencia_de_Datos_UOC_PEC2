Golden colored UFO.;2014-10-05 19:40:00;2 seconds;Golden colored UFO. Well, I was walking at the park with my mom when my feet got really tired and i decided to take a break and sit on a bench.  As i was walking, i saw towards the front of the park this golden-yellow colored UFO that had that stereotypical dome on top (you know the one where the aliens are in and they can see everything?  the one where its made of a glass) and it flew very fast behind the trees in front and disappeared.  It was a bit bigger than your average car but a lot smaller than the giant UFO i saw before.;34.0660110169488;-117.766966440679
