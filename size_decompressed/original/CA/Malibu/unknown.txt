I heard a sound coming like a plane, but lighter rumbling.  I was on second floor, looked out and up my window.  I saw the underbelly of a flying craft that covered the complete view above me. I saw two distinct round red lights adjacent to each side underneath.  I followed flying object as it went over the pacific.  It seemed either round or oval shaped, not sure.  I saw big red and white lights blinking. The entire view was huge compared to the normal plane lights I usually see.  The under belly was metalic, minus the big red lights.  But it was hard to make out everything under there as it was such a surprise to me to be experiencing this.;34.0389158536585;-118.73792804878
