red and orange lights pulsing in random sequence/ seemed like communicating;1994-06-14 02:00:00;5 min.;red and orange lights pulsing in random sequence/ seemed like communicating we were working a graveyard shift. Our task was to drive test computer software for a new cell phone/cell sites. 6 months of drive testing and this one early morning at approx. 2 am I noticed the object appear (out of know where)over the ocean approx. a mile from where we were driving. As passenger I insisted we stop but the driver sped up and I convinced him to finally stop as well as the other team in another vehicle. We all stood there on the highway watching the craft start to display what seemed a communicative code. Never a sound, just a display. Then, after about what seemed 10 minutes and not long enough. the craft started to move horizontal in a NW line faster and faster without ever making a noise and just disappeared. Then it seemed the sun rose and that was strange.;34.0389158536585;-118.73792804878

I was watching a plane, to see if the plane was at an altitude above the clouds.  It was higher and as it passed over the clouds I saw a silver tube with a fuzzy white dot in front of it that appeared in the cloud to the right, then it traveled through clean/clear air (between clouds) and crossed under the plane and into the cloud on the left where it disappeared.  The plane continued on and I grabbed a camera for a photo reference.  Approximatley 60 seconds later. The ‘Tube’ was metallic blue/gray and almost blurry, the white fuzzy dot in front of it kept a distance that remained the same distance throughout the sighting.  I say fuzzy white dot because it did not strike me as a light. Very Odd and I can’t stop wondering what it was.;34.0389158536585;-118.73792804878
