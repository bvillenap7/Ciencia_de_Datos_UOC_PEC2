On the date specified above I was working in the Zumirez beach area of PCH in Malibu when I took a picture of an electrical power pole,in the direction of the ocean sky above. At the time of the taking of the picture( with a digital camera) I didnt see anything in the viewfinder, nor by looking in the sky.I was later in the office after downloading,that i saw a distinct image for the first time. It is diamond,( or square on a half turn) bright white or silverish in color,with a real pattern to it. Something like four bars with four dots on all four corners and illumination in the middle. Im not sure what it is.After asking co-workers who have dealt with electrical occurances for the past 20yrs, figured out that this was nothing electrical related as far as they were concened or have ever heard of.I actually have the image clear as day printed in color, as well on disk.

A half green-half red diamond shaped craft moving west fast and silently;2013-09-04 19:40:00;30 seconds;A half green-half red diamond shaped craft moving west fast and silently I was in Malibu, California, standing outside, on Sept 4 at around 7:40 PM local time.  I looked up to see an object flying overhead.  It appeared to be at 1,000 – 2,000 AGL (I’m at sea level).  It was diamond-shaped, but with soft edges – ie, it looked not-quite round, not-quite a diamond.  Assuming I’m right about the altitude, it was the size of a corporate jet.   Wat really caught my attention was its colors: its right half was red, its left half green - yes, the opposite of navigation running lights.  These colors weren’t on the tips – each entire half of the craft was of each color.  They lights didn’t flash or pulse.  It could have been painted on.  It was silent.  It was moving basically west in a straight line  (tracking the east-west run of the coastline).  It was moving at probably 200 kts, given how fast it traversed my view.  I saw it starting right overhead, and continuing till trees blocked my view, so it lasted maybe 20 - 30 seconds. It was not a balloon-it moved in a perfectly straight line westbound, while there is always a southern sea breeze.  It emitted no visible exhaust.  It did not glow or flash.  A woman with me saw the same thing.;34.0389158536585;-118.73792804878
