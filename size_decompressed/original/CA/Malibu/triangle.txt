I witnessed triangle craft being chased by military planes near NAS Pt.Mugu Dec.2004;2004-12-28 14:00:00;1 minute;I witnessed triangle craft being chased by military planes near NAS Pt.Mugu Dec.2004 Was driving on PCH west of Malibu. Ca. south of the Point Mugu Naval Air Station. There is an strech of rode where campers can park by the ocean just south of Mugu Rock. It was a nice day so I had the window down. Suddenly to my left just off the beach bout 100 yards a dark triangle shape craft flew by quickly! Looking Past the craft I could see two military fighters about a mile out keepig pace with craft. It was nothing I had seen in 20 years in the military! Ahead of me the coast took a jag to the west toward Mugu Rock this craft followed the coast line and as it did it turned it side exposing it top side. I could see no tail fin and no cock pit. This craft made no sound and I was very close! It scared the heck out of me because I thought it would crash but it did not. It came to Mugu Rock and very easily negotiated around it keeping the same distance away.Scared and curious at the same time I accerlated and got past the rock as fast as I could. Once past the road was straight for a distance of a mile and so and I could see the air station clearly. no planes were seen in the air. I hurried down the road to where the road turned east and I could see down the road and too the city of Camarillo. no planes in sight.I kept searching the skies but saw no planes.It was a very unusal event. The only reason I am reporting it now is because some one else reported a similar incident in the same area 2 years prior(June 2002). I know what I witnessed.
