My friend and I were on the beach near Coral Canyon in MAlibu CA and we say a sort of Light/ fire ball falling out of the sky. It was going at an incredible speed and it was less than a mile away. It looked like it hit the ocean but it was night so I can't really confirm if it did or not. Once the object made its way to the ocean's surface, it disapeared, so my guess is that it went underwater.The date I gave above was approximate. I could have been a couple years before or after.;34.0389158536585;-118.73792804878
Two orangish lights in the night sky moving and then disapeared.;2013-03-03 19:30:00;5 minutes;Two orangish lights in the night sky moving and then disapeared We were looking at the stars after walking back from dinner on the beach and our friend noticed two lights in the sky that were a steady more orange color than the stars and were not flashing like airplanes.   One was moving slowly while the other one seemed to stay still.   We watched for a couple minutes to see if they were airplanes because there is a fair amount of airplane traffic above Malibu heading towards LAX.   They were definitely a different color light and not flashing like airplane lights do.   While we were watching the one that was moving just disappeared, then a minute later the other one seemed to get dimmer and then just disappeared.;34.0389158536585;-118.73792804878
