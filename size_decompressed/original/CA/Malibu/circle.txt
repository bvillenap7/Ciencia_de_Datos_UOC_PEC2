Orbs rise up out of Latigo bay in Malibu California.;2014-04-15 23:00:00;5 minutes;Orbs rise up out of Latigo bay in Malibu California. While driving home on the Pacific Coast Highway, I stopped in turn lane by Latigo Canyon Road, while waiting for the traffic to allow me to turn I looked out over the ocean.  At first I thought it was a boat on fire and quickly crossed PCH and pulled over to call 9-11.  When I got out of car with my cell phone I then only realized it wasn’t a boat but these large round orbs coming up from the water. I was so nervous as the first two came towards me and went right over the mountains heading north east.  The other seven orbs made a straight line right up the coast. I was so nervous my hands were shaking.  These orbs seemed to change in size and color after coming up out of the water.  I was hoping to zoom in but my phone doesn’t allow that.  I’m sorry the video is so shaky.  I have seen many sightings living over the beach in Malibu...this was the first time I was able to record it. I am standing on Latigo road recording this which is about a half-mile from the beach, these orbs were very bright and large.   I am hoping you can have experts look at what I have and give an explanation to what I had seen.   Thank you.;34.0389158536585;-118.73792804878
Bright white pulsing light over Las Flores Canyon Malibu;2021-02-14 20:30:00;1 hour;Bright white pulsing light over Las Flores Canyon Malibu Last night between 830 and 930 pm, a blindingly bright clear white pulsing light was blasting through my bedroom window from a sharp (at least 45 degree) angle above the trees, in the exact direction (as the crow flies) from LA County Fire Department Camp 8.  The direction was looking approximately 200 degrees south west.  In all the 24 years I've lived here I've NEVER seen a light in that window from that direction. It hovered ABOVE the trees.  My boyfriend and I stared at it for 30 mins, wondering: is that the Fire Camp's helicopter? why isn't it moving? if it's emergency vehicle lights, why are they bright white with no red or amber?  The area is covered in at least 30 foot high oak trees and this light was above them. It appeared as large as if it were a helicopter less than a mile away, but blinding lights, not a single beam of a helicopter you'd see searching for something underneath.  I fell asleep and by 10 pm it was gone.  The light was pulsing and so clear bright, it blasted across the canyon to the other side (approximately 1.5 miles across).  I called the Fire Camp 8 this morning and said: I'm making a crazy lady call, were you doing helicopter training last night? I told the captain what I saw and he said no, the helicopter was not being used last night.  He also told me that the fire captain in San Diego had a similar experience recently and everyone thought he was nuts, but there was no other source of light from a vehicle, plane, helicopter.  I don't believe in conspiracy theory. I don't necessarily believe in Martians (but I suppose there must be life out there somewhere).  What we saw made no sense. It was beyond odd.;34.0389158536585;-118.73792804878
