Fire colored cylinder changing shape to circle;2010-07-16 22:42:00;2-3 minutes;Fire colored cylinder changing shape to circle 16 jul 10      Approx. 10:45 PM*        34.03N  118.78W   I was at my desk, working on the computer.  The computer is in front of the window.  The window was open.  I noticed a very bright object in the sky. I thought it was a plane on fire, heading towards the ocean. First point of observation  The window faces Southeast and is 3’x3’. The object moved from E to SE, horizontal with a slight ascending direction, just over the tree top, (tree is about 40’ high and about 100’ from window. The shape was cylinder like, (side view of a plane, without the tail, no wings).  Using the size of the window, 3’x3’ as a reference and a piece of tape on the window to represent the object, the tape would be about 1 to 1 1/2  long, and 1/4 wide. The color was  an orange-yellow-red liquid fire and was moving/flowing/changing within the cylinder.  It was very bright,  and had depth, as if you could see into it.  (It did not appear to be a flat surface, but a surface with depth)  There was no glow or halo around it and no trailing tail.  All the light was contained within the cylinder.  No sound. Second point of observation  As the object neared the outer edge of the window, I went outside to continue observation.  (Retraced steps today and it takes approx. 45 secs. to get to where I was standing last night.)  The object was not where I thought it would be, instead, it was stationary and enlarged into a circle. (I thought the plane had exploded.  There was no sound and nothing falling from the circle.)  The light was contained within the circle, there was no halo and it was not as bright as the cylinder light.  There was still movement within the light.  The circle dimmed, brightened, dimmed again and then blinked out. I returned to the house and checked the time:  10:45 PM. Standing in the same place today, I noticed the size of the circle and location of the circle was almost in the same place as the (whole)  Moon was at 5:24 PM today .

Dull object changing shape and flashing while moving in and out of vision;2017-04-14 21:50:00;14 minutes;Dull object changing shape and flashing while moving in and out of vision It was a warm night in Malibu, California I was approximately half a mile from the ocean shore and the sky was particularly clear for a Los Angeles night.  Around 9:30, a friend and I went outside to hammock.  Around 9:50, my friend pointed out a strange white, but not bright object in the sky.  I looked up to see a large, floating object closer than a plane would fly.  As we observed the moving object, a plane flew high above it (it was descending into LAX), meaning the unidentified object was much closer to Earth than we first realized. I would describe the sighting as not a bright white object, but a dull almost brown shape that was changing size in a repetitive pattern.  It would twirl and become quite large, but get smaller as it rotated - only to be large again within seconds.  I would estimate the size of it to be fifty times the size of a star from the naked human eye on Earth.  Also, there seemed to be a red, glowing light from the core of the flying object.   I went inside to grab some binoculars, and within three minutes the object had moved to the south east towards Los Angeles and had become much smaller, as if it was flying further away.   We continued to watch it, along with a couple of other friends, as it gradually became smaller.  All the while, it continued to move in the same pattern.   Within several minutes, at around 10:04 pm, the object disappeared from the atmosphere.   We witnessed only one object in this whole ordeal.;34.0389158536585;-118.73792804878
