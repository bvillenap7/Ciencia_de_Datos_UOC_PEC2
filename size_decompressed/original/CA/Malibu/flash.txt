a blue light moving over the Santa Monica Bay, changed directions and flashed off.;2008-11-28 22:20:00;3 Seconds;a blue light moving over the Santa Monica Bay, changed directions and flashed off. As I was driving down my street, looking over the Santa Monica Bay, I noticed what looked to be a shooting star streaming across the sky. As I continue to watch I noticed that it couldn't be a star it was too bright. I watched as this blueish hue of light turned red for a quick moment, then back to blue, changed directions on a dime and took off with a flash. It was moving east from the ocean towards the mountains/city and then it turned 90 degrees and moved out of the sky on a southbound trajectory. Amazing sight. My first one.
