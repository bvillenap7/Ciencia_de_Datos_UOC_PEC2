You see that?  Yep.  ((deleted)).  silence returned, as we realized deep in the core of our consciousness, that life was deeper than the ocean we surf.  we didn't talk any more, transcended by the experience, peaceful that the answer was a resounding 'yes.'  the next set of waves passed by while we both kept staring out at the fog bank, boards pointed towards the open ocean, the sky into which the ! 'craft' had disappeared.;34.0389158536585;-118.73792804878
UFO captured in picture 5/14/2006 - Daylight;2006-05-14 14:00:00;?;UFO captured in picture 5/14/2006 - Daylight I am contacting you to see if perhaps there was anyone else reporting seeing a craft in Malibu, Ca, on Mother's Day?   I did not witness it physically.   I took quite a number of pictures that day, and after reviewing them was amazed to see a shape I have seen a 'million times'.   I have never captured this before myself, though I have researched and studied all I can on the subject.   I have the image that was captured with a Olympus SP-350, 8 Megapixel, prosumer camera.   I would love to forward it, in the very best resolution possible.  I can upload it to an FTP Site.  Please advise.   Nothing is out of the ordinary in the picture except this shape.  It was quite high over the area.  It IS NOT a bird, or a plane, or a helicopter. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a copy of the photograph.  PD));34.0389158536585;-118.73792804878
