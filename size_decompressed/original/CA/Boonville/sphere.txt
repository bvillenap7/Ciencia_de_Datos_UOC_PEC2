I do not recall the exact property, but looking at a map, and recalling a brook that passed through the farm, I would say that I was on the south side of Rte 253 right where the brook crosses 253.  After a day of helping around the farm, just after dark, I was sitting leisurely on the grass against an embankment  facing the highway.  The hill I was leaning against sets back about 3-400 yds from the road. I was chatting with a young lady that joined me there as a guest. I was 19 and she was about 24.  As we spoke I noticed what appeared to be the wing lights of a small plane, above the hills which are beyond the highway. The lights looked to be about a mile or so away at that time. The lights came directly over the road and over the farm toward us. They took quite a while (perhaps 5 minutes)to reach the farm area and by that time I had surprisingly noticed that there was nothing but space between the two lights.  A plane that travels at 60 mph would have taken only a minute to get to us.  They were glowing a subdued dark orange, were about 12-15 feet in diameter with maybe 40 feet separating them. They were not discs, but were spherical.  They made an almost inaudible crackling noise like static electricity and appeared that way too. The two balls went directly over our heads perfectly parallel and side-by-side bearly skimming over the hill I had been leaning against, which is to my memory, about 2-300 ft up. They passed over us without slowing down, but they were moving at only about 10 mph.  Immediately trailing the two spheres were like a static-y charge, like a kind of faint sparkle. Stunned for a few moments as I realize what we had seen, I ran inside the mobile home there, which was the camp kitchen and screamed about what I'd just seen.  The couple of folks that were there were busy and thought I saw something way up in the sky.  So I ran back outside and there were still 2 trails where the two UFOs had p! assed ov er.  I never pursued any action, nor did I call police or any authorities.  What I saw was real, and very close. Twenty years after the fact I want to know what I saw!
