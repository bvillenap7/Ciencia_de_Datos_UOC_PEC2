We saw 7 UFO just after sunset that were blinking colored lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sightng of Sirius, we suspect.  PD));2006-10-28 19:30:00;one hour;We saw 7 UFO just after sunset that were blinking colored lights. On 10/7/06 we noticed a UFO sentinel in the northeastern sky.  This object was very far away up in the sky and stayed positioned in one spot all evening and until it could not be seen any longer after daybreak.  It changed or emitted colors bluish/green and orangish/red in flashes.  We could not make out the shape as the object was very far away and we were looking through binoculars.  The binoculars brought the colors into focus, otherwise it looked like a bright object.  What caught our attention was the brightness of the object and the fact that the object did not move from the same position and when we looked at it through binoculars we noted the color patterns.  Fast forward three weeks until 10/28.  We noticed the same sentinel object in the northeastern sky as night fell.  This time my husband saw it go into position.  Also two other craft lined up in a triangle position and alternatively had a blinking pattern with the colors described above.  One or the other of the three objects would be brighter and exhibiting the colors.  At about the same time 19:30 in the northwestern sky we noticed 4 other bright objects in the sky with three of them making a triangular formation and the 4th object set back from one of the other three objects.  These four objects alternatively blinked brighter with the described colors.  We had dinner about 20:00 and at 20:30 went back outside to discover all but one object remained in the northeastern sky, the sentinel craft, in that one particular location in the northeastern sky that we noticed three weeks prior.
