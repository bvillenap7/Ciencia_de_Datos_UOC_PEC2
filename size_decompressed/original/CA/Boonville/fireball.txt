white ball of flame in Mendocino county.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  Re-entering Chinese rocket booster.  PD));2016-07-27 21:30:00;20 seconds;white ball of flame in Mendocino county I'm a country boy.  Often I sit out at night and enjoy the warm summer nights.  Tonight I saw what looked like a white ball soaring through the sky trailed by flames.  As soon as this happened I drove to the nearest town market (about 30 minutes away) to get something to drink only to have the other three people in the store including the clerk talking about what had just happened and if anyone wanted to investigate because it looked like it crash landed on a local road 50 or 60 miles out.;39.0178;-123.3897
