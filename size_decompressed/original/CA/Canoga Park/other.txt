Three lights in Thousand;2009-11-24 23:02:00;30-40 secs;Three lights in Thousand On November 24th 2009 approximately 2302, I stepped out to the patio of my condo to smoke a cigarette.  I was facing westward looking over the hills of the Thousand Oaks area and I saw what seemed to be three lights dancing up and down in unison.  There were two colors red and blue.  The single red light in between the two blue lights. Now, granted our condo is under the flight paths of the Van Nuys and Burbank airports, so we do know what airplane and helicopter lights look like at night.  Three things made us come to this website to report it. 1.) There was no flashing light that it would indicate it was your typical helicopter or aitplane. 2.) The rate of speed that it was doing it's maneuvers (up & down).  I was in the military, and there is no way a helicopter can do these maneuvers at that rate of speed. 3.) This is the third time we have seen this!  I just wanted to get the word out and see if any one has seen this as well.

It left behind a large cloud roughly several miles wide that kept spreading while the light moved northward.
