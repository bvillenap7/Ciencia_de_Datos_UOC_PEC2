possible UFO fly by;2008-03-02 22:00:00;7 sec;possible UFO fly by I was standing out on my balcony having a smoke, when I saw an object clear my entire view of the sky in about 5-7 seconds.  It made no sound at all, that was what really got my attention.  I know what air planes sound like at that height, I have seen my fair share of comets and meteors, and have also witnessed MIR (space station) on an occasion when it passed by a few years ago.   This was like nothing i've ever seen and I am utterly baffeled. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));34.2012277896527;-118.597815476696
bright star/light moved for a couple seconds turned red and disappeared.;2011-03-08 19:30:00;1 or less minute;bright star/light moved for a couple seconds turned red and disappeared. I was on the phone with a good friend of mine while watching the sky/stars around 7:30 pm MAR. 8..... i was looking at the stars like every other night. one star looked a little brighter then the rest.  i dont know how long it was there for but when i looked at it it started moving slowly for about 5 seconds and stopped for 2 seconds.  At this point im trying to see any kind of mechanical movements. but all i see is a bright star that stopped. after 2 seconds of stopping the whole entire star/light turned red and dissapeared like it was never there. i hope someone else saw this as well or else im seeing things.
