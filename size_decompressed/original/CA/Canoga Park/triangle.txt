V-Shaped UFO appears over canoga park california.;2003-06-23 21:00:00;Nightime;V-Shaped UFO appears over canoga park california. It was around 9:45pm I was walking home in Canoga Park, California when a V-Shaped UFO flew over my head, I looked up just in time to see it cleary. It had 7 Lights under the UFO in V-Shaped formation and it flew 7-8 stories up from the highest building in the city which was 10stories. I am still unsure about how many people saw the craft since I was the only one walking in the streets at such late of a night. The craft moved slowly at least 10-20 miles per hour or less for about 3mins then just dissapeared without a trace. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.2012277896527;-118.597815476696
