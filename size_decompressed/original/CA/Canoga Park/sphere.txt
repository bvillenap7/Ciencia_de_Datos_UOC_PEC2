UFO Sighting At The Turn of the Century In the SFV , CA;2000-09-30 18:24:00;3-5 minutes;UFO Sighting At The Turn of the Century In the SFV , CA My neighbor and I were talking one night.  It was the end of summer, beginning of fall, I remember, around the year 2000.  I was tempted to report the incident but was too baffled as to who to tell and who would believe me, as it occurred so fast, but the incident has always stuck in my mind.  I found this web site and realized other people did report the incident.  Anyway, my neighbor and I noticed 4 saucers in the sky to the west above the SFV, over Canoga Park, near the Pacific Ocean.  The clouds were streak like that evening and the red sunset was beautiful in the sky.  At around 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. (unfortunately not sure of the exact time) but right as the sun was setting that year, we noticed 4 aircraft with colored lights around each of them.  The aircraft were flying in uniform formation, all somewhat close to one another.  I think the lights were blue, orange, red and yellow (not sure how many colors I saw).  Anyway, the 4 aircraft hovered down ! for a short period of time (not sure how far down to earth or how large they were as they were miles above earth)and then as if by mental telepathy they knew we spotted them as we were commenting on them to one another.  Then, the 4 aircraft stopped, changed course and with a fast trajectory zipped into some sort of hyperspeed out of eyesight and were no where to be found.  We have never seen airplanes accomplish such speeds, trajectory or disappear so quickly.;34.2012277896527;-118.597815476696
RED SPHERE travels in West San Fernando Valley sky New Year's Eve 2008/2009;2009-01-01 00:05:00;5 minutes;RED SPHERE travels in West San Fernando Valley sky New Year's Eve 2008/2009 I was at a  2008 to 2009 New Year's Eve party, in the backyard of a house near Shoup and Saticoy Street in Canoga Park, California, when my friend and I saw a UFO in a clear night sky above us.  Just after the count down to the New Year, my friend and I noticed a bright red sphere moving unusually across the black sky.  The red sphere moved sideways, up and down, and back and forth unlike a plane or satellite.  When it came to a stop above us in the sky, we thought for sure it was a UFO. My friend took photos of it on my camera, but he didn't zoom in or take actual moving video, which discouraged me later.  The red sphere made no noise or sound whatsoever.  It looked like it was parked to view the fireworks going off in the West San Fernando Valley.  It looked like it had large round windows around the orb itself. The first photo shows the red sphere moving, and the other photos show it still in the sky.  After a few minutes, it either disappeared or its lights simply went out.  I am not surprised it disappeared, because a bunch of people were standing around with us in the backyard pointing at it yelling, Look! A UFO!.;34.2012277896527;-118.597815476696
Above the San Fernando Valley.;2017-05-02 13:15:00;5 minutes;Above the SF Valley Black object way up in the sky.  Way higher than helicopters normally fly and moving way to slow to be an airplane.  Had red and white light slowly blinking on and off.  Object moving northward then just vanished.  No trace.  Now there's what looks like a HUGE craft hidden in the clouds directly above the valley.  Moving very slow.  Southwest bound.;34.2012277896527;-118.597815476696
