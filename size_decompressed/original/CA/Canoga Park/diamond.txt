At 11:50 am a military jet was flying towards north at a very high rate of speed, but above the plane a much faster craft was flying, the craft was actually trailing the craft and after about 1 minute the craft made a turn and dissapeared very fast for a moment I was under the impression that the craft was trying to either intimidate or crash against the airforce plane.;34.2012277896527;-118.597815476696
