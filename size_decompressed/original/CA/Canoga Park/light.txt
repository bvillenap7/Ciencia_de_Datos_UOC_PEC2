I WAS FINISHING UP MY LUNCH BREAK OUTSIDE WHERE I WORK IN CANOGA PARK AROUND 4:30AM AND NOTICED A FUZZY ORANGISH/YELLOWISH BLINKING LIGHT ZIPPING LEFT TO RIGHT, RIGHT TO LEFT AND THEN CIRCULAR MOTIONS OVER DESOTO AND PLUMMER CROSS STREET AREA. THIS WAS JUST A MILE OR TWO NORTH OF ME. THERE WAS NO SOUND.USUALLY IF A HELICOPTER IS THAT CLOSE WE CAN HEAR IT BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND. THE BLINKING FUZZY BALL OF LIGHT WAS NOT BLINKING IN A CONSISTANT ON/OFF PATTERN AS IT ZIPPED AROUND BUT IT WAS INDEED BLINKING. THEN I SAW IT GO EAST. THE SUN HAD NOT RISEN YET.;34.2012277896527;-118.597815476696
Very bright white light, even glowing object, the size was about two 747 airplaines nose to tail.;2013-01-06 06:05:00;<60 seconds;Very bright white light, even glowing object, the size was about two 747 airplaines nose to tail Driving north on Topanga Canyon Road, just over the tree tops in a residential area, their was a very bright light I would even say it was glowing.  I just saw a side profile, so I could not make out the shape.   Then the trees block my view, so as I went around less the 100 feet, the object was gone.  If it would have crashed, it  would have been in a residential area.  It was no a helicopter, because the object was long, probably, the size of two 747 airplanes, but made no noise.  Also, if it was a light point up from the ground, you would have seen a trail from the light.   Whatever it was, it was something I've never seen before.

This UAP looked just like the planet Venus white and blue light except th three times as bright and was moving.;2021-06-01 21:56:00;Two Minutes;This UAP looked just like the planet Venus white and blue light except th three times as bright and was moving. The object was moving in a NorthWest to SouthEast direction above from approximately the intersections of Parthenia and Canoga to Roscoe and De Soto. The object can be described as a very bright looking star. I looked and listened very closely for wings, rotars, and jet engine sounds. This UAP did not have any signs whatsoever of having any conventional design. This was NOT a star or a drone. This was not the front light of a jet airliner. This was not a satellite or the Internatiinal Space Station.;34.2012277896527;-118.597815476696
