Cigar shaped object glowing orange over topanga canyon blvd.;2007-08-18 21:55:00;10 minutes;Cigar shaped object glowing orange over topanga canyon blvd. I was taking out the trash last night and noticed a cigar shaped object hovering in the air to the north past topanga canyon blvd. The object appeared to be an orangish white color. I quickly went inside and told my wife to check it out. She looked out the window and observed the object now moving towards the north. We both went outside and watched the object kinda bob along then move away to the northwest at a pretty fast clip.it then appeared as if we were observing the object from the rear as it now appeared as a star but still moving. 30 seconds later we observed it again as a cigar shape. it was getting farther away and a helicopter approached it then flew away. the object then disappeared high in the sky.;34.2012277896527;-118.597815476696
