Bright light with red around center moved towards us;2004-06-05 04:15:00;20 Minutes;Bright light with red around center moved towards us At 0315 hours one of the kids was in need of water, returned child to bed and stayed up for an hour. Upon returning to bed at 0415 June 5, 2004 and looking out large window on second story with unobstructed view to the south from our hillside home, I noticed a strange bright star? I continued into master bedroom and then backed up and walked over to side window for second look. The object was gleaming in the sky with star shape form with red tint around center with an estimated distance of 3,500 south and 500' from ground. I rubbed my eyes and continued to watch for ten (10) minutes prior to waking my wife. We then both continued to observe the star like object for several minutes with object maintaining horizontal and vertical position. After approximately 8 minutes the object started to move towards us, north, and to the west the and rapidly moved up behind homes to the west of our home approximately 500' due west. The object was now heading due north behind homes.  As object moved, we ran down stairs and out the front door. The object moved out from behind and directly above neighbors home and shape appeared to be diamond shape with cylinders at each corner extending up 20' high with white light, bright white light! It appeared to be solid light. The object was estimated to be 150' to 185' long. I purposely listened for any type of engine sound similar to aircraft, none detected. As the object gracefully moved past or from behind house accross street, it headed west with out tilting like typical aircraft and settled below ridge west of neighbors home with out noise and with in 150 to 300' of horizontal distance/travel.  My wife contacted police department. She also contacted Mather Airport and Sacramneto Airport, both denied having any aircraft with in 2 miles of location.  I have been a Project Manager in the Heavy Construction field for about 20 years, and my wife was a Flight Attendant for a major airline for about 13 years, and now a stay at home mom with 3 children.;38.6840999999999;-121.0676
Amazing craft bright blue & red 2 nights in a row.;2011-10-17 19:45:00;15 min;Amazing craft bright blue & red 2 nights in a row. 2 Days in a row we have seen and have multiple photos of items in the sky the main craft is a very bright red on one side and very bright blue on the other with a white stripe down the middle.  After reviewing the photos there are multiple other odd shaped and colored items or crafts in the photos that we have no idea what they could be.  The main craft will spin and make very fast moves throughout the sky and then it dissapears and will re-appear elswhere in the sky.  We have never seen anything like this and hope to video it if it happens again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I took several shots, and noticed a faint line on the sky, like a vapor path of a high speed plane, so I decided to zoom in. I took a picture and made a GIF  file (rapid succession of 20 images).  Upon reviewing the photographs,  I noticed something strange--several objects appearing and dissapearing alomg the vapor path that is also strange as it is single and not double as those left by military jets. My friend was with me at the time of making these photos, using my Galaxy Note 8 phone.;38.6840999999999;-121.0676
