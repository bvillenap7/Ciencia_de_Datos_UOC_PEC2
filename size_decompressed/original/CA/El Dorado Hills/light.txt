No blinking just solid light. traveling in perfect formation. either one large object or 3 small ones. No blinking just solid light. traveling in perfect formation. either one large object or 3 small ones. traveling faster than jet or plane yet slower than a shooting star. No sparks or trails seen. traveled the sky from left to right headed towards direction of rising moon. when got to where moon would have been (was not up at the time) they? changed direction heading away from field of view as if it was moving towards the moon. light faded out at this time. I had time to stop truck put brake on and get out and watch. I had one other witness in vehicle.;38.6840999999999;-121.0676
Star-like bright light with fire colored, pointed tail. Moved, then became stationary.;1999-11-13 22:00:00;5 min.;Star-like bright light with fire colored, pointed tail. Moved, then became stationary. This location is just east of Sacramento, CA. Just about 2 or so miles south of Highway 50, on Latrobe Rd. It is in the foothills, and very rural. The stars show brightly. I would be happy to draw a picture for you if you are interested. Looking south, the moon was very round and bright. I looked up and saw a bright star-like object with a fire colored tail moving to the right of the moon. I called two other people out of the building and by the time they got there the fire had gone out. The light continued to move to the right and downward. It stopped at about '3 or 4 inches' from the moon and stayed there for at least 2 hours. I work graveyard, and I had just arrived at work, so I know the time is correct. I came out on my first break at 12:00am, and the light was still there. I know next to nothing about stars etc. but it seems there is usually one in that position. However, we did see this light move rapidly down to that position. I've been noticing little things up there over the past few months, but I attributed them to my eyes playing tricks. This, however, was no trick of the eye. I thought it was just one of the meteors that I'd read about and heard Art talking about, but it stopped dead still, so I just thought I'd mention it!;38.6840999999999;-121.0676
At 9:25pm on 11/01/2009 a bright light hovered over a mountain range due west of eldorado hills, ca and it abruptly disappeared.;2009-11-01 21:25:00;30 seconds;At 9:25pm on 11/01/2009 a bright light hovered over a mountain range due west of eldorado hills, ca and it abruptly disappeared. At 9:25pm I was walking to bed when I passed by our sliding glass door and noticed an unusually (what seemed to be) star due west of home.  The 'star' looked to be hovering still over the next mountain range.  At first I thought that is way too bright for a star, so I considered it might be a plane.  I looked closely for appx 30 seconds and the light did not move at all and their were no other lights associated with it to indicate it was a plane.  At that point the light disappeared completely.  If it were a plane, not only would I have saw at least some movement, but I would have saw the tail lights or other lights when it would have turned.  Their is no other way to discribe what I seen, other than a UFO.;38.6840999999999;-121.0676
Object moved at a rapid speed in several directions disappereared/reappeared.;2012-05-06 20:55:00;5 minutes;Object moved at a rapid speed in several directions disappereared/reappeared. A bright light appeared approx 5 miles away in the southern sky.  The object hovered, and then moved rapidly to the right then back to the left.  Faster than any helicopter could maneuver.  After about 1 minute the bright light completely disappeared.  After about 30 seconds it returned and continued to maneuver back and forth and up and down then rapidly moved to the south until it was no longer visible on our horizon.  We have a photo of the object which shows a 90 degree light with a separate vertical light.;38.6840999999999;-121.0676
2 Objects in the Eastern Sierras and a white beam flashing;2013-07-27 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;2 Objects in the Eastern Sierras and a white beam flashing We saw 2 distinct lights/objects moving together slowly towards the South in the Eastern sky paralle to the Sierra mountains.  As the two objects moved one flashed a bright light for just a few seconds towards our direction (West).  After a minute or two the two objects separated and one changed direction and headed at a 90o heading West as the other object continued South.;38.6840999999999;-121.0676
Bright blinking light very far away that moved right to left and vertically with 2 smaller object's leaving it.;2014-01-15 05:30:00;30 minutes;Bright blinking light very far away that moved right to left and vertically with 2 smaller object's leaving it I saw a bright blinking light far away in the distance to the north and slightly west of my location. It moved sharply and quickly in both right to left and up and down directions. I also saw 2 smaller lights come out of it. It was in the sky for at least 30 minutes.  I also saw this object approximately a week ago at about the same time in about the same location.  I thought it moved a little then.  But, this time I am sure it moved.  It was not a star.;38.6840999999999;-121.0676
multiple unconnected drone scale lights appeared at short distance and then within 10 yards of me then moved away;2019-07-27 22:30:00;5 seconds;multiple unconnected drone scale lights appeared at short distance and then within 10 yards of me then moved away While walking on dark moonless night I noticed flashes of light up near some oak trees may be 50 yards away and thought it was a drone at first but another source of light pulled my attention to about 10 yards in front of me near some cattails in the is little marshy area-  Again I thought drone but the lights were not connected and flashed, faded and then sped away back up towards where I saw the first flashes.  I thought well maybe it was kids with lasers pointers but the angles and lights didn’t move like that.  My music had stopped playing and I was  a little freaked felt like the lights had run off and away from me, so I wasn’t in a panic but alert for sure.
