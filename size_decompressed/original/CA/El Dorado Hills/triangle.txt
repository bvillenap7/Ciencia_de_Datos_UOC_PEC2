Large Black Floating Buidling (Box);2008-10-30 18:00:00;5 minutes;Large Black Floating Buidling (Box) I was driving and it still was some daylight left, there appeared a huge black I can only describe what looked like a floating building.  There was no noise.   I pulled to the side of the road on El Dorado Hills Blvd.  and it was slowly coming down and I thought it was going to crash into the Raley's shopping center so I pulled out from where I had stopped on the side of the road to observe what this was.  It looked like a box with one corner as the front of the vehicle.   I turned to go up a road, quickly as I thought it was going to crash and I hurried home to look out my window as I live up on a hill and I saw nothing.  As I was driving I could see nothing in my rear view mirror.   When I came home I looked up on line and in the news to see what might be there and I could never find anything.   I reported it on a site and gave my name and e-mail and never heard back.  I can't really remember the year, it was either 2008, 2009, October.
