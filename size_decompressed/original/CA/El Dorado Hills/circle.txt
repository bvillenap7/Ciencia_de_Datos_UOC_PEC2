At around 4:30 am on 9/20/00 I saw a strange blurry circular light. As it came closer to the house the light grew very large and pretty bright. There was no sound at all. This object came right up to the windows, and seemed too low to be an aircraft (especially with no sound). As it passed by the house I saw a completely round object, like a baseball. It was white in color, and it had a singular strand or line of red lights all the way around the center. The red lights were not on, but 2 or 3 would blink on randomly . After it passed the house, I then heard a very loud noise. Like a rip in the air? Its hard to explain, like a hole being torn in the air. I ran to the front window , and there was nothing. It was gone in a split second? I cannot explain what this thing was, but I am very sure of exactly the description of it. This was something I have never seen. The following day, military helicopters circled the general for several hours.;38.6840999999999;-121.0676
