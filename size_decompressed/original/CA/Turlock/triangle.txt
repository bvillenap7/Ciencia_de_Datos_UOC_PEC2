On Sunday morning I went out into the front yard to look for our cat.  Low in the horizon, to the south, I saw a bright white triangular object. Another of the same object appeared just east of the first. Then there was a quick streak of the same bright white color just east of the two objects.  As if the two objects sped away to the east.It was a very short streak that just stopped with no trace. This all happened in about 2 seconds. The objects did not hover or hesitate. <<<<<<<<<<<   <  < Arrows depict scene. I am a 41 year old female, married, two children,University graduate,self employed.;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723

Giant Black Triangle;2014-03-04 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;Giant Black Triangle Daughter in-law went to get something out of her car.  Location near Monte Vista and Colorado in Turlock, CA.  She heard a very strange rumbling noise coming from the sky and it made the ground vibrate right up through her shoes.   She looked up and it was suppose to be partly cloudy night. No stars and no clouds.  Pitch black.  Then she notice tiny pin points of red lights and was scanning to one side and then saw a soft round ball of white light.  It was then that she saw an edge around this soft ball of white light.  She scanned for the edge till her head was turned the opposite direction and saw another soft round white light.  The continuing her effort to fallow the edge she found a third corner and realize this huge black triangle was over her blocking the sky and moving slowly over her.  Again it made a weird rumbling noise which vibrated up through the ground into her feet.  It was picking up speed as it traveled South east over all the other homes around her.  She froze afraid to move until it got passed her. Next she bolted inside and got her parents who came out and it was too late it was gone, but they called the police to report it and were told that they knew already because calls were coming in. Next day I called Turlock Police to see if there would be any info given on the news about the craft.  The man I talked to did not know anything about the incident, but checked his computer and said yes there were reports and police went to investigate and found nothing.  I asked how many reports and was told only two and I asked why and if that would keep it from being newsworthy and he said that more phone calls could have come in but they only log reports and those that are not repeat descriptions.  So he said that there may have easily been more then 2 calls. I asked her if the object was bigger then a foot ball field and she replied oh yes. I asked bigger then three football fields and she said not sure but could be.  I asked her how high up she thought it was and she said it was massive and too hard to say how high up in the sky it was.  But it was so big that she had to pan her head all the way left and then all the way right to fallow one edge.;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723
Large triangular object spotted over Turlock, California.;2014-03-04 22:04:00;90 seconds;Large triangular object spotted over Turlock, California On March 4, 2014, at approximately 10:04 p.m., I had gone outside to get something out of my car in the driveway when I heard a strange loud rumbling noise.  I then noticed that I could actually feel the rumbling in the ground that I was standing on.   I looked skyward and was confused at first because the sky looked so black - no stars at all.   I then realized that what I was looking at was a large unknown craft moving slowly in a southeast direction.  It continued on in that direction until I could no longer see it behind the trees in the distance.   I called our local police services to ask if anyone else had noticed anything strange and they reported that they were receiving multiple calls to report the same strange object.   The object was triangular in shape with small faintly lit lights evenly spaced around each edge with brighter lights at each corner of the triangle.;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723
