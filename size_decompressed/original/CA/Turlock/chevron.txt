The sky was clear, the temperature was 65 F, no wind.  Stars were visible to about magnitude 4, some sky-glow. Observed a “V” shaped UFO traveling from a point in the sky slightly above Dubhe, in the  Big Dipper, to the South-East.  The object had circular, whitish – yellow lights on each segment of the “V” shape, with one being in the front center.  As I tried, and was unsuccessful, to count the lights, I noticed that they were not symmetrical along each section of the “V” – my best guess is there were 7 lights along each “V” in addition to the 1 light in front, making 15 lights total. The UFO traveled in a straight line and was observed from approximately 35 degrees above the horizon (compass shows the direction the object originated to be 300 degrees, and 150 degrees heading at 40 degrees above the horizon where it was last observed. With an outstretched hand, the object appeared to be about 1 inch wide.  The object made no sound.  The object had no standard navigation lights or strobes. The object was observed for approximately 10 seconds. Air traffic visible at the time showed no apparent notice of the UFO, this air traffic was on Vectors to San Francisco International.;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723
