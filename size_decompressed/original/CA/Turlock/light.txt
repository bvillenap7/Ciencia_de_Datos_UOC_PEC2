I saw a line of bright lights like star, it lasted about 3 seconds and disappeared.;1997-05-05 19:45:00;3 seconds;Summary : I saw a line of bright lights like star, it lasted about 3 seconds and disappeared. About 7:45 p.m. on May 5, 1997,I looked up in the sky and noticed a straight line of approx. 4 or 5 bright lights.  It caught my eye because of the straight line and how bright it was.  I was watching it and trying to figure out what it was, when it slowly started fading away, and then it was completely gone.  I looked around in the sky and noticed there were no other stars out.  At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it disappeared so fast.;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723
lights in two formations: a group of 3 then an hour later a group of 5 lights;2005-08-14 01:00:00;3 seconds each time gap o;lights in two formations: a group of 3 then an hour later a group of 5 lights My fiancee (31), her friend (34) and I (41)were all sitting outside talking on a clear moonless night. Just hanging out and looking at the stars.  When we spotted 3 lights flying in a line formation moving North right above us. At first I thought they were birds until we noticed that they were emitting light and not reflecting it. No running lights, no sound, moving at an incredible speed. They were pin-points of light, no way of knowing their altitude but I'm sure it was over 150,000 feet. I would approximate their speed at near 24,000 mph.  They described perfect distance between each other, flying in a straight path then once they passed right above us seemed to converge into just one light. I realize now that they did not converge but that the craft were leaving the area and moving straight out toward the northern pole-star area. As if they moved away in perspective. It was an awesome sight indeed.  Birds usually don't converge on each other like that, satellites are not visible by reflected light at that hour either.  Were were in awe by what we saw. And kept looking for other phenomenon.  After about 45 minutes we spotted another group of 5 (possibly 6) lights, also in line formation. these were moving North by North-West. Same characteristics and speed as the previous 3 lights. Only these 5 simply moved about 40 degrees and vanished.  I have seen strange things before but these two events took my breath away and left my heart pounding for hours!;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723

Four lights moving in the Ca Valley Sky;2011-07-18 21:30:00;3 min.;Four lights moving in the Ca Valley Sky Just before 9:30pm my wife and I took our puppy out to the back yard for his night time bathroom break. We live in the country so sky watching is just something we like to do.   While waiting I noticed a silvery light moving fast across the east horizon line.  The speed of it caught my attention.  I pointed it out to my wife  and then we notice 3 more as we began to look around.  They were almost directly above us.  The 3 were moving towards each other when we noticed them.  One was moving some what straight from a Southernly direction to a Northern direction.  One that looked like it was coming from the northern direction was moving erratically (like jumping from spot to spot.  It was also more bright than the others) but mostly head Southernly towards the one coming from the South.   The third just kind of appeared out out no where and seemed to be coming from the West. All 3 looked like they were going to collide.   My wife got excited because she thought they were g! oing to crash!  But it looked more like they passed right through each other. After crossing paths or whatever they did, the one headed more Northernly seem to pick up speed very fast and quickly disappeared into the North direction.  The brighter one from the North was still headed southernly but slowed and stopped for about 1 min.   The one that came in from the West instantly turned 90 degrees Northernly (but was more N/W in direction) at the point of meeting for the three.  It kept the same speed the entire time. It wasn't fast, but it wasn't slow!  We watched it till it faded off into the sky.   The brighter one that stopped, just disappeared where it was.  It looked bigger too compared to the other ones and most of the stars that are in the sky.   The other two seemed to be about the same size and brightness.  I would size them comparable with the majority of the small stars in the sky.  Big enough to see, but too small to see any detail.  Not like you would see if it were an airpl! ane, you can see its flashing lights.  Can only say they looked like w hite lights just like most stars look like, other than they were moving.;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723
Fast moving point of light.;2012-12-13 18:30:00;30 seconds;fast moving point of light I have to smoke outside, so I often look at the stars during the evenings when I'm out there at night. I have seen many satellites, fast low orbit ones and slow ones, this point of light had all the earmarks of a fast low orbit satellite as I watched it and it took a sudden turn without stopping or slowing to my surprise. I made note of the stars in the area and got a copy off my star program and plotted the path in the attached drawing. nothing else happened and there were no sounds.;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723
Orbs of light across the sky;2013-08-05 22:30:00;~1 minute;Orbs of light across the sky My daughter and I had finished movie night with my husband and we had gone outside to water my flowers in the garden.  During our conversation we were going back and forth and my daughter happened to look directly up into the night sky and said ,” look Mom there is one of those weird lights I’ve seen before”  I looked up attempting to see what she had seen and didn’t see it she again ,” it’s right there!”   At this point she grabbed my head and tilted it to where she was looking, and that is when I saw it. I was a ball of light very very high in the sky moving extremely fast.  I started to say that is was just a plane although is had no red or blue lights and was moving faster than any plane /jet I had seen, when the object looked like it expanded as the light ball grew and then contracted back to its original size.   While we were discussing that affect and what it could be we watched as it just disappeared in the night sky.  As we were still looking up amazed at what we had saw we saw a second object do the exact same  thing however it came from what would have been the object right side flared and then contracted continued steadily and then just disappeared.  I don’t know what we saw but I know I have never seen THAT before, hence our report.  Thanks in advance for your time and attention in this matter.;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723
09/26/13, 21:58hours, what first appeared to be a magnitude 2 meteorite made a climbing U turn - and then disappeared.;2013-09-26 21:58:00;3-4 seconds;09/26/13, 21:58hours, what first appeared to be a magnitude 2 meteorite made a climbing U turn - and then disappeared in a The time was 21:58, sky clear, temp 64 deg F. I made a UFO report online to NUFORC after seeing a chevron ,“V”, shaped UFO (at 20:23), and had just finished sending a drawing when I went out to my back yard.   I always look at the stars, and had been outside for about 30 seconds when I noticed what appeared to be a meteorite travel from the South – East to the North – East.  The object followed a shallow arc towards the Earth.  I was surprised to see that when it approached the area slightly under Cassiopeia it made somewhat of a “U” turn and went up and to the East and disappeared with a slight flash. The object had the same brightness you would see from a meteorite – and the flash was brighter than the moon. The object was white.;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723
Lights moving and dimming quickly.;2015-03-09 21:30:00;1 minute;lights moving and dimming quickly Tonight about 9:30 pm  3/9/15 , I stepped out on back patio to smoke and, as usual, I look around the stars. Over in the south west direction, I see a moderate flash of light that went out, followed by pause, then a dim light moving a short distance and going out, then a pause, then another dim light moving in opposite direction and going out, then pause,  then another light heading away then going out.....  all of this taking place within 1 minute and the area no larger then your fist held out ( obviously many miles away, est. 40 miles from my location ).   I have been seeing this same activity periodically for the last 2 years in the same area and decided to relay this to you because recently I read another persons account of exactly the same type of phenomena which he couldn't explain.  Up until I read his account I simply wrote it all off as distant airlines or satellites criss crossing each others path in a short time, or even meteorites. I decided tonight to check Google Earth and draw a path from my location to the direction of seen light activity and noted there was an Observatory about 12 miles north west ( also several small airports SW) of the light phenomena ( Diablo Mountain Range ).  I have no clue what this light activity is and I hesitate to call it ufo's ( as in alien craft ), but if you have people you know (or ufo researchers ) in that area of Morgan Hill California (or even San Joaquin Valley), perhaps they can keep an eye on the area of the sky just south of the Observatory for several months and verify this....      I'm sending an image from Google Earth to show location of activity ..... thank you;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723

Light flashed in 3 durations moving short distance over head then dramatically accelerated and continue to flash as it traveled.;2016-03-16 21:40:00;30 seconds;light flashed in 3 durations moving short distance over head then dramatically accelerated and continue to flash as it traveled. March 16, 2016.   At around 9:40 pm, I had stepped out to smoke on the back patio as is typical, in my peripheral vision I saw a flash of white light at around 20 degrees from overhead in a north – west direction.  I continue to watch that area knowing from past experience some satellites flash from the sun, and again it flashed as expected a little ways away from the original flash, then flashed a third time and dramatically had moved much farther away to my surprise… this thing had accelerated much faster then any fast satellite I had ever seen and in fact continue to flash periodical like skipping light on water sort of speak. It moved so fast I had to open the gate and  run around to the front of the house to continue watching, as I refocused my eyes this skipping white flashing light was passing an airline on its left side about 40-50 miles away. The direction of travel was just south of true west  (~250-260 azimuth ).  There was no fire trail behind as it flashed.  I have seen skipping meteors before with fire trails.   I must say, it’s the seeming acceleration that is puzzling;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723

Bright light over Turlock, CA.;2017-02-14 06:20:00;15-20 seconds;Bright light over Turlock, CA. My son and I saw a light as bright as the moon.  It was large, I observed it to be 1/5 to 1/4 of the moon's diameter. It seemed to be moving South to North.  We saw it for 15-20 seconds, and then it seemed to just blink out.  I looked like there were smoke trails coming from where it went dark.  It was still very dark, so the smoke trails may have just been after effects from seeing such a bright light.;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723

Satellite does rapid button hook maneuver.   ((anonymous report));2017-08-25 04:30:00;1 minute;satellite does rapid button hook maneuver I awoke at about 4:00 a.m. ( Aug – 25 ) and knew I couldn’t go back to sleep, so I got up and decided to read and perhaps grab a smoke out side, which is what I did.   At 4:30 a.m., I went outside and began to smoke, and as usual, I face north and star gaze and it was very clear, a little fire smoke haze but nothing bad.  An airliner was crossing the sky from W-NW  to  E-SE  and was north of my location, I enjoyed the stars as it headed to the Eastern horizon and I turned my head to look toward the western part of the sky for several seconds and turned my head back facing northerly again and saw a very bright satellite slightly north east of my location and headed the same path as the airliner, but the opposite direction.  It surprised me I hadn’t seen the hint of the satellite before I turned my head away, it was very bright and I watched it for ~ 10 seconds, and it began to fade in brightness, as is typical. I took my eye’s off of it to smoke and quickly decided it might flare up again, so I decided to attempt to quickly find it again, so I followed the path I had just seen, and saw a very dim satellite, slightly more north of the assumed path.  Here my brain is thinking how the satellite jumped off the straight line path if it was the same satellite, but very quickly, I notice this satellite is in a medium size turn, and not traveling straight.  I thought that this thing was going to head north now in view of this turn, (the turn can be best described as less then ¼ the circumference of a dinner plate at arm's length), and then the most fascinating thing happened, this very dim satellite brightened up and did what athletes call  “the button hook“ maneuver…  it accelerated rapidly in a very tight turn and shot back the direction in which it had come from.  I wondered if it was going to trail that airliner. This was no jet or satellite, this craft was moving at an astonishing speed at the end, and I will surely keep a closer watch on satellites from now on.  Are ufo’s now mimicking satellites so as to be less noticeable, it sure seems like it to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
