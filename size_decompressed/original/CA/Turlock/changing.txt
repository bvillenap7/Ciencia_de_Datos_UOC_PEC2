I was walking Friday nite & saw 3 bright stars  golden orange in a horizontal row. I was watchng it in the sky wondering what it was. I watched for almost the whole block while walking along the south side of Zeering Rd between Olive Ave and Fosberg Rd.  Then  2 cars drove up towards me on the street & headlights & trees overhanging sidewalk blocked my vision momentarily  The cars stopped & parked, one behind the other, small white cars.  A girl got out of eac car and said &quotDid you see that. Look it turned black!  Did u see it?&quot.  I thought they were talkin to me but they were talkin to each other. I said did u see that too? T he bright lite? One girl said &quotLook it turned black. Did you see that?&quot  They pointed to the sky and eventually I saw it I had misplaced it when the cars drove up with the bright lights.  It had turned black & changed shape into a flat floppy thing shifting side to side in the sky. It started falling straight down and lan! ded in a tree (I saw the branches move when it landed) in the park across on the north side of Christofferson Parkway.  There is a soundwall on the northside of Zeering in between the paralell south side of Christofferson Pkwy.  I ran to go see what it was but by the time I was crossing street it took off from the tree & flew southeast into a subdivision on the other side of Olive Ave. it was a large floppy black like an ocean stingray but more pronounced armiture. It was traveling about the speed of a car. I couldn't keep up. I'd tried to follow it but it was Flying diagonally across lanes & down the street. It was the most unusual thing I've ever seen!  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date to 2013.  PD));37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723
