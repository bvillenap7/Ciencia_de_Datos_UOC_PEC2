Fireball like object moving slowly down and east then pausing and bouncing then to decrease in mass and to then drop low out of sight.;2014-03-05 21:01:00;~1 minute;Fireball like object moving slowly down and east then pausing and bouncing then to decrease in mass and to then drop low out of sight. There was 1 large fireball/ starlike object high up in the sky.  My husband spotted from our bedroom window, it was moving very oddly slow down to the right, so it was unusual.  He then alerted me, where then we went outside to view object, where it then paused in the sky slightly bouncing in one spot.  Then continued to move down heading east.  Then right before our eyes it decreased in size to a smaller fireball like object, then paused.  Then dropped down low, to low for further visibility.  Very very peculiar like object.;37.4935574097138;-120.855553673723
