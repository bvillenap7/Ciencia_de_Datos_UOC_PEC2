We did not agree that the lights were following a pattern.  Light moved in straight lines and semi circular motions, stopping, and starting. The light were concentrated in a confined area. We were positioned at an altitude in the mountains at 5700 ft above sea level.  We were looking west into the stars 250 miles to thousands of mile into the distance.  At 45 degrees to the horizon the lights had to be many miles above the sea level.;33.728;-116.711

I stopped because I wasn’t sure what I was seeing. At first it looked like a meteor shower.  There were a number of “stars” that were twinkling and moving up in unison together.  I just stared and watched them all move and twinkle until they gradually disappeared in layers.  This happened over a minute or two.;33.728;-116.711
