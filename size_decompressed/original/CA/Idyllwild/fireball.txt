After a couple seconds it began accelerating toward the ground at a high rate of speed and i could see what appeares to be orange flames behind it, though at a great distance.  Seemed to be falling in the direction of hemet/san jacinto. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Orionid meteor??  PD));33.728;-116.711
