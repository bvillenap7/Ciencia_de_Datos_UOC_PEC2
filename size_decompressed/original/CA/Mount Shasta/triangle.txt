low flying, dark,  large car sized triangle with rectangle dim lights;2006-08-31 21:30:00;5 seconds;low flying, dark,  large car sized triangle with rectangle dim lights It was just about dark when I was on my back porch hanging out clothes. I was looking up as if viewing the 3 story apartment house's roof to the NW of me.  Right over my head flew a dark triangle just over my back porch and the roof of the 3 story apartment building.  It was a short view due to the size of the building NW (next lot)of me and not quite fully dark yet.  A more detailed map with drawing will be submitted as an update when I can.  It came into my view as it passed over my head look toward and above the 3 story apartment building NV of me. It was a dark, triangle craft, about the size of an old caddilac car.  There were dim, rectangle shaped lights from the point to the back, but not across the back.  Stranger yet was that there was one more light on the left size than the right side, like one light was out. It was about a 4/5 second sighting. I won't forget it.  I screamed for my roommate to come see, then passed him on my way back through the house to get outside to try and see past the bigger building. A street light, made further viewing impossible, past the larger building. It was moving along 15/20 mph basically paralelling I-5 from North Mt Shasta, towards, if it kept along that flight line, to the NW of Black Butte, to the town of Weed, Ca.  I would think that cars on I-5 may have been able to see it. I didn't think until later that I should have called Weed PD to look for it coming.  There was no noise, no engine seen, and it was too slow and quiet to be any sort of military or regular small plane I've ever seen.
