It hovered over the same area as if surveying it for 10 minutes and then zipped up and away westward bound until out of sight. Tonight, 10-20-13, we noticed it again, same place and same time.  It glows bright and dim between red and orange colors and seems to be spinning on an axis.  It stood and surveyed the same spot and did zip away westward until out of sight.  On both nights we saw and heard helicopters shortly thereafter seemed to be pursuing it from a distance.  Also on both nights, planes flew, took off, and landed without incident and undisturbed all around this object as if they didn't see it!
