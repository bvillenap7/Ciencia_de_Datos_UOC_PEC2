At approx 10pm last nighr, my son and I witnessed an orange globe floating from over McClellan AFB towards Antelope, CA.  It seemed to float slowly as if creeping or surveying the area below from a height of small planes like crop planes go at, which is like 500 to 1,000 feet.   Anyway there's an airport out on Elverta Road and a small plane from there was on direct route with this orange globe and the globe was about two times bigger than it, as the small plane was getting closer to it, the globe stopped and stood still, and all of a sudden it vanished before our eyes!  Like someone just turned off a flashlight!   I know that pilot saw it.  He/she was headed straight for it, since it was in their direct path! Then, poof! Gone!  We stared and scoped out the night sky, but it was GONE!   The small plane continued its course and went straight through the point where the globe had been just a minute ago.  Weird, but I guess pilots must be used to this by now!;38.7169;-121.3677

Multiple craft with constant blue light and an intermittent white light flew around one another and moved in every direction while on the northward course.  Craft were silent and moving at a high rate of speed (though the distance is not known).  The only rational explanition would be small, low flying and silent drones being flown as a squadron.  The shuttered McClellan AFB is located nearby.;38.7169;-121.3677
