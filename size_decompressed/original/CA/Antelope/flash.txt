Round flashing large object.   Hovered silently for about 15 minutes then slowly moved south, until it disappeared behind trees from our view.   The all white lights were very very bright...   I have never seen anything like this object on my 59 years ... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.7169;-121.3677
Moving and stationary blue white light, low in sky 9:20 pm.;2016-07-24 21:20:00;>1 second;Moving and stationary blue white light, low in sky 9:20 pm. I saw a flash, as bright as perhaps the size of 50 small stars combined.  It flashed in a white blue color.  Unmistakably huge. Not less than 15 minutes later, I see this same vivid blue white color zoom from my right to left low in the sky, and disappear within a very short amount of distance, again within less than 1 second.;38.7169;-121.3677
