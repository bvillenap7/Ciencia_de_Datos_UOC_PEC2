it was very dark as i watched them move acrss the sky.  ((Spacelink satellites??));2020-02-27 05:45:00;1 minute;it was very dark as i watched them move acrss the sky At 5:45am PST near Sacramento I went outside looked up at the sky and witnessed an on going stream of lights that looked like stars moving slowly across the sky north to south, they were evenly spaced, in a perfect line no pulsing light just a very steady light. I went inside grabbed my camera and recorded it for over 38 seconds but my phone shows nothing but darkness. It wasn't satellites nor was it any kind of plane. it actually looked like a line of stars moving slowly across the sky.  I saw at least 40 of them;38.7169;-121.3677
