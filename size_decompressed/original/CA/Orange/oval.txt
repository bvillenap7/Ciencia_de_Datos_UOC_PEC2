Possible sighting of Military Camouflage Technology;1995-06-15 18:00:00;30-45 seconds;Possible sighting of Military Camouflage Technology I'm a little hazy on the exact, it happened years ago. I have the information logged in a journal somewhere but where is anyone's guess. The reason I'm putting it on here now is because of something I saw on TV about new camouflage technology. I was traveling north on the 55 freeway. Early summer, warm, not a cloud in the sky. I first noticed a shadow move past me, moving North. I expected to look up and see an airliner as I'm not that far from John Wayne Airport.  Shading my eyes from the sun (which naturally would have caused the shadow) I saw nothing North of the sun. I looked back to the freeway and continued to see the shadow moving up the freeway. Again I looked at the clear sky and saw nothing so I looked back at the freeway. It was still there and still moving Nrth.  But this time I noticed the shadow was circular/oval and huge. The freeway moves pretty much due North. The shadow was moving in a North/NorthEast direction and I noticed that the edges of the shadow were overlapping both side of the freeway. That meant that it was wider than eight lanes and a center divider of the freeway.  Being in the printing industry, I know something about screen density and know enough about shadow to know the closer the ground is to the subject, the more dense the shadow. I would say the shadow was what would be called in the printing industry an 80% screen which means it was at a fairly low altitude. At that time, at the point on the freeway, the traffic was moving at approximately seventy and I would the shadow was doing a hundred and thirty to a hundred and fifty.  Also, I detected no noise but I was driving the freeway. Anyway, the shadow continued in a straight line until it disappeared over my horizon.
