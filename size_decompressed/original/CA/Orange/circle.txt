UFO disappears behind trees;1978-06-15 14:00:00;10 seconds;UFO disappears behind trees While traveling on the Riverside frwy the traffic was slow due to congestion. My sister and I both let out a surprised gasp and exclaimed a simultaineous Did you see that? It was a luminescent blue round object traveling at a tremendous speed as though it was being propelled by super-human power.  It was at a low altitude and soon disappeared below the tree level. There was no evidence of anything having crashed--no smoke or sound. It just disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to confirm a more precise date.  PD));33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
On a perfectly clear day I observed the shadow of an object 125-140 ft wide moving at 150 mph.;2000-07-15 17:15:00;15-20 sec.;On a perfectly clear day I observed the shadow of an object 125-140 ft wide moving at 150 mph. I am not reporting what I saw but rather what I didn’t see. Cloudless afternoon, north bound on the 55 fwy between the Katella and Lincoln turnoffs. The fwy in front of me is a very shallow bowl so you can see a lot of the fwy coming up. A large shadow passed (moving north) on my left side, I’d say approx. 150 mph. I instinctively looked up to see what it was. I saw nothing. I looked back at the fwy and watched the shadow move from the left side of the fwy to the right (the distance north, covering approx. 1 mile). Alternately watching the shadow and looking up to see what it was, I never saw anything. At one point, the shadow covered the entire fwy, both sides, plus what I’d estimate to be the width of two extra lanes on either side. The fwy, counting the emergency lanes and diamond lanes is 10 lanes. That would put the shadow somewhere between 125 and 140 feet wide. The reason I’m recording this now is I saw something on TV last week about a new camouflage being used with tanks, how they can transmit a picture of something on one side of an object to the other side, rendering it virtually invisible. When I saw the program, it seemed plausible this is what I’d observed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Orange light pulses then disappears.;2013-12-23 19:30:00;30 seconds;Orange light pulses then dissapears. Small single orange light sighted.  Silent and pulsating.  Color of an ember that floated in a straight line at constant velocity.  Comparable to brightness of an airplane light yet it's pulse was strong enough to increase brightness dramatically.  Light flashed a few times before it stopped flashing (only the small orange light left), continued on its path and then disappeared.  Altitude and distance is hard to estimate as nothing else was visible as being part of the light.  Planes fly low over location all the time and if the light was at the same distance and altitude of a plane the brightness of the large pulse would be the diameter of a plane.  I would of said it was just an ember that flew out of someone's chimney but consistency of velocity and brightness and repetition of pulses make me hope someone else besides my party saw it.   I have had the joy to say I have seen a UFO, but a member of my party claims he has and even he said what we saw was weird! ;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
3 orange ball lights.;2014-08-10 19:00:00;4 minutes;3 orange ball lights. My sister and I went out to the backyard to look at the supermoon, and we saw 3 orange, round lights, round-shaped light, over the 55 north freeway towards a Lincoln Avenue near Tustin Avenue & Collins,  We video taped them and we upload to youtube, they were hard to get on my cell phone but when we saw them, they were orange,  They look like orange stars but they were closer to the ground or actually over the neighbor's house, first 2 were side by side, then we saw a 3rd on bottom left & it accented towards the other 2, they they disappeared.

Four fireballs with long tails of fire sighted in the eastern sky from Orange County, CA.;2015-11-23 06:15:00;1 hour;Four fireballs with long tails of fire sighted in the eastern sky from Orange County, CA. I noticed the first fireball while driving east on Chapman ave in the city of Orange at around 06:15.  I watched it come in and out of sight for over thirty minutes as I rode to work with my friend in her car all the way to Santa Margerita.  The fireball was heading north/northeast and had a long tail of fire.  It was about 30 degrees high at first and gradually worked its way down to about 15 degrees high after about 35 to 40 minutes when it suddenly burned out fell straight towards the ground.  The fireball turned into a large ball of smoke before it fell, and the straight tail of fire was replaced by a serpentine smoke trail.  We picked up another worker in Santa Margerita and headed towards El Toro shortly after 07:00.  I saw another fireball identical to the first and at about the same trajectory that I had last seen the first one disappear.  I thought it was the same fireball initially, and I puzzled over how it could burn out, turn to smoke, and fall from the sky only to reappear ten minutes later.  I watched this second fireball flying in the sky for about five minutes before I lost sight of it behind the hills.  I sighted Two more fireballs within a minute of losing sight of the second.  Judging by the size of the fireballs and the length of the tails, these last two fireballs were much further away than the first two and lower in the sky, but they were all heading in the same direction.  I could see what looked like a bright white light with a concave shape in front of and separate from the fire tail following directly behind it a few times and only when it appeared to be heading towards me.  It looked like a shield or something that was suspended directly in front of and well forward of a craft to protect it from burning up as it entered the atmosphere from outer space.  It was most often heading away from me, though, and it looked like a ball of fire with a burning tail.  I thought they were meteors at first, but I found out that meteors are hard to see in the daylight and usually burn out within 30 seconds when I looked to see if any one reported seeing any meteors at that time.  I don't know what I saw, so I guess they are UFOs.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
