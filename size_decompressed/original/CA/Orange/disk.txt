saucer over Angel Stadium summer of 71 or 72;1971-06-15 12:00:00;1 minute;saucer over Angel Stadium summer of 71 or 72 It was the summer of 1971 or 1972 I was a small child about 6 or 7 I was in my backyard playing when I saw a silver saucer with different colored lights around the edge. Watched it fly north along the 57 freeway about a mile from where I was. Went in the house and started drawing pictures of the new kind of airplane that I saw in the sky. When my mother asked what I was drawing I told her that it was an airplane. She said airplanes don't look like that. I said the one I just saw did. We went outside, but by then it was gone. The sky was clear, and there was no mistake what I seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
In Broad daylight saucer appeared 50 feet above after I looked up to see what the humming and deep bass sound was;1979-01-01 17:00:00;20 minutes;In Broad daylight saucer appeared 50 feet above after I looked up to see what the humming and deep bass sound was It was a Friday afternoon and my 3 friends, (one a straight A student age 16, the other 2 were age 16 and average grades) and I had just pulled up in front of my girl friends house to pick her up and go out for the evening.  As I was getting out of my car I heard a humming sound with a deep vibration type bass included above me. I was across the street from my high school football field when Ilooked up and nearly had a heart attack when i saw the object hovering over the football field.  I was so scared and surprised at what I was looking at that I could barely get the words out to my 3 friends to get out of the car and look at this!  It was a Saucer shaped object of metalic looking structure with detail around it on the bottom that appeared to be holes of many in numbers and small. It was so close to the ground that I would say to be approxmatly 50ft. or so.  I at first as did my friends try to find an explanation that would discount what we were actually seeing and then we all gave into the reality of it and accepted the fact that we were wittnessing an event that would haunt our memories for the rest of our lives.  I and my friends got back into the car as the object began to move to the east very slowly.  We followed it for about 20 minutes as it gained altitude and speed until it in an instant it accelerated from an estimated altitude of around 200 to 300 feet to out of sight in 2 or 3 seconds or less.  I am a God loving rational individual and believe in everything in the Bible and that is what keeps me feeling safe from any possible event that could harm me while I await the rapture when Jesus returns. With that said I'm very interested in finding out what that was when I hope to make it to Heaven and ask the Lord my self. Until then I will only know what I saw and that the Lord didn't tell us about other life forms in the universe for reasons of his own. That I can accept and that is how I deal with that event!  Since that event I have seen questionable UFOs, but never anything as clearly visible in description as that object was and I hope to never experience anything like that again for now.

((HOAX??))  I went outside to enjoy the sun and I observed an unusual object in the daytime sky.;2010-09-02 13:00:00;1-2 mins;I went outside to enjoy the sun and i was observing a bird that was very very high in the sky.  I kept observing it because i had never seen a bird so high until it went below an even higher object and the bird flew away and i was fixated on this other object. The other object looked like no bird, but my first thought was it had to be one or a balloon.  I could see the sun reflecting off of it and the color was silver, the object was cigar saucer shaped.  The object appeared to be very small only about quarter inch so i knew it was very high up and was not a blimp or anything.  it was very shiny silver because the sun was reflecting off of it.  i have planes that go in the same direction where i was observing the object and i can tell you.  this was flying higher than any plane that passes by.  i saw no planes pass till after the sighting and they were 3 times lower than what this object appeared to be. At first it was very hard to see and i was shocked to see it so i looked away then tried to see if i could find the object and if it was still in the same place. it was.  I stared at the object for about 30 second before it started to move really really really fast, up down, left to right. like nothing i had ever seen before. faster than a plane, bird or anything. it was then i looked away again thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me.  so i looked away and tried to see if it was in the same vicinity.  it was. so i kept my eyes on it while it moved crazy fast.  I observed this for about 1 and a half to 2 minutes before i was in so much shock i couldn't believe it i had to look away again.   After i did that i tried to find it again but it was gone, it disappeared like it was never there but it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Time of sighting is unknown to us, although we have assigned an arbitrary time of 13:00 hrs..  We do not know what 25:00 hrs. means.  PD));33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
