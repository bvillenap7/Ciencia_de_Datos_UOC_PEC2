Very large blue flashing light falling fast from the sky in Orange, Califronia (twice in ten minutes).;2008-06-15 00:00:00;3 seconds;Very large blue flashing light falling fast from the sky in Orange, Califronia (twice in ten minutes). My family and I were sitting in the backyard when we all noticed a very large blue light falling from the sky.  It was moving very fast and looked large compared to an airplane or fireworks.  It was very bright and took about 3 seconds to fall before our view was blocked by other houses.  After about ten mintues, we were still outside and 4 of my other family members saw the same light again.  This time they said it fell straight down, instead of at an angle, and was moving faster.  This was nothing like anything we have ever seen before.  It looked like a shooting star but was about 100 times the size of one.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
