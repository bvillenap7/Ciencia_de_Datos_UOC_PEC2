Bright sparkling multi-colored object in the west/southwest sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Prboable sighting of a celestial body.  Sirius?  PD));2008-03-25 23:00:00;continuous;Bright sparkling multi-colored object in the west/southwest sky. Seen in the west-southwest sky.  Bright sparkling colors.  Did not appear to be moving.  Sparkled like a diamond with multiple colors brighter than all other lights in the sky.  Suspected it may be a planet but didn't look like they normally do--much brighter and many more bright colors.  Used binoculars and compared to other planets/stars!!  Would like to know what it was??? ((NUFORC Note:  Prboable sighting of a celestial body.  Probably Sirius.  PD);33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
