While driving W/B on the Garden Grove freeway 1 mile E/of the Santa Ana freeway in Orange, CA. in my 1990 Dodge B-250 Ram van, I observed a green sphere with an orange tail come into view at the top of my  windshield (approx. 45 degrees above the horizon).  It was shooting straight down and disappeared in less than a 1/2 second at approx. 15 degrees above the horizon.  I was heading due west (270 degrees magnetic) and the object was observed approximately 290 degrees bearing from my position.  It's size was approximately 1/4 to 1/5 the apparent diameter of the moon. I am fairly certain of the date, but it might have been 1 week earlier (11/29/98) at the same time.  I was driving the same route both weeks and I can'pinpoint which Sunday night it was observed.  I am certain of the time, however.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642

Ran into house to get camera and when i returned object had moved approx 45 degrees to the north east.  Called friend in Covina and he could also see object.  Looked like a very bright line of light, not cloud reflection.  Helicopter passed by but much closer than object was.  Returned inside to confirm sighting with roommate but when returned, the object was gone.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
8 fireballs seen in Orange County, CA.;2012-07-07 21:15:00;10-15 minutes;8 fireballs seen in Orange County, CA. Roommate A was outside in her backyard at 9:15 pm.  She looked up and saw three bright orange lights rising into the sky from the southeast, in the same pattern.  They looked like they were on fire, then burned out, and then fell.  She called her three roommates to look outside and they saw five more of these 'fireballs' rise, go out, and fall, following in the same approximate pattern.  The fireballs were slightly larger than a star, and moving much quicker than an airplane in the distance. Observers are all female, early 20's, recent college graduates.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Three orange-red fireballs, coming from horizon and following upward-right trajectory then fading away, one appearing after the other;2014-11-22 21:34:00;10-15 minutes;Three orange-red fireballs, coming from horizon and following upward-right trajectory then fading away, one appearing after the other 	On 11/22/14, while standing outside facing West, a silent fireball of orange/red color appeared from the horizon at 21:34.  Over the course of a maximum of 4 minutes, it slowly (floating like a lantern) went diagonally up to the right then, at about half way up, it slowly faded then disappeared.  Within less than a minute, another fireball appeared, following the exact same trajectory, then faded.  About a minute later, a third fireball appeared, floated the same path, then faded away.  In total, there were three fireballs within 10 to 15 minutes.  We took a video but it is such poor quality that it doesn't seem worth sending. 	The three observers are mostly novices to astronomy.  Two of the three have, on multiple occasions, seen unidentifiable objects in the sky.  However, they have never seen fireballs before the previously mentioned incident, only round objects which emitted a red light which varied in intensity.  They moved in a way which did not correlate with the current wind direction.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
