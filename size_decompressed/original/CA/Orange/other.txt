Oddly shaped object hovering above Orange County, California, then flying off under power.;2006-10-03 23:25:00;10 minutes;Oddly shaped object hovering above Orange County, California, then flying off under power. We saw what we thought might be a mickey mouse balloon floating in the sky.  It was either light in color or appeared so against the dark sky.  We thought of a mickey mouse balloon because it seemed to have bulges coming from it and seemed to be tumbling, so that the bulges alternated sides of the object.  It was odd, though, because it didn't seem to be moving in any sort of wind as you would expect a balloon to do.  If it was a balloon, it would have had to be only a few hundred feet up considering the apparent size to us.  Eventually, we started seeing some light coming from it.  The light was red and intermittent.  At the same time the object started to appear to move upward, as it seemed smaller and smaller.  Soon it headed north and moved more like a conventionaly plane.  It still had some light coming from it, but it didn't look regular like you would expect for running lights of an airplane.  My eyes may have been playing tricks on me, but I thought I saw some shimmering intermittent lights, possibly blue, which appeared to surround the object on one side for very brief flashes.  As we watched the object move off to the north (by this time it was simply a light), it appeared to possibly interact with another light of similar intensity.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
blue and red row of lights flying unusaul pattern over orange county, califonia;2009-07-14 23:35:00;35 seconds;blue and red row of lights flying unusaul pattern over orange county, califonia Tuesday July 14 th at 11:35 pm pst, city of orange California .I witnessed an unexplained craft flying a very unusual pattern in the sky. I am close to a flight path for a local airport but orange county airport (sna) closes for in coming flights at 11 pm pst. I am used to seeing jets, helicopters, and other small planes, and know their decent patterns. And I know what their landing lights and beacon lights look like. I have never witnessed anything that could fly this pattern so quickly and fly off into the horizon so fast. The craft resembled a police car light bar but instead of flashing lights , had steady on blue on each end with a row of steady red in the center. I had a clear view and there was no cloud cover, no other signs of aircraft, I was facing east with  a big bright moon to my right  towards the south at 2  o clock in the sky, and telephone lines in front of me so it was clear to see the unusual pattern. The craft was over head flying to my 12 o clock position, I then flew a 90 degree turn to the south at the 3 o’clock position, then diagonally  down to the 7 o’clock position, then quickly straight up to the 12 o clock position, then it flew a big arc, from 12 o’clock to 9 o’clock, then another arc from 9 o’clock to the horizon straight in front of me, disappearing. I called to my wife to come out and see as It was happening. The incident lasted about 35 seconds , it was gone by the time she came out the door. All off this was here in the city, so maybe someone else saw it I hope.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Bright white object very large that traveled in the sky unbelievably fast in many different directions.;2010-07-18 00:05:00;5 minutes;Bright white object very large that traveled in the sky unbelievably fast in many different directions. I went into the backyard just after midnight to take clothes out of dryer.  I looked up at the sky and spotted what I thought was a shooting star.  I was very bright and falling very quickly.   It suddenly stopped and started to fade away.  As it faded away, I saw what looked like 3 red lights in a triangle formation.   Then the white lights got very bright again and looked like LED lights.  When lit fully it almost looked like an X, but curved.  It looked far away but very big, probably the size of a large plane.   It moved faster then anything that I could imagine.  I watched it go from one part of the sky to another in seconds.  It continued to fade away and I would see the red lights again and then get very bright white again.   I really can’t stress the speed that it was traveling and the size of it.  There is no way that something that large should be able to move that fast.   After 4 minutes I decided to run in and grab my video camera.  I was able to get a! bout 45 seconds of it on film and it does show the speed that the object moved at.   It went up and down and across and zig-zag. I still don’t know what exactly I saw, but I do know that there was something physically out there.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Extremely loud noise followed by a falling red, white, and green orb soon after blue light flies by overhead.;2015-10-13 21:04:00;30 minutes;Extremely loud noise followed by a falling red, white, and green orb soon after blue light flies by overhead. 	There was an extremely loud noise overhead, similar to that of bombs dropping from the sky.  There were no airplanes present above at the time and the sky was clear.  Five to ten minutes after the loud noise, there was a red orb which fell from an extremely high altitude (similar to that or above which planes fly) and soon turned to a white light, and then a green light lasting about fifteen seconds.   Fifteen to twenty minutes after the orb of colors fell, a bright blue light streaked by lasting no more than five seconds.  In this short amount of time, the light had gone from my current location to the ocean which is about seventeen miles.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
