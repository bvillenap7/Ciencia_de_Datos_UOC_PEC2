Two objects flying in formation over Orange County;2000-06-25 21:23:00;15 seconds;Two objects flying in formation over Orange County At about 9:15pm my family had concluded dinner at a friend's house and I was trying to correct the sighting scope on my friend's telescope, so that my son could use it more easily.  I had used some distant city lights from his hilltop ome, and had then turned the telescope East to run a test against the brightest object in the Eastern sky.  The brightest star (I could probably figure it out on sky charts) visible through the city lights stood about 30-35 degrees above the horizon, due East. As I positioned the scope so that the target came into the cross-hairs of the sighting scope, my son exited the house and stated that it was 9:23, and he needed to get home to study.  At that precise moment, two faint lights, similar to stars traversed the field of view, due North to due South, of the sighting scope above and below the target star.  Using the moon as a reference of 5%, I would estimate that the two lights were about 2 - 3% apart, with the leading light about 1% below the trailing light.  When they passed above and below the target star, the target star did not blink out. I looked around the sighting scope to see if I could pick up the stars with my naked eye.  I was not wearing my glasses, but could make out a slight, dull blur about where the two lights should be.  I returned to the sighting scope and picked the lights back up once again.  They continued to travel in the same direction and at the same speed.  I called my son over and pointed up to the are where the lights should be, hoping to take advantage of his better eyesight.  He could not find the objects before they disappeared behind the roofline. This house sits right amidst the approach lanes into John Wayne Airport in Orange County.  At the same time, about 6 airplanes were in the sky for comparison.  If these were aircraft lights, the aircraft would have to be at 30,000 feet  (not the couple of thousand that is typical for that close to the airport), be two planes flying in locked formation (to maintain position with respect to one another) and not one (because the target star was not obscured by their passing), and each would have to have a single warning light (white) in operation. Has I been able to see the objects from horizon to horizon in open land, it would have taken the objects about 30 - 45 seconds to travers the entire sky at their observed speed.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
flashing lights;2001-07-05 23:00:00;few seconds;flashing lights I was sitting in my living room with my sisters boyfriend and we were watching tv.  We saw the east facing window light up with a blue double flash. My sister's boyfriend said he saw the same thing either the night before or two nights before. He didn't know what it was.  I was talking to a friend about it and she said she saw something similar. She was outside at a gas station and said it lit up part of the sky but in an area. She said it was in the direction that i lived in. She saw a quick double or triple flash. I didn't see any object, just the lights.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Bright Copper Glowing Object, emits burst of light and debris or object is deployed and falls toward northern Orange County;2006-09-02 20:26:00;3-4 seconds;Bright Copper Glowing Object, emits burst of light and debris or object is deployed and falls toward northern Orange County My significant other and I were going to a friends house in the city of orange, as we were knocking their door, I looked up to check out the moon on the southern sky. (I Had read the day before in the Orange County Register that a European Satellite was being made to crash land on the moon and that the Impact Flash would be seen from Orange County) Since I did not see anything different with the moon, I scanned the whole night sky for any stars or planes or any other peculiar object.  To my surprise, I saw a bright Star just north of 90 degrees (from the top of my head)  At first I thougt it Was Mars or Jupiter because It gave out a really bright orange, almost Copper like Glow. As I watched it, all of a sudden it got really bright, and then it seemed to have had a burst of light from one side, and something like fire or some debris seemed to be expulsed from it and began to freefall, and as it did, it began to loose its glow. If you ever seen fireworks as the sparks began to freefall and loose their fire glow, that is almost what it looked like, but this definitely was thousands of feet up in the air. My Significant other saw it too, and she thought it was high enough to have been a satellite, but neither of us have seen a satellite that stays static up in space.  I don't know if this bright object that we saw, was deploying another object or if it had been hit by something else causing it to be damaged and loose material from it. this happened just in a matter of seconds, by the time it was over, my friend had opened the door, and when we looked up again it was gone. I believe that if whatever came off that object crashed or landed on earth, it must have been happened in the Yorba linda or Fullerton Hills in Orange County.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Light like a plane but moved like something really strange!;2007-04-10 22:00:00;4 minutes;Light like a plane but moved like something really strange! April 10, 2007 10:04 pm  We were just out in our front yard in the city of Orange in Orange County (the OC) California.  We were emptying our trash when we saw a light in the sky off in the distance (North) that resembled the light of a helicopter.  However, it was moving around in circles, loops, and flips at such a high rate of speed that both we and our neighbors were sure it wasnâ€™t any kind of normal aircraft.  After about 3 minutes, it steadied itself and continued off westward as normal looking as your every day plane.  Anyone else see it???;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Point of light in daytime sky over Orange, CA;2010-01-02 12:20:00;5-6 minutes;Point of light in daytime sky over Orange, CA I was in the process of removing our exterior Christmas lights when I noticed a light in the sky to the North moving South.  It appeared in luminosity similar to a star or satellite.  In addition, it appeared to be of very high altitude, again similar to a satellite.  This was apparent as the jet plane was passing from East to West at a high altitude at the same time I noted the unknown light.  The plane was crossing the sky at an approximate 50 degree relative elevation from my vantage point, and the unknown light was at an approximate 70 degree relative elevation when first sighted. My initial thought was this was a satellite, as I have seen these many times at night and on occasion during the day.  However, this light did not behave as other satellites I have observed.  The light moved relatively slow in comparison.  The light took approximately 30 seconds to move directly overhead.  It then stopped for approximately 3 to 5 seconds.   The light very slightly grew in size and brightness during this period of first sight to the stop over head.  I also had called my wife out to see it during this period.   She also observed the light.  I asked to bring the camcorder to see if we could get the light on video. The light then moved in westerly direction.  Again, slower than a plane or satellite.  We tried to film the light with two camcorders but are unsure if we captured it (we have not reviewed the tapes as of this reporting).  The light continued on its westerly course for approximately 3 minutes before I noted it was moving slightly to the west/south/west (say 15 degrees from true west).  The light was approximately at 75 to 80 degrees relative elevation.  Please note I can assure the light was very distant as it was obscured for a second or two by part of high cloud. I continued to intermittently observe the light for another minute.  The light was dimming and becoming increasingly harder to spot.  It appeared to traveling directly away (i.e. out rather than in a particular direction).;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
strange light seen over Orange California;2010-07-16 03:50:00;10 minutes;Strange light seen over Orange California A bright light appeared from the east near roof-top level at a distance of a few miles.   At first it seemed to be an airplane heading toward nearby John Wayne Airport and even turned in that direction like a normal airplane.  There were no green or red lights, only a single star-like white light.   After turning to the south, the light dimmed and then made an abrupt turn to the north and brightened to about 1 magnitude or brighter.   The object began a series of acrobatic maneuvers that an airplane could not perform.  It reversed direction almost instantly, swooped down very rapidly, and climbed just as quickly.  This pattern of movement continued during the entire episode.   Although the object seemed to stay in one part of the sky, it slowly drifted toward the east and finally disappeared from view.   I watched the object for about 10 minutes.   While observing the strange motions, I saw an early-morning jogger come by and pointed out the object to him.  He joined me in my observations until the object passed from view.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Triangle lights hovering over Cowen Heights;2011-04-04 06:00:00;5 min;Triangle lights hovering over Cowen Heights There was a craft hovering above the back side of Cowan Heights in Orange, Ca.  It wasn't moving or making any sound and had 3 bright lights in the shape of a triangle.   It was not a helicopter or any remote controlled vehicle.  It was hovering about 500 feet above the ground.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Ball of light over Southern California.;2013-05-26 03:45:00;5-10 minutes;Ball of light over Southern California I watched a ball of light move across the sky for a few minutes, at an estimated distance of a few miles.   I watched a ball of light move across the sky with multiple seemingly random movements.  The light would change direction instantly, rise and fall in altitude.  I ran back to my house and called my wife outside and we both watched the light for a few more minutes before it traveled south and out of our view.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Light in the sky dissappears after slowly flying towards the area where i live.;2013-07-04 20:45:00;3 minutes;Light in the sky dissappears after slowly flying towards the area where i live. My son and I were out at night, around 8:45pm.  We went to the elementary school down the street from my house to view the fireworks that were going to be lit from the high school a few blocks down.   We were sitting, facing south when I caught in my eye, from the southeast, a light coming towards us high up in the sky.  I didnâ€™t think anything as our neighborhood is in the flight path of our local airport.   There had obviously been lights all evening however, this light didnâ€™t have any blinking lights coming from it so I knew it wasnâ€™t an airplane or helicopter.  I then looked away for a few seconds and when I looked back it appeared brighter and bigger than before.   I then took my eyes off it again and I looked towards the west where I saw another light that looked just like this one, this other light had a blinking light though.   So I looked back at the unusual light and right as I tried to tell my son to look, the light started to dim fast until it fully faded a! way and left a small ball of fog behind.   I kept my eye on that area to see if I could possibly spot anything else and was unsuccessful. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Floating orange ball of light, then zipped out into space.;2016-06-03 22:00:00;15 minutes;Floating orange ball of light, then zipped out into space Was smoking a cig, saw a orange ball of light about the same size of light you'd see from a low plane, but it was orange not white and there were no flashing lights.   Watched the light fly slowy across the sky, and then it stopped and moved backwards, the way it was coming from.  Repeated to hover and shift slowly through the sky, it was flickering like a star but not a plane or helicopter,   I  watched the object stop moving and a white line showed up below it, and it started to get smaller and as it was getting smaller the light got less bright, and all of the sudden, it vanished.   While watching it, I looked around for someone else looking but the only other things that saw were the two random cats I saw sitting in the street staring at the sky.  Sighted near heart park in Orange CA, object was floating in the sky somewhat toward Angel Stadium. Anyone else see this??;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Red orbs over Orange, CA.;2017-03-29 20:00:00;10 minutes;Red orbs over Orange CA We walked out onto the patio and 3 red glowing lights were in the sky.  One was very large, the other two slightly smaller.  No sound and they weren't moving at all.  Then a 4th one floated up and also stayed still.  All of them were bright red, like the brake lights of a car.  And they had large red glows/auras around them.  I heard someone down the street yell, What is that? I tried to take a pic but they only showed up as white dots.  They were there for a good 10 minutes, then they faded out and disappeared.
