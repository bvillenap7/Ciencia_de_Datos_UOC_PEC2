Black sphere seen at 400 feet AGL  moving slow at dusk;2004-07-13 20:00:00;10 min.;Black sphere seen at 400 feet AGL  moving slow at dusk Observed at 8:00 pm pacific time. Just before dusk I was driving on a surface street heading southwest when I saw a round sphere type object at approximately 400 feet AGL due East from me.The object was 500 yards from me at the time. It was black and appeared to be spinning on an axis and about 6-8 feet in diameter. At the time I was driving about 40-45 mph as the object was also moving at least that speed parallel to my direction. As I made a left hand turn on another street it darted eastbound at the same speed. I tried to follow this object and pulled into a parking lot to observe its direction. For a minute or two it stayed in one place and around 500-600 feet AGL. I got a couple pictures of it before it moved off in a easterly direction. I picked up a family member within a minute from my location at the time, and we went towards the last known direction it headed. We saw it once more now at around two thousand feet AGL and watched it move eastbound in a steady climb through three thousand feet AGL.It appeared to have a blinking white strobe that blinked once every 2 minutes. We then left the area.It was now 8:15 pm.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Glowing orb being chased by two jets;2015-09-17 19:48:00;Few minutes;Glowing orb being chased by two jets My son 9 years, old, came running into the house in a huge panic scared that he witnessed a large glowing orb being chased by two military jets.  He said the jets were on either side of the orb chasing at high speed.  About the time he saw them I was sitting in my neighbors' house and loud jet like sounds stopped our conversation and we commented how loud that was and never heard a ghetto bird (helicopter) that loud.   We are in the flight path of john Wayne flight path so he knows what airplanes and helicopters are.  He said the jets were black/dark in color.   He has NEVER made anything like this up and he was truly scared and out of breath.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
