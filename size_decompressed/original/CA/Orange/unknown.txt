Mysterious Rays Light Up Night Sky in Orange, California;2010-10-02 12:15:00;2 min.;Mysterious Rays Light Up Night Sky in Orange, California So...Friday night my boyfriend and I were in Orange County visiting old friends at a kegger. We left the party at around midnight, October 2nd. After picking up some In-n-Out on Chapman Ave. we headed up Chapman towards the 241 to Riverside. My boyfriend was passed out drunk, and I was D.D. As soon as we went over the top of the hill, right after the Orange Hill Restaurant street ight, I saw these beautiful rays of light flashing upwards towards the sky. I want to describe it as similar to the lights you see at a car dealer, but there were way too many of them! So my best example is when you see in E.T. movies, a UFO sitting in the middle of the forest and it's lights are shining throughthe trees in a somewhat circular,waving motion?  Hope that makes sense. But NE ways, it light up the whole night sky, and it was coming from in front and to the left of me.  So my best guess is that it was coming from somewhere in between the Irvine Park and Santiago Oaks area! .  I saw the lights constantly moving from the top of the hill until right before I got to Santiago Canyon College.  My vision of the source of the lights was somewhat obscured by all the tall trees in the area. But whatever it was, it was very bright and had to have at least 5 lights around it to account for how many rays I saw shooting upwards. The color of the rays went from a pure white to a faint blue.;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
Stationary object turns into red, then blue and then a glowing white and duplicates process and then flies overhead.;2014-04-09 20:40:00;15-30 seconds;Stationary object turns into red, then blue and then a glowing white and duplicates process and then flies overhead. I was outside on my balcony and saw a bright red line in the sky.  I looked at it and it looked like it was the size of a plane about to land, but not the correct lighting.  It then changed to blue and then a glowing white quickly then back to red.    This happened a second time and then the stationary object moved and flew overhead at a moderate pace while red in color.    I live in a heavy flight area near John Wayne Airport and this was not in particular flight pattern that is normal to the area.   In addition, approximately 3-5 minutes later 2 helicopters that were not very visible, appeared to be similar to the military ones that fly overhead to the base near Palm Springs flew overhead.   I'm sure there's some sort of explanation, however I can't explain it!;33.8000726415093;-117.851552122642
