Both were green in color.They seemed to be conected at a certain length and i knew that by the speed it was going and its altitude it was pretty big. I was about to go to sleep when I saw this object fliying at a slow speed. I was curius because it seemed to be an airplane going at a low altitude so i went outside to see if it was going to land nearby. Once I was outside I noticed the object wasnt at a low altitude and that it was bigger than I had thought. I called my brother and sister. The object seemed to have two lights on each end and it was going at a north-eastern direction. It was at about the altitude of a normal cloud. The light on the left was blinking every second and the light on the right  was just on. They were both green lights.;36.0883;-119.5651
