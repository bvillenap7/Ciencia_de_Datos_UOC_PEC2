It looked just like the ISS but a little dimmer.  I watched it travel straight east until my view was blocked by trees in the distance.  The even lasted approximately 20-30 seconds.   I then went into the house to check the ISS sighting location for my town.  The ISS is visible from my location at 3:39 a.m. tomorrow morning!  This light was about 3/4 the illumination of the ISS.  It also seemed to be in our atmosphere. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.5314;-122.258
