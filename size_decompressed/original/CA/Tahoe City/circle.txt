Out of nowhere we saw a bright white light appear next to Venus. It was on the right side and about the same size and appearance as Venus.  It stayed there a couple minutes, then backed up. It took off very fast away from us behind Venus.  As it took off, it zigzagged up above and to the left of Venus. Soon after it turned red.  It kept speeding away unlike any speed I have ever observed.  The red dot became tinier and tinier until it disappeared.  It was the strangest thing we’ve ever seen.  We’d like to know what it was.;39.1806;-120.1445
