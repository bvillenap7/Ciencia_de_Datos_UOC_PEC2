I SAW A LIGHT WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A STAR BUT IT WAS MOVING IN A N TO S COURSE.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of satellites and star??  PD));2008-03-24 00:40:00;60 MINUTES;I SAW A LIGHT WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A STAR BUT IT WAS MOVING IN A NORTH TO SOUTH COURSE, SO I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A SATELITE. IT THEN STARTED MOVING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. VERY SLOWLY BUT IT IS DEFINETLY MOVING BUT NOT IN AN ORBIT FORMATION IT IS MOVING UP AND DOWN AND SIDE TO SIDE BUT IT IS STAYING IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA. I LOOK AT THE STARS OFTEN AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. I THOUGHT IT MAY HAVE BEEN AN AIRCRAFT BUT IT WAS TOO HIGH UP. I JUST CAN'T TELL WHAT IT IS. THERE IS A LIGHT WHICH WAS THE SAME BRIGHTNESS AS A STAR BUT AS IT GOT CLOSER OR SEEMED TO GET CLOSER IT GOT DIMMER. MOVEMENT IS STEADY AND NO JERKING AROUND BUT IT MOVEMENT IS VERY SLOW AND IN ALL DIRECTIONS. I LIVE IN LAKE TAHOE AND I WAS LOOKING OUT MY BACK DECK INTO THE EAST TOWARDS RENO OR CARSON CITY NEVADA, IF YOU WERE IN EITHER OF THOSE CITIES I WOULD SAY IT WAS STRAIGHT ABOVE THEM. BUT FOR ME IT WAS SOUTHEAST FROM TAHOE CITY CALIFORNIA. I COULDN'T GET A PICTURE OF IT BECAUSE IT WAS TO FAR AWAY AND I DON'T HAVE A TELESCOPE TO SEE ANY DETAILS.
