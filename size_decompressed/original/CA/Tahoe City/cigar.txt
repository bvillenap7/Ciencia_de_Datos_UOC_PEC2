fast moving object with flashing lights disappeared in 4-5 seconds;2009-02-27 01:30:00;5 seconds;fast moving object with flashing lights disappeared in 4-5 seconds I am a 49 year old father of four.  This was my first sighting.   I walked out on deck to have a cigarette and noticed towards the west through the pine trees an object with lights flashing moving towards the south.  It was completely silent.  It moved in one direction for approximately 4-5 seconds and then disappeared.   It was flying somewhere near the top of Ward Creek Blvd.  It was moving too fast and too low to the mountain tops to be any type of plane.  The lights were much brighter and way different than any plane I've ever seen at night.   Normally up here it is very quiet at night and you can hear the commercial flights flying overhead.  I heard no sound what-so-ever, even after it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.1806;-120.1445
