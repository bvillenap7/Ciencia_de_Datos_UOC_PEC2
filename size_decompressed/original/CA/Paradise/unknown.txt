I woke up around 0245, couldn't sleep so I went into living room to read for awhile.  I heard a soft humming sound outside that had two long periods and one short period of duration.  Unfortunately, I did not go out to look.  Unfortunate because I understand a lady may have seen what I heard on the same night--tape played on Art Bell Sunday night.  She was one ridge to the west in Paradise.  We have had other instances of ufo here too.  Had a bright square shaped light in the garden area a year ago--didn't go out to investigate it either--both my wife and I saw it.;39.7579;-121.6131
