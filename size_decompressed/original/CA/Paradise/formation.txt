But it's not necessarily the stars I'm looking at. I'm looking for moving objects. I've had an Interest in astronomy for at least 25 years. I'm 37 now. Well anyway looking for moving objects all these nights finally paid off. I was standing out there in the backyard looking up in the general northern direction. It wasn't long when I saw three steady,star blue lights. They were in a triangular formation (figure 1.)  traveling slowly to a slight south-east direction. light->o / fig. 1 /\ /  \ light->o    \ light->o ((NUFORC Note:  Diagram did not survive transfer to database.
