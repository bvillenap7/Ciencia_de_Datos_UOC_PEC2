circle of light at low altitude, low speed shot out reddish flourescent tube of light;2007-12-01 04:05:00;1-2 min;circle of light at low altitude, low speed shot out reddish flourescent tube of light Shape - Spherical or circle (other object - tubular) Color - White light (other object - reddish orangish brownish - flourescent) Size - 1/4 size of full moon (longer than first object)  At 4:05 in the morning (I don't remember the exact date, Dec. '07 approx.)I observed a white light coming through the tree tops. It was a spherical or circle of bright white light.  It flew right over my head at a steady slow speed at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet! There was absolutely NO NOISE! It came from the WNW and disappeared in the ESE direction.  Right before it disappeared over the tree line a reddish brown tube of light either flew right below it or it was shot out of the bottom of the UFO.  The tube shot out at a very high speed but it was lit up like a flourescent tube and it looked like there were 2 sections to the tube.  I could definetly see a black line in the middle of the tube.  Anyway the reason that I did not send this info before is because I didn't think anyone would believe me.  I haven't been to your site in months and today I saw the sighting in NY in July that is almost identical to what I saw.  I have seen other strange things before and I have never reported them but this one was very close and different from anything that I have ever seen. During this sighting tears flowed from my eyes and all I could say was OH MY GOD over and over again.  Unless our government has a craft that can float through the air without sound and be lit up like this was (and also shoot out that weird tube) I would have to say that this was not of this world.
