a white contrail fixed in size, shape and consistency.;2005-03-15 16:00:00;15 minutes?;a white contrail fixed in size, shape and consistency. I looked up while still driving as I noticed what looked like a contrail. When I parked and got out of the car in the KMART parking lot, I looked up again and noted that the contrail hadn't begun to lengthen, nor had it begun to dissapate like they always do (I am an airforce brat, and know what a contrail looks like). So my attention was suddenly very focused. I stood there and watched what looked like a solid contrail slowly move from the northeast to the west (I think anyway, but I am not the best at direction, I use the sun to judge). I also noticed that despite the sunny day, and the position of the sun, I couldn't see a tiny shiny point at the head of the contrail like there would normally be, as the sun reflects off of the metal of a plane, because there was no plane, and what I was looking at, along with about 6 others now, was something other than a plane, or its contrail.. A moving contrail fixed in size, shape and consistency. so it was white, with a slightly transparent look to it and a blurred perimeter. I cannot judge the distance. after about 15 minutes it was out of site. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));39.7579;-121.6131
