I was awake at 3am to give my sister her medicine. When I went into the kitchen to rinse the medical supplies I saw due west 2 parallel thick lines of yellow white light at a slight angle. The light was not the same bright white color of the stars. The one on top appeared to have a ball of light at the head of the line. They did not move. I watched them for about 10 minutes to see if there was any movement. There was none. I thought they might be shooting stars or comets with tails. The lines were uniformly thick though and the same length. The outlines were fuzzy and not sharp. I went outside in front to get a closer look and then went into the backyard to see if I could still see them. They did not move or change. I watched for about 30 minutes and then went back inside the house. I watched them from my bedroom window which is in the front of the house where the kitchen is. They never moved or changed. I finally fell asleep and when I woke up it was still dark and they were gone.;39.7579;-121.6131
Multiple aircraft;2011-07-20 22:00:00;1 min;Multiple aircraft I previously reported a circle of light (Dec. 2007?) that flew over my head at 4:00 in the a.m. to this site.  This circle of light was flying below 1000 feet, no noise, did not emit light, was approx. 1/4 the size of the moon and ejected (or maybe something shot at it and missed) a fluorescent light (orange/red tube segmented with a black line)from the bottom of it.  I told my sister all about this light a couple of years ago. This same sister was staying with me in July of this year.  One night (approx. 7-20-11)she woke me up to tell me that the light was flying over (22:00 hrs appox.). We both went out on the deck but it was gone.  She was pointing in the direction that it was going (same as 2007 sighting - traveling from NNW to SSE). While she was pointing south I happened to glance up (north) and saw a strange craft. This craft was right above our heads and flying from the SSW to NNE.  It was flying below 1000 feet AND THERE WAS NO NOISE.  It had 3 lights on it (red,green and white) it resembled an large airplane but it was way too bulky (?) to be a airplane in my opinion.  I could see a fuselage and wings but the wings were as thick and as big as the fuselage which doesn' t make any sense to me. The whole body of the craft looked like two rectangle boxes stuck together like a cross.  I could see the craft so well because IT WAS THAT LOW and SLOW!  This craft disappeared over the tree line and about 10 seconds later there was a very loud rumble (sort of like thunder but not) that lasted about 20 seconds.  The loud rumble came from the direction that the craft disappeared (NNE), NOT from overhead. Anyway, about 1-2 min. after that we could hear what sounded like military jets screaming out of Beale AFB (approx. 50 miles S of us).  It sounded like 2 jets but we only saw one fly overhead about 5-10 min. later. The craft my sister initially saw sounded exactly like the one that I saw in 2007. A circle of white light about 1/4 the size of a full moon, no noise, did not emit light and flying very low. I don't know what we saw in July, but it was very strange.  Sorry for the length of this. As we were watching this craft fly over the tree line ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.7579;-121.6131
