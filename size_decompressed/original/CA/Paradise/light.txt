I saw a pulsating light , marrow white in color traveling north to south around 2300 hours;2002-06-18 22:57:00;three minutes;I saw a pulsating light , marrow white in color traveling north to south around 2300 hours Yup, it's me again, ((name deleted)). Well, I was outside taking a break loking about the stars. Next thing I know, there was this pulsating light moving in a straighter north to south direction. It was a bit closer parallel to the west. I know it wasn't a satellite because they don't have lights. I also really don't believe it was a standard aircraft because they have lights other than white. they have red and/or blue  lights. Furthermore, even IF they did have just a white light, it wouldn't pulsate nor would it be semi-dull, bone marrow white as such what I witnessed. I know it seems crazy that I saw two sightings 23 hours apart, but I know what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed on June 18, but the ISS was visible from California at approximately 21:13 hrs. (Pacific) on June 17.

Two bright lights following each other seen in the sky when no stars were present.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of ISS.  PD));2009-09-08 20:00:00;3-4 Minutes;Two bright lights following each other seen in the sky when no stars were present Two bright lights were seen flying over the West Feather River canyon branch in Paradise, CA.  One light was dimmer than the other and they seemed to be following be following each other.   There were no stars in the sky, and they could not have been domestic aircraft, because they were both solid and steady lights.

2 lights, 1st one NOT blinking being followed by 2nd one with blinking lights (probable military aircraft);2009-11-16 19:57:00;10-15 seconds;2 lights, 1st one NOT blinking being followed by 2nd one with blinking lights (probable military aircraft) 2 lights traveling from NNW to SSE.  1st light was light red/orange high altitude, constant light (no blinking light). 2nd light (probable military fighter) was white with blinking lights (red mostly)seemed to be at the same altitude.  Both lights were traveling at a very high speed, much much faster than commercial jets.  The 2nd light seemed to be trailing the 1st and was being outrun by the 1st light.   I am an ex-military wife who has lived on Air Force Bases and Naval bases so I am very familiar with military aircraft and how fast they travel.  These lights were going VERY fast and the military aircraft was not catching up to the 1st light but was obviously following it.

Swarm of lights.;2015-09-27 20:30:00;15 minutes;Swarm of lights. We were watching the blood moon eclipse and witnessed lights moving at high speed high in the sky passing each other very close scattered around the moon, above us, in the far distance past the moon.   No doubt about they were ufo's and  definitely not your regular aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.7579;-121.6131
