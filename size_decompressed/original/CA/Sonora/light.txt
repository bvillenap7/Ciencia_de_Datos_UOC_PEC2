I lost sight of the object behind a tree. I was just starting to put my telescope away when I saw a light.  It was a red light (not flashing, brighter than Mars) about ten degrees above the horizon, in the East heading towards the South with a slight and steady decline in a altitude.  At this time I cought it in the scope of my telescope for a second or two (It still appeared to be a red object as I earlier described it) but then I lost sight of the object behind a tree.  I ran up the street but could not see it.  I then saw a star over lapped (for the lack of a better word) with a redder star in the ESE. At this time I was so fritened about it that I just decided to forget about until know.;37.9998;-120.3267
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Large bluish/white light and possible abduction.;2004-04-03 19:15:00;three minutes;Large bluish/white light and possible abduction. Full Description of event/sighting: I was facing east, the full moon was above and to my right. From my left, overhead, a large bluish-white light was passing over me. It was beautiful! It moved rather sedately, and slowly seemed to rock to the left and right as it flew over.  It passed right in front of the full moon and kept going towards the north. Object was in sight for over three minutes. Other aircraft (definitely planes with FAA mandated blinking lights) were flying in the area just east of the object. They definitely were higher in the air than the object. It seemed no more than two football fields-length from me. The light was very, very large. It looked to be dime-sized. I can't imagine how big it would have been if it had been closer!  Thank you to the witness for their report.  Dear Brian,  I just sent a UFO report to your website. It happened about an hour ago.  Photos of the marks on the man's body can be found at:  Also, last night my brother had new marks on his back. Pictures attached, as well as a mark or scar behind his left ear. He has NO memory of getting them. No nausea, no pain, he was looking in the mirror when he noticed them. They're are more on his back now. If you compare the pictures I sent you before, you will see the difference. I don't know why they would focus on my brother's spine, but he was in a motor bike accident when he was sixteen. He is now 22 this month. He swerved to avoid a dog and hit a tree. He wasn't wearing his helmet and ended up in a coma for two months. He has mobility in his left leg, but not much control over it. His left hand still spasms. He had nerve damage. He walks with a pronounced limp. I wonder what they are doing to him. It is frustrating! He says that he doesn't mind if you use his pictures.

It was a very clear sky with many stars visible. I looked up to look at the stars and observed an incredibly fast, star like object about the size and luminocity of Venus shoot across the sky from South to North at amazing speed. (estimate? 3000+mph!) It all happened in less than a second, but I can be certain of what I saw.  Hope this is of interest,;37.9998;-120.3267

The way that ot moved and dissapereared was unlike anything a conventional aircraft could do and it's trajectory was so short and strange that it couldn't have been a shooting star. Aircraft was in the vicinity at the time.;37.9998;-120.3267
Venus type light arcing across sky and sky flashes.;2007-02-28 18:43:00;1 min;Venus type light arcing across sky and sky flashes. We walked out of our house and I immediately saw a very bright light slowly moving across the dark sky.  It was roughly the same size and intensity as Venus (which was visible off to my left) travelling from north west to south east.  No aircraft lights were seen on or near the object as would be expected from a conventional aircraft and before leaving our sight it blinked very quickly once.  We drove off in the direction of the light but never saw it again.   The night before we were out walking in a snowfall and saw five bright blue flashes that lit up the entire sky (cloud covered).  These appeared to not come from any one point but seem to light up the entire sky like a flash bulb.  This after a relatively quiet time in Sonora regarding UFO/strange activity (several things seen in past year).;37.9998;-120.3267

I was travelling east approaching The Junction shopping centre and the light came down around Phoenix Lake Area, not far from Lyons Bald Mountain. It was an emerald green colour, not too bright and very different from anything I have seen before. Acted in a controlled way, stopping before hitting the fround on the horizon. I was travelling to work so couldn't stop and look further. I turned off the raod and went away from the area it came down.;37.9998;-120.3267
Very bright orange light low in sky, then just blinked out from left to right.;2007-08-06 20:30:00;10 mins;Very bright orange light low in sky, then just blinked out from left to right. I was swimming at Angels Creek, New Melones Lake when I saw a very bright, orange light -  low in sky. Stayed stationary for 10 mins. Noticed many aircraft in vacinity to compare it to. Was about twice the intensity of Venus. As I was watching it it just blinked out and was gone. As it dissapeared it gave the impression that it dissapeared from left to right, as if someone had rubbed out the left side before the right side. Anyhows, it was gone in less than a second.;37.9998;-120.3267

He claims he was laying in bed with his curtains open and his eyes closed when he saw a bright light through his eye lids. He opened them up and looked out and saw a bright ball of light that zig-zagged up and away.  Right when the ball was moving up and away, the house started shaking.  This apparently was seen and heard throughout the entire county.;37.9998;-120.3267
