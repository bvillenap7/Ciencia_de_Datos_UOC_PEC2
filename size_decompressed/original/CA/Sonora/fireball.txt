Large, low object shot across night sky.;2006-07-19 20:30:00;2 secs;Large, low object shot across night sky. After we had gone swimming in the New Melones lake  I witnessed a large, bright object shoot acroos the sky at high speed. It was made up of a large fireball type light and several smaller lights and left a trail for a second or so. I would guess by the detail that I could observe that it wasn't flying at too high an altitude. It travelled parallel with the ground and took approx. 2 seconds to travel from where I observed it to out of sight.;37.9998;-120.3267
