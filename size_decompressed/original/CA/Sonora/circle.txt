Large Bluish-white Light Flies Slowly Northward over Sonora, CA;2004-04-03 19:15:00;3 minutes;Large Bluish-white Light Flies Slowly Northward over Sonora, CA I was facing east.  The full moon was up and to my right.  From my left (south) a large bluish white light flew over me, no more than a football field or two above.  It flew across the moon and kept going rather sedately.  It seemed to sway to its left and then to its right as it moved to the north.  Object was in sight for over three minutes.  Other aircraft (definitely planes with FAA mandated blinking lights) could be seen to the east of the object.  They were flying much higher than the object.  It gave me goose pimples and a feeling of excitement while I watched it.  It was beautiful!  There was no sound from the object, but it seemed to be hazy.;37.9998;-120.3267
