Two Silver Disc-Shaped Objects Hovered for 10 Minutes over Sonora, CA;2004-05-17 16:30:00;10 Minutes;Two Silver Disc-Shaped Objects Hovered for 10 Minutes over Sonora, CA I was on my back porch which faces ENE.  I looked up and saw two silver disck shaped objects hovering directly over my head.  The sun was behind my apartment and the silver discs were reflecting the sunlight.  I grabbed my video camcorder and recorded one of the disks hovering over me for about 10 minutes.  The other disc had disappeared.  Two hawks flew under and to the right of the object as it hovered.  Then, while I watched throught the camcorder's viewfinder, the object seemed to fade in and out before it simply disappeared!  One second it was there, faded, came back again, then disappeared the next second.;37.9998;-120.3267
Low Flying Glowing Object Videotaped over Sonora, CA;2004-09-10 20:30:00;3 to 4 minutes;Low Flying Glowing Object Videotaped over Sonora, CA Between 20:00 and 21:15, fifteen glowing disc- or orb-like objects were seen heading in various directions either together, or one behind the other, or crossing each other's path.  One glowing object in particular flew no more than 200 yards overhead, heading to the Northeast.  Object was huge, bright yellow or silver-white in color, and moved very slowly at first as it was directly overhead, then accelerated at incredible speed and rapidly disappeared over the treeline to the Northeast.  This object was videotaped by both witnesses, one with a Sony Hi-8 Camcorder on a tripod, the other with a hand-held Sony Digital Camcorder. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from same witness.  PD));37.9998;-120.3267
UFO with (humourous) psychic component;2006-06-06 01:00:00;2 secs;UFO with (humourous) psychic component At 01.00 on May 31st 2006 I went to my porch to let my dogs out to go to toilet.  Neither would go out, which is very unusual. Just before heading to bed I heard an immense crackle very close outside like a static charge. (The windows were open). I went to bed without investigating... which seeems kind of odd, but maybe I was just frightened. I awoke in the morning to find one of the dogs had gone to toilet in the porch (rather than go out the night before).  The next night (0100 on 06/06/06) at around the same time again, I went to the porch to let the dogs out and again, neither would go out. I stood on the porch and looked at the sky and broke wind. Immediately I thought 'oh... i don't want to frighten them' and immediately, before I could even process this strange thought, saw a craft fly from above me to the North. It was in view for about a second... it wasn't going super-fast..... i saw enough of it to be able to recall it. It had several lights on it and was about the size of the moon in the sky.... maybe not so high up?  What's odd about this comical tale is that I appeared to know something was there before I saw it... I have absolutely no idea why I would have that thought enter my head after breaking wind!  Maybe nothing to do with this but Sonora has a lot of static electricity.... I am always getting shocked when I go shopping off of metal or material. Also, the cell phone reception here is very staticy... our TV reception is always getting lost. Sometimes it's good, others it's completely dead. We had 3 different engineers visit and they can't see anything wrong with it.  I have been as honest as possible in recalling events (as can be seen by the reference to breaking wind!);37.9998;-120.3267
