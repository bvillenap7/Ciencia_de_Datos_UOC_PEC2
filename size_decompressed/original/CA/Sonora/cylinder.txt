Cylindrical UFO Videotaped over Sonora, CA;2004-06-10 16:36:00;4 to 5 minutes;Cylindrical UFO Videotaped over Sonora, CA Facing east, saw what I thought was a plane, until I noticed it was barely moving.  What movement I could see, the silver-white cylinder shaped object was moving east.  Rather large, it had squared ends, not rounded.  It was hanging with its ends up and down and there was a line about two-thirds of the way down.  It looked like an exclamation point.  Object was videotaped for about 4 minutes or so, when it suddenly disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three photos of anomalous objects, taken by same witness.  We do not know what the cylindrical object is, but it appears to have two distinct parts to it.  We are unable to confirm what the object is, or what it could be.  PD));37.9998;-120.3267
