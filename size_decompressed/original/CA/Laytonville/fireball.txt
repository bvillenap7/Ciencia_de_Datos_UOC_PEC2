Northern California: Bright orange light veers through sky then vanishes.;2014-03-04 20:45:00;2 minutes;Northern California: Bright orange light veers through sky then vanishes. Tonight is March 4, 2014.   Around 20:45, I was outside locking up the animals for the night.  My home is not located in town, so no street lights.  It's very dark.   I notice strange lights, for my protection.  So when I spotted a glow from the corner of my eye, I walked to a clearing to get a better visual.   It was a fireball or bright light extremely high in the sky.  I'm familiar with air traffic here and this was not normal.  It was a bright or glowing deep orange-red crossing the sky.   My mother was inside the house.  I yelled for her to fone quick.   We stood watching for about 45 more seconds until the light disappeared, as if slipped through a trap door.;39.6631;-123.4981
