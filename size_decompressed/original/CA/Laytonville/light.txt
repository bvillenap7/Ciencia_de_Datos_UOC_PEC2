This evening in the western sky, my husband and I saw a cluster of connected lights flashing red, orange, green and white.  The lights hovered in one spot then moved left to right, up and down. It bounced all around the area.  Then it disappeared from sight.   At first we thought it might be a star and due to atmospheric conditions it might just appear to be moving.  After watching it hover and behave so erratically and the flashing lights, we felt that no star could do this.;39.6631;-123.4981
Random lights appearing from one point to another, sometimes at very fast speed and sometimes slightly changing direction.;2019-09-20 15:00:00;1-3 seconds;I'm not sure about the nature of this event but I found it quite unusual. I've got drone footage from Mendocino area, September 2019 and just had the chance to watch the footage. I can see random lights appearing from one point to another, sometimes at very fast speed and sometimes slightly changing direction. This has occurred several times (at least 8) and in different camera drone direction. I would like to know if you could be interested in watching the footage, perhaps through a screen sharing.;39.6631;-123.4981
