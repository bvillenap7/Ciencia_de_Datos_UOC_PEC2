Both noticed silver/blue star off in distance, that got closer very fast.  Object went behind some trees and when appeared again was very close. Moved over them about 200 ft above ground and 100 ft off to side. Was about 200 ft long, cigar shaped and about 25-40 in heighth. Object began to turn reddish in center and then complete object became reddish, with a glow that lit the area around it for perhaps a half mile or so, and had an exray effect. Subjects could see trees through the leaves of trees in the area. Object remained over them for about 10 mins or so, and then moved slowly away, at same heighth above ground and giving off reddish x-ray effect. Object then slowly rose into the sky and dissapeared. Same as above. Related to me from subject. Never told anybody about it. Figured peope would think they were crazy. Name of Subject who observed object available for interview if neccessary. I told him of the Art Bell Radio Talk Show and the UFO reporting center and he then volunteered the3 avove. Subject has no access to a computer and does not listen to talk radio.;39.3385;-120.1729
