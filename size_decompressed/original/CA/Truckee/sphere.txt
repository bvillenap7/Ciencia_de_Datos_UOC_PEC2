Round very light blue object goes behind a small mountain;2003-10-11 03:00:00;2-3 secs;Round very light blue object goes behind a small mountain Myself and my girlfriend are both professional people.  I work as tech support for an ISP and my girlfriend works for the electric company.  We were going east on I-80 from Sacramento, CA to Reno, NV.  It was about 3:00am when we were about a mile or less from Truckee.  In the sky to the left (from my position, it would be at the top left edge of the windshield) we both saw a light blue almost white perfectly spherical object with a darker blue horizontal line across the center.  It also appeared that there was an aura of the same darker blue around the object.  From our vantage point in the car, the object appeared about the size of a normal full moon.  It slowly travelled in a straight diagonal line to the left, then went in a slight arc downward behind a small mountain just off the highway.  By the time we reached a point on the highway where we could see where the object would have been there was nothing there;39.3385;-120.1729
