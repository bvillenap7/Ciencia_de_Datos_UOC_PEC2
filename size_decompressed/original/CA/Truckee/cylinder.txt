I am a truck driver.  I was on my way into california and I had just gone through the weigh and agriculture Check station a few minutes before i came around a bin on i-80 when I noticed what seem to be a cylindrical object just over the tree line.  it had three lights on it that where dim.  but they where brighter than any star and it was definitely in our atmosphere.  I almost stoped my truck to see it longer but the sight and location of it scared me l seemed to be the only one on the road that morning.  I kept going so I only Saw it for 45 seconds to a minute.  It made no movement.  It just hovered over the tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  This report originally was posted with a flawed date.  We have corrected the date above, and re-post the report.
