Several variouse lights of different color and irratic  movement.;2005-05-12 23:00:00;30 minutues;Several variouse lights of different color and irratic  movement. Several lights mimicing planes, stars, planets.  Irratic movement patterns and changing colors periodically.  One pulsed a slow orb of white/blue light only once.  Another, while moving, left a light behind it resembling a small distant star.   The more we talked about them and called other peoples attention to them the fewer remained, until they were gone.   A friend from across town called me simultaneously to report them.  A physcic link seemed provalent for myself, like they would respond to a communication of sorts.  Moving and reacting to catch my attention, perhaps displaying a playful attitude.  I can only conclude that there was no danger or pressence of evil involved.  Some of the lights may have even been spiritual entities for all I know.;39.3385;-120.1729
