Quick flying v shaped object, red and white lights outside Truckee/Tahoe CA;2002-10-20 19:15:00;25 seconds;Quick flying v shaped object, red and white lights outside Truckee/Tahoe CA I was driving on Hwy 80 from Reno to San Francisco in the Sierra Nevada Mountains when I saw this very fast and low flying V shaped object in the air. It was nearly dark and it had a row of red lights along the V shape on top and a series of pulsating white lights on the side and bottom. The strangest thing was how fast it moved up and down and forward and backward. No plane or helicopter could have moved that fast.;39.3385;-120.1729
