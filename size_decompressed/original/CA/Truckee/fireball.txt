Sighted object(s) of two red-orange glowing balls with comet-like glowing tails. ((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.  PD));2016-07-27 21:40:00;15 seconds;Sighted object(s) of two red-orange glowing balls with comet-like glowing tails travel at low altitude above freeway Observed for second time within month of July including today, July 27, 2016, about 9:40pm. Objects appeared to be fixed together about 50ft apart. Two red-orange glowing balls of light with a cloud-like glow trailing behind each 'unit' and making them appear like comet trails about 1-1/2 times in length longer than the width of the units or glowing balls. At first appearance it seemed like perhaps two closely piloted helicopters carrying glowing balls rigid to their bodies and the glow lingering in a trailing cloud or mist behind them. There was no sound from the object or possible paired objects. It flew from west to east overhead maybe two hundred feet above Interstate 80 going past Donner Lake in Truckee, toward Reno. It traveled about the same speed as freeway traffic below in a straight path coincident with the freeway. The appearance of the two glowing balls of light with glowing tails, the lack of any audible noise, the steady and straight navigation, and with no experiences in my life of seeing such object(s) in night sky in my lifetime, and the seeing such an event twice in the same month, all provoked me to research the Internet for any such similar sightings tonight or in the past. I found this site and read the report for California UFO sightings and found some were similar to mine, so in the interest of contributing to this data am filing this report for the record.
