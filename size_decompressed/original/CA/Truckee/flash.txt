I am a retired RF Engineer living here in Truckee California where the skies are clear and dark at night.  I occasionally watch the eastern sky hoping to see something interesting.  I got my wish, at 10PM on Thursday, June 21st, looking easterly in the heavens where satellites pass by I looked closely for movement and was about to give up when I saw a brilliant bright flash and from that flash emerged a lightly glowing orange object which began moving across the horizon to the north at an incredibly fast speed, gone and out of sight in about 90 seconds.  Never have I witnessed anything that unusual in the skies before. The following night while asleep I was awoken from a dream where I was outside watching the skies when a small UFO no bigger than a motorcycle zoomed up next to me and in my head I knew I was not to tell anyone about what I saw that night.;39.3385;-120.1729
