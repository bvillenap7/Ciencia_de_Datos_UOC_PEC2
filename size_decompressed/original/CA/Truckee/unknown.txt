While watching the stars I saw an object traveling from South to North at a high allitude. It was traveling across the sky when it turned a bright white color and stopped. A smaller light appeared to come from it and moved across the sky on a different path. I went inside to get a telescope to look at the now stationary object but when I returned it was gone.;39.3385;-120.1729
