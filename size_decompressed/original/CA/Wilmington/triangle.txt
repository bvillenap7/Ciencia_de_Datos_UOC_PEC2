I positioned myself to get a better view and it wasn’t a street light, it wasn’t anything like I had seen before, like it was on fire and brighter than the sun!  I went into the garage and told my friend Craig to come check it out.  At first, he couldn’t see it, but as soon as he did he said,  What ((words deleted)) is that and as soon as he said that the object turned bright white and was gone faster than a blinking eye.  It was like poof vanished in to thin air. We stood in the patio for about the next hour just watching if anything would reappear, but noting.  The distance we were at from the object was probably 20 miles and it was about .75” wide evenly, it would fit behind your thumb at arm’s length. No noise, no atmospheric change, no obvious differences. I did find out that exactly when we spotted it at 11:39, a 2.5 mag Earthquake occurred in coastal OR.  Unbelievably bizarre, I don’t have any explanation for what we saw…;33.781;-118.262199999999
