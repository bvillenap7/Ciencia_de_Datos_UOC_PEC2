It looked like it was flicking and dropping small fire balls that would disappear I cant remember the exact date but its between June of 2000 and August 2001. I wanted to report the incidents before but didnt know who or where to report it to until I came across your website.  I was going through the archives and I noticed other reports of similar sightings around the time I experienced my sightings.   On three different occasions Me and a couple of friends were smoking a ciggarette outside around 3:15 am when we noticed a bright orange object in the sky.  At first we thought it was a flare but it couldnt be, because the object was not coming down.  We observed what I can describe as a fireball floating very slowly and decending from East to NorthWest for about 15 minutes until the object floated behind the houselines.  That was approximately 2.5 to 3 miles from where we were at.  On the second occasion around the same time and location in Wilmington about 3 months later.  Me and one of the other witnesses from the first sighting were outside and noticed 2 Similar objects coming from the same direction.  It was very similar to the first sighting but now there were 2 objects.  On the third occasion about 6 mos later, around 4 am.I saw a fireball in the sky coming from the east.  It was floating and dropping smaller fireballs as it dissapeared  then it would flicker and then it got bigger and at 1 point it got so small that it dissapeared and then it would reappear, It did that a couple of times then it dissapeared completely.  The 3 sightings happened on a weekend.;33.781;-118.262199999999
