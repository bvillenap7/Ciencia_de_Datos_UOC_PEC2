Patterned disks over southern california sky.;1991-10-01 17:00:00;15 minutes;Patterned disks over southern california sky. Observed one silver circular object in the sky above us.  The single disk separated into two equal sized disks, same size as the original.  All of this happening while moving north-west in a slow but constant speed.  The second circular disk was following the first closely in a straight line.  After passing some clouds, observed two smaller disks on the front left and front right of the first disk.  Still moving in a straight line heading north-west, again observed two smaller disks emerging from the second trailing circular object.  The two new smaller objects then moved to the back left and back right of the second trailing circular disk.  The position of the disks were like a convoy with the two large circular disks in the center and four smaller disks on the front and back.  The objects continued on their straight line flight towards north-northwest.  Until the objects could no longer be seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Ball of orange/white gaseous light seen over Los Angeles suberb for 10 minutes.;2004-03-27 22:30:00;10 minutes;Ball of orange/white gaseous light seen over Los Angeles suberb for 10 minutes. I saw a bright orange/white object in the northern sky over Carson, California, a southern suberb of Los Angeles. Time was 10:30 pm Saturday night March 23'rd, 2004. I was in my back yard. I turned off my porch light, went into my house, noted the time and got my binaculors. I then spent the next 10 minutes observing this object. It moved from the north to the west. It was approx. the size of Venus after sunset. It appeared to be like a bright ball of glowing, gaseous fire/plasma. At the end of the 10 minutes a small piece of it came off, fell and disapeared. Before the larger object disapeared it appeared to be going around in a circle and making figure eights, like when you play with a lazer pointer on a surface. I am 52 years old. I have lived in the same residence for the last 47 years. I am a high school graduate with some higher education. I have never seen a ufo until last year, when I had 3 sightings similar to this one over 4 nights in late summer 2003. As a matter of fact the last sighting occured at exactly the same time (10:30 pm) and started in the same location of the sky, in the north, just south of Los Angeles. I live near 3 airports (LAX, Long Beach & Torrance). I am familar with aircraft at night, this was not an aircraft of any kind. What it was, I don't know.

orange glowing object over Carson,CA;2005-08-05 01:05:00;9 minutes;orange glowing object over Carson,CA Awoke from sleep approximately midnight, noted the time, closed my eyes and awoke an hour later at 1 AM.  Went outside in my back yard and 15 seconds later I saw an orange glowing ball shaped light appear due east over Carson,CA. It arose in the night sky, headed south toward the direction of my house.  I got my glasses and binoculars from inside my house to get a better look. Aside from a closer view, I could not observe any more detail. It was a glowing and disfused orange light in my binoculars.  At one point it flashed/pulsed a white light for a few seconds.  It stayed stationary for a while and then dripped small parts of orange material, dimmed and disapeared.  Having had multiple sightings, I believe the mathamatical odds that the random times I observe the night sky and see these objects, is well beyond the realm of chance.  For it to be flares, they would have to be constantly launched to coincide with my viewings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
