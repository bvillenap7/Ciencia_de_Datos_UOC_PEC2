faintly red/white glowing object seen over Wilmington,CA;2005-07-22 21:10:00;7 minutes;faintly red/white glowing object seen over Wilmington,CA In the middle of the night sky a faintly luminescent red/whitish (mostly red) object was seen in the clear night sky. It was an irregular cigar type shape, that is the shape went one direction, then another, but kept the cigar type shape. It moved at a slow speed, slightly turning end over end very slowly at times. After spotting the object with my naked eye I went into the house to get my binoculars to observe it. It moved to the northwest then turned toward the east while still staying in the general middle part of the sky. I observed it go directly east until it disapeared in the distance. At one point a commercial aircraft went under my view as the object went east. The entire elapsed time was 7 minutes. I have never observed an object like this before. It seemed to have an internal glow, unlike a firery or reflective light. A very clear warm night with no wind. Very slowly turning end over end at some points was a major characteristic I have never observed before. The object appeared large and I can only guess it's altitude as being higher than planes fly. The object seemed to be under some control, and not an object drifting or floating. It was silent.;33.781;-118.262199999999
