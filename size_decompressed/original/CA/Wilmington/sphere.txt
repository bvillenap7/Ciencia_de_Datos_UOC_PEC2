3 spheres above the Los Angeles Harbor;2009-04-05 17:00:00;10 minutes;3 spheres above the Los Angeles Harbor My daughter saw what she thought was a mylar balloon just hovering high above the sky.  When I looked up, I saw 3 spheres just hovering in the sky.  I am going to guess at least 20K feet above the ground.  The spheres where in a triangle form.  After about 10 minutes the all moved to the north.  A few minutes later, one shot to the south at supersonic speeds.;33.781;-118.262199999999
