I saw three lights come together and then split apart continously for 30 min. over S Los Angeles.  ((NUFORC Note:  Ad' lights??  PD));2000-01-20 18:00:00;1/2 hour;((NUFORC Note:  We receive many reports somewhat similar to this one.  We assume that many of such reports describe advertising lights.)) I saw three lights come together and then split apart continously for half an hour over southern Los Angeles, California.  They were moving at an extreme speed. They were under light clouds. At 18.00 (6pm pacific standard time),I went out into my back yard to check out the weather and the upcoming lunar eclipse.  I went to the back of my yard which is west.   I then noticed in the southwest sky over Wilmington,Harbor City, Lomita, San Pedro, Torrance, CALIFORNIA (which is the southern portion of Los Angeles, California), 3 lights going around in circles, coming together, and then splitting apart.   This went on till 18:30 (6:30 pacific standard time) when they met and then ceased.   During the later part of the half hour they moved to the center portion of the southern sky in widening colescing circles.  Then before they stopped they moved back to the southwest, for the last five minutes or so. They moved at extreme speeds in the sky.  As quick as you could wave your hands in the sky. Their relative size was a little smaller than the full moon. The three lights seemed to difuse a bit as they reached the outside of their circle before coming together in the middle when they crossed paths again and again. After a half hour of my viewing this they came together and ceased. They seemed like 3 transparent lights,shaped somewhat like manta rays. There was a light cloud cover while this was happening and the objects stayed under this even though the western sky toward the beach was clear with no clouds.  I would be interested if other people reported this sighting and would like to be informed if this occurs. If you phone me,leave a message and I will then call you back collect.  Thank you.

Orange ball of light over Carson, CA.;2005-07-09 23:11:00;6 minutes;Orange ball of light over Carson, CA. An orange ball of light sighted as I was loading my vechicle with merchandise for a flea market the next day. I glanced up into the night sky and saw a orange light. I went into the house to get my binoculars and checked the time as 11:11 PM. I went back outside and observed the object for 6 minutes until it disapeared. The ground wind was slight to the west as I observed my neighbors flag flying. The object stayed at approx. the same altitude, but drifed very slowly to the east, until it disapeared. It was halfway from the horizon and had the basic relative size as the average bright star or planet that night. It was brighter than anything else, and orange colored.  I had a similar sighting approx. 2 months ago at 3:45 AM, on the second Saturday of the month. I was also loading my car at the time.  I also have observed these objects over approx. the same location before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));33.781;-118.262199999999

Two times this month, between 10pm and 12am, we have seen blue shooting stars moving north to south one night, and west to east a week later.  These shooting starsare completely stopping mid air then quickly shooting again to another dead stop and so on until out of sight.  We watched these blue stars stop 6-7 times in a span of one minute, until out of sight.  Very high altitude and absolutely silent with an amazing blue light.  We see satellites, jets, planes etc. and these are none of those. Has anyone seen these before?  Please help with other witness reports of similar as my crew and i can not stop talking and wondering about what it is we are witnessing.

UFOs over UFO Wilmington, CA, Giant cloud z cloud stair case cloud. ((anonymous report))((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2017-12-22 17:38:00;3 minutes;UFOs over UFO wilmington, CA 90744 Giant cloud z cloud stair case cloud december 22, 2017 12/22/2017 My mom bursts in the door and talks about gigantic stars. I first think, She must be talking about Venus or Mars.  I go outside and two massive looking comets are streaking gradually away from a gigantic cloud formation. I can understand comets but their trail was astounding. It was a square Z shape cloud or a stair-case kind of bend with an enormous cloud formation that glowed in the moonlight.  Their cloud trail ended abruptly and no longer left any kind of cloud. One of the objects appear to gradually lose radiance and appear to make gradual decline in altitude until it disappeared.  The other took off west over the ocean with no apparent drop in altitude but a loss of brightness. My neighbor was outside and watching longer than we were.  However, he only noticed that they moved away from the cloud.  The cloud quickly dissipated over the next few minutes adding that it was just recently made.  There are other clouds in the sky and none were reacting the same way. We later waited.  The sky cleared as if nothing happened.;33.781;-118.262199999999
