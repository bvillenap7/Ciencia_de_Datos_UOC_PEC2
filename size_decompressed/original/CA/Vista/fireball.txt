Red/Gold streaking light w/ sparking trail flies North to South in straight line over Vista, Ca. (Shadowridge);2005-05-13 00:30:00;7-8 seconds;Red/Gold streaking light w/ sparking trail flies North to South in straight line over Vista, Ca. (Shadowridge) My roommate and I left our apartment and went out to our car when I noticed movement in the sky almost directly above and in front of us as we walked East through the parking lot.  When I looked up, I expected to see the lights of a plane coming in to land at Palomar airport, turning on it's landing lights and making it's banked turn West.  Instead, I spotted a very bright red/gold light with a long streaking tail. The second I saw that, I reacted by jabbing my friend's shoulder to get his attention. I pointed up to it. It reached directly overhead when he spotted it.  It continued streaking across the sky, running North to South, and the tail even started to spark. Then it faded and went out of sight to the South. We both believe that this was a meteorite or a piece of space debris falling back to Earth. It appeared very low, lasted much longer than I've ever seen, and was really bright. If it was just a meteorite, it was a fairly bright one and still a spectacular sight for anyone who may have caught this one. I wouldn't be surprised if one or two more local reports come in on this tonight.;33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973
Slow moving slow pulsating fireball that stopped in sky then dropped sparks and starting falling with sparks;2011-09-22 22:25:00;3 minutes;Slow moving slow pulsating fireball that stopped in sky then dropped sparks and starting falling with sparks Observed red fire ball travelling from NW to SE From the Pacific Ocean.  I thought this was an airplane since the red orb was pulsing to a bright red color which made it appear twice as big.  The speed of this object was traveling slowly and the pulse was about every 1.5 seconds. I had time to call my daughter outside to see this red orb.  When the Orb stopped in the sky at about 1800 feet I called my wife to come see the object.  My wife came out about 30 seconds later and the orb was still there.  My wife saw the orb pulsing in the same spot for 10-15 seconds .  The orb then started to drop what looked like hot embers or sparks.  With sparks falling the orb started falling and fading slowly until we could not see it anymore.   The event has left me a bit confused.  Can someone tell  me what this was. Thanks;33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973
