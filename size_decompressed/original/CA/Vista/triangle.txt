I would say 2-3 times larger at least. the 2nd craft was a triangle/ tear drop and consisted of three blue dots in a tight narrow triangle with a long blue tail. they were a few seconds apart and moving from the north to the south/east at very high rate of speed. the total time from when we first saw them to when they were out of sight was no more than 10 seconds;33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973
three triangle Shaped craft recon behind a hill in vista,ca at night.;2004-03-14 19:00:00;10 min;three triangle Shaped craft recon behind a hill in vista,ca at night. I Am a begining astronomer. I was outside using my new telescope i got. I live up in the hills i can see the ocean from my house. it was a clear night and as i was looking at the stars light caught my eye. it was triangle shaped with redish blue glowing lights on each tip. I live in the midsection of a hill. it hovered above the hill and went behind the otherside of the hill for a while and then came back up. it was moving as a helicopeter would but move like a hovercraft. after it came up 2 other craft apeared in the sky identical to the first. they both went behind the hill slowly. about a minute later what looked to be 2 military jets(no joke sounded like a jet atleast) began to head toward the my house and hill. seconds later 3 beams of light flashed up into the sky and disapeared. These were not human aircraft. i still wonder about the military jets still. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973
MY FRIEND AND I WERE FISHING IN THE COVE BY OCEANSIDE,CA AND NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT. WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A COBRA OR A MILITARY AIRCR;2007-09-21 22:00:00;6-7 MIN;MY FRIEND AND I WERE FISHING IN THE COVE BY OCEANSIDE,CA AND NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT. WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A COBRA OR A MILITARY AIRCRAFT DOING MANUEVERS IN THE AREA. The craft hovered over us for at least 3-5 minutes before shoooting off towards the west and disapeering into the fog bank. The speed in which it left the area was far beyond anything my friend and I have ever experienced . I have never witnessed anything like this in my life. The light seemed of an aura of some kind surrounding the craft.Colors: RED,PINK, MOSTLY WHITE ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

I saw what looked similar to a airplane gliding from north to south.  It was very hard to make out as it seemed translucent and made no sound as it faded into the night sky.  I thought maybe 3 large birds flying in formation as there was some lighter coloring at the center and on the outer tips.  But looked more like a triangle glider with no lights and cloaking ability.  To be honest it left me with an uneasy feeling.  I scanned the city lit sky for the object but it never came into view again. Also note that there was a high presence of military air traffic.;33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973
