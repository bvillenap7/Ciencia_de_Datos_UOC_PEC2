Zig sagged light in sky;2011-01-07 07:30:00;4 min;Zig sagged light in sky It was dusk and we were standing in the back yard talking.  We saw a light going across the sky.  I thought it was a satellite.  It seemed to be going faster than one.  It was traveling south to north.  It was going in a straight line it zip sagged three times.   We looked at each other and said, what was that.  It must have been a UFO.  We didn't get any pictures or video.;33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973
