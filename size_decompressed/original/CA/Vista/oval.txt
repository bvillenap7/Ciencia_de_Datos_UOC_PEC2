I saw unidentified lights in the night sky.;2013-10-17 23:00:00;20 minutes;I saw unidentified lights in the night sky. Location: northern San Diego county, California, USA. Time: about midnight, Thursday (Oct. 17th, 2013). For about 20 minutes, I saw some lights high up in the dark sky.  The moon was in the West, these lights were in the East.  The lights were not part of any constellation. The lights formed a horizontal oval - the shape reminded me of an eye-socket.  There were about 12-16 or so separate white lights (I apologize for not counting them), all about as bright as Sirius or Venus normally are.   As far as I could tell, the lights remained stationary in the sky (part of the time, I was driving on freeways, so my perspective changed a bit)   My camera wouldn't take a picture - too dark. It was cold and the lights weren't doing anything, so I went inside and to bed.;33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973
