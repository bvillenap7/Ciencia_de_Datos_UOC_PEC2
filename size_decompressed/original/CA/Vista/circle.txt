Hovering ball in my backyard.;2014-12-17 02:00:00;3 minutes;Hovering ball in my backyard. My room is built in the backyard, so I had to get up to use the bathroom.  As I was about to enter my house through the backyard door, I noticed a ball lit about 30 feet high in my neighbor's backyard, it was hovering there for awhile until it started to move towards my front yard.  I woke my brother up to come see it, by the time he got downstairs and into the front yard, it was far away and he said it was a helicopter.  It was no longer as visible when i first saw it.  When i first saw it, it was like flashing a bit, like if a huge lighter was in the sky.  It faded away once i called my brother to the front yard.;33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973
