It was bright, neon green with a bright orange, firey trail running behind it. We saw a disk from the side so it appeared like a cigar but we are sure it was a disk. It was bright, neon green with a bright orange, firey trail running behind it. It had brighter lights along the sides. It was flying in an arc as if it was about to crash but we did not hear a crash or see any explosion. It was not falling but was flying under power. I could not determine whether the flames were normal or were a sign of distress. We only observed it for 3 seconds and it did not change direction during that time. It only continued in a downward arc and went behind the trees where we couldn't see it. When we saw it, we were traveling along Sunset Drive in a northern direction. It was directly ahead of us, not high in the sky and arcing down as it went. After it went behind the trees, we continued to scan the sky for about 7 minutes as we drove but we didn't see anything else.;33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973
