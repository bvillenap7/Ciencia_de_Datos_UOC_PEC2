Strange orb over Vista California;2004-10-23 12:45:00;10 min;Strange orb over Vista California I was standing outside of an AAmoco shop waiting for my car to be repaired. It was clear outside and the sun was bright with clear skies and unlimited visibility. I was observing a hwak in the sky when I noticed a bright metallic (orb) or possibly a cylinder. At first I thought it was possibly a mylar balloon(the type you get for a childs birthday) but I noticed a light aircraft below the orb, way below the orb! I called the manager over to observe it and he was also astounded by it. It was stationary from when I first  observed it until it started moving(drifting?) slowly from east to west. The stationary position lasted about 2 minutes. We observed several commercial jet aircraft on flight paths directly below it also. I can easily say the the orb was about 10,000 to 20,000 feet up. It drifted then for approx. 10 more minutes and stopped for about 30 seconds and vanished from my sight. What is very strange is that it just disappeared. It didn't shoot up furtherinto the distance or zoom off, it just disappeared. Vista is south of Camp Pendelton Marine base. I would say that it was over the southern area of the base or near the boundary. I also wonder if it was some sort of observation platform they are experimenting with. Strange the way it behaved.;33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973
