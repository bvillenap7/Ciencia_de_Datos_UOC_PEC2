A curved hovering object with bright halogen shaped lights seen in Vista;2007-12-29 07:00:00;8 minutes;A curved hovering object with bright halogen shaped lights seen in Vista After shopping at Micheals craft store after work I started on my way home. I makd a left on sycamore and made another left onto South Santa Fe Avenue heading North.  Right  after I passed the new Sprinter crossing I noticed lights floating in the sky  slightly to the left of the way the road runs.  There are houses on that side where it was floating, and lots of trees.  I slowed down to about 5 to 8 miles an hour. There are no cars around me.  I turn my stereo off.  I stare at the lights. They look exactly like the halogen lights people use as security lights above their driveway.  There are 3 of them.  They are very bright.  There were  no flashing lights like on a plane, and a plane would not be that close to the houses like this thing was.  It was hovering really slowly.  It reminded me of a donut the way it was curved around.  The lights were in a line, they were the same size and shape.  They were the same brightness.  There was an actual airplane off in the distance so I could see the difference between the 2.  This floating mass of lights was no plane.  It was no helicopter.  I rolled my window down and I didnâ€™t hear any sounds like a plane or a helicopter would make.  I proceeded north and made a right onto Cypress drive.  The lights seemed to float away over the hill and towards Shadowridge. I raced home to get my husband and made him drive with me out to where I saw this lighted floating object, but we could see nothing.  I am absolutely sure I saw something and whatever it was that I did see was not normal.;33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973

Very bright light floats over San Marcos Ca.;2014-03-07 05:30:00;1/2 hour;Very bright light floats over San Marcos Ca. I live in Vista Ca, I went out to the back porch at 5:30 am and seen a very bright lite.  I figured it was a plane coming in for a landing at palomar airport.   I stood their waiting for it to fly overhead.  15 min went by and I scene two planes flying in the same direction one on each side the planes passed this object up and flew out of site.   I thought it could of been a blimp I heard no motor noise and this floating bright light moved at a snails pace because now I'm standing watching and waiting for it to get closer and it's now 6am.   I was cold and went in the house and never heard it fly overhead..;33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973
Several bright colored orange balls of light floating north, about 1/4 mile high.  No noise or trails.;2014-12-25 00:30:00;~3 minutes;Several bright colored orange balls of light floating north, about 1/4 mile high.  No noise or trails. My wife and I and our 3 boys were driving home from Christmas eve at my parents' house. When we crested a small hill in the road, heading south on east vista way, we all saw several orange colored balls of light floating or drifting along heading north over East Vista Way and Mason Street.  There were about 10 to 12 of these balls, just slowly floating north toward us.  I asked my wife to pull over so I could film the event, but she would not stop do to our scared and frighten kids.  She finally pulled over at the corner of Warmlands and East Vista Way, and I junped out just to see the turning off or disappearing.   One other guy pulled over and asked me if we saw the lights.  He was very excited as I was. I told him I did not know what they were.  He jumped in his car and left, and we did the same, since the light were gone.;33.1920836734694;-117.240129931973
