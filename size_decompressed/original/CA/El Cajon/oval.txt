I initially saw two objects one that was Large and Blue/Purple and one that was Orange.  After a period of time I saw another orange glowing orb.   These objects initially looked like they were lowered down from the sky on a string but then began to dip and fly all over the place at a very high rate of speed.   At the end of my viewing the Large Blue Object Flew very close to me.  I would estimate its size to be about 100FT Long.  The Blue Glowing Orb intensified its Glowing and began to rise to altitudes that made the object hard to see and then would drop straight down to maybe a mile or so above the earth.   The orb then lowered to just above the ground and two Military Helicopters showed up and the thing disappeared and the helicopters circled for maybe a half an hour after the thing left....  The three orbs seemed to almost touch frequently. This Video is exactly the same thing that i saw: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ6hdV81DaY;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
