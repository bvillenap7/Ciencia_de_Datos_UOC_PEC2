We watched them change formation, come together, spread apart and hover for about 45 minutes. Then, from the south 18 more dimmer lights in a long formation slowly moved in a northern direction, eventually coming together with the two brighter lights in a central cluster. They stayed in that cluster for about 15 minutes, occasionally forming 3 pointed triangles and flashing green and red alternating colors as they moved. As the sun dipped in the western sky they became gradually dimmer until we could no longer see them. ((NUFORC Note:  If anyone was witness to this event, we would welcome additional reports.

green light crashed into star;2001-07-05 21:00:00;about an hour;green light crashed into star We were coming home from somewhere, my family and me, and on the way down our street we pulled over to say hello to our neighbors, who were sitting outside in chairs looking up at the sky. We asked them what they were looking at and they said the green star up there. So we continued down the road until we reached our house. I got out of the car and watched it for a little while. The star moved slowly towards us at an extremely slow speed, almost unseeable. Then all of a sudden it shot back to a star at light speed. When it hit, the star lit up really bright for a split second, then returned to normal. No more than 10 minutes later we were over across the street in our other neighbor's driveway, talking to him. I looked up and saw a flock of black birds flying directly overhead. They made no sound, and it was pitch black out and so were the birds. It was a miracle that I saw them. It took me a long time to get everyone else to see them by pointing them out. What i've found is that ufo sightings are somewhat strangely linked with black birds somehow, I haven't figured it out yet, but I've heard other people's sightings, and some of them saw black birds too. I hope that was usefull to someone out there, and if not, oh well, it still has my attention and I know I saw what I saw, and I know that what I saw was real. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness remains totally anonymous.  We wonder if the green star may have been a twinkling star.  We do not know if blackbirds traditionally fly at night, and we have no suspicion that blackbirds, or their activities, are in any way related to the presence of UFO's.

Possible balloons and highway flares??;2004-07-04 21:00:00;45 min.;Possible balloons and highway flares?? We also witnessed the two flickering red lights hanging pretty much stationary above El Cajon, Ca. on the evening of the 4th Of July. I somewhat excitedly called my relatives out to look at them, and my brother said it appeared to him like it could possibly be two ordinary highway flares dangling on strings from a couple of small helium balloons. I watched them with binoculars, and the movement of the lights and the flickering and fading out one by one over the next 45 mins. or so do seem to support this theory. I think it's possible that someone in the San Diego area might be conducting this hoax repetively on major holidays ( see previous reports of New Year's Eve sightings);32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
July 4th fireworks display takes a back seat to piercing red lights in the San Diego sky...;2004-07-04 21:15:00;20-25 Minutes;July 4th fireworks display takes a back seat to piercing red lights in the San Diego sky... On July 4th just after 9:00 PM my family and I returned to our home from an outing. Since my brother and law and I had our children with us, we decided to stay outside to view a local fireworks display.  There were several neighbors doing the same in the vicinity.  After a few minutes of viewing I noticed one group of neighbors standing 10 feet away looking up in the opposite direction of the fireworks display.  I followed their line of sight and noticed two red points of light flickering in the sky.  What struck me at that moment is that these lights appeared to possess the same characteristics as the lights that I had seen on two previous occasions (single point, bright red, same intensity).  Both lights were located in roughly the same area as the single red light my family and I witnessed just after 12:00 AM New Years 2004 (I called several family members away from our party to witness that event) and a single red light I witnessed some time in the early morning hours of October 2003.  During the New Years sighting I watched a single red light slowly move from south to north and to nearly overhead where it then stopped and stayed stationary for 15-20 minutes.  The light subsequently disappeared.  During the October event I drove 3 miles west in an attempt to align myself directly under the light.  I did this in an effort to try to ascertain what exactly it was. I eventually positioned myself to what I perceived as being directly under it, but still could not make any real determination as to the type of aircraft I was observing.  It too then disappeared abruptly within 20-30 minutes of initial sighting.  July 4th's lights appeared stationary at about 75 degrees above the horizon west of our position. For the majority of the sighting there were two distinct lights approximately one fists distance from one another.  They appeared to remain equal distanced and didn't produce any sound.  Unlike the previous sightings these flickered. There were private aircraft in the area and on one occasion a small aircraft passed slightly east and under the lights as it continued on its the downwind leg for Gillespie (KSEE, small regional airport in the vicinity 2 miles north).  I would estimate the small aircraft was flying at 1000-1500 AGL.  These lights seemed much higher and both the small aircraft and unidentified lights were unaffected by one anotherâ€™s presence.  Some minutes later the north side light dimmed, flickered on and off in random pulses, almost like it was struggling to stay lit, then disappeared entirely.  The south side light continued to flicker for an additional 5 minutes and then it too disappeared.  The final light disappearance strangely coincided with the conclusion of the fireworks display.  It seems too much of a coincidence that two of my observations occurred on holidays and during what most would consider the peak period of the holiday.  I live in a densely populated, brightly lit suburb in east San Diego.  I have 2 small regional airports within 15 miles, and MCAS Miramar is 10 miles northwest.  I have been on the MCAS Miramar air base several times and the installation has never struck me as a special projects installation.  It seems to me that any sort new platform testing from Miramar would be unlikely considering the base's proximity to greater San Diego.  Perhaps some type of new surveillance device related to homeland security?  The lights had to be noticed by many this time.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135

The lights would blink on and off and also moving in same direction and suddenly wen I was among a number of people that witnessed two red lights blinking off and on in the eastern sky near San Diego.  They would move apart and then get close to each other, never merging into one.  They also moved towards our direction as if it was one craft.  They were probably 2500 to 3000 ft. high directly over us.  There were probably more than a thousand people on the side of this hill to view the 4th of July fireworks in the valley below.  This is the third time I have seen these lights in the past three years.  The other times were ironically both on New Years Eve.  These lights seem to hover and blink off and on and eventually blink out and disappear. If anyone has info on this, please send it in.  This was not an aircraft, helicopter or private plane.  It is strange.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Red Object West of San Diego, CA;2005-07-04 21:00:00;20-25 mins;Red Object West of San Diego, CA A bright red light appeared, as we looked west around the 11 o'clock position at a high altitude. The object remained motionless and changed from a small red dot to a very bright red light changing at different intervals. After approx 15 minutes the object seem to move westward very slowly until it just disappeared. The object was viewed without any magnifying devices, but seem to be round in shape and just the color red was seen.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Two bright objects travelling over San Diego headed north. High altitude, possibly outside atmosphere.;2006-08-17 21:06:00;1 minute;Two bright objects travelling over San Diego headed north. High altitude, possibly outside atmosphere. I was cleaning my pool tonite, and happened to look up and see two fast moving lights travelling from the south to the north very fast. After the first 5 seconds of focusing in on both lights, the second one disappeared. These looked to be outside of our atmosphere as the light looked to be reflected from the sun. If the second one vanished that fast, it must have dropped into the atmosphere very fast and out of the suns path. The one that stayed in my vision the longest, appeared to make a sudden corrective change but still heading north. The light was bright white. I thought it might be a satellite, however there were two of them and they were close together going in the same direction.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Orb of light changed directions rapidly in the sky;2007-09-25 05:38:00;10 Minutes;Orb of light changed directions rapidly in the sky This is the second time I have witnessed this type of activity early in the morning.  The first was at 4:45am with my fiancÃ©e and this was at 5:38 am. Alone.  I was walking my dogs and looked up into the sky because a bright orb caught my eye.  As I looked at it, it seemed to be about Â¾ of a mile to a mile away. It moved up and then down and then back and diagonally very quickly and then stopped abruptly to hover.  As it hovered it was swinging slightly from right to left, then it crossed the sky towards the east very slowly emitting a white light.  No plane or helicopter I know of moves that way. The bright white light was moving slower than the first one I encountered in February that moved very very quickly across the sky in al directions.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Four red lights travelling east out of San Diego south of El Cajon.;2009-07-04 20:35:00;16 minutes;Four red lights travelling east out of San Diego south of El Cajon. At 2035 7.4.09 I observed four red luminous single red lights moving in an easterly trajectory out of San Diego.  The four lights were well spaced apart, the second and third running an almost parallel course.  Although red,  they were luminous like Venus.  The moon was in the sky,  full and in the SE sky.  The four lights passed almost directly overhead,  never flickering.  The flightpath to nearby Gillespie Field received two incoming light planes in that time that the lights were observed.  The eastern flight path out of Lindberg Field San Diego is further south.  The lights appeared to gain a vertical altitude upon reaching a point south of the city of El Cajon.  The continued slowly tracking east,  maintaining the same luminosity.  Further to the east 4th of July fireworks began but were in the sky at a much lower altitude to the light. Observer1:  Former police officer,  accident investigator,  regularly transcontinental flight customer. Observor2:  government contractor,  complete basic flying course (unaccreddited)  Photographs taken in the evening sky,  difficult to record three of the lights without foreground.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135

They appeared in the western sky in a triangular shape and slowly moved across the sky to the east.  They did not rise from the horizon they just appeared in the sky.  Two of the lights seemed to stay side by side.  Two of the lights disappeared and the other two continued across the sky and we lost sight as the fireworks started.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Red light east of San Diego and west of Alpine looking south from Interstate 8;2009-07-04 21:10:00;15 minutes;Red light east of San Diego and west of Alpine looking south from Interstate 8 We are located 30 miles east of San Diego, along Interstate 8.  We observed a red light in the sky that appeared to have other smaller red lights below or around it.  The red light was as large as one of the planets and was due south of us.  It also appeared to be higher in the sky than the flight path normally taken by planes flying to our local airports. As the two of us watched it over a period of time of about 15 minutes, we observed three things in particular. First, the light would slowly get brighter, then dim, then get brighter, then dim.  At the brightest, it was red but as bright as Venus.  At the faintest, it was still as bright as most stars. Secondly, it appeared to be motionless for at least five minutes, if not longer as we first watched it.  We ruled out flares and fireworks of any kind because it was just there, not moving, just changing its brightness. Third, we realized that it was finally moving and appeared to be actually drifting up and to our left in an approximately 45 degree angle eastward. This took an estimated ten minutes. It then disappeared before it reached where the moon was but the moonâ€™s light was not the reason it disappearedâ€¦it just finally faded out completely.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135

Fake stars over San Diego, CA;2010-01-04 22:00:00;Noticed from dusk to dawn;Fake stars over San Diego, CA At turn of the new year, I stepped outside a moment before it turned midnight and noticed three red lights hovering. I would like to point out these are not the lights I'm referring to as these have been dismissed as a hoax. That being said, the red lights caused me to notice the sky more than I had been and my husband and I noticed at least a couple dozen stars that flicker, rather than twinkle as a star does. These lights can be either a silvery color, or golden, but they all alternately flash red also. The first couple nights, we just gazed in amazement and didn't notice too many details. But I do know they seemed to move very slowly if you watched them long enough. I don't mean that my perspective on them changed as Earth rotated I mean that they steered every so slowly to a different position and then stopped. They also seemed to be clustered in one small area around Orion's belt mostly, until Orion's belt moved out of sight. BUT even after Orion moved out of sight these strange fake stars would still be in the same area. They never left the area even after Orion (there are rarely any other stars visible in San Diego at night lately) was way out of sight due to the Earth's rotation. Nights of 1/3-1/5, I stayed out as often and late as I could given that I have three kids to take care of. I peeked out a couple times per hour, staying up late and watching them til 3 or 4 in the morning. They seemed to light in 1 position and stay there constantly for the most part on these nights, with the occasional one disappearing suddenly or shifting slightly. Colors remain same. I have noticed that there is one set that I call the Non-Rectangle, because if it weren't for one star being up and out a little bit too much, they would form a perfect rectangle. However, they are in a different configuration every night, i.e. the slightly off star would be on the bottom and left one night, and on top and right the next. Makes me think it's a craft that lands in a different spot every night and thinks we won't notice. 1/6 and 1/7, 2010 I have not been able to go outside to watch their behavior, I have just had too many things to do. I got video, in fact about 10 of them with my webcam since I don't have a regular camera, but strangely, I can't get them to upload to any of the sites I tried to upload them to. I managed to get 1 pic on my cell phone to show up and I will try to attach it. The oddest thing of all to me, is that no one else is talking about them, everyone is concentrated on the sham red lights of New Year's Eve that one guy hoaxed. However, my kids and mom see them, and so does my apartment complex manager, so they are truly there. One other strange detail is that on 1/3-1/5, there have been a highly unusual number of small, low-flying normal planes as well as helicopters, making me wonder if they're investigating.  I have not been able to stay awake and outside to witness them make their disappearance at dawn so I don't know what that consists of. They are currently still there, although small in number at this precise moment. I can't figure out for the life of me why people aren't interested in them.

Bright Amber Orange Light, Multi-Colored Object, Rapid Changing Lights.;2011-12-18 01:00:00;30 minutes;Bright Amber Orange Light, Multi-Colored Object, Rapid Changing Lights On December 18th 2011 a bright amber orange light was visible in the night sky over El Cajon California.  The Light was traveling from north to south very slowly.  This light was like nothing I have ever seen.  As it passed over head myself and witnesses could say it wasn't a plane because we would have seen flashing lights underneath the object.  Upon zooming in on the light it was multi-colored, and had what looked like, rapid changing lights.  The lights were orange, yellow and red, which seemed to be moving very fast in all directions and changing form.  Taking a closer look at the video and slowing it down it appeared to keep making the form of a triangle.  It doesn't make sense why these light which looked independent of one another made a bright amber orange light in the sky.  There was no sound emitted from the object, its rate of speed remained constant from north to south and disappeared over the hills.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Two erratic blinking lights spotted in East County that moved, vanished, reappeared, traveled, and finally disappeared.;2014-04-15 01:15:00;1 hour;Two erratic blinking lights spotted in East County that moved, vanished, reappeared, traveled, and finally disappeared into eastern sky. Me and my children saw 2 erratic blinking lights (resembling stars) in the northern sky (over Santee/Poway area) that stayed stationary for 20+min before slowly descending eastward toward the horizon.  Then, one of the lights flickered to nothing while the second light remained lit and descended even faster before disappearing into the northern horizon.  All of the sudden, my oldest daughter saw both lights (Still blinking) reappear in western sky within a minute after vanishing.  Then the two blinking lights slowly moved to the east above us, pausing for brief moments, only to continue moving eastward.  The blinking was very irregular, sometimes they remained lit (like to blend in with the stars), other times like a strobe, and blinking steadily as well. The lights seemed to remain right over us for sometime.  My oldest and I played a game with the lights (joking that we should try to communicate with whatever it was) as they moved right above us using our flashlight's strobe setting.  It was crazy as they were mimicking our own light pattern.  Eventually the lights moved closer together and further east as they finally faded out in the eastern sky?  I thought about weather balloons, planes, helicopters, satellites, but none of these would have that kind of activity! I even had my oldest daughter to confirm these lights, just before the vanished, then she found them in the western sky!;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Light went from barely moving, to shooting across the sky and disappearing.

I debated on whether or not my eyes were playing tricks on me and maybe it was a shooting star or meteor, but it seemed to be awfully close to be something like that.  It looked as though it was near the clouds.  Not to mention the way it went from barely moving like a plane to shooting off across the sky?
