To my surprize my cousin Sheree her two childern and her friend Lisa and her daughter knocked on my door. They were hysterical and said they saw a ufo, I in turn summed it up to they must have had too much to drink. They insisted that I go outside and that maybe it was still there. To my amazement it was there. From here I will discribe what I saw: It was a large clear sphere about fifteen feet in diameter and about four stories high. I remember the childern were crying with fear but all I could do was stand there with my mouth wide open starring at it. It must have remained ther for at least 20 minutes, I could see right through it and the stars behind it. It did have a thin cloud like substance on the bottom. The object made no sound and when if finnally took off it still made no sound but move extremly fast upward and over, faster and further than anything I've ever seen. I immediately went in the apartment and called called the police to report and ask if any one else had seen anything like I discribe. He said no and that was that. The next day I read that somewhere in the south a carousel shaped object was seen. Last but not least the strange thing about this whole story is my cousin and I never spoke of the incident for eight years and yet we spoke almost on a weekly basis. Eight years later when I did speak to her about it she said it was the first for her too. She also mentioned that the kids remember the clouds on the bottom of it where she had not but I had. If it were not for that experience I am sure I would not believe in ufos to this day. Sincerely, ((name deleted));32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
SPHERICAL BRIGHT OBJECT IN SOUTHEASTERN SKY OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY EARLY JUNE 6,2000!;2000-06-06 03:20:00;30 seconds;SPHERICAL BRIGHT OBJECT IN SOUTHEASTERN SKY OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY EARLY JUNE 6,2000! While heading east on I-8 as a front passenger in a car,I noticed an object in the southeastern sky about 45 degrees off the horizon. It looked like Venus does when it is at its VERY brightest in the western skies---same size and brightness. Perhaps a bit bigger and brighter,in fact. But it seemed odd to me to expect to see another object such as that or Jupiter,etc,there at that time. It did not move. It just hung in the sky. Then,suddenly,it started scintillating more and then it began to dim until it dimmed out so to speak. As if it had gone into a fog bank. But it was crystal clear out. All other stars were visible even though much further and smaller,of course. There was no mist nor a single cloud in the entire sky. No objects such as towers or mountains in the way. I've lived in the area for over 50 years(all my life)and am quite familiar with the night sky and terrain at all hours of the day and am a frequent traveller at that late/early hour on that highway. There were no aircraft in the air and this object never displayed blinking lights nor red or green running lights at any time. My son,the driover,did not see it in time because he was leaned back in his seat watching only the road while I (as I often do) was leaned forward and purposely observing the awesome night sky. He noticed how intent I was looking at something,so he asked me what was up and by that time the object had dimmed out totally. We both watched the whole sky intently and then were home about 10 minutes later and watched it further. Nothing out of the ordinary.

An unusual sight in the night sky of El Cajon;2001-08-31 22:00:00;15min;An unusual sight in the night sky of El Cajon At approx. 9:55pm my daughter came into my upstairs apartment and told me I had better come see this light thing in the sky.I went out of my screen door and looked up.Coming out of the S.E. was an extremely large dark orange light moving very slowly toward me in the sky.This light was strang in the way that it was a very dark brownish orange yet the light was so strong that I could not distinguish a shape.It was also in the same visual perspective as the moon at the time.This object moved in a wobbley sort of fasion it almost looked unstable.I called my wife out to see this thing with me and my daughter.I was moving slowly and then stopped and hovered for about 20 seconds doing this awkward little circle motion and the proceded to move forward again in the same slow fasion as before.By this time we had called our next door neighbor out on to his patio to see it. It stopped again but this time,it dropped something out of the bottom of it.First out of the right side what appeared to be a white blinking object many time smaller and then about 5 seconds later a slightly larger one more towards the left side.It then proceeded to fade out slowly at first almost in some sort of sequence.Then as if someone was turning on a dimmer switch it faded back in slowly and then shut off completely.I could tell that it was quite high in the sky because there were planes flying below it during it's presentation(we have two airports in close proximity to El Cajon . By this time about fifteen min. had passed from the time my daughter first saw it.There were no blinking lights on it and there was no sound and I just remember the hair on my arms and neck standing straight up as well.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Orange sphere over El Cajon.;2014-09-13 19:00:00;90 seconds;Orange sphere over El Cajon. At approximately 7:00PM, Saturday evening, September 13, I observed an orange sphere shaped object, motionless, about 35 degrees elevation from level ground with an estimated distance of 1/2 mile.  The sky was clear with clouds in the far distance.   At first I was convinced it was an amateur weather balloon, but it was very breezy out and the object did not move at all.  The wind was blowing out of the southwest at about 5 knots, gusting to 7-8. My viewing angle was north-northeast.  After watching the object for about 90 seconds, seeing no movement, I ran inside to get my binoculars for a closer look.  When I returned roughly 20 seconds later the object was no longer visible. I had an unobstructed view of the sky within a 120 degree arc of the sighting.  The approximate location would be near the intersection of Interstate 8 and Second Ave.  Approximate diameter of the object is 4'. No lights or illumination noticed.  The color was a solid international orange.  Guestimate of altitude: 800'.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
