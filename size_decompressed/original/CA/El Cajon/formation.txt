sting ray shaped objects fly in formation over el cajon;2006-09-05 21:00:00;30 seconds;sting ray shaped objects fly in formation over el cajon OK, I have never admitted to seeing anything out of the norm...at least on record. Two nights ago my husband and I were out on our balcony off of the 8E and 2nd street. We had our telescope out looking at the moon. My husband spots something and he say like what the heck is that? I am looking thru the scope and he says, point it at that, I’m like yeah let me just move this thing, refocus into our atmosphere and see...no luck. They were flying E to W. I am going to say about 200 feet off the ground, but they were big. Not like, I can see the pilot in the helicopter big, but I could clearly see the shapes and the light that emitted from the objects. The light that was coming off of them wasn't bright or noticeable. It was a grayish red, very low light. Almost like radiance. There were several craft (6 to 7 maybe) flying in almost a V formation (yes, like birds) Then one moved from one point of the triangle to the other, but the movements were not bird movements. Like jet formations more than birds, but these were NOT jets! The constant movement across the sky was very slow, but their movement when one changed its position in the formation was very fast. No wings, birds or bats, no noise either. The bodies of the crafts almost looked the shape of Sting rays (bodies only). We tried to tell each other that they were birds, but we both knew better. Yeah yeah that's it. Birds. Weird glow...almost too low to notice. We watched them as they appeared over the top of one roof until they past from our line of site over another roof. We see helicopters and planes in that area all of the time and in fact a small plane had just past over that area about 10 minutes prior. Nothing like that either. I have looked at the skies my whole life...over 30 now. I’m not some loopy person that can easily mistake one thing for something it's not. I am very skeptical and analytical. Both of us are. We didn't know what to do, we were kind of frozen...we knew if we took our eyes off of them, they would be gone. So we ! just wat ched them until they flew over our roof. If anyone else saw them, please let me know. It's kind of weird thinking you're the ONLY ONE!! :) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides only e-address.

get it together.;2007-11-08 23:00:00;on going;get it together. Hey how about updating your site every now and then?  it's  11/8 and you guys are still posting 10/8/07 sightings. ((NUFORC Note:  We agree.  I have just spent most of the last three days proofreading almost 750 reports, many, far too many, of which are atrociously poorly written.  NUFORC soon is going to change its policy regarding which reports we accept and post.  We apologize for the delay.  PD));32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Three red lights over the San Diego area - IT'S A HOAX YET AGAIN!!;2010-01-01 00:01:00;15 min.;Three red lights over the San Diego area - IT'S A HOAX YET AGAIN!! My brother and I went outside right after New Year to see if they were there, and sure enough, the idiot had done it once again, just like clockwork on every holiday!  We observed three red lights that looked like burning road flares floating a few thousand feet up in the dark sky, and we even watched as one burned out.  They appeared to be hanging and dangling in the light wind from a triangular frame of some kind. I've been told that the person claiming to have continually perpetrated this hoax had been interviewed on a San Diego TV news show in shadow to conceal their identity awhile back and had agreed not to do it again, but apparently they lied, or it's someone else doing it now.  Maybe it DOES fall under the category of UFO, but it's definitely terrestrial, and it's also a dangerous HOAX!;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
