I observed outside and saw three objects with blinking lights On the morning of July 19th, at approx. 3:30am I went to let my dog out. I noticed a bright light shining through my kitchen window. I looked at the light while I was out side, and then noticed one higher above the one lowest to the ground. The higher one had red lights blinking. As I looked past a tree in the neighbors yard I could see one that appeared to be a rounder one with blinking blue and green lights, and sometimes white. Sometimes the lights got dimmer. They were in kind of a V formation. I watched them until about 4:30am and then I went to bed. I also saw them the next three nights. They do the same routine. Maybe just a little different. There are electrical towers on a mountain where I think they hover over. I do not own a cam corder or I would have taken pictures of them. I will watch again tonight.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
We saw them again and now there are five objects with blinking lights;2004-07-25 02:02:00;2 hours;We saw them again and now there are five objects with blinking lights Starting on July 19 we saw red blinking lights and a really bright one which was low to the earths surface, by rhe mountains east of us. The one object has red blinking lights over the bright white one,and in the center of them is one that appears more rounded and blinks on and off with some red and green and white lights. The others appear the same but one is west and the other N.east front of the bright one. Today is Jully 26th and they are back again! We saw them last night also hovering and seemed as if they were peering at the electrical towers on the mountains.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
We saw the bright lights and others over the the hills near the mountains  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars??  ));2004-08-07 03:10:00;2 hours;We saw the bright lights and others over the the hills near the mountains I went outside to bring my dogs in and saw a huge bright light near the mountain area east of my location. I could see this clearly from my yard. There was one above the trees and one in the middle, one in the sky over the big one that was low. The one overhead blinked red lights. The others were dim, but would blink whitish, green, lights. There were also two in the sky looking west from my back yard. They are bright with blue, red, and green lights mixed with white. They hovered there for about 1 hour and then dissappeared. There were planes flying around them for a while, I just wondered if maybe they saw them? Or why if they couldn't. My sons friend was sleeping over and I woke him and my son to see the object that was bright over the hills. I wish I could get an explanation of what they are. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses were observing, but we suspect they may have been twinkling stars.  Just a guess.  PD));32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Ongoing experience , has not stopped yet.;2006-06-13 20:15:00;ongoing;Ongoing experience , has not stopped yet. I am Christian and was a serious skeptic about ufos until I had these encounters. The first time that I saw this aircraft I was driving in my car and was pulling into our bulidings parkinglot area and a and I just happened to look to left over my shoulder and not even a hundrd feet in the air was a what looked like a ufo it hovered for two mintues straight and made absolutely no sound. There was also a man outside on his phone who dropped his phone and stood and stared at he object. its lights were moving in a strange pattern. The lights were much like that of an airplane only much brighter and more crisp. The object shown a white light on my car then took off very slow at first ( still not making any noise) then took off very fast. It slowed down then stopped a few more blocks away and once again hovered. Since that day we have seen many more. I assume it is me, and that i am subject of interest. I use the same way to go to work and the same way to get back home every evening, and since that day I have noticed that I am being followed by not just one but several aircraft, and believe me I know how crazy this sounds, but seeing is believing.  when I stop at red lights they stop too and wait and on four different ocassions my light turned green when it shouldn't have , the other traffic was still going. this has been happening to me for almost four weeks, I haven't reported it because i thought i was going nuts. I mean it defies everything i was ever taught. I really don't understand it. I want to ignore it all but the keep showing up and they make themselves all too obviuos, I am just your average hard working loving mom and spouse, and I want this all to stop so much. I want my life to go back to normal, I want ot forget what has happened and move on with my life. Monitor the El Cajon CA valley PLEASE! there is tons of activity. You must be very careful not to mistake them for airplanes, I believe that they try to make themselves appear to be just like an airplane but when , you look closely enough you will see that they are not.

orange light flying through sky during new years.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible party lanterns??  PD));2008-01-01 00:01:00;5 MIN;orange light flying through sky during new years New year's eve we were on the porch about midnight, I looked up in the sky and saw an orange colored triangular shaped object. We all started arguing about what the object was, comet, plane, metorite, it looked as though part of it fell off of it , or another smaller craft seperarted from it. then it just turned off or used some sort of cloaking devise. then about 3 min later it reapperd for only a couple of seconds, then dissapered for good. haven't seen anything like this before and i've seen comets and meteors before. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible party lanterns??  We're unsure as to what the objects were, although one witness assures us that they did not act like drifting lights.

3 bright red lights in triangle shape eastern sky San Diego County;2009-02-24 01:15:00;10 min.;3 bright red lights in triangle shape eastern sky San Diego County appeared to be 1 triangle shaped object. there were 3 bright red lights in the eastern sky, seemed to be heading west / northwestern direction. Also seemed to be turning, as triangle shape went from am equilateral shape to a very tightly shaped triangle. As lights disappeared, they flickered away slowly, one at a time, starting with the top of the triangle, then the bottom right, then finally the bottom left.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Three red lights outline huge red triangle over San Diego Coutny sky.;2009-02-24 01:30:00;10 minutes;Three red lights outline huge red triangle over San Diego Coutny sky. 3 bright red lights forming a isosceles triangle, but almost equilateral. You could barely make out a very faint line in a off-glow red. An even fainter off-glow red inside the formed triangle. The size was too huge to explain. It seemed far off in the distance but still  large enough to be seen clearly, but to still realize that it was humungous. Maybe hundreds of feet between each light. Maybe 20 or more miles away. It was about thirty degrees above the horizon. It looked alot like flairs but there was no smoke. They were not rising or falling. This all took place over the course of 10 minutes or so. So there was plenty of time for an elevation change. Then it sort of rotated and pitched forward ever so slowly. The rotation was the lower left light seemed to move forward or maybe the right moved backward. As it levelled out it faded from view. Sort of just dimmed out. It didn't race away and take sharp turns or anything weird like that. I say weird, because what we saw seemed weird just a short while ago. It never came over our part of the county. # witnesses.Two middle thirty aged adults. M/F, some college, both work in the medical field. One helps SNF Nurses coordinate patient placement after hospital stay. The other works in the ER of a different hospital. The other witness, my neighbor, is a mid sixtyish, retired. His wife is a Hospice nurse and he did not want to wake her once it left. Both of tried to get a picture on our cell phones. I haven't talked yet to my neighbor to view his. Mine did not seem to pick it up. I'm an amateur with the five hundred billion app's that phones have. Anyway what we saw was valid.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
9 squares in a flying V but moved as one structure, silent, no lights, lit by the city lights below.;2009-04-21 21:40:00;2 minutes  +/-;9 squares in a flying V but moved as one structure, silent, no lights, lit by the city lights below. What my wife and I saw was triangular, silent, and the part that get's me is it had no lights at all.  It looked larger then the local aircraft which are small single engine four person planes.  There is an airport only a few block away from where I saw this and that's why I figure it should have been lit.  It was slightly lit by the city lights below and it looked like 9 squares in a flying V but moved as one structure.  I can't describe it any better than that.  Thatnk you for your time.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135

21 June 2013 low altitude aerial contact in triangle shape, shifting colors from port & starboard side with 0 noise(trained lookout)USN;2013-06-21 22:00:00;15 minutes;21 June 2013 low altitude aerial contact in triangle shape, shifting colors from port & starboard side with 0 noise(trained lookout)USN 			I'm sure of what i saw and described it on the phone exactly. 	This is my honest report on what i saw and will not reveal any personal info about myself.  On the 21st of june 2013 in el cajon, CA i was talking on the phone to someone outside smoking a cigarette and then i saw a bright white light over the hill come up abruptly then i noticed it was coming straight towards me in a residential district when it was flying low so i walked closer and interrupted the conversation to let the other person on the line know what i was seeing.  The light got closer and closer and was completely silent and had 1 main light in the middle and when it was coming towards me i saw lights shift from port(left) to starboard(right) and back and forth.  The lights changed colors and moved from both sides, port and starboard of the craft.  I've been in the navy as a logistics specialist (LS) and am a trained lookout for surface and aerial contacts on a ship and have seen many lights at a distance of nautical miles in open sea and in other countries and have nev! er seen an aircraft anything like this.  The person on the line was totally freaked out by what i was describing and i was totally interested in what was going on.   I would have been a lot more concerned if it stopped right over me, but instead it kept moving circling the city changing lights as if it appeared to be a plane at a distance but it was about 500 yards above me.  I'm used to giving locations of contacts off the port bow, so i would say that if when i was looking at it, it came up at 00 degrees or my centerline and moved in a circle at my centerline then zig zagged slowly moving to my port side up and over slightly to the left of me moving 2, then 2.5, then 3, then 4 points off the port bow (as if i was locating it on the ship with MSC-Military Sealift Command type navigation as my ship was crewed as part navy and part MSC)(wont give name or country) and kept moving eventually out of sight.  Then a low flying plane flew right over me about 5 mins after the event and ! i could clearly see the difference. Not to mention my phone so! unded like it was staticy like i was being listened to.  I wouldn't be surprised because it was a non-secure line.  The thing is we never see anything flying low at 2200 at night in a residential area as i go out a lot to smoke a cigarette.   I know that this is not that detailed, but it was very detailed on the phone.  My phone couldn't zoom in to take pics, but for whatever its worth i wanted to let people know i'm a credible veteran who was honorably discharged 2 months ago to go to college and i saw this right outside the house and didn't know what else to do but write it down. I just googled how to report ufo and here i am. A drone would have made noise, even if it were a static noise. We need full disclosure and we need it now more than ever with the protests around the world because we see all the lies and secrecy.

Metallic triangle object moving fast with no vapor trail.;2018-03-25 10:00:00;33 seconds;Metallic triangle object moving fast with no vapor trail. I was in my backyard and looked up to the sky when I heard a passenger airliner flying overhead, I soon noticed a very light gray in color triangle shaped object moving quite quickly in a south direction... There was no sign of a vapor any kind of trail following it as one would see on most jets, military of commercial... I also noticed that the lines did not seem to be sharp angles but almost a roundness to them at the points, one other thing I recall is the body seemed to have a bit of a metallic finish... The object was lost in the high cloud formations...;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
