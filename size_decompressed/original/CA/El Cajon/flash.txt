The object kept gliding across the sky then 2 objects seperated.  One looked like a fireball crashing and the other kept gliding across the sky.  Clouds remain with the glow of light.  Then disappear into the sky.  I have footage. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 17:26 hrs..  PD));32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
