I have been noticing many sightings of orange/red/amber color UFO reports lately.  I've been telling folks for years of my sighting,   they came from the east and stopped about 20-30 feet from us , they were the size of a car,silent blinked lights  at us ,very bright red  many times taking turns with each other then one would shoot straight up hundreds of feet in a blink of the eye then return back and the other copy this motion also  . They were playing with us I felt,  then they slowly moved west at the end of our street under a lamp post they merged into one and  became a large circle of colored lights then went into itself, gone in an instant just gone   Maybe a minute later 2 military jets flew over our house. I waited to hear if anyone saw them on the news. no reports  . could not see anything , just the light no body a very slight electric feel.  I made a report to the UFO reporting in San Diego ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Starting July19,2004 until now July22 I have seen some objects flying near my home;2004-07-19 03:39:00;4:42;Starting July19,2004 until now July22 I have seen some objects flying near my home At 3:39am while letting my dog out to the front yard, I noticed a bright white light shining over houses near the mountain near my church. There are electrical towers there. Above the one bright white looking light is something that looks round, but has red lights. Just beyond my yard is a tree and I could see another one there, and had lights that blink green and sometimes a blue and white. It seemed like the one that was red follows the one closer to the earth. Kind of like a V formation. I have observed this same sighting for four days in a row. I wish I owned a video cam corder, but I don't have one!At 4:49 I watched the one near the earth fly into space and dissappear within seconds. I tried to look at the shape of the bright white light near earth but it sometimes looks diamond shaped and then sometimes it looked more triangular. It was hard to tell, but the others appear to be rounded.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
