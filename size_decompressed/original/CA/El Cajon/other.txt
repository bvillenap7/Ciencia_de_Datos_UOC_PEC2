A creature crossed my path and ordered me not to hurt it, as I was driving at the time.;1969-08-15 19:00:00;5-7 seconds;A creature crossed my path and ordered me not to hurt it, as I was driving at the time. When: August 1969.  Aprox. 7:00 PM. Where: El Cajon, California on the road to Dehesa above the golf course at the crest of the hill traveling east from El Cajon past the golf course and on to the Dehesa area where our mobile home was hooked up. Weather: Warm, clear and still light evening with good visibility. Traffic: None in either direction at the time. Personal Physical/Mental condition: I was returning home after a challenging and rewarding match of class B handball at the La Mesa YMCA.  I was an accomplished athlete at the time and was driving home to my family showered, refreshed, comfortable, well rested, in excellent condition and sober. Event: As I was negotiating the paved roadway, following the lazy turn to the left at the top of the hill, a creature strode up from the steep hillside on my right and without breaking stride, looked directly at me and directed me to, DON’T HURT I.  ((witness recognizes grammatical error in telepathic message.  PD))  The three words were clear and precise but without sound. The powerful engine sounds did nothing to dampen the order.  My mind heard the words, not my ears. I backed off the accelerator and slowed slightly while the creature completed its brisk upright walk across the road from right to left (south to north) and up the cut bank on my left. At no time did the creature break stride or exhibit any difficulty managing the steep terrain, especially going up the man-made and much steeper cut.  It was as it stepped onto the pavement that it regarded my presence and sent its order not to hurt it. Had I so desired, I could have run it down.  I estimate my speed before slowing to be around 45 MPH but was not conscious of my speed at the time, nor did I look at the speedometer either during or after the event.  Higher speeds are dangerous at that spot in the road. What struck me was the creature appeared to me a bright blue—sky blue and intense. It was clothed in a neat double-breasted tight fitting or tailored suit with matching pants and a flat-brimmed hat. Exposed skin was exactly the same color as the clothing (sky blue). I could see no wrinkles or folds as the creature progressed across my path. The creature had almond-shaped eyes and a tiny mouth but otherwise was basically human size and human shaped. During my next trip through that stretch of road, two days later, I parked and examined the spot where the creature had emerged.  The terrain is steep with native trees and Chaparral, which makes a difficult hike for anyone, yet this creature had no difficulty climbing it. I also tried to climb up the 5-6 foot cut bank but could not scramble up without clawing and grabbing handholds and footholds, yet the creature easily strode up the angled hillside upright without straining. I felt no fear at the time and I wish I had taken the time to try to communicate with it but driving at that location takes concentration.

two friends in daytime view multiple statiopnary lights for more than 15 min in El Cajon, Califoria.;2014-01-20 16:40:00;20 minutes;two friends in daytime view multiple statiopnary lights for more than 15 min in El Cajon, Califoria. I was on friends large property in El Cajon when I saw a friend of mine in the back yard staring up into a clear blue cloudless sky.  I asked Yo, Don what are you trippin on?  He replied that he was watching a plane pass up in the sky when he noticed a fixed object (not moving) in the background of passing plane.   I at first thought ok your full of crap but I will look.  As my eyes stared and adjusted to the daylight it took a moment aprox. 2-3min before sure enough plain as day with the naked eye I could see what to me looked like maybe a high altitude weather ballon or possibly a planet being able to be viewed during the day if that where possible.  For at least 5 min I stared at the said object with my friend.  He asked if I had binoculars handy and I did.  I then walked to my trailer and was able to zoom into the object for a better look, what I saw I can only say I dont know what it was but what I thought would be a white object was actually one very bright light then turning to two.  It in my estimate was higher than any commercial airliner and seemed to not move except at one point it seeemed to drop closer to us.  What was even more bizarre was that higher above the said object there to me appeared to be a circular shadow.  We viewed the primary object plain as day for aprox 15-20 min.   When the experience was near over my friend was looking through the binoculars and I with the naked eye.  To me in a fraction of a second it vanished.  Now although the circular shadow was not visible to the naked eye I did see it faintly before the light was gone.  Like I said, to me looked it had the appearance of a far distant planet.   I did not think at all what I saw was light coming from something.  As I viewed the one light became two lights.  Looking through binoculars my friend saw the said object split into three and vanished I can say I for one did not see that.   It was  Jan. 20th 2014 at 4:43pm.  El Cajon, California ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport,  Sorry it has taken me a bit to get back to you, consequently I have been a bit busy lately. As for your question I can say in great confidence that over 17 years as a sport boat captain I know good and bad quality when it comes to binoculars I had a pair of expensive Minolta binoculars I used that day with a special rubber end cover that blocks out even the smallest amount of light that may enter through the sides when viewing. The reason I know the light changed from one to two then three was to me it looked to be pivoting or slowly spinning around in it's stationary spot. So what my grasp of it is that whatever it was it was rotating in a way that aloud me to see it like a car rounding a turn and you see the first headlight and as it completes the turn the second headlight comes into your view. I hope this analogy helps you a bit.  Like I mentioned before I have seen a lot of stuff in my time yet I can't for the life of me explain exactly what it was. I do appreciate you listening since nobody else does. I am an upstanding citizen with a perfect driving record I have never been known to be a fabricator of crazy stories I look at everything with an unbiased mind my reputation with friends is my honesty and trust I have built with many.  I look forward to any questions or insight you may have for me.  Thank you again and have a great day. ((END ADDENDUM));32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135

I have complete images from February,27,2021 through March,10,2021. Through my camera saw green light up ball,  this green glow flies around near lights and could only be seen through camera that zoomed in a bit.  I also took images of green glowing lanterns, colored spiral balls . March ,9,2021 caught ufo image through Live Photo taken, with bright light beaming down from really far I couldn’t see the start of the light. They won’t leave me alone there always here every night I’m starting to feel scared. I’m unaware of what they’re capable of doing, or what they want .
