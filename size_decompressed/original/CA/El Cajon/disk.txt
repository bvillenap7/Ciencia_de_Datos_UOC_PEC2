I dont remember what day but this summer I was at a carpet job and i saw what i thought was a balloon. I watched it for a minute and decided it was not a balloon, it was dull black,looked like metal and It was shaped like a telescope lense. The object made slow tight circles and slowly drifted west. I watched it drift for about 30 min. I would say it was about 500/800 ft up maybe more I couldent tell how big it was but it drifted higher untill it was out of sight. The thing did act like a balloon but i am pretty sure it was something else. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135

Looking over Mt Miguel I saw a space craft move in unorthodox directions zipping very fast around the sky then glow different colors and eventually emanate blue and then went up and down several times and then seemed to land near Mt Miguel near rancho san diego.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
