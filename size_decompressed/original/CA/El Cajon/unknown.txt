The most critical thing is how fast and the angle it went at before disappearing.;2003-06-26 22:26:00;15 Min.;The most critical thing is how fast and the angle it went at before disappearing. Last night I was sitting in my backyard and looked almost striaght up at the stars for a few seconds. As I started to look down again I noticed 2 lights kind of low on the horizon barely moving west. My first thought was it was 2 helicopters following each other at a very slow speed. Since it took a minite or so to come to that conclusion I decided to play a joke on my wife and called her out to see. I just kept looking at them because something was just not right with my conclusion. Mainly because for as close as they appeared I couldn't hear anything. When my wife got outside and about half way to where I was I told her to stop turn around and look up. She started questioning them right away asking me what they were. Shortly after she got outside it appeared as the first one seemed to have sparks fall from it and seemed to have turned north as if the light came from the front because it became real hard to see so I focused on the second one which kept going west.Then the second one kind of stopped for a couple of seconds and also turnin the same direction the other one did. Since there wasn't anymore I really focused on this one as the light got further away. This time noticing the direction was north but it also was climbing in altitude kind of like when watching an airshow and watching the plane as it climbs to a point until it stalls, but this kept going. Then the light seemed to disappear and I remember saying it's gone right as I said that it faintly reappeared and (this is where I really started to question what we were seeing) We both saw it shot up and I mean up and in two kind of swooping motions (the dot of light became a trail slowed down and did it one more time) and it was gone nothing like we have ever seen before nothing. I am 31 y/o and I have alwayed watched our airforce jets as they fly around that are based in Miramar, seen all that latest tv shows regarding the usa's technology in jets, been to many of sky shows (blue angels) and never seen anything take-off like th! is did. The only thing I can think of is maybe there is a top secret aircraft that nobody knows about except for the select few. For some reason I just don't think that we have the technology, just by the way we send the shuttle or even satalights into orbit. They go up quickly about at the same angle these did, not even close to the same rate of speed.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
UFO heard above El Cajon neigborhood on 12/29/03 at 00:30 in the morning;2003-12-29 00:30:00;1 minute;UFO heard above El Cajon neigborhood on 12/29/03 at 00:30 in the morning Last night at 00:30 my husband and I had just laid down to go to sleep. After laying there for about three minutes, I heard this sound, some type of aircraft zoom in over my neighborhood, hover overhead, then zoom away.  This was not a plane or a helicopter, I could distinctly tell the difference, and I knew that something else was outside floating above my neigborhood. It sounded as if it could have been a plane, but planes do not move like this. It did not last very long, but it was very loud. I thought I was the only one that heard it but after telling my husband about it this morning he said that he heard it to and he knew without a doubt that it had to be a UFO because of how it sounded. I did not get up to look outside because it honestly scares me. I know that there are other beings out there however after seeing the movie SIGNS, I would rather know whether these beings were peaceful before I get up to look one face to face. Please feel free to contact me if you need more info.  I know that this is not an actuall sighting per say, but I know what I heard, and it was very real.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135

Red Lights Over El Cajon, California;2006-07-04 21:20:00;10 Minutes;Red Lights Over El Cajon, California On July 4, 2006, my son and I observed an object consisting of three red lights, which changed color often. The object was to our East, between Fletcher Hills and the City of El Cajon in California about 15 miles East of San Diego.  The lights appeared to be moving away from us slowly in an Eastward direction. The three lights formed a triangular shape, and the top light would pulsate on and off, as well as the red on all three lights would change in color and intensity. The red color was about as red and bright as a laser pointing device. There was numerous small aircraft in the area from Gillespie Field  (Three letter airport code: SEE)in El cajon and as well, many commercial airliners passing overhead (altitude would be about 3000 to 6000 feet for the commericial aircraft on this approach - yes I am a rated private pilot) in the approach pattern to Lindbergh Field in San Diego. However, the light pattern was not conistent with an airplane, nor was the movement consistent with either a helicopter or airplane. The object appeared to be steady (non-moving) for about 5 minutes, then it started drifting slowly to the ESE. The object then vanished. Our view was not blocked or obstructed, so it did not go behind a building, tree, cloud, etc., it just appeared to go dark all of a sudden. A small plane in the touch and go landing pattern at Gillespie Field (they use runway 27R during night ops) flew through the area within two minutes of us losing visual contact of the object. We tried to take digital photographs, but my son has yet to download them to the computer so we can see if we captured anything or not. This was also not mistaking the local fireworks displays going on around town, as we could not see any fireworks from our location and the object bore no resemblence to any fireworks. The weather was clear, with no clouds or low lying fog in the area - visibility was about 20 miles, temperature was approximately 80 Deg F, with light winds. We could see plenty of stars in and around where we saw the object both before, during and after the event. There was no sound heard from the object, nor was there any sudden movements. The appearence and disappearence were the only quick actions by the object, and the movement was similiar to a hot air ballon, in that it seemed to drift more than fly. We have seen many hot air ballons, and there was no flame present such as what a hot air ballon would have, only three red lights and a visible dark area between the lights, which we believed to be the structure of the object. I tried to logically explain what it was to myself since observing the object last night, but I can not come up with anything which I can say, yes that is what it was. I have had to file this in my mind as unknown or when my son asked me what it was, I said I have no idea kiddo and that is where it remains.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135

White flares from plane maybe?;2014-02-26 19:58:00;1 minute;White flares from plane maybe? Was driving southbound on HWY 67 last night just south of the 52, Gillespie Fields (KSEE) was to my West, there was a bank of clouds/fog moving in...   Just above the clouds were several flare like objects in the sky.   Looked for the last couple of hours to see if there were any reports but have not found any. To me it looked like an airplane dropping white flares but who knows...?;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Small object that dropped two sets of reddish lights, and hovered for some 15 minutes.;2014-02-26 20:30:00;15 minutes;Small object that dropped two sets of reddish lights, and hovered for some 15 minutes. Looked up in southwest sky and observed for some 15 minutes a slow moving object. It was almost at a hover about 3000 feet when suddenly it dropped off two sets of descending reddish lights on each side- like a light colored flare.  These lights went out within 5 seconds or so. The object then dropped the lights a second time with similar results.  The object also had one amber light that was always visible.It then disappeared.  There was no sound, and the object was difficult to discern in shape.  This was reported to the San Diego area FAA.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Two smoothly flashing lights appear above sky before end of lunar eclipse.;2014-04-15 02:00:00;~2 minutes;Two smoothly flashing lights appear above sky before end of lunar eclipse. Shortly after the Moon began to leave the Earth's umbra, I noticed 2 star-like lights lying (seemingly) motionlessly to the left of the Big Dipper.  They began to flash back and forth, in a seemingly inconsistent pattern. The flashing was not like that of a commercial aircraft's blinking, but rather a smooth transition from dim to bright.  They were exactly the same color as a bright blue star.  One light would make a short flash, and then another would a few seconds later, but the pattern was extremely irregular. The object then began to move across the sky toward the right of the Big Dipper and increased and slowed in speed.  I tracked it with my telescope until it made a turn and headed over my roof, where it then disappeared. Although it was too dark to make out a shape, I may have seen some thin wings. I couldn't make out the rest of the fuselage, however.  It was also completely silent.  I don't know whether or not the motionlessness was wind, true hovering or an optical illusion.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Red Orb over El Cajon again!;2014-07-08 22:40:00;2 minutes;Red Orb over El Cajon again! I was driving back from a restaurant around 10:40pm.   I was at a stop light, and I saw this red/orange orb in the sky so I told my friend who was in the car with me to check out that red light.  He looked up too, and within seconds it was flashing lights from each side, at that moment I thought it was just an airplane but I kept looking, and this orb dropped a red light which disappeared within seconds.  The orb was still in the sky, and had stopped blinking from the sides.  About a minute later the Orb looked like it was flickering, and started to disappear, but my friend said he could still see it in the sky while I was driving, and the light was very faint by this time.   I think it disappeared about 30 seconds after that.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135

Leading light was constant green (no flashing), trailing light was an intermittently flashing red and white light which when flashing was a consistent distance behind leading green light.  Travelling at very high rate of speed.  Went from one side of skyline to over Laguna mountains in less than 35 seconds.  There was no audible sound emitted.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
