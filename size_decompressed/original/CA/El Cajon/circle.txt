The area were I live is in the foothills area so there several small hills a a two thousand foot high mountain nearby with radio and tv towerslocated on top.  Anyway this object which I had postulated as an errand weather ballooon had decended quite gently toward a cell tower which was about half mile away, I would guess it was about 4000 feet in the airnot so sure about size, but would guess about 50 feet in diameter.  Was now able to get a good look at it was gold in color with a smoke appearance to the surface. The surface had small circular endentions much like a golf ball, the afternoon sun also seem to create shadows in the indentions.  Was considering calling local airpot tower to let them know a balloon was in flight path of small aircraft, also had a concern for larger craft as the area is in partial pattern area for large craft. as I fruther watched the craft a smaller red spheer came out of it , I suppose from the back of it  out of my view anyway it circled the larger spheer in counter clockwise pattern, about five time, increasing speed with each revolution, then left in a easterly direction at the speed of a jet aircraft. At this point I asked some of the kids in the circulr area in front of our house to look at this object with me and tell me what they saw.  At that moment a white spheer came out of the object and circled around the bigger balloon-spheer , in a clockwise direction, and left in westerly direction had to be moving as fast a a F14. At this point a ran inside grabed a pair of weak binocs, came back outside just in time to see 16 small spheers emerge out and circle and leave in a easterly direction. They were dark blue or black. Upon this occurance the kids in front of our house went wow. I inspected the craft with binoculars, no protrusions or anything. Again a short time past then 16 more spheers, they left in westerly direction. following the white sphere,  The Larger spheer then slowly began to gain altitude, and left in the direction from which it came ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

4th of July, 2004, 2 giant red lite oval/circle shaped objects over El Cajon, CA, for apx. 1 hour.;2004-07-04 20:30:00;45 minutes;4th of July, 2004, 2 giant red lite oval/circle shaped objects over El Cajon, CA, for apx. 1 hour. On July 4th, 2004, my girlfriend and I took our dog out for a wake at apx. 8:15 pm, to witness the fireworks that would be going off at apx. 9pm. We did not know where any of the fireworks would actually be, but we just set out for a stroll and catch a glimpse of any festivities around our neighborhood. At apx. 8:30 pm, my girlfriend noticed in the Northeastern sky, 2 giant red oval/circle lights in the sky. It was apx. 2 miles from our location, and maybe a mile or more up altitude wise. Considering the distance and altitude, I guessed that they were apx size wise to be maybe a few hundred yards long and maybe 250 yards wide, they probally were a lot bigger. To describe them I will say they seemed to be fuzzy or had an aura, no solid edges, and it  seemed they might have been somewhat flat, definetely red. They appeared to be somewhat oval/circle like. There were no blinking lights noticable on either objects. They moved very slowly, and traveled side by side, but were independent of each other. One would move a little away from the other, but not far, then seem to come closer back to what would be a formation or safe distance from the other object. The speed as said, was very slow. As they moved towards the south, we would notice on ocassion they would wobble or vibrate, then go back to there normal slow direction heading south. Of course there were many other people out in front of their homes to witness the fireworks set for 9pm. I noticed apx. 10 or more people outside close by to us. I yelled over to the people close by us, and asked do you see those lights?, and they replied that the lights had been up there before we both had arrived, maybe 15 minutes or a half hour (I'm not 100% sure). Of course I did not have my digital camera to record the incident, and asked if any of the neighbors had something to get images of the objects. I asked if someone could call the TV stations or police, etc, but only got the silent treatment. We stayed in our position for apx 30 minutes until they were now overhead us. So that means these objects took almost a half hour to go apx 2 to 3 miles from the original position till they were directly overhead. They exhibited the same manuevers, moving away from each other, but never very far, then to come closier to each other. It looked like when they were overhead us, that at one time they looked like they were going to merge together, but did not. They did vibrate or wobble at intervals, maybe every 5 or 10 minutes, then to return to there slow smooth approach to the south. I could not stand still any longer and we returned home, so I could call the police. Both lights were still up in the sky when we did enter our home. I spoke to an police officier, and he said I was not the only one to call about the lights. That done, I went back outside to see if they were still there. I was planning on bringing my camera to photo, but was not sure if they were still there (I was in a hurry, and also figured they were moving so slow, I would have plenty of time to photo them). One was gone, and directly over our home was the last remaining light/object. And of course, it was going straight up at a much faster speed that they had ever exhibited prior. It continued to go straight up and then out of eyesight range, and was gone for good. I was surprised to not hear of any news or information concerning this sighting on any local news or television stations, etc. This sighting has bothered me since that time, and I just  now (1/15/05) deceided to see if any one else has seen this same event. So I typed in UFO Red Lights over El Cajon CA, on July 4th 2004, in the search engine Ask Jeeves, and came to this website. And so I find now (6 months later) that  there were indeed other wittnesses to this event. I to, like others that have voiced their opinions, think that on New Years Eve, and 4th of July celebrations, is the perfect time to have a cover story for objects or UFO's to occur. Most people would say that it was only fireworks, etc. But it is quite obvious that no know aircraft exhibits such manuevers, shapes or discription.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135

The object then banked to the north gained altiude untill we could no longer see it. It did fly under its own power except for the abscent of sound.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
Two bright red lights in the sky over El Cajon/San Diego;2005-08-20 23:00:00;few minutes;Two bright red lights in the sky over El Cajon/San Diego Like many other before we noticed two bright red lights in the sky moving side by side at aircraft speed. However, there was no noise,no typical aircraft blinking lights, they were just bright red light quite appart from each other making them two distinctive objects.  This is the third time that we see them in the same area South/East El Cajon. This time they seemed closer and were fliying toward us so we waited for them to get close enough to try to make a distiction but they suddenly changed direction dimming and disapearing in the sky.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
