My wife and I were in our backyard enjoying a fire after a break in the rain when in the direct east over the hills of Dehesa I noticed what I thought was a star, but it was amber in color and as I watched it, it slowly rose straight up at a very consistent and measured rate.  Once I realized it I motioned to my wife, whose back was to it, she turned and noticed it.  As soon as she saw it the object shot directly north at an incredible speed and out of sight.;32.7948533783783;-116.944385135135
