Well tonight i saw it with my own eyes.  I believe I saw something very different. It was about 11 pm monday night.  I was in Loleta California a friend and I sitting in the car. I was looking out towards the ocean.  I noticed a white light in the sky and it was flickering with red and green.  I noticed it was moving. I had to ask my friend if he saw,  what I saw.  He said, yes, I see it too.  We watched this light in the sky for about 20 minutes.  It was a distance away.  We feel it was quite a ways out in the ocean. This object was racing back and forth, up and down. It did a figure 8's.  I know that no airplane could do what I saw this light do.  Sometimes it would go straight down down down, then shoot straight back up.  It went on for so long.  I hoped I would see it shoot off in the sky.  The light just disappeared.
