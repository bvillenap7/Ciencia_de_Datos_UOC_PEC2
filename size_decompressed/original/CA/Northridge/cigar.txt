Me and my 3 rommates were playing poker on my bed, and my window looks on the street. we had only one night lamp on. after 4 rth round my roommate Karin went to close the window because it was getting cold and she called us. We all 3 went there and saw this very weird thing moving from south to north. three green cigar shaped flying objects. First they were slow, but then they got separated one of them went to east, the other two joined it like 5 seconds later and increasing the speed just dissapeared in the clouds. That was really scarey and creepy;34.2350352331606;-118.530728497409
