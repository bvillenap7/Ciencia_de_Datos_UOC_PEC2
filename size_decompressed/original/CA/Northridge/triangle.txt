The location was Northridge, CA. The night sky was pretty clear, the wind pretty calm, temperature was mild 60’s. I was in the backyard star watching which is pretty typical for my weekend evenings. Our backyard is on a south facing hill overlooking the San Fernando Valley, is quite dark for the Valley, and there are no homes behind us. From almost directly overhead a dark object caught my eye. As I focused it was a third round, or a rounded “boomerang” shape, of about seven or nine dark circles, I did not think to count them. It was pretty close overhead and moving slowly although it seemed to move past rather quickly. Its motion was very “smooth” and it was absolutely quiet. It moved from Northwest to Southeast with the center circle in front and the others tailing out left and right. It appeared and “disappeared” quickly. Not that it moved so far into the distance that I could no longer see it but that it just ! got so dark it sort of “disappeared” into the night sky. The entire time I actually saw it was maybe 10 – 15 seconds. My first thought was “what the hell is that?” But logically I assumed it must have been a string of large black balloons let loose on Halloween night, although there remained some small hint of my initial thought “what was that”. Then last night, 7 Nov, I Googled “why move to Florida” (nothing related to that night), and eight or nine results down I saw “A Florida parent and 18-year-old son report watching a large, fast-moving, boomerang-shaped object with no lights moved directly overhead on November 3”. I clicked on and read the article. I do not know what I saw that night, but the witness statements and description of what they saw could have been describing what I saw. Attached is a representation I made of what I saw that night. The entire object appeared to be just the circles which were a dark “grey”, or at least appeared to have no color or illuminat! ion that I could distinguish. Again it moved slowly and smooth! ly, had no lights, and made not a sound.;34.2350352331606;-118.530728497409
V shape dim orange lights moving fast and silent then faded into night sky;2011-10-21 06:00:00;10 Seconds;V shape dim orange lights moving fast and silent then faded into night sky OK this is the second time I am posting.   Searched through your sighting database and found first posting of my sighting on 10/31/10 at 19:30 in Northridge, CA, posted on 11/21/10   I had described as “rounded “boomerang” shape of about seven or nine dark circles”.  This time I was up early around 5 AM on morning of 10/21/11 so I grabbed a cup of coffee and went in backyard to watch the meteor shower from Halley’s debri.  Was an absolutely clear sky and I did see a couple good meteors and several weaker ones.  Also saw a couple satellites pass.  Was actually watching one of these when something else caught my eye.  At first is seemed like a very dim and tight cluster of stars, like looking momentarily at the little dipper.  And then I realized it was moving. It was a V shape with very dim “Burnt orange’” colored round objects, I can’t say lights, or globes, or even circles because I just couldn’t see that kind of detail.  It moved from the Northwest and to Southeast di! rection.  This time I really focused on it until it just got so faint it “disappeared”. Like last time it did not travel so far from sight that it just got so small or distant that I could no longer see it, it just kind of faded into the night sky.  By this I guess I mean the object was so dark and dim that it was hard to see in the first place, as it moved away it got dimmer and until it was no longer distinguishable from the dark of the sky. It was so quiet out I could hear the leaves rustling from a very light breeze.  This thing did not make a sound. Description: V shape, point of V was the “front” of the object, or at least pointing in the direction it was moving. The point was one of five orange “lights” for lack of better description, the left side of V was three more orange lights, right side was one more orange light, I assumed it could have been at an angle where more lights might have been on the right side I could not see. Totally estimating/guessing elevation of ! around 1000 feet? Speed again guessing 50 to 70 mph. Seemed to! glide o r float but pretty fast, and again dead quiet. Sighting location was the same as last time, Northridge, CA, just above the 118 Freeway, my backyard which is south facing. Seriously have no idea what this was, but it definitely seemed to me to be some sort of propelled object, not balloons, not a plane or helicopter.  Again no idea what it was, but this time I know I saw it.;34.2350352331606;-118.530728497409

It was shiny and hovering, planes flying behind and infront of it. Then 10 minutes in the object would move away from us till it was really small then come back and visibly larger, estimating 15-20feet long. Then it disappeared 3 mins later appeared again. Showed us its belly which was visibly darker and a triangular shape. Then poof it was gone. With no sunglasses you could only see the object.. with polorized glasses we could see a ring around the object. My family has always been making fun of me and they have all officially seen it and believe it. I have a picture as well;34.2350352331606;-118.530728497409
Several aircraft spotted darting across the clear blue sky;2021-08-07 18:15:00;10 minutes;Several aircraft spotted darting across the clear blue sky I saw several triangle shaped aircraft with white lights cutting through the sky which appeared to light up and reappear across the sky somewhere else very quickly and turning very quickly. They were darting in and out on a clear blue sky afternoon.;34.2350352331606;-118.530728497409
