It then passed over me  very quickly in an eastern direction and  disappeared.  It shape was similar to an open oyster shell.

The plane appeared to be a private Lear type jet.   As it was working its way  up, this chrome craft was on the port side, very close.   It then appeared to drift toward the back, and then cut across to the starboard side back. We were at an intersection in our car, stopped, when we saw this, at the corner of Balboa Ave and Plummer St. in Northridge.   I feel I could definitely rule out military or recreational planes in formation as I see them frequently and know what that looks like.   Definitely a lear type jet and a chrome object.;34.2350352331606;-118.530728497409
