The object seen today by three witnesses in Northridge, California along the 118 West Freeway towards Porter Ranch resembles and is commonly known today as the fireball that everyone has been reporting however it may look like a fire ball but it is not.  It is an actual craft that looks like a fireball with a tail. We were completely under this object for about 8-10 min and it simply would not move. Being under it and because of the sunset we could completely see a flat bottom surface (it was hugeas we can see small commercial airlines).  The colors were red/orange (like fire). It looked like a comet, but it was motionless/stuck in the air frozen.  But what it did next was completely astonishing and amazing.  The object went out like a dimmer switch/light/lamp and within 20-30 second it reappeared completely over our shoulder/north-east within unbelievable speed that no convention aircraft and conduct.  It basically went out like a light and appeared within an! other location.;34.2350352331606;-118.530728497409
