30 UFO's in a uniform line over the Nor-Cal pre-dawn sky, 02/08/2020;2020-02-08 05:45:00;5 minutes;30 UFO's in a uniform line over the Nor-Cal pre-dawn sky, 02/08/2020 My wife and I were out back early to see the moon and stars before morning light , and after a few chilly minutes we saw a satalite, then 2, one chasing the other, we thought. Then 4, then 5, 6, 8... They were just appearing out of the darkness of the southwest sky, moving fast to the northeast in a single file line, almost all equally spaced and equally bright. As bright  as any star in the sky. At one point they spanned from horizon to horizon, all moving in a line at the same speed and totally quiet. A video and still photo show the craft to be two lights spaced apart and oriented at  around a 15 degree angle, all the same orientation... It had all the hallmarks of a small invasion unit, visiting us this morning. I am still shaking an hour later, it's just now getting light outside. I called 911 and reported it as it was happening, We were terrified... This was not normal, I watch the night sky and stars all the time, especially early predawn mornings. Freaky...;39.3017;-120.9717
