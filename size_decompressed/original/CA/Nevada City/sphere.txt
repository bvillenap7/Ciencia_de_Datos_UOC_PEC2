This is the second idental spotted craft tonight 45 minutes apart. I reported a identical sighting less then 45 minutes earlier.  However this one was 180 degrees N East of the previous sighting.  Red glowing to blue then green lights, hovering motionless.  My wife and I both witnessed this one as well.  I believe the sightining previous to this one was the same craft.  The craft had changing circular lights of various colors. ((NUFORC:  Reports seems to us to be reminiscent of twinkling stars.  Anonymous report from same source as reported two hours earlier.
