I noticed a red glowing to blue & green sphere shaped object.  I called my wife out to check it out. She brought the binoculars and we took a closer look.  Well it wasn't moving almost stationary, and the colors where changing farely rapedly.  then the horizontal colors would move to a cigar vertical shape with streams of blue line like lights, like lightning or electrical storm effect. The shape changed from cigar to prism with multi color lights again in a circular pattern. ((NUFORC Note:  Report seems characteristic of a twinkling star.  Anonymous report.
