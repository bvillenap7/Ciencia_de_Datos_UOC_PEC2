I work nights and was taking a break. I happened to look out the window to the north and observed three white starlike lights in a equal sided triagular form moving in unison slowly across the sky. They looked like the background stars and I would not have noticed them had they not been moving. The lights must have traveled across a large expance of sky before I saw them. In a few seconds, the top light and the bottom right light just went out and the third one on the left fizzled out. Like it went behind clouds. I got the impression that it was way out there but plenty large enough to make out the shape. I think it was located above Sierra County, Ca to our north.;39.3017;-120.9717
