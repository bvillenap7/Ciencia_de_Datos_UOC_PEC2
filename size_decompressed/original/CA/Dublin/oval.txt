As I rounded the hilly section and approached the straight part of the road, the object appeared to the right front of my car.  It was approx 70 feet above ground, about 100 feet away, hovering with very bright lights flashing across the side of the craft.  I was traveling close to 70 MPH but slowed quickly to 55 MPH.   As it crossed in front of me, going from right to left I could clearly see the symbols the lights were flashing.   A series of triangles followed by a series of squares flashing on then off repeating the same series over again.  The craft continued to climb to a higher elevation, about 200 feet off the ground, following the center divider heading towards Dublin (north).   There was no sound coming from the craft, when the flashing lights turned off, it was very difficult to see the object due to the object was entirely black with no windows.   I followed the craft close to 10 minutes watching the flashing lights turn on and off with the same series of triangles and squares.  At about 20:40 the craft hovered over the 680/580 interchange then turned towards Castro Valley (Western direction).  The best description of the craft is that it appeared to be black, disk shaped due to the location of the lights, about 4 highway lanes wide and about 20 feet in height.
