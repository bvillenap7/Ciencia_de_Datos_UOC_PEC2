My wife and I and my mother-in-law were outside and noticed a string of lights not flashing, green and red, approximately 8 miles above the flight path to Oakland and San Jose which is only a 3 mile above sea level flight pattern.  The array of lights, which I thought were drones, which were to high to be drones were in a close to pattern like formation.  They flew in from the west, disappeared and then two minutes later showed up at a 90 degree angle turning to fly south..  My wife is already finding posts on Facebook about what we witnessed, itâ€™s crazy.;37.7201;-121.919
