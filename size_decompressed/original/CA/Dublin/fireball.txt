To S, emerging just above the treeline, moving W to E, a white fireball similar to a jet engine.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris. PD);2016-07-27 21:35:00;1 minute;To the south emerging just above the treeline, moving west to east, a bright white fireball similar to a jet engine was seen with appropriately six small point-like yellow to red-orange lights trailing behind it closely.  The white light moved straight and smoothly while the six or so smaller lights moved above/below and curved left/right, always trailing the larger light as if it were tracking the larger white light.  The group was at or below the clouds at the time of sighting and maintained that altitude and exited my sight to the west and entered a cloud layer.  All of the objects left a smoke-like trail with the larger white light leaving the most visible one.  I could hear no sounds from the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Reported to be re-entering Chinese rocket shell.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides lttle contact information.  PD));37.7201;-121.919
