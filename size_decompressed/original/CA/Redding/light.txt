Two amber lights moving at the same distance apart beginning at one end of Redding and ending in the north eastern direction above Redd;1997-07-04 22:00:00;~5 minutes;Summary : Two amber lights moving at the same distance apart beginning at one end of Redding and ending in the north eastern direction above Redding.  The lights dropped another WAY brighter light that was white to the ground.  Then the most awesome part was that they just disappeared.  My husband, self and six year old daughter witnessed this. While driving East on Lake Blvd. in Redding, my husband pointed out a set of two lights that were not normal in formation nor in appearance for an airplane.  They were, from where we stood, approximately a quarter of an inch big each, amber in color, moving slowly north by north east?  When we pulled over to the side of the road after the first minute or so we realized they were not airplanes nor were they any other conventional type of air vehicle.  These were two lights going next to each other, approximately two inches apart, in unison as if hooked at the middle.  We could not differentiate if they were indeed hooked or not, but if hooked together by something this object would have to have been huge.  While sitting there freaking out at these lights, seeing them not blinking, or anything else, moving slowly, they headed north.  After a period of approximately 3-5 minutes, the further away of the two lights moved upward and dropped a giant white light from its bottom an!d this light was five times the size of each of the orange lights and dropped to the ground completely.  It was a huge white light that was so bright that it hurt our eyes.  The two other amber lights, still virtually in unison went out at that point and one popped sort of red for a second as they went out then disappeared completely.We are awestricken!  It seems that even though we stood near our car atop a big city hill gaping and screaming it's a ufo that nobody else stopped, however, someone had to have seen these...they were too obvious.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

Different heights and distances from my position. NOT stars, planets or aircraft. I have been witnessing a recurring sighting of something in the sky over Redding since the 21st of September.  The object(s) are still appearing as of tonight, the 12th of October.  These objects have been witnessed by three of my neighbors as well as my Grandmother, my Nephew and another friend.  The first object appears in the western sky at around 7:10 PM.  It slowly, almost imperceptibly, traverses the sky in a diagonal, downward track until it reaches the crest of a mountain called Boley Mountain which is roughly 6 miles from my location. It then disappears on the other side of the mountain.  Within three minutes, the object, or another identical object, appears in the northern sky, roughly 30 degree's above the horizon.  From this position, it tracks opposite from its path in the west until by 12:30 AM, it is very high in the northeast.  The object does not get much higher and does not move east or west.  The latest I have watched it is 2:30 AM.  At that time it had moved slightly south.  I got up at 4:30 AM about four nights ago and saw nothing but stars, the moon and planets.  I noticed on the 28th that another, seemingly identical object would appear in the eastern sky at the same time this object moved.  The eastern object must be either over or just east of Redding Municipal Airport.  On October 4th I started finding more of these objects in different positions around my location or encircling Redding.  On the 5th, I counted 16 that I could see.  These objects can only be identified as bright white, green and/or blue and red lights with the red light appearing to pulse or rotate around something.  Very reminisent of the old police bubble gum lights or maybe lights reflecting off of one of those aluminum christmas trees.  None of the witnesses, including myself, have been able to see a discernable shape.  I am using a fairly new pair of 20X50 Tasco binoculars to view this.  Not the best but I all I have available.  My neighbor, who was actually the first to see this, has tried to view the object through his 35mm camera using a 300mm telephoto lens.  Still could not make out what it is.  He took some time-lapse photographs of the first object but is not confident of the outcome since all he had was 200 speed film.  I have snapped several photos using a Kodak Max one-time use camera.  I know these will either be blank pictures or of poor quality but they are at least pictures.  Since I am now dealing with so many of these things it is difficult for me to list every objects position and behaviour.  Some of the new ones to the southwest actually appeared very close to the ground. However, being night time and not knowing the distance of my binoculars yet, they could have been thousands of feet in the air.  I think they were close to the ground because of my location and knowing the area they appeared to be over.  I have sensitivity to bright car lights so could not investigate even though I wanted to. I am a white male, 47 years old and have spent the last 17 years working with computers, 14 of those with Tandy Corporation in Texas. I am currently a private consultant.  I do take medications but none would cause this level of hallucination.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

While driving to town to watch a movie with the family, my son pointed out a very bright light in the sky, moving just below the tops of the mountain range that surrounds our city. All four of us were captivated by the extreme whiteness of the light and the husband pulled to the side of the road for a better look. The light moved at a good pace horizontally for about 20 seconds longer then suddenly veered upward and shot out of sight in an instant. I actually saw tracers following it's sudden departure upward. There is no way it could have been any sort of known airplane or helicoptor. It certainly was not a bug or a spotlight reflection. It was totally silent and was close enough I am sure we could have seen the vehicle if it had been daytime.  No meteor could have possibly fallen and riccocheted back into space at this sharp of an angle. The color never changed or distorted, it was there and then it simply was gone.

bright white light in evening sky with cone shaped tail exploded and vanished.;2002-09-19 19:35:00;10sec;bright white light in evening sky with cone shaped tail exploded and vanished. A white light object a little brighter than Venus with a tail fan of about thirty degrees, in the west-south west sky about 40 degrees above the horizon was seen traveling from south to north.  There was no contrail behind it.  It seemed to explode and the vanished.  no smoke or residual was seen.  The sky was stll light just before dusk and there was a nearly full moon in the south east.  Venus ( I think it is Venus) was in the west.  No sound.  Subsequently notices a wavery contral low in the southern sky.  May have been associated but could see no direct connection.  It was moving fast but not nearly as fast as a meteorite.  It was quite large as compared to a jet liner, maybe 4 times as large.  I justhappened to be taking an evening walk and noticed the event.  Except that it was moving too fast, I thought it was a comet at first.  I think it may have been some kind of a rocket test that went wrong. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  Please see article.  PD)) ((BEGIN ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE ABOUT LAUNCH)) Air Force Test Missile Out West Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly, said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said. Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show. We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early, Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets. Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is, Gabel said. The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability. ((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS));40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Two bright lights, no sound, thin faint white trails behind then, travelled from west to east.;2002-09-28 20:15:00;2 to 3 minutes;Two bright lights, no sound, thin faint white trails behind then, travelled from west to east. We were outside sitting in lawn chairs in my drivway drinking a couple of beers and I noticed a bright light moving in the window of my truck. We looked up and at first I thought it was a bright satellite, as bright or brighter than Sirius. It did not change in instensity though and travelled in a east to north east direction. At a couple of points you could see a very thin faint white trail comming from it so I kewn it was not a satellite and was too slow to be a meteor and was not a jet. There was no sound then we noticed another one trailing behind the first that was about half as bright, and it too at one point gave off a light white trail. They both travelled togethere to the east until we could not see them anymore. They were both very bright, brighter than any star, were easily visible, and gave off no sound.

At first we thought it was just a star, but then it kept bouncing around and moving back and forth, in circles, and up and down.  At one point it looked like it was moving farther away from the earth, then it moved closer.  When we came back inside, it was still in the sky, but it wasn't really moving anymore, and just looked like a normal star again.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

Single light making 90 degree turns, starting and stopping instantly without acceleration.;2007-08-16 23:08:00;5 seconds;Single light making 90 degree turns, starting and stopping instantly without acceleration. I was staying at the Holiday Inn Express in Redding, California. At approx. 11:08 PM, I was in the outdoor pool floating on my back looking up at the sky. Near the constellation of Cygnus and Lyra, I saw a faint light (much like a faint star) moving south. There was no way for me to tell it's altitude nor it's speed, however, it's actual movement was puzzling. At first it was travelling south and passed by just west of Vega it's speed was constant. Suddenly it stopped instantly for a short moment (maybe for 1/2 of a second), then instantly returned to its original speed in an easterly direction. When I saw it do this, the first thought that came to my mind was, am I really seeing this? Is this my imagination? Yet still, I was able to continue following the object through the sky. And for a second time, it stopped instantly without any negative acceleration for about 1/2 second. The object then resumed it's speed instantly without any acceleration almost due south before dissapearing out of sight still high up degree-wise in the sky. I spent another 10 mins looking up but did not see anything more after my first sighting.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

We were facing south and right at 12:00 position was a ball of light that was moving towards us.  The object was bright and much, much lower than the stars - we thought it was a plane or helicopter.  We observed the object trying to identify the flashing red/blue lights that acompany aircraft.  This lighted object had none.   We watched as it glided through the sky in a northern direction.  It would drop then continue, drop then continue - it never stopped but it took a long time to cross the sky.  We watched for a good five minutes until we had to walk out into our street to see it (now behind our home) suddenly, it was gone. It never darted away, it didn't drop like before - it was simply gone.  It looked to be following the route of our freeway.   Less than one minute after it vanished, a jet-type plane flew overhead in the direction of the lighted object. ((NUFORC Note:  We will check with the witness, to confirm the time.

I was standing in my back yard facing south looking up at they sky.  I was smoking a cigarette cause I do not smoke in the house.  While looking up in the direction of the stars that make O’ryan ((sic--Orion)), when I was talking to my son showing him the stars.   My son then pointed out a light in the sky moving.  He said it looked like an airplane but saw not flashing lights and was way to high. It looked more like a star moving really fast, when I finally noticed it.   I then called my wife out and 3 of my children came out too, we all watched it but thought maybe it’s a satellite. While watching the light moving at a very fast speed, it stopped.  The star the sat in one spot for about 45 seconds.  That is when it started moving slowly in a sort of circle motion but did not complete a full circle, and then just shot in the East direction EXTREMELY FAST!!   Stopped and sat for a few, then started moving kind of longitudinally direction, back and forth about 4 times.  Still have not seen any colors or anything, still looked like a star just had life to it.  It would also move in the latitudinal  direction back and forth, but at a faster speed then longitude.  It was at this time of 7:40 pm on Tuesday, Feb. 22 2011.   That I decided to contact someone.  Unfortunately, it was dark and did not have a video device to capture evidence.

I was driving home from work on Interstate 5 north and was about 1 mile before the Twin View Blvd exit.  I glanced over to the left (west) and saw a very bright light at about 10 o'clock position.   This object then started to drop straight down and took about 5 seconds to disappear into the hills.   I don't think it was a meteorite because of its totally vertical descent and the time it took.   It was quite brilliant and much brighter than anything in the night sky.  I thought it might possibly have been a helicopter but if it was then I'm sure it crashed and I have not seen anything in our local news media to show that.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

Lighted craft hovers over Shasta Bally Mountain electronics.;2013-07-04 23:47:00;1 minute;Lighted craft hovers over Shasta Bally Mountain electronics At 11:47 PM July 4, 2013, Redding, CA - I was sitting outside facing the west where I have a clear view of Shasta Bally (approx. 11 miles due west as the crow flies)- a mountain between Redding and the west coast.  It has quite a bit of electronics on the summit - TV and radio  transmitting towers, microwave repeaters, etc. I noticed a ‘star’ start to drop straight out of the sky straight down on top of Shasta Bally.   As it came closer to Shasta Bally is got bigger and brighter then is stopped and hovered over the mountain - it was about the size of a silver dollar sitting over the mountain and it was an extremely bright white light illuminating the mountain. It hovered there approx. 30 seconds and then moved to the right then back where it had been and then back (to the west) dropping down behind the mountain (which really illuminated the mountain even more) before it shot up and out of sight leaving a tracer line as it disappeared into the sky. This is not the first sighting there have been at least 6 in the past 5 months with 2 ( 2-3 weeks ago) in one night.  One was a bright white light and the other was a bright red light.  I saw them within 10 minutes of each other.  Before the sighting on July 4th they only hovered for a few seconds before darting off leaving a tracer line and disappearing into the sky.  Their  hovering size was not as large and bright as the one on the 4th. I saw another on Friday night 7/5/13 which acted like the others - didn’t stay very long before leaving. I go outside to smoke several times at night so what are the odds - I’ve seen so many?   The number of visitations per night must be astronomical.

I usually look very carefully for areas that are darker than the night sky, hoping to see one of the black triangle craft.   I was only out for a few minutes looking at the area of Taurus, and a reddish orange star just appeared.  It was almost in the middle between the two stars that make the horns of Taurus.  It was a little brighter than Aldebaran, and then got slightly brighter.  I was watching it for a few seconds not sure if it was a star or not when I could see that it was wavering slightly side to side.   It then started moving slowly in an arc heading east.  I knew then it was not a star and started to walk to my door to get a camera and binoculars when it gradually began to fade out.  I went in, noted the time, and got the binoculars.   I checked the area with the binoculars and could see nothing.  The only thing I can think of is that I saw a meteor directly end on.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

I followed it assuming it was a sattilite, but then another one appeared from the same empty space following the exact course and speed as the first light.  Then another, and another untill I counted ten in all. Each moved across the sky perfectly spaced never excellerating or slowing.  They remained on a straight course until no longer visible.
