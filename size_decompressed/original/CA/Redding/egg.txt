3 egg like objects in the sky.;2008-04-21 15:00:00;4 mins.;3 egg like objects in the sky. Last night, in the early morning we were out walking around my home with friends. we were just walking our dogs and all of a sudden, we heard a  loud Swirling noise and our dogs went crazy. They ran far and were jumping at the sky. We looked up and there were 3 helicopter-like objects and had really strange designs om them. they started coming toward us and we ran back to the house. then this afternoon, we went to see if there was any evidence of it.  We went back and there was this strange spherical object with the same designs as the helicopters had.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
