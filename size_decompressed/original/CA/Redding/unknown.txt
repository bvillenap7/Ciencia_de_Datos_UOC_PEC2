A light above Redding, Ca;2000-08-17 03:00:00;03:30?;A light above Redding, Ca At 03:00hr on 08/17/00 I saw a light in the sky over Redding Ca. that was moving in an erratic fashion. The speed, direction, and movement changed at irregular intervals. The color of the light seemed to change from white to red. I tryed to report this to the local police, but they said that they couldn't see any thing. From the city of Redding you probably wouldn't be able to see it because of the city lights. I was in the foothills above Redding, not being affected by the city lights. ((NUFORC Note:  The report seems reminiscent of a twinkling star report, to us.  We do not know whether the witness means to state that it was visible for 3.5 hours, or 3.5 minutes.  We will check.  PD));40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Odd moving lights (multiples) seen on two seperate nights;2002-08-10 01:00:00;>1 hr;Odd moving lights (multiples) seen on two seperate nights While observing the current meteor shower, I noticed one light that at first I took to just be a star, however it was just slightly less dim that venus.  This light was moving in small cicles, then forward, then back, sometimes at a slow speed, then other times it would move rather quickly.  All three lights repeated the same pattern of behavior for over an hour.  The same lights appeared on 08/11/02 and again repeated the same odd behavior for a long time.  Those lights this time were preceded by a light coming from the north, that at first thought was just a high altitude jet.  But then it sped up to and incredible speed , turned 45 degrees to the east and moved off faster than anything I've ever seen (meteor speed).  That light was witnessed by just myself, but the other lights had two witnesses.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Burning object in Night Sky over Redding, CA 11/09/2007.;2007-11-09 22:45:00;4 minutes;Burning object in Night Sky over Redding, CA 11/09/2007 At 10:45PM My daughter an I were driving down our street.  As we neared our driveway, we noticed a neighbor of ours looking at something he saw up in the cloudy sky.  I saw it about 30 seconds before I noticed the neighbor looking at the light in the sky as I thought it was the Highway Patrol helicopter that had been flying around all evening.  The cloud deck was about 2500 feet as reported on the NOTAMS for our local airspace.  As my daughter and I got out of the car, we both looked up at the glowing object that was making NO sound.  We both noticed that it looked to be on fire as it floated southward at a very slow rate of speed.  The object got bright with flames, then almost appeared to be extinguished.  This repasted over 20 times.  The object slowly changed course to the North West direction as it started to fall apart, emitting sparks and flames as it disappeared into the clouds to the North West part of Redding, CA.  This object made NO noise and was moving very slowly between the ground and the cloud cover.  My wife and two daughters were witnesses to this which lasted 4 to 6 minutes.  Very strange as we were hoping it would be on the 11 O'clock news, but there were no other reports of the strange object in the sky?;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
I think I have seen sky wars over northern Calif.;2012-11-10 21:00:00;0.5 second;I think I have seen sky wars over northern Calif. Light beam shot out of a dark area twice in less than a sec.  in two different colors.  Example:  Hold a watch at arms length and picture a light beam shooting out to the 11 oclock and then 9 oclock postion and then the light beam just stopped at that point.   About two weeks later I saw the exact same thing except both beams were the same color.  I do wear glasses and considered this might have been a refelection, but this has not happened again in the 13 months.   P.S. I go outside for a smoke about once an hour and always watch the sky.

Orange glow moving randomly in the northern sky.;2014-03-26 00:15:00;2 minutes;Orange glow moving randomly in the northern sky. In the Northern sky, I witnessed an orange blob about 40 degrees above horizon.  It seemed to have a bit of size to it, not like a point like a star or airplane light. Weather, cloudy, intermittent rain. This means elevation was likely low, below or just at cloud level.  There was no beam of light as typical from airplane landing lights, rather it just glowed.  Brightness was about as bright as Venus at it's brightest, but was not as brilliant due to orange color. It moved at a very slow pace in a random pattern, almost like a leaf floating in a very very gentile breeze or bird gliding very slowly on a thermal.  Movements were too tight to have been a manned aircraft.  There was nothing consistent in its direction.  Very Random.   After a few minutes it started to move north very very slowly and just slowly faded out. Likely gained elevation and was covered by clouds. No sound accompanied the object and it seemed close enough that an aircraft would have been heard.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Bright light high in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Jupiter, which is quite prominent??  PD));2019-06-08 01:45:00;1-4 minutes;Bright light high in the sky. Went outside around 145am on  June 8th just to get some fresh air and I always look up to the sky when it's clear, and it was...I was looking  towards the North sky area and detected a large bright light in the sky...it looked  very high in the sky and was slow moving as though it was a helicopter but much too high for that and there was no sound...as I said the light was very bright and slowly moving in  what looked like a SE direction...the object then just disappeared and I could not see it any longer… It was a clear night...I thought later that maybe the ISS might have a Bright Light under it so people could see it pass over, don't know, maybe you might know...nothing else, but, will keep my eye to the sky.

300 plus ships in a sequential formation over California.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 22:00:00;30 minutes;300 plus ships in a sequential formation over California We 4 were outside smoking a cigarette, and we look up and see what appears to be a satellite. Then we realize that it is flying north in sequential order, and we watch at least 150+ go by in a straight line. They appeared to be at least 40,000 feet up. We saw a few more fleet go by after the few hundred steady stream, and these 20 or so quickly maneuvered from due north to south and south west directions. We were using binoculars and could see that it had two lights, one on each side of a darkened body. The final ship at the end of the fleet, shot off its rocket boosters and sped up incredulously. It was a fascinating, amazing, yet eerie as hell sight. We called a friend working out in Palo Cedro, about 30 minutes east of us, and this person could witness this event as well, and could see even clearer than us due to less light pollution and no tree lines. We were all wondering what the cause of this event was. WE guessed maybe 300 ships were seen total and e! ven more formations happening. Two people from our group have driven out somewhere with less lights to see if they can further witness any event happening. I dont usually believe in UFOs but i tried to google what i saw because we were all so stunned and it lead me to this site. We tried to take video but our phones couldn't capture this event even though you could clearly see this event happening with the naked eye. Something was preventing our binocs from fully focusing on the aircraft.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
20-30 single lighted flying objects flying steadily in linear formation.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-18 20:35:00;15;20-30 single lighted flying objects flying steadily in linear formation coming out of the west and heading eastward. We were outside finishing yard work due to the sun coming down and one of our 6 year old twins noticed a light flying overhead. My husband and I watched and didn’t see any flashing lights as we would normally see on airplanes. It had a steady white light. Then as that one kept flying we noticed another appeared behind it. Then another and another and another. Each flew in what looked like the exact same latitude longitude path of the preceding flying object. We could only see about 4-5 at one time in the sky before the next one came and the furthest out of view range heading eastward. They were flying with even space between them. We sat on the ground watching as more and more appeared out of the western sky. We attempted to take video on our iPhones but because it was so dark out it only showed black. We waited until the last one flew passed. I am estimating that it was between 20-30 flying objects. The shape was not clear as it was dark and they appeared t! o be high up and all we could make out was each individual light. No noise was heard.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
