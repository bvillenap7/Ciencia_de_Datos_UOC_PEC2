Rotating discs with colored lights seen ongoing for 3 weeks in July 2009 over N California;2009-07-05 01:00:00;03:00;Rotating discs with colored lights seen ongoing for 3 weeks in July 2009 over N California Beginning late in the first week of july, a number of brightly lit and multicolored discs were witnessed in the vicinity of Redding, California.  The discs were situated approximately 25-40 miles from the area of witness and clustered at the north and west coordinates in small groups, sometimes stacked on one another.  Near Mount Shasta and in the general vicinity of highway 5 is the most prominent location for these discs in the last 3 weeks.  They have also been seen due west over the rugged mountains of Trinity County at approximately the same distance away from the witnesses.  A rough estimation of the distance away is 25-40 miles and elevation above the ground is estimated at 10,000 to 25,000 feet.  All sightings have occurred right around 01:00 hours and most have persisted until 03:00 hours or later with the witnesses all having seen their fill by that time. It is the duration of constant hovering combined with the entirely unusual colored lights that! makes a very convincing argument the objects are not helicopters or airplanes. All four witnesses were satisfied with this conclusion and have agreed their is no normal explanation for what has been seen. In particular about the craft, they look to be rotating discs oriented horizontally or sometimes tilted at an angle of around 30 degrees. The discs emanate four flashing colors of bright light identified as green, orange, red and blue. The lights flash in a rotation around the perimeter of the discs in an obviously attention getting and unnatural display. The discs have been best described as Simon electronic games in the sky rotating. The Simon is a game that is still available and consists of four colored lights arranged around a circle that are hit in succession to form a pattern. Surely most people can recall one of these from a television ad at least and visualize the same four colors flashing around the edge of a disc hovering in the night sky. There are sometimes but not always accompanying craft but normally one flashes more brightly than the others or the others seem to hover near or above a main disc.  The discs do not make fast movements but have been seen to move drastically in the sky in a period of only 15 to 20 minutes.  Witnesses would see and identify the disc, then go indoors for a short while and come back out to see the disc had moved a hand's span in the sky in only a short time.  There has been reliably one disc in the northern sky near Mount Shasta and also similar discs in the western sky over Trinity County, a bit south of Whiskeytown reservoir.  One of the first sightings involved the disc in the northern sky moving in very small rapid circles side to side but maintaining the same altitude.  Almost like the tip of a pencil drawing small curly-Qs over and over in the same place.  This was much more pronounced than the usual shimmer of a star in the sky that results from the atmosphere refracting! the light. The discs were definitely making rapid circling movements while rotating their flashing lights constantly. These sightings are complete textbook UFO instances, lasting so long that one has plenty of time to view the object and make a very detailed observation.  These objects are definitely not standard aircraft and resemble nothing seen before by any of the four witnesses. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that stars would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witnesses had observed genuine UFO's.  PD));40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Soft orange glowing diamond shape with circular center;2009-09-18 21:15:00;8 Seconds;Soft orange glowing diamond shape with circular center I saw one object flying north to south at a high rate of speed, traveling in a straight line.  It was a soft orange glow, with a spherical center and conical tails or wings on each side.  The sphere was dark in the middle.  Seemed to have sort of a vibrational appearance.  It was completely silent.   First UFO I've ever seen.  I was pretty much a skeptic until tonight.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

One ship disk shape with symmetrical lights around it zoomed through sky in a and then disappeared.;2011-07-04 22:25:00;4 sec;One ship disk shape with symmetrical lights around it zoomed through sky in a and then disappeared. Laying down on my car i witnessed a UFO sighting.   The UFO was a disk shape barely visible, except for the lights surrounding it in a perfectly symmetrical fashion.   UFO came from an eastern direction traveling towards a western direction it traveled 3/4ths of the sky then vanished, took only 4-7 seconds to travel distance.   It traveled faster the any plane have ever seen and left no trail behind it.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
UFO appeared on live t.v. 10/8/2020;2020-10-08 17:06:00;2 seconds;UFO appeared on live t.v. 10/8/2020 I was watching tv as they were showing live video from a camera on top of a building in Redding,  CA, and I witnessed a saucer shaped object emerge from the area of the bottom of the screen and shot off to the right of the screen.  Movement of the object was extremely fast,  so I paused the live stream and rewatched it in slow-mo to get a better view. I took a picture of the screen that illustrates what I saw. I also replayed the video for my wife to see it as well.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
