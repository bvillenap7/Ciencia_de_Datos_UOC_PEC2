symentrical group of orange dots in night sky, no sound at all, no break in flowing formation at all;1990-08-23 18:45:00;3 to 5 minutes;symentrical group of orange dots in night sky, no sound at all, no break in flowing formation at all I was on my balcony when I looked up and saw what seemed to be many little orange dots moving upward in a flowing motion. I could see the shape shitfting smoothly like the tail of a jellyfish or a flock of birds. But the distance between the dots never shifted or broke pattern. There was total silence and steady movement. I could see the spaces between the dots clearly and as it got further away the dots got smaller. But the whole time it was totally silent and it was dark out but I could see each of the dots clearly. What caught my attention was the amount of dots and the flowing movement the group of dots made. It was not sharp movements but smooth flowing, rotating movetments.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Large orange shape changing object emits smaller orbs, winks out reappearing instantly in other locations;2009-07-06 23:33:00;3 minutes;Large orange shape changing object emits smaller orbs, winks out reappearing instantly in other locations Last night, here in Redding, California,  Monday 7-6-09, I took my two dogs out one last time before I headed off to work an ovenight shift.  It was about 11:33 PM. I looked up overhead and spotted a brilliant orange object, somewhat circular in shape.  It was about half the diameter of the holes punched in three-ring notebook paper held 30 from the eye. I estimated its altitude at 25K feet or higher.  From my position near the intersection of the Shasta View Drive and Tarmac Road, at 40*34'49N X 122*19'26W, the object appeared to be at 85 degrees above the horizon to the SSW.  Judging by its altitude, it was probably directly over the southwestern margins of the city limits of Redding, California. At first, its coloration was steady and unchanged the object was stationary.  But as I watched, it began to change shape, with several smaller orange objects coming from it, rapidly separating from the main object to a short distance then momentarily flashing and winking out, never to be seen again. This happened about  four different times. The main object would alternately appear as a circular shape then dim slightly from a bright orange color to a bright red and back again, and as it did so, it took on the appearance of multiple spheres clustered together very much like the oft-cited theodolite camera footage shot near Area 51 some years ago. But then the large object quickly winked out itself, going from bright orange to red, then to a brownish hue and vanished completely. It was completely out of sight for about a second and would suddenly flash and reappear in another location a short distance away, where it again stood motionless.  This on-off-on and sudden relocation event happened about six times.  Held at arm's length, these jumps would appear about three inches from point to point.  At an altitude of 25,000 feet altitude or more, this represents a jump of about a half mile or more, (transitioned instantly). I debated whether to run and grab my high-powered binoculars, but was afraid that the object would disappear before I could return to view the phenomenon.  The object moved in several directions in this disappear-reappear sequence and finally, as I was on my cell phone yelling for my girlfriend out in Palo Cedro to go out and look, it began moving in a south easterly direction and vanished just as she was just stepping outside. The sighting lasted about three minutes. I saw the International Space Station (ISS) pass overhead moving in a northeasterly direction about an hour earlier, so I know this was neither a sighting of nor mis-identification of that. After checking with the administration at the Redding Municipal Airport, I was told they have a recently installed ARTS-3C radar system that is slaved to the TRACON System at the Oakland Bay Airport, but they have no provisions for recording the returns locally.  I checked the internet for live radar feeds, but I guess there aren't any available to mere civilians.  Maybe it might be possible to find out if there is some ATC radar tapes that could be examined for a signature on this.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Changed shapes with bright multi-colored lights all over/around it.;2009-11-01 01:48:00;30-45 minutes;Changed shapes with bright multi-colored lights all over/around it. I first saw the object as I walked out on my porch to get some wood for my fire. It looked like a plane at first I thought it was just coming in to the airport, but then I noticed it wasn't moving and also it was flashing green, blue, red & white lights off and on, but in no particular pattern. I ran back inside and yelled for my friend Mary to come out and take a look and I grabbed a small pair of binoculars on the way back outside. I looked up and it was no longer a strip of flashing lights, but was now an oval shape with the same colored lights on and around it. They seemed to be twinkling instead of flashing now. I handed the binoculars to Mary and asked what she seen.( I didn't want her to be influenced by what I described, and also wanted to see if she could see anything at all.) She described the exact things I was seeing. It continued to hover there and I called several friends to get some one else to acknowledge this object, but no one answered. We then drove down to our local Shell gas station/convenience store to get the cashier to verify the sighting of this object. She hadn't used binoculars before and could not really get a good look at it she did state that her son had seen a UFO a couple days earlier, though. I called the local Police and the cashier called the Highway Patrol to see if anyone else had reported anything and they both said no.It was not in the sky when we got home and we did not see it leave, fly or disappear We called this number provided by the Redding Police Dept. and the recording gave us this web site address. The entire incident lasted approx. 40 minutes I am including sketches of what we saw, with descriptions and will email it ASAP.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Multiple red, white, and blue strobing lights in sky;2011-02-02 00:15:00;3 hours;Multiple red, white, and blue strobing lights in sky There were up to 6 of them. It started out with just 2, but more came throughout a 3 hour time span. They were star-like in shape that constantly fluttered red white and blue, like strobe light.  They moved around the entire sky, but not in any specific pattern.  Mostly, it was more of a gradual move, but a couple times one would bolt an inch across the sky.  Sometimes they would become really faint to where you could barely see it, other times they would get so huge and bright, and randomly one would disappear for a bit then reappear a couple inches from where it was.  They began to change form: One time it looked like a floating mass inside a lava lamp, another time it appeared in a saucer-like shape. I noticed one of them had a bright glowing orange center and one of them had white/yellow orbs revolving around a fluttering rainbow center. About 2 hours into it, 4-6 of them lined up horizontally. There was no mistake, it was a straight horizontal line. About 3! hours after it started, they ALL just disappeared.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Huge Multi-light array, pulsating lights, honeycomb array somewhat egg shapped.  Looks like a bright star, ((NUFORC Note:  Star?  PD));2018-12-07 00:00:00;10 hours;Huge Multi-light array, pulsating lights, honeycomb array somewhat egg shapped.  Naked eye looks like a bright star, Eastern Shasta County, directly east from Redding, California, towards Lassen Volcanic Park.   Bright star like object spotted in night sky for several months.  With Naked eye looks like very bright star.  With binoculars it actually is a many lights array configuration, shaped in a rather egg shape sphere, sort of like a huge honeycomb.  All Lights pulsate and are positioned precisely throughout the sphere, not just the edges.  The actual sphere appears to be static, not flying or moving.  Lights are sometimes all white, sometimes lights are red, blue, green, purplish, and white.  There is a larger light that goes around the outer rim of the configuration, seems to be pulsating-signaling. As of December we have noticed more than one of these, at least (3) nightly, light configurations hanging in space in the vicinity of the Lassen Mountain-Cascade range.  Time frame that they are seen is normally around 9:30 p.m. to around 7:30 a.m.  On Friday, December 6, 2018, one of the arrays emitted what looked like a mirror image of itself, and that mirror image pulsated-floated off towards the north.  Original configuration remained static in place. Anyone know what these light arrays are?  Could not get a photo with my Canon EOS 60D.  Sorry.  Thanks for the help in informing us what these might be.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

After than it took the shape of a cigar and there were many red lights on the bottom of it but it illuminated a white light from the front.  Again it did this 2 times switching from bright white ball to cigar shaped red then as it started to move south another  cigar shaped object with red lights conjoined with the white light from the first object, it went super huge bright white light and disappeared.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Objects seen with appearance of strange cloud.;2021-02-22 19:00:00;2 minutes;Objects seen with appearance of strange cloud. On February 23, 2021 my son and I were out on our back deck at about 7:00 p.m. (PST). We were looking to the north east and the sun had been down for about an hour or so. It was relatively clear out. The temperature was a comfortable sixty degrees. We wore light jackets.  We had been fooping around and my son looked up to the sky. He saw an odd looking cloud in the sky. He asked “is it just me, or does it look like something from another world just crashed?”. The cloud extended clear from the eastern horizon nearly to the western horizon. It was shaped like icing squeezed from a piping bag across a dark blue cake. We wanted to take pictures of the odd looking cloud so I got out my phone to take a picture. (Pictures sent to the email in the website).  Then, my son saw a bright object appear but did not see where it came from. Then my son saw the object make a straight path downward, then make a u-turn back up. I didn’t notice this while it occurred and while I was taking the photographs. My son also saw it change shape from a helicopter shape to a bright oval, and then speed away and appeared to change into a bird.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
