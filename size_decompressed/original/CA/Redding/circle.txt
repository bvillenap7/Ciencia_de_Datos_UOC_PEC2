I was there  for about a second then vanished with a vertical flash I had let my kit of Birmingham Rollers out to fly at around 4:30 pm, a predator had begun to chase them and they headed for higher skies(a normal thing when chased) They went up high, approx. 1500 feet, I couldn't see the color of the birds too well, so I brought out my bino's to view them better. They turned clock wise to the north and I spotted a metalic shinney object out the corner of my left eye.  I turned to look at the object and it was semi circle(kind of oval) it looked like a dule chrome and not a constant color, a hazziness to it.  It looked like a circle with a portion of it flat on one side.  It was there for about 1 full second+, not very long at all, then I see this weird flash of that was silverish in color but going vertical on the side of the objects flat side, followed with a small mirror type flash.  When the flash appeared the object was instantaniously gone, I pulled up the bino's and there was nothing at all up there but blue sky. The object appeared to be up as high as you see airliners cruising by, not sure though.  If it was up that high it would've been approximatley 3/4 the size of the airlines wing span. I was by myself but came into the house right after seeing it and told my wife about it, she said sacastically in a jokingly voice Did they abduct you too? I have never seen what I would call a UFO before and have been flying Birmingham Rollers most of my life and I'm 30 years old now. I went to work the next day and told an acquaintance there about it, he thought I was kidding for a second, then knew I was sure that I'd seen something.  He said his sister had called him a day earlier and said she'd seen a UFO, but didn't know any details of it. I'll send a diagram of what I saw in the mail;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
A circle moved quickly in a strait line.;2006-02-15 19:15:00;2 seconds;A circle moved quickly in a strait line. A flash of light moved across a small section of the SW sky.  It appeared and disappeared very quickly.  It moved in a striat line.  I thought it was a meteorite at first, but there was no trail.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Saw about 20 bright objects kind of like a swarm of bees, only they moved in jerks and zig zags;2006-08-20 13:30:00;5 min;Saw about 20 bright objects kind of like a swarm of bees, only they moved in jerks and zig zags Was a beautiful clear day, and decided to relax in the back yard.  Suddenly about 70 degrees up a red got shot out of the blue.  It kind of moved in an erratic motion.  Then it started to fade away as it went back up.  Suddenly another object appeared, and another.  Finally there were about 20 of them.  I tried to count them but it was difficult because of their pattern.  They make right hand turns or even reverse themselves without slowing down.  Sometimes they would suddenly be ahead of where they were going.  Wasn't sure they just appeared there or moved so fast I couldn't see it - kind of like the snap of a rubber band. They kept coming closer and after a few minutes started to move away.  One kind of hung back, and as the others faded away, it shot to the north west at an incredible speed.  This may sound strange, but it left a hole in the atmosphere.  You could make it out for a few minutes. Best I can say for color, it's kind of like looking at a 100 watt light bulb on a bright sunny day.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Round ball of light type object floating silentley over the trees around the river.;2010-02-14 22:20:00;7 minutes;Round ball of light type object floating silently over the trees around the river. I shot this video in my back yard on Feb 14, 2010, at aprox. 10:20pm in Redding, Ca, USA.  I have no idea what this thing is but I saw one about 4 nights ago and tried to get a video but it left to soon.  This video starts out a little shaky and blurry but it gets better.  I think i got some pretty clear shots of whatever it was.  Anyway, please excuse my language, as I was kind of excited when i shot the video, and i bruised my shin tripping over a stump and got poked in the face with a stick while i was trying to film.  I guess this makes me an official UFO chaser. LOL :)   BTW, did anyone else living in Redding see this?    Video URL:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGMocn_26c  I still have the original digital video if anyone is interested.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

I was walking my dog at the park when I saw this unsual sunbeam above the cumulus cloud. So, I took several photos and a video of it.  When I checked the video the next day, I couldn't believe what I saw. Not one, but four UFOs can be seen within the the First 13 Seconds of the footage. They are very small and translucent, flying close to the clouds. You'll need to repeatedly play then rewind the first 13 seconds of the footage to clearly see them. The first three moves linearly while the fourth moves haphazardly. UFO #2 and #4 seems to originate behind the clouds. Study the still photo showing the sequence and trajectory of each ufo first here:  <a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4785400959_df24566447_b.jpg rel=nofollow>farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4785400959_df24566447_b.jpg</a> Then review this video again.

Orange obect in sky;2012-05-13 22:15:00;4 minutes;Orange obect in sky Last night (May 13) between 10:15 and 10:20 p.m. my son yelled for me to come into the backyard. There was an orange circular object in the sky and it appeared to be quite large.  It travelled from the east to the northwest, and as it travelled it rapidly became visually smaller.  As it travelled, at one point it dipped down, went east for a moment, then went back to travelling towards the northwest.  The size at first from the ground looking up was between dime and nickel sized  (Far too large to be a satellite, planet or star) and reduced to a mere pinpoint of orange light, then we could not see it anymore.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Three persons see bright lights flying over Redding, California.;2012-09-15 13:00:00;5 minutes;Three persons see bright lights flying over Redding, California. My son came into my room and told me to get out of bed and come look at the light in the sky. At which time I did. As we was walking he started telling me to hury before I missed it. After going out the front door he had me follow him up to the street in front of are drive way which faces the north were we met up with his friend. At this time they directed me to look up and in a southern direction. It was summer time and quite clear outside lots of stars shining. There in the sky looking like a star to fare away to see any structure was a flying object very much looking like a star but much brighter. While it was flying you could clearly see the stars disappear beyond it.  But it was very high much higher then local aircraft fly.this flying object was flying in a darting back and forth manner or away and closer in a small tight area and at times would just stay still. at the end of the sighting the object at such a fantastic speed it went up in a direction towards the stars to the point which it disappeared. I my self am not a pilot.  I will say I have studied aircraft most my life and I know that the government has aircraft many years ahead of what we get to see. I know of no such aircraff that can fly in that maner also I know of no way a pilot could with stand that kinds of force and survive or how any aircraft could even stay together. The way this lighted object moved looked to be controled and very very fast. I know of no air craft that can exel to such a high speed and without stoping or turning suddenly change direction back to the direction from which it was going.  I never seen a structure and at any time nor did any sound come from the object. I told my son and his friend this event was somthing special. i just wanted to keep this are experience as are own and also not to be labels as some kind of nut. I found out about this site through a TV documentary and decided to shair it I would like to add durring the objects up and down motion a few times it looked as though it was coming closer to us and grew larger In that direction I could see it traveled many many miles and then back up to it original point and it could do this at lightening speeds. Like the blink of a eye. My mother told me of a flying object over her village on the island of trinadad south america She was 12 years of age. She was born in 1919 and has since passed away. Let me know if you would like to here it.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

At least 50 percent of my training was spent studying the size, shape and characteristics of over 400 worldwide aircraft.  Both foreign and domestic. Military, and civilian. I was Discharged “Honorably” as a Non commissioned officer. Because of my background, I’ve lived life with my eyes trained on the sky. Approximately two months ago while walking from my house to my vehicle. I looked up briefly and scanned the sky. Taking pause for a moment on a section between a cloud formation, and at A 20- 25,000ft range slightly southwest of my position. I immediately spotted a single black dot with absolutely no identifiable characteristics. Clearly this wasn’t any conventional aircraft I’m am familiar with. This dot caught my attention as it moved out from the cloud for 2 seconds, and then reversing course immediately going back into the cloud. The object continued with this behavior 3 times before a second object of the same size and shape followed it into the adjacent cloud formation. These radical movements simply could not have been accomplished by any aircraft I’m familiar with. The speed with which they moved at that altitude was astonishing. I honestly never thought I would see anything in the sky that I was unable to explain to some digress. I did however. I believe my military background, and experience Lends a great deal of credibility to my opinion.  Northern California;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite serious, and very sober-minded in his description of what he and two of his children had seen.
