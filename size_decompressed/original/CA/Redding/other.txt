I saw a very bright green ball fall from the sky , then disappear over the horizen.;1999-02-02 06:43:00;1 full second;I saw a very bright green ball fall from the sky , then disappear over the horizen. This morning at about 6:45AM, I was driving southeast on Bueneventura Blv..  I was noticeing how beautiful the sunrise was, as it was just getting light over the horizen in front of me.  Then I saw a very bright green ball shaped object fall from the sky, disappearing over the horizen.  This seemed to occur just as the sun was coming up. The sky was just beginning to lighten up pink in color and I could also see the horizen of mountains, however the sky was still dark behind me.  There were a few clouds above me, but none where I saw this object.  This object was a very bright florescent green.  I'm not sure how far away it was, but the mountains it fell behind are at least 60 or 70 miles away.  It was about twice the size of the lit part of a streetlight. It didn't appear to have a tail.                                                                                                                                                                                         I am a homemaker with 2 children.  I've done extensive traveling worldwide and also I've had the opportunity to fly various places since my childhood.  I've worked as a secretary for my father's firm.  His work is heavy construction.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
large, boomerang shaped craft....no lights, completely black...no noise..flew over us...north to south direction(approx.)..very fast;1999-11-18 03:20:00;15-30 seconds;large, boomerang shaped craft....no lights, completely black...no noise..flew over us...north to south direction(approx.)..very fast While laying on my roof watching the meteor shower, my friend and I noticed a large, boomerang shaped object flying at a high rate of speed directly over Redding, CA.  This object was large, completely black...no lights of any kind showed, and made no noise.  The craft never strayed from its single course, and disappeared in the horizon when the city lights were too bright for us to see it anymore.  It came from the north...flying south...maybe southwest.  The whole experience lasted no longer than 30 seconds from the initial sighting to losing track of the object.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
2/3 of night sky filled with purple-pink light criss-crossing each other like a NET at Redding, CA;2005-07-17 05:03:00;45 minutes;2/3 of night sky filled with purple-pink light criss-crossing each other like a NET at Redding, CA In Redding, California near the Sacramento River looking WEST (with Mt. Lassen at my back), about 5 A.M. every other morning for this past week, {with this morning being the 3rd sighting}.... I see something that fills 2/3 of the night sky. It looks like  brilliant purple/pink lights criss-crossing each other and looks like a purple-pink NET.  As it is summer time {July 2005} and 100 plus degrees, I have been sleeping outside under the stars. Last night I set my alarm so that I could see just what time this event actually started.  Not at 2 A.m, not at 3 A.m., not at 4 A.M.  Each time my Dog wakes me up when this strange event starts.   It was there at about 5 A.M. this morning and continued even after daylight.... only the color was no longer there and the criss-crosses looked like white smoke.  If anyone knows what I am seeing, would you please contact Peter so that he can contact me and let me know... thanks;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

Dark, V-shaped figure with 7 lights seen above Redding, CA through thin clouds, making drastic movements.;2010-12-29 01:45:00;<20 seconds;Dark, V-shaped figure with 7 lights seen above Redding, CA through thin clouds, making drastic movements. On December 29, 2010, I witnessed a dark V-shaped object flying above thin cloud cover in Redding, there were 7 lights in total, 3 on each side of the V and one at the very point. It was flying south, made an instant change to the west for a few seconds, then shifted back southward. There we geese flying nearby and I’ve never heard a more panicked group of them in my life, let alone at almost 2 a.m.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
Second time seeing same craft. Have pictures/ video of craft shape. Very near airport. Bright multicolored light. Left as dawn arrived.;2017-06-10 05:00:00;30 minutes;Second time seeing same craft.  Have pictures/video of craft shape.  Very near airport. Bright multicolored light.  Left as dawn arrived. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at a twinkling star, or perhaps a planet.  The still photo, which was forwarded by the source of the report, indicates a tiny, blurry object, seen against a dark nighttime sky.  We are unable to certify that it is an authentic UFO.
