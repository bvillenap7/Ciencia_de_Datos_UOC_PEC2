The A.T.C. said it was a type of U.S. Military craft I can't remember. C.A.P. confirmed.Next summer pix of same craft in paper didn't look AT ALL LIKE CRAFT I DESCRIBED TO THEM!!The A.T.C. said we live in a blind radar area, by the way.I feel this is the new stealth, but who knows?  COMPLETELY SILENT AND COULD HOVER SILENTLY? I worked at Stanford University Hospital for 22 years.Ten of those years were in Administration and the rest were as a Ward Clerk on various nursing units.I am now retired.I am 52 years old and am female. My son, now 15 and my daughter, now 17 both saw it.My daughter came running in on a clear,cold February night yelling to me that there was a UFO hovering very low over our private road.She was pretty shook up.  By the time I got there,it had gone on.However,I went outside and check the sky.Lo and behold,I saw this very large craft shaped like a stingray fish without a tail flying very low in an oval pattern.The craft appeared to be in a training mode,because the pattern never varied.The craft slowly flew the same pattern for about 30 minutes.Our house was located just before the craft turned to the left (east),and was flying so close to our 2nd story deck I could have hit it with a rock!There were norunninglights.  The entire underneath had what looked like very large glass bricks.They were so bright,it was difficult to look at them for any length of time. There was a HUGE bubble where a cockpit would be.It was VERY tall and narrow (that's the only way I can describe it).Color was either grey or green.There were no windows apparent.I think I saw a tail fin, but I might be mistaken.It was dark.My daughter, however says she didn't see a tail fin. Unfortunately, I didn't own a video camera or any kind of camera at the time to record this incident.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

I looked up and SE while getting into the car. I saw an object with two red lights and one green light.  These lights were not flashing.  It was traveling NE paralell to Interstate 5.  It passed overhead.  While viewing it I could see no stars between the lights. Only a large dark triangular shape.  I drove my car NE to a friends home and continued to view the object traveling slowly over Redding.  It veried West toward Mt Bally or Baldy.  At my fiends home it was still visable. She and her neighbors came out and viewed it with binoculars. Our internet services also locked up at about the same time. I could not get on the internet for over two hrs.  It was 8:24PM PST when it went over me.  It was larger then the full moon. I heard no sound from the object. As it went west I saw an amber light or glow also. At no time did any lights blink. I'm a Genealogical Researcher and homemaker.  I have raised five children and been married 39 years.  I have some laymans knowledge of some of the constellations. I also do some research for Historical Projects.  My friend is a Pharmacy assistant and her husband is retired. I don't know the back ground of her neighbors.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

The object was white in color and was moving in such a trajectory that it would strike the ground within several miles of where I was.  There were a couple of other large trucks on the freeway who had to have seen the same thing that i did, as it was very hard to miss.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
