Hovering/slow moving shiny object.;2012-06-28 12:00:00;5 to 10 minutes;Hovering/slow moving shiny object. Hovering shiny object above town in the middle of the day. It was either hovering or possibly moving at a very slow speed. It gave off what looked like a flickering or irregular blinking light that may have been a reflection from the sun. We watched it for about 5 minutes, before we passed under some trees and couldn't see it anymore after that. I don't know if it disappeared or if it just moved to an angle where it could no longer be seen by us. Never seen anything like that before.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
