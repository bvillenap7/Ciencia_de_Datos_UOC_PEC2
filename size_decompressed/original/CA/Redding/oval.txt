A local plane pilot reported seeing a blue light flash past his plane. It was in an evening of 1990 or 1991, but I am inclined to think 1990.  I don't remember the month or day.   One evening me and a friend were talking on the driveway of my house, and we noticed a red pulsating orb floating in one place near the airport, which was a few miles from where I lived.  It was not making a sound or moving.   We jumped into my car in order to get a closer look.  As we approached the area, we observed the object was gone.   A UFO siting by an airplane pilot was reported that same evening in our local news, and the next morning in the local newspaper.    The Pilot said he had seen a blue light shoot past his airplane while in flight.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
was watching kit of pigeons fly, saw out the corner of eye, noticed it and it was gone within a couple of seconds;1998-10-26 17:00:00;a second or two;was watching kit of pigeons fly, saw out the corner of eye, noticed it and it was gone within a couple of seconds I had put my kit of birmingham roller pigeons out at about 4:30 pm, they were getting chased around by a hawk and decided to go up fairly high, normal when predators chase them.  I wanted to watch them as they were rolling around but I couldn't see the colors very were, up about 1500 feet I'd guess.  I put down the bino's as it was hard to follow them, sore neck. They turned and went northern flying in a counter clockwise turn.  I saw a shinney object out the corner of my left eye.  I turned to look and it was a semi oval object just sitting there, not moving.  It was like a dule chrome color, but kind of hazy like when you see a jet airline flying by. It might have looked hazy from the reflectivness of the object but not sure? It was only there for a little over a full second then a bright silverish vertical flash appeared(reminded me of something like on star trek, when they transport), followed by a flash similar to a mirror flash and it was just gone. I pulled up my bino's to see if I could see anything in the vicinity and there was absolutely nothing. the object like I said was kind a oval, but more like a circle with one flattened side to it, the flash appeared from this flattened side while it vanished. a guy I work with said his sister had seen a UFO the day before i did, this was after I had mentioned to him that I had seen one that he said his sister had mentioned to him a day earlier that she'd seen one.  I haven't learned the details of her sighting yet. That's it.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
White light, rotating blue lights on it in the night sky Redding Ca;2012-01-26 19:20:00;20-30 seconds;White light, rotating blue lights on it in the night sky Redding Ca Submitted:  January 27th, 2012, at 8:00 p.m. On the evening of January 26th, 2012 at approximately 7:20 p.m.while driving home from work, I observed a bright white light in the night sky to my left side as I drove up a local street. I was heading up Highway 273 north up what is called North Market Street or to locals Miracle Mile, in Redding, California. As I got approximately 2/3 of the way up the hill, I caught sight of a large white object to my left, or the western side of the road.  It appeared to be of an oval shape, well above the tree lines and had rotating blue lights around it, resembling a carnival ride.  It was heading in the same direction I was, north, and as it got above the buildings at the top of the hill, it seemed to make an immediate sharp right turn.  I was almost at the top of the street when this occurred, and as it made the right turn it seemed at accelerate, then suddenly it was gone. I have served in many countries while in the military, and ridden in many types of military helicopters and airplanes, but nothing  I have ever seen resembled this.  The way it disappeared as it accelerated was what caught my eye, as the night was clear and I had an un-obstructed view of the dark where I had seen the whatever it was. I have been inside burning aircraft to remove dead bodies, have seen many things in my life which were amazing and extremely curious, but I have to say that this was without a doubt one of the scariest things I have every witnessed.  I felt more fear on the rest of my drive home than I can ever recall feeling, and even tonight while driving home the same route at the same time I felt a chill as I drove up Miracle Mile. I cannot for sure state how big the object was, but if I had to make a guess, I would say it was maybe 20-30 feet, basing this on roughly how high it was in the sky and in relation to the traffic lights at the top of Miracle Mile. Thank you for taking the time to read this   Sincerely, ((name deleted)) Redding, Ca ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally well-spoken and objective in his description of the event.  Witness is medical professional.  We suspect the source of report is exceptionally capable as a witness.  PD));40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731
