A HUGE WHITE/BLUEISH FIREBALL WAS SEEN AT ABOUT 400-600 FEET ABOVE GROUND AND WE FOLLOWED IT BELOW THE TREE LINE As I was driving my brother and I to work, southbound on Interstate 5, we saw a very large fireball to the south east shooting straight down in to ground.  It was very weird to see.  It started out like a small flash then as the flash stretched out downward a fire ball was forming.  I'd say it looked like 400-600 feet up when we noticed it and appeared to be about 3/4 of a mile away. It feel very slow in comparison to a meteor and appeared to look like an airplane falling out of the sky and burning, it fell that slow. It was close enough that I could see the boiling of the flames off of the fireball.  We tried to gauge the distance and size in comparisons to cars or trucks on the highway as we continued to work.  It was much bigger then a semi truck coming at you at around 3/4 mile away.  It was similar to a meteor color of white with a blueish tenge to it.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

While driving west on sacramento road I ovberserved a momentary flash followed by a ball of fire, This event had startled me to the point where I needed to pull my car over and take a second to register what I had seen. At the time I stepped out of my car I noticed a woman and a man in another car pointing to the sky apearently they had scene the object/ event as well, I asked them if they'd scene the event, and both looked startled by this then climbed into their car and quickly left the scene, I sat there for a moment looking for anyone else who might have whitnessed the even and then left, ending the experience.

Orange Fireballs in the northern sky over Redding;2012-01-17 18:45:00;5 minutes;Orange Fireballs in the northern sky over Redding Saw 2 bright orange/reddish fireballs come from the north sky. They zig zagged a bit and moved real slow with no sound for about 3 minutes.  After they got what seemed to be fairly close, they just hovered in the air for a couple minutes and then they slowly faded out until they couldn't be seen any more.  People driving by stopped their car in the middle of the road and got out and were asking what it was.  My fiance and I are in awe right now.;40.5631770234984;-122.386166840731

Green  fireball outlives its tail!  ((anonymous report))  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2018-08-30 20:20:00;3 seconds;Green  fireball outlives its tail ! My wife and I live in Redding Ca. On Wednesday evening, Aug. 30, 2018, at apprx. 8:20 PM , (still daylight ) , we were in our car going to town. We were driving north on a suburban road, when straight ahead in our windshield we both saw at the same time, a bright green fire ball with a burning orange color tail. It was traveling  from east to west from an elevation of about 35 degrees, down to about 10 degrees.  When it was about two thirds  of the way in its trajectory, the tail went out but the bright green ball continued on for about one second.  The total duration of the sighting was about 3 seconds. This is the fourth thing like this I have seen over a period of about 20 years, all in California. The other three flared and burned up and looked to be gone, unlike this one that kept going after the tail was gone. Seemed kind of unusual to me.
