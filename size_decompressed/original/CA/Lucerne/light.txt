I remarked to my friend that the scene looked like a card, and he looked and saw what I saw.   Then I turned away for a second, looked out the door again, and saw the star move above the slope and over the ridge. My friend and I saw it once, and then it was gone!

At around 11:30 PM, I noticed a star blinking strangely in the night sky through my window. It appeared almost the same as an average star, however, there is substantial cloud cover tonight and I noticed slight changes in hue when the thing blinked. I continued watching, reporting to some friends over text at 11:53 PM (hence the timestamp.) I left for a few moments, and the star was gone. I stared at the sky some more just to be totally certain, and saw the object streak relatively slowly across the sky. I see relatively similar things on a regular basis, so I thought I'd report it.;39.0767;-122.7873
