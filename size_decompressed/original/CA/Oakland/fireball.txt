While exiting on Grand Ave. from 580E, I witnessed a silver fireball suddenly appear in the sky above and straight ahead of me, approx. 50-100 away.  It fell very rapidly in a slight arc, then it plainly shot away, ahead of me, and disappeared.   For that fraction of a second that it shot away, it became smaller in size before disappearing.   The fireball effect was impressive enough, but I wouldn't have thought it nearly so odd had I not seen that effect of an actual object traveling away from me. I was coming home from my work as a veterinary nurse.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117

I saw the chem trail from east heading west towards the Pacific Ocean.  Far above the vapor was a rocket like craft thousands of feet up.  It went at a 45 degree angle towards the west above the bay area from the east heading west towards the pacific ocean. the bell shaped vapor was huge and smaller vapors were above it. when I saw it, I did not see the bright light.  he thought it was a helicopter at first with a search light.  But, when I looked, it clearly seemed more like a rocket going up into the atmosphere and he agreed with me at that point in time that that is what it looked like.  We don't have a camera or iPhone to photograph it. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy ICBM launch.  PD));37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
