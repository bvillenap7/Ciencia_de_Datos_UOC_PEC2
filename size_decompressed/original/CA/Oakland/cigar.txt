White cigar shaped above Oakland airport;2013-07-29 17:00:00;20 seconds;White cigar shaped above Oakland airport Around 5pm on Monday July 27th, 2013 I looked out my window and saw a very slow moving white cigar shaped object in the sky.  I am in Oakland, close to Lake Merritt, the object was East of me, almost above Oakland airport, going North.  It did not seem to glow or anything, it was simply white against the grey background of the clouds.   At first I thought it was an elongated blimp of some sort, as it seemed larger than a plane, but flying way too slow to be a plane.  Then it sort of shrunk itself from end to end to the point of disappearing in a matter of 5 seconds, tops.  The whole event lasted 20 to 30 seconds.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
Cigar shaped ufo seen falling to earth ion Oakland.;2015-01-08 07:15:00;4 minutes;Cigar shaped ufo seen falling to earth ion Oakland it was 1/8/15 at 0715 hrs in the morning.  I was having a cigarette scanning the sky looking in the eastern sky. I saw something at about 45 degree in the falling towards earth at a very sharp angle, like if it was the hands of a clock, it would be facing seven o clock. It was traveling incredibly slow.  So slow, that I didn't know whether this was a contrail from an earlier plane or whether it was moving.  I had to use the telephone wire as a reference marker to make sure it was moving.   Once I realized it wasn't a contrail, a plane flew near it, on its own trajectory, giving me an immediate reference to the movement of planes.  As it started falling past the tree limbs it did something really funny.  It seemed to have compressed, almost like an accordion into itself and seemed just hover in the sky.  Watching this sent chills down my spine because it's movement was one I have never encountered in my life.  It wasn't a meteor because the speed was too slow.  Nothing could just fall from the sky at the rate it was falling.  The velocity was just too slow.   And it wasn't a plane.  I took a video, buts it's poor in quality, but I did take a few photos that didn't turn out so badly.  Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in seeing them.
