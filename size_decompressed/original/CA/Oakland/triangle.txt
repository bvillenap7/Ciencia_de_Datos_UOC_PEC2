At first I thought it was a little strange and almost as soon as I finished the thought I noticed a black shape (Triangular) moving through the sky. The sky was clear of clouds that night so that is why I didn't see this object at first, plus the fact that the object seemed to make no noise. At first I wasn't really comprehending what I was seeing. As soon as I realized what it was I froze. I wanted to go get one of my other family members but for some reason I was unable to do anything more then to stare at it as it fly slowly overhead at about 700 to 1,000 ft. The  strangest thing about the object was that it was moving so slowly. If I had to guess the object's speed, I'd say it was moving at about 50 to 75 mph(North to South). It was so black that if I hadn't noticed the stars dissapearing and reappearing then I probably would of never of noticed it. One more thing. This might sound stupid but the object appeared to have a circular window on the bottom side of it with light coming out of it.I didn't observe any type of activity in the window(if that was in fact a window and that was the bottom side of the object).Maybe it was a light on the bottom but it didn't seem to be.Until that night I never really believed if unexplained flying objects and while my knowledge may be limited in the area of terrestial flying objects I am sure that what I witnessed that night was an object that I can't explained and my thoughts sometimes go back to that night. I also believe that I witnessed see the same object one more time in march of 1998 after I returned to my home in Long Beach, Ca that event was so fast that it lasted less then 10 seconds. I caught a glimpse of it between some buildings when an object passed between the moon and me casting a shadow on me.I looked up because I didn't hear the helicopter that the police use flying over hear and there it was again.I have never seen the object again. I also cannot explain why I froze in place the first time I saw the object.All my senses were screaming at me to go get someone but I just stood there in utter amazment and shock. Go figure.

I wasn't sure what I was looking at so I asked my friends, what's that? My one frined looked up and saw it too.  It was triangular shaped flying object with 5 amber lights, (four of the lights were on what appeared to be the bottom and one light was on the top). The object was as dark as the night sky and it was moving fast without any sound. It eventually just disappered in the distance.  I have never seen anything like it before in my life and neither has my frined.  I ran home after dinner, went online and found this website.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
Three transluscent, reddish-colored, orbs in a perfect triangular pattern fly overhead at a constant speed.;2010-01-30 19:00:00;5-10 sec;Three transluscent, reddish-colored, orbs in a perfect triangular pattern fly overhead at a constant speed. This day, January 30, 2010 at approximately 19:00 hours, I as well as two others were witness to a UFO flying overhead. At the base of the Oakland Hills, myself as well as three other friends, were on the outdoor deck of a penthouse on the fourth floor of an apartment building. Our focus was on the horizon just over the hills due to the reason that a friend mentioned that the moon rises so quickly at night over the hill. While we were waiting as we observed the glow of the moon thru the fog rolling over the hill, two of the three friends went into the house (the residents of the apartment.) I remained outside because at 25 years of age I had never witnessed the moonrise before. While the other and myself were anxiously waiting for the moon to peak over the hill he shouted, “ A UFO, a UFO!!!” I immediately looked to where he was pointing and I saw a triangle shaped object. It was three translucent reddish-colored orbs in a symmetrical “pyramid” shape. The top! of the triangle, the point, was at the head of the direction it was moving. It was moving at a higher rate of speed at an altitude higher than that of planes that regularly fly over the same area. Its rate of speed during the sighting never wavered. It remained at a constant speed throughout the sighting. At the time it was in our field of view, there was not one other plane or object in the sky. The only things in the sky in view were the stars. When he shouted, the male resident of the apartment raced out to the deck (back patio) and immediately saw the UFO. He was the only one who said he “heard” it. Myself as well as the other fellow who first observed the object did not hear anything. It was just “gliding” thru the sky. I have never seen anything like it. It was funny or odd to me that several minutes after the sighting, as we were all in amazement of what we had just observed, I noticed the sky began to fill up with airplanes flying overhead. This was odd to me due to the fact that when the UFO was in the sky there were no other objects present except the sky and stars. Several seconds soon after the UFO traveled out of our field of view, is when planes began to fly in their respective patterns overhead.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
Triangle of lights speeding accross the sky from Oakland, CA;2010-04-09 01:14:00;4-6 seconds;Triangle of lights speeding accross the sky from Oakland, CA I went outside for a smoke at around 1:10 AM this morning. I was looking at the stars facing southwest, when something caught my eye. I quickly looked over and in 1-2 seconds I saw 4 lights moving at an incredible speed past the roof of my house. I quickly ran around to the side of the house to see what it was. For the next 2-4 seconds I clearly saw 3 lights forming a triangle speeding across the sky directly south. There was also a light right in the middle of all 3. There was a large distance between the lights, because at the speed they were moving, they stayed in perfect unison probably 5-6 miles apart from each other. I'm not sure whether or not these were rim lights to some large craft, but it seems unlikely since the distance between them stayed in a perfect triangle. If this is the case, the craft must have been absolutely huge. The speed of this object was approximately (and I'm guessing here) 10-15x faster than the airplanes I observed in the sky over the SF Bay Area during the minutes after the sighting. I can't stress enough that this thing was moving INCREDIBLY FAST!  The night sky during the event was very hazy, with the lights from San Francisco making it hard to see the stars. I lost sight of the object in the haze traveling southward. The lights also appeared to be speeding up. For the past year, I lived outside the city, and saw many shooting stars during the night and early morning. I am absolutely certain that these lights were not shooting stars. I hope this report is of use to someone. Cheers -((name deleted));37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117

Triangular black object with red lights seen over Alameda;2013-12-22 01:00:00;2 minutes;Triangular black object with red lights seen over Alameda A very large, black triangular craft with red lights on its perimeter, was seen maneuvering west of my home at 13th Avenue and 20th street, in the direction of Alameda or the Bay.  (Monitoring the weapons cache at the old Naval Air Station?)  I estimate it was 1/2 mile above the ground and maybe 2 miles away.  It had 3 sides, with red lights. Last night was crystal clear, yet this object appeared blurry. It made sharp and quick turns.  My intuition leads me to believe they were looking for someone or something. I continued to watch, covered in goose bumps, for approximately 2 minutes. Both of my dogs were frightened.  The smaller dog wanted me to pick her up.  My other dog wanted nothing more than to just go home.  They have never shown fear to a vehicle, especially a vehicle in the sky. It's ascent left me feeling it is not ours.  As it took off skyward, it  did so keeping the hull square to the ground, travelling virtually in a direct vertical line.  Its color also changed to an orange color.  This craft was completely silent.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
