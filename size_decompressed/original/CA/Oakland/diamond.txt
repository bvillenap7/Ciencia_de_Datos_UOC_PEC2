I was getting ready to go to the store and I was looking at the sky cuz you was very clear that night and I just so happen to see a shooting star and I was wowed I've never seen a shooting star before I think I'm seeing things move but not anything that close-up I actually saw it fits out or whatever that close to me and then shortly after that I'm looking up and I see something that appears to be a star but it's moving across the sky like it was almost like a shooting star happen and then directly from the place where a phased out as I'm looking into something that appears to be like a star and going across the sky in about 2-3 minutes I watched it go all the way towards Emeryville and the sky was it passed under stars and it look just like a star but starts don't move that way so it's been kind of messing with me for a couple of days it's very playing over and over my head so I thought that I was just say something about it;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
