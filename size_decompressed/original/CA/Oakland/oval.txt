lights moving in the sky 7 landing in Oakland over coliseum & airport;2002-10-01 03:00:00;07:00;lights moving in the sky 7 landing in Oakland over coliseum & airport blinking light emitting red/purple/gree/white at different times.  At first it was one then I saw another one that was bright white at first begin to move and change colors.  This has been occuring every night since that original night moving into the 7th night. The first night when we were watching it, my cell phone rang at 5:00am when I answered it, a very loud beeping noise came out of it.  On Friday 10/04/02 we actually saw the lights come all the way down & land and this time there was about 20 moving throughout the sky and about 10 that landed. It was actually pretty frightening, becauause we had been studying them & their movement, seeing them land was a bit too close for comfort. An interesting thing is that we saw them land inside the Oakland Coliseum & the Oakland airport.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
30 small round objects floating horizontally in circular formation;2007-07-27 12:30:00;5 minutes;30 small round objects floating horizontally in circular formation Driving North on I-580 near to the Oakland Zoo.  My mom pointed out a weird bird formation in front of us.  She thought it looked strange because they were all staying together almost in a circular form and we both thought that birds usually don't fly like that together.  As we got closer, we thought it was balloons because of the way they moved up and down, but the strange thing was if they were balloons they didn't go up into the air.  The stayed within the circular pattern and seemed to hover or float horizontally.  Of course neither of us had a camera. I verbally explained it to my dad and he said it may have been a bunch of balloons all tied together which is what it almost looked like...but what are the odds of 30 balloons staying together and not floating straight up into the air.  I am writing this because we were on the freeway and the UFO was very visible and not too high above us.  Someone else had to see it!!;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
I saw a helicopter-size and silent object with a belt of lights rotating around it hovering over a park at night.;2008-04-21 22:00:00;2 minutes;I saw a helicopter-size and silent object with a belt of lights rotating around it hovering over a park at night. I was walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the street heading west on 34th street from Telegraph Ave towards Martin Luther King Junior Blvd. I was passing a small park and noticed flashes of light. I turned and saw a dark object as big as a helicopter hovering over the park. It was silent and less than a quarter of a mile up in the sky. There was this belt of tiny irregular-flashing lights that would move around this big, dark oval object.  The UFO started to go higher in the sky and it moved slowly back and forth like how you could swing a pendulum.  It was now about half a mile in the sky and gradually started to move North-East towards Berkeley. Never have I seen something like this before. It was shocking, and I want to know if anybody else saw it. Iâ€™m glad I found this website to share this sighting of a UFO which I always thought was as a funny thing until this past Monday night, it is now certainly no joke to me.  I am into astrology and astronomy, so I look into the sky a lot at night. The most amazing things I have seen are meteor showers, but now this is the top of the list.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117

I was facing the sith western sky when this happened.   It floated for a few seconds which made me think it was some sort of helicopter, with the sun reflecting a bright orange reflection off it.   When it started moving up down left and right with ease and fluidity, I knee it could not be eirg.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
