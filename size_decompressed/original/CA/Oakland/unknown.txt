First Friday Oakland, CA UFO sighting;2010-05-07 21:00:00;5 sec.;First Friday Oakland, CA UFO sighting Saw 5 orange lights in a rectangular pattern with one in the center.  It was moving in a SE direction, very slowly and made no sound.  Then it quickly took off and disappeared.  It was only what seemed to be about 5 stories above us and about the size of a large car. I normally would not report these sightings but my brother who was standing next to me saw the same exact thing as well as a few other people.  We were in a crowded place for 1st Friday in Oakland and was amazed that with all these people only a handful of us saw this thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Orange lights ORB silent and odd movement with VIDEO.;2014-02-21 23:46:00;2 minutes;Orange lights ORB silent and odd movement with VIDEO I witnessed a very bright orange light appear into the sky.  The light changed from bright to dark orange almost in a pulsating fashion.  Its movement was silent and gracefulty made its way across the night sky at times slowing and moving faster.  I was having a smoke on my balcony as i always do around this time of night.   As fast as I could I grabbed my smartphone to try and capture a video. its not the best video but its what i saw and its un-edited.  This ORB was in the sky  It was in the sky about 75 seconds (The ORB came from the direction of the Oakland Coliseum home of the A's & Raiders and came towards my place next Lake Merritt) before i was able to get my phone out and record the next 26 seconds on video, so in total it lasted about 1 minute 40 seconds.   I stopped to call my wife and tell her to come out and look but as soon as i dialed and looked back up it was gone.  I waited outside for 15mins never to see it again.  VERY STRANGE. Next about 30 mins or so later spoke to my neighbor whom said he and his wife and 4 kids saw the same thing.â€¦;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
