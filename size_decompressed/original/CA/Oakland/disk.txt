Cylinder shaped object hoovering within 80 feet of me on a clear evening sky.;1971-08-19 00:00:00;10 minutes;Cylinder shaped object hoovering within 80 feet of me on a clear evening sky. I was in the military on active duty with the Coast Guard in Oakland, CA, but on Governor's Island, which is an estuary.   I was on a second floor barracks facing south when I looked out the window and saw a disc shaped object hoovering above a building across the street from my barracks window.  The object was only 20 feet above the building which gave me a perfect viewing.  I opened the window and looked at how close this object was.  I saw no windows but multicolored lights circumnavigating the object like you would see on an outdoor theater displaying the features at the show.  The disc reminded me of a football shape.   I shouted at a guard passing on the same side of the street to come across the street and look up.  He witnessed it as well.   I ran down the stairs of the barracks to alert the watchman and by the time we both observed this object we saw it jet upwards at an angle with no sound and disappear into the night sky like an open shutter on a camera, leaving a trail of light behind it.   I have been an avid UFO watcher with interest since I was a teenager.  I have shared this story with hundreds of people and even an astronaut that visited our neighboring community several years ago.  He walked on the moon and said he had witnessed UFO's himself.  I am a true believer!;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117

The top was unlit and;1997-11-14 19:55:00;15 minutes;Summary : Saw hovering craft above SF Bay Area above Oakland Coliseum area.  Craft was saucer like from what we could see.  The top was unlit and dark so it was hard to tell what the top looked like.  The bottom part of the craft was bowl shaped with many lights like flood lamps.  They were evenly spaced and looked' like there were hundreds of them.  The craft was not a blimp because it was hovering motionless for a few minutes then rose about 100 feet very quickly within seconds.  It also dropped very rapidly in a straight vertical plane.  It was not affected by wind and stayed motionless in the same location for several minutes there were two such craft and a number of other craft circling in the area.

This was definetly a real saucer I saw.;2001-05-14 18:00:00;Basketball court;This was definetly a real saucer I saw. I was playing basketball with one of my friends, no one was there but the two of us, and while I was dribbling the ball, I shot it, and suddenly I saw three objects, flying in a formation. My first thought was that somebody was playing a hoax. But as the objects came closer, I saw that the objects kind of were bigger than I thought and they were made of metal and as my friend and I pointed to them and looked at them, they suddenly vanished, leaving barely a trail.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
u.f.o sightin in oakland california, object tries to drop lower to the ground;2006-09-16 23:30:00;1 minute;u.f.o sightin in oakland california, object tries to drop lower to the ground My friend and i were drving her boyfriend home {i was driving, she was in the passenger seat and he was behind her) in oakland california, not so far from 106th ave, when we stoped at a stop light. My friend, her boyfriend and i were talking previously about a movie they had just went and seen, just then, my friend looks up into the sky and ask's me is that a plane? i looked up into the sky and i saw a disk shape figure, and it had yellow/orange lights moving from left to right going at a medium speed. i thought to myself that could be a plane, but planes have lights that guide it to where its going. there was no light and there was no movement. it just stayed in one place. and i asked her is that a u.f.o? and she kept tellin me she dont know she dont know... so then i looked at it more, i stared at in staying in one place. and i seen the whole shape of it.. it was like a disk with an upside down U on it. i remember i kept staring at it even when the light turned green, i stayed. All of a sudden the shape started lowering, not like it was landing like a plane, because a plane goes to land in strait forward line, this object was hovering in one place with it circleing, and then it started dropping real slow. strait down. my friends boyfriend, in the back seat kept telling us we were lying, but he opened his door and stuck his head out of the car, and saw the u.f.o also. he seen how scared i was and he told me to drop him off where we were, and he got out the car, as i turned the corner out of the gas station, i looked to see if the object was there and it was gone. it dissapeared. i believe this was a u.f.o. I have seen show's about u.f.o's and i heard they only go on the other half of the united states.. and they go to farms... but this is oakland, CALIFORNIA... no farms... no open area, just the regular city. and also, there was no planes in the sky, tjere was no noise like a plane, and this object was really close to us... enough to see the exact shape of the object.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117

Floating flat disc seen in Oakland, CA.;2012-04-16 18:00:00;5 minutes;Floating flat disc seen in Oakland CA Upon exiting a store, my husband noticed a dark colored object in the sky and pointed it out to me. This object was floating about two miles away and was relatively close to the earth in comparison to an airplane that was also flying near by.  At first, I was convinced that it was a kite or something, but as it came nearer it became obvious that it wasn't a kite or balloon or anything that could float for so long on its own.   We stood watching it in the parking lot of a Home Depot for about 5 minutes as it came directly above us.  It was clearly a very, very flat surface and was actually moving quite slowly, as if being carried by the wind.  Yet, the air was still and there was no strong wind whatsoever to propel it.  It tettered back and forth from side to side, but for the most part, we could only see the bottom of the aircraft. We watched it until it was out of sight. It was still very light outside, yet no one else seemed to see it.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
