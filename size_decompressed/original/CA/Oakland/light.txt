I saw the lights in an arrow formation over San Francisco for 40 minutes and they didn't move an inch.;1994-03-28 17:00:00;40 minutes;I saw the lights in an arrow formation over San Francisco for 40 minutes and they didn't move an inch. Peter asked that we tell him about sightings that we've seen at any time in our lives on Coast to Coast last Friday.  So, here it is. I was driving home from work around late March in 1994.  I can't remember the exact date, but I do know that it was early spring and about 5 pm and it was still light.  I was driving home from Richmond thru Berkeley to Oakland, CA on Highway 80 which runs along SF Bay.  There was a  HUMONGOUS traffic jam and it took forever, which is why I was looking at the sky.  I was bored.  There, in the sky, and it looked to be over the southern part of San Francisco was a number (7?) of lights in an arrow formation.  One of the arrow pieces was missing.  I looked up a few minutes later and it was still there.  I kept thinking it might be airforce planes or helicoptors, but those things move.  These stayed in one place.  Well, the lights stayed in that place about 40 minutes (the time it took me to get through the traffic jam).  I finally had to turn off to another highway and lost sight. I knew it was wierd but didn't have a clue as to what I saw.  Then, several years later when Art Bell was on, and Whitley Streiber was a guest, they were discussing UFO's.  I was in bed listening.  Whitley mentioned that UFO formations are commonly seen in an arrow formation.  Man, I sat up in bed like a bat out of hell!!  Wow.  I sometimes tell peole about this and they look at me funny.  All except my best friend, who said to me If you say you saw it then I know you did.  What a friend. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
Fast moving Green light over Oakland, CA;2001-11-25 20:40:00;5 seconds;Fast moving Green light over Oakland, CA I noticed a green light similar to a green traffic light moving quickly in a straight line accross the sky from south to north, and it passed through some clouds and then dissappeared. I witnessed for approx. 5-10 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and found him to be an exceptionally good witness.  Please see other reports from California for this date and time.  Object may have been a meteor, but we are uncertain, given the other reports we received from other parts of the U. S., Canada, and Brazil for this date.  PD));37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
Stationary, bright white light blinking smaller, colored lights in eastern sky.;2002-01-16 19:30:00;20 minutes;Stationary, bright white light blinking smaller, colored lights in eastern sky. Very bright light in eastern sky, not in line with the planets, which were very visible that night, but to the north of them. The object was stationary during the 20 minutes I was walking home. Light was much larger than any of the planets and was predominately bright white. It also appeared to be blinking smaller, colored lights: orange, blue, yellow, in a regular, rhythmic pattern. Appeared to be high altitude, much higher than aircraft going to and from Oakland and SFO, and also much brighter than lights coming from these aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at Jupiter, which is very bright currently, and would be in the eastern sky at the time indicated.

Clear night in Oakland and my family saw five UFOs over the house;2003-10-24 20:00:00;5 minutes;Clear night in Oakland and my family saw five UFOs over the house I was sitting in my car in my drive way. Saw one light high in the sky directly over my house. I thought it could be a satellite until it excellerated and performed a sharp 180 degree u-turn at high speed. That is when I took notice to a group of five lights matching the movement one at a time. The lights seem to chase each other in an erractic dog-fight style manuver as they flew from north to south in direction. The first light would excellerate, turn immediately in the opposite direction and stop. Then the next light would perform the same manuevur and stop in a formation type pattern. I thought the formation looked a lot like the big-dipper. I thought I haven't seen anything excellerate, make an 180 degree turn and stop. At that point, I ran inside and yelled for the family to come outside and view the UFOs. My wife saw the lights and remarked that they were UFOs, because she couldn't tell what it was. My daughter (10 yrs old) yelled we are being invaded and she sat down on the ground in fear. Later she asked me if they were trying to tell us something because of the formation they kept returning to. My two young boys just watched and never really said anything about it. I told my friends about it. Later, my cousin told me he saw a news report about a person who saw the same thing, but he was in Las Vegas. That's an idea of how high up they were.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117

White light over San Francisco Bay observed from Downtown Oakland;2008-10-02 22:46:00;seconds;White light over San Francisco Bay observed from Downtown Oakland While driving in the south direction of the 880/980 freeway (MacArthur Maze area), I noticed one bright white light in the sky.  The light was southwest of my location, approximately 45 degrees from the horizon.  The light moved down quickly and disappeared in less than a second.  The light was lower than the fog cover.  It moved much much faster than any other air traffic that was in the area. Other aircraft observed were a helicopter and planes landing/taking off from the Oakland Airport..;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
Oakland, CA  bright silver white light traveling north west downward toward the San Francisco Bay;2009-02-01 19:38:00;3-4 seconds;Oakland, CA  bright silver white light traveling north west downward toward the San Francisco Bay I am a 55 year old female college professor.  I was sitting in my living room watching T.V. in front of the northern facing picture window when out of nowhere a bright moving light traveling through the sky caught my eye.  No one else in my home witnessed the event - could not get to the window fast enough.   The sighting lasted approximately 3-4 seconds.  The object was a bright silver white light traveling northwest downward toward the San Francisco Bay.   1st thought it was a private aircraft but then the light (large brilliant silver white, maybe 12 ft. in diameter from my vantage point) shone so brilliantly then instantaneously disappeared.  It seemed to be a light in and of itself.  Not a light coming from a separate source.   Approximate height from ground--100ft. and approximately ¼ - ½ mile away.  Also thought it could have been a falling star but too low to the ground.  The date and time of this sighting is Feb. 1, 2009 7:38 p.m. PST.  Clear night sky and a little over a quarter moon.   There were aircraft flying much higher and farther away in the sky (very probably approaching or departing S.F. International or Oakland International airports).

Strange light over Oakland during the day.;2009-06-14 17:30:00;10 minutes;Strange light over Oakland during the day. I took my daughters to the park and laid in the sun enjoying the cool breeze looking at the party cloudy sky when I saw what I believed to be a chem. trail. That’s what got me looking up in the first place. I then noticed a light traveling north. The color was orangish and seem to pulsate. It was traveling in the opposite direction of the wind, though  at different altitudes the wind could travel in another. I would say it was 15,000 to 20,000 feet high. The speed wasn’t very fast.  I tried to get another park goer to see it but it went behind a passing cloud. The other party reported to me that he has noticed strange lights in the sky for the massed few months in the area as well.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
At least 3 lights seen moving/changing colors from Berkeley CA.;2011-12-17 20:00:00;40 minutes;At least 3 lights seen moving/changing colors from Berkeley CA. Looking toward San Mateo from a high level porch in the Berkeley hills, at least 3 lights were seen by 2 of us. At first, I thought it was wonderful to be seeing three planes at varying distances at just such an angle. Then they did not move and they were changing colors ( red, blue, yellow, orange, green if I remember correctly ). They began moving at sharp angles and sometimes seemed to come together.  I saw three electric prisms, Goliath in size, perform a Voltron dance in the distant sky. This is what I wrote in my journal. It's not meant to sound poetic. It's just the clearest way of explaining what I saw.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117

On a clear night, a large, bright light appeared, dove rapidly, then rapidly ascened, and left.;2013-08-31 21:15:00;20 seconds;On a clear night, a large, bright light appeared, dove rapidly, then rapidly ascened, and left. We were home in the Montclair section of Oakland on a clear night when this very, very bright light came toward us from the Golden Gate Bridge direction (heading East).  It stopped over the area around Grand Ave. and Highway #580.   After about 10 seconds it made a very swift dive south easterly and disappeared behind the hill area above the Mormon Temple.  After a few seconds (about 5 seconds) it came back up at the same speed that it had used to descend.  This speed is maybe 3 to 5 times faster than an airplane's speed.  It hovered a few more seconds and then left.  There was no noise what so ever.  The light was the same color as the landing lights we seen on planes every night.  It did not blink or shut off.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
Intense, stationary bright light in SF Bay Area sky.;2013-10-14 19:15:00;5 minutes;Intense, stationary bright light in SF Bay Area sky. I noticed an intensely bright light in the sky.  It was so intense there was no flickering or change in intensity.  It was completely stationary, absolutely no movement whatsoever.   I took pictures with my phone so not the best images but can share with interested individuals.  In perfect altitudinal alignment was another light.  Less intense and smaller.  Its light twinkled with varying intensity.  This second light was also stationary. I can assure you that these lights were too high up in the sky to be beacons for aircraft. It's possible that they were stars but every star I've ever looked at twinkled of flickered.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117

At precisely 20:20 hours, I looked up into the sky, and high in the night sky, I would say many miles up, I saw two objects of some sort, which were clearly distinguishable as being individual objects, simultaneously emit a pure white flash, and then move in tandem at speed in a N/w direction.  I saw a single bright flash of light at a similar time and location about a month ago. ...  I am 6o years old, with no time for games. ...  These were not conventional aircraft.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
Was it a UFO?  Was it alien?  I don't know but it was crazy weird.;2018-05-04 21:15:00;30 seconds;Was it a UFO?  Was it alien?  I don't know but it was crazy weird. This evening, we were watching stars, and planes flying overhead, from our deck.  We then saw a bright orange light coming from the southwest direction.  It was constant and not flashing it did, however, have streaks or lines of light arcing from the top and bottom.  It was very bright and seemed large given the distance and the amount of light.  It did not fly in a straight path as several times it seemed to wobble side to side before continuing forward.   After approximately 15-20 seconds of this the light seemed to waiver back and forth then suddenly disappeared completely.  We took photos and video but given that it was with a cell phone they are terrible quality.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
Orb like shape changing light remaining at speed and altitude of plane 30 mins before landing.;2019-01-07 20:40:00;13 Mins;Orb like shape changing light remaining at speed and altitude of plane 30 mins before landing LOCATION: on a plane heading in Oakland CA, had to be 30 mins before landing. .WITNESS: not only person who saw it, the person in front of me saw it and also took pictures. SIGHTING: looked out the window because the person in front of me thought they saw something strange.  There was an orb of light following the plane out of the right side a decent distance from the wing.  It was level with the plane and we were still at an altitude that wHere no man-made object was build as well as being over unoccupied land.  it stayed generally the same distance for the 13 minutes it remained with the plane and changed altitude and shape once or twice. we went through a few clouds and it followed, we went through one big cloud and it was gone. THOUGHTS: thought it was strange and went quickly went through what it could be but nothing made sense. could not have been a star bc it was not at the right location. could not have been a building bc there was none and it remained at a high altitude and stayed with a plane going at least 300 mph. was not light from the plane because it was white and did not blink.  It was not a mechanical light. REACTION: thought it was cool and made me think of doc Australian skies. thinking of that as I watched it I made some notes and took a few pictures.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
Two strange lights in the South Eastern sky in S.F. Oakland bay area.;2019-01-24 18:49:00;10 seconds;Two strange lights in the South Eastern sky in S.F. Oakland Bay Area. Today 1/24/2019, at approximately (18:49) 6:49PM -8 GMT, I was outside observing the night sky as I often do, I noticed two bright objects that were out of place in the constellation Orion.  They shimmered from orange to bright white.  Orion was rising in the south eastern sky and these objects were flying in a wedge formation just below the feet of Orion.  There shouldn't be anything that bright there!  I thought to myself.  The objects were more luminous then our brightest star Sirius I also thought which drew my attention to them in the first place.  The lead object was even more so then the trailer.  This viewing lasted approximately ten seconds.  The first object slowly dimmed out of sight still high in the sky, I'd say 30 degrees from the horizon. Then the other about one to two seconds later.  The movement seems to give me an indication to altitude in my opinion.  I view the night sky almost on a daily basis and have seen many things such as satellite's, meteors, high flying military and passenger aircraft.  I cannot say what they were or were not. I can only say THESE LIGHTS WERE VERY STRANGE INDEED!  If anyone else in the San Francisco/Oakland California bay area happened be out at (18:49) 6:49PM observing the south eastern sky and saw this event please don't be afraid to speak up.  I almost didn't want to say anything due to the stigma that go's with U.F.O.'s however we all do need to know what's flying above our heads.
