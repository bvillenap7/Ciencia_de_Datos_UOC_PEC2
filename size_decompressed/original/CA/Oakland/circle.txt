Strange mirage disturbance flying through the sky at high speed over Oakland California.;2008-12-24 00:30:00;1 second;Strange mirage disturbance flying through the sky at high speed over Oakland California. I witnessed what looked like a ships wake in the sky It was transparent/mirage like in appearance, as if someone dragged a ball though the water by a string  viewing it from beneath the waves.  I only noticed it when it moved, seemed to have been there at a stand still as its movement drew my attention to it. The disturbance only lasted for a ½ second to 1 second traveling east to west at a very high rate of speed. There was no light emitted, just an area that wasn’t as dark as the surrounding sky. For the last year or so I have noticed strange happenings in the areas night sky. From lights that can only be seen with a pair of binoculars coming head on towards each other at extreme altitude, (approx. 80,000ft.)   only to have one disappear as they meet, to flashes of light that just appear and then disappear just as fast. These strange sightings have captured my attention that I keep watching nightly for them. Unfortunately they happen too fast to photograph and are too far away to zoom in on. I will try to anyway, someone needs to see these things. Glad to have a someone to report this to. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Huge bright blue circles above Oakland for a few seconds, reappeared 1 mi south 2 sec. later then vanished.  Definately not a plane.;2009-10-28 01:00:00;1 minute;Huge bright blue circles above Oakland for a few seconds, reappeared 1 mi south 2 sec. later then vanished.  Definately not a plane. It was about 1 AM and my girlfriend and I were sitting in my backyard in the Oakland hills looking at the view towards downtown Oakland.  Out of nowhere a gigantic, extremely bright circular blue light appeared over the Piedmont cemetary.  It was so bright and sudden that we both at the same time said Whoah what is that!  It was easy to see the light there because the cemetary is one of the only areas in the cityscape that is completely black at night.  At first i thought it could be cops in the cemetary shining lights or a helicopter, but after about 1 second it was obvious that it was neither. The light was huge, bright blue, circular, and had defined edges. It even lit up some of the trees directly around it. Then for a split second it looked like there could be two circles.  This only lasted for about 3 seconds and just as fast as the huge light had appeared it disappeared.  Then the weirdest part happened.  About 1-2 seconds after the circle(s) disapp! eared, another blue circle (or possibly the same one) appeared at least one mile away to the south.  This time it was merely a flash for about one second after which it disappeared for good.  I cant stress how huge and bright blue this circle of light was, and how defined its shape was.  Looking at the view it was about the size of one of the houses around it.  I couldnt see any sort of craft, just the bright solid light light.

Orange orb hovering over Bay Area. ANother appears and approaches, and hovers then dissapears. .Moves upand down , dims in/out;2010-10-22 20:00:00;approx. 20 minutes;Orange orb hovering over Bay Area.  Another appears and approaches, and hovers then dissapears. .Moves upand down , dims in/out   Last night I saw a bright orange orb hovering in the sky. I was standing on my back porch which is 1 story off the ground. I live in the center-most area of my city (Oakland, Ca) and according to Google satellite my street is 400 ft elevated (I live on a hill).  The orb looked as if it was roughly between 10 and 20 thousand feet off the ground,. I was standing on top of a chair, and with doing so it looked like it was in my direct line of sight, but way across town (I was facing NW).  It seemed to be getting brighter then it would dim out then come back, and it was moving up and down very slowly, then it would stay it one spot. The size of it was small compared to the moon, but large compared to a star.  I saw another orb appear that was not bright as the first, and it slowly drifted towards the first orb making its way directly on top of it.  It then stayed then and got very bright, so bright that they almost looked like one.  The second orb then dimmed out )but! still visible) about a minute later and drifted away in the same direction it was going and disappeared (it went in a straight line).  I zoomed in with my camera and the shape of the object looks like a geometric Pac-man shape.  The original orb stayed in the sky for about 20 minutes (that I saw of it that is)  periodically dimming out then getting bright again. Eventually it drifted slowly away and disappeared.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
4 Orange lights seen over Oakland, CA - Interesting maneuvers and disappearance.  First time sighting!;2012-07-08 21:03:00;5-10 minutes;4 Orange lights seen over Oakland, CA - Interesting maneuvers and disappearance.  First time sighting! I was driving northwest on I-580 between Park blvd. and Lakeshore Ave.  While exiting onto Lakeshore, I saw 4 very bright orange lights in the sky to the west, heading southeast toward me.  My first reaction was that they were a string of planes on their way to land, which is a common sight in the bay area.  They were below the cloud cover, which is relatively low (touches the hilltops), but I couldn’t see any sort of shape to them.  A fourth that was hanging back abruptly caught up, bobbing ad looping as it went. At this point I had run through all the options.  Based on their speed, I am convinced they were “aircraft“, but  they were making turns and altitude changes that appeared unearthly.  They started to turn to the east rather quickly, at which point I couldn’t look anymore, considering I was driving.  After finding a parking spot, I ran out of the car and looked up, only to find one craft slowly moving west to east.  As it sat in the sky, I got a good look at it: Orange orb with yellow edges, no apparent solid shape.  It was larger than Jupiter in the night sky, but definitely smaller than the moon.  It jogged around for a second then seemed to go straight up, fading out through the cloud layers. I saw two men talking where I had stopped, and when they separated I pulled one over to look at what I was seeing.  He was somewhat interested, but figured it was a helicopter and walked back inside his home.  Well, after what I saw, I can safely rule out helicopters, airplanes, or anything inanimate like &quotChinese lanterns&quot.  These things were moving all over the place in their flight path, and were at times going faster than the F-18's that were flying over for the 4th of July.  It was surreal to see the way they moved, it is difficult to put into words. I never thought I would see something like this over my home town.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117

Possible UFO over SF Bay Area.;2020-07-10 21:05:00;20 minutes;Possible UFO over SF Bay Area. The object was clearly round, at a very high elevation but visible,  it was black In color But a very unusual shade, it was Darker than anything I’ve ever seen before as unusual as that sounds.  The object moved slowly initially moving south-East then slowly turned on a northern heading towards the San Francisco area.  It seemed to stall in mid air a couple of times and proceed to an ominously slow movement.  The object increased in speed, it began moving exponentially faster  After about 5 minutes into its northern trajectory and was soon lost due to overcast conditions.  The object did not have any lights nor did it emit any sounds in the 20 minutes  We observed it.  I have to emphasize the unusually dark black color of the object and it’s very unusual slow movement And acceleration.  I’m not one to jump to conclusions and have never claimed to have seen a UFO.  However, this was a very unusual occurrence.  I am reporting this mostly to see if anyone else in the Oakland-SF area saw the same object.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117

White round object around airplane level in the sky jumped around in zig-zag pattern like a mouse cursor, hovered, and disappeared.;2021-08-26 15:35:00;30 seconds;White round object around airplane level in the sky jumped around in zig-zag pattern like a mouse cursor, hovered, and disappeared. I was walking along the Oakland harbor in the afternoon. The sky was deep blue with no clouds. As I was walking, I glanced up at the sky and noticed a round white shape in the sky. It could have been a sphere, an egg, or something along those lines. I did not see any features at all on it, although it was quite far away so it is possible that I just didn't see them if they existed.  It appeared to very high up--perhaps between 5,000 and 25,000 feet high.  When I first saw the object, it was hovering in one place. Then it started moving in an erratic zig-zag fashion. It instantly accelerated an moved at an angle, hovered for a second, then moved at another zig-zag type angle with insant-seeming acceleration, hovered again, and repeated this for perhaps half a dozen short jumps or so. It was generally moving in the direction of the bay/ocean.  I would not have thought much of this object at all had it not been for this strange jumpy movement. The best analogy I have for it is that it reminded me of someone moving a mouse cursor around a screen. It just kind of clumsily and quickly jumps to the new place on the screen where you point it. So while the hovering could be consistent with a quadcopter type drone or something, the sudden erratic jumpy behavior was just unlike anything I've ever seen before. There was no smoothness to it at all. Just: jump! Hover. Jump! Hover.  After the jumping behavior, it hovered in one spot for about 5-10 seconds. I was staring at it the whole time and had stopped walking at this point. While I was staring at it, it disappeared after the 5-10 seconds. For the entire rest of my walk I had my eyes up on the sky scanning for it but I never saw it again.  Within about five minutes, I noticed a helicopter flying around the city that had not been out before. It passed by me twice. The helicopter was much much lower than the UFO. I also saw a small low-flying white airplane pass through this area as well. It did not look like a passenger jet--it seemed much smaller. There is an airport several miles to the south (which is also the direction the UFO was), so the small airplane coming from that direction could just be a coincidence.  I did not have my phone on me because I don't like to take my phone out on walks.;37.8045301391035;-122.228513292117
