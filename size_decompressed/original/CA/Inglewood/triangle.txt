I was right next to Jesse Owens Park and I look up to my left and I see what appeared to be a low flying object...  It was headed in a w/nw direction, not too fast moving... I looked at it for about 16s and I was on my cell phone (nope! no camera on it GAH!) and as I was staring at this thing I noticed bright big white lights of course attached to something but the lights were huge and bright and in a triangle shape.  There were 5 lights specifically not headlights but flat lights...but it also had the normal red and white lights you see on any plane at night so I wasn't to sure that is was man made or not.  It certainly was peculiar and I wonder if anyone saw it also.;33.9611615444014;-118.359436833978
