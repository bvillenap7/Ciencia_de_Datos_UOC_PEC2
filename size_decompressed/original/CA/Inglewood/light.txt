4 spinning/rotating light spreading apart and coming together as one in Hawthorne.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD));2010-12-04 19:30:00;50 minutes;4 spinning/rotating light spreading apart and coming together as one in Hawthorne, Gardena, Torrance California above the clouds. Driving form Inglewood, CA heading South on Crenshaw Blvd. my wife noticed four lights spinning and rotating apart and then coming together as one in the sky. I know it sounds weird. I presumed it was a spot light at the Hawthorne Airport. As we passed the airport we realized it was further south. Now my wife had mentioned to me on 12/02/10  at approx. 14:15 that she had seen a strange prism like rainbow on each side of the sun (have pictures) in the same vicinity. She reminds me, now I am eager to find the source. I drove to El Camino College, Alondra Park and back to Crenshaw Blvd. South, but no light source but the lights are still moving. At this point we are chasing the source and realized the lights are above the clouds. To me it seemed as if it knew we were trying to pin-point its location. As we approached Artesia Blvd. the lights changed from four to three lights and still spinning and rotating. We end up on 182nd street just west of Crenshaw blvd a! nd now the lights changed from three into one light and stopped moving. To all of us it seemed as if it knew we were trying to find its exact location. Finally, we travel North on Prarie and now the one light begins to move erratically(fast) and then disappears. Now i truly believe it was avoiding our vehicle. WE ALL BELIEVE IT WAS SOMETHING JUST ABOVE THE CLOUDS.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
