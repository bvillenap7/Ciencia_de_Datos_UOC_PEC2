Bright, non-commercial aircraft lights near LAX.;2018-02-20 18:40:00;30 seconds;Bright, Non Commercial Aircraft Lights near LAX At approximately 6:40 p.m., Tuesday, Febraury 20, 2018, in Inglewood, California, approximately 3 miles east of LAX, two bright, still lights appeared in the night sky, just southeast of the brightest star in the sky, Sirius.  These two lights did not move, and at first they appeared as bright as the planet, Venus, and maybe as bright or brighter than Sirius, but they did not twinkle as stars do. They were observed to be in the sky for perhaps 30 seconds or less, but then the light to the south of Sirius began to fade, and then grow smaller to a point, and then it disappeared.   Soon after, the second light that was slightly more to the east of Sirius also dimmed to a point and then disappeared entirely.  These lights did not leave any contrails, they were not observed moving across the sky the way drones, helicopters, and aircraft do with navigation lights on (green light on right wing, red light on left wing) or strobing lights used for night time conditions.  The night was clear with no clouds or fog.   All other aircraft near the airport, landing both to and from LAX, including aircraft at higher altitudes not landing but passing near LAX, were seen with their navigation lights blinking clearly.  No fog or mist blocked views of airplane traffic.;33.9611615444014;-118.359436833978
