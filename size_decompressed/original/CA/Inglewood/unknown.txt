One blinking, all moving slowing across the sky.  Possibly satellites, don' t know. In the southern sky at sundown, there was a bright white light in the sky.  It was very clear and the on shore flow of clouds had not started.  There were vapor trials from passing aircraft and very few white swirly clouds.  The object was stationary for the most part, but it moved ever so slight in the sky.  I went indoors and figured it would be gone by the time I returned.  I assumed it to be a satellite.  I returned 10-15 minutes later and noticed two this time. They were in the in the same area, but east of the first one.  They changed positions as them moved to the northwest sky.  I ran inside to get a telescope and the video camera.  When I returned I noticed that there were many visible.  I even saw a cluster of about 8 in the same area, but appeared to be smaller or further away.  They were not easy to find in the clear sky without really concentrating.  Once found, you have to use passing clouds or other objects to remember where they were.  At one time, there were two areas of them at the same time.  One was blinking for whatever reason.  the clouds moving make the object look like it is moving, but it is the clouds moving.  From my vantage point in the back yard, I strained to look almost straight up with my camera.  My neck was almost cramping, etc.  I have about 20 minutes of footage.  I would like to know if these were in fact satellites.  I believe they were I never realized that there were so many satellites in the sky.  I don't expect the military to reveal all of their information about how many or where they are positioned.  It was a spectacular show of satellites (I assume).  I only wish that I had better equipment to record what I saw.;33.9611615444014;-118.359436833978
