Possible International Space Station Siteing;2004-12-30 06:00:00;2 Minutes;Possible International Space Station Siteing This morning at 6am Pacific time, I noticed a light high in the NW sky.  First I thought it was a plane because I live less than 5 miles from LAX.  As I observed the light for a moment, it was moving from the NW to the SW.  At about 06:02 it had passed my location, I did not see it when it had passed over because I was getting my binoculars out of my car.  When I observed the object through the binoculars, I could never hold them steady enough to make out any detail or to better define the shape of the light.  At about 06:04 the light was far in the SW sky and still traveling away. . Other Factors, I was able to make out the planet Saturn thru my binoculars, and the object I saw was much brighter. From my perspective, Saturn was to my South.  I recall seeing the International Space Station many years ago when its fly-by was mentioned on the news.  From my recollection, seems like the object that I was brighter that I remember it, but the object that I saw this morning was kind of on the same flight path that I recall the space station being on years ago.  So it could have been the space station.  Im located at N33 degrees 55 minutes by W118 deg 18 mins. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Possible International Space Station Siteing *** This is a correction to my posting.  The object traveled from the NW to the SE, and the object appeared to be reflecting light oppose to emitting light. ****  This morning at 6am Pacific time, I noticed a light high in the NW sky.
