Blue/triangle horizontal light across the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;15 minutes;blue/triangle horizontal light across the sky At approximately 18:00 on November 7th, 2015 we spotted an extremely long blue light in the sky with a brightly lit point in the front.  We initially thought it was a missile or something because it was moving very quickly.  From our perspective it then transformed into a triangular shape shape of light, increasing rapidly in size still with a bright point at the front leaving an extremely large triangle of light behind it and eventually lighting the entire sky.  After a couple minutes, the front separated from the blue trail light and the bright light that was on the front began to move vertically into the night sky.  The blue trail light lingered for a about 10  minutes and then dissipated and was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));36.4751;-121.7212
