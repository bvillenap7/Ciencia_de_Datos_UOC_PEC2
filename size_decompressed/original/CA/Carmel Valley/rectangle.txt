Please see other reports for this date and time.  By all accounts, the launch was a very dramatic aerial event, seen from many hundreds of miles away from the groundtrack of the missile.)) Rectangular object spotted in sky. Soon after intial sighting two other objects floated down and away from the main object. Then all three disappeared. While driving down Carmel Valley Road, I peered up into the sky and noticed the bright orange retectangular object high  in the sky. We pulled over to observe the strange coincidence. The rectangular object became long and skinny with a white bottom and an orange top. When the object regained it's original shape the were two smaller objects floating down. It almost seemed as if the three objects had an aura around it. Then a few minutes later the main object then  retracted to a smaller shape and kind of came in and out of focus, eventually disappearing along with the two other objects.;36.4751;-121.7212
