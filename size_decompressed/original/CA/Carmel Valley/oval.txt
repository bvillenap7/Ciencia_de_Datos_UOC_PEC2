Sighting of Similar UFO as Posted on AOL Did UFO Visit Peace Rally?;2007-03-15 22:30:00;3 seconds;Sighting of Similar UFO as Posted on AOL Did UFO Visit Peace Rally? I was not going to tell this to anyone, but after I saw a very similar image on AOL titled Did UFO Visit Peace Rally? UFO Sighting in Cleveland tonight and I feel as though I should say something to someone. I was sitting in a hot tub in Carmel Valley, California last Thursday evening around 10:30 P.M. when something caught my eye in the Western sky. At first I thought it was a meteor, by the way it was moving. I watched fly at a high rate of speed toward the East. There were no lights, yet some kind of soft glow and it looked oval in shape and exactly like what I just saw on the AOL clip. It was hard to tell how large it was, as I could not tell how far up in the air it was. I watched it flow steadily across the sky and out of sight. There was no sound of any kind.;36.4751;-121.7212
