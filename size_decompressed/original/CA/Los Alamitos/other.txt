About the size of a thumb in the sky. Looked like what some describe as a fire ball but it was a dim whiteish grey. No sound, clear sky, after three seconds it blinked out. I made a drawing of it.

This one has bin seen before it has 4 spheres.;2004-03-30 12:00:00;20 min;This one has bin seen before it has 4 spheres. This is in regard to the oject seen and reported on 3/29/04 on your home page today 3/30/04. This 4 sphere ufo was seen a few years ago over the military reserve base here in los alamitos. (Just thought this was interesting.) I saw this along with 3 other people, 2 of us looked at this object through a monocular. The way it is discribed is very close to what we witnessed, but for one thing the obect we saw changed in the number of spheres from 4 to 3. Also this was moving into the wind and out over the ocean,(NOT BALLOONS).;33.7976227722772;-118.063125742574
