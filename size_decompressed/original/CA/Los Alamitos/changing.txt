Goodyear Blimp turns into UFO.;1985-07-01 19:00:00;1 minute;Goodyear Blimp turns into UFO. Looked to the southern sky and saw Goodyear blimp approximately 100 feet away.  Very clear what it was.  Saw grid pattern of hull.  Seemed to have an aura of light about it.  As I watched it, sharp image started to get fuzzy and aura seemed to concentrate in the nose of craft which was triangle shaped.  Blimp faded away and triange shot across sky to southwest.  Moments later, two helicopters from Los Alamitos Air Force Reserve Center, circled area and moved off in same direction as object.  Contacted AFRC later and they denied any sightings.  Contacted Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station with info.  They called back and taped description of sighting.  Said that I had seen something and verified that their guys had seen it too.  Said some details were very interesting and they would be back in contact with me.  Never heard from them again.
