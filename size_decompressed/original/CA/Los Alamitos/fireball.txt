Red orb near Orange County, CA military airfield.;2013-04-09 22:00:00;10-15 minutes;Red orb near Orange County, CA military airfield. While driving westbound, we noticed an extremely bright, glowing, red orb with an extremely bright yellow or white light directly in the center.  It appeared to be at least a couple of miles away.  Given the number of aircraft in the skies normally, we were wary to assume it was a UFO as we have had false alarms before.  However, this orb was at least three times brighter than even airliner headlamps, and did not dim, twinkle, or flash despite changing directions several times.  We could not specify exactly where it was over, but it seemed to be near the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station or the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base/Airfield.  The orb seemed to float around lazily, then began to slowly make its way north.  We lost sight of it behind a house for approximately 2-3 seconds.  Once we realized it had vanished, I pulled to the side of the road to get out and look for it.  It was no where to be seen despite being able to see air traffic against the hills 12 miles to the north and ten miles south to the coast.  A couple of seconds later a blackhawk helicopter flew by overhead speeding in the direction of the light not in the direction of the airfield.  (I say speeding because I've seen quite a few flying away and toward the airfield and this one was MUCH louder and flew by overhead much faster than usual.);33.7976227722772;-118.063125742574
