I have videos and screenshots of hundreds things flying in our skies here in Upper Lake California. I  take footage daily.  I am not a “Crack Pot” I’ve been following UFO reports and researching UFOs for most of my life. I just always seem to wind up living where UFOs are stationed at. UFOs have Substaion areas - “Hot Spots” and I live in one of them. This is the second place I’ve lived in where it’s a Substaion.  Wilseyville California was the first Substation Hotspot that I lived in, I didn’t have an IPhone at that time to take footage from Wilseyville California (UFO Hotspot) when I lived there in the early 90’s. . I accidentally captured a UFO photos.  I stumbled upon UFO photos completely by accident by taking photos of our town for someone who lived in the East Coast.  When I developed pictures, I noticed a UFO in the photo and I’ve been busy taking photos and video ever since.  RARELY do I get a day of NOTHING in my photos and videos.  I have to say in all fairness, it’s a bit of an Art finding these UFOs in a video and photo (you must be Sluthy) but once you figure it out, you know what to look for. I’m willing to share my stuff with someone if they make a trip over my way. I have too much to email or print from my phone. Give me a ring or email and I will be happy to accommodate you in  any way I can.  Sicereley, ((name deleted));39.1806;-122.9167
