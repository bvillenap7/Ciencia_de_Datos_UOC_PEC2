I can't say exactly how close it was, but it wasn't far.  The object was a blue with a slight green color within an orb of cloud. There were no other clouds in the sky as we had a windy day. After about ten minutes the cloud dissipated and a faint white light, almost looking like a faint star was observed fading off into the west. The star like light had a cloud coming out of it in a narrow conical shape. I have video of the light in a cloud. I could not get a picture or video of the distant light, as it was too far away.  The blue light remained for another 15 minutes after the event, slowly dissipating. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));33.8132;-117.1055
