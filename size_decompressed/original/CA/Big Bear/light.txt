I ran to the car to get my binoculars naively thinking that if this was too bright to be a regular satellite, maybe it was the International Space Station.  When the object was about at zenith, it slowed to a stop.  My friend and others camping in the area exclaimed in surprise when this happened.  I trained my binoculars on the object and discovered that it was actually two objects, one glowing bright yellow that we had been following with our naked eyes, and the other much dimmer and glowing a deep, deep blue.  While the yellow object was now moving very slowly and steadily, the blue object seemed to orbit tightly, rapidly, and haphazardly around the yellow object, constantly changing directions and speed.  After meandering around the sky above us for maybe 1 or 2 minutes, it began to climb.  I could not judge its altitude.  People around us thought it was anywhere from 20,000 to 100,000 feet up.  Through the binoculars, I guessed that it was about 1,000 to 10,000 feet up and climbing, but who knows?  Eventually, the blue object slipped behind the yellow object and I never saw it again.  At that moment the yellow object began to gyrate rapidly and wildly in a small area and seemed to leave a short trail.  I thought maybe my binoculars were shaking, but this was not the case since the background stars were not themselves gyrating.  The object continued to climb quite rapidly until it was difficult to see even with the binoculars and then we lost it.  I'm guessing this whole thing lasted about 6 minutes, and the whole time we did not hear a sound from the objects.  It is certainly possible that this was some kind of hoax since the RTMC might be a tempting target for hoaxers.  I also considered aircraft from a nearby airport, but its behavior and appearance were unlike any aircraft I have ever seen, and it did not make a sound.  The RTMC is held up in the mountains at a YMCA camp.  The air that night was cool and very still.  I tried to see if at any point the space between these lights would block out the stars behind it, but I could not come to any conclusions mostly because it was always moving and was small even in the binoculars.  Funny that I had a nice digital video camera in the back seat of the car and didn't even think to use it!  About a year after this happened, I contacted an organizer via e-mail.  He saw it, too, but felt that the object was in the hundreds of feet up, and given the venue was probably a hoax of some kind.  I'm a computer programmer and my friend is a mechanical and electrical engineer.  The location of the RTMC can be found here:  http://www.rtmcastronomyexpo.org/index.html;34.2610000000002;-116.8131
Single bright light in Big Bear, CA  sky;2007-06-23 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Single bright light in Big Bear, CA  sky At approximately 9-9:30pm we witnessed a bright light (much brighter than a star) move from North to South in the sky, stop, make slow S curves in a downward fashion, stop, then proceed downward in a straight line and dissappear behind the trees. This event lastest between 1-2 minutes.  The light was brighter than the space station and it was opposite the space station in the sky.  The light was so bright it had four points of brightness eminating from it.;34.2610000000002;-116.8131

Started out seeing one or two lights moving in a small section of sky,  then many more just seemed to appear and move in bunches back and forth in the same small section of sky.  After a few minutes of watching this dance they just disappeared.   While writting this report  my brother started saying there back there back.  The lag time between sightings was about 10 to 15 minutes.   They reappeared in greater numbers in the same section of sky...probably around 40 total, in cluster doing the same dance.  This second wave lasted about this same length of time as the first.;34.2610000000002;-116.8131

It went one direction then went dim and went back in the opposite direction. The light went dark and then blinked a few times before moving in a circular motion only to disappear.;34.2610000000002;-116.8131
Two UFO's flying over Holcomb Valley Pinnacles. Pictures included;2019-08-31 11:58:00;1 minute;Two UFO's flying over Holcomb Valley Pinnacles. Pictures included In late August 2019 my girlfriend and I went camping / climbing in the Holcomb Valley Pinnacles. Everyone went to bed and I took my camera out for some astro photography. I was on top of a huge rock 20 feet in the air with my camera looking out toward the north west over the pinnacles. I saw several planes fly through the sky over an hour or so then I saw two what I thought were planes flying next to one another through the sky headed west north west. I had my camera pointed that way and captured them. Planes make a flashing line in astro photography as you leave the shutter open to allow more light in and there lights are flashing. These ufo's left two solid lines through the photo. I don't know what they were, but they didn't look like planes after I took a closer look at the photos. I could see a solid light as they flew. I've been taking astro photos for a few years now and am pretty familiar with how things look in the sky and pictures. These did not do! anything crazy, but do not look right.;34.2610000000002;-116.8131
