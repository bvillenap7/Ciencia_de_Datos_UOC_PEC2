Star like object in Big Bear, Ca;2012-08-12 03:30:00;6 minutes;star like object in Big Bear, Ca We were observing the open sky watching the meteor shower and my sister pointed out a plane moving across the sky in the far north of our view moving  south and I noticed it looked too far to be a plane and it looked  like a star as we watched it started moving erratically and instantly knew it wasnâ€™t a plane or helicopter it was as if it was jumping in different spots, I showed my wife and father and we all watched it move very fast and erratic far south and it disappeared, after about 15 seconds it reappeared moving at very high speeds going back north, once it got to the middle of the sky it went east until we could no longer see it.;34.2610000000002;-116.8131
