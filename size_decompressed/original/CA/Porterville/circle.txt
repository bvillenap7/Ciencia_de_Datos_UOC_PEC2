UFO paralleling a man made aircraft during a suspected chem-trail operation caught on video.;2013-05-27 19:30:00;15 seconds;UFO paralleling a man made aircraft during a suspected &quotchem-trail&quot operation caught on video. On 05/27/2013 at approximately 7:30pm I was in my backyard in the process of filming a man made aircraft for a video  I was making on &quotchem-trails&quot.   Upon reviewing the video on my P.C.  I noticed that in the first minute of the video I had also captured something strange that I had not noticed during filming, probably because I was looking threw a small digital display while filming.  However, the video clearly shows a dark, round object that appears to come down from a higher elevation, behind the man made aircraft which was heading North.   The UFO then appears to catch up to the airplane and it appears to be flying parallel to the airplane before it vanishes behind a cloud.  The UFO had no contrail behind it nor could sounds of a helicopter be heard.;36.0683000000003;-119.034299999999
A large circular (perfectly round) object glowing amber moved slowly north and west and appeared to stop over Three Rivers CA or there;2017-01-28 05:00:00;5 minutes;A large circular (perfectly round) object glowing amber moved slowly north and west and appeared to stop over Three Rivers, CA, or there abouts  before letting two identical objects drop 90 degrees from the bottom.  The two objects were indentical but very much smaller.  The following day it began to rain heavily with hail.  This was around 1/27 or 28.  The hail event would identify the exact date as we have not had hail before or since for a very long time.  Seeding??  Who knows?
