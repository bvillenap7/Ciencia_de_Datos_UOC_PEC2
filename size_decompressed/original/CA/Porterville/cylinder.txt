More than five aircraft single file going SSE west of Porterville, CA.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-02 05:02:00;3 minutes;More than five aircraft single file going SSE west of Porterville, CA Looked towards the west to see the bright stars and saw movement going south west by stars.  Orangeish color about altitude of jet liners.  Then saw another following.  At equal distance there were al least five more in a single file. Holding my arm out, they were a hand spread apart from each other. Went to my room to get my phone to try to video it.  Did not come out well.
