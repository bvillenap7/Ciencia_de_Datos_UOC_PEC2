I WAS OUT SIDE SUNDAY NIGHT, JULY 18TH, 1999 WATERING MY PLANTS. AT ABOUT 9:30 PM I SAW A LIGHT BRIGHTER THAN ANY STAR, MOVE SLOWLY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH (I WAS LOOKING EAST, HEAD UP AT ABOUT A 60 DEGREE ANGLE). THE LIGHT BECAME BRIGHTER, THEN TWICE AS BRIGHT QUIKLY AS IT SEEMED TO FLIP, GIVING ME THE HINT THAT IT WAS KINDA FLAT SHAPED, THEN MOVED UPWARD TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE SKY FADING OUT VERY QUIKLY. AT ITS BRIGHTEST POINT, IT WAS ABOUT TWICE AS BRIGHT AS VENUS WOULD BE. IT WAS NO AIRPLANE OR SHOOTING STAR. I RAN IN TO GET MY VIDEO CAMERA, BUT IT FADED AWAY TO FAST. THE ENTIRE EVENT LASTED ABOUT TWO MINUTS. PLEASE SEE DIAGRAM I DREW;36.0683000000003;-119.034299999999
