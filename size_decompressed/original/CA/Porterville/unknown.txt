Light over Porterville, Ca.;2005-10-30 19:30:00;30 seconds;Light over Porterville, Ca. I am sending this report in as I just read the earlier post from Porterville.  I was outside Standing in my driveway when I saw this same object.  It caught my attention because the normal air traffic pattern in this area is North/South with very little variation. The only craft I have ever seen traveling East/West are military aircraft of some sort.  I saw this object traveling almost due East.  What I saw was a very bright light that was constant with no flashing or blinking as with normal aircraft lights.  The object appeared to be at a lower altitude or was very large.  I could hear absolutely no sound as it flew over.  I would normally hear a jet engine if it were an airliner or normal military craft.  We have an airport for smaller prop planes near the city, This was definitely not prop driven as we can always hear those planes overhead. Not sure what this craft was, but never have seen anything like it before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));36.0683000000003;-119.034299999999
Bright orange light in the sky and before disappearing it appeared to drop 2 bright lights or fire balls.;2012-01-11 18:45:00;~5 minutes;Bright orange light in the sky and before disappearing it appeared to drop 2 bright lights or fire balls. We exited a building facing South and up in the distance was a bright orange object slowly hovering North-East.  It appeared to stop moving at times, then it would get closer, and it did not move about like a helicopter or airplane.  It also had no blinking lights. We watched this object in the sky for about 5 minutes.  About a minute before it disappeared we had seen what looked like a smaller bright red light fall off or out of the UFO.  Then, as we were discussing that that light may have been a tail light or a wing light, another red light fell off or out of the larger orange object. Only this time, there was no mistaking the red light for a fixed light on the larger object.  This red light was again smaller than the orange light in the sky and it fell downwards quite some distance before it faded out or disappeared.  Within 10 seconds of that 2nd red light, the entire orange light/object flickered and faded out of sight. We were also too far away to discern any shape the object may have had.  To us, it appeared almost like a planet you would see in the night sky.  Only this was about double the size and obviously had characteristics not of a planet!;36.0683000000003;-119.034299999999
