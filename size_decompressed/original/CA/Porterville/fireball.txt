Fireball above Porterville, California.  ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD));2002-10-14 19:02:00;1 minute;Fireball above Porterville, California. As I was driving away from a restaraunt, I saw a bright white fireball rising in the Southwest sky.  It left a trail of debris or gas, and my first thought was that it was a missile.  It seemed to gain altitude, then disappear, leaving behind a contrail of multicolored gases (orange, blue, white).  As I approached my home, a man and his two children were standing at the corner, and I stopped.  He said he thought it was a missile test.  I've never seen anything like it in my life.  The trail of gases persisted for approximately 10 minutes after the fireball disappeared.  I noted what I believe to be an aircraft in the vicinity of the fireball. ((Vandenberg rocket launch.

A bright red glowing light that was loosing altitude coming from the western sky and going east towards the horizon;2005-11-05 19:55:00;approx. 2 min.;A bright red glowing light that was loosing altitude coming from the western sky and going east towards the horizon It was a bright red glowing light.  At first my wife and I thought someone had fired off some fire works but then we noticed that it lasted way to long and the trajectory did not match that of a fire cracker.  Then we thought it was an airplane but the light also shortly after certainly was not that of a plane. So we thought possibly it was a meteorite but we have never seen a meteorite last as long as this light did and it got closer and closer to the horizon and then it disappeared.  I have seen some interesting sights over the years such as the Northern Lights when I lived in Washington and when I made trips to Canada but this was unique.  I do not believe that life from other planets, similar to ourselves, is visiting us because of the technology that would have to be obtained and that even at the speed of light it would take milleniums just to travel any where in the universe.  I do believe in higher life forms of an angelic type but  such contact at this point in time would be of those angels that have rebelled against man's creator and are actually enemies of mankind which is reflected in 2 Corinthians 11:14, 1 John 5:19 and Revelation 12:9.  But I strongly do not believe that this situation has anything to do with what we saw. I would like a logical explaination for this unidentified red light appearance.  Was the red light caused by some type of natural occurance or was it man made?  After my wife saw the light she told me that a teen age son of a friend of ours saw the same type of light last night.  He shared this with my wife this afternoon at about 1 pm when my wife was visiting with his mother.;36.0683000000003;-119.034299999999
huge craft moving at incredible speed after hovering for about 3 hours;2009-03-07 22:15:00;3 hours;huge craft moving at incredible speed after hovering for about 3 hours At around 7:30 PM on March 7, 2009, my boyfriend and I observed what we thought was a very bright star in the western sky. It was much closer then any other stars and it was relatively large but it was not moving, just hovering there, so we ruled out and airplane or helicopter.  At around 10:15 PM I had to drive my brother and sister to their grandmotherâ€™s house for the night. The kids went outside first while I grabbed my things. One of them screamed so I ran out to see what was wrong. They immediately pointed to the object which we earlier thought was a very bright star or planet, but this time it was bright red, still sitting in the very same spot it was just 3 hours before. By this time my boyfriend and my other brother had also emerged from the house. After observing it for about five minutes the big bright red ball shot across the sky at an amazing speed and covered a distance in one second that would take any airplane a good 5-10 seconds to cover. Then it slowly faded out and was gone.;36.0683000000003;-119.034299999999
