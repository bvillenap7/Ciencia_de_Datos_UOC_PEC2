It was me, my brother and our friend we decided to go to the restroom, when we where done we walk several feet away from the restrooms my brother and friend decided stop and and chit chat mean while I'm just looking around and then I see a light brown flying saucer fly across just above the trees and zips straight up into sky and disappear and a soon as one zips up the next one follows in the exact same path and several follow.   As many as 15 flying saucers one right after the other in daylight hours about 300 yards away and about 5 stories high the object where flying.  During the time the saucer where flying by I told my brother to take a look up in the sky he ignored me then I ask him again he was so annoyed by me and he told me to wait while he talks to our friend so I continued to look up in the sky till there where all gone.   Since I was the young one they never ask me what I wanted so I never said anything until we where adults.  I can tell my brother belives me now.

I watched a ufo cruise by my house at  21:00 at low altitudes, noiselessly with ferriswheel  lights wit a strangesaucer shape.;2001-01-25 21:00:00;2 minutes;I watched a ufo cruise by my house at  21:00 at low altitudes, noiselessly with ferriswheel  lights wit a strangesaucer shape. It was approx. 8:45-9:00 P.M. It was a cloudy night with rain falling sporadically, I was letting my cat out to do her thing when I noticed a Saucer shaped vehicle moving very slowly with no noise whatsoever. It was approx. at a 200 ft. altitude level and it was close enough that I could tell it to be about the size of an 18 wheeler truck. If you put your arm out and stuck your thumb out horizontal it would be the size of your thumb from nail to knuckle. My best guess is that it was about 300 yrds out. I was looking west from my porch, and the vehicle was traveling from north to south at approx. 5 miles per hour, coming to full stops occasionally for 1 or 2 seconds then continuing on till it disappeared from my sight. It had spinning lights red, blue, white and green it had the appearance of a circus Ferris wheel. The sighting took place within a 2-3 minute period. When it started to rain , I realised that I was standing in my front yard with nothing but my underwear and I returned to my home .;36.0683000000003;-119.034299999999

Bright orange lights turn into slow moving saucer shaped object in the night sky.;2014-02-20 22:00:00;15 minutes;Bright orange lights turn into slow moving saucer shaped object in the night sky. At 9:00 my daughter and I went out for our evening walk and had been walking for about an hour when we came back to my house.  We were standing at the end of my drive looking at the stars when my daughter pointed out what at first looked like a bright orange fire ball but it was quite a ways away.  At first it was sitting in the same spot but after a few minutes it started moving in our direction which would have been north.  It moved very slow and as we watched the lights started flashing.  We watched to see if it was an airplane but it did not look like an airplane as there were no red lights and the lights that were on it had started flashing and seemed to be moving around the object.  The object was nearly over us and it slanted as it turned and the top of the object had what I can only describe as a dome.  It then began moving faster and as it went over us we could see the lights that were orange and moved around the outside of the object.  It never got! close to us or close to the ground but close enough that we could see the lights and the dome.  Finally after about 15 minutes of watching the object sped up and we could no longer see it.;36.0683000000003;-119.034299999999
