round ball hovering change colors from blue, red and orange;2009-09-20 23:30:00;30 plus min and still out;round ball hovering change colors from blue, red and orange It’s about 11:30pm Sunday night and my mom  ask me to look at a bright glowing star that keeps changing colors from blue, red to orange and it’s not moving at all, so I go out side and what would u know it’s there just glowing in all 3 different colors. Looks like a station helicopter but very far away and very high in the night sky. my mom my step dad and me watched this object for about 45 min. 15 min into it I get my old Video recorded and I start to record this object. As I’m trying to zoom in u can see it change colors. And the camera is trying to focus on this object but it can’t. I had to plug it in because the battery is dead. But with some luck I’m able to get some video of this UFO. Oh yea and the dogs in the vicinity are barking like crazy.;36.0683000000003;-119.034299999999
