Triangle shaped Bright Red Strobes Observed;2007-08-21 22:30:00;1 minute;Triangle shaped Bright Red Strobes Observed In the late evening hours on 9-21-07 I was outside in my front yard before turning in for the night. I have seen a few weird things in the sky in the past few years but mostly just solid white lights that move quickly from east to west when the normal air traffic flow is north and south in this area. Last night I looked up to the sky to the north/east and immediately saw three very bright red strobes in the shape of a triangle. I noticed that the stars were blocked out in the middle and it was just black. The strobes were constant with no black out at all. The object was slowly moving from east to west/northwest. There was no sound at all. This object had to have been either very large or extremely close. I tend to believe that it was a combination of both. I opened my front door and called to my wife who was inside the house. She came out but the lights were to distant and she could not see them. She then called to me and stated did it look like that? I looked to the north east sky and saw a second group of lights that was exactly like the first and following the same path. It was once again three very bright red strobes in the shape of a triangle. We watched this set of lights pass overhead the same as the first until they went out of site to the north west. I would beleive that they were military related only because I witnessed a similar type incident in the 80's late at night when a very strange shaped craft passed overhead in plain view of at least two witnesses. Both were full time law enforcement officers same as I. The next morning there was breaking news announcing the brand new B-2 stealth Bomber. My wife and I are now both real estate professionals and non drinkers for the most part.;36.0683000000003;-119.034299999999

At that point I could make out a black triangle with one very dim blue light on one corner. It came a little closer and hovered for approximately 10 seconds and then vanished.;36.0683000000003;-119.034299999999
