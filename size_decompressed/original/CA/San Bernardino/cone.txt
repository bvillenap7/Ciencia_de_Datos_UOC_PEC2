Floats, zig zags, stables and vanishes hours later. Appears early morning. Stays in one are of the sky for a long time. Than it will zig zag.  Moves fast.  Looks like there's two together.  A pair with bright white lights.  Sometimes it looks like its just floating around.  Strange!   I been noticing it northeast of the city for at least one month.  Not every day but at least 4x weekly. I have taken many videos and pictures.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
