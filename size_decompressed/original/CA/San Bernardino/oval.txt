As my wife was getting out of the back yard spa she seen an unusual object quickly approach from the west. I was standing inside our kitchen, as she ran to follow the bright orange/red star like object. I ran outside to she what she was fussing about, at that time I saw the object and being a skeptic told her it was Jupiter. But I was astonished at its brightness. My first thought was what a good oppertunity to see this planet at its best. I then turned to get my binoculars from the house telling her to keep her eye on it. As I took my first step towards the house she shouted the something was going on. I turned to see the bright object drop or launch a shiney object that faded quickly followed by another less brilliant object. Then the main object pulsed sevral time then vanished. I was stunned at what I had just seen, yet I felt honored to witness such an event. It's not over yet. I went in and called the police since thier helocopter was flying in the same field of view. I reported to them what I had saw. They gave me a local MUFON phone number which I have not be contacted back yet. Story continues as the object returned again from the west with more brightness. At the time it reappeared my wife and I were discussing the first sighting with some neighbors. And at that point we gathered more neighbors to witness the second event that was very simular to the fist. Ten people witnessed the second event and nobody admits to ever seeing anything like it before.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104

It was a large snow flake shape object, we couldn't see the body of it only orange beautiful lights in a snow flake shape. It was hanging in the sky going very slow from the east to west and parallel to back yard line which boarders the Vulcan Materials gravel pit.  It looked like to could have about 300 yards away and directly over the pit but it's impossible to say. Our windows were open and it was completely silent and low in the sky and moving so slow we could barely tell it was moving.  It stayed on a perfect course as I could compare its movement to the stationary fence line that is on our back yard boarded. It was really pretty like some sort of light show on a cable be pulled from our left to right.  No way it could have though because where it was, is really no man's land, being over the gravel pit and private property.  Very weird, we watched it about 5 minutes until it was out of sight and moved toward North Fontana.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
