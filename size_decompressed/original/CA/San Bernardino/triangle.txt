1999 Camping with friend in backyard triangular craft 20ft away...perfectly silent completely still.;1999-05-01 03:00:00;5-10 minutes;1999 Camping with friend in backyard triangular craft 20ft away...perfectly silent completely still. First off im now in the US Navy. Anyway, I was 12 years old and me and my old best friend were camping in my backyard. At around 2:00AM the sprinklers came on and woke us up. We rushed outside the tent tp put a cover over us and we had some trouble trying ro get back to sleep. Bored took control and we looked for something to do. I had a few books and we read a few of them outload for some entertainment. It was my friends turn to read and as he was reading I looked outside then tent window. I gazed into the sky it was extremely clear out. One star caught my attention. It wasnt the movement thought that caught me at first. It was how bright it was. Slightly brighter then most of the stars. It was Northeast of us and I couldnt take my eyes off it. Then I noticed movement. Extremely slow movement. If you werent staring at the star and concentrating you wouldnt of noticed it. I told my friend to take a look and he used the binocculars he brang when we went hiking earlier that night. After focusing for about 15minutes we began to hear weird noises from the back side of the wall behind my house. More than likely it was animals. So we shrugged it off and looked at the star again. After another 5minutes I lost interest and picked up the book again. Like 30 seconds later my friend kept saying Oh shoot, oh shoot, look! before I even looked all the hairs on my body were standing on end. I looked out the window and froze. A triangular like craft was hovering 20 feet from me right over my backyard wall. The lights were bring but seemed to be pointed and concentrated on a few parts of the yard. It had exactly four lights. One on each corner of the craft and one dead center.     Each angle one the craft was equivalent. You couldnt tell which angle was the from of the ship. It made no noise whatsoever it was almost like it sucked the sound out of world around us. I knew it wasnt a plain because it was PERFECTLY still and the shape was too perfect to be anytype of plane. I live on the front of the San Bernardino MTS so it was also too low to be a plane. The only available thing left to assume is a helicopter but again it was silent no noise whatsoever. This is my only explaination. Anyway, it sat there for about 3 to 4 miutes and I never spoke or took my eyes off it. In an instant it left to the distance still visible. When I mean distance i mean like half a second or less. And we watched it fly accross the sky at extreme speeds. It was one hell of an experiance. Afterwords we sat still for another 2minutes unable to speak or move. We ran to my mothers room and told her and that was about it.  My old best friend isnt my fiend anymore. He did some stuff with my sister and that drove me away and last I saw him he was really really into drugs. I dont kno where or how he is now.

Big triangular somethingchecks out former AFB.;2009-02-23 05:10:00;4-5 minutes;Big triangular something checks out former AFB. I woke up for my workout and rolled into the kitchen looked out the window over the former Norton AFB and saw three lights, white, red and yellow hovering over the former base.  I thought maybe it was a blimp, angled away from me, I do see blimps every now and then over it.  Then it banked (heading west) very slowly. I remember thinking I should go get my camera, but I felt it was more important I absorb the encounter accuratly.  It went out of sight and I went to the west window of my house to see it slowly fly west, thats when I truely saw how big this was.  But here is the good part.   Unless it did som trick maneuvers its present direction would take it over the 10-30 interchange.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
