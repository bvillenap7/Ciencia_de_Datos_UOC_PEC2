The lig;1990-07-01 21:00:00;5 minutes;Three bright pinpoint lights (looked like stars or comets) approaching equidistent in thirds from horizon to meet in sky above. The lights paused just before they would have intersected hanging for a moment before they began to circle rapidly and the paused again before shooting off in the same direction.  The lights were about the same brightness as the north star in the sky and were easily noticable. I realize that this behavior is similar to the patterns recognized in car dealership or opening ceremony lights, but there are distinct differences. The lights were not beams, they had no apparent source of origin. The lights were not bright discts reflecting in the nearby conddensation but instead appeared to be very far away. The lights also did not appear to behave in any fashion similar to modern aricraft, even today. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Flash of halogen-quality light on fast moving object;2002-07-04 20:23:00;15 sec,;Flash of halogen-quality light on fast moving object We were driving home on July 4th mid evening.  The sky was not completely dark yet.  Fireworks were just starting to be set.  The light we saw appeared like an instantaneous flash of halogen light. It skipped over an area and flashed again.  We saw it flash four times before is left the valley.  It started in the west end of the valley and covered an area headed east of about 30-40 miles in just 10 seconds or less.  At first, we thought it was an airplane, but it moved too quickly, and covered a long distance.  It was NOT fireworks, because of the distance it covered, and the light was consistant with each flash.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
