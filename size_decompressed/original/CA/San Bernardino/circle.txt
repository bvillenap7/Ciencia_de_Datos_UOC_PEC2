Circular impression in back yard about 80 to 100 feet wide.;2008-01-15 12:00:00;30 days;Circular impression in back yard about 80 to 100 feet wide. I might be crazy, but There is an impression in my back yard that I noticed about one month ago. I first saw it and thought it was made by my friend moving his trailer around in the back yard. As I paid closer attention I noticed that it was a perfect circle (it appeared to me) and not only one circle indentation in the ground but several smaller circles inside of it. My father in law brought his big diesel truck in the back yard and did not leave any tracks or impressions that lasted as long as this circular pattern has. It is about 80 to 100 feet across and I have documented it on video because it is so weird how it got there and there are no tracks that leave the pattern. I am not a ufo freak but this is not something that you see every day. I am contacting you guys because  the pattern is still there even after the rain and me cutting the grass over it. And that seems pretty weird to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
