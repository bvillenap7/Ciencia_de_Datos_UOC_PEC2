A flying ball of light with no structure, no sound, and no strobes or anticolision, navigational lights. Moved too fast for a STOL.;1998-07-15 05:00:00;Approx. 3 min.;A flying ball of light with no structure, no sound, and no strobes or anticolision, navigational lights. Moved too fast for a STOL. At about 5:00 a.m. July 15 1998, I was walking my babbysiter home to her condo( we live in the same complex ), I noticed that there were two bright stars out, and recognised them as planets ( witch ones they were, I don't know, but am sure one was venus! ), also a half to almost three quarter moon. I showed them to my sitter, and we awed at how bright they all were even though the sun was starting to come up behind them. We were about three houses from the sitters when I looked up and saw another bright light that looked like another star, I told my sitter to look up, and immediatly she said  hey look another big star!  , I asked her if she noticed that it was moving in a jerking motion, and she said something silly about how ofcourse it was because everything is moving and orbiting.( ? whatever ) I told her to stop walking so we could get a closer look because even though there are two airports within a 10 mile radius, March A.B., and ofcourse Edwards not too far away that have aircraft flying over our community many times a day, and myself being an Air Force vetran who has worked on several types of aircraft, and familliar with many forigne ones to as part of that then profession, I could not recognize what I was seeing. At first I thought it was a civillian 747 type coming in for a landing with its landing gear lights on because it was so low, but it was going too fast to make a safe landing anywhere. Then I considerd it may be a jet fighter from one of the nearby bases with its lantern on, but yet the light was too bright, and other things came to mind why it couldn't be that. When it got just about over us I asked my sitter to look for any blinking lights, and to listen for the engine. As it quickly flew over us we did not detect any form of navigational, anticolision, beacon, or strobe light on it, and no noise came from it either. As it passed us  overhead we also looked for any kind of structure ( wings, tail etc. )it had none, just a big ball of light. Also when it got over us we could only se! e light, and at every position it was only light, for when a aircraft flys over you with any kind of light on, eventualy when it passes, the light is no longer that visable and you will see the back of the aircraft, this never happened. It maintained a complete light source at all angles. Well we didn't dottle around to see where it went because my sitter began to panic and wanted to go home quickly. I got her home, she went inside her house, and as I turned to leave for home it came back over, only this time it was much higher and faster. I considered that I was misstaken, that what I saw was realy just an airliner, and the second sighting was a sattelite, but it still seems way too odd. I mean the way it moved, the speed and alltitude were way off from the norm of any man made aircraft. I replay it in my mind, and talk to my sitter to confirm what had happened. I also find myself watching the ussual parade of aircraft flying over at different times of day trying to reenact what I saw, and still nothing comes close to it. I'm sure there is probably an explaination for it, but I doubt I'll ever know what exactly it was. I just thought it was real weird, and it went against my years of knowledge in aircraft flight. It may just have been experimental goings on. Who knows? I've never realy been a big believer in E.T UFOs in any case.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
Three very large triangular widely separated lights in the sky which formed a triangular pattern.;2002-03-20 06:15:00;8 minutes;Three very large triangular widely separated lights in the sky which formed a triangular pattern. A friend was driving me to Ontario airport when we noticed 3 large triangular lights in the distance straight ahead of us just above the horizon.  We were traveling East on the 10 (San Bernardino) freeway.  The large triangular lights themselves formed a large triangular pattern.  They were very bright and quite large.  They were not planes and the sun was up already.  I remarked about how odd the sighting was.  She confirmed how strange it was. We both travel to Ontario airport often and had never seen anything like this. After about 7 or 8 minutes we exited the freeway into the airport and I ran to catch my plane.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
2 different high speed objects observed from the little dipper.;2003-08-30 04:05:00;5 seconds;2 different high speed objects observed from the little dipper. I was looking at the Little Dipper through my telescope and noticed a light almost like a star moving rather quickly considering the distance it was from me. I told the other person to look at what I was seeing and we were able to see it with the naked eye for another few seconds till it disapeared. A few minutes later while looking at the same area in the Little Dipper I noticed another of the same type of object. I followed it this time with my telescope and was not able to keep up with it. I tried to focus on it better but it seemed to be in focus with other stars in the sky... This lead me to believe that it was at a very far distance from earth. the time/date of this was: 04:05am Pacific Time 08/31/2003 ((NUFORC Note:  Flaw in date.  We suspect the witness means August 30, since that is the date on which the report arrived.  We will confirm the date with the witness, and we have amended the date above.

Has anyone else seen bright orange lights in the sky? This year?;2004-06-24 11:10:00;5;Has anyone else seen bright orange lights in the sky? This year? Im on my way to work driving up Little Mountain Road from Kendall Drive in San Bernardino when I noticed an orange light in the sky. First I saw it and thought it was an airplane but it wasn't moving. Then before my eyes it disappeared. It reappeared while I called my girlfriend to tell her what Id just seen, it was stagnate for maybe about 5 mins. Last month, I remember  seeing this before and at that time it was two lights in the sky.  This time I see one, around the same time and in the same area.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
Star like object that was making very elaborate, non-pattern movements in the sky.;2006-02-15 21:00:00;10 Minutes;Star like object that was making very elaborate, non-pattern movements in the sky. After Church on a Thursday sometime in February my ex-girlfriend and I were sitting on top of my car star gazing. At first I thought it was a falling star and had her make a wish but as it was falling it suddenly stopped. It then went back the other way like it was retracing its steps, and stopped again. And proceeded to do very elaborate circles, then shot east across the sky and did the same thing. This “falling star” for about 10 minutes was making very non-pattern movements in the sky. We stopped staring and left to grab my video camera but we never could find it again. The place we saw this “ufo” was very open, and empty (i.e. an empty church parking lot). It was a very clear night, and along with my ex her mom was one of the witnesses as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Bright noisless light stationary, then moving in night sky;2007-07-15 04:30:00;15 seconds;Bright noisless light stationary, then moving in night sky July 15th, 2007, 4:30 am California time: witnessed a large bright light traveling north in a straight line, eventually fading from view behind mountain range in north west San Bernardino. Object looked like a very bright star, but brighter than all the other stars. Extremly bright. Traveled silently as fast as a jet, but slower than a falling star. It was higher than air traffic in this area, but lower than the stars. Pace was constant and trajectory was smooth with no deviation. No trail. I had woken up from a dream involving the mountains and went outside to journal my dream. I had been looking at the night sky (dusting of clouds and stars) and then began writing. The star I had noticed a moment before started moving as described. I was startled and thought, Oh, that wasn't a star, but how did I miss that?. Then I just watched it thinking, I've never seen a plane move in that direction, nor travel in that direction. I strained to listen for sound, but it was completely silent. I thought it was a ufo.

Stationary,high altitude, bright pulsing light;2009-07-07 04:45:00;1 minute;Stationary,high altitude, bright pulsing light I never had any reason to look up at the stars unless there was a meteor shower going on.  I am a maintenance technician and that changed when I got stuck working the graveyard shift about a year and a half ago.  At work we can't smoke in the break room so me and the guys have to go outside to burn one.  That's when one of the maintenance guys said that recently he saw a bright light in the sky that was turning off and on and it never moved.  Another one of the maintenance guys said he saw something like that too, he said it was weird almost like it was taking pictures because the light would get bright then turn off.  They both agreed that that the light was stationary and turned off and on a total of 2 to 3 times.  Well I have seen this bright light in the sky a total of 3 times since then.The first time it was about 2:30 am located in the western sky ,thats when a bright light caught my attention from the corner of my eye.  I kept looking in that direction and saw nothing but a few seconds later there it was again, got real bright then dimmed out. The second time I was with a friend he said hey look over there it's one of those bright lights again.  It was in the northern sky about 3:00 am and it was there for about a good 2 minutes turning on and off about 6 times in 30 second intervals.The most recent sighting is July 7,2009 at 4:45 am I was outside setting up my tripod for my telescope, I was excited to see Jupitor for the first time through a telescope, the skys were clear and Jupitor was really bright. As I was getting lined up with the spotting scope there it was a bright light that would dim out for about 30 seconds then reappear. It repeated this process about 3 times. This bright light doesn't give off that gleem like Venus and Jupitor give off, but the size and brightness are about the same.It does give a pulse like affect as it seems to grow in brightness then dims out and then repeats that cycle about 3 times. It seems to be stationary I have never seen it move.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104

strange light over san bernardino;2010-09-14 19:00:00;3 mins;strange light over san bernardino basically at about 8pm looked up as a white owl passed right over my head and noticed a silent light moving at a very steady pace not too fast but not hovering,  I live somewhat close to an airport there are planes in the sky all hours of day and night the difference is you can hear them and see the flashing collision lights,  with this the olny reason I looked up is because I heard and saw the huge white owl passing right over top,   now I felt for some reason to keep watching the light so as I ran from backyard to front of house sure enough about 1 min after passing right over me the light dimmed rapidly into nothing it was moving from northwest to southeast dimmed right as it was about to fly over the city lights (I live just outside the city) ive seen meteor showers and shooting stars ect.   this was moving too slow and no trail seemed to be fairly low to the ground ,  I really hope someone else out there saw this thing ...;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104

My friends and I saw a yellow light moving across the night sky with another light behind it and suddenly lights shot out from it.;2011-04-03 23:45:00;15 minutes;My friends and I saw a yellow light moving across the night sky with another light behind it and suddenly lights shot out from it. On April 3rd of 2011 at approximately 11:45pm, my friends and I identified what appeared to be a yellowish light moving across the night sky.  It was moving pretty slow, however it seemed bigger than what a helicopter or plane would look like in the sky.  I freaked out and started recording it, but my cellphone was terrible quality as opposed to what was really being seen.  We didn't think much of it after a while until a little light would appear behind it.  When that started to happen that's when our attention was 100 percent on the moving object. As we watched the light/object moving, we noticed it was moving upward but going in a slanted route. The little light would appear off and on behind it.  As it moved towards the moon, it came to a complete halt.  All of a sudden these little lights were dropping out of it almost as if they were like shooting stars because the lights that were shooting out would disappear as they shot out.  And it was going on for quite a while and we even felt a little uneasy because it was literally so bizarre and amazing.  And then it just disappeared like it literally went poof (no sound was made).  Not even gaining speed or anything it just was there and then it wasn't.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104

It was floating around the way a helium balloon would with a consistent medium brightness, about 250m up.  Then, it stopped moving and elevated as an commercial airplane approached.  As the two got closer the mysterious light dimmed.  When it became almost invisible in the night sky, it flashed white, then disappeared.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104

The object that we saw gave off a bright white light then became fainter, almost disappearing then really bright again, then fainter before disappearing.  The object was really moving fast and had to be traveling at least 3 x's faster than the ISS. Approx.60% Elev.-Approach 11% above SW-Departure 11% above NE;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
