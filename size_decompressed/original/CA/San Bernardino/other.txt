AND AN ''L'' SHAPE FIGURE WENT THREW AND LEFT IT'S SHAPE IN THE CLOUDS. TIGHT CORNERS AT EACH TIP OF THE SHAPE. IT WAS VARY CLOUDY. 3 OF US SEEN THE SHAPE. IT HAS BEN ALMOST 4 YEARS SINCE I SEEN THIS. IT WAS ONE OBJECT FROM WHAT I CAN TELL. THE SIZE OF THE SHAPE WAS AS BIG AS A FOOTBALL FIELD I BELIEVE. I DID NOT SEE THE SHAPE MADE, BUT I BELIVE IT WAS VARY UNUSUAL FOR THE SHAPE TO BE THERE THAT WAY IN THE SKY. I DO SAY TODAY I SEEN SOMETHING AND I REGRET NOT PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THIS.

At this time I lived by the san Bernardino mountains ant attended San Bernardino valley college.  There was a 50 mile distance between my home and school.  I park at a nearby field by my school, note that I am parked facing the san bernardinotn.  I notice northeast of my vision three bright lights entering the horizon, slowly crossing the mtns.  From there it began a steady decline just above my head.  It hovered over me for about a half hour.  I continued staring at the lights and recorded 3 different videos of this unexplained phenomena.  It looked like these lights were connected to something invisible. I don't know what I saw.  It was so quiet and it left the same way it arrived.  It was about a 45 degree angle on how it went towards me and upward back into the sky.  One of my video attempts on this object I record a normal plane flying by over the object.  The lights and object itself looked ! as if it decreased altitude so it would not be hit by the plane.  This even is the biggest question mark in my life.  If you guys can help and somehow work with my videos that would be great.  It took me this long to come out with the event because I just didn't know what to do or who can help.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
I now know that there are u.f.o's for certain.still cannot believe my experience this morning.out of this world!!;2017-07-28 10:13:00;5 minutes;i now know that there are u.f.o's for certain.  still cannot believe my experience this morning.  out of this world!! it was at approx. 2000 ft., traveling west to east-object was glowing a gold color.  It was changing into other shapes as it moved through the sky.at first i thought it was a canopy-(parachute) not a parachute.  as it got closer to me-1500 feet i began to see it cycling between different shapes-it seemed to jump along-instead of traveling in a straight line.  i was almost terrified, as i have never witnessed anything similar.  i am a private pilot-+4000 hours-w/instrument rating.  as it came to be parallel with old Norton AFB it turned toward the base.-airport.disappeared over the airport.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
