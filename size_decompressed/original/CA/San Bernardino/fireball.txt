flickering  fireball object  burning across the skies;2009-11-22 21:44:00;2 minutes;flickering  fireball object  burning across the skies my family and I were about to walk into our apartment when we looked up at the sky a we noticed what appeared to be a shooting star.  As we looked at it moving across the sky it started to break off little balls of debris but still on fire and then burned out.  Then the fire ball began to flicker as it was burning out.   It started out going south and then turned east for about 30 seconds when it abruptly changed directions 180 and started falling. The weirdest thing was that it started gliding like a plastic bag or a kite but in OUR direction.  We actually had to run away from our spot because it got so close.....AND if thats not enough,  WHAT EVER IT IS, IS STILL ON OUR ROOF!!!!  NOT KIDDING.  We dont know what it is...and yes its on our roof!!!;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
I saw three orange lights that came at different times and went out like a flame on a candle at different times.;2010-02-13 00:15:00;10 minutes;I saw three orange lights that came at different times and went out like a flame on a candle at different times. I stepped outside onto my back porch and looked up at the sky.  Emmediately I notice to balls of fire.  They were orange and they were moving.  They moved for a few minutes getting closer and then light started shooting out of them on the bottom and they disapeared, first one, then a minute later the other one. That was in the west.  The third one came from the north and looked like it was coming straight towards my direction.  It was big and bright. I had time to go and wake up my husband so he could come outside and see.  When he came out, it took what seemed like five minutes for it to shoot out light and then sputter out and disapear.  After that happened.  About five minutes later, what looked like a very big bag was floating down and it landed on the main street about seven houses down from my house.  I think that was just a bag, I could't tell because it was dark.  It made me want to go down the street though to look, but my husband wasn't willing to go because its cold and late, so I stayed in and got on the internet to see if anyone else saw it.   I have seen manys strange things in the sky, but never that.  I saw something once that looked like a battle happening in space.  I counted 14 total lights chasing each other.  I would have taken a picture of what i saw, but I don't have a camera.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
Five amber red balls.  3 disappear and 2 combine into one over San bernardino ca.;2011-02-13 20:00:00;15 minutes;Five amber red balls. 3 disappear and 2 combine into one over San bernardino ca. The sky wad already dark because it was around 8:40 pm my friend noticed them and I looked up and far in the atmosphere   We saw 5 amber red balls stationary in the sky.  We continued to watch them for 15 minutes within that time they started to move around in the same area they were in.3 of them seemed to disappear (my theory exit our atmosphere) furthermore, the remaining to slowlry merged together and became one.once it was just one it seemed to dim out then reappear but a few seconds later it was gone.
