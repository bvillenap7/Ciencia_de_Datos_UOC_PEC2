We are normal people, and we never believed in ufo's before. It was a little past midnight when we were sitting on our porche and we seen a bright light flashing so we looked up at the sky to see what was happening, and we seen a 3dementional diamond shaped craft it was turning round and round and shooting off diffrent colors, blue,purple red and orange, it was weird because we didn't see it appear and it stayed above us for at least ten minutes just spinning arround we just stared at it,we didnt even see it leave it was there than it was gone. I will never forget that momment it didnt even look like a craft really, besides the fact that it was spinning. I was 17yr.s old at the time he was 25yrs old at the time, we never thought we would ever encounter something like this before, we have never done drugs before, we both go to church and have a relationship with god, I work as a secretary for a big company and have never told anyone this before because I knew people would laugh, but I can tell you I wasn't laughing when I seen it I was scared because what if the ufo came down and captured us,I mean it stayed put it didnt seem like it was going any where it was like they were studing us or something,waiting for the right time to land,we were nervous to tell people as if they would know we did and come back to finish what ever it came here for,or maybe it just wanted to see our planet but how would we really know why so we kept it secret till now,so now you know and I will leave it at that.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104

AT FIRST IT LOOKED JUST LIKE VENUS (1/2 LIT)....WE TRACKED IT....IT SEEMED TO GET FASTER AS IT WENT BUT DIDNT HAVE A STEADY FLOW.  THE LINE IT TRAVELED WAS STRAIGHT WHICH LEAD ME TO BELIEVE IT MIGHT BE A SATELITE. IT SLOWED AND FLASHED, THEN ON EACH SIDE FLEW OUT TWO SMALLER BRIGHT LIGHTS.....STRAIGHT OUT. ONE TO EACH SIDE...SO IN MY SCOPE THERE WAS A SMALL LIGHT A LARGE LIGHT AND THEN ANOTHER EACH SMALLER GOING STARIGHT OUT. TOTALY AMAZING....;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
