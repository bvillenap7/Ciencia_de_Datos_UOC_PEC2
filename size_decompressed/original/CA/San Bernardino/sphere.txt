(They were the color of what the sun would look like at sun rise). They kept coming close I said  ufo's before my son turned around he thought I was kidding. But when he saw them he said what the hell. He got his camera to take pictures. I went across the street to tell my neighbor, she got her camera and also took photos also her children where also watching the 3 strange balls of lights. Then my son's friend drove up in his car and also watch the lights do movements in the sky. When my son and I frist saw them I was terrified I actually thoght it was the end of the world, because they looked so big, perfect circles of lights. As soon as they went higher in the night skys I felt more at ease. One of the lights went to the east and then disapear the other two stayed side by side then they also disapear without a trace. I have never seen anything like that nor has my neighbor, or my son nor his friend. Also that night I called  the sheriff dept to see if anyone reported these strange objects in the sky, nobody did and I contacted a T.V. station nobody reported anything and nothing his been reported in the local paper. 3 balls of lights the color is like when the sun rises in the morning. The night was clear.  They where huge like 3 full moon coming towards me and my son. They where coming from the south of the sky. Then they stayed above my house for awhile moveing around  then they went higher in the sky, one of the ball of light went east the two other stayed south the one in the east disapear without a trace then a jet or airplane was going towards the other two then they disapear. There was 6 witness to this event . My son took a whole roll of film and there is nothin on the film. My neighbors photots of the object is also blank.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
Eastern part of the sky towards direction of brightest star in the sky.;2002-01-13 20:30:00;30-45 seconds;Eastern part of the sky towards direction of brightest star in the sky. Dull orange colored orb. High altitude much higher than airplane flights. Orb moved slow in straight path and did not pulsate. Did not appear to be a fire ball. I was playing with my cat and reached down to put the cat down for a few seconds, when I looked for the object again I was unable to locate.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
Orange ball of light moving in all directions and going through the atmosphere (burning).  ON VIDEO!;2002-10-07 23:50:00;about 15-20 minutes;Orange ball of light moving in all directions and going through the atmosphere (burning).  ON VIDEO! A friend and I were sitting on high ground looking at a mountain (large hill) and witnessed a bright light rising from the base of the mountain which we both first thought to be some sort of strang off road vehicle or equivalent going up a road we were not familure with.  It rose gradually and slowly at first up the mountain towards the west at about a 45 degree angle.  It then past the silhoulet of the mountain and kept rising in about a 45 degree angle into the sky.  It was then my friend and I kinda looked at each other and said out loud that that wasnt anything normal.  Not a plan nore a helocopter of any sort.  There were NO SOUNDS and NO BLINKING LIGHTS like on plans.  I can only describe it as a ball of orange/yellow flam.  Or a spherical orange ball that seemed to pulsate at times.  (moved in all directions up, down, left right)After it traveled a bit to the west, it stoped, hovered, then changed directions slowly to the east.  It was at this time my friend and I became a little uncomfortable and desided to start back to my home.  As we ran back to my house to fetch the video camera we kept an eye on it, stoping a few times to see what direction and speed it was taking.  I rushed into my house (which was about 75 yards away) and woke up my family and got my video camera.  I was followed by my father, sister and mother out into the front yard to gaze.  I was so exited that the camera jared a lot at first.  However, I was able to get it trailing off into the west going up and then burning through the atmosphere.

Two orbiting spheres in broad daylight.;2005-02-16 15:00:00;apx. 2 minutes;Two orbiting spheres in broad daylight. It was raining out and the sky was evenly gray. I glanced out the window and saw what looked like a black pill shape, but it was flying closer to the ground than a commercial airline would. So I thought it might be one of those helicopters that are slightly pill shaped with dual helicopter blades in front and rear. But I've never seen one of those in the air. For this reason, my interest was piqued.  As I watched it though, it seperated and I saw that it was actually two black spheres flying very close together. I continued to watch them and they would move apart and then back together and they repeated this motion. I then realized that they were orbiting each other. I watched as long as I could, but my view became obstructed by an adjacent building. Other people outside may have seen the spheres. They were in plain view.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104

No wind in area so that wasn't it.   Also I was listening to Pandora on my phone (I'm working in my back yard) killed the signal for about 5 min. I've seen others (first time reporting) and it seems they follow the mountain range I live next to.  Interesting.  Thank you.;34.1499754571021;-117.31123066104
