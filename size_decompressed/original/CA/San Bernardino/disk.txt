At around sun set, when the surroundings started getting dark, a man approached me at a gas station and asked me wheather I had a camera. I said no. Then he said to me did you see the saucer up there?. I was astonished and kept looking at it until it disappeared behing a motel/multi storied building up hill. My profession is architecture and I do design of building. I tried to see the detail of it. I saw it straight above my head. I did not know the distance but the size to me was about 16 inch. It was moving very slowly with a smooth rotation. It had multiple bluish white lights around the disk, not less than 8, it could be upto 12. If I try I can still draw a picture of that disk/UFO. The lights were very pleasent and smooth. It did not make any sound and did not leave any fume behind like aeroplane does. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It was white, didn't make any noise. I didn't see how it got there. After a few seconds, it jetted up at an angle really quickly.;2011-03-01 15:30:00;A few seconds;It was white, didn't make any noise.  I didn't see how it got there.
