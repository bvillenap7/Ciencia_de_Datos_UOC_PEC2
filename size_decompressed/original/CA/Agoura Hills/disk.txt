ufo sighted with 6 kids in my car in Agoura Hills, CA @2004-2005?;2004-04-01 21:00:00;10 minutes;ufo sighted with 6 kids in my car in Agoura Hills, CA @2004-2005? I was with my young son, about 5 years old, picking up 5 girls from a dance class in Agoura, CA. When I drove on the road parallel to Highway 101, at a corner, and just above a telephone pole or electric pole, was a craft floating above us. I asked all in the car if they were seeing what I saw, and they confirmed it, and it hovered for a short time and then we watched it cross over the hills and I kept moving in the car toward the 101 freeway (driving South or East depending on the road) and it disappeared over the Santa Monica Mountains. I tried to figure out where to report it that night, to no avail.  I know that it was not technology from the earth as I know it, and it looked just like someone might picture a UFO disc with different colored lights spinning all around it’s “middle” - it really looked like a UFO I might picture in my minds eye.  Anyway, I enjoy your reports, and have never known quite how to properly share this.  Thank you!;34.1226999999999;-118.7573
