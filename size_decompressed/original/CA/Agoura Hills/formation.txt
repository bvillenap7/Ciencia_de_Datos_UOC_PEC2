Three white dots flying across the sky in Agoura Hills, CA;2006-03-14 18:45:00;10 seconds;Three white dots flying across the sky in Agoura Hills, CA I was working in Agoura Hills, CA in the evening.  I walked out of the office to take a cell phone call and saw three dots in the sky - circles of light, not sparkly or shining and refracting light like a star or an LED, just smooth sort of matte white dots with a discernible diameter (a bit less than 1/4 the size of the moon on a typical night). The dots were north of me, and they appeared to be several miles away from me, about 70 degrees up from the horizon and falling very rapidly in a formation pattern, much faster than a plane or any object would normally descend, but I thought I was seeing a plane flying straight down and I said so to the person I was talking to on the phone, then the dots seemed to swirl around each other for an instant at about 30-40 degrees above the horizon and then immediately turned out of the descent and began moving parallel to the horizon, moving directly east for a few seconds, then they seemed to swirl around each other again and went straight down again, descending below my field of view which was blocked by a bunch of tall trees across the street. And that was it. I didn't see an object attached to the dots - just the white dots themselves. No trails, no haze, no glow, no sound, just white dots moving in a formation pattern descending, then flying east, then descending again below my field of view. I kept watching and did not see them reappear. A person was on the phone with me while this was happening and heard me reacting to the event (various exclamations and four letter words).;34.1226999999999;-118.7573
