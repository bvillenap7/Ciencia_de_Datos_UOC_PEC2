My daughter and I saw a UFO high up in the night sky, far to the north of us.   A very intense bright white large round light with a purple color blinking intermittently within it.   It was darting around - up, down, sideways and circled back around again. It repeated the motions again, up, down, sideways, etc.  Lasted about 3-4 minutes then darted in the opposite direction but appeared to be slanting downwards towards Earth and disappeared.  There was no noise.   We live in an area surrounded by mountains.  The object was too far above the mountains there were stars around it in the night sky.;34.1226999999999;-118.7573
