Formation of lights over West Hollywood, CA.;2012-02-13 19:00:00;1 minute;Formation of lights over West Hollywood, CA My daughter-in-law and her daughter were driving northeast on Santa Monica Boulevard on February 13, 2012 at approximately 6-7 PM.  A formation of lights appeared in the sky in front of their car.   The objects were self-illuminated, constant in intensity, white no other colors were observed.  They were moving only a little faster than the girls were driving, perhaps 80-100 miles per hour maximum.   The objects made no sound.   While they were watching one object spiraled down and disappeared while another disappeared suddenly.   The girls did not attempt to follow and did not alert any authorities.  All the objects eventually disappeared.   The objects each varied position relative to each other like a dance.  The brightness of each these objects did not vary until they disappeared...   The girls did not think that these were flares.  The objects were separate from each other. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgGBnUONSqQ;34.0903758454105;-118.374831400967
