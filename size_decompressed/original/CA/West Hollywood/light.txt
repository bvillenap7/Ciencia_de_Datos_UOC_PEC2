Perseid) meteor shower and noticed an object directly in line with distant stars. Object was was too far to be moving as fast as it was.   Watched the object cover a distance with a consistent speed over what could have been hundreds of miles.  The object was visible for approximately 1.5 minutes when suddenly vanished, gone.   It was definitely not a meteor - we witness several of those and this was definitely not one of them.;34.0903758454105;-118.374831400967
Green and red lights hovering and dipping.;2014-04-14 20:00:00;45 seconds;Green and red lights hovering and dipping. My colleague first noticed the object and said, What is that?   My other colleague said a helicopter,but as we watched it moved from hover to dipping across the sky in a way no helicopter we have seen do.   The object has three bright green lights and two red lights that I recall. It hovered, then moved rapidly across the sky, then hovered again, then moved out of our vision.  Three of us saw the object clearly.;34.0903758454105;-118.374831400967
