It moved around slowly in the same area descending and ascending for about an hour. I left at around 5p.m. I went to buy a disposable camera at the 7-11 a block away. At 5:12 p.m. the sphere over the banana tree was gone. I sat for a couple minutes looking the sky over, and I found to the east two more. (Both looked the same as the first sphere over the tree.)  I watched these two spheres as they slowly headed west, stopping directly over an obvious incoming and outgoing flight lane. During that time a plane heading southwest for LAX pasted directly under the two spheres. I took two photos of this, but they did not come out.  I watched these two sphere’s for about 15-20 minutes, as two more planes (separate times) leaving LAX heading east had also passed under the objects. I snapped another 4 photo’s but these also didn’t come out.  A low cloud cover came through the area at 5:35p.m. I lost sight of the two spheres, as they passed through the clouds. When the cover burned off 10 minutes later I spotted directly over the moon another sphere heading west.  The moon was in the southeast portion of the sky. I took a picture of that sphere with the moon.  It came out but it only looks like a light spot with a dark bottom.  A few minutes later another sphere heading east passed over the moon. So now I was watching two spheres.  One is moving to the east, and one moving to the west. The second moving to the east was a lot closer. With the naked eye you could see structure to it.  It was obviously nothing conventional.  I had also taken pictures of these two spheres together. I had earlier in the afternoon seen a couple Mylar balloons drift by and when they became the size of the sphere’s you could still see the strings on the balloons, so I knew that what I was watching was not any balloon. All the spheres at some time went against the wind.  The balloons did not!  The sphere moving to the west eventually went out of sight.  The sphere moving to the east eventually positioned itself in one spot in the sky, and during that time other’s joined it. At one point there may have been as many as five spheres in the sky. It was hard to tell because they seemed to fade in and out. Thes! e spheres were very hard to see with the naked eye.  But once you spotted them you couldn’t miss them.  This went on for about twenty minutes or so and then they one by one disappeared.;34.0903758454105;-118.374831400967
5 lit spheres heading east over Beverly Hills-West Hollywood CA;2012-04-17 21:10:00;20 secnds;5 lit spheres heading east over Beverly Hills-West Hollywood CA At approximately 9:10pm on Tuesday, April 17, while walking my dog I observed 5 lit (white light) spheres in formation heading east over the Cities of Beverly Hills-West Hollywood.  My first thought were military planes as they were in formation (diamond), but there was absolutely no sound from them and they seemed to be round and about the size of a SUV.  They widened there formation and then went back into formation heading east.  They were about 500 feet in altitude.;34.0903758454105;-118.374831400967
