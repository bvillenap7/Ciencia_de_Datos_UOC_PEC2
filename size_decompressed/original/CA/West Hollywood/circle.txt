Hollywood - W.Hollywood flying high, possibly in the sky for hours 4:00 to 7:30. We were waiting in this parking lot when I saw a white to brownish circle shaped craft. I pointed it out to my friend and replied thats the thing I pointed out about two hours ago. He said there were three. He then pointed them out to me. They were in a dimond formation and there were planes flying from west to east toward Burbank air port. The craft were high over head at about a seventy degree angle in the East. They moved about for a while all at diferent altitudes juging by there hue. I had to leave so I didn't see them for more than twenty minutes. They looked big.;34.0903758454105;-118.374831400967
