Fire ball object at high altitude heading north to south over Lake County California .;2002-07-06 20:30:00;15 minutes;Fire ball object at high altitude heading north to south over Lake County California . My roomate called me from his c-phone and told me to look up at the sky to the north west .  I did so and noticed a very slow moving fire ball looking object . If you were to hold a ruler at arms length , It took about ten minutes to travel twelve inches . I viewed the object through my binoculers and could not see a craft of any kind from my angle . It traveled beyond the tree line at very high altitude not going with any known flight path that ive recorded . All aircraft over my area go from north to south and  north west to south east . This object was going south to north .;38.9602;-122.6334
Bright orange lights above Clearlake, CA.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-18 20:40:00;1 minute;Bright orange lights above Clearlake, CA I witnessed 9 bright orange lights in the sky above Clearlake, California.  They appeared in a line and then started to move to more of a circular shape.  One moved through the circular formation without striking any of the others and dissapeared.  Within 60 seconds the rest dissapeared one by one.  There was no sound, and seemed to be close. When they faded away there was no trail.  The only trail I witnessed was from the one light that flew through the circular formation.;38.9602;-122.6334
