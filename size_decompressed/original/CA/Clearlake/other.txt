The cubed link there were two links visible over Clearlake, Ca... The incident occurred over the town of Clearlake.   The object was silvery in color with no lights, and was moving fast at about 20,000-25,000 feet.  I first saw the right half of the object, then the left side seemed to just appear like the right side did, as if de-cloaking..   I then saw the object clearly it was two cubes each with a sphere inside it, and the cube's corners were rounded, and linked like a train/chain thing.   Each cube was about 20 stories cubed and the sphere's edges stuck out from inside cube.   I went to get my camera and when I got back it was gone.  It was about 10-12 seconds in duration,and was heading SSW as of sighting...   I drew what the object looked like and am e-mailing the image..;38.9602;-122.6334
