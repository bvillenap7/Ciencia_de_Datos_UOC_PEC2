Two lights flying close together and then fading away.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));2007-06-19 22:45:00;About 20 seconds;Two lights flying close together and then fading away. I was out in my backyard taking in the fresh air when I spotted two moving lights in the sky. They looked just like bright stars, or air planes without the blinking lights. One was flying behind the other, both at about the speed of an air plane. If you held your fingers up to the sky, they were about a 4 1/2 inches apart. They kept at about that same distance moving South East. Then, over a period of about 5 seconds, they both faded away. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??

Bright single light over santa cruz mountians with military jet following it.;2009-03-26 09:25:00;30 sec. - 1min.;Bright single light over santa cruz mountians with military jet following it. From a distance my girlfriend and I were outside and noticed a airplane over the Santa Cruz Mountians. In front of the plane which was very visable their was a white/yellow light in front of it. We could hear the goverment type JET's noise but only one. The other light then seemed to slowly be speeding up and then we watched the JET speed up and see a large flames behiend the jet. like when the blew angles use their afterburners. The other light started speeding off faster than the Jet could keep up. And was quickly no longer visable. The jet still seemed to be following or escorting it. After that i also noticed that the San Jose airport was using a different landing path for the comercial airlines which i know they do during bad weather, because they fly right over my house only when it it raining Which it was Clear. This event was very odd due to i could tell that their was a military jet behiend the light. but could not tell what type of light and or shape it was.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
