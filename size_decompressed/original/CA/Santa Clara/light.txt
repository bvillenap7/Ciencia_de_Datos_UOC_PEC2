At approximately 12:40am, we witnessed a bright bluish-white light which appeared to be flying very slowly, almost hovering in the sky.  After a few seconds it then accelerated at an extremly high rate of speed, then disappeared.  The object made no sound whatsoever as it traversed across the sky.  It was witnessed by 4 police officers, my girlfriend, and myself.  The location of the sighting was Santa Clara, CA at 37.346992 N, 121.983848 W.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
turqoise light in the sly  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  Many reports.  PD));2000-07-07 20:30:00;10 minutes?;turqoise light in the sly Saw turqoise color, fairly bright light high up in the sky (not far from the moon). The sky was mostly clear at the time. The light was fog-like and first was a longer stripe, then 5 minutes after I went to see it again and it had changed to a more round shape with undefined edges. Very unusual color and it was quite large. I didn't see any movement. After 30 minutes I went to check it again and by that time clouds had covered the area and I couldn't see the light anymore. This incident reminds quite a lot of the one I saw reported on 03/13 at 8pm in the same area.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
2 high flying objects traveling at great speeds across the night sky.;2001-06-24 22:30:00;20 seconds;2 high flying objects traveling at great speeds across the night sky. As U was standing in my back yard looking up at the night sky, I noticed a satellite coming across the night sky, and just beyond its direction of travel I saw 2 redish/orong colored lights traveling in the same direction as if they were connected bbut with a uncertian distance between them. They seem to be as high as the satellite but moving at a greater speed. So fast that even a low flying plane could not possible fly as fast given thier apparent distance from me. They were flying perpendicular to the first 2 stars of the Big Dipper. As a few seconds went by they seem to have turned 45 degrees to the left  and then split another 45 degrees going in the opposite direction, and then they were out of sight.The night is clear with no clouds in the sky and the moon was in a totally different part of the night sky. Don't know what it was, but I know they were not planes or satellites and they had no apperant sounds comimg from them,not even trailing them as planes do.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204

The diameter and height of the light could not be determined. The intensity of the light seemed as a distant automobile light but very white. There was a halo and the beam was visible for a short distance from the light as a searchlight beam can be seen when it not aimed directly at the observer. No sound was associated with the beam. The beam was undulating rapidly, too fast for searching the ground. When the beam was extinguished small lights sinilar to a firework burst appeared, with no noise, in a plane centered on the light and perpendicular to it for about one second. It was not an airplane or helicopter. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  Please see article.  PD)) ((BEGIN ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE ABOUT LAUNCH)) Air Force Test Missile Out West Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly, said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said. Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show. We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early, Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets. Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is, Gabel said. The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability. ((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS));37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
A very bright multi colored light that shot across the sky and then vanished.;2004-09-26 20:43:00;1 second;A very bright multi colored light that shot across the sky and then vanished. We just returned from dinner and as we were walking up the driveway i looked down the street and in the sky myself and my girlfriend saw a light go from bright white to blue to red in a long streak which lasted for just over 1 second.  it is hard to say how long in distance the streak was but it may have been a half mile in length.  I know for a fact that this was no shooting star because i have seen many myself.  this was very fast and the way it changed colors and just dissapeared so quickly and the other thing was that it seemed to be close to me in distance.  being at night it may have been a few miles away.  it occured so fast that i couldnt see any shape but it had no sound to identify with.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
two lights moving very fast high in the night sky on June 22,2008;2008-06-22 11:00:00;six seconds;two lights moving very fast high in the night sky on June 22,2008 I was looking through the sightings on this site and came across a report from June 22/2008 that was posted on 7/5/08. What was described is exactly what I that night. So I guess I want to verify what the other person saw that night . I saw two lights moving  high in the night sky moving very fast for about six seconds. The lights were side by side in parallel. The light on the right was moving ahead then behind as they moved from the south to the north. The lights were not very bright. I was glad to read that someone else had seen the same thing that I did from the same city and at the same time. The lights were a reddish-orange color and made no sound.

Blue/green blinking noiseless light stops in mid-air and gains altitude, turns white/red and flies away quickly.;2017-12-10 18:00:00;3 minutes;Blue/green blinking noiseless light stops in mid-air and gains altitude, turns white/red and flies away quickly. Looked up to see flashing blue/green light moving overhead, the light flashed about once a second.  After observing for a few seconds it stopped in mid air and flew straight up, turning white with a red light just below it.  After flying up a distance it stopped and flew back the way it came at a fast speed, changing from white back into blinking blue/green. It disappeared momentarily and reappeared a few seconds later a little farther, about 6 miles away.  It hovered high up still blinking for about 20-30 seconds and then vanished.  No noise was heard.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
