UNKNOWN SPACE DEBRIS TRAVELING NORTH WITH A VERY LARGE CONE SHAPE VAPOR TRAIL;2002-09-19 19:35:00;2mins;UNKNOWN SPACE DEBRIS TRAVELING NORTH WITH A VERY LARGE CONE SHAPE VAPOR TRAIL ON 9/19/02, AT APPROX 1935 HRS, THE SUN WAS DOWN BEYOND THE HORIZON AND THE SKY WAS A LIGHT BLUE TURNING TO NIGHT.  I HAPPENED TO LOOK UP AND SAW A VERY BRIGHT WHITE VAPOR TRAIL WITH A BRIGHT WHITE HOT SPHERE LEADING THE WAY AND TRAVELING DUE NORTH.  I COULD TELL THAT THE SPHERE WAS SLOWING DOWN AND A HUGE WHITE CONE SHAPE VAPOR BEGAN TO EMINATE FRON THE SPHERE.  THE SPHERE SLOWED TO A STOP AND DISAPPEARED.  THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT.  THE WHITE VAPOR TRAIL REMAINED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.  THIS SIGHTING WAS EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL ESPECIALLY SEEING THE CONE VAPOR TRAIL.  MY IMPRESSION IS THAT THIS WAS SPACE DEBRIS BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS TYPE OF DISPLAY FROM A METORITE. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  Please see article.  PD)) ((BEGIN ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE ABOUT LAUNCH)) Air Force Test Missile Out West Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly, said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said. Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show. We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early, Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets. Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is, Gabel said. The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability. ((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS));37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204

The object appeared to be round in shape and moved with no sound whatsoever. There were no trail marks to indicate that it might be an aircraft. The object gave off a metallic white-blue color. After I observed the object for about 15 seconds it just disappeared.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204

The light would flash bright silvery-white then pulsate from the size and brightness of Venus to a pinhead. As this was happening a group of 5 lights moving from the south to the north crossed in front of the bright flashing light. The lights were at different altitudes. The 5 lights were in a group of 3 with 2 lights off to the side.The objects made no sound. The 3 were making circles around each other as they moved. All of a sudden the 5 lights blinked off as did the very bright pulsating light. I figured the big bright light was at about 10,000ft and the 5 others were at about 8,000ft. I see a lot of planes in the sky from the San Francisco and Oakland Airport flying over head and they are that altitude judging from when they turn off their landing lights. This sighting took place in Santa Clara, California.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
brilliant mercury-sized light moving irratically at high speed over Santa Cruz mountains;2009-09-08 20:18:00;20+ seconds;brilliant mercury-sized light moving irratically at high speed over Santa Cruz mountains At 20:18 hours my wife and I were sitting in the back yard looking to skies in the south, watching commercial aircraft flying on approach to SFO. We saw what we first thought to be the lights of an airliner, but then noticed there were no red, green, or strobe lights on the moving object, just a very bright, white light moving initially in a straight line but at greatly varying speeds. My wife and I both got up at the same time asking aloud, What the hell is that?,  when the object darted upward at a 45-degree angle, again, at a very high rate of speed, and then slowed, and appeared to do an inverted loop. The object then moved quite erratically, and then did an “infinity” figure 8 maneuver before appearing to spin out of control at a 45-degree angle downward and then disappearing behind the silhouette of the Santa Cruz mountains. We observed the object for AT LEAST 20 seconds. Object appeared to be 30-35 miles away (no real way of telliing). At no time did the intensity of the light (which was the spherical object) fade.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
Three fiery orange-red orbs, all seen about 5 minutes apart, ascended into space on a near vertical path.;2014-01-01 00:20:00;25 minutes;Three fiery orange-red orbs, all seen about 5 minutes apart, ascended into space on a near vertical path. At midnight I was having a cigarette with one of my friends in front of my house.  A car had just skidded off the road into the side of my neighbor's house not far away.  It was New Year’s Eve and we listened to people in the area setting off fireworks, but none were visible from my street.  We were watching the antics with the police and tow truck for a while. At about 12:15 AM, my friend pointed out a bright orb that had just appeared in the sky to the west.  The light cast off of the object was far more intense than any airplanes or helicopters we've ever seen in the skies, so we caught it all on our phones' video cameras. The light from the object had a much deeper amber-red hue to it, which really caught our attention. It traveled a long, curved path and passed overhead.  The object then ascended vertically at a higher speed, until it was it was out of sight completely. About 5 minutes later I spotted a second object (matching the description of the first) suddenly appear in the sky, as if it materialized out of thin air.  It eventually flew straight up into the sky like the first, until it could no longer be seen.  A few minutes later a third one had appeared, hovered, ascended, and went out of sight.  All three objects were slow moving, until they changed courses up to the sky and sped up significantly.  We didn't know what to make of the whole scene in the sky, and we would have filed a report sooner if we had the first clue how to go about doing so.  At least we got some videos of them!  It was cool to see!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ43c0x-gyI http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKrQiA8yaa4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz5kyXIwr9U;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
