Me and my son were down town Santa Clara cal when we were getting back in to my car. He told me what is that over head I look up and saw what look like two 6 foot balloons floating together about 10ft apart. They were dark in color and shape like a peanut. They both were flashing on the top as if sun light was reflecting off them both objects seem to wobble and flash at the same time. When l saw the objects they were at least 100ft in the sky moving around 5 to 10 miles hr. I told my son that they were baloons tide together. Soon they were out of sight I drove my car to get a better look at them. As they were headed to the Santa Cruz mountains. The sky was very clear that day we got out of the car to take a look as they travel across the valley they both were still 20 to 30 ft apart soon they look like two bright stars. All at once they flew together making one object it lasted for about 3:min to 4:min one took off stright up around 15 thousand ft while the ! other object stood in one place, soon it shot upwards to meet the other oject and was gone.

Each object followed the same arch/path.  Each turned due west toward costal mountains almost exactly alligned with my home, but  west of me.  Their lights did not strob, the color was a light pink, they were absolutely silent even as they arched overhead.  The incident was reported to the local police as the 3rd object appeared- while the event was occurring.  Each faded into the cloud cover after they made the turn west.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204

I looked up and spotted the disk gliding along against regular flight lanes.  Of both the San Jose Airport & the Sf Airport, at arms length holding a battery of an Ear Aid was about the same size.  The object turned slightly with the suns reflection glistening off of it.  It was at this time it went off In a zig zag pattern and disappeared into the horizon, there were few clouds and extremely blue skies.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
