Fast moving gliding oval shaped object in the sky just before Great America Parkway Fireworks event on Sunday May 28, 2006.;2006-05-28 20:00:00;15 seconds;Fast moving gliding oval shaped object in the sky just before Great America Parkway Fireworks event on Sunday May 28, 2006. I tend to think that this was a man made object - I do not believe in UFOs. I could have dismissed this as some kind of balloon - except that something struck me odd. This was some kind of oval shaped object - perhaps the closest thing I can think of is football (american). No visible things protruding outside the eliptical, oval shell shape. I can't remember the color, but I think it was sort of greyish. This thing was so benign and innocent that you would see it but would not even notice it. So naturally fitting in the sky.  I realized that there were three things odd - (1) it was high in the sky must be roughly somewhere between 1000 ft to 10000 ft - a plane flew from San Jose airport and its size and height was of the comparable order. So, I thought it perhaps is not a balloon as I have not seen balloons of  plane sizes.  (2) It was moving at an incredible thing. It did not look like any object having an engine - no audible noise, no smoke trail, and it was sort of gliding - something like an orphan kite. But it was going from west to east, and speed seemed 10 times faster than a jet. It cleared the whole sky in my view in less than 15 seconds, while I think a plane would have taken at least 2 minues or so. (3) towards the end it was so far that I would have lost it anyway but then it sort of started gaining altitude. Significant gain in about a couple of seconds. If it was not for logically thinking about these things, I would have completely ignored and not even remembered about this.  I was with my Dad. As I felt something odd about this object, I pointed it to my dad. He saw this as well. I pointed to him my logical inconsistency of speed - he seemed to agree. We were in Great America Parkway waiting for the fireworks when this happened. Time must be between 8:00 to 8:30pm. There must be a few thousand people right there looking into the sky. I did not talk to any one, but I was hoping that someone else saw it. I surfed web to see any information, tried to dismiss it as some sort of balloon. But could not find any conclussive evidence either way. Nor did find any one else mentioning this. So I decided to report it. If there are more people who saw this and can conclussively identify this as man made object, I would be thankful. This would solve the puzzle and satisfy my curiosity.  Please note that I am not an expert on aircrafts, balloons, natural phenomenon, or any other such things that could explain many of the so called UFO sightings. I know this, it was no optical illusion as it was a solid object. It was not any of the usual kind aircraft with wings etc.. as this object had nothing protruding out of its shell.
