Mute, flying object shoots straight up into the sky, then falls back down to leave the same way it came.;2004-11-15 22:00:00;1.5 Minutes;Mute, flying object shoots straight up into the sky, then falls back down to leave the same way it came. I was standing outside of my house around 22:00 and noticed this flying object getting closer and closer to me. It wasn't flying very fast, and slowed down even more when it was right above my head I could not hear a single sound of an engine or sound waves of any kind.  All of a sudden, it picked up speed and raised its altitude quite jurastically, almost like a roller coaster ride...just straight up. When I thought it was long gone, it came back down in the same exact path as it had gone up. It returned to the same position above my headm then left again, in the same path as it had come(NW). At that point, I had no idea what I had just seen.  I ran into the house to see if someone could come out fast enough to witness what I had just seen. Sure enough when I got back outside, it was long gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
