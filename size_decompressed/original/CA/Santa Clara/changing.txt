It sped off at a teriffic speed, changing size and color.;1997-06-08 15:00:00;appx  2 min;It sped off at a teriffic speed, changing size and color. When I was returning from a local disposal site, upon reaching the top of an overpass, an object caught my eye off to the left. It was hovered at a very low altitude appx. 500 ft. It was angled on it's side about 30 degrees, it's shape looked like a HIGH HAT. It sat there for about 2 min. Upon viewing it, it was black in color with a silver perimeter, it had a saucer plate bottom, inside of the plate was black and the perimeter was again silver. On the top hat portion off to the left side midway up, there seems to be a shape of a door, or a square window. The distance was 1 mile or less, it was about forty ft. across, and about 50 ft. in height. It sat in a southwesterly dircetion, when it sped off, it left in the same direction. As it left at a terrfic speed, it changed color to white, and size to a ball. The sky was all blue with few clouds, it left the atmosphere into the ionesphere and beyond within a mere few seconds. This took place in Santa Clara, Ca. I have seen other sightings more astounding than this one, dating back to 1967. The 1967 sighting was more detailed and astounding.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
Seven bright crafts ufo's seemed to dance in the Calif Sky last night;2012-03-08 19:35:00;2 minutes;Seven bright crafts ufo's seemed to dance in the Calif Sky last night Time was 19:35 pst   My mom and I were just looking att just how clear the night was and the north star was so very bright, and then whagt happened next was something that My mom and i have wanted to happen all our lives and it finally happened,   I real UFO sighting!!   We looked straight up and one craft was all alone and it was a very bright ball of light that looked like it had wings on it but they were'nt wings of course, but the had that appearance to them,   Like wings flashing made of light.  Then as we watched this craft travel from north to the south toward the Santa Cruz, Ca. mountains 6 others joined in from almost nowhere, they just lit up and then made shapes triangle, then what looked like the big dipper, and two of the seven kept joining together to make one and then broke apart again, as these 7 crafts flew away to the mountains they kind of made different shapes, like they were putting on a show for us.   We are very confused and unsure of how or just! what to feel.  We will never forget this event ever!!;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
