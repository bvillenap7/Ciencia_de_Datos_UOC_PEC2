Two of my friends and I were driving north on Pruneridge in Santa Clara in a bronco with its back shell removed. I was lying in the back seat looking up at the stars. I noticed a teardrop shaped object above me, there were no bright or blinking lights, just a orange gold glint (about the same color as the streetlights). I yelled to my friends to look at what at what at I was seeing, after a bit of yelling, my friend who was in the front passenger side came back to where I was and saw the UFO as well. When my friend in the back with me announces he could see it too, my friend who was driving pulled over. The UFO hung above us for about 5 sec. more, and then zoomed away South-East.
