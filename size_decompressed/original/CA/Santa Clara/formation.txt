I saw what looked like three shiny round pellets suspended in the air somewhat perpendicular to each other giving the appearance that they were right on top of each other. There was a fourth object that was shaped like a cone pointed downward. This cone object was just below the three shiny round objects. This gave the overall visual image like that of holding a tripple snow cone up in the air. Near the bottom pointed end of the cone object there was a constant flash of light like that of a kodak camera when taking a snap shot. This would flash every 3 seconds. There was also the impression that the cone was spinning because of shadows and reflections that could be seen. The four objects came descending rapidly from high altitude. They were at first shiny specs in the sky and then within less than a minute I could see the details of the object getting more and more clearer as they descended. They were about the size of buck shot at half arms length. An airliner passed below the objects. After the plane passed below the objects, they began to quickly ascend and soon dissappeared in the morning sky. There was no sound other than the airliner that took off from the nearby airport.;37.3620362258955;-121.963458402204
