Silent disk in afternoon daylight with over twenty witnesses;1979-10-01 16:00:00;20 minutes;Silent disk in afternoon daylight with over twenty witnesses I was about 15 at the time, it was in the early afternoon and alot of teenagers and other adults used to hang out on the our street after school. We were all talking when someone shouted What is that? We all looked towards the west. The major streets were Pacific Coast Highway and Cypress in Southwestern Lomita. To the west is PCH and Crenshaw Blvd in Torrance. The craft was a disk about fifty feet across and was traveling from west to east towards Los Angeles harbor. It made no sound and had no lights. It was traveling very slow, maybe 10 mph. it was approxiamately 500 feet away at an altitude of 100 feet. Everyone started running up the street and watched it cross over the small foothills of Palos Verdes and continue traveling east. It was an incredible sighting with alot of witnesses. A few days later at the store i overheard other local residences talking about it.Torrance airport is less than a mile away and very busy. The tower had to have seen this thing.;33.7908;-118.3248
