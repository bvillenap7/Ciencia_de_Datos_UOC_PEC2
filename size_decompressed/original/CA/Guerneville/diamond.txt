At first i figured it was just a plane high in the sky, but then realized that it wasn't traveling in a straight line nor moving at one speed.  Plus it had no sound.  The object would move down, then stop and hold its position.  it did this a few times until it made it down to i'd say about 500ft. and about 1 mile from me.  It then hovered up and down in a line for a few minutes, before lowering behind tall trees out of my view.  As it got closer to me i noticed that it had 5 lights.  3 bright whites in a triangle and 2 dim colored lights on the top and bottom.  It was a long time ago but i remember it well.  I've always wondered if anyone else had seen this object.  Thats what compelled me to report this old sighting.  you never know.  I do have another witness to prove i'm not crazy.
