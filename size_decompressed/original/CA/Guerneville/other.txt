I was having a smoke and watching the aerial antics of two Osprey fighting with a pair of crows above me.  As the Osprey gained the upper hand and chased the crows to the west, behind a stand of redwood trees, I saw a flash as if one of the Osprey had become brilliantly illuminated by the sun.  As I watched I realized that what I was seeing was not a bird, it appeared on that perfectly clear day in a brilliant blue sky to be nothing more than a strangely ovoid shaped cloud-lit a pale white.  I watched for a moment as the cloud moved across the sky in an unerring straight line. The cloud appeared to the west at between 30 and 45 degrees elevation and proceeded along a northern path gradually diminishing in size until I could track it no longer.  My friend came outside just as the object had decreased to the size of a pencil tip and could not see it even as I pointed out it's location.  When it first appeared it was perfectly visible and had a relative size of three inches in length from my point of view.  I cannot estimate the distance exactly due to uneven terrain and obstructed views but my best guess is that the altitude of the object was less than 20,000 feet and moving at a moderate rate of speed.  The entire sighting took only a few minutes before the object vanished from view in the distance. There was no sound or other effects associated with the object, no contrails or other emmissions were visible and no deviation was made from a straight path.;38.5026;-122.9932
