Saw 50 or more craft, flying West toward the coast. Silent, with blue lights glowing from underside of craft. Woke up suddenly and went out onto our deck through the sliding glass doors from our badroom. Looked up through redwoods, and saw 50 or more craft flying west. The craft looked like three disks connected with a thin bar, creating a triangle shape. The underside of the craft emminated a beautiful blue glow, and no sound was heard from where I stood, about 2 miles from the hill they were all flying over. They were moving very slowly. For some reason, instead of continuing to watch them, I went back to bed before they had moved out of my vision. I attempted to wake my husband to show him, but I curiously could not! Nothing would wake him. It seems as if someone else would have seen this, as it was such a large amount of craft that I saw.;38.5026;-122.9932

They were far away, but each one would have been as bright as a stadium lit-up at night, and this was in broad daylight.  They weren't connected, I could see some sky between them and they drifted apart a bit after just hovering motionlessly.  I watched them for a while and then walked past a tree which blocked my view of them, when I looked again, they were gone, just vanished.;38.5026;-122.9932
