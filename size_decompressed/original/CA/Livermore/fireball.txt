It exploded three times getting larger each time. Them it swept  to the west (parallel to Hwy 580w) and I saw a long red hot tail (which appeared as if millions of small pieces of red all grouped together and emitting from the bright green fire ball)at least four times the size of the fireball which continued to glow and appeared to soar north (north of 580) before dropping out of sight. I see a lot of shooting stars but I was in awe to see this,  I wasn't sure if it was a rocket or meteorite or some sort of vehicle breaking through the stratosphere..it lasted a long time.   I searced the newspapers, but found nothing mentioned regarding it. Though, I'm sure the Lab must have had it in it's radar. I am a fifty year old female, and have been seeing ufos for years, but never something glowing so brightly.. was it a shooting star VERY close? I'm not so certain.

I witness and videotaped about 8 fireballs traveling north across Livermore Ca.;2012-07-31 21:50:00;1 minute;At the time and date stated above I witness and videotaped about 8 fireballs traveling north across Livermore Ca.  Driving south on Springtown Rd towards 580 I noticed them about 1/4 mile south  from where I was.  By the time I found a safe place to park so that I could video them, they appeared just above me.  Then one by one the turn east towards the wind farm. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
Saw a large ball of light traveling West to East in Livermore.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD));2016-07-27 21:37:00;30 seconds;Saw a large ball of light traveling West to East in Livermore. A large, bright light was traveling fast from West to East in a smooth trajectory, but seemed to be falling.  It had a trail of some kind, such as what you see come out of a jet.  There were no lights on it and it seemed to be burning.  There was no sound associated with it.    My husband and I have seen meteorites and satellites, but nothing this large and bright.   We were afraid that it would land nearby and cause damage of some kind, as it appeared to be under the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD));37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
