Twin cylinder object in broad daylight over California;2008-01-09 15:50:00;60 seconds;Twin cylinder object in broad daylight over California On the afternoon of January 9th, I stepped outside in the shade to be picked up for a meeting.  It was 4:58, and as I waited I watched an airplane prepare to land as it flew overhead.  I live on a flight path and as I watched the plane at 2,000 feet traveling west, I caught the glimmer of an object much higher up above the landing plane heading east.  The sun was in a position to clearly reflect light from the object.  It looked silver with two cylinders attached.  There was a dark band between the two cylinders.  There was no noise, no vapor trail, and no perturbation of its straight flight path. It traveled from the northwest to southeast at a very high altitude.  Because I was in the shadows and the object was in the sunlight, I had a very good view of it.  I watched the object for a number of seconds and it was gone in less than a minute.  I looked on the web for similar sightings and found a near identical Italian sighting (SanRemo, Italy 9-29-2006, 20:08).  Thus, did anyone see a similar object at approximately the same time?;37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
Two craft over Northern California, traveling at a high rate of speed, chasing each other, with no sound.;2015-06-24 22:10:00;30 seconds;Two craft over Northern California, traveling at a high rate of speed, chasing each other, with no sound. The first object appeared from the northwest and was flying in a large S pattern.  The object was approximately 10,000ft in altitude and made no sound.  The object was cylinder in shape with lights on each end.  This object was traveling at a high rate of speed. As the craft moved away toward the south continuing its S flight path another craft appear from the same direction and appeared to be chasing the first one.  The second craft was very large with four lights in a diamond pattern.  This aircraft was also very low and moving at a very fast rate of speed. The most amazing aspect of this sighting was the first craft made no sound and the second craft made a low humming sound that was barely audible.  Any objects flying at that speed traditionally make a loud sound trail.;37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
