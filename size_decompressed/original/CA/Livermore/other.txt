A star-like object inscribed rectangles in the sky and then vanished!.;1998-07-07 21:00:00;4 Minutes+-;A star-like object inscribed rectangles in the sky and then vanished!. I have avoided telling this for fear of ridicule.  Even my wife is not aware.  If it ever gets out, I will be an outcast!  But I know what I saw.  At about 9PM on the 7th of July, 1998 while watching TV, I heard what sounded like a distant explosion. Seemed to have come from the Southeast (toward my back-yard).  Thinking it might be some illicit fireworks left over from the 4th (fireworks are VERBOTEN in California), I stepped out into the back yard to watch.  I saw some 4 or 5 more explosions (rockets) with the traditional red-white-blue streamers coming down.  After the 4th or 5th rocket there was a long pause.  I didn't know if that was the last rocket or not so I just waited.  While I was waiting I glanced around the sky.  It was very clear and the stars were bright.  Looking up at about a 45 degree angle to the North, I saw a particularly bright star which I glanced at for a second or two and moved on to other stars.  But before it was out of my field of view, I caught a movement and I glanced back. Thinking it might be a satellite, I continued to watch as it slowly moved toward the south. But, After 15 or 20 seconds it made a sharp 90 degree turn!  Then at about 30 to 45 seconds more another 90 degree turn!  As I watched, it inscribed a perfect rectangle.  It made almost 2 complete trips in this rectangular pattern while I watched.  I estimated it took about 2 minutes to complete a rectangular trip, and made approximately two of these trips while I watched.  Then there was a split second when it streaked off at about a 45 degree angle which led away from the rectangle it had been making.  In about 1/10th of a second the light just went out.  That was the last I saw of it.;37.712136312849;-121.767096089386

Something caught my eye that at first glance looked like a street lamp from atop one of those long poles. However, when I looked again, I realized it was not attached to any pole, so I looked very closely at this object. It was suspended in the air - not moving. So immediately I began to see if it were a blimp. It was not. It was gigantic. It was a metallic dark blue on the top two thirds of it with black gigantic rectangular picture type windows on it where the narrow part of the rectangle was at the top and the long part was down the sides insetted into the craft a bit. The bottom one-third of it was a silverish-grey color with no markings. The object was shaped similar to a street lamp and tilted down slightly toward the ground. It was about a mile off the ground, but seven miles from my location. It was huge. Everyone on highway 580 must have seen it.  I drove my car to an area to so that I could view it better which was about three minutes later, I saw what appeared to be this craft 'shimmer' for a second and disappear right there in mid air. No movement was recorded and no sound was noticed at this great distance. I drove to the nearby airport to see if there were any blimps of that kind in and around that area and viewed none. I drove a distance of seven miles looking for this craft, to no avail.;37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
Flying objects over the Livermore Valley;2011-03-22 02:00:00;25min.;Flying objects over the Livermore Valley See these every night and hear whirring sound too!  Appears to be star like but have seen one fly over, about a thousand feet up.  This has been going on since the year 2005.  When I first started using my telescope. I started seeing things in the sky all the time.  So I flashed them with a flashlight and they have flashed back and seem to know when I'm looking.  I hear them all the time, day and night.  I started using a laser light and they move very fast, when I find them.  The first time I used the laser, one was going away from my direction. I hit it with the laser and it turned so quick and started enlarging back in my direction. So I flashed my flash light, my two blinks, real quick and it started going away.  That one that flew over me in the early morning sunrise.  Really looked me over, then flew straight toward Orion, which was very visible.  I really had so much fear in me when I started but, now I'm so used to them. I saw one in the fifties when I was about 9 or 10, a jet was chasing it and my stepfather, a USAF Sargent was standing next to me.  I'm in Awe!  They cloak and their speed and turns.   Well had to talk to someone about it because, wife and child don't believe me. Descriptions of all that I have seen, range from small orbs flying through the back yard, one triangular, one huge saucer to star like and sometimes a hazy movement going very fast.  I know difference between satellites too! I'm a night person.  I love sitting on my stool with my large binoculars on tripod looking up to a very starry night, well for the Bay Area. I have seen so much at night.  I just don't have the space to write it all down. I want so much to ask my neighbors if they know whats going on above their houses but, they probably already think I'm crazy with all the flashing[lights]at night around my house from me.  I just can't believe that no one saw the Orion ship [it, as I said flew just up over our houses]. Believing Retired Sky watcher of the 5Th kind;37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
