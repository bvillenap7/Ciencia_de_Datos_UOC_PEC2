3 people clearly see large saucer shaped object 1/2 mile away;1980-05-05 18:00:00;5 minutes;3 people clearly see large saucer shaped object 1/2 mile away We were traveling South on N. Livermore Ave heading towards Portola Avenue.  I was in the passengers seat and spotted a saucer shaped object, about 1/2 mile away and 1/2 mile up in the sky. It was stationary.   It was unobstructed.  Clear as could be.  Silver in color with many lights circling around the middle.  It made no noise.  We pulled over, got out of the car and stared at it. I would say it was roughly 50 yards long and 20 yards high. The colors seemed to be unfamiliar. After just sitting in one place for 4 minutes it moved, at an angle, about 1 mile away, in 1/2 a second.  Still no noise.  It moved about 3 more times, faster than anything I have ever seen, even to this day.  Finally it sped away and was out of sight in 1 second. After it left someone said to not say a word, that we should drive back home and each write down what we saw. SO, we did.  And without communicating a word regarding what we saw, we each wrote down the exact same thing. We were never scared and it didn't appear to notice us. It was clearly something from somewhere else.

simple silver disk, moved at amazing speeds;2002-08-01 16:00:00;10 minutes;simple silver disk, moved at amazing speeds My stepfather was always a skeptic as far as UFO's went, he always figured they were U.S. military craft or meteorlogical phenomenon.  One afternoon in the summer of 2002 he called me out to the back porch.  He already had the binoculars out and handed them to me.  He pointed to a spot in the sky and said what do you think that is?  I looked through the binoculars and saw a silver disk shaped craft maybe 40-50ft in diameter.There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft.   When I took the binoculars away from my eyes I could see the object hovering maybe a half mile off and about 300 ft off the ground.  I started to look at it through the binoculars again and in a few moments it disappeared.  At that same moment my stepfather said where did it go?   I quickly looked around the sky and saw the object 15 miles away over the city of Pleasanton.  My stepfathers response was we can't have anything that can do that.  The objects dissapeared again and we never saw it again.   My stepfather passed away last year, but at least he got to see a real UFO.   He was never the same after that day, and he had started to consider the link between extraterrestrials and the history of the human race.  I loved him and I will miss him and I'm glad we were able to share this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
