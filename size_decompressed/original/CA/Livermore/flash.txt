I was outside on our deck three nights ago when I first noticed the lights. It was a round sort of ball of flashing lights.  I asked my friends if they were seeing it as well, and they were.  The lights stayed in one spot for three nights now, and didn't move at all.  At first I assumed it was a satellite, but tonight as I was looking directly at them, they just vanished WAIT, they were gone for maybe ten minutes as i started writing this, but now they're back in the exact same spot as before but there's a light shining down from the bottom of it.  A beam of light if you will. I have cold chills telling that actually.  The lights just vanished.  They flashed from a red to white to sometimes green. The red was very dominant though.  I sat outside and looked up at it for like I said three nights without them moving one time.  The lights were coming from over a hill so I also ruled that it was a cell tower maybe, but after I tought about that I realized that there was no cell towers of any kind in that direction.;37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
