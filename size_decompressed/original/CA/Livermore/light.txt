Strange light that shrunk and disapeared;2002-12-03 17:05:00;5 minutes;Strange light that shrunk and disapeared I was outside. I saw this weird white light in the sky. It wasn't a star because the stars don't come out for a while. It wasn't an airplane because it was too high. I told my brother and my friend to come outside and look at it. It was slowly moving south. The object had some glowing around it. It made no noise. Then, about 5 minutes later, it shrunk and disapeared without a trace. It could have been a flare, but I don't think it was. I wanted to tape the object, but the picture wouldn't come out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

Space battle in the eastern sky?;2003-11-22 02:30:00;> 1 hour;Space battle in the eastern sky? There is one main light, which at first glance looks like a very bright star.  It's in the eastern sky, about 35 degrees above the horizon.   But it's darting around very quickly.  It appears to be very far away, perhaps in orbit.  At times, it apears to be triangular in shape.  If you look carefully, many very faint, barely discernable points of light are streaking, swarming near the large object.  Looks like a veritable space battle, with the larger object dodging the many smaller objects.  After viewing for an hour, the scene has tracked with the stars in the background.   Yet, the object would indeed have to be darting extremely fast to be so far away… ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly the star Sirius, we suspect.  PD));37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
The  bright  light stayed there for 5 minites than took off extermly  fast and vanished.;2004-02-29 21:30:00;5 min.;The  bright  light stayed there for 5 minites than took off extermly  fast and vanished. As I was sitting in my backyard I was looking at the stars to the east of my position. I noticed what I thougt was one of the planets that has been in the sky lately. I was looking at it for roughly 5 minites tring to figure out which plant it was, it than moved very fast to the south and faded out of view. I tried to reason what it could have been and given the facts, that it was as bright as one of the planets that I've been watching, staying in the same place for at least 5 minites, then taking off at a very high rate of speed there's no queston in my mind that it was a UFO. It was a extremly clear night here on the west coast in northern Californa.I could not make out a shape because of how high it was in the sky. I could only see the very bright white light.;37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
White light flying high over Livermore Valley near Sandia/Lawrence Livermore Lab;2005-10-08 22:00:00;20 sec.;White light flying high over Livermore Valley near Sandia/Lawrence Livermore Lab This may seem a little mundane.   But I've seen these many times in the night's sky since February of this year(2005).  I also want to mention that I live about 3 miles away from Sandia/Lawrence Livermore Lab.   It was only a white light moving across the night sky.  The thing that caught my eye, was the fact that it was moving very erratically.   I know how a plane moves. Very predictable. This was darting left, pause, and then right, Over and over again as it was going from west to east across the sky.  I believe this object and all the other's that I've seen are in the stratosphere and or near space.  It's hard to tell the size.  It all depends how far out they are. If you've ever seen a satillite, it's very close to looking like that.  The difference is, when I was younger in the 1980's, they used to arc very predictably across the sky. These do appear like a dot of light in the heavens, except that these things tac like a boat would if you wanted to turn on the open sea. Left-Right-Left-Right.   The object I saw tonight though was moving so extreme I felt compelled to report it.  If you've ever seen any video of how these things move, you know what I'm talking about.  My background: I've been a Machinist for over a decade. I have a 4 year old daughter.  I'm just a private citizen whose interested in the paranormal.;37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
Strange light in the sky over Livermore CA.;2005-10-13 20:05:00;2 min;Strange light in the sky over Livermore CA. I was walking away from a sports practice with my son and several other people.   We saw the object in the western sky at about 45 degree elevation.  It appeared to us to not be that far away.   I called the local airport to see if they had gotten any other reports, but they had not.   The object was exibiting a non ballistic flight pattern.  Up, down, left, right but primarily moving from south to north.   It was a bright orange color, not blinking.  Even though I know alot about planes and hellicopters, I don't know how I would explain this motion.   I am a bit of a skeptic, I don't usually believe in this sort of stuff.  The thing that sealed it for me was the fact that the object changed from bright orange to electric blue for a few seconds then back to orange.  It did this several times during its transit of the sky which lasted 2 or 3 min.  This color change along with the non ballistic flight really puzzled me.  I have no idea what we saw.   Some background:  I also saw the same thing in the early summer around 10:00pm one evening.  No color change that time, but non ballistic flight.  My son also told me he and his friends saw the same object several weeks earlier. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Me and three other friends where out in a large pitch black field playing Airsoft wile standing around I pointed out a blue/white light traveling about north, 20 degrees west at a fairly low altitude. The light was fairly close with absolutely no sound. It suddenly appeared, and was at a speed faster than a private single prop engine plane, probably about 300-320MPH. It traveled for about 4-5 seconds before the light made a pulse and shot straight up 90 degrees at at least 1000MPH. Another minute or so, wile observing the sky, we spotted the same object/light at an extreme altitude. Probably in the uper atmosphere or higher. We watched it travel for about 4 seconds in the opposite direction before vanishing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I observed a bright object in the sky traveling erratically.  90 seconds;2010-10-14 21:25:00;90 seconds;I observed a bright object in the sky traveling erratically.  90 seconds Details. On the night of 14 October 2010 I observed an unusual object in the sky.  I have been an amateur astronomer for over 40 years and had setup my 8-inch Newtonian reflector telescope for viewing the night sky.  After aligning my telescope with the polar axis, I started to observe the night sky (it was a clear night for viewing). I had already observed the planet Jupiter and the first quarter moon when I decided to train my telescope on the celestial object M-31 (the galaxy in the constellation Andromeda). As I moved my telescope toward the area of M-31 I noticed a brief flash of light near the star Beta Andromedae.  At first, I thought I had caught a glimpse of a meteor, however, a few seconds later the object reappeared near the northeast corner of the “Great Square” of Pegasus.  When it reappeared it was moving in a southern direction. I was going to change my assessment that this bright object was probably a satellite, but I then noticed it had a reddish-copper like halo around it. I then noted the time on my watch as 21:25. Location and Description of Object.  At this time of year in northern California, the constellations Andromeda and Pegasus are approximately 45 to 50 degrees above the northeastern horizon.  The object itself appeared to be a white star in appearance.  The halo was about the same brightness and was the size of a dime (if you held a dime in your hand and fully extended your arm).  As I will mention later this object varied in brightness. In astronomical terms it changed from between a magnitude 1.5 down to a magnitude of 4.0.  The object also faded away (or disappeared) a total of three times. Movement and Behavior of Object.  As this object moved south, it appeared to be behaving like a satellite.  However, the object made a “loop” in the sky.  The best way to describe objects movement is imaging drawing a straight line then writing a small letter “L” and then continuing the line for a short distance.  The loop would be the size of my thumb when held at arm’s length. After the object looped it dimmed briefly for a few seconds but then got brighter again.  This is when it made sudden move south through Pegasus at high speed and made a another “loop” before stopping and fading from view near the ecliptic just east of Jupiter (this rapid movement occurred in just two to three seconds).  After another few seconds, the object reappeared and continued south at the pace of a satellite.  But once again, as it neared the star Fomalhaut in the southern hemisphere, it made another loop and dimmed again from view.  It would reappear one more time and head south and I would lose the object  in the sky glow near the southern horizon.  I looked at my watch and it flipped from 21:26 to 21:27.  So the length of the event I estimate to be between 60 to 90 seconds. Conclusion. The only way I can relate the object to anything else is it looked like a moving “ring-type” nebula.  As I mentioned before I have an amateur astronomer for over 40 years and have never see anything like this. I you have an explanation to what I saw I would enjoy hearing it.  I hope this information helps.;37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
Red Lights/Orbs in formation over downtown Livermore - New Years Eve 2014.;2014-01-01 00:10:00;3-5 minutes;Red Lights/Orbs in formation over downtown Livermore - New Years Eve 2014 Went out to smoke.  Saw over downtown (First Street Alehouse area) 5-7 orange/red lights/orbs circling in formation upwards one after another and out of sight towards the South.  I thought they may have been quad copter drones maybe Police or enthusiasts.   The formation was a little tight though and they did disappear out of sight, and I know the radio controlled drones have a limited range.  The sky was clear.  Stars were visible.   Im writing this report right now because I have just read online this occurred all over California, at approx the same time in multiple locations...  Interesting, to say the least.;37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
I noticed two white lights next to each other floating in the sky.  Didn't move just hovered. ((anonymous report));2018-05-24 21:30:00;5 minutes;Driving passenger I noticed two white lights next to each other floating in the sky.  Didn't move just hovered. I started to record it, it then moved quickly across the sky and stopped again.  It was going in the same direction as we were traveling so I was able to watch it.  It then disappeared in the sky.  It didn't have a shape from what I could see, however my boyfriend and son both saw it as well.  So weird!! Kinda creepy… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact  information.  PD));37.712136312849;-121.767096089386
