Large bright orange moon looking object hovers over mountains near sutter yuba countys.;2010-01-15 01:00:00;30;Large bright orange moon looking object hovers over mountains near sutter yuba countys. The cabin i was living in was on a high mountain range overlooking the yuba river sutter county area. Coming from behind the trees, i thought wow what bright big orange moon we have tonight. As it came around the trees and was now in clear veiw over the moutain ridge i begab to realize this was not the moon. It was much too close. It stayed in same place for several minutes. It began to move around in different directions like it was dancing. It was pulsating. It seperated into several lights as it moved further away towards yuba city area. It looked like the moutain in the distance was on fire. Then it flickered out like a fire and disappeared. It never dawned on me to grab the camera until after it had disappeared. It was there for about 30 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.3793;-121.0929
