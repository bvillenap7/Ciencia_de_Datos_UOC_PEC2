Three lights in triangular formation;2002-08-06 21:30:00;4 min;Three lights in triangular formation We saw three lighted objects traveling SSE in a triangular formation that appeared low over the Sierra crest. They remained at about the same overall altitude slightly changing in their formation. The object to the left had a blinking red light on its left side that would stay on for a second and off for a couple of seconds. We looked at the objects through good binoculars and could not see a defined shape, just light. There was no sound.;37.407;-119.7284
