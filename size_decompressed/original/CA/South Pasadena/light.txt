Stopped, and then moved away from me VERY fast and then just disappeared This was a very very bright circular light seen in the morning sky, just a few minutes before sunrise.  It was a beautiful clear morning and they sky was unusually light.  The brightness caught my eye as I was driving.  At first I thought it was a helicopter but the light then got much more intense with a reddish glow around it.  It then seemed to move backwards away from me extremely fast and then completely vanished.  I knew it could not be a helicopter because you don't see the helicopter headlight if it is moving away from you, and it moved way too fast.;34.1082;-118.1569
