At first it looked like an escape balloon, but it was too far away and too large.  It was shaped like one of those dolphin balloons, which gave me my first clue.  It was wobbling from side to side, and heading East.  After a little bit, it dissapeared behind some trees.  Even after we repositioned ourselves, it was out of sight.  It just dissappeared.
