Slow white spheres almost like stars during the day;2019-10-06 17:00:00;5 minutes;Slow white spheres almost like stars during the day I was outside in the backyard with my kids this past Sunday when I saw these white spheres floating across the sky.  Probably balloons...but looked pretty cool almost like slow moving stars during the dayâ€¦  They seemed to be moving against the wind but who knows...hoping you could share!  Thanks!    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAw86r0s0ks&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR1W06yOSzees-jTT2eWYT7_D12CUC4kkrEePZVym5rCQZqzfH_NaotNEkg;34.1082;-118.1569
