UFO Sighted in Central California - Dos Palos.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  PD));2005-11-14 19:08:00;1 hr 13 minutes;UFO Sighted in Central California - Dos Palos I saw what I thought was a star, but it kept getting bigger and bigger.  It was lower than the clouds, so I knew then that it was not a star.  I looked with the binoculars and it was getting closer and when it didn't seem that it was getting closer, it started to go lower and lower towards Interstate 5 by Los Banos, California.  I checked the internet for UFO sightings and there was a photo of what I exactly had seen.  I have been seeing this light everyday for about a month already.  I have included the web address of the photo I mentioned. I am 37 yrs of age and have worked for the Internal Revenue Service for over 13 years. So I am not crazy. http://www.ufoevidence.org/photographs/section/post2000/Photo203.htm ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  PD));37.0034;-120.6273
