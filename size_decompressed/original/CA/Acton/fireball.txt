While driving westbound on I14 from Acton I saw green ball of light move across the sky from my upper left to my lower right view through the windshield. The fireball was visable for 3 seconds , was a light luminous green in color and traveled in a slight arc towards the ground.  It disappeared behind a mountain with no noticable impact indicators.  This was consistant with the other three green fireballs I saw last fall while driving in this area. This is a suburb about 30 miles north of Los Angeles in the mountains so sky conditions are good enough to see the Milky Way. Approximate size was a sixteenth inch in diameter at arms length. I have a very technical background in electronics, optics, photography and astronomy. I am quite familiar with the air traffic routes and seeing objects in the night sky.  This was definitly not a plane, a jet, a weather ballon :-), a crash test dummy :-), a typical meteor, an orbiting satellite although it might have been a part of one.;34.4857;-118.192
