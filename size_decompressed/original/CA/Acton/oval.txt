White beam of light came down from orange light, then went back up into orange light.  Orange light then slowly got smaller until it disappeared. I was traveling south on the 14 fwy thru Acton, CA around midnight in August 1997.  An oblong shaped, orange light appeared and was traveling south above and across the freeway.  (Since it was nighttime it was hard to tell how far away the light way.)  During this whole episode which only lasted about 20 seconds, the orange light was moving.....  A beam of white light came down from the orange light, then slowly went BACK UP into the orange light.  It was not a spotlight that is bigger at the bottom like from a helicopter...it was a thin, straight BEAM of light.  The light did not fade out or turn off....it went BACK UP into the orange light.  Then the orange light while still moving south slowly got smaller and smaller until it was just a pinpoint and then it disappeared.
