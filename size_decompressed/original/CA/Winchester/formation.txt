Driving through the neighborhood north/northwest we saw approximately two dozen lights, in formation, slowly descending. It’s possible the lights were connected to one craft or several different crafts in formation. They were similar to an isosceles triangle with a wide base and short sides. We also noticed what appeared to be several aircraft heading toward the object or near it. I made my girlfriend stop the car (in the middle of the road) so I could snap a photo. She, a pragmatist, could only explain the phenomenon as a “drone show”. I snapped a photo but failed to realize the flash was on, and the photo does not do the sighting justice.;33.6206;-117.0867
