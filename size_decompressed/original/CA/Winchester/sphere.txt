two stars rotating tightly together as they fell slowly not a min later the direction slightly changed and it looked as if it projected;2011-01-04 21:45:00;more than five mins;my girlfriend had pointed out the window to the sky and asked if i could see what looked to be the north star in the wrong direction.it looked stationary at first glance to looking as if it was a meteor burning up. but it slowed down and slowly started to look as if it was two stars rotating tightly together as they fell slowly not a min later the direction slightly changed and it looked as if it projected 3-4  single orange tear drops down faster than the orbs were moving which lasted maybe a split second with a couple seconds between each teardrop. after the 3-4 teardrops the orbs changed back to it original fall direction as the two rotating orbs rotating pattern started to slow as it looked like they slightly spread exposing a glimse of white light and then flickerd as one shape for about a min and disapeared. whole experience was 5-6 minutes.;33.6206;-117.0867
