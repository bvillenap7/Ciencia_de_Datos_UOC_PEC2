BLACK DISTINCT V SHAPE HOVERING, CHANGED TO BALL SHAPE AND CREPT ACROSS SKY;2005-02-27 16:50:00;APPX 7 MIN;BLACK DISTINCT V SHAPE HOVERING, CHANGED TO BALL SHAPE AND CREPT ACROSS SKY NOTICED A BLACK HOVERING CRAFT 1 HAND ABOVE HORIZON, NNW, PARTLY CLOUDY SKY. INITIAL THOUGHT WAS A HELICOPTER, THEN IT TURNED, LOOKING ALMOST LIKE A FLOCK OF BIRDS, CLOSER LOOK DETERMINED IT TO BE TOO BIG. REALIZING THAT IT WASN'T MOVING. GOT BINOCULARS, SAW A VERY DISTINCT V SHAPE. WITH HARD EDGES. IT WENT BEHIND A CLOUD AND REAPPEARED AS A BALL. THEN SLOWLY CREPT ACROSS THE SKY IN AN STRAIGHT NORTH ROUTE. OBSERVED UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.;33.6206;-117.0867
