Numerous blue flashing dots in sky moving in sky.;2012-07-04 22:00:00;40 minutes;Numerous blue flashing dots in sky moving in sky. Many strange moving blue lights in the sky that moved across the sky in a arch over time.  Started out with smaller numbers than it seemed to increase in numbers and file into a line over a large portion of the sky, blinking irregularly.  They then congregated once again moving about irregularly.  They were gone after I went inside for 20 minutes.;38.5151;-122.4622
St Helena CA sighting (flash of light across the horizon);2013-09-10 20:00:00;1 second;St Helena CA sighting (flash of light across the horizon) Was laying in the park after a workout (stars are very bright in this region at night).  Was looking at falling stars when something flashed completely across the horizon...must have been going mach 10.  Couldn't have been a shooting star since it flew left to right (and fairly low), not up and down.  It flew by in a blink of an eye.  I wasn't alarmed since this is my second sighting (my first was in 2009).  I'm fascinated by this phenomenon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));38.5151;-122.4622
