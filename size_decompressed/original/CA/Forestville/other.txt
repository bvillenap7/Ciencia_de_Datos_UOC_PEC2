The color dropped off in a gradient, brightest in the center and progressively dimmer towards the boundary of the diamond shape. The diamond shape was thinner in width than in height. It hovered, and moved non-linearly. The size was approximately the diameter of a cigarette at arms length. While I was watching the object, I had a feeling like I knew where it was going to move, or that it was moving in such a way as to manifest my expectations. At this point I got very agitated, and went into the next room to wake up a friend. By the time we looked out the window I could no longer see the object anywhere in the sky. by this time it was about 12 or 12:01 am 3-7-01. I am a student at the local junior college majoring in mathematics. I know enough physics to know that this object wasn't using standard principals of aerodynamic lift, at least as we know them.;38.4986;-122.8988
