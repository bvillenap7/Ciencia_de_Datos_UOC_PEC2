My encounter with a Flying Saucer hovering over the moutains of Northern Californa in 1985.;1985-06-01 17:30:00;20 to 30 sec;My encounter with a Flying Saucer hovering over the moutains of Northern Californa in 1985. It happened about 5:00 to 5:30 p.m. on a clear Ca. sky on top of a moutain. My friend and I just got into a old style hot tub when a wierd feeling cameover me and I happened to look out over the horizon to see a saucer shaped aircraft hovering at about 500 yds or so. It was a shiny silver color and was prefectly areodynamic. It had two lights on it that would spin around the sharp middle part to where they would hit each other and bounce back and forth. It made a light humming sound like the sound of electricity flowing. The UFO moved very slightly left than right a few times and in a flash it was gone. I know what I saw and it was NOT an aircraft I've ever seen before or now. I currently work on F-15 eagles for the government. I've never, until today, told anyone but my wife and family about my experience. I think it's time to find out what I saw was military or alien.;38.4986;-122.8988
