Two lights in eastern sky.;2003-09-04 21:00:00;3 min;Two lights in eastern sky. Friday,09/05/2003    On Thursday September 4,2003,four of us saw a big green ball of what looked like fire in the sky. Location was in Forestville CA, in the eastern sky. We were talking about what we saw to my friends husband , when we saw another light in the sky, also in the east. This one was a white light. The light  was bigger than a helicopter or an airplane light. The planet mars was in the sky to the far right. In comparison to size the green ball and the white light was double the size to mars. The ball was traveling south. Movement was slower than a shooting star. The white light was moving very slow. Location was just to the left of where the ball was, it went left, then seemed to go up real slow, then looked like it was either moving in a west direction or east. Then it went straight up very fast, and then stopped, then it just disappeared.;38.4986;-122.8988
