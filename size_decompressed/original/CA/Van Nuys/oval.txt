Five shiny objects flying in formation over Van Nuys;2016-04-21 15:32:00;~30-60 seconds;Five shiny objects flying in formation over Van Nuys At 15:32 on April 21 (today) I was looking straight up into the sky and saw a couple of recent chemtrails stretching across the sky, a common experience. Then 5 shiny blue-green objects appeared in the sky, in close formation. I thought at first they were balloons, moving in a NW direction.  Though they were third-dimensional,  they were not perfectly spherical.  They were quite high up and I couldn’t see the detail.  I thought they might be drones, but not skinny at all.  Then it appeared that two of them emitted short white cloud-like “chemtrails,”  one each.  I watched these for a short time, floating in the wind.  They started to spread out as chemtrails do. UFO’s disappear. I looked away for no more than a second and when I looked back, the formation of 5 had disappeared completely.  They were nowhere in the sky. But the “chemtrails were still there, and started to change shape (as chemtrails never do  -- they just spread out.)  From the center of each a bulge formed.  One of the bulges drifted down, still connected, so the effect was that of a right angle.  The other bulge did not drift, but was more rounded than straight.    These small cloud-like formations lasted for a while before I went inside.  They were two high up to get a good picture.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
