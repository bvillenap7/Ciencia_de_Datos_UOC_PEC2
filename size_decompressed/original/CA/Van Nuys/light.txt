A light appeared in the sky over Van Nuys Golf Course, and then disappeared.;2000-01-18 18:30:00;1 minute;((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Vandenberg AFB at this time.)) A light appeared in the sky over Van Nuys Golf Course, and then disappeared. Two of us were golfing.  A light appeared above the course.  It emitted a very bright, unidirectional, white light that formed a pyramidal shape pointing downward.  From within this light, a blue streak extended from the light source to beyond the boundary of the white light.  This light hovered silently for approximately 1 minute.  The light then appeared to cave in upon itself until it disappeared, leaving a lingering, glowing blue streak in the sky, that appeared to drift with the wind.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617

Bright Red Light moving strangely over Van Nuys and then Bolting away fast.;2004-11-12 21:30:00;5 minutes;Bright Red Light moving strangely over Van Nuys and then Bolting away fast. Looked up at the sky, it and saw a BRIGHT reddish orange light that at first might have been a terrestrial aircraft, but the light moved slowly from north to south, then stopped, and the light stayed the same intensity as if it was not moving farther away. Made no noise, and then it started to very slowly move from south to north and a minute later DARTED from north to south at a VERY high rate of speed (faster than any aircraft I've ever seen) while blinking...it moved so fast it was almost like it was beyond the framerate of my eyes and kinda flickered and about 5-10 seconds later was beyond my field of view over the horizon.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
UFO delays launch of Taurus XL rocket form Vandenberg AFB.;2011-02-23 02:05:00;30 mins;UFO delays launch of Taurus XL rocket form Vandenberg AFB. I stayed up to watch the Taurus XL launch from Vandenberg Air Force base this morning 2/23/11. I have seen other launches from the roof of my condo complex.   From there I have an unobstructed view.  I am about 60 miles from the base but have no problem seeing the launches.  I set up my telescope and aimed in the general direction of where I have seen launches before.   I saw a light source over the exact spot of the direction that the base is located.  The light changed colors from red to green to yellow and orange.  I was able to see this light with the naked eye.  I was low on the horizon from my point of view.   It was a clear night.  I saw stars a lot higher in the sky and none were no where near the brilliance of the light I saw.  At first I thought it might be a helicopter or a plane but it stayed perfectly still.   I observed this craft for no less than 25 minutes (Between 2:05 and 2:30 am PST) while waiting for the launch which did not come.  Today I checked the Vandenberg AFB website to see if they had any info on the launch and right at the top of the website it said, 'Breaking news: Taurus XL launch delayed due to technical difficulties. The launch has been rescheduled for 02/24/11 2:09 am PST.  24 hours after the original launch date.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
Large Bright Red Orb/Light Over Van Nuys/Burbank.;2015-03-19 20:00:00;120 seconds;Large Bright Red Orb/Light Over Van Nuys/Burbank. While driving home noticed a VERY bright red light in sky towards Van Nuys or Burbank.   Kept an eye on it while I pulled onto my street.  It appeared to be moving and getting closer.   Got home and it was still there. Got out of car and continued to watch.  Bright Red Light was now hovering in place.  It appeared to be at low altitude, like one would see the LAPD helicopter.  But this had No noise nor did it have any of the other obvious helicopter indicators.   Then the light got small while it was hovering.  A moment later it was as if someone turned off the light.   Gone! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
Four lights in a line in the evening sky;2016-07-10 16:30:00;7-10 minutes;four lights in a line in the evening sky At approximately 8PM on the evening of July 10th 2016, witnessed, with two others, four lights in the western sky over the San Fernando Valley area of California. First observation was a close cluster of two green, a blue and a red light, blinking intermittently and relatively close to the ground - approximating 3/4 mile, at 75 degrees above the western horizon. The objects spread apart and actually seemed to move in a horizontal plane, while blinking. The lights were on a non-repetitive pattern and of uneven strength. We managed to obtain both still photos and video of the objects, as the illumination was quite bright, especially the green spectrum. First assertion was that the objects were balloons of some sort, as their lights diminished over time, ( perhaps 7 minutes) as if they were drifting higher and seemed to move with contrasting winds of various altitudes.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
