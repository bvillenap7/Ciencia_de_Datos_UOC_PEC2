Turquoise lights in the sky, followed each other in triangular formation. Incredibly fast moving. My dog began acting strange as if it was surrendering to the lights.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617

On Saturday 14, 2008 I was driving north on Hazeltine Blvd. in Van Nuys, CA.   I looked up looking north west and saw what I thought was a shooting star but it was so large and their were four straight lines that were white lights trailed by a comet like tail or burn off.   They were in line with each other and were traveling at a very fast speed.  They did not disappear like a shooting star would have they took off from south to north half way across the sky going at a downward direction and then disappeared.   I had 1 person in the car with me and he only saw the very end of it.  But also said he had never seen anything like that before.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
