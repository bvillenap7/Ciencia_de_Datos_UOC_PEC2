TWO METALLIC SPHERES, MOVING SOUTHEAST, APPROX 10-15 THOU FEET.;1978-08-01 12:00:00;20-30 SEC0NDS;TWO METALLIC SPHERES, MOVING SOUTHEAST, APPROX 10-15 THOU FEET. MY BROTHER AND I WERE IN THE BACK YARD OF OUR HOME.  WE HAD BOTH BEEN IN THE POOL AND AS WE GO OUT AND WAS WALKING AROUND TO GO ON THE DIVING BOARD, I LOOKED UP AND SAW THE SPHERES.  I SAID TO MY BROTHER, WOW, LOOK AT THAT!.  HE LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT I WAS SCREAMING ABOUT AND GOT A FULL VIEW.  THE TWO SPHERES FIRST TRAVELED SLOWLY TOGETHER, THEN PICKED UP SOME SPEED, CHANGING PLACES WITH EACH OTHER.  THEY THEN SLOWED TO A ABRUPT STOP FOR 3-5 SECONDS, ALLOWING US, (BOTH FORMER U.S. AIR FORCE) TO GET A PERFECT, DAYLIGHT SIGHTING.  NO QUESTION THAT THESE WERE NOT AIRCRAFT.  WE SAW THEM CLEAR AS DAY, TWO PERFECTLY ROUND METALLIC SPHERES, WITH THE LIGHT OF THE SUN SHINING OFF OF THEM.  THEY HOVERED, AS I SAID FOR A FEW SECONDS, AND THEN TOOK OF IN A SOUTHERN DIRECTION AT SPEEDS BEYOND CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617

Went into the backyard about 2am,noticed something moving in my neighbors backyard.at first i thought it was my neighbor looking over the fence but it was too late to be likely so i walked over to the fence.i saw a black sphere about 2 -3 feet  across with the look of a polished aluminumfive ft. from me.when i walked towards it it started to go down behind the fence,like i had supprised it! It moved like it was on a hydraulic lift.slow but a very steady speed not floating at all,but looking like it was very heavey.I could still see the sphere through the slits in the fence,and I held my breath .I always wanted to see a ufo.but this really scared me.not because i thought there were aliens inside,but because I've never seen something that looked so heavy defy gravity.after a minuet(seemed like 10)the sphere started to rise again at a very steady slow speed again, untill it was in plain sight again ,and then untill it was behind the dense brush of a tree that was next to it.I ran inside and locked the doors and didnt sleep till sunrise.the next day i told all my friends and my mom.my mom didn't believe me .but the day after i told her we were watching the news and saw a story we couldn't believe.some people surveying land in orange county filmed exactly the same sphere I saw . there were 5 houses on the screen and the sphere went from house to house in hops going a bout 100 ft in the air upto speeds that were clocked at 300 mph.the film was actually made a week before but it didn't make it to the news until after it had been verified by the airforce aswhat the camera actually saw(no video trickery) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Two green luminous spheres moving straight towards the ground and disappeared behind a building.;1998-11-05 18:12:00;1 second;Two green luminous spheres moving straight towards the ground and disappeared behind a building. While sitting in my truck at Van Nuys airport I saw two green luminous spheres move in a vertical line straight towards the ground and then disappeared from view behind a 4 story building.  I saw this while looking to the NNW.  It was totally dark and clear skies with at least 7 planes visable in the Van Nuys and Burbank airport airspace. I was listening to Van Nuys tower on my scanner and an AM brodcast station and heard no interference or verbal reports of the objects.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
Green light seen in the daylight twice in one month.;2003-09-01 16:00:00;10 seconds;Green light seen in the daylight twice in one month. I was on the 405 headed south around Nordhoff when I saw a green light ascending in the sky.  The strange thing is that I had seen the same thing probably a week or so earlier.  It seemed as though it were not a big deal since no one else seemed to be looking and it was the second time within a month that I had seen it.  I just assumed I'd hear an explanation on the news or something.  I'm going to keep my eyes peeled from now on and keep a video recorder handy. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will attempt to check the schedule of missile launches out of Vandenberg AFB to see whether the report coincides with a launch event.  PD));34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
