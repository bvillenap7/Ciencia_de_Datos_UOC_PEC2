When I first noticed it was only one flashing obect which kept going in small circles and was flashing at a steady frequecy of about 1/2 on and 1/2 sec. off. I would say that it was at first approx. 15,000 ft. and rose to another 20,000ft. when it split into tolights of eaqual brightness.  Both lights then rose anoth1 or 2 thousand feet when they disapared.  I have flown Pipers and Cessnas since I was a youngster so I am pretty sure about the altitude.  This was not a peice(s) of alumium foil since the flashing stayed at a equal rate of time and when it did split into two flashes they were both flashing at the same time but flying away from each other.  When they both reached approx. 22,000 ft. they both stoped flashing at the exact same time.  The lights looked oval in shape.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
