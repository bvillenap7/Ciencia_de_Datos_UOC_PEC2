With lights across the middle that changed color with bright flashes. 6:30pm to 6:45pm a round object was slowly moving and decending towards the SW in Van Nuys, CA.  It was south of the airport.  A great deal of air traffic, but they did not seem to notice.  I was traveling west on Saticoy ST to work to lock up.  Noticed the craft and tryed to follow it.  But it was to far away.  It had strobe lights on the top and bottom.(centered)  Across the middle there were 3 or 4 lights that changed from red to orange in bright flashes.  It also would blink out and then only a white flashing light.  It just seemed to be meandering along.  Very weird.  Wanted to get a better look but did not have the time.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617

The circular star appearing object moved slowly to the east at an extreme altitude and disappeared.;2005-04-01 21:00:00;3 minutes;The circular star appearing object moved slowly to the east at an extreme altitude and disappeared. I went into the back yard of my house about 9pm and looked into the sky focusing on what I thought was a star.  As I watched, the star began to slowly move from a stationary position to the east.  I watched for about 3 minutes. The object moved slowly then disappeared. The sky was clear with no clouds. It was circular and was a white/blue color like that of a star. There were no flashing lights on the object and was at an extreme altitude.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
Strange shiny object seen over Van Nuys, CA 4/16/05;2005-04-16 14:45:00;10 minutes;Strange shiny object seen over Van Nuys, CA 4/16/05 I was on my deck 3 to 4 miles south of the object when I noticed a bright shiny silver or aluminum object going slowly east to west across the sky.  It seemed to stop for a second then continue.   I got my binoculars to get a closer look and noticed the object was spinning like a gyroscope.  One moment flat then one moment circular.  The inside looked like spokes from a wheel (maybe 6).  It was at an altitude of under 2000 feet because as I was viewing the object a Southwest Airlines 737 came thru my viewer as it was descending to Burbank Airport.  The pilot should have seen the object.   I called Southwest and a woman was nice enough to take my number while she asked around about the object.  She called back later and said Air Traffic Control had not seen the object.  BUR was about 3 to 4 miles away from the craft.   As I went around to the front of my home to view the object I was not able to locate it again.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
Bright light, 3 or 4 times the size of a star hovered, moved slowly, and then accelerated to an astounding speed till it disappeared.;2006-11-19 05:35:00;a few seconds;Bright light, 3 or 4 times the size of a star hovered, moved slowly, and then accelerated to an astounding speed till it disappeared. My boyfriend and I were driving back home in Van Nuys, when all of a sudden a little bit after 5:30, we saw a circular, bright light about 3 or 4 times the size of a star facing west. It stood still, almost as if hovering for a second and then slowly started moving farther away from us. In about an instant it accelerated to a speed I have never seen any object move in my life and it disappeared just as quickly.  It was very dark here in California and what we saw was very clear. We live by the airport so we are used to seeing planes and we can differentiate between the two. At first we thought it was a shooting star however, we have never seen a shooting star that big, or one that could move that fast in speed. I have never seen a meteor, so I cannot compare, however I do know that I have never believed in UFO's until this day.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
2 Circular-shaped UFOs seen over the San Fernando Valley during daylight;2007-10-17 15:07:00;20 seconds;2 Circular-shaped UFOs seen over the San Fernando Valley during daylight I live in the San Fernando Valley, a well populated suburb of Los Angeles.  I came outside to smoke a cigarette before leaving to run some errands.  I just happened to look up and I saw the first round or circle shaped object.  It was moving due north when the second one appeared and moved in very close proximity to the first.   It then passed the first one a bit and they both sped off in the northerly direction.   It was broad daylight on a partly sunny day.  There were a few fluffy white clouds nearby.   I tried to run inside to get my camera but by the time I could get back, they were gone.  They seemed to be white in color and the best description I can give is that they looked like moving stars.   This is my second time seeing the same type of craft over the Los Angeles area.  The first time was maybe 7 or 8 years ago and there were 3 of them then, also in broad daylight.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
