I could see it from the left corner of my windshield, and watched it shoot down until I couldn't see past the trees. You know how a red safety flare looks when you shoot it up into the sky?  It was like that, but bigger than a flare, and going downwards, at a fast speed. It disappeared behind the tree line before I could get a pic or anything.  Also it was bright green. However,it was a different color green from the stoplights, and my car wasn't moving, so I know it wasn't a reflection from them??  At first I thought it was a firework, but then it didn't go off like you'd expect it to.  It just plummeted downward, and didn't leave a trail of smoke. It's possible it could have been something entering the atmosphere that simply burned green for one reason or another, as it didn't change direction as it fell.  But I felt I should report it anyways.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
