As I was traveling southbound on Van Nuys Blvd. I saw what apeared to be a helecopter hovering in the sky.  The angle of the craft was about 50 degrees and approx., three major blocks south of my location  at about 1500 to 2500 feet above the ground.  I had to drive with my head out of the window in order to see it clearly.  I pulled over to get a better view, and noticed that it had no blinking lights and was not making a sound when it slowly drifted south.  I was trying to determin if it was a helocopter but the shape of the object fluctuated slightly from an egg or oval shape to a blurred oval or egg shape.  The object was clearly greyish and matted, not shinny or illuminated.  The path of the object was stable and straight and had a steady speed.  I say that it was travelling at 35 to 40 mph based on my ground speed.  Ieventually lost sight of the object as it drifted closer to the hills.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
