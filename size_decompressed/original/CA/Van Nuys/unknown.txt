Fast-moving, silent oblects in formation.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-19 20:45:00;2 minutes;Fast-moving, silent oblects in formation. Several items flying in formation moving very fast in the night sky, disappeared into light cloud cover, east to west direction no sound, not brightly lit, light grey in color.  Diamond pattern on left of 4 objects with an additional line of 3 objects to the right.  Objects stayed in in relative position to each other during sighting.  Objects appeared to be somewhat oval.   I am very familiar with the night sky and various normal items that one would see, this was not normal and to silent and too fast to be of terrestrial origin.
