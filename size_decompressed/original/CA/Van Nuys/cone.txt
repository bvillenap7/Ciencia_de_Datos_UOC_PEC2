Really! I wish I had had my camera. I saw a flaming torch-like light. I, at first, thought it to be an airplane on fire. It streaked accross the sky from west to east. (south east direction) It was traveling very normanl like a plane would until I saw it as close as 90 feet above my head. It looked liked a cone shaped re-entry vehicle similar to early space flight of the 1960s. When I saw it that close I saw its color change from orangeish to cold hard grey steel moving at snail pace. I thought it might be a bomb. It made no noise and no one got out. It must have crashed near the freeway by the Van Nuys postoffice on Sherman Way abd Haskell in Van Nuys, Ca. This is my experience and it is most definetely not a joke. I told a few people about it and they thought I was nuts. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  Date is approximate.
