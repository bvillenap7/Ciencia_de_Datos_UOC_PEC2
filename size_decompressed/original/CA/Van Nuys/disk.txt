The craft was ember in color, going about 15 to 20 miles hr. There were no light, combustable jets, propeller assisting in its travel. It flew right over the State of California Employment Development Department. It made no noise and was flying in a straight path. There were no windows, or doors. The ship was solid. Their were other pedistrians that saw it and then when the craft disappeared in the sky every body left. I can be contacted through email (((deleted))@gte.net).;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617

I saw a flat slivery object with no wings climb the southwesten sky going notrheast. I was outside of circuit city on Victory BLVD. In Van Nuys CA. At 11:35 A.M. When my eye caught site of a silvery object in the sky climbing at a (APPROX) 45 degree angel in the southwestern sky going toward the northeasten sky. I watched for about 5 mins as it climbed into the sky. Then I went back into the store to record the information in a personal notebook. It was flat very silvery and had no winfs or tail at all (THIS IS WHAT CAUGHT MY EYE) I regret to say I did not see it do any sudden turns stop in mid air  (though it appeared to slow down extremely, though I admit that could have been A:wishful thinking or B:an optical illusion.) it just climbed in the sky and I recorded the event in my notebook. Only wish to be contacted E-MAIL in order to respect my families privacy. If further info is needed (SUCH AS ADDRESS AND PHONE I WILL CONSIDER IT AFTER BEING CONTACTED BY E-MAIL);34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
4 Disk Shaped Objects sighted flying in formation over Van Nuys, Ca.;2003-01-26 14:40:00;8 sec.;4 Disk Shaped Objects sighted flying in formation over Van Nuys, Ca. I was on my way home from stopping at the ATM in Van Nuys. I stopped to get some Chinese food. I got my order, walked to my car and I got a feeling to look up because of the very clear blue sky that day. I looked up into the blue and stared for about 3 sec. and there they were, 4 ufo's flying in formation/parallel, white and disk shaped. There were two in front and two in back . The two in back were a distance from each other. They came to a stop for a second or two and quickly returned to the formation. They were high in the blue sky. Higher than the chemtrail planes. They were not F-16's, Drones or any conventional aircraft I've ever seen. There was no sound or sonic booms. They were cruising from North to South at a slow pace. I grabbed my 8mm video camera to get a shot and lost the sight of them in the blue. I had a good visual for about 8 seconds and the feeling I got was that they had authority to obsurve.

Fast moving lights seen over Van Nuys California;2011-03-07 19:45:00;3-4 seconds;Fast moving lights seen over Van Nuys California Looking North over the city of Van Nuys California. I saw 3-4 four lights, non blinking, red and yellow, can't remember the numbers exactly but I think more red than yellow, it was only for a period of 3-5 seconds, so really not sure of the exact quantity of lights. The size is hard to say as I have no idea how far or close it was, but it moved very fast. The shape I did not see, only lights, and they were shaped in the proverbial oval/circular shape. Here is my recollection,  I was looking out of our sliding glass door, as I do every night while having dinner. I watched these lights come into view and they banked in such a way, my initial first second or two  thought was, something might be blowing in the wind, as we had winds tonight, but then I realized the lights weren't blinking and they went up and out of my view at a severe angle and in my mind I instantly knew this was not a plane or helicopter. I jumped up and went to the sliding door, 8-10 feet away, all the while looking in the same sky area. I opened the sliding door and nothing was there and everything was quiet, ruling out a helicopter or even a plane. It all happened so fast, I have to say, for a few minutes afterward, I wondered what I had seen. But on reflection, all of my moves were instinctual and that I saw something out of the ordinary. It has clicked in me- that this wasn't what I've been looking out of this window for years at, the various planes, helicopters, even asteroids/meteors. This moved very differently, smoothly and then quickly. From my POV, I see the planes that are on approach to land at Burbank airport and I'm use to seeing things move relatively slowly through the sky. If you have ever been to an RC plane park and have seen how fast the planes fly by in the sky, that is similar to what I saw, though, in this case, no sound. If I had anything to add, I would only add that, it was initially moving like how a helicopter would bank on a turn at low altitude, but this bank was still on an upward incline and then the lights rose up at a steep (maybe 45 degree angle) out that initial circular pattern.  I also called the local police and said, just in case anyone has reported seeing something and they said, well you have (hmmmm okay, I guess just me!?);34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
