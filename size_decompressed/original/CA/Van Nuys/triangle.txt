Large (200') black triangle craft with white & blue lights & plumbing like under structure flew at 350 feet . Loud tonal/buzzing;1983-08-22 22:00:00;0:02 (Min.);Large (200') black triangle craft with white & blue lights & plumbing like under structure flew at 350 feet . Loud tonal/buzzing Van Nuys, Calf. Second or third saturday evening about 10 pm in august of 1983. I was home alone, no other neibors came out. First I was indoors and heard a strange plusating, swirling sound, it could be heard for a distance of a mile buzzing like a electronic keyboard/organ with all the keys depressed, not a combustive sound. Flew at a speed about 15 MPH at a height of about 350 feet. Pipes, holes and waffle impressions underneth. Blue and white lights seemed to bounce independently, lighted the driveway I was standing on. Each of the three sides were about 300 foot edges. I was standing right beneth it and I was over taken with a sensation of awe. after it was out of sight and sound I phoned the nearby airforce post at Van Nuys airport, the direction it came from, (moved eastward) an officer put me on hold indefinetly.  2 years later, it was mentioned on a local TV program (EYE ON LA) by witnesses on a nearby moutain, 2 or 3 miles away. 4 years after, I met one other Van Nuys resident who also saw it that same night and over head as well.

extremely fast, silent, large medium gray(matte finish) triangle with shaded areas at each bottom corner flying from NW to SE.;1999-10-19 03:10:00;3-5 secs;extremely fast, silent, large medium gray(matte finish) triangle with shaded areas at each bottom corner flying from NW to SE. while stargazing at casseopia in the NW sky and marveling that the milky way was actually visible in the san fernando valley at roughly 3:10 am i detected movement in my periphereal vision.  believing it to be a meteorite i drew my girlfriend's attention to it.  a gray triangle flew directly towards and above us enabling us to make out three darker shaded areas at each bottom corner.  the craft passed directly overhead and we watched it fade into the darker southeastern sky(it was initially visible due to sodium streetlamp glow).  we heard no noise and the sighting lasted no more than 5 to 6 seconds.  size and altitude were difficult to estimate and the shade of gray seemed to vary based on the color of the sky.  having served in army intelligence and living on or near military bases all of my life i can without a doubt state that i have never seen anything move through the sky at such speed.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
hovering lights flickering in the sky at tree level moving fast from left to right some landed others flew above us;2006-07-16 23:30:00;4 hours;hovering lights flickering in the sky at tree level moving fast from left to right some landed others flew above us flickering lights were seen from the doorway of the house and as we walked along our front yard we saw many strange trianguler formed lights in the sky there was a significant difference between the stars the planes and the helicopters in the sky as we continued to watch these lights they seemed to move from left to right and hover above the sky.we stood watching closely as we noticed one of the figures rapidly moving downwards toward us.We watched in horror as it flew over our heads and we clearly saw it was no plane or any other normal flying craft.it had three bright rotating lights under it and moved faster than a regular flying aircraft as it flew above us it quickly disappeared.it lasted all night and there were many of them in the sky going up and down or left to right few actually lowered close enough to the earth that seemed to actually land.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
