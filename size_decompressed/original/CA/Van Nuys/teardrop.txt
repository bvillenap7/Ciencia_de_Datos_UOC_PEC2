I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A FALLING STAR (A BRIGHT BALL OF LIGHT)JUST ABOVE THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS.THE LIGHT JUST KEPT MOVING IN;1974-11-15 23:30:00;4 minutes;I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A FALLING STAR (A BRIGHT BALL OF LIGHT)JUST ABOVE THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS.THE LIGHT JUST KEPT MOVING IN A HORIZONTAL TRAJECTORY (FROM SOUTH TO NORTH). I RAN INTO THE HOUSE. I WOKE UP MY BROTHER AND GRABBED MY FATHERS HAND HELD TELESCOPE. THE FLYING OBJECT WAS STILL CLEARLY VISIBLE TO US AS WE WENT OUTSIDE I VIEWED THE OBJECT THROUGH THE SCOPE AND OBSERVED THE SHAPE( TEARDROPED).THE OBJECT WAS LEAVING A VAPOR(?) TRAIL BEHIND IT ABOUT ONE MILE LONG, IT'S COLOR BEING SILVER.THE OBJECT MADE NO SOUND TO OUR EARS AND SHOWED NO PULSATING LIGHTS OF ANY KIND. THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT ITSELF WAS BLACK. THE MOST SPECTACULAR THING ABOUT IT WAS THE MASSIVE FRONT WINDOW HAVING A NON PULSATING BRIGHT GOLD LIGHT EMANATING FROM WITHIN!!!THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF A COMMERCIAL AIRLINE PASSENGER JET.THE SPEED WAS APPROXIMATELY 100 MPH.THE ALTITUDE WAS ABOUT A HALF MILE HIGH AND IT'S FLIGHT PATH WAS STRAIGHT (FROM SOUTH TO NORTH) AND IT MAINTAINED THE SAME ALLTITUED I GREW UP IN A FAMILY OF TEN.I WAS TWENTYTHREE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. I KNEW MANY OF THE IDENTIFIABLE AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA AS WE LIVED ABOUT ONE MILE FROM THE VAN NUYS AIRPORT.VAPOR TRAILS FROM NORMAL AIRCRAFT ARE WHITE IN COLOR AND CLOUDY,THE OBJECTS TRAIL WAS BRILLIANT (JUST AS A FALLING STAR TRAIL IS). THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT WAS TEARDROP WITH THE HUGE WINDOW BEING IN THE  FRONT AND THE LIGHT TRAIL COMING OFF THE POINTED PORTION (THE REAR OF THE OBJECT). MY UNCLE WAS EMPLOYED AT BURBANK AIRPORT AND INFORMED US HE HAD SEEN THE SAME OBJECT WE DID (11:30 P.PM.) ON THAT CLEAR NIGHT .THE NEXT MORNING ON THE LOCAL RADIO STATION IT WAS REPORTED THREE WHITTIER POLICEMEN SPOT U.F.O. OVER THE VALLEY!!! LATER IN MY LIFE I WAS A FIREFIGHTER FOR THE PRESCOTT FIRE DEPT.(7.5 YEARS), AND I DID SEE THE TRIAGULAR OBJECT THAT HOVERED OVER PRESCOTT 2 YEARS AGO.;34.1809795028318;-118.435947688617
