PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;5 minutes;The &quotUfo&quot was a bright sphere, star looking object. It had a foggy dome around it with a blue ray of light shining down towar The Ufo was a bright sphere, star looking object. It had a foggy dome around it with a blue ray of light shining down towards the ground. The light lasted about 2-5 minutes. It started out small in the middle of no where then expanded within time. It was beautiful but creepy because of it fading slowly and the bright light disappearing. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
I have pictures of this rectangle shaped thing in the clouds about 450 ft long by 150 ft wide.  ((anonymous report));2018-04-11 20:03:00;1 minutes;I have pictures of this rectangle shaped thing in the clouds about 450 ft long by 150 ft wide I was taking pictures that day and night.  I stopped on the side of the road to get a picture of a tree in silhouette of some lighted clouds behind it.  It was not until the next day that I was able to see what it was that move across the sky.  There are three pictures of something first taken at 20:03:22 a blur can be seen flying into the cloud, the 2nd taken at 20:03:23 the blur is gone now there is a shape in the cloud that resembles a reptile with wings silhouetted.   Then I seen something move and took the 3rd picture at 20:03:27 and something is flying into another cloud.  And that the only thing I seen that night was movement from one cloud to another against the storm gust of 25mphr.  I can vaguely remember talking to someone there and in 8 pictures later I can see car tail lights can be seen in the 8th picture 30 secs from the first.
