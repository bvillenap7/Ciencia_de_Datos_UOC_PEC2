I was captured, encapsulated,  I was one with that light, the objects were light.;1994-08-31 02:30:00;minutes;I was captured, encapsulated,  I was one with that light, the objects were light. I was travelling north on I-5 at approx. 80 mph.  I was alone in the car, I had to urinate and was speeding towards a rest area I knew was thirty three miles ahead.  There were no other vehicles around me when I saw to my right out in the fields paralleling the interstate a very bright light.  I looked into it and it appeared to be a combine working in the field and loading a big truck.  At the moment of this incident I thought it odd this would be going on in the middle of the night and that the light could blind someone.   Then the combine and big dump type truck seemed to be Tonka type toy's.  Then the rest area was at hand and I realized I had to urinate quite badly.  I slowed and followed the rest area road info the parking lot and parked.   As I did so another smaller car followed mine and parked to my left and the driver got out and hurried over to my car as I was opening the door and he said did you see them? I said see what?  He said the bright lights following your car.  I said no, but I did see the combine with the light shinning on the highway   he said not that, the round lights that were all around your car?   I said no , just the combine and I have to use the toilet fast.   I ran to the rest room and when I came back I went to the passenger side of his car and a woman put the window down and there were three children in the back seat.  The woman and the three girls in the back seat were obviously frightened.  The woman asked me again if I had seen the lights and I told her the same as I had told her husband.  No, I only saw the combine light but that it had held me and I did not remember the last thirty three miles.   I told them not to be afraid, if whatever it was wanted to harm us it would have, and all I accomplished was to further frighten the children.   I got back to my car and headed back north on I-5 to a motel in Stockton.  As I was trying to sleep I felt as though I had been one with that light.  I'll never be sure how long I was with the light, I know I lost attention with the road for at least thirty miles at 80mph.   In the years since I see the combine and truck as toy's and feel as though I was encapsulated by the light.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068

Red Lights In the sky.;2014-02-22 19:00:00;5 minutes;Red Lights In the sky Was walking home as I got closer to my apartment building I normally always look up at the building.  As I look up I noticed 4 red lights in a line formation kind of look like circles but bright red like a light buld shine they had like a blinking to th lights.  I thought to myself what is that.   So I hurried into the apartment building I ran up the stairs to the third floor which is the floor I live on and got my mom and told her to hurry and come outside to the fire escape.  I told her to look and tell me if she could see what I was seeing.  I didnt want to look like I was crazy.   At this time the objects were closer together in a circle shape and stared to just move around slowly in diferent directions.   My mom said she was gonna run in and grab her phone cause my phone was dead.   When she came back out most of them just vanished.  I did get to capture 2 of the objects one photo is kind of fuzzy.  These objects were observe facing west.  I will try to email or send regular mail the picture I have.  If I cant send them I will have them printed out and put away in case u send someone out to get them.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068

On the night of Thursday May 14th 2020 at approximately 9:45PM I observed a group of circular objects orange in color moving from West to East. They made no sound and were not in any particular pattern. I have seen plenty of satellites and the ISS but these looked different and there were more than twenty four and they stayed in their positions and the event lasted for more than four minutes.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
Round, orange glowing craft in the sky, no sound.;2020-05-29 10:00:00;30 minutes;Round, orange glowing craft in the sky, no sound. It was a round, Orange, glowing object and it changed speeds from going very fast to quite slow and changed direction. It did not make any noise. It flew East. My boyfriend is quite skilled in identifying aircrafts and satellites and he was baffled at what this could have been. We were able to get the last sighting on video. It was either one object that looped back in the same direction three times or three separate objects.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
