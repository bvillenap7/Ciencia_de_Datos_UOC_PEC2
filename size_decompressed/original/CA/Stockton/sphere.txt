Two strange bright objects at dusk in the central valley.;2000-10-01 18:00:00;2-3 Minutes;Two strange bright objects at dusk in the central valley. As my wife was driving southbound and I was looking to the west, I noticed two bright objects in the sky. The sun had just set so I could tell they were not stars, as there was still plenty of light in the sky. They looked orange in color. They did not flash or dim. They were a constant color of orange. I described to my wife what I was looking at. They were both at the same point in the horizon. The one on the right was stationary, as the one to the left slowly approached it. My wife said it was a plane or helicopter. I stared in awe as the two lights combined into one. That is when I told my wife I was looking at a pair of UFO's. She tried to see what I was looking at but had to pay attention to the road. I did not look away the whole time. Then, maybe 5-10 seconds later, the lights split up again and the one on the right returned to its original position. It was then that it disapeared for a few seconds, then reappeared for a few moer and then disapeared completely. All the while the one stationary light never even moved or blinked, or anything. I had no idea this web site was around and I happened to come across it on June 15, 2002, and reported my account. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Date is approximate.

Spherical black UFO over Stockton;2008-09-12 16:40:00;5 minutes;Spherical black UFO over Stockton Well I was outside of work, outside the security gate, when I saw what I thought was a blackish purple mylar spinning balloon. I would say it was perhaps 500-1000 feet off the ground, but its hard to say, because, well I know this sounds weird, but its shape was hard to make out the closer it got. It looked spherical, and was scintillating, and curiously, the air around it seemed to shimmer - it was hard to see its edge, that's the only way I can describe it. It moved silently from my left, and I was thinking to myself that if it stopped it would have be a UFO. And then, as if it heard my thought, it stopped directly in front of me! I just stared at it, and I had the most curious feeling of being watched, hard to describe, just felt as if it realized I was looking - so I waved at it.  It then started to slowly go up into the sky. As it was going up, its color seemed to change to a whitish metallic, almost like sodium. And then, it began to flash. A bright, neon green, then pink, and yellow. It also - sounds weird again - seemed to phase in and out of the air. It would seem to disappear, then I would see one of the flashes, and it would appear again at some distance and disappear. This continued until it was a tiny speck in the sky and then I couldn't see it anymore. Interesting day. If you can help me identify what I saw, or let me know if other people have seen similar craft, I would be very appreciative. Thank you for your time.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
Seven Beautiful luminous orange orange orbs dance away above Stockton California;2015-07-31 23:00:00;2 minutes;Seven Beautiful luminous orange orange orbs dance away above Stockton California I was looking at the moon around 11pm, and immediately noticed about 7 massively bright orange/amber orbs, perfectly aligned in almost a triangle shape.  They were still at first, and then started to dance around each other, and some even merged into one another to form a bigger and brighter ball of light.  They were pretty far away, but massively luminously bright and pulsating.  I yelled for my girlfriend to grab her phone but by the time she grabbed it and opened the video app, we only managed to film the last one that was fading away in the distance.  It was like nothing I've seen before.  So beautiful! No air craft or drone that far could emit such massive light, travel so fast, and move in the different directions, that I witnessed.   They disappeared headed northeast from Stockton, toward Highway 99, maybe more toward Lockford, CA.   So beautiful and majestic and defied laws of physics in my humble non-expert opinion.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
Orange red sphere over Stockton Ca on Thanksgiving dusky;2017-11-23 17:20:00;1 minute;Orange red sphere over Stockton Ca on Thanksgiving dusky On Thanksgiving dusk, I was with my inlaws in the back yard of their house in Stockton Ca.  I was telling them oddly enough about a documentary about aliens - when I stopped mid sentence having noticed the orange orb in the sky that seemed to appear out of nowhere.   I alerted my inlaws and they got up and saw the same thing.   It was glowing brightly and was orange red.  It was maybe 15000 feet, silently moved across the sky for about 1 minute.  My inlaws and myself watched it until it suddenly disappeared.  It seemed to be heading south west.   I fumbled trying to get my phone out and take a picture or video, but I couldnâ€™t get it out in time before the Orb was gone.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
