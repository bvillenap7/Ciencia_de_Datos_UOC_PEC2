explosion in the sky;1998-06-15 03:00:00;2min;explosion in the sky ok i will never forget this but the above info is not quite accurate one was a fireball, one was triangular. he he dig this, & i'm telling the truth. the fireball was moving somewhat slow, at first i thought it was a meteor, but it was moving way too slow. it was moving from n.w. to s.e. more south than east.it was also coming down.when all of a sudden there was a white colored blast and a blue pulse of light ( this is the hard part to describe) shot towards it. it was at a very fast speed. almost like a laser, they met & exploded. this happened about a half mile in front of me. i drive truck, a truck driver behind me saw it too. he asked me over the c.b.did you see that? i told him yes. we discussed what it might have been inconclusively some of the things a dark triangle ilumminated during the white flash,a red blink just before the flash. we kinda thought it might be star wars shooting down a missle but the speed & shapes were just wrong. i hope maybe that someone else reported this because i'm really curious, what was that. i would have reported it sooner, but, no p.c. never had listened to A.B. & didn't even know there was a place to report it w/out being drug tested lol thank you, now i've told ((NUFORC Note:  Date is apprximate.

On 08/02/2008 at approximately 2AM, my passenger and I witnessed a large burning object falling SW near Cal State Univ. - Stockton;2008-08-02 02:00:00;6 seconds;On 08/02/2008 at approximately 2AM, my passenger and I witnessed a large burning object falling SW near Cal State Univ. - Stockton While driving NE on a Hwy 4 connector road on Friday, August 2nd at approximately 2AM, my passenger and I witnessed a large burning object falling SW from the sky and seeming to land near the campus of Cal State University, Stanislaus-Stockton in the city of Stockton, California   Since we were en route to our destination, we did not exit to observe where this object landed, but instead called 911 to file a report the incident while continuing to drive on Hwy 4. At first we thought it was a falling star and then I said falling stars skim the atmosphere! Then we thought possibly a meteor, but did not see any explosion or fire from the landing. As we continued to drive, we did a relative size comparison such as: bigger than my Honda CR-V  car tire, bigger than a merge sign, bigger than the small bushes lining the highway. From the distance that we saw the object, we agreed that it was approximately as big as a small car such as a Metro or similar. The shape was hard to determine due to the trail of fire. The flames were coming up from the head and there was a short flame tail behind it. The color was bright white when we first saw it at approximately 1,000 feet up and then became a greenish color (which my passenger commented was the color of a hot object cooling down). I have been unable to locate any news reports of this incident on the internet, newspapers or local TV news websites.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
