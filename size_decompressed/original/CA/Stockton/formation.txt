Multiple contrails on polar trajectory;1999-09-01 06:30:00;2 hrs;Multiple contrails on polar trajectory Not certain of date memory fades, somewhere between 1999 and 2000 on a crystal clear morning.  I witnessed multiple contrails in the early morning traveling on a polar path from the south at extreme altitude (i.e. well above 35000'). The formation was relatively evenly spaced from western to eastern horizons and eventually disappeared over the northern horizon. Possibly, multiple missile tests? Or, b52 formations? Not sure.  I woke wife and daughter to confirm as it looked like a massive ICBM launch based on the altitude and polar trajectory.  Possibly, from Edwards or Vandenburg?  I witnessed a similar even in the late 70's with only one trail and apparent staging which turned out to be a test launch from Vandenburg. This one has always thrown me though.  There were just too many for a test launch.  Calls to AFB, Airport, Paper etc, turned up nothing and unlike the 1970's incident, I am unable to find any corroboration of the event on the internet.   My family and I can't possibly be the only ones to have seen this! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
