UFO DANCING IN THE SKY;2009-10-13 20:30:00;10 secs;UFO DANCING IN THE SKY I was just getting back from my job and decided to take a shower.  After doing so I went outside to walk my dog with my wife.  I was busy looking at my dog when my wife just said, What is that in the sky.  At first I just gave it a quick look and told her it was just a star. I ignored it and looked at my dog again.  She said no its not a star because its moving.  So I look up at the star again but this time it was moving to the right from my point of view.   Again I ignored it and told her it was a helicopter, but as I was about to look away i saw it move quickly to the left and then it caught my attention.  As it moved around in the sky my wife and I stared at this object just moving so fast from left to right.  I asked my wife if she knew what it was but she didnt reply to me.   What me and my wife saw that night, I dont know but it was not any airplane or helicopter.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
2 Lights In The Night Sky;2010-03-24 22:15:00;5-6 mins;2 Lights In The Night Sky It was around 10:15pm last night on the date of 03/24/10 when the three of us friends were outside talking about going to a lake tomorrow, then one of us noticed that a light was moving across the sky very fast with a trail of light behind it.  At first we just thought of it as an airplane or a shooting star but when we saw another one go in the opposite direction we payed close attention to them and then we saw the two lights appear out of no where and they just were sitting there and not moving but they were glowing and we all just were stuck thinking in our heads of what these lights could be. Then we looked at each other in aw and we were just flabbergasted.  After about 3 minutes the light just flew across the sky again in the same direction but it seemed like as the both melted together and disappeared into the dark night sky.  All three of us after that just started talking about what it could be and everyday we try to figure out what it was.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
Possible UFO sighting in Northern Ca.;2010-11-15 21:30:00;1 hour;Possible UFO sighting in Northern Ca. My friends had reported that they had seen a light in the sky, that was stationary, and then would bounce around, then returning to its stationary position.  This was a week before the sighting that we saw.  He showed me the light, which I insisted is probably a satellite or the International Space Station. They insisted that it moved.  I did not see it move that night, but they continue to say that it moves. It is clearly visible from where we were at.  We had to go away from where we were at to get a clear view, as we are in a city. Here are the coordinates and direction we saw it.

In the south east sky over Stockton, Ca.  I thought I had seen a bright flash of white light about the size of a bright star.  No big deal right.  I rubbed my eyes and continued to look thinking maybe I saw a plane.  After that thought I starred into a fixed spot between 2 stars.  Then every 5 to 10 seconds, I was able to see this same light over and over.  Only differance being that it would appear from the southeast to the northeast over and over.   I thought maybe a sattalite....until the last 30 or 45 seconds of my experiance.  In those last seconds, 2 white lights blinked next to each other a few times stationary.  Then 2 seperate like shooting stars going in seperate directions left the sky.  Wow!!!  That is all I can say!!  I have heard the stories....read alot of stuff.  But this was the first time i ever questioned what did I just see.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068

I was driviing south on a neighborhood street when I noticed a light in the sky ahead of my car.  It was traveling in the same direction and almost on the same track.  My first thought was a shooting star but it was moving too slow.   Then I thought a an airplace or helicopter but it was a yellowish color, kind of fuzzy, and didn't have navigation lights.  My windows were up so I couldn't tell if it made any noise.  It moved with  a bouncy, staggering kind of moviement like it was traveling on an invisible bumpy road or traveling against a heavy wind..    I would estimate its altitude at aout 5000 feet.  I lost sight of it when I drove under some trees and made a left turn to my destination.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068

The light seemed odd because I’m used to seeing flashing lights from airplanes. At this point I told my friend to look at the light to verify I wasn’t loosing my mind. He quickly confirmed we were looking at something different. And out of no where the light shot up even higher swiftly and disappeared. No more than 30 seconds later here comes 2 more bright lights from the same direction and literally did the same thing. I thought it was done but no, 2 more came and shot up into the dark sky.

I noticed a trail of lights in the sky to the east of Stockton California. The lights started at a point in the sky and appeared to be traveling south east to a second point in the sky. As a light would reach the second point in the sky it would disappear and another light would appear at the original point in the sky and follow the same trail.  There were 12 white lights when I noticed and they were all flickering. The lights travelled in a straight line. This continued for approximately 2 minutes. While trying to get pictures and video, the lights stopped appearing from the original point in the sky and all travelled to the second point and disappeared.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
