Black huge triangle craft with chevron shape of lights on her belly with a larger red light in the center of the chevron shape travelin;1988-11-15 18:00:00;7 - 10 min;Black huge triangle craft with chevron shape of lights on her belly with a larger red light in the center of the chevron shape travelin At the time of the sighting , I was a 34 year old father of a 3 year old daughter. Married for 8+ years with a stable happy life. Ironically, we had just moved back to the Stockton address (my home growing up)nearly three years previous in December 1984 from Roswell, N.M.. We moved to Roswell by chance. Placed an application at the local sign company while I helped a couple good friends move to Roswell. Not Once did any of my super good partners who were born and raised in Roswell mention/utter a word about the Roswell Incident 40 years earlier. Anyway--- at that time and probably ever sense I was in my late teens I've always had the attitude that anything is possible. I can only say for sure that the date an year can only be 1987 or 1988 in early to mid November. Why I remember that it was in November, we were having an Indian Summer that year. I was watering the edges of my front lawn by hand when for no reason I looked up into the sky above me and all I could see is a black. No stars, no blue-black color that one see's normally as the color of night sky unless you live away from city lights etc.The whole entire sky was filled with this huge black opaque object as far as I could see in all directions. Then through the branches of the tree that I was standing under,set of lights appeared in a chevron shape with a larger reddish orange with a glimpse of yellow lite was in the center of this chevron shape of different colored lights. It was so huge and looked as though it was traveling no more than 30-40 miles per hour. I remember thinking to myself as to what's keeeping this ship from just falling out of the sky. Going way to slow to not fall out of the sky. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I could see the real actual night sky with all the stars in the drk-blue black setting. As it continued passing over, I could see the enormity of this thing as it traveled in a north west direction towards the city of Antioch, Fairfield, Vacaville, Santa Rosa and eventually to the Pacific coast. As it was leaving my area, I was estimating the altitude with the telephone poles in the area. This Mothership or whatever took up at least a 3-4 block sq. area and maybe more at an altitude no more than 300 - 400 ft in the air  and was so quiet (not a peep)it was noisy. I don't know what made me look up. My address at that time was very close to where the Calaveras river dumps into the deep water channel.

The object had 5 or 6  white or blue lights on the back of each wing. The light stayed on during the duration on the sighting.  The object was flying lower than a commercial aircraft but higher than a small plane.  At ground level the object was about 1 inch long with my hand extended. The object was traveling from the south to the north, about the same speed as a commercial aircraft.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068

Triangular formation of white blurry lights over venetian park Stockton Ca;2015-08-13 22:00:00;10 seconds;Triangular formation of white blurry lights over venetian park Stockton Ca I was at Venetian park in Stockton Ca last night with some friends and as we were conversating one friend all of a sudden shouted ((deleted--what)) is that!  I scanned around to see what he was talking about and when i looked up i saw a triangular formation of 3 blurry white lights.  I could not tell if it was a solid triangular craft or 3 seperate orbs butthey looked like they were eminating heat difracting the light around it. sadly it went out of view behind some trees before I could pull out my phone and attempt to record anything on my shitty camera.  As I chased after it to get a better view it was just gone but it was at low altitude and only looked like it was going roughly 60 mph southbound.   Afte ra few minutes of looking around for more objects another friend of mine pointed a similar formation out but higher and going north possibly the same craft/orbs which just appeared flew for a short distance and suddenly was gone. My initial thought was mabey it was a triangu! lar craft with a partial cloaking device as it did appear to come from nowhere it might have been in the process of cloaking and as I chased it was completely invisible or it sped up I really don't know. I thought I would be more prepared for such a sighting but it actually shook me up a little though I thought I had seen a few,once before for sure but that was a while ago.  There did seem to be an influx of helicopter traffic after the sighting over the amount of airplanes flying by which where very distinguishable it was a clear night.  The object/s where completely silent.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
Yellowish orange triangle flying very low and completely silent;2018-03-30 20:45:00;3 minutes;Yellowish orange triangle flying very low and completely silent Looked out my window and saw a triangular shaped object flying silently thru the sky from the west moving south east.  Moving very fast and did not make a sound.  Kinda looked like flames coming out of the top.  After about 3 minutes it flashed and than flashed a few more times and than it was gone.;37.9757431072212;-121.306174617068
