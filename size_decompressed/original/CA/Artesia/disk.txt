Cerritos/Artesia 1980 silent black disc with firey rim observed at dusk;1980-12-08 19:30:00;unsure;Cerritos/Artesia 1980 silent black disc with firey rim observed at dusk I was riding in the backseat of a friend’s vehicle (2 in front, 3 in the rear) traveling north on Pioneer Blvd, specifically to go to McDonald’s. We turned west onto the small street on the south side of the McDonald’s. I recall, very vividly, the object was  a matte black disc with small orange ‘flames’ around its edge, coming from the west, from say Lakewood or Long Beach (one would expect to see the Lakewood Sheriff station’s helicopter on a similar path) with silence. It was around late dusk and I recall remembering the event later and the fact that we seemed to have returned to my friend’s home minus any McDonald's food, no need to discuss the object, and hearing about John Lennon’s murder that evening , which helped me date the event. I make no abduction claims at all, just the sighting, but feel a distinct loss of time from the moment the object was passing over and being back in the TV den at my friend’s house. The street and parking lot, hence the restaurant, was busy when the sighting occurred.;33.8651;-118.0717
