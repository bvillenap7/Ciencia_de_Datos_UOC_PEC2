very effortlessly fast moving object I've ever seen in the sky;2008-02-05 12:40:00;5-8 seconds;very effortlessly fast moving object I've ever seen in the sky I was at the park with my son when i looked straight up the sky I saw the object travelling south east. It was moving very fast did not make any noise or any type of trail. There were other air traffic in the sky. It was not an aircaraft. I have seen fighter air crafts fly over the skies before this thing flew effortless and very fast it only lasted about 5 to 10 seconds before it dissappear in to the horizon. I later contacted few news agancies and miramar air base as well as march field air base, both air bases were no help.;33.6647;-117.1743

It was a greenish blue circular shape ball of light.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:30:00;10 minutes;It was a greenish blue circular shape ball of light. There was no object just a weird colored light in a dark sky. After a few minutes a fog like substance was dispersing as if a flashlight was shining through the dark. Effing crazy stuff and then checked facebook and a friend had posted a video of it. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.

Invisible looking with fading out lights around rims of circle.;2016-08-10 05:00:00;45 minutes;Invisible looking with fading out lights around rims of circle. I had slept with the drapes pulled back a few feet with window open last night.  When my husband left for work at about 4:45 am, I lay back in bed and looked out window, admiring how pretty the silhouette of mountain looked.  I noticed a light bobbing slowly.  Going to the left.  Then behind my curtains.  I thought that did not seem like a helicopter or plane.  I got up and watched it then start to bob up slowing in a straight line.  It had lights that rotated in a circler motion and disapeared and then would restart cycle.  It fired off laser dotted lights in green.  Flickering.  Not solid lined.  Almost flashing.  Then I looked over to right to see if there were possibly more and there was another identical lights.  It bobbed in same place.  Every once it would light up from behind and it seemed to be invisible, but it matched the sky.  It was huge.  I looked back over to first one I saw again and I noticed it was huge also.  Both bottoms were facing me.  Tilting up but jus! t bobbing slightly.  I watched for about 45 minutes.  They never disapeared.  I decided to try to go back to sleep because I have a toddler and new he'd be up soon.  My mind is still trying to take it in. I told my eight year old this mourning.  I don't think I'll tell my husband.  He would probably not believe it.  My mind still can't believe it, but it was very real.  Really amazing!  I looked out about 9:30 this mourning.  Very clear skies.  Very sunny.  I definitely will be going to look out tonight.;33.6647;-117.1743
Circular object in sky with red and green lights pulsed;2016-09-02 22:00:00;1.14;circular object in sky with red and green lights pulsed I was sitting on the back porch and looked up to the sky and saw a circular object with two red lights side by side and two green lights side by side creating a square inside the circle. It was pulsing and rotated half turn in place to flip red and green lights.  It then flipped back. I ran in the house to get my phone to video and recorded it.  It hovered across the sky above me. Shot forward.  Stopped.  Glided back a bit.  Then went to the right. Then sped off fast. No sound. Then disappeared.;33.6647;-117.1743
