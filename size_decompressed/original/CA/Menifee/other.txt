UFO sighting near Menifee, CA.;2014-12-28 13:00:00;15 minutes;UFO sighting near Menifee, CA. Observed a craft hovering in a wheat field during work.  The craft was not making any noise and was rotation in the whole time.  The craft appeared to be larger than my vehicle, a Toyota fj cruiser.   We started to approach the craft when it appeared to come down, but quickly went up when we got closer.  The craft then went straight up and we lost site of it.   A few photos were taken with cell phone, not great.;33.6647;-117.1743
Once in a life time experience!!;2016-08-30 21:50:00;15 minutes;Once in a life time experience!! On the night of Aug 30, 2016, I went out to may back yard around 9:50pm and spotted a dimmed glowing greenish blue spot in the Western sky few degrees off to the North, sort of look like a piece of cloud glowing approx 35-40 degrees over the horizon.  Then it slowly moved to the South West while rising changing shape. At on point it looked straight in the sky. Then it got smaller as it was rising, when it was straight up in the sky (80 dgrees to the South heading East) it got bigger and I saw multiple flashes (flashing lights) and it looked like a massive cluster more than 15 miltiple flashing spots but unable to make a shape out of it. I raised my both hands up in the air and spread them to about 60-70 degreee angle and thats about the size of what ever I saw at the biggest point. A massive cluster of lights.biggest  Then it got smaller and smaler while dissapered into the eastern skies. I also noticed air traffic below pass by like nothing was happening up above. I was baffled by this and my 11 year old son witnessed the entire sighting with me. It never made a noise what so ever. Then tonight I found out that my neighbour also witnessed this at the same exact time along with 3 others.;33.6647;-117.1743
