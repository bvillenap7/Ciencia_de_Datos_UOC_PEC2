Fireball west of Menifee Ca, split into 3 balls then hovered.   ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected parachute jumpers. PD));2011-01-06 21:35:00;2 Min;Fireball west of Menifee Ca, split into 3 balls then hovered There was a Orange/Red fireball coming down.  It was larger than any shooting star I had ever seen, and seemed to move slower with a large wide trail.  After 10 or fifteen seconds two fire balls split off, one went to the left of the main ball and the other went  to the right.  After a few seconds the trails went away and the three lights just hovered.  I turned on the video camera on my cell phone, however the record button didnâ€™t work at first, so I lost an additional 10 seconds before I realized this.  I was in the parking lot of a pharmacy and it was well lit, so I walked towards the lights to a fence to an open field, hoping to get a better shot.  Once I got there I noticed the three lights changed colors a couple of times.  1:22 into my video the lights just disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected parachute jumpers. PD));33.6647;-117.1743

Two friends came over for New Year's, but instead of 'Hi,' one friend came in shouting 'I think there's a UFO!' My other friend stayed.;2015-12-31 20:40:00;5-10 minutes;Two friends came over for New Year's, but instead of 'Hi,' one friend came in shouting 'I think there's a UFO!'  My other friend stayed outside to watch.   They had seen three fireballs, in a triangle formation (an upright triangle.)  By the time I came out, one of the orbs had disappeared, leaving just two.   These are the objects that I witnessed.  They appeared to be balls of light, with an orange core flaring out to red.  They moved very slowly, completely silently they traveled in a south east direction, over the Menifee/Murrieta area, and then they slowly disappeared.  They didn't simply pass beyond our line of sight, they seemed to almost burn out.  Not sure what it was, but it would be nice to know.;33.6647;-117.1743
