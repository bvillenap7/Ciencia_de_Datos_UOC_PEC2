An interesting round object seen in Menifee, CA, 11/13/2014, approximately 8:30 pm. Yellowish with a darker brown bottom color, a darker center.  Hovered quietly above park trees, I walked around corner from my house and it made a quick dart away from me, headed west, then another quick dart south and suddenly went up higher and headed west, where it just disappeared. The object made no noise and I would have regarded it as a toy drone, but the speed, the quick ascent and the brisk disappearance could not be done by a drone. Fast planes pass by my neighborhood and I can track them for miles.  Hot air balloons are seeing frequently and these do not have speed capabilities.  Holiday balloons can be tracked and often easy to track their landing once the little fire dissipates.  This object did not move like anything I have ever seen.;33.6647;-117.1743

At a normal eye it appeared to be a airplane but after 30 minutes it was just hovering I took out my binoculars and zoomed in best I could. The object was a triangular shape of high  lighted appearance . I took over 2 hours to move from my southern gate to the middle of my yard approx 20 feet.  This would cancel out the space station based on visible time line. Iâ€™ve check out as much as I could on the web and no reference. I had a friend over and my wife that could not understand what we were seeing Kinda of feel like Richard Dreyfus with mashed potatoes;33.6647;-117.1743
