We saw two bright orange lights in the sky if you were looking North East of the 215 and newport road in Menifee Ca.  One looked higher in altitude. Both were montionless.  After 2-3 minutes of observation, the higher altitude craft just fanishes,  30 seconds later the 2nd one disappeared as well.;33.6647;-117.1743
