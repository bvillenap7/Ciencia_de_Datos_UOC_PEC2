bright ufo light in Menifee CA, August 13th & 14th 2006;2006-08-13 23:00:00;1 to 2 minutes;bright ufo light in Menifee CA, August 13th & 14th 2006 We were sitting in our spa in the back yard on Sunday 8/13/06.  It must have been between 11:00 p.m. to 11:30 p.m..   All of the sudden a white light but smokey and translucent appeared from no where and travled at a high rate of speed from west to east.  Imagine someone holding up a black cloth and then an object appearing through a hole made on the left side of the cloth and then disaperring back into the cloth on the right.  It was not a plane or a helicopter.   Then on Monday the next night on 8/14/06, again we were in the spa.  It was the same time because we got out at 11:30 p.m. to watch Jay Leno.   Again, the same light from the same direction from the west to the east.  This time the hair stood up on our arms.  And we both kind of freaked out.   So we both starred at the sky thinking it would happen again and god it did, except this time it travled from east to west.   Both days, all three times, it appeared in the exact location and travled in a straight line.  It was not a shooting star becuase we see those all the time.   This was completely different and very bright white light.  Almost like a bubble and a smokey translucnet thing.  It wasn't perfect round.  It all happened so fast.  It was very weird.;33.6647;-117.1743
