As I watched it hover, I walked past a tree and the trunk of the tree was in exact alignment with the UFO so once I walked past the trunk the UFO was gone-or perhaps simply remained but was undetected by the human eye.  It's the 3rd or 4th time in probably 10 years I have seen a UFO in this area.;33.6647;-117.1743
