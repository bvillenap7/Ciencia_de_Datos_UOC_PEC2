Green circular of lights spinning and zipped across the sky in Visalia California within seconds.;2008-06-10 21:05:00;1 minute;Green circular of lights spinning and zipped across the sky in Visalia California within seconds. My cousin and I were outside riding the quad and this oval structure with green lights spinning went really fast across the sky.  It kind of stopped and turned real slow, like it was looking at us then zipped across the sky and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports.  Possible meteor?
