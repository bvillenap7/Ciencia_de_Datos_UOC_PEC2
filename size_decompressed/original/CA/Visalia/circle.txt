White balls of light swirling in a pattern overhead;2020-11-07 23:00:00;30 minutes;White balls of light swirling in a pattern overhead They were white circular objects. There were about 10, hard to count with clouds in the background. They were swirling around in the sky in a pattern. They moved slowly from south to north keeping in a pattern each time they came around.  Before I came back in they switched  from singles to doubles. Then went back to singles.  There was no sound emitted. It was too dark to get a video on my phone.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868
