I was standing by my car when I saw the light about 2 miles away. Then within a matter of seconds it was over my head moving towards the east. It was a bright amber sphere and was moving extremely fast without sound or without leaving a contrail. I tried to drive to keep it in my sight. By the time I had driven three blocks the object had moved about 15 miles eastward. I decided that it would be pointless to pursue any further since it had traveled so fast. After that I headed towards the northwest side of town where my friend lived. Just before arriving at his home, I saw the same object fly over me again at an incredible speed, this time toward the west. I called my friend since the object would soon fly over his home. My friend didn’t believe me thinking I was making a joke. There were three of us at my friend’s house, when about 21:30 I decided to make a food run. As I was driving I saw the same object again, but this time there were two objects one just above the other. I stopped my car to make sure that it wasn’t a perception problem. I called my friend and immediately drove toward his home again. The three of us saw the objects slowly move, stop, hover, and move again. The movements of the objects were very erratic and they moved independently from one another. One friend, that was watching these objects with me, was in the navy and worked as an aircraft identifier on a carrier ship. He said that there was nothing to his knowledge that would exhibit that kind of movement and fly that close together. We watched these objects as they slowly moved across the sky. After about five minutes, they started blinking and then just vanished.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868
