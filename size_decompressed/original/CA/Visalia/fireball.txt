((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what a fireball is that lasts for 90 minutes.  Our first guess would be that the witness was looking at a twinkling star, but that is only a guess.

Strange, slowly moving fireball like object in the sky.;2014-05-07 20:30:00;3 minutes;Strange, slowly moving fireball like object in the sky. I was on the phone in my driveway at approximately 8:30 p.m. in the evening, in Visalia, California, when I noticed a reddish, flare like colored object slowly rising up into the sky in the North West.  At first I thought it might be some kind of flare, but after observing it for approximately one minute, I ruled that out as there was no light trail of any kind and it actually appeared to be traveling.   I then thought it might be some type of remote control plane, until it began traveling South East, over my neighborhood.  It was moving very slowly, and much, much lower than an airplane. It was completely silent.  It was flickering an orange-red color, like a flame, but not in any flashing pattern.   As it went above me, it reminded me somewhat of a jellyfish, like a ball with a light inside.  It was about 4 times larger than the brightest star in the sky.  It rose a bit higher and then flickered out and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be serious-minded.

My wife and I observed an orange colored illuminated object moving from southwest to the east in the night sky.;2018-03-25 21:20:00;5 minutes;My wife and I observed an orange colored illuminated object moving from southwest to the east in the night sky.  My wife and I observed an orange colored illuminated object moving from southwest to the east in the night sky.  The object did not produce any audible sound, like rotors, engines, drone hum, or jet roar.  The object moved relatively slowly, not unlike a high flying aircraft. However, no red or green blinking lines or tail lights could be observed.  Most oddly, the object would flare brightly and then seem to snuff out, like a dying ember, only to flair bright orange again.   There was no pattern or rhythm to the flaring or diminishing of the light and no color change was observed.  It remained a steady orange color.  My wife described it as on fire and I would not disagree. I have studied astronomy all my life in Scouts, college courses, and as an astronomy enthusiast volunteering in our National Park.  I have spent a great deal of time in the wilderness backpacking and such, watching the night sky from remote places.  I have seen Iridium flares and regularly watch the ISS and other objects in the night sky, thanks to smartphone apps.  I have seen drones, shooting stars (including big ones) and watched meteor showers.  I have watched rocket launches from Vandenburg AFB in the night sky.  This was something new to me and something outside of anything easily explanable based on my experience. The object was observed from my side patio where we were eating dinner, then we moved to the backyard to watch it further until it faded somewhere over the Sierra Nevada mountains.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868
Fireball in the sky;2019-11-21 20:05:00;1 minute;I was driving home(southbound) on Demaree St., when I looked up and I saw a strange orange-yellow, flame-like object to the south south East. When I stopped at a red light I could see that it was swaying back and forth over the trees below. It looked like a flame or fireball in the sky. I picked up my phone and started to record but could not get a good recording. I hurried to my house which was about a block away so that I could park my car and get a better shot. When I parked and got out of the car to look for it, it was gone. I did a short a vague video of the object.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868
