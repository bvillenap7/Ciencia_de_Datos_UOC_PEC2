Orange orb witnessed in the Central Valley night sky! ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  PD));2011-04-14 21:25:00;7 minutes;Orange orb witnessed in the Central Valley night sky! Two of my friends and I were playing basketball outside at a local church.  We looked up at the south south west night sky and noticed an orange orb.  It was 3 times bigger than commercial airliners that you would see flying at its highest point in the sky.  We watched it as it was staying in the same spot and then it started emitting a very small trail and a haze of orange as it started moving slowly east. It then instantly disappeared.   A couple seconds later it reappeared instantly in the spot it disappeared.  Another couple seconds went by and it disappeared again instantly.  We never heard it making a sound during the whole 7 minute sighting.  We watched for another 30 minutes to see if it would reappear again but it never did. We live in between China Lake military base and Lemoore Navel Air Station and see jets fly back and forth between bases all the time.  There is also a small airport near by and see planes landing. Commercial airliners fly over head as well between Fresno, CA and Los Angeles, CA area frequently. We don’t know what it was.  It was a clear night with no clouds in the sky and a bright moon. Whatever we saw that night was not a plane.  It had no characteristics of the other planes in the sky like flashing lights or turning on white head lights on a descent to land.  Hopefully we could get some answers of what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 21:24 hrs. (Pacific).  PD));36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868
4 lights moving in a precise pattern as though on the perimeter of a sphere.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising light.  PD));2011-11-24 21:50:00;15-20 minutes;4 lights moving in a precise pattern as though on the perimeter of a sphere, following us for 15 mi.to our home This happened last night (Thanksgiving) between 9:45 and 10:00 pm.  We were traveling in our car south on Highway 99 from Fresno toward Visalia.  There was a cloud cover and I looked out my right side window ( West) and noticed some dancing white lights.  At first I thought it was a spot light being shown up into the sky, perhaps to attract people to a Black Friday shopping location.  However, there weren't any stores near where this was occurring.  I kept watching them while my husband was driving. The lights were moving in a very distinct and exact pattern.  There were four of them.  They were in a circle and they would rotate perfectly to the left about 90 degrees and then they all converged and meet as one in the middle of this circle.  Then they would move back out to the perimeter of the circle, rotate to the left,  then once again converge to the middle and start over again. I say circle because although I could not see anything but the lights, the pattern they moved in was a circle.  Each of the 4 lights was the same size and they were softened by the cloud cover between the  actual light and us. This changing of the pattern was constant and occurred several times each minute. It was as though they were on the outer edges of a round object, would rotate 1/4 way around the object, all come back to the middle of the object, then return to the outer edges.  I remarked to my husband that it looked like the lights were doing a square dance. The precision that they moved in was completely consistent every time. Then, as we traveled down the highway the lights stayed right with us along the highway, traveling just west of us but staying with us,  I mentioned this to my husband, and he saw them as well. We had traveled at least ten miles since I first noticed them, but they stayed right with us. This really had our attention.  We took the off ramp to exit the highway and stopped at the top of the ramp as there was no traffic behind us. We watched the lights travel and stop right in front of us, (up in the sky of course) and hover there and the lights never wavered from their moving pattern, It kind of freaked me out that they stopped and hovered there as we stopped at the top of the ramp. We turned left and traveled three or four miles north to the road where we live, which is a state highway. The lights stayed above us and to the right of us, but definitely with us.  We got to our road, and I was really feeling some anxiety. We turned left and traveled about 3/4 of a mile to our ranch and I couldn't see them behind us.  I was relieved! We had to hang a u turn to get into our driveway, and there were those 4 lights, hovering just off our driveway, right next to our house.  We rolled down the windows to try to hear anything, but there was complete silence.  I thought several crazy thoughts because it was very weird.  I felt like whatever it was knew I had noticed it and decided to follow us.  I was freaked out and got into the house as quickly as possible.  My husband had to go check on the livestock and said it was still out there when he came in. I called the sheriff's office this morning and no reports of any lights came in from anyone, but they gave me the information to contact you, so this is what we saw. My husband is a rancher and farmer, has been in business over 50 years I am a retired business owner, serve on several boards and am very active in the community. ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising light.

Sky suddenly dimmed during a lunchtime walk.;2016-08-26 13:00:00;2-3 seconds;Sky suddenly dimmed during a lunchtime walk. Yesterday, on August 26th, I was walking from a local community college to a nearby Taco Bell with five of my friends.  The Taco Bell sits behind a bus stop and is on a busy street in our town, Visalia, CA.  The traffic was stopped.  The skies were clear – no clouds.   It was a little before 1:00 pm.  We were walking and talking when the sky suddenly dimmed and then became light again.  It was about a 2-3 second event.   One of my friends stopped, and said, “Whoa – did anybody else see that?”  We all saw the light dim and quickly returned to normal.   Some thought it was a large truck going by but the traffic was stopped and no large trucks anywhere.  There was nothing in the sky – clouds – airplanes-birds that we could see.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868
