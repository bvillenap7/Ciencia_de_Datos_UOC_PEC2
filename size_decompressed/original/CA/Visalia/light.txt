PD)) we were in the back yard and watched as the object moved and left a glowing blue contrail or cloud which stayed in the same position at 21:20 on friday the 7th of july in visalia, ca. I and several freinds spotted what we thought was a spot light coming in our direction. there were no clouds in the sky and it was very clear. the object was southeast moving at a slow rate of speed to the north. we observed the object for approximately 5 minutes when it appeared to be moving away at a high rate of speed. within 30 seconds it was out of sight , but left a blue contrail behind in its wake. the blue cloud or contrail stayed in the air and didnt move for another 15 to 20 minutes before it dissapated. there was no sound and the object appeared to be approximately 3 to 4 miles from our position. the blue cloud or contrail had an earie glow. i have never seen any kind of craft like this and all my friends are as baffled as i am.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868
Two bright yellow/orange lightd moving slowly from south, south east to north, north west.;2006-12-13 20:20:00;5 min;Two bright yellow/orange lightd moving slowly from south, south east to north, north west. No sound. Moved evenly appprox. 20 degrees and then stopped in sky. Very bright. Then stopped and stayed within sight due south in sky for about 4 minutes before Going out one at a time. I had time to call my wife from my house to come and witness this event. I had time to go into my house for my digital camers and snap 4 photos. One photo reveled what I think are two triangular shapes with the bright light in the center and 3 each fainter lights in the photo defining the shape. On the photo there is also appears a third fainter light between which was not visible to naked eye. Duration was approx 5 min. and they went out. No sound. Night sky was dark with very high scattered clouds.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868

It stayed in the same spot just moving back and forth for about 30-45 minutes, then just disapeared.  Kind of hovering back and forth.  We kept looking at it and took some pictures, but the movie pictures just looks like a white speck moving back and forth.  The movies look nothing like just looking at it with the naked eye.  We thought it was a bright star, but it had green around it and it hovered back and forth.  We also thought at first it was a helicopter, but it never moved.  We never took our eyes off of the object, then it just disapeared.  No movement at all.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868
3 small white lights in the shape of a triangle, one object only;2010-06-09 04:50:00;2 minutes;3 small white lights in the shape of a triangle, one object only I woke up at 4am that morning to get ready for work.  I am currently a student in the medical field and I had to be at the hospital by 5:30 am that morning.  It was still sort of dark out, enough that I had to turn my headlights on.  There was no wind. The sky was clear, no clouds were in site.  I got in my car around 4:50am, started it and waited for it to warm up. I live in a normal neighborhood in the south east part of the city.  As I was backing out of my driveway I happened to look up in the sky out of the driver’s side window, which would have been towards the west.  I saw a fairly small whitish light about 45-55 degrees above the horizon in the sky.  It almost looked like a star.  When I first saw it I did a double take, when I fixed my eyes on the object it looked like it was moving around very fast and then it stopped and hovered for a few seconds.   After that I started driving west down my street still looking at it through the front windshield of the car.! It was moving very slowly.  There were no flashing lights, or blinking lights like those on an airplane or any other man-made aerial craft.  As soon as I got to the end of the street at the stop sign I stopped and got out of my car and was watching the light slowly travel north north east at a fairly slow rate, slower than any airplane could fly without crashing.  When I got out of my car and looked up at the object it was pretty far away, but it almost looked like there were 3 lights in the shape of a triangle.  They appeared to be kind of close together, like it was a single object, not 3 flying objects in close proximity.   For a few seconds I was pondering driving back to my house to grab my video camera, but I didn’t want to lose sight of it as it was traveling away from me.  (Later that evening I checked to see if my video camera was even charged and it wasn’t.  I am always going to make sure it is from now on at all times.)  I was parked in front of a neighbor’s house long e! nough for someone to turn on their front porch light.  I don’t ! know if they saw me and was wondering what I was doing.  I didn't want them to call the cops thinking I was a prowler or anything so I got back in my car and watched the object moving away from me slightly increasing in speed. I backed the car up back towards my house so I could try to see it as there were trees blocking my field of view and I gradually lost it in the sky due to the sun starting to rise over the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range.   Like I said I know what I saw, and I saw something that wasn’t man made. It looked like it had 3 small lights in the shape of a triangle and they were white. I am not a liar.  I consider myself very credible.  I teach at a local high school, and I am also a student in the medical field.  I have also seen several other unknown objects in the sky over my lifetime.  Hopefully someone else saw the same thing I did, but it’s highly unlikely that anyone will report it.  Thanks. I hope this has been helpful and I hope someone will believe me.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868

For months, if you look toward the East sky line, toward the Sequoia Mountains, you can see a very bright light.  It is always at about the noon to 1 o'clock position.

Bright light (missile?) from the north west, descending to the south east.  ((NUFORC Note:  Intl. Space Station.  PD));2017-08-14 20:42:00;2 minutes;Bright light (missile?) from the north west, descending to the south east. Solid white light very far away to the west.  It was moving much too fast to be a plane, but too slow to be a meteor.  It appeared to rise up from the horizon from the northwest, then gained altitude while heading south.   It traveled for about 2 minutes and lost altitude, and the light went out as it was descending to the south, slightly southeast.
