Mass witnesses.;2014-09-12 06:00:00;15 seconds;Mass Witnessess. It was 6am, Friday morning.  I was walking to school for our Senior Sunrise, (event where the entire Senior class takes a photo during sunrise), but it was still very dark.  There was about 40 or more kids that made it early.  I hear a student say, what's that?  I turned around and at first I thought it was just a helicopter searching for someone.  Then, the bright light started spinning and growing in size.  At that point it was like a flare.  My other friend told me that if it was a flare it would've been brighter.  A bright haze surrounded the object and then it disappeared.   Hope to hear this on Coast to Coast.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868
