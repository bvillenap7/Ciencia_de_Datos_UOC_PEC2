Me and my two friends were out on a country road, they were sitting on the back hatch of the car facing west and i was standing facing east. I took a few side steps to the left, and as soon as the back of the car was out of my view, that's when i saw a cigar shaped object zoomed downwards in the distance probably no more than 5 miles away from where i was. This cigar shaped object flew down to much at an angle, and going way too fast to be a plane. It had two streaks of lights more towards the front. We stayed at our location for another 20 min or so and i did not see this object return into the sky, i truly believe that i did see a UFO or ET spacecraft of some kind.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868
