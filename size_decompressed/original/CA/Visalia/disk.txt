Three flying disks, spotted close up during daylight hours.;1972-05-15 16:00:00;1 minute;Three flying disks, spotted close up during daylight hours. I was sixteen years old at the time.  We lived on a farm on Shirk Road, west of the city of Visalia.  I was walking south along the edge of a vineyard when something caught my eye in my peripheral vision.  I turned and saw three disks flying in formation about fifty yards east of my position and only about 20 feet above the tops of the valley oak trees growing on the canal bank on the north edge of the vineyard.  Two of them were close together with the third following behind them. They were shaped like truncated cones.  They had the appearance of brushed stainless steel--a dull gray color.  They were flying silently at about 30 mph.  As I watched them, I had the distinct impression that they were also observing me.  I can't really explain that sensation. As I stood watching them, they floated over the vineyard, and then suddenly, they was a red streak in the sky, arching upwards and they were gone.  I was studying for the FAA private pilot's exam at the time.  My father was an anti-aircraft gunner in WWII.  When I was small, his idea of a fun time on Sundays was to go to the airport and watch planes take off and land.  I can honestly say that I could identify practically every aircraft I spotted in the air at the time.  These were not airplanes, helicopters, balloons or blimps.  They were silent disks capable of silent flight and incredible acceleration.   The sun was still high in the sky, and they were plainly visible.

There was one main one that was a disk shape that had bright individual lights that would sporadically turn on  and sometimes rotate and for various amounts of time.  After some time yellowish/orange lights shot in and out of the main craft and would fly/move around in unpredictable movements. Some of theses lights shot towards the ground others around the main craft.  As the hours went on the craft moved father away with the lights continuing to shoot in, out, and around it. We believe the lights to be smaller crafts that were able to fly into the main craft.  The first person to sight the main craft says she saw the main craft have 5 or 6 windows.  This was all seen from a second story house and the craft(s) were low in sky and above fields/ bird land.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868

The object suddenly stopped and made a sharp right angle turn to the right and stopped again and made another right angle turn in which appeared to have dropped in altitude and stopped again.  The object then made another right angle turn to the left and stopped.  At this point the object got much brighter and took off at an impossible rate of speed until it disappeared.
