formation fly lights over California;2009-06-04 21:50:00;1 1/2 minutes;formation fly lights over California On June fourth 2009 at 9:50 PM I looked up at the moon.  It was mostly cloudy and I saw about 18 small white lights appear.  I thought they were balloons or papers flying high in the sky and being illuminated by the city lights.  As I observed I noticed the lights moving in and out of the clouds. I came the conclusion that they were much higher up about 13,000 feet.  They were not aircraft with blinking lights, these were brilliant white lights that lit up at the same place in the sky as they were traveling east and then they disappeared into the clouds again.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868
Multiple craft forming patterns and flying in unison.;2014-12-21 16:00:00;5-10 minutes;Multiple craft forming patterns and flying in unison The lights were bright red/orange and were fairly low because there is heavy cloud cover in the sky tonight and the lights appeared to be in front of them.   They were positioned in a zig zag pattern at first but were constantly but slowly moving in unison and changed the pattern to a line with a diamond shape at one end, before just disappearing out of site one by one after having been watching them for around 5-10 minutes.

We thought they were stars and as we kept looking they slowly disappeared.  It wasnt a gradual disappearance as if they were flying away like an airplane.  Almost like a light dimming out.  No sound and no blinking lights like an airplane and no movement.  Our dog was barking from the backyard.;36.3364301886792;-119.299558018868
