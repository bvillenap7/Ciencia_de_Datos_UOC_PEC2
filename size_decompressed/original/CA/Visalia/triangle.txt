white object passed overhead moving southeast disappeared, within 10 minutes saw oddshaped white object traveling northward trajectory;2010-08-24 10:00:00;10 minutes;white object passed overhead moving southeast disappeared, within 10 minutes saw oddshaped white object traveling northward trajectory 8/24/10 Visalia, CA  <15 min.  About 10:00 am  I saw an oblong or possibly triangular white object overhead while looking westward driving downtown.  It was headed in a southeasterly direction, behind a tall apartment building.  I turned and headed southward on the next street and looked into the sky but didn’t see anything.  It was a blue sky and very clear day.  There were no objects in the sky at all, including planes.  I ran a quick errand after which, about 10 minutes later, I was in my car parked in a large parking lot a couple of miles southwest of downtown Visalia.  While parked, I looked for no particular reason out the driver’s window to my left.  An object in the sky caught my attention.  I looked up and saw what appeared to be a white object, definitely not a plane, headed overhead in a northward direction.  The shape was kind of triangular and I watched as it passed overhead past a freeway and continued on a northward trajectory appearing almost to turn over in a ‘hurtling’ manner.  I don't know what its elevation was.  I watched it until I couldn’t see it anymore.  What came to mind was that earlier object. Also, I hadn’t heard nor seen any planes overhead in the time I had been outside that morning. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
