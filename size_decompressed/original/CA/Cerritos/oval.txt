Hello,                                                                 19 Sep 2014 	Yes I heard the C2C show this week and heard your report of a 3 ft UFO above the Boulevard near Disneyland.  I saw a similar thing 10 miles away just 3 ft above my head and patio cover,  around 2 ~ 3AM. I walked outside to investigate the racket of a very nearby  helicopter.  To my surprise there were THREE objects maneuvering within 20 ft of my patio cover in the dark with no perception of on board lights just a ghostly fluorescence. 	All sorts of maneuvers that I couldnâ€™t hear. 	After 2 minutes I became scared and ran back into my house. 	One object looked like a 3ft white  fluorescent goodyear blimp, but without any markings or lights. It could perform complicated Spins both forwards, or backwards.;33.8665000000001;-118.0668
