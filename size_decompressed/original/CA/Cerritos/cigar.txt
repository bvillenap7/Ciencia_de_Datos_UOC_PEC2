I approached the intersection of 183rd and Studebaker Road and stopped in the secured left hand turn lane. As I was waiting for the light to turn green, I suddenly saw a silver object in the sky.   It was oblong/cigar shaped and perfectly symmetrical.  It seemed metallic because the sun was reflecting off its outer hull. Today was about 80 degrees with clear blue skies. No buildings, telephone poles etc. obstructed my vision.  I focused my eyes to see any evidence of wings or other noticeable features it would have with common aircraft.  It had no bolts or apparent fastenings, just seamless metal. It was about 3,500 feet to 5,000 feet in the sky, the normal range where most aircraft fly. My window was ajar and I could hear no sound (as one would with a normal plane).  It left no air trail in the sky. I tracked it for about 60 seconds from right to left (it seemed to be heading west) and it suddenly disappeared.;33.8665000000001;-118.0668
