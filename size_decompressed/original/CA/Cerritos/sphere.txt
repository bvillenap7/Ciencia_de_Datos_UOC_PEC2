Circular non transparent object seen hovering inside house;2004-05-08 05:00:00;5mins;Circular non transparent object seen hovering inside house Well,it was an early saturday morning and I usually get up early while it is fairly dark outside.My alarm went off and I reach over to turn it off and l layed back down on bed and was facing upwards towards the ceiling(it was still dark in my room)and saw what looked like a circular light fixture that you might see on a ceiling fan,I could even see a rim attached behind it,or on top of it.At first I really didnt think too much of it but then realized that I dont have any ceiling light fixtures in my bedroom and became alarmed and then the object moved to the far side of my room and begain to move in a circular pattern approx 1-2 ft circular pattern I then started to alarm my roommate in the next room the object  seemed to go right through the ceiling and was gone,I only remenant on the ceiling was some marks on the acoustic ceiling like a something with a pointed tip left in a semicurular pattern right where it went through the ceiling.The object size seemed approx 8-9ins in diameter and it never did show any signs of lights or glowing or sound...but did leave and odd smell of sulfer;33.8665000000001;-118.0668
