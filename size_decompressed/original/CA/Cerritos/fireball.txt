Odd Red- Orange orb - then becomes a fireball seen on 405 freeway in Orange county 1/29/2016.;2016-01-29 23:50:00;1 minute;Odd Red- Orange orb - then becomes a fireball seen on 405 freeway in Orange County 1/29/2016. I am reporting what a friend said to me, after driving down the 405 freeway south, just north the 22 split - along the naval base that parallels the freeway. An orange-red ball was about 30 feet above the ground and following traffic (as I understand) but at a different speed. Then the ~36 inch ball at a point in time turned into a FIREBALL, and continued to move out of range of people on the freeway who could see it.  I suspect perhaps at least 20 other drivers may have seen it. I hope someone's dash cam captured it!  Lasted less than 40 seconds, I understand. I remain anonymous.  I hope others also report this incident! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.8665000000001;-118.0668
