sighting of object traveling at high speed with unusual movement and shape.;1999-11-29 22:15:00;3.50 seconds;sighting of object traveling at high speed with unusual movement and shape. A friend of mine and I were discussing how clear the sky was on this night, when he asked me if the little dipper was made up of stars. At that instant he looked up at a easterly angle towards the little dipper, when he did he said wow,what is that ? I had already looked up by that time and noticed a disk shaped object with a dark center and white around the outside. it was not a light but more like white against a dark sky. the object traveled from about three feet of my sight to the left of the little dipper as scale to about a foot to the right of it in a straight line and then dipped downward at about a seventy degree angle for about a second and then turned right at a 90 degree angle and traveled directly away from me for about a second and a half before dissapearing from sight. This area is near L.A. international airport and there is alot of air traffic and after seeing the object we compared times of airplanes covering approximatly the same diastance and by our estimations the object was traveling 50 times faster than a commercial airliner. and covered the complete horizon in about three and a half seconds. I am a 39 year old male and my occupation is a printer. my friend is a 39 year old truck driver. He and I agreed immidiatly afterwards that we had never seen anything even remotly like this and I had never even entertained the thought of seeing a U.F.O. in my neighborhood. We were at liberty park playing a game of night frisbee disc golf when the sighting occured.;33.8665000000001;-118.0668
