Bright glowing blueish green ball (shaped like a fireball) spotted speeding downward from the sky.;2016-02-11 06:40:00;<1 minute;6:40  AM today in Cerritos, CA, bright glowing, blueish green ball (shaped like a fireball) spotted speeding  downward from the sky. This morning, approximately around 6:40 am, I was outside and noticed a reflection on my glass door of a greenish, blue and yellowish glowing ball (like a fireball) moving across the sky.   I turned around to face it and it was moving fast, headed for earth.   I saw it for maybe 35 second (includes the time I first spotted it as a reflection), before homes and trees blocked my view.,  I actually stayed quiet and still, waiting for a loud crash or a jolt, which I did not hear or feel.  Note:  I was not sure about which shape to select, but it was between the fireball and the teardrop.  There was definitely a roundness to it, but had a tail like a fireball falling from the sky at great speed,   This ball was quite brightly glowing, considering the morning sky was fairly lit, and my glass door was  dusty,. ((NUFORC Note:  Video captured by a beach camera at Doheny Park, Dana Pt., CA.  Object appears to us to be a meteor, streaking from west to east.  Please see video on NUFORC homepage.
