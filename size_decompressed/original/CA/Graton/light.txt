Lights moving in strange patterns first from the west and then from the north;2020-10-15 19:50:00;3 hours;Lights moving in strange patterns first from the west and then from the north 15 Oct 2020 UFO sighting outside Santa Rosa California at 19:50 hours  At 19:50 hours I saw three lights in the western sky, far away, probably near the California coast or over the Pacific Ocean.  The white, pink, and red lights always stayed very close together moving independently of each other and moving as a group “buzzing around” much like a bee buzzes around a group of flowers.  Movement was very tight up and down right to left and every so often they would instantly travel a small distance in some direction and then start buzzing again. I called Peter Davenport and now I am filing this report.  I came out at 20:00 hours to witness the same group of lights about the same distance away however they were now much lower right on the horizon.  I came out at 20:30 hours and did not see the lights in the western sky anymore, and turning around I now saw this same cluster of lights in the northern sky above Cobb Mountain and the Geysers, where there is geothermal activity and electrical power plants using the steam from the Geysers to power the turbines to produce electricity.;38.4295;-122.8671
