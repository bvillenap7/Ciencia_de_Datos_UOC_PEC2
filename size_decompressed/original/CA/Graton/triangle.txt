Triangular Lights;2004-05-09 00:05:00;3-4 seconds;Triangular Lights A few minutes past midnight I was outside in my yard looking at the stars hoping to maybe see a falling star.It was a perfectly clear night with no moon or street lights. I noticed one star-sized point of light moving in the western part of the sky moving south, then noticed there were three lights forming a triangle,no stars visible between the lights.It moved quite slowly and whether in formation or part of one object I couldn't tell.Could not estimate the altitude.It then just faded very quickly as if it maybe turned and the lights were no longer pointing at the ground. No noise and lights did not blink,just steady white lights.;38.4295;-122.8671
