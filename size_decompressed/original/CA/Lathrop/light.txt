Formation of floating lights in Thanksgiving night sky;2011-11-24 20:45:00;15 minutes;Formation of floating lights in Thanksgiving night sky This report is in response to your segment on Coast to Coast AM on Thanksgiving night concerning the red/orange lights in the sky. On Thanksgiving night November 24, 2011 at around 2030-2045 I stepped outside my house to go to work as a night security guard.  In the Eastern sky over Lathrop CA and headed toward Manteca CA the next city over, there were about 8-10 red lights in formation floating in the sky.  It seemed that the lights were moving slowly West to East. At first I tried to rationalize the lights as Asian Sky Lanterns but all of the lights moved in formation like a flock of birds and always maintained the same speed and interval. My neighbor also saw the lights, though I cannot say that he was sober that night.  Hopefully this report is part of a bigger puzzle from that night.;37.8203;-121.2804
