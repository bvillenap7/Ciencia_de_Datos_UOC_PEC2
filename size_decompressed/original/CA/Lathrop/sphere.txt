Two ufo's sighted over Lathrop CA at 10pm.;2020-12-04 22:08:00;5min;Two ufo's sighted over Lathrop CA at 10pm. I was heading upstairs at 10am when I spoted a light outside the second floor window. I saw that it was hovering in the air and had movement so I called for my wife and my brother to come see it.I took a picture and called my friend in the phone to come upstairs. We watched it move North West slowly but changing speeds and altitude. It dimmed the further it got from us until it disappeared after about 1min of me catching sight of it. My friend got upstairs and missed the first one. 1 min or 2 later a second one appears in the same spot hovers and then starts to move West. It slowly moves and has bigger changes in altitude towards the end as it also dimms away, lasting about 30sec. Winds were 3.4MPH South East that night.;37.8203;-121.2804
