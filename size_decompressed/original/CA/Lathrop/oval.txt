Strange Star viewed under cloud cover...;2011-12-11 04:00:00;5 minutes;Strange Star viewed under cloud cover... On December 11th 2011 at approximately 4:00am we were leaving Lathrop, California to go fishing at a local Lake in Foothills East of Manteca.   As we were getting into truck we looked up Southwest direction and saw one of those sparkling stars that flashes different colors. I know what is said regarding what causes this but this time it was the only star seen in the sky due to the cloud cover???   Last month I watched one, then after it got light out I had to use binoculars. I watched it intermittently from 5:00am until 8:00am which had not moved the whole time from Vallejo, California.  Looked like it was over Suisun Bay near Travis Air Force Base.;37.8203;-121.2804
