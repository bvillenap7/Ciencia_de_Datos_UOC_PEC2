the object got so bright we actually thought it would explode;2010-08-28 19:43:00;5min;my wife and i went driving to the store, and we stooped at a red light. then we saw a bright red light. it looked like a disk with fire in the sky. well we kept driving till we reached the store, and to my amazement the fire looking disk was still there. we looked south in the sky. the object began to move slowly down then stop then it appeared to disapere then reaper around the same place we first saw it. i knew it wasn't a anything from the airport because it moved like it was from a star-wars movie. at the end the object got so bright we actually thought it would explode and it looked like it did, but it turned into six blue lights in the sky, the blue lights sat in the sky all night.;37.8203;-121.2804
