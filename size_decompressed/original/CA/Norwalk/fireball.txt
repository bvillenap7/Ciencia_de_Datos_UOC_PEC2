I called my Boyfriend over to see this.  A big light that was red/orange was flying or hovering slowly.  It seemed to be heading south east.  It was steady than it would flicker bright than normally. Than again bright than normally.  And than it just disappeared.  It was moving horizontally not diagonally like a shooting star.  It looked like a fireball.
