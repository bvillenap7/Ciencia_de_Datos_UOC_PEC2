On a warm evening as i was visting two neibhoring friend's.A female of whom i had just met there was a visiter as well.At about 17:15 hrs.we sat down on a drivway step to talk and smoke a cigarette facing south towards the ocean.Then suddenly out of nowhere i had noticed something appear to the nothernside only feet away from us.apparently uncloaking itself hovering somewhat silently over the gaurage. As i stood up to get a more direct look the vehicle vanished as to recloak. The person that was there sitting next to me apparently had not seen it or did not want to say anything about it to me.I had asked a friend of whom had just came out side.Did you see that,He replied what, are you yelling about.I explained,I just had seen a ufo.He did not believe me.The female that was there had left somewhere.i had stayed the night and about 3:45 am I had awoke to tell my self to go out side and look in the back yard below where i had seen the ufo hovering.Then there was that picticular female laying on her back on the ground facing upwards with her eyes opened.I had asked what she was doing?She appeared to not know.But, she was just there.I invited her in to go to sleep.The incident was never talked about again. All the people soon after that,had all died in a row in three homes even their pets. An as far as i know i am the only one to see that sighting.approx 75 to 100 ft away.

V formation cloud in the night sky that moved and kept it's shape.;2015-09-27 21:00:00;30 minutes;V formation cloud in the night sky that moved and kept it's shape. I was outside at this time ( 21:00 ) and saw a large V shaped cloud, the other clouds around it were spotty but I could see black trails coming from the (opening of the V ) or what looked like something had dragged through the other spotty clouds ! Three members of my family , besides myself saw it,  (We are: one female age 35, her daughter age 6, a Grandpa age 57 and myself age 56 none of us use drugs or alcohol )  I could not take photos of it. I stayed out to watch it and it moved ( while the other clouds stayed put ) it moved North West in the sky and as it traveled it did not spread apart or lose formation of the V!  It took about 1/2 hour to move from right above me to what appeared to be three blocks over, still keeping its formation !  And the other clouds stayed in the sky not moving at all !;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
Strange Lights in the Night Sky.;2015-10-11 05:30:00;1+ hours;Strange Lights in the Night Sky I had glanced up at the sky around 2100 yesterday and again at around midnight and were only able to see a handful of dimly lit stars.  I couldn't see Orion's belt or even the North Star.   I also could not locate the International Space Station.  At approximately 0530 I laid down on a couch we have next to a big sliding window that leads to the pool in the back yard.  The window faces east.  That is when I first took notice of the bright light hovering in the distance. The light was very bright and had an unmistakable sparkle to it. I was looking directly at it expecting for it to move but nothing was happening.  Around 0600 a second light, relatively dim, but with the same sort of shape and sparkle appeared far in the distance to the East.  I then noticed that, at least the original light I had spotted was actually moving west, albeit ever so slowly. I grabbed my iPhone and took some pictures and a short, 1 minute video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKPx65li2VU    By 0630 the original light had moved past the upper boundary of the sliding window and it was no longer visible to me from my vantage point.  But it was still there.  I know this because every so often I would get up and move my body closer to the window as I stretched my neck looking for it. I was looking at the second light, wondering what these things could be. Suddenly, I see what I can only describe as a triangle shaped ball of fire moving from south to north, or left to right of my window.  My first thought was that this was the original light I had been looking at because it was just as bright, perhaps brighter.  It moved quickly and left my field of view in a matter of seconds.  I jumped to my feet to get a better look  where it was heading.  It is not difficult to spot a bright light in the early morning sky.  I followed it attentively as it traveled north and then it simply disappeared.  Gone. Just like that.  Almost as if someone had hit the light switch. I blinked a couple of times.  It was gone.  I found myself disappointed for not having captured it on video.  The sky was starting to turn blue by this time and the two original lights I had been looking at seemed to be the only bright objects in the sky.  I went inside, grabbed my iPhone and shot a couple of pictures.  I continued looking at these lights until the morning sun made them disappear.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
