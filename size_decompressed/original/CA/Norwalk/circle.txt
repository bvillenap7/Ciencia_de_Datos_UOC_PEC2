I WENT OUT SIDE TO HAVE A CIGARETTE AND LOOK UP IN THE AIR AS I ALWAYS DO. ABOUT NOON HIGH. I SAW A REAL BRIGHT SHINNING CIRCLE OBJECT. IT SEEMED TOBE FLOSTING SLOW, THER WAS NO JET STREAM OR SMOKE BEHIND THE OBJECT.I WATCH IT FOR ABOUT 4-5 MINS. I WAS ABOUT TO GET MY WIFE AND IT TOOK OFFF LIKE A BAT-OUT-HELL. IT WENT EASTWARD, IT REMINDED OF WHAT A SHOOTING STAR GOES BY. I COULD NOT KEEP MY EYES APOND IT. THIS IS THE FIRST SIGHTINGS IN THIS AREA. I AND MY WIFE HAVE SEEN MANY SIGHTINGS AND SOME TIMES WE HAVE SEEN 2-6 OBJECTS IN THE SKY IN THE SAME FLI9GHT PATTERNS. I PERSONAL HAVE SEEN AT LEAST 20-30 SIGHTINGS A YEAR. I NEVER KNEW HOW TO TELL,BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT TO LOCK UP OR BECALL A LAIR OR A LOOSE SCREW IN THE HEAND. I SWARE TO GOD AND TO CHRIST HIMSELF THIS IS A TRUE STATEMENT, AND TO INCLUDE MY WIFE.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
