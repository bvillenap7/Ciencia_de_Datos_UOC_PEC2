Bright Flash greenish blue;2008-07-28 01:45:00;30 seconds;Bright Flash greenish blue It was about 1: 45 am We just finished watching a movie and were getting ready for bed. Our normal routine we take out dogs outside to use the restroom before we lock up and go to bed. So we took our dogs outside. Sitting down on the bench in front of my house looking into the sky.

But nothing appeared.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
