No lights were displayed anywhere on the crafts hence drawing my attention. They  made an unusual maneuver which no aircraft usually makes. They appeared to turn end over end then straighten out and instead of traveling together as Military aircraft do, these were sandwiched together and moved indistinguishable of one another. Because it was night it was difficult to tell if it was a single ship or two traveling together. They were enormous and moved without making a sound. An approximate distance from where I stood was about 1500' and their size although hard to gage, was about 50 to 75 in length. They moved out of view without any further incident.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
