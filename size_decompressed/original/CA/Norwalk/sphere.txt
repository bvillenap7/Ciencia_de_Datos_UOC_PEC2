Single craft that changed color and direction before disappearing into space.;2009-01-05 00:52:00;7 min;Single craft that changed color and direction before disappearing into space. At approx. 12:52 am on the morning of January 5th 2009 I saw what I at first believed to be Jupiter in the sky directly above the Los Angeles area.  After quickly going to get my binoculars I realized that the object was moving.  My next thought was this was possibly a comet or possibly a meteor (at this point I believe the object had a faint tail).  I ran inside to call my Father, still not realising what I was seeing.  It was then that I realized the object was changing in color (originally a orange-red) from a blue to a white (white being the smallest the object appeared and orange-red the largest the object appeared).  Almost immediately after I noticed the object changing color it quickly changed direction from an approximately eastern course to an approximately western course.  The object then changed direction and color a few more times before at exctly 12:59am changing direction one final time towards the stars until the object getting smaller and smaller disappeared.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
Sphere shaped firework over Norwalk;2009-09-24 22:13:00;Still there;Sphere shaped firework over Norwalk On 7/26/01 we first saw the unexplained object hoovering up in the sky there were 2 I thought nothing of it until my daughter said it was freaky because it would not move so I went to look and yes for about 15 minutes they just hovered we went to the front yard to just look at them one came real close to our home after about an hour it cane down hovered then soon after just shot up into the sky they both disapeared. It was so strange and scary I didn't know what to do so I called the news no answer I called the Air Force they said it was nothing but yet 2 minutes later 2 jets flew over. I was pregnant at the time and you hear so many stories I was afraid that maybe they were here for the baby. I stayed up all night alerted by every sound not knowing what it was. By the morning no news of any sightings were on any news channels. I did not go to work because I started having light contractions. Me and my children were the only ones out there and the next day I gave birth I was still worried about so called abductions when I was sent back to my room my baby wasn't with ne I started to panic and asked the nurse said the doctor would come talk to me. I was terrified not knowing until I asked to see my baby he was in ccu he had a few medical issues water in the lungs and would need to stay a few days. I always wondered if it was because of that night. My kids tease my son that he is an alien baby or we call them our friends now. Tonight my dog made a weird noise that made me look out the window and the object is up there I went outside to get a closer look because it had moved to fast and it was gone. I still see some flashing lights up in the sky and wonder if it's the same object. It looks like a sphere flashing red lights with white like whe a firework is set off and it spins. I know that there are lots of weird things but this time I don't know I wish someone else shared the same sighting. I will wait and see if anyone will ever see the same thing we have seen and what it is or if it wants something.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
3 witnesses reported 2 speeding helicopters chasing a white orb northbound over Norwalk, CA.;2014-11-13 18:25:00;2 minutes;3 witnesses reported 2 speeding helicopters chasing a white orb northbound over Norwalk, CA. Seemed to have been a military operation involving 2 helicopters flying really low overhead the 605 freeway.  The two helicopters were chasing a white orb.  All 3 craft were really close to each other, about 100-200 feet separate making a triangle formation with the orb leading.  All craft were heading north bound.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
