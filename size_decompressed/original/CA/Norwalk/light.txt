Thanksgiving evening about 10 p.m. 9 objects were seen up in the sky making up different formations and changing from yellow to red. At one point two of the objects got side by side. The objects moved from left to right then would go straight and dissappear for a few seconds then come back down and reappear. All but 1 vanashed after about 15min. The last one flew slowly towards the west.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
Bright red light crashed to ground over Los Angeles County Area;2003-12-23 19:22:00;8 minutes;Bright red light crashed to ground over Los Angeles County Area We spotted it at 7:22 pm, tuesday, dec. 23, 2003.The light was very bright red, redder than the light on a plane flying by.Red was the only thing we could see, so bright you couldnt see the body of the object. It was moving what we thought was unusually slow for a plane.It was moving in a northwestern direction, more north, then it appeared to stop in mid-air for about 5 seconds then it changed directions and headed in a western direction, in the direction of the Los Angeles international airport.  But it started gaining altitude rapidly as it was getting lighter and lighter.  Then at 7:28 it suddenly started falling out of the sky toward the ground in a straight line down.  The light was flickering on and off as if an engine was struggling to turn on.  But the light didnt flicker in a pattern.  I lost sight of it falling but I continued to follow it in the direction it was falling and it reappeard still falling and flickering.  I would describe the flickering as if someone was turning on a light off and on rapidly and sporadically.  I contacted the FAA emergency line but they werent helpfull at all. I contacted 4 MAJOR Los Angeles tv news stations and they werent helpful either. I also called Edwards Air Force Base and they gave me the number for the UFO center and told me they couldnt help me anymore.  I dont know how radar could not have tracked this thing because there were other planes around everywhere and it fell out of the sky to the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Pulsating Magenta light over L.A. County;2005-12-03 19:15:00;3 to 5 min;Pulsating Magenta light over L.A. County On Saturday evening December 3rd, 2005 at 19:15 p.m. driving towards Hollywood on the 5 freeway just before the 605 freeway over the Norwalk area I spotted a bright magenta colored light to the left in the sky about the 10 o'clock position.   I asked my girl What is that! as I pointed up in the sky.  She looked down and out the windshield as I also looked out the side window.  The light was pulsating, like no other.  It  was not a helicopter nor a plane.   Above the bright magenta light was a smaller dim white light that was visible every other second.  As we drove north on the 5 freeway the object seemed to stay stationary and we were slowly passing it.  Just as it was about even with my shoulder straight up, the bright magenta light fell from the sky like a rock and got brighter as it approached the ground.  We could no longer see the object.  It became blocked by a distant freeway wall.  This sighting lasted about 3 - 5 minutes.   I must say this is the most amazing thing I have ever seen in the sky to this day.  I am a subscriber to UFO Magazine and know quite a bit about UFO's.  This I beleive was one. I also have read reports about this exact type of sighting before.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
Red flare type light over Los Angeles Area;2006-03-10 19:00:00;20 minutes;Red flare type light over Los Angeles Area At approximately 7:00 P.M. I witnessed a Red (flare type) Light traveling in an easterly direction. When I first saw the object it was to the west of the Norwalk area where I live in the direction of Long Beach. I thought it might be a helicopter at first but it had only a bright red light (not typical aircraft lighting).  As I am quite familar with aircraft lighting I knew this was not a typical aircraft as no green or white light was visible anytime during my observation. The object passed to the south of me (no sound was heard at any time) traveling at about a normal aircraft speed until it was a few miles directly to the east at which time it stopped.  It appeared to by approximatly at about 3000 to 5000 feet. As the moon was shining brightly I could see that it had stopped between two clouds.  It remaining in this position for about 10 minutes.  I called my son outside at this time and we took several photographs of the object with his digital camera and 400 mm zoom lens.  The photos appear as a bright flare type light. After about 10 minutes the object then began to continue east. It began to flash several time and moved away at a extremely fast speed (faster than any aircraft I have seen before.  It was out of sight within 10 seconds and appeared to go down but may have just been moving away to the east at the high speed. This ended our sighting.  As my son is an amatuer aviation photograper and private pilot we are quite familiar with watching aircraft but this was like nothing we have ever seen before.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
A bright, red, occasionally blinking object in the northeastern sky observed for about 15 minutes.;2006-04-22 20:30:00;15 Minutes;A bright, red, occasionally blinking object in the northeastern sky observed for about 15 minutes. I pulled into my driveway and as I got out of car I noticed a bright red light in the northeastern sky.  I continued to watch it for about 5 minutes and it did not move. I went into the house and got my daughter.  We went into the backyard and continued to observe it for about 15 minutes. She called her grandparents and I called my sister to see if they could see it.  We watched a bright, red light that was stationery in sky for about 10 minutes.  Occasionally,it would brighten then dim out.  We noticed after about 10 minutes that it was moving slowly.  The only way we could see that it was moving was it had changed positions in the sky. (relative to the telephone wires) We contined to watch until it dimmed and finally disappeared. My daughters grandmother, father and two cousins also confirmed that had witnessed this. My sister who lives in a town about 14 miles away also saw it.  It was very strange and none of us had been drinking.  I am a 50 year old female who works in a hospital. My daughter is a 23 year old graduate student. My sister is a realtor. My daughters grandmother is retired, her father is a contruction worker and her two cousins are teenagers.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
The object looked like a star until I noticed it was moving. The object also outshined every star in the sky!;2008-04-17 00:05:00;25 - 30 mins;The object looked like a star until I noticed it was moving. The object also outshined every star in the sky! The object appeared to be a star until I noticed that it was slowly drifting. Questioning what I am seeing I compared it to other nearby stars, but the object not only outshined the all the stars in the sky, it was also the largest in sight. The object was glowing like a star, but the color was different. The object was located near the horizon. The morning glare near the horizon blocked out all the stars near it exept for the object. That led me to believe that whatever this thing is, its not a star because the morning glare would of blocked it out. Immediately I ran into my room, picked up the camera, ran back outside and recorded the object on tape.  At the rate the object was moving, it would of taken more than a couple of hours for it to leave my range of sight. I repeatedly watched the footage for the past three months trying to find a reasonable explination only to be left with questions. I also tried to recreate the incident at a later date using the largest and brightest star in the sky. I was unable to duplicate the incident because the star was obviously stationary. So finally, I decided to report the incident.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
Red Light Making Physically Impossible Movements for An Aircraft Witnessed By Three People.;2008-08-13 21:00:00;five (5) minutes;Red Light Making Physically Impossible Movements for An Aircraft Witnessed By Three People. UFO Report  First of all, I would like to state that I have been infatuated with the skies since my earliest memories. I am intelligent enough to differentiate between all standard aircraft (i.e. commercial jets, helicopters, Cessna’s), satellites, and explainable natural phenomena (i.e. meteor showers). The reason I am writing this report at this time is because I listen to the radio show “Coast to Coast AM” with George Noory. Mr. Peter Davenport was a guest on the late evening of June 20th 2012. He stated to a caller during the show that it was his Christmas wish that everyone with a legitimate story turn in a report regardless of when it happened. On a warm evening approximately four years ago my friend, girlfriend, and I were in my backyard enjoying the evening and talking. I noticed and pointed out a solid red light that I determined was moving abnormally fast for any standard aircraft that I have witnessed. As soon as both my friend and girlfriend both noticed the object that I was pointing out, the object instantly switched trajectory from a “southeast to northwest” line of flight to a vertical ascension which was very quick. When this happened everybody cried out “whoaaaa” because it was so startling. All of a sudden the light came to a complete stop in its ascension. We all confirmed with each other that we were witnessing the same thing.  As one could imagine we were very excited! The object started a violently fast descension straight toward the ground and disappeared well before it would have impacted the ground.

about 8 different shaped, circular lights. moving slow across norwalk, ca;2010-05-26 23:25:00;5 seconds;about 8 different shaped, circular lights. moving slow across norwalk, ca 05/26/2010 11:25 p.m. I was laying down, my husband was on his computer. I seen, I don’t know what type of air craft it was, most planes have lights flashing on them. This object I seen had light that ran straight across, they were like a faded yellow color, and they were not flashing. The lights were different sizes, i know they were more than 5, id say about 8 lights total. It was flying really low… it was moving really slow, almost hovering.. after a few seconds, it was gone. Usually when you hear a plane go by, you would hear its engines as well. I heard nothing… it was quiet. but I also saw a trail that followed behind it. A trail that looks like a smoke cloud, going across the sky. The same trail a plane leaves behind when flyng way above the sky, their trails also are mostly straight and a constant line. This trail wasn’t straight, it formed a strange shape and wasn’t a constant line, it was thick as well towards the end and curved upwards at the end. Also, the trail was close, it wasn't way above the sky. I told my husband I saw a ufo, he didn’t believe me  he did admit he saw a strange trail of smoke riding across the sky that was at a strange close range.  I was thinking it was a jet maybe, but jets are loud. And usually don’t fly this low at this time of day. this was not a jet, nor a plane.  I wonder if anyone else saw something tonight.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
White spot over the CA skies;2011-08-08 17:00:00;4 minutes;White spot over the CA skies I spotted a shiny object in the sky in a south-eastern direction from my location.  Speck was spotted 17:00 hundred hours on 08-08-2011.   Object was stationary for about 2 minutes.  Then proceeded to move in a southerly direction.   Friend saw it and joked saying it was a balloon.  I explained it couldn't have been one since I would have seen it float across the sky.  I had been looking at that part of the sky before going into the house.   About 2 minutes later I returned to the same spot and spotted the stationary shiny object in the sky.   Then, with the aid of Barska 20x50 binoculars, I could make out a shiny speck.
