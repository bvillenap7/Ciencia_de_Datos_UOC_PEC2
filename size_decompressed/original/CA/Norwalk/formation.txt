The crafts were then doing different manuvers and were silent and fast. The news papers reported that it was cold air colliding with warm air but this was not the case. they were some kind of blimp like shapes with bright lights moving fast. I took video of it and told the local news but wer'nt intrested.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
