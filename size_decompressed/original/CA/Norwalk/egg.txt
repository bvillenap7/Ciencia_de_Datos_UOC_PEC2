UFOs Norwalk California;2020-07-31 15:38:00;2 hours 40 minutes;UFOs Norwalk California July 31st, 2020, At about 3:38 pm. I was cleaning my pool in my backyard when one of my children came out to see if the pool was ready (I was already out there for about 30 minutes) the time was about 3:38pm when something caught my attention in the sky above us.  There was this white sphere the was just hovering there at the high noon, in the sky.  I first got my cellphone to take pictures then record video.  But after a few minutes I needed something better to get a closer look at the object. I told my child to get my high zoom digital camera and then I started afterwards to take pictures and videos.  There was one main white sphere/egg object, multiple small shiny objects moving or shooting around the sky  randomly, another white sphere like object but small and one white/greenish sphere.  The main object would stay in one spot for a few minutes then would move at a creeping pace then stop again. It did that for the rest of the sighting.  At one time there was a shiny small object going down next to the main obj! ect then make a 90 degree turn upward. After that it made another slight turn then disappeared. I was recording at that point and the camera went out of focus. It kept moving west from the east towards to horizon (sunset area). At about 6:20pm before I went inside the house the main object disappeared at about 30 degrees from the horizon to the west. All of that happened in that time frame. My whole family was witness to the event.;33.9097485294117;-118.071635477942
