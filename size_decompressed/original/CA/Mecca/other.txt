Very bright just appeared then more appeared out of nowhere.;2016-01-13 20:11:00;Unsure;Very bright just appeared then more appeared out of nowhere. It was my friend and I in my backyard we where talking.  It was a cold clear night sky, you can see everything.  I have a thing of always looking up in the because you never know what you might see.  Well, back to the point.   I was looking at the sky looking southeast I didn't see anything that got my attention, so I turn around to talk to my friend.  As fast as I turn around to talk to him, something inside of me told me to turn around again, so I did.  As soon as I turned around, there was these bright light in sky.  I mean way to bright to be a star, plane, flare and etc.. So that light got my attention real quick so I asked my friend was that light there right now he said no I said thought so.  So we start looking at it then these one its by it self in the sky and another one just appears out of no where.  We didn't see any tail like you would see if it's a flare going up.   At this time my phone is inside charging, so I run inside to go it.  Come back outside, start recording it my phone had a little bit of charge, so I recorded a little video with my phone.  Then my phone died.  Tell me what you think.   Thank you;33.545;-116.0187
