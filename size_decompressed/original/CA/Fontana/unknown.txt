UFO over San Bernardino Mountains;2006-03-22 13:30:00;15 minutes;UFO over San Bernardino Mountains I saw a craft today 03/22/06 around 13:30 over the San Bernardino mountains just standing still flashing a light on an off as in sunlight being reflected on a mirror or ship to ship code signaling. It did this for over 15 minutes before a jetliner flew below it leaving a chemtrail which turned very quickly into a linear cloud, which hid the object from view.  The only day I leave my camera behind, and this happens.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666

I though;2009-11-19 02:00:00;20;I was going to open the door of my truck, parked in our driveway, when suddenly a light beam appeared aimed at me from behind. I thought it was one of those police helicopters. A little surprised and upset, I turned around, looked up and I saw this fireball, that seemed to me was not moving. This lasted for maybe ten seconds. And it dissapeared. To me it seemed the fireball was not far from the rooftop of the house across the street. I did not notice any form of a craft, but only the fireball because I was terrified. During the first day after it happened, I thought I might have seen a meteorite or astroid that exploded. But this one was not moving fast and it did not cause a trail.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666
Four rectangular lights moving up and down like a snake would travel.  ((anonymous report));2018-05-03 21:30:00;15 seconds;Four rectangular lights moving up and down like a snake would travel. On the night of 05/03/2018, I saw two sightings, both times the shape of the light emitted from the object was the same. First one was heading north as me and my friend looked eastward. The second we were facing south and the object was heading west.  The light was 4 rectangle lights going up and down like a snake slithering.  It looked like notes on music sheets dancing in sync up and down. I was with a friend and we both confirmed what we just witnessed to ourselves.
