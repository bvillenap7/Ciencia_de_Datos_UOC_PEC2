UFO in near I 15 near Fontana.;2009-01-18 20:55:00;1;UFO in near I 15 near Fontana. Driving on highway 15 heading south, We spotted an object to the far left of the highway blinking bright violet and kinda orange light. Ontario Airport was to the far east but this object appear not to be moving toward it or away from it. We stopped on the side of the rode near the 60 E exit. The object did not appear to be moving in any direction just stationary. My wife and I both concluded that it was not a plane or helicopter because it did not have a blinking red light or have alot of white light around it. In addition if it were a police helicopter, you would see a spot light if it was trying to search for something, not in this case.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666
