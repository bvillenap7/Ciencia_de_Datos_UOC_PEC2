My brother and I saw 3 lights forming a shape of a triangle;1997-08-25 22:00:00;15 sec.;My brother and I saw 3 lights forming a shape of a triangle I was on the roof with my brother, fixing our TV antenna, when we seen 3 whitish-yellowish lights in a triangle shape coming from the other side of the San Bernardino mountains northeast of us.The lights rotated clockwise but stayed in unison.Next they spread out but stayed in a triangle shape as to form a larger triangle.After that the lights shrunk back down to its original size. Then they rotated a few more times in unison then sped off with such an incredible speed that I have never seen before in my life.

Triangle over Fontana, Ca.;2019-07-04 20:30:00;1 minute;Triangle over Fontana, Ca. While lighting fireworks and watching neighbors fireworks in the sky I seen what was the shape of a triangle coming from the NE.  At 8pm there was still enough light to make out aircraft that was in route to Ontario airport or an nother destination, and they were frequently moving at a predetermined amount of time, I could see the helicopters flying in and out infrequently, but you could tell they where helicopters, a couple of low flying private planes could also be seen, but then I seen a triangle moving in from the NE then turning and going south.  The group wasn't moving fast and was pretty quiet compared to all the FW's that was going off.  I looked in my truck looking for my binoculars it wasn't there and I wasn't carrying my phone.  So I moved to a darker area to focus on those aircraft, and I could make out bands on the wings, I want to say they that they had two green bands, one on each wing, but it was dark and what they were escorting was a very bright! golden/yellow craft that I could not make out completely but that it was very bright and leading the two escort jets, and they headed south.  From my perspective if you hold you two fingers in the air, arm extended, and leave a gap of about an inch, that's approx how close they were.  My only fault is I didn't record anything.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666
