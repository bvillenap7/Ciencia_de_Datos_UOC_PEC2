Diamond Shaped Objects in Broad Daylight;2014-06-12 06:20:00;1 minute;Diamond Shaped Objects in Broad Daylight Driving to work in broad daylight, it was a bit smoggy, but it looked like the object was flying under the smog.   Too low to be a plane, and was two diamond shapes all black connected, it was no way it could be a helicopter.   I looked up and had to take a double look.  It was much faster.  Truly amazed.
