It's shape was of a saucer and it hoovered slowly over the city as if it were looking for something or just plainly sightseeing. We were in our car and started following it at one point we came so close to it (about a 3 block distance) that there is no doubt in our minds that this was a UFO.   It then started to fly a little faster and started going eastward towards San Bernardino, it became hard for us to continue following it, and unfortunenately we didn't have a camera with us to prove to anyone that we did see this. It was an ahhhing experience and has erased any doubts in our minds that they do exist.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666
