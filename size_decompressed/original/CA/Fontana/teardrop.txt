Small metalic teardrop shape object that made a parallel front-back movement.;2012-07-19 11:00:00;Approx. 8-10 min.;Small metalic teardrop shape object that made a parallel front-back movement. The object I saw was through my window, it made like some type of parallel front and back movement (slowly) then suddenly disappeared.  It made this same movement one more time before disappearing once again.  It had a sliverish metalic shiny color.  It was not an airplane or a helicopter beacause it made no noise.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666
