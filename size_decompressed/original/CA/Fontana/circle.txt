Dark round object flying low having no lights and making no sounds.;2000-08-05 22:00:00;1 minute;Dark round object flying low having no lights and making no sounds. My neighbor and I were out a little after 10pm with binoculars looking at satilites as they passed overhead. I looked to the West toward Los Angeles and saw a dark object that was round in shape, actually oval at distance,  flying slowly at low altitude almost due East. I looked through the binoculars and saw nothing other than it's dark round shape. There were no lights, sounds or sensation as it passed overhead. I keep looking at it with the binoculars till it was out of sight. I have not seen this object before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

2 Bright Orange Lights Over Fontana.;2012-03-25 20:30:00;15-25 minutes;2 Bright Orange Lights Over Fontana. I went outside to walk my girlfriend to her car, while I looked towards the Moon and seen a Orange Brightly Lit Object in the sky moving like a plane, but with none of the usual blinking red/blue lights you see from an airplane.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend as the object passed thru the sky and vanished into the clouds.  For some reason, I went outside a second time, looked towards the same direction towards the moon and I seen another object following the same path as the other, and that's when I pulled out camera.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666

An odd bubble like unidentified, but seen by the naked eye appeared close to moon during Super Moon Eclipse.;2015-09-28 00:00:00;20 minutes;An odd bubble like unidentified, but seen by the naked eye appeared close to moon during Super Moon Eclipse. A friend and I were trying to get some good photos of the Supermoon Lunar Eclipse on Sept. 28th, around midnight.  We were out on the balcony of our apartment and were using both my cell phone for pics and his out dated telescope to try to possibly take some nice pics of this cool event. I downloaded 3 applications that would possibly have a telescopic or zoom affect on my phone for odvious reasons..the camera is terrible for far away pics.  During this period of pics taken I did not use my friends telescope to capture photos ..only my phone. The applications were a telescopic for telescope pics( can attach cell to telescope physically) and a so called filter or night vision app. and an app that flip flops dark and light..whatever the object being photographed the whiter or lighter colored object is reversed to black and the black object is reversed to white (easier to see in dark conditions). I started to take pics noticing an odd bubble like object that kind of bounced in front of the huge glowing moon.  It would be in front of the moon for a second..then to the right side diagonally and then in front like it was closer to me.  This lasted about 15 min.'s. In the beginning I thought maybe it was my camera reflecting the brightness of the illuminated moon. I wiped the lense over and over.  The object was still the same shape and continued to become clearer.  It appeared to look like a star when I looked by eye and when I looked through the camera on my phone, which was magnified it looked to be a clearish blue-tinted bubble and then turned a pale pink. I believe there were two objects but the other disappeared and I was only able to really capture this single object.  The photos are taken with 3 seperate apps but same cell phone. I cannot say what this was that I saw and I have no opinion to voice. My friend and I were wondering if anyone else could shed some light on this very cool occurance.  So glad I was able to share my pics. Thank you.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666
