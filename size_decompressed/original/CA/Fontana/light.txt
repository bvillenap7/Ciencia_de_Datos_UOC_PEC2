The light disappeared into the sky aft;1990-07-01 23:00:00;3 to 5 minutes;Summary : A bright light in the shy that seem like chopper's light however without any sound or movement.  The light disappeared into the sky after about two minutes. Back in 1990,  I was going home around 11:00 P.M. and witnessed a police car stopping a car while I was waiting for a signal light to turn green.  As I passed the police car,  I noticed a bright light above the police car at 60 degree angle and coming from a western direction.  At first,  I though it was a police chopper serving as a back up to the police car.  However, after looking at it for a couple of seconds I did not notice any characterisitcs of a chopper.  In other words,  the police chopper was not doing its typical circular patterns that is common to see when looking at a cop chopper, and it was not shining it's strong bright light on any thing on the ground.  A block later I got home and got out of my Jeep to find two neighbors looking at the object.  However, minutes later the bright light disappeared into the night sky.  Although, at the time I was a college student and it was a Saturday night,  I was not drunk or had any to drink that night.  I was sober and total!ly awake.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666

Object traveling high speed from an westerly to a southerly direction at a 90 degree angle.  No disruption in speed.;1995-03-15 20:30:00;5 seconds;Object traveling high speed from an westerly to a southerly direction at a 90 degree angle.  No disruption in speed. Between February and April 1995, as I was leaving for work (CHP Officer) around 2030 hours, I was getting into my truck, which was parking facing in a southerly direction.  As I was entering the door of my vehicle, I glanced up to the south and observed a rapidly moving, star like object, traveling in a westerly direction. I continued to watch the object for 2 to 3 seconds, at which point it abruptly changed directions, without slowing and continued in a southerly direction.  The object appeared to be headed away from earth and was out of sight in another 2 or 3 seconds.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666

Glowing light;2008-03-07 12:00:00;10 minutes;Glowing light It was a sunny day, with just a few clouds in the sky.  I was sitting in the backyard of my mothers house, when I looked up, and saw, above the house behind her back fence, what appeared at first to me to be either a plastic shopping bag floating to the south.  As I watched it I began to think realize that it was unlikely something like that could be that high and still in the air.  Then I thought maybe it was a white balloon, but it was glowing white.  I followed it with my eyes as it ascended, still bearing south, up into the clouds, but it never dimmed and maintained the bright glow. Then seemed to change it's shape as it turned to go west.  It was completely silent.  Once the turn was complete, it regained it's original, round/oval shape. I ran into the house as it passed my view and told my brother to hurry and come into the front yard with me.  We both ran out into the front yard, and both witnessed it acsend higher and higher into the sky, appearing more like a bright star in midday.  As we continued to watch it, it dissapeared into the atmosphere... I had never really believed in UFO's, although open minded to it.  I have been looking at UFO videos, and many of the UFO's caught on video are exactly like the one I saw.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666
Just not the same as a jet landing in Ontario airport.;2010-02-16 19:51:00;4:10;Just not the same as a jet landing in Ontario airport. Sighting was traveling from North west to east south.  Almost paralell with the 10 Fwy about 3 miles north of fwy.  It had a bright red light that did blink below a white light. above the white light was another red light that blinked only going over certain areas.   At one point there was a sparkling light that did travel from the white light to the red light on top.   Mind you this is not a plane, jet, or helicopter.  The red light on top would have been at least 3 to 4 stories high from the white light and the red light never blinked in the same spot above the white light.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666
Lights on the sky evry night;2011-08-17 21:00:00;1 MIN.;Lights on the sky evry night For quite some time my family and I, have been watching these lights across the night sky, they appear on a daily bases. The objects seem to have some sort of intelligense since they move in a zig zag motion, which is why I discarted them from being meteorites or satellites. I live near an airport(5 miles)it can easily be seing that they're not planes, in fact when a plane comes near one of this objects they dimn down or completely disappear.  When two of the objects come across each other on of them flashes a bright blue light before dissapearing. These objects we been spotting on everynight from 3 or 4, a night to 11 even 13. We do not believe this objects to be military, they're to fast and sometimes at a very high altitud.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666
White light moved like shooting star till it shoot back then way it came 1 man shocked by what he just saw;2017-05-24 01:30:00;33 seconds;White light moved like shooting star till it shoot back then way it came 1 man shocked by what he just saw I was outside having final cigarette before going to bed, I always look at the stars at night, I noticed what appeared to be a shooting star, the closer it came the brighter it got, I was getting excited cause it looked like it was go to pass over me, that would be the first time that happen, but it shoot back in the way it came in a flash.  Never seen anything like it.  No plane moves that fast so it is a unidentified flying object.   I still don't know how to wrap my mind around what I just saw.  I'm so sorry to all the UFO people I doubted and laughed at. If your seeing regularly then all I can say is wow;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666
