I witnessed a bright orange what at first glance appeared to be a planet or star in the Northern sky.  Within seconds it began to fade away.  When it was almost completely gone another object which looked like a shooting star passed directly beneath horizontaly.  I have perfect vision & know what I saw was not a figment of my imagination.;34.0848272202999;-117.449294463666
