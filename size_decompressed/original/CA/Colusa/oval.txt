A friend filmed it on his video camera and gave it to him after the game.  Sunday morning he was watching the plays in slow motion and he called us in to the living room to watch this unidentifiable object streak across the screen.  He slowed it down to frame by frame and there is no denying it!  It is not a plane or a jet or a helicopter, etc.!  By comparing the player's action in the freeze frame it is the time he lifts his leg at a full run and partially steps down.  It isn't an aircraft.  One of my co-workers says it is light infraction from the lens of the camera, but I don't think so.  We never would have seen it if he hadn't been in slow-mo and if he hadn't seen it!;39.2339;-122.0227
