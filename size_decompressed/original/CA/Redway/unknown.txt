Super bright flash;2013-02-12 19:00:00;30-45 seconds;Super bright flash I was sitting on the porch staring up into the stars and a big flash caught my eye, i tried to follow the object but it was very faint at times. then a bigger flash and a very fast movement.  It was changing its direction almost constantly. I have seen this similar thing probably 3 or 4 times in the last few years.  Anyone else?;40.1235;-123.8207
