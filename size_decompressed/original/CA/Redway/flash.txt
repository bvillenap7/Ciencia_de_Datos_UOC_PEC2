The power went out for a second, then came back on. Then I seen a the sky out side turn a bright green and the power when out again.  I wasn't able to get a good look it was just a flash of green, then the power was off.  I have an eerie feeling now, and I am sorry if this is not the place to post  I am just wondering if anyone else has seen it, if you feel I have waited your time I truly apologize;40.1235;-123.8207
