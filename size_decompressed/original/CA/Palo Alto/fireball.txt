Falling Ball of Fire on Sand Hill Road 9pm 3/11/09  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2009-03-11 21:00:00;approx 2 sec;Falling Ball of Fire on Sand Hill Road 9pm 3/11/09 Driving west{?} on Sand hill Road to hwy 280 I observed what at first I thought was a falling star.  It came from the left traveling very fast & at a strange angle across the sky.  It was a very large bright colorful ball of fire & became brighter as it passed before me.  It had an unusual bright long thick tail & disappeared over the hill.  At the next red light I asked the man in the car next to me if he saw that.  He was just as awestruck!  That was an amazing & exciting experience.  ps I don't think that was a star! ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));37.4419253906251;-122.142439453125
