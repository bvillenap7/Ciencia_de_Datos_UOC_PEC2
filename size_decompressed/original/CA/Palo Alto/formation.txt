Several V-Shpaed Formations of Amber glowing craft float across the night sky;2004-12-15 05:00:00;34 Minutes;Several V-Shaped Formations of Amber glowing craft float across the night sky My wife and I woke up shortly before 5:00 AM because for some reason we both could not sleep.  I opened the balcony window and looked into the clear night's sky.  Within seconds I noticed an amber glowing flying formation floating across the sky heading north west, towards the Direction of the Stanford University Dish.  I immediately called for my wife who watched with me as this formations shape changed ever so slightly from a v-shaped into a straight line, and back into a v shaped formation.  The formation was made of several dots, they could have all been part of 1 craft or perhaps they were each an individual craft.  I immediately ran for my Sony Digital Night Shot video camera and ran outside in the freezing night and attempted to catch the craft on video.  My wife followed as we watched several more formations float across the sky.  Each formation was made up several dots and all had a white/amber glow and resemble flocks of flying geese.  There was no noise, and each formation was visible for aproximately 10-15 seconds before going out of view.    Each formation seemed to be followed by a smaller formation right behind it.  I attempted to film and am reviewing the footage now to see if the camera picked up the faint images.  My wife and I have had several sightings of these formations since November 18, 2001 when we witnessed dozens of the same types of craft fly overhead.  Our most recent sighting was this past september of a pulsating Triangle which changed shape and size 3 times.  Moffett Field / NASA Aames Research Center is aproximately 10 Miles south of our location, and we are only a few miles away from the Stanford University Dish.  They always seem to fly in the same direction.  This wave lasted till aproximately 5:30AM.  FYI: We noticed a couple of shooting stars, most likely from the meteor shower. We also find it interesting that these formations appear during Meteor Showers.  I would like to encourage investigators to look into the November 18, 2001 Mass Boomerang Shaped Sightings that occured during the Leonid Meteor Showers, and which my wife and I continue to see fly directly over our house.  I have no doubt they will appear again, we seem to be in thier flight path.  They always fly in the same direction every time we see them, and it's been several times since 2001.;37.4419253906251;-122.142439453125
V shaped formation floats across sky,;2004-12-23 01:00:00;15 Seconds;V shaped formation floats across sky, I was walking back home from a Midnight Snack at the local Gas Station.  I was one block away from my house when I saw the all too familiar Boomerang Formation floating across the night sky slowly, and silently.  The shape shifted from a Y formation, to a classic Chevron shape as it passed by.  I tried to follow the formation, but after a block or two it disappeared from my vision.  Total time aproximately 15 Seconds.  I ran back home to wake my wife, who has witnessed these formations several times since November 18, 2001. However, she was fast asleep, so I went out with my video camera and stood across the street in a local park where there is no light.  I scanned the sky to see if more formations would occur.  Almost as expected, within minutes another Formation appeared, it was coming from the South, and heading North West. In all my sightings, they always come from the same direction.  I suspect that I might live in the flight path of something.  The craft appear to be very high in altitude and very difficult for my video camera to capture.  The formation was a V formation that floated across the sky silently.  The moon was bright and after about 15 seconds I lost site of the formation.  I waited a few minutes to see if more would pass by, then I came inside to write this report.;37.4419253906251;-122.142439453125
Dozens of Boomerang/V Shaped Formations Floating in the sky from 2:00am-5:00am on 11/20/2005 Witnessed by 4 People.;2005-11-20 02:00:00;5 Minutes;Dozens of Boomerang/V Shaped Formations Floating in the sky from 2:00am-5:00am on 11/20/2005 Witnessed by 4 People. Went outside to take out the trash at 2:00 AM.  It was a clear night sky with a bright moon.  I scanned the sky for several minutes as I always do, ever since my wife and I witnessed a sighting on November 18, 2001.  I spent about 5 minutes scanning the sky an then, out of the corner of my eye I noticed a formation of objects with a dim/amber/reddish glow float across the sky silently in a boomerang shaped formation.  The formation was heading North West.  Visible for aproximately 15 seconds before going out my line of sight.  As I continued to scan the sky - there were several formations of amber glowing objects floating across the sky. One formation after the other.  Some in perfect V shaped formation, other formations of various sizes.  At one point you could go so far as to describe it as fleets of formations....  I ran inside my house to alert my wife.  It took about 30 seconds for me to get her off the computer, and run outside to the front of our house and when we looked up in the sky more formations were floating across the sky.  Literally dozens of ambering glowing formations in several minutes.  We stayed outside for 30 more minutes but did not see any more objects in the sky, so my wife went back inside I continued to scan the skys, but also went back inside after a few more minutes of non-activity.  At 4:00 AM I had an urge to go check outside again, and within 20 seconds of viewing the night sky from my porch a giant Formation in perfect V shape formation floated beneath the moonlight sky.  I observed this for 15 seconds before the formation blended into the night sky.  I told my wife, and I went back outside.  In the next 15 minutes I saw 2 more formations float by.  At 4:15 AM my 21 year old son and his friend came outside to see what I was doing. I greeted them in the front yard, and told them I was scanning the sky for formations.  Our son had witnessed these objects with my wife, and I back in February of 2005. And within minutes 1 smaller formation of objects floated across the sky, as witnessed by my self, my son, and his friend. His friend was completely in awe of what he caught a glimpse of.  We scanned the sky for a few minutes before going back inside at 4:30 AM.  At 5:00AM I checked again from my balcony and observed another V Shaped/Boomerang Shaped Amber glowing formation of objects float across the sky.  These Formations/Boomerang Objects have been witnessed several times before since November 18, 2001.  One of the reasons I was scanning the Sky tonight was because I had a feeling the sighting my wife and I had in November of 2001 would repeat...and it looks like it did, albeit not as intense as it was on November 18, 2001 .... but still a pretty good show by whatever those boomerang/formations are...;37.4419253906251;-122.142439453125
Boomerang Type Craft with Lights in Formation Seen Flying over Palo Alto, Ca  on Saturday Night.;2014-01-11 21:05:00;10 seconds;Boomerang Type Craft with Lights in Formation Seen Flying over Palo Alto, Ca  on Saturday Night I was standing out side my apartment complex on Saturday night and decided to walk toward my wife's car at around 905pm in our complex parking lot, and for some reason decided to look up at the night sky to just observe the stars and moon.  The moment I looked up I happened to see a black boomerang type craft with 5 or 6 dim lights in formation fly over head at a constant velocity or speed, it was moving rather quickly but smoothly through the sky heading South West from Palo Alto.  It did not make any noise at all,  However, I could some how faintly see the black glossy structure of the craft and the lights that were in formation.  I knew immediately it was a craft of some kind because I could see the black glossy structure, the height of the craft and the constant speed at which it was moving.  It was gone out of my sight and view in less than 10 seconds, but it sure did get my attention.;37.4419253906251;-122.142439453125
