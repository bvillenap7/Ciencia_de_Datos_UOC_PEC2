Bright blue oval-shaped glowing object hovering then proceeding downward;2001-11-25 20:45:00;5 seconds?;Bright blue oval-shaped glowing object hovering then proceeding downward My friend and I were driving west along Campus Drive on the Stanford University campus, heading toward the campus exit at Junipero Serra Blvd.  It was approximately 8:45 p.m.  Suddenly, through the car's dashboard, we both saw an oval-shaped, hazy-glowing bright blue object in the sky, directly in front of us, perhaps 5000-10,000 feet above the ground(?)(i.e., much lower than a plane's cruising altitude) .  It hovered for a few seconds in the sky and then proceeded rapidly downward and disappeared behind some trees.  It looked like it landed within a mile or two beyond Junipero Serra, but we did not investigate it further.  Also, it seemed like it left a faint trail as it descended downward, but this disappeared.  We were astonished this bright blue thing did not resemble a plane, meteor, or any other object that we have ever seen in the sky before.  I have seen random lights and other things that I couldn't readily identify before, but nothing that I have ever felt the urge to report on a UFO site.  What made this different was that the entire object was blue and glowing (i.e., it was not like a plane with lights on its wings or tail), and the straight downward path was unlike any other flight path that I have seen. Observers:  my companion, female, late 20s, microbiology PhD student at Stanford myself, female, early 30s, attorney.  No prior UFO reporting or researching in our backgrounds. ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports of the same event from the Bay Area.  We suspect the object was a meteor, but that is only a guess.  PD));37.4419253906251;-122.142439453125
