A large amber ball of light responding to spotlight.;1976-06-22 01:00:00;15-30 min;A large amber ball of light responding to spotlight. I will finally write what we saw. My partner and I worked swing shifts most of our lives and would comute from Woodside, Ca. to Boulder Creek, Ca. every night for 20 years or so. Skyline Blvd is a road on the highest point of mountain range that divides the ocean from the bay area.  One can see both the ocean (Pescadaro beach [a few miles north of Santa Cruz, Ca.] to Halfmoon bay)and bay area (San Jose, Ca. to San Francisco on a clear night). On our way home that morning on a beautiful clear nignt with the moon reflecting from the ocean and shining on the bay area, we saw a large amber ball of light rising from the ocean around Pescadero beach area about 15 miles from the top of the ridge (one can see the waves hit the beach) We were on Skyline Blvd around Palo Alto county. I told my partner to stop so we could observe this object.  He didn't want to, so I (as passanger) removed the car keys from ignition which made the car stop in a turn out with a clear view on both sides of the range.  This object came toward us about 200 yards away and appr. 100 feet above us and stopped.  Our Landcruiser had a spotlight on top of roof, so I signaled directly to this object SOS and this object would respond moving slowly up, down, sideways, diaganal, the return to it spot.  I repeated this signal many, many times and this large amber ball of light would respond the same way each time for about 15-30minutes.  Then all of a sudden it went straight up out of sight within a second leaving a com-trail.  Of course with no sound. I have two more incidences which are very interesting around the same area if you are interested. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

4 lights, similar to those viewed near Stanford on 9/29/03;2003-09-23 19:15:00;15 minutes;4 lights, similar to those viewed near Stanford on 9/29/03 Upon reading of the observed event on this date, I wanted to add that I saw something very similar a few years back at the same general location. Four orange lights were involved, but this time I observed them moving toward each other, as on a collision course towards a central point.  Their location was off 280, near the radio telescope.  A more detailed report can be provided on request. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a more detailed report.  The date shown above apparently is not the date that the objects were sighted.

4 big bright lights hovering over Stanford university area...changing formation...top one arched away and disappeared. Seen from 280 fr;2003-09-29 19:15:00;1 hour;4 big bright lights hovering over Stanford university area...changing formation...top one arched away and disappeared. Seen from 280 freeway going south by my husband...he called me and I grabbed my camera jumper in the car and viewed them (orange) driving north. Sadly no film in camera. I saw them orange...my husband white. Maybe because sun was setting and viewed from different directions 20 minuets apart. copters and planes near ...many people must of seen as cars were slowing on the freeway and people were out of there cars on side roads viewing. When I turned on my camera I got a good shockâ€¦that never happened before.;37.4419253906251;-122.142439453125

Silent, red and blue lights, hovering, circling then dropping fast.;2011-05-10 00:00:00;3 minutes;Silent, red and blue lights, hovering, circling then dropping fast. We were sitting in the backyard hot tub, around midnight, when we saw bright blue and red lights in the sky.  No actually craft was seen in the darkness.   It came in toward our neighborhood, hovered silently, circled around silently and then dropped straight down at a very fast rate of speed.  It then went away from our neighborhood into the open space behind our house.  Maybe about 3 minutes total.

We noticed a craft that did not look like an airplane.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;10 minutes;A group of us were standing at Gunn High School, Palo Alto.  We noticed a craft that did not look like an airplane.  It emitted a spray.  At first we thought the spray was light.  The trail extended over several miles and was illuminated.  It was very dark and we could see the illuminated spray against the night sky  We considered that it might be a pesticide, but the craft was too high in the sky for that.
