After a few seconds, it disappeared completely My wife and I were taking some photos at the Montebello Open Space Preserve near Palo  Alto, CA, while waiting for the sun to go down (we are amateur astronomers).  I saw an airliner in the sky and decided to take some pictures of it.  While looking through the camera's viewfinder I saw something just behind the airliner, which appeared to be following it briefly.  Then it started moving away fairly quickly.  It didn't appear to be dropping from the airliner, since it was moving away in an almost horizontal line.  It was white or silver in color, and appeared to be round in shape.  After a few seconds the object just vanished.  I have several photos of the area of sky the airliner was flying in which show it before the object appeared, the airliner with the object, and the airliner after the object disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with this witness, and find him to be quite credible.  He has provided several photos, one of which indicates a small, luminous object, that appears in the clear sky to the left of a commercial jet airliner.  The case is under investigation.

Bright luminous spherical moon size object much faster than airplane descending southwest under the clouds in Palo Alto, CA;2007-04-04 06:05:00;3 seconds;Bright luminous spherical moon size object much faster than airplane descending southwest under the clouds in Palo Alto, CA I was driving south on Charleston street toward El Camino Real. A round white illuminated spherical object apparently was falling down from the sky…but not straight down. The object was about the size of the moon, it moved fast, much faster than an airplane. I saw it for a few seconds only as it disappeared in the fog below the clouds. The object was on my right hand side. It looked like it was headed southwest toward either the Dish or Stanford area. I didn’t hear any sound.;37.4419253906251;-122.142439453125
