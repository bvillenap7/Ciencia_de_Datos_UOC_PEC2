It was a red, non-blinking light, hovering at a great altitude.  It was too high to see any structural detail.  It seemed to be circling slowly.   When airplanes headed in that direction, the thing would move off at an extremely high rate of speed.  When the airplane moved away, the thing would move back in, again at a high rate of speed.  After about 10 or 15 minutes, it left the area for good, again at a very high rate of speed, much faster than a helicopter or airplane.;37.4419253906251;-122.142439453125
