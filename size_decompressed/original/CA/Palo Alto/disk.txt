Hovering bright disc;2000-12-15 09:00:00;1 minute;Hovering bright disc Going south on Freeway 101, observed a very bright shiny object (metalic looking) hovering over the Black Mountains towards the west. Like a disc cross section, thicker in the middle and thinner on the sides. Clouds passed in front of it. I could detect portions of it behind the clouds, but then disappeared. First I thought it might be an airplane turning and reflecting sun's light at certain angel of rotation, but did not change shape.;37.4419253906251;-122.142439453125
I sitted an image in the sky.;2003-11-28 17:35:00;10 sec.;I sitted an image in the sky. I don't want to research, chat, talk about, listen to stories, learn the history, know or get information about who or where, what, it or they are...  I just want to report want I saw something PERIOD...  Reason being, If there is an agency that records these sort of things, here is my imput.  This is the first time I have ever seen an object or this kind of an image in the sky.  On 11/28/003, approximately 5:35 p.m., In Palo Alto, California, I was driving North-West (towards Stanford University) on Embarrcadero. When I got into the left hand lane in order to turn onto Middlefield Road, I saw an image of a large round, well lit object in the sky that was moving. I believe that this object would have been somewhere in the (over) vacinaty of Redwood City, San Carlos, or perhaps South San Francisco. It shocked me. However, I remained calm, turned left on Middlefield Road and just disregarded at just one of those things. Maybe it's true or not.  Once again, I do not wish to be contacted about this.  Thank you for your time,  ((name deleted));37.4419253906251;-122.142439453125
Disk-shaped object with red/blue/green lights flowing left to right that appeared to stop and become a horizontal bar of light.;2013-10-30 21:20:00;1-2 minutes;Disk-shaped object with red/blue/green lights flowing left to right that appeared to stop and become a horizontal bar of light. I saw a flat, roundish object at about 400 feet above the trees on the east side of the 280 freeway.  Color flowed across it from left to right - red, green, blue. I watched for about 30 seconds when it turned west and appeared to stop - the bands of color then became static and looked like a horizontal bar of color floating in the air.  I drove past and couldn't see it in my rear view mirror.  A drone?  Some sort of weird advertising float?  It was moving fairly quickly, so not sure.  Very strange.;37.4419253906251;-122.142439453125
