Huge rectangle crossed the sky.;2012-12-26 20:00:00;5 seconds;Huge rectangle crossed the sky While standing on my balcony at approximately 8pm, I witnessed a huge rectangle moving very quickly in the sky in a north-northwest direction.  The rectangle had no lights but appeared to be visible by  the light of the moon which was to the south of the rectangle.  The object appeared suddenly and travelled at a faster speed than any aircraft I have ever seen.  From my vantage point, the rectangle appeared flat and crossed my viewpoint in just a few seconds.  It was many many times larger than an aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));35.0954;-120.611
