Strange Red lights over Irwindale, Ca.;2014-12-21 23:45:00;15-20 minutes;Strange Red lights over Irwindale, Ca. Three red burning lights, brighter than the brightest stars.  I was walking from Pasadena to Temple City and caught the 3 what first looked like flares at the end of a star in the  eastern sky over Irwindale Ca..  I watched as one flashed and ascended straight up, changing to a light color with sections.  It then dimmed and went dark in its ascent. The other 2 stayed stationary for a few minutes before moving into a line.  One moving in a lower position behind the higher one in a direct line heading up.  They both flashed a couple of times in multi colors returning to red. The first rose and  changed to a light color as the first had, it dimmed and rose till dark. The third followed the 2 previous in its slow changing and vanishing act from the night sky, in the same direction and spot of complete darken of lights.;34.0943915032679;-118.091665359478
