It was traveling in a straight line and then went backwards. An incident stated by my 18 year old son and his two friends. This was a very pussling incident and one that they cannot explain. As they were lying on a trampoline, the three were looking at the stars. They say one star beyond the rest which was moving in a straight line. They speculated a falling star, ruled that out because it was traveling in a straight line. They decided it was a satellite however the star stopped moving. To thier astonishment it began to travel backwards. I was told they could not believe thier eyes, they went to call thier friends. By the time they looked back up the star was gone. This incident left an impression on them especially since their interests are not about UFO's. It left me puzzled also as my son who is a quiet person could not stop talking about thier sighting.;34.0943915032679;-118.091665359478
