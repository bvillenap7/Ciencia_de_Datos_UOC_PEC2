Freeway UFO sighting.;2017-11-18 01:45:00;2-3 minutes;Freeway UFO sighting Driving down 10 west freeway, multiple vehicles on the road (includes a big rig in front of me).  What I thought was a helicopter N. of the freeway doing its circular motion, all of a sudden was drifting in a Southward motion, also had a streak of light behind it which in no way appeared to be a spotlight.  I would like to say it was a triangle, but it looked more as a half triangle.   Other vehicles noticed as well, since they started to slow down almost to a full stop on the freeway as well as myself, I would say anywhere from 10 to 15 vehicles on the road,.  The object was getting more and more visible as it proceeded to hover over us.  The big rig in front of me was somewhat panicked and pulled over in such a way that I thought there was going to be a pileup collision.   The object was hovering faster, and brighter, then poof, the light dimmed suddenly, it took a mild SW bound turn and headed toward the clouds but it could still be seen as a faint light wit! hin the clouds.   Hopeful there are more reports regarding this matter, and in NO WAY was this a plane heading for LAX.;34.0943915032679;-118.091665359478
