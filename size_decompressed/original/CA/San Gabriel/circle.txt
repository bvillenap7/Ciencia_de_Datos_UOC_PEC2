Comet looking object appears and fades over southern California sky.;2003-12-02 02:02:00;1 minute;Comet looking object appears and fades over southern California sky. The object, which appeared to be a bright light in the South/Southwestern sky, was slowly travelling East.  The unusual part about it is that it left a broad trail, appearing to look like a comet, but was obviously moving too fast to be one--not that it moved very fast, but a comet does not make progress across the background of the sky at a measurable pace in a minute.;34.0943915032679;-118.091665359478
((HOAX??))  Space crafts seen circling my backyard.  They seemed friendly in manner and did not mean any harm.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-20 23:00:00;1 hour;Space crafts seen circling my backyard.  They seemed friendly in manner and did not mean any harm.  If you live in the San Gabriel Valley, please go outside and look at the sky between the hours of 9pm - 1am this week and you can confirm that you see them too.  We aren't crazy.  They mean no harm.  But they understand that humans can't comprehend that they even exist, due to dogma that's conditioned us to believe we are going crazy if we do actually see them.   They are circular ships that are somewhat silent with a flashing white and red light.  If you see them, don't be alarmed, they are just trying to show that they do exist and probably preparing for later contact that will verify this.  Happy hunting.

It was at around 9pm at night.  One was slightly higher than the other and they almost looked like huge circular flame balls in the sky.  We suddenly saw the two slowly start flickering, and then they just disappeared in front of our eyes.  Right after the two disappeared, a third one came along and was hovering much quicker in the same direction as the other two, and then disappeared in the exact same spot.   We have video footage of this and are curious as to what it could have been.   Did anybody else witness this??;34.0943915032679;-118.091665359478
