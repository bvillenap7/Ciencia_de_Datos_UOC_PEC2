Extremely fast right red liight, sphere in shape;2017-07-13 20:45:00;15 minutes;Extremely fast right red liight, sphere in shape Approximately between 8:30pm and 9pm, I witnessed a red rounded very bright light that I am estimating was between Las Tunas Dr. and Huntington Dr. (North and South) and between Rosemead Bl. and San Gabriel Bl. (East and West), in the city of San Gabriel.  It rose from the ground, so to speak, and shot up into, where with distance to the eye became smaller.  It stayed up in the air for a few seconds then dropped down about half way and then began to drop a few feet at a time.  Then flew to the east rapidly, then I lost sight of it for about one minute.  It rose into view once more and returned to where it began and repeated a similar action of dropping a few feet at a time.  There was NO sound of a helicopter or airplane.  No sound at all.  It was silent.   I just got a new cell and could not get the video to work!!  I was talking with my daughter and just kept saying “Oh my god, I cannot believe this!!”  Please if anyone else saw this, post here!!;34.0943915032679;-118.091665359478
