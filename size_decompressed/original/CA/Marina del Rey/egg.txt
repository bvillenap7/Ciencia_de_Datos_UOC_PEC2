Guess what.;2020-05-21 19:30:00;10 minutes;Guess what. I was outside the coffee bean.. about 30 minutes ago. 1930hrs.. PST. At maxella and Glencoe, marina Del rey. CA. As a Chinese lady friend was chatting with me... as I was looking off to the west.  Something caught my eye that made me think It was a high flying police helicopter coming in from the beach direction. It was in a hover/stationary yet slooooooow..moving inland... Yet giving off no rotor blade buzz. So I fixed my gaze on it.. it was maybe 4000 feet..I could not tell. As it moved closer.. I thought quad copter since I saw [one] red light under it. The longer i gazed...it appeared like a black ball or sphere/egg shaped to my eyes.  I called Ellaine to look.. she did not spot it. So I called another person I know who within 20feet of me.  I told him.. look up there. As I pointed in the area above By the time he came over.  The object..?? ***POOF*** Gone!!;33.9778999999999;-118.4525
