One minutes later a fifth one appeared. The lights fluctuated from bright white to amber to red. The scene was almost exactly identical to footage we found taken in Moscow last year. Two of the lights seem to swivel around each other in a somewhat playful manner. Then as quickly as we noticed them, they slowly dimmed out of sight. Three, then one, then the last. I've never seen anything like it, and only wish I could have experienced it for a longer duration.;33.9778999999999;-118.4525

I'm pretty sure it was the most unexplainable thing I have ever seen! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.9778999999999;-118.4525
