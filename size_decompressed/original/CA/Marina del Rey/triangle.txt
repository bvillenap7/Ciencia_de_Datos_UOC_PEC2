Aircraft with no lights flying over Marina Del Rey, CA at 8:30 PM 04-29-2015.;2015-04-29 20:30:00;30 seconds;Aircraft with no lights flying over Marina Del Rey, CA at 8:30 PM 04-29-2015 I was outside looking up at the moon when I spotted a triangular craft flying across the sky.  At first I thought it was a low flying plane, but then I realized there were no lights at all.   I live near LAX so there were a lot of other aircraft in the sky at the time, but I've never seen anything without lights.   Also, it appeared to be dark brown in color, and had 2 small spheres attached to it's sides.   I could not tell if there was any sound since there was a large truck nearby running a very loud pump.
