Just above the low cloud line. It was 11:01PM.  I was sitting in my back yard facing the ocean.  I live on the Mar Vista Marina Del Rey border.   All of a sudden I notice a round shape flying north/East. The best way I can describe the direction is, it had to have traveled from the ocean, over the Marina and it headed towards Centinella.  It was just above the low clouds.  At first I thought it had to be a baloon. However it was flying at a stable altitude and if flew over me and was traveling at a Cruising speed. It had no sound.  It was a round craft.  It had no lights, it was white or light grey in color.  It had just stopped raining and the clouds were seperated. This made it glow from the moon light. I have never seen anything like that. It was like watching a sci-fi movie.  A perfect round disc with no sound just cruzing accross the sky.  Pretty weird and unusual.;33.9778999999999;-118.4525
