A triangle formation of satelites moving apparently very high and fast.;2001-05-11 22:48:00;2 min;A triangle formation of satelites moving apparently very high and fast. What appeared to be 3 satellites, flying very high (as one would see normal satellites) flying in a triangle formation, with lead light at point of triangle, flying from directly above to the south.  Movement not quite as smooth or as fast as satellites normally travel, nor quite as bright either. No sound, no flashing lights. Have had a response from one previous Operation Blue Book Air Force officer, who stated you saw what you saw, it was not aircraft nor a satellite.  You are one of the lucky few. ??? ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect this report may describe three U.S. Navy satellites, referrred to as N.O.S.S. satellites.  There are several other entries for dates during the preceding weeks.
