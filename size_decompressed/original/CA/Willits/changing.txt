Two Orbs spinning in a flipping motion across sky.;1990-07-15 13:00:00;15 seconds;Two Orbs spinning in a flipping motion across sky. I would like to report something I witness when I was a about 13 years old.  It was summer time, and I was in a friends backyard playing.  When my little brother noticed something flying in the sky over our town.  It struck us as strange, cause it made no noise, and flew funny.  It flew like a football when kicked, end over end style.    But it was like two orbs stuck together.  The two orb shapes would seem to separate, then come back together as it flew.  It was very reflective. Silver in color. My Brother and Two friends watched it for about 15 seconds till it passed from view behind trees that obscured our view.  It was north of our location, and flying in an easterly direction.   Never seen anything like it sense then, and it still is very clear in my mind.  Bright clear day, middle of the afternoon, and my brother recalls the same thing. Thanks for listening ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
