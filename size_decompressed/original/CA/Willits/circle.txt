Black spot, killed digital camera;2005-04-24 12:00:00;about 2 min;Black spot, killed digital camera I was walking through my yard when i heard a high pitched sound, sort of like the sound you hear when you frist turn on a TV,  I looked up (thats where the sound came from) and I saw what I thought was a jet plane, we see planes a lot in this area, they fly so high that all one can see is a sliver dot.  But this on was pitch black and it was moving extremly fast from north to south.  I ran to my house and got my camera (a sony digital). I got back to find that the object was almost out of sight and now it was moving in the oposite direction, it had changed corse.  I got it in the viewfinder of the camera a took about 25 pictures in rapid secetion.  I would have i was about to take more when the camera registered that the flash memory card was full, this card was a 512mb and could hold almost 180 pics.  I watch the object until it was out of sight and then I went into my house and looked at the pictures. all of them showed a bright white light with a trail of smaller lights behind it.  All other pictures I have taken sence then with that camera have had a blueish spot in the center ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD));39.4493;-123.3679
