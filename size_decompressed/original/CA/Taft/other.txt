Six navy like ships going east to west, and one cloaked;2010-07-15 22:00:00;10-15 seconds;Six navy like ships going east to west and one cloaked In the summer of 2010 in Taft, California, I was looking through night vision glasses and saw six ships (a cross between a destroyer and aircraft carrier).  They were going from east to west.  I could only see three at a time because they were so large and low in altitude.   Each set of three was in a chevron formation.  When I looked back at the first formation, the ship at the top disappeared.  I think it cloaked because where the ship was there was a difference in the grey color of the sky.  There were irregular sparkling areas around the outside edge of the grey color.  The ships were moving fast, it was only 10-15 seconds that I saw them through the night vision glasses.  My husband was standing next to me and he could not see them without glasses.  By the time he took the glasses the ships were out of sight.  We heard no noise. I think these ships could be part of our secret space program. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.1496;-119.4618
