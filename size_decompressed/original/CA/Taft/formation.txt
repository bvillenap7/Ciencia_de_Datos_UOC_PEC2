Elliptical objects in skies over Taft, CA sighted in the afternoon;2007-09-15 15:00:00;30mins onwards;Elliptical objects in skies over Taft, CA sighted in the afternoon A group of skydivers, including two professional pilots, at 3pm in the afternoon saw four white objects in the sky - very high, one pilot estimated 40 to 50,000 feet.  When observed with binoculars the objects appeared elliptical in shape and greyish white. The four objects appeared to move in geometrical formations, at first in a straight line, then forming a square, a triangle of sorts and then a straight line again. Everyone observed the objects for half an hour - then decided to go back to skydiving as the objects continued to move in formations, but did not appear to move closer or further away.;35.1496;-119.4618
