APROX  3,000 FT       MOVING SWIFTLY IN A N.W. DIR. COLOR  'BRILLIANT' ORANGE        SPEED  UNKNOWN. NO SOUND.       2 OBJECTS  TRAILING APROX  10 MILES BEHIND A LEADING OBJECT.    THE 2 TRAILING OBJECTS MERGED TOGETHER, THEN SEPERATED.    ALL 3 OBJECTS DISAPPEARED AT SAME TIME.   SIZE OF OBJECTS  COULD NOT BE DETERMINED, BUT APPEARED TO BE MUCH LARGER THAN A PASSENGER PLANE WOULD AT SAME ALT.     THESE DETERMINATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE AS PILOTS AND YACHTSMEN.   WE ARE BOTH SENIORS WITH 40 YEARS FLIGHT AND SAILING EXPERIENCE. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the husband, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally eloquent and sober-minded.  Both husband and wife had unusually responsible jobs in the defense community, working on special projects.  PD));35.1496;-119.4618
