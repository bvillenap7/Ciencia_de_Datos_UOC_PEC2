It seemed to be hovering and searching for something.  It had red and white blinking lights blending in with other aircraft, but moved like no aircraft we have, then suddenly changed from red and white lights, to a light blue light, then seemed to land at water and power field on Sheldon and Roscoe St.   Lasted for 3 minutes.   I saw a red orb circle the same area a couple months ago and a couple months before that, i saw a bright white light fly slow over the 405 freeway.  Then disappear in seconds.  Later, navy says they tested a missle over the valley?  It's highly populated. and there was a blue vapor trail that stayed in the sky for an hour or so.;34.2183000000001;-118.3718
