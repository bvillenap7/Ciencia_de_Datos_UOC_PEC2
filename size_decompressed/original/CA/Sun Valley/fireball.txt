I was driving right off the 5 freeway in Sun Valley , around Glenoaks in that area, I was talking on my cell phone and I was looking out of the driver side window southeast towards the mountains and the 5 freeway  while driving north.  I noticed something floating, and glowing a red orange color,  as I looked closer at the object , it looked like nothing I had seen before,  It was a like a fireball there was a redish haze around it, maybe a ball of energy, a floating light of some sort, hard to explain.I kept on driving but ive thought about it ever since.  I would have taken a pictures or a video but I was driving and was talking on my phone, I even told the person on the phone I think I just saw a ufo, it was very strange.;34.2183000000001;-118.3718
