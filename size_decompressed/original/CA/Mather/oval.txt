The object was glowing reddish orange and stopped approx 150 ft from the ground, it had misty trails and an aura/grey haze around it. The craft stopped completely and then changed course moving in a Z motion with extreme speed, again it stopped abruptly and shuddered/vibrated, at this time the craft was at a 45 degree angle to the ground, then the craft changed angle leveling out. The craft made almost no sound but a low humming vibration and was approx 50-60ft long. The craft never changed color or shape and seemed like it was spinning very,very fast.The craft disappeared in an instant leaving a ring of light the shape of the object. Seeing aircraft in the sky around our house is not uncommon as we live directly in back of an old military airfield (Mather airfield), now used for commercial and small passenger aircraft, this craft and encounter was not anything like a plane,jet or helicopter, or aircraft in use in todays technology I took 3 photos, two show the glowing object at the different angles and the third shows a the Z movement, misty trails and a metallic object in the right lower corner. The experience lasted approx 15-20 seconds.;37.8797;-119.8559
