Above is a good description. I was talking to a friend while others were finishing up a volleyball game behind me.  I was facing north, my friend was facing me. I would say the fireball was over La Jolla and I was south near clairmont San Diego.  I said to my friend,look at that! He saw it and was happy I said something about it.  He said you should report that to Art Bell.;32.8433756756757;-117.250881081081
