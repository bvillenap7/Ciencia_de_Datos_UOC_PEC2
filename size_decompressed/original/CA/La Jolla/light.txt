At first i thought it might be a street light, but it appeared to get brighter and then fad a bit. Fot several min it did not seem to move. Then it appeared to move very slow.  It started to either get brighter and bigger or it was coming toward me.  At that point I turned away and headed for home. ((NUFORC Note:  Report may address a planet, perhaps Jupiter, or a landing light on an aircraft in the distance, we believe.  PD));32.8433756756757;-117.250881081081
UFO Sighting in Southern California  I live thirty minutes from the border of Mexico.;2005-01-10 22:00:00;3-4sec;UFO Sighting in Southern California  I live thirty minutes from the border of Mexico. At about 2005, as I was walking my dog late at night, the sky was clear and as I usually do I watch the stars and try to discover new clusters I was looking at a particular set of three stars that were kind of lined up but I new it was not the THREE MARY,  suddenly one of them moved in a triangular sudden move in a speed of a second for each angular move and then nothing I waited stunned for it to move again but nothing at all. I report this only now out of a sense of duty.   I wish I new of this website earlier. UFO CENTER.COM;32.8433756756757;-117.250881081081
Red lights over San Diego.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible party lanterns.  Many other reports.  PD));2008-01-01 00:40:00;5 minutes;Red lights over San Diego While driving over Mt Soledad in La Jolla we spotted a formation of  orange-red lights, each with an apparent size somewhat larger than that of Mars. 7 of the objects moved lower in the sky in a formation that changed over time while two of the objects were almost above us. The objects appeared to move in a South-West direction. We stopped the car on Soledad Mtn Road where several vehicles had already stopped to observe the phenomenon. At this location the lights were very clearly visible for several minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible party lanterns, but that is a guess.  Many other reports.  PD));32.8433756756757;-117.250881081081
Orange balloon-like fireballs traveling upwards and slightly south from the Pacific Ocean and disappearing.;2013-12-31 20:40:00;5-6 minutes;orange balloon-like fireballs traveling upwards and slightly south from the Pacific Ocean and disappearing orange colored balloon-like lights in a line rising slowly as if out of the Pacific Ocean in a slight arc traveling up and slightly southward.  Slight, but noticeable, flashing red and white lights on each one (but mostly static orange color) disappearing out of sight one by one as they rose in altitude until all were gone.  The speed of travel reminded us of the way hot air balloons travel.;32.8433756756757;-117.250881081081
I looked up and saw a vapor trail from a bright moving light. Then suddenly the light turned east.  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket.  PD));2015-11-07 17:55:00;5 minutes;I looked up and saw a vapor trail from a bright moving light.  Then suddenly the light turned east and the light turned into a 5 point flower pedal and emitted what looked like a large smoke ring.  The smoke ring was like fog surrounding the light but huge snd continued to expand rapidly.  Then the center of the smoke appeared a green light or green cloud inside the bigger smoke cloud.  Then the craft let out a smaller white smoke blast and the light disappeared and headed east.  I was on the phone and my friend saw a similar thing from La Mesa.

Perfectly shaped large sphere of light with blue center was slowly moving N. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:15:00;20 minutes;Perfectly shaped large sphere of light with blue center was slowly moving North Tonight above the ocean in La Jolla (Windansea area) I saw a very very large perfectly shaped sphere of light within which another perfectly shaped sphere of light appeared.  It had a blue center, which was slowly spreading.  The orb was moving North and was slowly dissipating.  There was also a very light trace of light, which was to the right of the orb, very slowly moving down towards the ocean.  The blue color remained but the light was by then very dim.  This took ~20 minutes.  And then I had to leave.  I tried to take a photo with the iPhone when the light became dimmer, but it wouldnâ€™t show on the phone...  Many people were looking at that on the street wondering what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.
