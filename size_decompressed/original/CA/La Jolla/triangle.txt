Initial sighting on 09/11/99, commenced when girlfriend awoke at 04:05.  We viewed a large (size of two-story building) triangular-shaped set of three milky-white lights approximately 100 yards distant.  Have since photogaphed objects nearly every night until 10/30/99.  Photographs reveal multiple objects, extraordinary flight trajectories, unexplained geometric dotted lines surrounding objects and various colors and beams of light.;32.8433756756757;-117.250881081081
A massive semi-transparent liquid blackish triangular shape;2008-10-29 19:30:00;10 sec;A massive semi-transparent liquid blackish triangular shape with point size white lights at each corner drifted east to west across the sky above Mt. Soledad in La Jolla, California.  It traveled in a straight line at a constant rate of speed.  There were no jerky movements. There was no sound.  The altitude was hard to judge but if it were at 3000 feet I estimate the “wingspan” to be equal to 7 Boeing 737s parked tip to tip.  As it crossed the sky it appeared to “warp” space sort of like heat waves disturbing light waves.;32.8433756756757;-117.250881081081
Hovering craft red, blue, white lights not flashing no sound.;2011-03-29 04:58:00;1 minute;Hovering craft red, blue, white lights not flashing no sound. Hovering craft near the corner of La Jolla Scenic and La Jolla Village Drive (driving east).  Triangle shaped with red, blue, white lights not flashing.  Appeared to be stationary and fairly low (maybe 200 feet high) it was clear and I could clearly see the cresent moon in the east.;32.8433756756757;-117.250881081081
