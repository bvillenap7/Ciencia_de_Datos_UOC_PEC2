u.f.o. siting in la jolla, california;2003-01-18 17:50:00;2 minutes;u.f.o. siting in la jolla, california I was driving on the CA-5 interstate highway and i was on my way to dinner in Los Angeles.  At that point on my drive, I was in La Jolla, California.  I looked up in the sky, and hovering above the hill to the right of me was a U.F.O.  It was enormous. There was no loud sound, because i opened my window to see.  But because of the traffic i had to keep moving with the traffic.  I thought at first that the large object was a blimp and that i was mistaken or perhaps that it was even a plane. But the object was extremely low to the ground and hovered over a local neighborhood.  It was almost a circular shape, but hard to tell because I was trying to look up and out of my windshield in my car.  The U.F.O. had 3 blue light that were placed on the edges of the object and one small red light in the center. This object was way too low to be a plane and was moving very slow in a forward motion, but going south in san diego, while i was going north. I was only able to see the objct for about 1.5 to 2 minutes since i had to pass it in the car.  I was stunned. ((NUFORC Note:  We just spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded quite sincere and credible to us.;32.8433756756757;-117.250881081081
