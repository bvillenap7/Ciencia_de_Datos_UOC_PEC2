The diameter of this light was about two Boeing 747 together, with a sphere shape and light green color also a long white tail about 6 to 8 times the diameter of the light.  The speed was approx. 400 mph (base on commercial jets fly at that area is  200 mph this light was going twice the speed of a commercial jet on approach to Lindbergh  Field) at 500 feet altitude (same altitude with Mount Soledad)). The light was moving with no sound. We decide to go to Mount Soledad and over there we found other 3 people who saw exactly the same light. As a FAA  Licensed Aviation Technician and Engineer on Unmanned aircraft system (R&D) this light was not an advanced aircraft, lighted balloon or any air vehicle.;32.8433756756757;-117.250881081081
