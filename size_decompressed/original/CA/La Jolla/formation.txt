I was on my back deck in La Jolla tonight when I saw formation of lighted objects flying fast overhead (moving east to west).  I only saw them for a few seconds before they disappeared out of view.  They were triangular in shape, but hazy around the edges.  They made no sound at all.  I pointed to the sky, speechless, trying to get my husband to look.  All I could say was Are those birds? because they were flying in formation.  But they were moving too fast.  My husband thought they were shooting stars, but he only saw the last bit of the formation.   By way of background information, my husband and I are both lawyers and we had not been drinking.  I'm a big fan of astronomy and have spent a lot of time looking at the sky over the years.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.;32.8433756756757;-117.250881081081
