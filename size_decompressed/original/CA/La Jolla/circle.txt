Orange glow in the night sky turns out to be a round grey saucer once the glow went out;2012-01-03 19:40:00;3-5 min;Orange glow in the night sky turns out to be a round grey saucer once the glow went out. I am a bus operator and was behind the wheel when I observed a fireball in the sky that appeared to be coming southbound towards me as I traveled northbound.  I had passengers on the bus at the time but pulled over at the next bus stop to see what the object could be.  I stepped off the bus and looked up into the night sky.  The object seemed to kind of fade out once it was directly over me.  I almost felt as if it knew I was watching. It looked as if it disappeared but suddenly re-appeared. This is when I noticed an airplane traveling westbound.  Moments later the glow went out again but this time I kept my eyes on the object and to my surprise, I observed a round grey object moving across the night sky.  I have 20/20 vision so with the moonlight I could see it VERY well.  I can only assume the it was the typical Flying Saucer, but it's clear to me that the fireballs that people see are actually saucers with some type of shield that surrounds the craft.   I have searched on-line for months to see if anyone could collaborate my sighting to no prevail.   This is my second time reporting this online.;32.8433756756757;-117.250881081081
Stationary flickering orange glow, could have been a drone on fire.;2015-04-16 02:30:00;7 minute;Stationary flickering orange glow, could have been a drone on fire. Saw a bright orange glow appear to the east, just over the Miramar Airfield.   It was completely stationary, then it began to flicker and slowly lose altitude. It hovered almost like a drone, but when it glowed orange almost as if it lost control and descended.  Then it began to tumble as if it was on fire.
