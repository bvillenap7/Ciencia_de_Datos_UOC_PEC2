Strange Lights over Mariposa California.;2004-12-09 01:46:00;3 hours;Strange Lights over Mariposa California. I was laying down in the living room getting ready to go to sleep, when my brother came in and looked as though he was going check his e-mail on the computer.  After a few minutes he walked back to his roomI thought he was sleep walking.  After a few minutes he came back and sat down again then he went outside.  He came back in and went back to his room again I thought he was sleepwalking.  When he returned a third time, I asked him what he was doing.  He told me to come outside to see something.  When I got outside he pointed to a bright light that appeared to be hovering over the tree line about 4 miles away.  He then flashe his flashlight at the light and the light moved away from the tree's and shot up the sky at about 40 degrees.  I thought to myself weird!  He then pointed his flashlight at a second light and the same thing occured.  What were these lights.  I am a vet of the U.S. Army worked as an Air Traffic Controller.  I have never seen any aircraft that can do what these strange lights were doing.  I went back into the house to get the cam, but could not locate a tape to record.  I went back outside and my brother was in the back yard observing a different set of lights over the valley.  We live in Mariposa CA just a few miles from Yosemite.  The lights my brother was now observing appeared to get closer when he flashed them with his flashlight.  I was spooked!!!  I returned to the front of the house and observed the 1st lights.  After a hour of observing the lights I went on the internet to research any information of this occuring in this area.  I found what I was looking for right away.  The lights that are recorded on www.sonorasightings.com are the same lights we were observing.  Sonora is just about 1 hour from here, aslo in the Sierra Mountains of California.;37.4931;-119.9269
