UNRECOGNIZED ORB taveling lights!! PLEASE TAKE A LOOK!;2010-10-04 23:54:00;30 minutes;UNRECOGNIZED ORB taveling lights!!  PLEASE TAKE A LOOK! My camera would not capture it on site, but after i reviewed it, it shows the evidence of a round orb roaming quickly in an unorganized fashion. i caught it on film...once. but there was one other time i caught it on film and it was a little different. we decided to catch it on film because the lightening was happening every half a second rather than the normal time, it was strange to us, so once we caught it on tape we got suspicious of what we witnessed. I've seen things on documentaries and this seems some-what familiar to a few things I've seen so i thought maybe i should report it. this was EXTREMELY UNFAMILIAR AND EXCITING to me and my brother! maybe you can take a look at my footage!;37.4931;-119.9269
Two mulicolored Ufo's over Madera, California.;2014-01-21 19:30:00;10 minutes;Two mulicolored Ufo's over Madera, California I live in Mariposa, and last night, Jan. 21 2014, I saw two lights in the direction of Madera.  They looked like those stars that shine blue, red and white.  The one on the left was higher than the one on the right.  I ran into the house and grabbed my binoculars.  The one on the right was higher in the sky, they were moving very slowly.  I watched some more and the one on the left started heading south at a fast rate of speed.  The other one was slowly lowering and then took off in the same direction, also very quickly. I live on a mountain and this is one of many weird things I've seen in the sky, along with the commercial jets and other conventional aircraft.;37.4931;-119.9269
