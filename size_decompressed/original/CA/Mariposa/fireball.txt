I believe that our Long/Latt is this 37W,120N  (I THINK!) We are about 15 miles directly south-west of Yosemite Nat'l Park in California thanks.;37.4931;-119.9269
it appeared to be a meteror entering the earth's atmosphere and was large enough that it may not have completely burned prior to impact;2003-09-04 20:40:00;couple of seconds;it appeared to be a meteror entering the earth's atmosphere and was large enough that it may not have completely burned prior to impact I believe the object was a meteror, however, no current news reports substantiate that observational opinion.  The object entered the atmosphere as a large ball of light (fire?) with a long tail that turned green as it moved rapidly across the horizon from west to east.  It appeared to be in close proximity to northwestern usa.  I don't believe the whole object burned-up before impact which I propose is somewhere within a couple hundred miles of 95338 (Mariposa,CA).;37.4931;-119.9269
At 3:30 AM a bright round object moved in a straight line across the northern sky, west to east, not far above the horizon.;2009-07-02 03:30:00;8 seconds;At 3:30 AM a bright round object moved in a straight line across the northern sky, west to east, not far above the horizon. My dog was making an unusual barking noise, so I went outside to find out why. I saw a bright round object, somewhat less than half the size of the full moon, traveling in what appeared to be a straight line from west to east in the northern sky not far above the horizon and parallel to it. It moved slowly compared to meteorites I've seen, and it left no trail. It did not blink, change size or color. There was no sound.;37.4931;-119.9269
