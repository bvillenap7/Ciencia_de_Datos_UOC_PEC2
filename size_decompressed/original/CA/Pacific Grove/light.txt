At approximately 15:20 PST on Saturday 1/23/10, I noticed a small single white light to the lower left of the moon while walking the Del Monte trail in Pacific Grove, CA.  I asked my son if he could see it & he said yes, that he thought it was a star, and then I noticed more lights to the right side of the moon & counted a total of 17 lights.  I also observed that the lights were moving in small random patterns, some moving what appeared to be very close to each other & eventually they formed something of a line with the left side of the line lower than the right side of the line.  Then the left hand side lights began to disappear one by one.;36.6139;-121.9189
