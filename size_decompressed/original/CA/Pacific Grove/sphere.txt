6 bright orange lights seen on Monterey Bay, moved slowly & silently, then faded and sped away.;2015-01-29 20:00:00;~15 minutes;6 bright orange lights seen on Monterey Bay, moved slowly & silently, then faded and sped away. On the evening of Thursday, January 29, 2015, at about 8 P.M., we saw orange lights over Monterey Bay from our oceanfront house in Pacific Grove, CA. The viewing lasted about 15 minutes. First, two bright orange lights were seen from our window, heading east from the ocean into the Bay.  We went out to our balcony to get a better view, and an additional 4 lights in a vertical diamond formation came into sight.   All lights were bright, steady (no flashing), and moving slowly and silently. They were at a low altitude –maybe 200-500’ above the water.  The first two lights appeared to come together (possibly one moved in front of the other so that only one was visible…), then, after a few seconds, the(ir) light rapidly moved north across the Bay and faded.   The other 4 lights began to fade as they began to move north.  After the orange lights were gone from sight, we could still see tiny dim lights (of red, white, and blue) moving erratically around each other, apparently on the far side of the Bay. At least two small private planes flew near the lights during our observation. It would be interesting to know the observations of the pilots.;36.6139;-121.9189
