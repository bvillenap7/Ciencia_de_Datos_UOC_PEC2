I DO HAVE ONE OTHER EXPERIENCE WITH SEEING A UFO TRAVELING UP HWY 29 TWO MONTHS AGO AS WELL AS TWO PARENTS OF FRIENDS THAT HAVE SEEN UF;2005-03-11 19:15:00;45 seconds;I DO HAVE ONE OTHER EXPERIENCE WITH SEEING A UFO TRAVELING UP HWY 29 TWO MONTHS AGO AS WELL AS TWO PARENTS OF FRIENDS THAT HAVE SEEN UFO'S OR HAVE MADE CONTACT AROUND HWY 29 AND THE NAPA AREA, THESE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT NUFORC AND I DO NOT KNOW IF THEY WOULD TALK, but here is another story.  This is an additional report that was not reported this year. The exact day was the second Friday in March of this year(no calendar handy). These craft may have been military technology. The witness in this incident is the same person with me in the 08-31-05 Kentfield report. Me and my friend were sitting above Pantoll in Muir Woods on Mt. Tam. We had noticed high airline traffic during dusk with jets flying at 10,000 and 30,000ft range traveling north to south which is typical. Two crafts were observed exactly fifteen minutes apart before complete darkness. The first craft was definitely a military jet flying at approximately 60,000 to 70,000 ft leaveing contrails the jet was very quiet but an engine still could be heard and it was painted black. Fifteen minutes later a glowing orange disc was seen on the same exact path as the military jet and was moving at around the same speed which could only be estimated at 2,500 to 3,500 mph. I thought it could have been a test run of the SR-71 and our captured redesigned alien technology at work. This orange craft was slighty higher in altitude and was noiseless and stayed the same color at all different angles and was observed for about 45 seconds.  Note: The craft from the 08-31-05 report was traveling upwards from the ocean and was white/yellow/red verses this craft that was on the same military route and glowing more orange.  Note: The craft from 03-97 was in the upper atmosphere and was traveling north to south along the coast but it was stopping and starting over and over. This craft changed from black(cool to orange to red to white(high speed) and then back to black when it would stop. It did this maybe 20 or 30 times and also had about 30 to 45 seconds of air time before disappearing verses a jet liner that averages 3 to 4 minutes to traverse the sky.
