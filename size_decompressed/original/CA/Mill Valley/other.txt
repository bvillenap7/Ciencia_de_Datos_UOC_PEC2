Possbile UFO Sighting In Marin County California;2009-10-03 22:00:00;20 seconds;Possbile UFO Sighting In Marin County California We (passenger and me) were traveling in an auto, heading west towards Stinson Beach on Panoramic Highway in the vicinity of Mt. Tamalpais State Park.  To the left side of the car, shinning down into a valley, appeared three green (light in color) triangular beams of light, each the same proportion.   At first, we believed the lights were coming from a helicopter.  However, why were they green and triangular?   After about 10 seconds, I stopped the car and rolled down the car windows.  There were no sounds from a helicopter or anything else, only silence.  We could not see what was generating the lights because of the overhead trees.   After approximately 10 more seconds, the lights went out.  Still no sound, only silence.   We could not explain what it was and joked about it being a UFO.  We did not see another car in either direction for the entire 11.4-mile drive. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));37.8940016393443;-122.530442622951
