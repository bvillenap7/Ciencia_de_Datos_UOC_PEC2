My wife, a Registered Nurse, stayed up late one night last year, in our home on a ranch located on top of a hill that gave her a clear unobstructerd view towards the city of San Luis Obispo and beyond. She told me the next morning that she observed a metallic looking object that was oval or egg shaped hovering low over the city.  The object appeared to sense that it was being observed, because it suddenly accelerated at fantastic speed in a Southern direction, disappearing from sight within a few short seconds (Much too fast for any normal aircraft). The object was approx. 6 to 8 miles away.  The night was clear and illuminated by city lights.;35.2618495504498;-120.655285414584
