I was driving northbound on Highway 1 from San Luis Obispo to Morro Bay, California at approximately 8:55 on June 10, 2008. I was just coming up on Hollister Peak to the left side of the freeway. A single cylindrical bright white object flew at an extremely high speed from one side of the mountain (closest to the road) to the opposite side. It then went straight up then shifted trajectory 180 degrees towards the ground. Then it disappeared completely. This occurred in less than 5 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports.
