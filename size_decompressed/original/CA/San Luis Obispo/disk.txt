Hi Peter. I've heard you on Coast to Coast AM over the years.   I took this photograph 4 days ago -- May 28, 2013.  I was taking photographs in a university botanical garden.  See the object in the sky?  I didn't see it when I took the picture.  I just saw it a few minutes ago when I uploaded photos (including this one) from my iPhone to my computer.   It could be anything, but I'm emailing you because it doesn't appear to be a bird.  Rather, it appears to be disc-shaped and possibly metallic, because it looks like it is reflecting light.   I don't have the equipment to blow-up the photograph and otherwise make a determination as to whether this is a natural or artificial object in the sky.  Hopefully you do.  This photograph is looking east, and maybe a tad north.  I'm emailing you at your director@ufocenter.com address with the photograph.  I'd be interested to hear back from you if/when you use whatever means at your disposal to enlarge the image and determine what it i! s.  Thanks.;35.2618495504498;-120.655285414584
A patterned flying object hovers until I completely pass by.;2013-06-13 16:30:00;30 seconds;A patterned flying object hovers until I completely pass by. I was driving with my parents on the highway 101 freeway, when my eye caught sight of a huge saucer about 50 ft long, backing into the clouds.   I could see a pattern of curved lines.  After about 10 sec it was gone. The lines had a pattern similar to some sort of ancient vase. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));35.2618495504498;-120.655285414584
