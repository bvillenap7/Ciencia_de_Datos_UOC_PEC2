bright lights fast percise in movement no noise.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights??  PD));2008-11-21 00:00:00;10-15 min.;bright lights fast percise in movement no noise there were six of them very bright round blue and white like led lights. at first they lined up all six for afew seconds then one would turn to the left and the rest would follow to the left . then they would go in circles around each other then back to six in a row then to right and go into circles. then there would be two then three then four then none. i am not sure what we saw over the mountains towards ocean. we have never seen anything like this. no noise and very fast and so bright.;35.2618495504498;-120.655285414584
I thought was irregular aircraft light however it was flashing like it was made of fire.;2019-02-05 23:08:00;2 minutes;I was watching a video outside and my dog was barking and I could hear a helicopter close and when I looked up I saw what I thought was irregular aircraft light however it was flashing like it was made of fire it was moving across the sky slowly and then it let out a small red flashing light that slowly followed behind it and then stopped in the air the original fire-lite proceeded to what appears to be leaving the atmosphere out into space then eventually the red light stop flashing and disappeared all the while a closed helicopter was hovering with no lights I never saw the helicopter but the second original flashing light is dim out of sight there were several series of rumbles the helicopter with no lights hovered around for another 30 seconds and then slowly left in the opposite direction does the original light had left that in the sphere in.this is the second time that I've seen a glowing flashing light leaves behind red flashing lights and then leave! it's as if something's being dropped off.;35.2618495504498;-120.655285414584
