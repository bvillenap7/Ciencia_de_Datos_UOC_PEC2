Large white object with trailing fire.  ((NUFORC Note:  Multiple witnesses.  Possible bright meteor.  PD));2014-12-29 19:00:00;4 seconds;Large white object with trailing fire. We were driving south on the 101 at the top of the grade at spotted a large white object with fire trailing behind it.  Object appeared to make a right angle turn away from us.  The fire stopped.  We lost sight.  The object was descending at a shallow angle when it turned. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM A SECOND WITNESS, LOCATED NEAR VENTURA, CA)) We saw a fireball driving home from Utah last night that matched this very closely at the exact same time - 7PM.  We were on Hwy 126 about 10 miles east of Ventura when I saw a white fireball streak across the sky in front of the car slightly to our left.  That would have put it to the South of us toward Oxnard, likely out over the ocean.     It was traveling left to right, meaning it was heading pretty much due South.  It seemed to turn slightly green and left a long trail behind it.  It was low in the sky, I'd estimate 10 degrees, was obscured by some trees, then reappeared on the other side of them, then we lost sight of it.  I'd estimate we saw it for 5 seconds.   Since in the report below they were looking south I think this was the same object.  I however did not see it make any turn (although we lost sight of it at the end) and assumed it was a very large close meteor.

Orange fireball, emitted a blinking object and flew upwards until it was as small as a star.;2016-02-20 23:45:00;3 minutes;Orange fireball, emitted a blinking object and flew upwards until it was as small as a star. Went outside for a cigarette, looked up and saw what I thought was an orange shooting star, had a fiery tail.   The object dropped off a blinking orange object and then gained altitude until it was as small as a star.;35.2618495504498;-120.655285414584
