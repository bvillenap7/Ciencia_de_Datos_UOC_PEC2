It was a perfectly blue sky, no clouds in sight.  A friend and I were looking in a northwest direction above the horizon, when we noticed a very fast moving object heading north along the coast.  It was too far away to describe a shape, but appeared to leave a white tail.  As it was gaining in altitude, after traveling 5 or 10 miles, it suddenly made a 90 degree turn (I mean, a complete left angle)heading upward in a west direction and quickly disappeared through the atmosphere.  There was no sound.  It was incredibly fast and quiet! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.2618495504498;-120.655285414584
Erratic light movement.;2015-11-10 18:00:00;10 minutes;Erratic light movement. First observation was a red light that moved erratically, first up then down, then back up and sideways very very fast.  The light then changed to green and repeated the sequence of movements.  The horizontal movement covered a distance of two or three miles in 4-5 seconds.;35.2618495504498;-120.655285414584
Took place in under a second, drone-like, traveling potentially 100-300 mph, extremely bright, covered in lights.;2021-01-26 18:35:00;&lt1 second;Took place in under a second, drone-like, traveling potentially 100-300 mph, extremely bright, covered in lights. Event took place in under 1 second.  I was the only witness.  Can't confirm this was a UFO, but not sure what else it could be.  The best explanation I can describe is this: Walking down a street on Cal Poly State University, took a right into a courtyard/grassy area between the Math/Science buildings, and almost immediately I saw what looked like a large drone (although couldn't tell what size or how far away it was), completely covered in bright, LED-like lights traveling at an insane speed (maybe 100-300 mph?), and within split seconds it vanished/faded away.  I had no drugs in my system, had sufficient sleep the night before, and I cannot imagine this was simply a hallucination.  I can't imagine this is simply a drone because what would explain the insane speed, vanishing, and no one else in sight?  It was 6:35 PM and completely dark outside.  The only other thing I could think of was maybe I looked at a streetlight for too long and it took a second for ! my eyes to adjust to the dark again, but I tried experimenting with this after the fact without any success.;35.2618495504498;-120.655285414584
