I watch for a second, then from the left of the window I saw this red light that traveled in a circle a bit then stopped, then started a bit then stopped running in a circle. It was in my view for about five seconds then it left my range of view.;35.2618495504498;-120.655285414584
Round, white, slow moving object seen in San Luis Obispo California;2007-08-27 04:34:00;4-5 seconds;Round, white, slow moving object seen in San Luis Obispo California The sighting happened during the recent eclipse of the moon.  I was watching the red moon, and at 4:34am I saw an object moving from the north-west toward the east. It traveled in an arcing motion across the sky.  The object had no lights, and from the bottom it reflected light from the city.  It was a light grey or white in color.  It looked to be round in shape, though hard to tell from the distance and limited light.  The object created no sound what so ever, and it was very quite at this time of the morning.  The sighting only lasted for about 4 to 5 seconds, until it traveled out of view.  In my best estimation, the craft was 2000-5000 feet above, and was traveling, i would say approximatly 200-300mph. I dont know how large it was but i estimated it would be larger than the largest aircraft made. Did anyone else see this object?;35.2618495504498;-120.655285414584

Very bright beam of blue light cut across the night sky. Origin was a small circular obj. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;15 minutes;A very bright beam of blue light cut across the night sky.  The origin was a small circular object, as if far away, but the beam of blue light was very bright and very thin.  The area of the sky at termination side of the beam glowed an eerie green, like foggy northern lights.  The glowing foggy area of the sky continued to glow for 15 minutes until it gradually faded.  The object in the sky moved far away, the beam stopped, and other smaller faint beams could be seen.   I thought maybe it was a rocket taking off from the nearby Vandenberg AFB, but I checked their schedule and no launch.   (They launch Atlas rockets a few times a year).  I've seen many such launches and this was very different.  And this was silent.  No noise.  Just a bright sharp beam of light that sliced the sky and made a large area of the sky glow green, even after the beam left.  Two of us saw it.  We tried to photograph but the contrast did not show up on an iPhone.  Very strange.  We drov! e a miles and still saw it, indicating it was far. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.
