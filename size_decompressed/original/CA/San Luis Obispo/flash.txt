My mother and I were taking our usual evening walk and saw a large whitish/yellowish flash of light high up in the night sky and then 2 more flashes a little smaller in size followed one after another less than a second in time apart to the right. Duration of flash was short but had a sort of fading effect.;35.2618495504498;-120.655285414584
