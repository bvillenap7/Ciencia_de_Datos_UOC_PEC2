Fast moving glowing white light changed direction suddenly and zig-zagged out of sight.;2001-11-28 17:30:00;12-15 seconds;Fast moving glowing white light changed direction suddenly and zig-zagged out of sight. Facing east from balcony of office building a white dim light descended in an eastward direction overhead and suddenly changed direction at roughly a 90-degree angle to the right (north).  Then changed direction again and zinged around erratically and faded from view towards the east among heavy clouds.  Object glowed and moved very fast.  Initially was mistaken for meteorite.;37.4695561264821;-122.24544229249
8:14 a,m, My family apparently saw a scene of two bright white objects destroyed by a green object.;2005-10-27 08:14:00;5 min;8:14 a,m,  My family apparently saw a scene of two bright white objects destroyed by a green object. It was at 8:14 a.m. on October 27, 2005, that I and my family saw two unidentified flying objects.  We were on highway 280 driving on our way to Redwood city from San Francisco when we saw these objects.  It was my wife who pointed these two mysterious objects out as I was driving.  She tapped me on the shoulder an told me to looked up to the upper right corner of the sky.  I saw two bright stationary objects (they appeared to be brighter than the sun or anything I have ever seen in my entire life. There was a large object above a smaller one.  I did not look at them the entire time because I was on the high-way and I did not want to risk an accident with another car, so I turned away and started driving.  When there were not any cars around and it was safe to slow down, I looked back up into the same spot of the sky I had just looked at and saw five white lights in the sky.  They were as bright as the other objects I had seen except this time they were smaller.  As I watched them they appeared to be falling towards the earth (I do not know how high up the objects were). I asked my wife and children what had happened and they told me that the object had exploded in the sky after a light green object emItted some kind of a beam.   According to my wife and children, the two bright white objects had been obviously been attacked and destroyed by the green object.  I would have taken a picture but my camera phone does not take pictures of far away objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

2 highly maneuverable, fast, satellite-resembling objects.;2006-11-11 19:00:00;15 seconds;2 highly maneuverable, fast, satellite-resembling objects. 2nd visual within a year of this activity.  2 lights moving fast across sky from south to northwest.  Appear to travel at same speed as (and resemble) satellites.  These were two lights in close formation.  Initial thought was that they were military fighters.  However the initial speed across the sky was too fast for that altitude (high altitude guessed due to no noise).  Pair remained in perfect formation until they both moved erraticly first away from and then into each other.  The speeds and accelerations were incredible.  Both objects then disappeared out of sight.;37.4695561264821;-122.24544229249
Red Light in the sky 09/15/2012-09/16/2012;2012-09-15 23:30:00;30 minutes;Red Light in the sky 09/15/2012-09/16/2012 viewing from redwood city towards the ocean side of mountains saw red/amber light undulating upward then steady slowly moved towards the north direction. then disappeared after 3-5 mins of appearance.  Light does not appear to be switching on/off (like normal aircraft) but at distance it looked like it is twinkling, no trail of smoke or particle likes;37.4695561264821;-122.24544229249
Red/blue orb flying sporadically above Redwood City.;2015-03-18 23:40:00;5-10 minutes;Red/blue orb flying sporadically above Redwood City. I arrived home late from dinner Wednesday night at 11:30pm.  As I took the garbage cans outside, I just happened to look up at the clear sky.  To the northwest, close to above the 280 freeway, I saw a blue bright orb.  As I saw it, it steadily moved in the opposite flow of airplanes circling around to land at SFO.   It then appeared to move vertically down, hover, then vertically back up.  The blue light then turned bright red.  It was bright enough to create a halo or orb around the object.   The now red light ascended and moved horizontally across the sky.  Definitely not an airplane or heli.  I also thought drone, but way to big and fast unless it was a huge commercial drone.  Drones don't also make them self visible as bright blue/red lights.  The red light moved all directions in the sky very rapidly.   After about 5 minutes of tracking it across the sky.  It seemed to go straight down again and eventually went behind the Canada College parking lot bright lights we can see from our place.   I'm excited in what I saw and took some video.  Never seen anything like this before.  I always look up at night and finally caught something I couldn't identity.  I only hope others saw it as well.;37.4695561264821;-122.24544229249
