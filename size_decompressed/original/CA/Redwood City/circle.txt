A flashing ,stretching light in the south west sky in redwood city;2005-09-04 21:00:00;15 minutes;A flashing ,stretching light in the south west sky in redwood city I live in Redwood city ca. I often go out at night and sit on the hammock in my backyard and look up at the sky.  I see lots of planes and shooting starz. but on three seperate occasions over a one month period. I saw somthing I cannot explain.  The first one was like a flash of light out of the corner of my eye to the south west muontains like someone took a picture in the sky. like a bright strobe light flash. I looked in the direction of the flash and did not see any thing again so I did not think too much about it.  The following week in the same general area I saw a bright flash again. This time I staired in the loction for about 45sec and it flashed agian. I watched this for about 15min. about every 45sec to aminute or more it would flash this vary bright strobe. it was in the same location each time I lined up the flash area with the corner roof of my house and this object was in the same spot each time. The flashes were inconsistant and vary far apart not like an airplain flashes its light when flying over. I went in and told my wife to come and take a look at this. when she came out I told her to look in the area I was seeing this light at and about 1min later it flashed again.  THEN IT GOT BETTER!  The next time it flashed it was like the light stretched like someone took a rubber band and stretched it and then let go of one end. It was like it move so fast then stoped and the tail of the light cought up to it. This happened in in the blink of an eye. It did this one more time a few seconds later  leaving a green, blue and yellowish haze in the sky. after that i never saw anything agian. afew days later I saw and wathed the same flash in the sky a little more to the south the the fist two lights. Agian it would flash in an incosistant time interval. This time the last flash was very bright had the shape of a cresant moon. Then nothing. Has anyone els in the SF Bay area seen anything like this?;37.4695561264821;-122.24544229249
Bright light moving at a high rate of speed from south to north.;2006-07-13 02:20:00;5 seconds;Bright light moving at a high rate of speed from south to north. I was driving in a westerly direction on Broadway near 5th avenue in Redwood City, CA at 0220hrs when I noticed a light in the sky through my front windshield. The sky was overcast and the moon, which seemed nearly full, was barely visible as a round circle and a glow through the clouds to the rear of my vehicle. The object was moving at a very high rate of speed from south to north. The object was visible as a bright light that was behind or in the clouds. I've seen meteors/shooting stars before, but I don't think they would have been this visible through the cloud cover. The object itself was only visible as a glowing white light in the sky, due to the clouds I could see no shape except for the light itself which was circular in shape. There was a glow of light around the object that was nearly three to four times the size of the actual light itself, but I suspect that this was due to the clouds. The object did not change course or move from a straight line and I quickly lost sight of it as it went behind some trees that line the street. I only saw the object through the front windshield of my vehicle as I was driving, it started out near the middle of the left side of my windshield and moved to the upper right side of my windshield over the 5 seconds or so that I saw it. It was not any sort of reflection of a streetlight or anything like that on my windshield, it was clearly an object in or behind the clouds. I did not notice any change in brightness that would indicate if it was moving toward me or away from me. I quicly drove to a more open area near an industrial park next to Highway 101, which took me only about 15 seconds, but I was unable to regain a visual on the object.  The object was not on any regular flight path that I'm aware of. Many flights into SFO fly past Redwood City, but they are closer to the bay and don't move nearly as fast or in the same diretion that this object did. I am hoping that maybe someone further north in San Mateo County or perhaps in the east bay (Oakland, Hayward, etc.) got a better view of this object since when I drove north there was hardly any cloud cover at all.;37.4695561264821;-122.24544229249
