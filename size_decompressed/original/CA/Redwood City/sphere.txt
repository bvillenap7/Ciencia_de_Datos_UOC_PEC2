two spheres seen hanging motionless in sky, a short, thin vapor trail, (or not) projected out of it.;2006-05-13 20:30:00;5-10 minutes;two spheres seen hanging motionless in sky, a short, thin vapor trail, (or not) projected out of it. While driving on Highway 280 North Bound, Looking west after sunset, driver and passanger saw two spherical objects way up high in the sky. Also present was a short, thin vapor trail (or not a vapor trail) projecting out of, or beaming from one of these objects. These objects did not appear to move or change in any way throughout the duration of the sighting. The sighting lasted five to ten minutes. These witnesses are no nonsense, down to earth people. They are also very sceptical, so much that I had to believe what they were telling me was true, because there's no way they'd admit seeing anything unexplained if it were'nt absolutely true.

Redwood City Sphere, third sighting;2011-05-03 21:00:00;3-5 mins;Redwood City Sphere, third sighting This is now the third time I have seen tis type of sphere. It moved north to south and at one point it sort of moved west but back to its original path in a 'dizzy' motion. It seems as if it was 20, 000 feet high or higher.  The object would change speeds and was going twice as fast as an aircraft. After about 4 minutes the sphere began to lose its light as if shutting off and no object could be seen afterwards.
