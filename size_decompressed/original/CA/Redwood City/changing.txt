8/26/2006 2200 HOURS THREE UFOS OVER SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS.;2006-08-26 22:00:00;30 minutes;8/26/2006 2200 HOURS THREE UFOS OVER SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS. 2200.IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT, I WAS WATCHING THE PLANES FLY THREW THE SKY FROM MY BALCONY. I NOTICED THAT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A PLANE WAS HOOVERING OVER THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS.IT APPEARED TO BE SQUARE THEN THE LIGHTS STARTED. BLINKING WHITE ,RED, WHITE, RED. THE TWO RED ON TOP AND THE TWO WHITE ON THE BOTTOM, LIKE A SQUARE. AT THAT POINT I CALLED MY BROTHER WHO SAW THE SAME THING.WE THEN SAW THE CRAFT START FLASHING RAPID COLORS,RED,GREEN, BLUE,ORANGE,YELLOW.THIS WAS VERY STRANGE BECAUSE A.) YOU COULD SEE IT WITH THE NAKED EYE AND THE LIGHTS STARTED TAKING SHAPES. OBLONG,ROUND,SQUIGGLEY. MY BROTHER WAS LOOKING THROUGH THR BINOCULAR'S AND SEND OH MY GOD THERE ARE TWO MORE ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM. THEY WERE MUCH SMALLER BUT ALSO USING COLORS.THEN I SAW A LARGE BEACON OF LIGHT THAT LOOKED TO BE COMMING FROM MOFFAT AIR FORCE BASE. THE UFOS STARTED FLASHING FASTER AND FASTER.THE TWO SMALLER ONES FLEW ABOVE THE LARGE ONE MAKING A PERFECT TRIANGLE.THERE WAS MORE COLORED LIGHTS FLASHING FROM ALL THREE.THEN THE TWO SMALL ONES JUST DISSAPPEARED. THE LARGE ONE STOPPED ALL THE COLOR FLASHES.THEN THERE WERE TWO BRIGHT FLASHES  AND THE CRAFT WAS GONE. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS ALSO WAS THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE PLANE IN SIGHT THE WHOLE THIRTY MINUTES. THIS FLIGHT PATH IS ONE OF THE BUSIEST FOR SFO AIRPORT. THERE ARE USUALLY THREE TO FOUR PLANES IN THE AIR AT ONE TIME FOR AT LEAST THREE HOURS. PLANES WERE ALL OVER THE SKY. THESE THINGS SHOW UP AND KNOW PLANES ANYWHERE.;37.4695561264821;-122.24544229249
3 witnesses of a red/orange glowing orb darting above soccer field while changing size and color.;2016-12-21 21:00:00;30 seconds;3 witnesses of a red/orange glowing orb darting above soccer field, while changing size and color. Pre-arranged siting with Beings of a red/orange glowing orb above the soccer field at local park.  Was able to get a shaky video while walking toward orb.  The orb darted around starting out small and continued to change shape, size an color.  Varying from a basketball size glowing red/orange orb to a small pea size white dot.  It disappeared almost as quickly as it appeared. I have been fortunate and seen numerous UFO's and have been visited many times.  There were 2 other witnesses who were chasing the orb also.  It was their first sighting and they were stunned as they discussed what is wasn't.;37.4695561264821;-122.24544229249
