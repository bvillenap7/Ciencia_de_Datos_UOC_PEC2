I INSISTED I WAS SEEING SOMETHING BEYOND EXISTENCE.................;2007-03-03 21:00:00;15min;I INSISTED I WAS SEEING SOMETHING BEYOND EXISTENCE................. It was late at night when my brother called me over to come outside and hurry.He started to point at the sky and as i looked up i saw around ten bright,triangular,almost star-like objects.He told me that they had become a straight line and that a while after they began to form a circle.My brother then, ran inside the house to get his video camera and at that time i was on the phone with a friend of mine and i started to tell her everything that i was seeing.She began to tell me that i was crazy and if i was joking.I insisted that i was not lieing and so i hanged up and a few seconds after my brother came running with his video camera.He started recording the objects when i noticed them going toward the coastline. I was guessing they were going about 30mph and they were about 30,000 miles above ground.I felt VERY scared and shocked to be seeing something so unusual.

6 yellow lights in two triangle formations;2013-04-06 22:00:00;20 minutes;6 yellow lights in two triangle formations I was walking my dog and looked up in the sky and saw 6 yellow lights in a triangle formation.  This formation lasted about 5 min or so. I thought it was military helicopters but then five lights disappeared and one stayed in the air for a while.  I don't believe in ufo but this was kind of strange, my own family doesn't believe me;37.4695561264821;-122.24544229249
