My mother and I were riding in her car, about 1:30pm, clear day, and all of the sudden the sky went dark, just for a second.  It was enough to get our attention, we looked at each other in disbelief.  I opened her sunroof right away and there was nothing in the sky, no noise of a plane.  We thought it was really strange and I have talked to a couple of other people who say.now that you mention it, I noticed the same thing.  It was something that I wouldn't have paid much attention to if I had been ny myself.  The fact that we both witnessed this total eclipse just made me want to find out more information or if others had the same experience.  I also know that early that morning there was an old fighter plane flying in the same area.;37.4695561264821;-122.24544229249
Followed three pairs of white lights for ~15 seconds moving across the sky in formation, at a stellar distance.;2011-10-28 00:46:00;~12 to 15 seconds;Followed three pairs of white lights for ~15 seconds moving across the sky in formation, at a stellar distance. I felt a spontaneous need to go outside and purvey the night sky (this was at about 12:43-ish a.m.) right after brushing my teeth to go to sleep for the night. I walked out onto my roof, and within about two or so minutes or browsing over the constellations and various objects in the sky, something suddenly caught my eye. Three dimly visible pairs of white lights. About as dim as your average star in the sky - nothing especially bright, but not so, so dim that you really have to focus to see it. I was looking almost directly upward, and then somewhat towards the west. What I saw were three craft. Each consisted of two dim white lights at either end of what would be considered their wingspan. The eastern-most and middle craft were spaced about 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch (in terms of holding up a ruler against the sky) apart, with the western-most about 1/2 to 5/8 of an inch from the middle one. In terms of my viewpoint, they were arranged like so: top--middle----bottom - top being east, bottom being west. They flew basically northeast to southwest, possibly over the ley line labeled 8 to 16 in this picture: http://www.crystalinks.com/becker-hagensmap4.jpg   They flew at perfectly equal speeds to each other.  They were at an what I would assume was an incredible distance, as like I said, they were as dim as your average star in the night sky.  They traveled at what I would also assume was an incredibly high speed, given the distance I was viewing from. I stared for about 12-15 seconds, then turned around to look across to another apartment complex where two men were sitting on their balcony, curious if they were aware of the same thing (they weren't), and when I turned back about three seconds later, I was unable to re-spot the objects. These were absolutely not any type of stars or satellites, as there were three of them, all moving together across the sky at perfectly equal speed. They weren't human-built airplanes of any sort, as no human craft is even nearly capable of such absurdly high rates of travel. A military plane (what appeared to be a fighter jet, devoid of any flashing or bright lights [which you never see around here]) flew over at give or take three to five thousand feet in the opposite direction of the three UFOs about three to five minutes after I lost sight of them, so obviously someone at some level of authority saw the same thing I saw. I can't help but believe this is somehow connected to 10/28/11 being the end of the Mayan Tun calendar. My mind is blown. That's all I can really say.;37.4695561264821;-122.24544229249
