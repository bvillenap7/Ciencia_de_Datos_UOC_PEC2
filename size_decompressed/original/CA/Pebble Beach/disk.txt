It appeared to be two short, whitish blue blinking lights trailing behind a longer, turquoise blue light. The flight patterns were erratic and varying, not flying like any regular aircraft. The craft frequently dove and dipped in the sky, often seeming to flip over or rotate. The craft flew very quickly, faster than any regular aircraft. The craft often crossed the sky within eight seconds or less. When the craft appeared to be in the center of the sky, a slight whirring noise could be heard. About ten minutes into the encounter, the lights appeared to split and fly separately. The lights separated into smaller lights, a string of six to seven. After flying separately for at least thirty seconds, the lights recondensed back into one long light.;36.5918;-121.9431
