orange glowing orb-like lights seen by myself and other prisoners at Calipatria State Prison.;1995-06-15 19:00:00;10-20 minutes;orange glowing orb-like lights seen by myself and other prisoners at Calipatria State Prison. Years ago,  while serving time at Calipatria State Prison. While we were returning from the chow hall after the evening meal was served we noticed bright orange glowing lights off to our left (towards the east near the arizona -california border) they seemed to just hover there.  My first thought was that they were helicopters but to my knowledge choppers can't stay on station that long and to just hover there seemingly motionless.  Even helicopters on station will move laterally to some degree these did not we heard no noises either. Due to the proximity to the Yuma weapons testing ground and other military installations in that area we assumed it was some type of new flares or something along those lines. but To my understanding flares don't stay up in the sky that long. I'm not sure exactly about the exact month of this sighting.  Also if they were helicopters they would have been to close together in formation to just hover it would seem that their rotor blades would have colided with one another.  It was strange indeed and there were alot of us prisoners that saw this incident. We were not allowed to stay out side and watch them as long as we wanted to as we were being herded back into our buildings/cells but we witnessed them for at least 10 minutes or so and heard reports from other inmates as they returned back to the building so they had to have been out there for some time. Also it should be noted that this occured for several nights consecutively at approximately the same time. ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary date so that the report sorts to June 1995.
