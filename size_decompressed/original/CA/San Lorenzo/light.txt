Lights moving from west to east.;2003-05-21 22:00:00;1.5 Hours;Lights moving from west to east. I was standing outside with some neighbors and saw lights going across the sky, at very high altitudes, moving from west to east.  Upon further inspection with binoculars, they just seemed to be lights, but obviously not airplanes.  Towards the end of what I saw, there was a large, seemingly closer bright one, but it too just seemed to be a light.  Shortly after this, I went back into the house to go to bed.;37.6787;-122.127
transforming light with shooting fireball;2007-06-14 02:00:00;2 hours;transforming light with shooting fireball While looking due west at the evening stars,I noticed a large,extremly bright light fluttering. At first I thought it was Venus, but it was much too bright and almost looked diamond shaped. Below it I noticed a smaller twinkling orange star which  kept hoovering from side to side. Then suddenly  it bolted up toward the west. It continued to do this until it stopped abruptly and began to shoot down while completly orange like a fireball. The largerlight  light seemed to be moving almost as if circling. It seemed to be revolving.  Changing from big and bright to getting a little smaller, but still bright, then finally shining  brighter and having sharp points like a triangle.  It continued to do this for about an hour. The entire occurrence lasted about 2 1/2 hours moving slowly northwest until it finally disappeared completly from sight .  It was the most phenomenal thing I've ever seen!;37.6787;-122.127
