Triangular, silent object, descends through clouds then ascends upwards, followed by helicopter.;1994-12-24 21:00:00;3-5 minutes;Triangular, silent object, descends through clouds then ascends upwards, followed by helicopter. We were outside at a Christmas Eve dinner on a cloud covered night. Estimated ceiling approximately 1500 feet AGL. A triangular object was observed descending vertically through the clouds, pointing south, absolutely silent. It turned 90 degrees to the west, and while moving slowly west, ascended through the clouds and was not seen again. Within a minute a police helicopter moving from east to west just below cloud layer turned it's daylighter spotlight on at the approximate place where the UFO was sighted, shining it's light horizontally beneath the clouds as opposed to shining it in the typical downward angle.

Silent aircraft flying in formation at night without nav lights.  ((anonymous report));2017-04-18 01:00:00;30 seconds;Silent aircraft flying in formation at night without nav lights. Co-worker glanced upward and was staring into the sky.  Asked myself and another co-worker what are those up there?. Myself and second co worker look straight upward and see slow flying formation of dark  triangular silhouette of high altitude aircraft against the backdrop of clouds and open sky.   The aircraft were very fluid in their flight and were without any lights as well as being perfectly silent.   At seeing the first craft before noticing the others, my initial thought was that it was a large gas filled balloon, or perhaps a trash bag caught in the jetstream, but upon noticing others, I was able to make out a very noticeable triangular delta shape to each craft silhouette in contrast to the sky.   These were definitely not birds or any natural animal but some sort of craft flying silently and without any navigational lighting or other illumination.  My guess is military stealth possible electric propulsion. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Dark black silent triangle flying low;2020-01-03 21:45:00;15 seconds;Dark black silent triangle flying low I was taking out the trash at 9:45pm and I stopped to look up at the moon. Then I saw a dark black triangle with slightly lighter colored circles on the points (but the whole craft was very dark - no lights or anything). I almost didn't see it. It was about 200 feet up and completely silent, flying in a straight line right over me. It lasted about 15 seconds before it flew out of sight. I got the feeling it could see me, like it was surveillance.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
