FIRE Balls moving around inside my bedroom;2008-04-17 02:00:00;4 seconds;FIRE Balls moving around inside my bedroom On the night of April 16th, I went to sleep..  I cannot remember the time that night that this incident happened but if I had to guess i would have been around 2 am of april 17th... I woke up to my boyfriend screaming: What the F--- are these lights?  And he got up out of bed immediately, he almost jumped out of bed literally.  He became very pale and disoriented.  I opened my eyes, and I saw an amazing event happen right before my eyes..  From what I can remember there were about two solid fire ball lights  in a perfect circle the size of about 3 tennis balls.  and they were moving around in such a synchonized pattern, almost a pattern of something that existed all on its own.  It had sort of a magnetic movement...  The balls were moving very fast in a circular sideway motion and they would leave a trace of light behind, which made an amazing design in front of us..  It only lasted for about 4 to 5 seconds and then it completely dissapeared.  The lights were not on the wall or on the ceiling, they were floating in the middle of the room.  Now, there are no open windows in the room, they are all covered with blinds and dark curtains.   So there is absolutely no possible way that they were being reflected from outside.  I also heard a few knocks in the door, but my boyfriend says he did not hear the knocks.  After this happened, he ran outside and saw nothing.  My heart rate went up for about a whole hour after this incident and he could not go to sleep.  He described this adrenaline rush the whole night.   Then my cell phone messages were all messed up.  The saved ones: it kept on saying that they were no longer there. But then later it came back. This is the first time i actually saw something like this in my life, and I think is absolutely fascinating.  I wish it would come back so that I can really figure out what it is. Maybe it will.   I know 2 other people who actually saw the same thing that night , strangers, and the reason I know they werent lying is that they actually were the ones to tell me the date and describe it into details...  If anyone experienced this, please,  I am very interestedin science and the paranormal.  Whatever it may have been, it will bother me for the rest of my life if I dont see it again, because I need to understand things... Also if you know what it could possibly be, please let me know.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
Silent, red lights flying in formation in the night sky.;2014-09-27 22:25:00;20 seconds;silent, red lights flying in formation in the night sky. After hearing all the reports I finally saw it for myself, the much talked about group of red orbs flying across the night sky. At approximately 10:25 pm PST on Saturday, September 27, 2014, I was looking south out the window of my apartment, located in Sherman Oaks, CA, as I usually do listening to late night radio.  My window faces the Hollywood Hills.  I am on the second floor and I can look over the rooftops of the building next to me with an unobstructed view of the night sky. Looking out at the night lights and aerial comings and goings I noticed three red lights pop on in the night sky.  They didn’t enter in from one side of the window but rather popped on as if they either just showed up in that location or decided to turn on their lights.  If one was to try to pinpoint the location I would say the lights came on over the San Fernando Valley between Laurel Canyon and Van Nuys Blvd. The lights moved from east to west. The lights were a milky red color glowing color.  Red balls of light as I’ve heard many see through out the United States.  They stayed in a V formation and kept pace with each other with none of them pulling away from or falling behind the others and they all kept the same altitude.  They moved at a brisk pace and there was no sound as one would hear with a helicopter or plane. This lasted for about twenty seconds before it dawned on me what I was seeing.  I moved to a westerly facing window but the tree blocked my view and I did not see them again. Having spent hours looking out this window for many years I know that these were not helicopters as the lights were not those of the numerous helicopters that I have seen at night, nor were they the lights of a low flying place as I could see sky between the red lights. My best guess is that they were about half a mile away from my location and flying maybe 200 to 300 feet off the ground. I have worked in the film industry for over 20 years, mainly in the field of visual effects, and I know of no technological set up that would let one pull this off over a densely populated area and just below the flight paths of Bob Hope and Van Nuys airport.  And to that point, having heard and seen everything from Lear jets to military and commercial aircraft to news and police helicopters I can without a doubt say that what I saw was nothing like anything I’ve seen in the sky.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
Like a plane on fire with a long tail of read flames, white flames inside the red tail.((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD));2016-07-27 22:41:00;20 seconds;Like a plane on fire with a long tail of read flames, white flames inside the red tail,  like a candle burns Like a large plane on fire the object went across the night sky, West to East.  It covered  90 degrees of my sight line.  It traveled about the same speed as an airplane one normally watches at night.   It went directly over the San Fernando Valley, heading due East towards Arizona.   The object was the length of the full moon, the height maybe half or  quarter the full moon. About the size of a plane in the sky if it were ablaze  The  tail,  orange and red, like a candle flame burns,  but on its side.   The tail was 10-20 full moons long.  A spectacular sight. I took a photo,  which kinda looks like it, ith a 135mm nikkor f22 on bulb, so it is not a great shot, although my wife looked at it and said cool. ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.

Red light over Sherman Oaks, CA.;2017-07-27 23:54:00;2 minutes;Red light over Sherman Oaks, CA I was sitting in my backyard, when I noticed a bright dark red ball above my neighbor's house.  It was stationary for a few seconds and started to move left, so I stood up and grabbed my phone so I could record it.  While I was recording it, I asked it to come back.   At that point it stopped and then started returning to the right back towards me.  I was a little freaked out that it heard me and I said to it that you are following me and then the light went out. I have blown up a few stills from the video and appears to be round built out of perfect squares with light from within.  As well appears to have some sort of vapor coming from both top and bottom of craft.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042

I witnessed a orange ball shoot down from the sky before stopping in mid air.  The object proceeded to dash from side to side.  The entire time the object was disappearing then reappearing.
