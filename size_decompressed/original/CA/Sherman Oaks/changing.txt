I thought it was a balloon for a split second, and waited for it to blow away but it didnâ€™t.  It was about the size of  basketball, if was clear with metal machinery inside.  It floated five feet above the apartment for 29 seconds before floating up back to space as a star in the sky.  It also changed shape after few hundred feet into the air as a white orb.
