Nightime,black craft/no lights, flying under conventional aircraft,craft had a thick body with short stuby shark fin like wings!;1999-11-19 21:07:00;3 to 4 seconds;Nightime,black craft/no lights, flying under conventional aircraft,craft had a thick body with short stuby shark fin like wings! I was sitting in my backyard and looked up to veiw the passing of what sounded like a jet in the night sky. I made eye contact with the object (flying in a northwesterly direction) which had displayed a flashing beacon and looked very typical of the kind of aircraft one might veiw in the night sky. Then my eye was drawn to an other object which was flying below, also in a northwesterly direction(this craft was heading more north than west)however,this object was flying at a great rate of speed and traveling at a much lower altitude. The object looked completely black and traveling without lights. It seemed to be traveling without sound as well,however,there was noise from the conventional aircraft flying at a much higher altitude above,so maybe the one craft masked the sound of the other. The black craft had a very long thick body with two very odd looking short stuby, shark fin like wings attached, however I was viewing the object from the side and it was at a slight angle,so the object could have been triangular.The craft appeared to be ascending!The cloud cover is quite thick tonight (a marine layer) and the black craft almost blended in with the cloud cover. As it passed over I could see patches of cloud mist against the craft's black body. I would have never noticed it had it not been for the sighting of the first aircraft flying overhead.The black craft looked very out of place and it gave me the distinct impression that it was trying to remain hidden.It looked very ominous and strange.The black craft was about the size of a thumb veiwed in the horizontal position at arms length.I would guess that the object was at about 6000 to 7000 feet,but that's just a guess(the conventional aircraft was much higher.) My veiw of it was only for a few seconds,then it vanished.I have been watching the night and day sky for years and I  have never seen anything like this!It was very weird!!! ((NUFORC Note:  The following information was submitted 22NO99 to supplement the first report.)) (clarification) of sighting and reporting of black craft on 11/19/99 The altitude of the craft was hard to estimate.Craft was probably smaller than thumb at arms length! The Black craft was very visible against the cloud cover! There are two airports nearby. Sherman Oaks is a few miles southeast of Van Nuys Airport and about 6 miles west of Burbank Airport. No lights could be seen on any portion of the craft!;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
A single small cloud moved from WNW to WSW over a 5 min. period in an otherwise clear sky. Faintly comet-shaped. Military rocket launch;1999-12-10 16:45:00;5 min?;A single small cloud moved from WNW to WSW over a 5 min. period in an otherwise clear sky. Faintly comet-shaped. Military rocket launch? I am a computer-graphics animator with interest in weather, astronomy, space travel, etc. I watch the sky a lot, and what I saw wouldn't have raised the average person's eyebrow but I found it hard to explain. I was driving westbound on the 101 freeway at about 4:45pm on Friday, December 10. There was a very strong wind (around 30 mph) blowing out of the north. The sun had set earlier but the western sky was still bright with upward-slanting sunlight. The sky was completely cloudless (except for 2-3 cumulus clouds very far to the north end of the San Fernando Valley which were no longer lit by direct sunlight). There were a number of contrails from overflying jets (there are many major airways over the SF Valley). These all appeared as salmon and orange-colored lines of about two inches at arm's length. They didn't persist but followed close behind the jets. As I drove West through Sherman Oaks, I saw a small cloud to the WNW, a little to the right of the freeway and just above treetop level. It appeared a bit smaller than my thumbnail at arm's length. The cloud appeared to be illuminated by sunlight, but it was very fuzzy and not as dense or as detailed as a cumulus cloud. Still, it had visible volume and the side facing the sun (now hidden by the horizon) was brighter than the other side. It was not a bright orange or yellow as the nearby contrails but rather had a slight pinkish quality. It rather looked like a vaporous ball that had been smudged horizontally. I judged it to be fairly high and far away, based on the fact that it was still receiving sunlight even though all the mountains in the valley were in total shadow. It struck me as odd, being the only visible cloud in the sky, and not dispersing from winds. As I watched over a period of 5 minutes it drifted to the left of the freeway, still around treetop level and still being hit by sunlight. When I looked at the cloud with my peripheral vision it appeared to take on a cometary appearance, being pointed on the leading edge and fanning out on the trailing side. This detail wasn't as obvious with my direct vision. As time passed the cloud did seem to shrink slightly, perhaps to 3/4ths its original size. Eventually it disappeared from view, but given its path it wasn't going to pass behind any visual obstructions. I got the impression it simply stopped existing. My guess is: this was an exhaust plume from a military space launch from some facility to the north or northwest of the LA region. We've had a number beautiful upper-atmosphere tests here in recent years and I rather expected this to be another of those launches, but I didn't observe anything more than the one cloud. The quality of the cloud's density and shape was similar to the clips I've seen of rocket exhausts in the upper atmosphere/low orbit realm where there isn't any turbulence to speak of. If it was a rocket, then it must have been travelling westward from the launch point. That's unusual (but not unheard of) because most rockets lauch to the east to take advantage of the earth's rotational speed. If it wasn't a rocket, then I'm at a loss to explain it. Are there any records of a launch on that day?;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
My wife and I saw an '8' shaped white light in the sky move very quickly (vertically)across a great distance, then disappear.;2000-09-19 09:30:00;15 sec;My wife and I saw an '8' shaped white light in the sky move very quickly (vertically)across a great distance, then disappear. My wife and I were on our way own when my wife noticed something in the sky. She asked me is that a plane? I was driving so I couldn't look right away, but after a few seconds I looked up and saw an '8' shaped white light in the sky several miles ahead of us. It moved vertically, while swerving from side to side. The light went off once, then after a second or so, it came back on, quite far away from where it was when the light went off. Then after another second or so, it went off again and disappeared. It's a pretty clear night so I don't know where it could have gone. The strangest thing about it was the movement and the speed at which it seemed to have traveled. I would have dismissed it as a helicopter if it weren't for these two factors. My wife is convinced it's a UFO, but I'm wondering if there is another explanation. I'd appreciate an e-mail with any information regarding this 'sighting'. My wife and I have never seen anything like this before. This is my first time filing a report of this kind.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
flying wing type object in the los angeles area.  4:30am 8-16-04;2004-08-16 04:00:00;10 seconds;flying wing type object in the los angeles area.  4:30am 8-16-04 i went outside at about 4:25 - 4:30am and observed an object moving from south to north at a very high rate of speed.  i initially saw the object in the southern sky and it moved across my field of vision to the northern sky in approx 10 seconds.  the object was somewhat flying wing shaped, almost rectangular....the color was white/grayish and the object had no visible lights  and emitted no sound at all.  the object was approx 1/4 - 1/2 the size of a full moon.  i'm a very skeptical person by nature, and i am involved in aviation.  i can identify most civilian and military aircraft as i fly for a living.  i'm not koo-koo, i saw something that i can't explain.  the object certainly didn't look like any type of aircraft i am aware of.  this event took place a little bit east of the 405 fwy and 101 fwy interchange.   the object appeared to be at an altitude of around 2000 feet.  that's a guess on my part. there was no adverse electrical activity or anything like that.  nothing happened to any of my appliances TV etc....just buisness as usual.  my dog didn't have any adverse reaction or barking either (she was oblivious to what i was looking at) i felt pretty much confused after i saw the object....i wasn't scared at all, just baffled.  weirdest thing i have ever seen.  i do have to admit that i am constantly looking upwards.  always had a fascination with astronomy etc... but have never seen anything that would qualify as a UFO -- until now.   i was the only one that saw the object that i am aware of.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
ufc - scrolling lights hovering over los angeles area;2010-08-28 21:20:00;4 minutes;ufc - scrolling lights hovering over los angeles area No Footage!!!  Me and my girlfriend were driving down Riverside Dr. in sherman oaks, Ca @ 9:20pm and she pointed out these lights in the sky over the hill, south of us, which would have been over los angeles. the lights were spinning fast, and the angle that they were at was like a slanted angle. at first the lights looked like it was going away, then it started getting closer and did a crazy turn to the west. the lights were spinning very fast. and it looked as if there was several rows of lights. like a scrolling marquee. There was a red light flashing with the object that i saw when i stopped the car in the middle of the street to look. it kinda looked like a helicopters red light flashing, like a beacon, i am not sure. usually i see that light on regular flying aircrafts. but this thing had lights, rows of lights, at this wierd slanted angle and the lights were rolling. The object, like i said, at first was going away from us, heading south, then it came back over the hill and it looked like it started following the 101 freeway westward. I went home to get my camera and tried to find it but it was gone. i couldnt see it anywhere. i drove all the way to santa monica beach to se if i can catch it again. there had to have been people that saw these lights. it was a crazy, round object with lights all around it, rotating lights. i swear i wouldve thought it was a movie being filmed for a space ship.
