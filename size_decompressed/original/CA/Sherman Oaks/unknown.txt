Came from the west flying east in a steady silent way, running parallel to Ventura blvd.  It had 4-8 red lights sporadically flashing in a vertical pattern, i couldn't tell if they were on the bottom or the side.  It was SILENT.  i tried to keep up with it on Moorpark but it was too fast and continued until it disappeared from my view.  It was VERY strange and exciting.  I couldn't really make out the shape of it other than it was so dark it blended in with the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Lights in the Sky Form Triangle then Diamond then One by One Disappear over Los Angeles;2019-06-14 21:25:00;3-5 minutes;Lights in the Sky Form Triangle then Diamond then One by One Disappear over Los Angeles In the South by Southeastern sky, I saw between the moon and the brightest star what appeared to be another equally bright star, but then to the left and below it appeared two more lights equally as bright firming an equilateral triangle.  Then another above all of these appeared forming a perfect diamond shape and the sum of these continued on another minute or so before they all shut off quickly but one by one and were gone.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
Bright Silent Light in the Sky Following Major Chord Played Across Entire Valley;2021-01-26 03:19:00;15-20 Minutes;Bright Silent Light in the Sky Following Major Chord Played Across Entire Valley At approximately 0315 of 27JAN2021 I was returning to my dwelling and was stopped from the source: perhaps A/C Units or other machinery in some odd sync. s I thought to say “no biggie,” just off to my right began, a somewhat louder and more. This sound played in a higher octave and forced me focus on this chord playing now as whole, in tandem. And No long longer had 5 minutes passed observing this, whan within 30 seconds a bright, thunderless crash lit up the night sky. The high pitch of an intake type of engine, bringing along with them an extra octave to the dual leveled hum that remained until the time I departed. And, i departed at 3:47AM, immediately following some dashlights and AC going crazy.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
