I looked up as a Red Flashing Object caught my eye.  It didn't move for a few minutes.   The object then proceeded to move north towards the Topanga Mountains.   I'll post the vid on you tube on my site called Literati Circle/UFO over the 101 West.  Thx ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
