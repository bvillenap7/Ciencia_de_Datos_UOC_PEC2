Cigar shaped object in Sherman Oaks;1997-09-15 09:00:00;10-15 seconds;Cigar shaped object in Sherman Oaks I am a 47-year-old man with two master degrees in business and technology and I am still puzzled about the origin of this flying object.   This sighting took place on the month of September in 1997.  At about 9am, as I was getting ready to start the day, I approach the window next to the bed and noticed a large cigar shaped object hovering over the area.   I was actually looking to the belly of the object.  At arm's distance, the object was about 6 inches and it had no features such as tail fins that could be seen.  At the beginning I thought that it was some kind of cruise missile that was being tested, but that was impossible.  I noticed that the object did not produce a jet or propeller noise at all.  The object then proceeded to make a 180-degree turn and immediately went back to the direction where it first came from, at the same low speed, until it was no longer visible from my window.  This sighting lasted for about only 10 to 15 seconds.   The whole incident took me by surprise, because I never thought that I would be able to witness thing like it  in that area and in broad day light.
