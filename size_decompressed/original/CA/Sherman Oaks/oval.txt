On the morning of October 28th 2019 at 8:30am I was on my way to work.  My morning commute is about 1 hour and 20 minutes from Van Nuys to Santa Monica. Heading South on the 405 FWY.  There were reports of a fire moving from the Getty Center area onto the Freeway.  The 405 Freeway was shut down.  Traffic was being diverted to the 101 Hollywood Freeway West.  No one could go South on Sepulveda parallel to the 405. So Iâ€™m sitting in my car West on the 101 FWY heading towards the Haskell Ave. exit ramp in Sherman Oaks.  I was just looking around waiting on the traffic to move when I saw 3 oval shaped UFOs hovering in the daytime sky 8:30am.  Blue sky no clouds. 2 of them winked out and reappeared in a different section of the same area.  One stayed stationary. They were about a thousand feet up.  I pulled out my phone and got footage until the traffic started to move on.  I notice by waring UV Sun Shades I was able to see them in a larger size than the naked! eye.  They seemed bigger than they look on my phone cam.  I have footage and stills.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
