Two Diamond Like UFO's seen from Sherman Oaks, CA;2012-04-17 22:50:00;5;Two Diamond Like UFO's seen from Sherman Oaks, CA I walked outside my balcony to have a cigarette. I looked up and noticed an airplane going by and then two really bright stars.  I thought to myself what really bright stars.  Then before I knew it, the two stars starting moving closer and closer to me at such a smooth, high speed velocity. T hen one moved further to the right, while the other kept going to the left and kept coming closer until it stopped.  I grabbed my camera phone and I watched the two aircrafts, they were shaped like diamonds and full of bright light. They just stopped in one place about  what seemed to be 150 kilometers from each other.  Then a black, what looked like a military helicopter came swopping around my building.  It flew around the two UFO's and then it flew far to the right about 300-400 feet from the UFO's.  I then noticed my friend's car pulling up.  As if I knew the UFO's were looking and listening and waiting for me, I told them not to go anywhere. I turned around to leave my bal! cony, but then I quickly turned back and the UFO's both started to leave at the same time.  The one to left flew by so smoothly and at a speed I've never seen before.  The UFO to the right left in the opposite direction at the same speed.  The helicopter waited for another 10-15 mins and it flew around my building before finally leaving the area.

Something Metalic over Sherman Oaks California;2012-06-28 06:45:00;Approx 30 min;Something Metalic over Sherman Oaks California While I was about to get into my car to go to work, I was looking at an airplane flying over head when I noticed the sun reflecting off something bright in the sky (behind the plane and off in the distance).  It was extrememly far away and I was unsure of the distance.  I stood for approx. 5 minutes staring at it wondering what it was and I noticed that it didn't move, but it was twinkling which indicated to me that it was rotating. I ran upstairs to my apartment and got my camera and my husband so he can see it too.  I put my 75/300 mm lens on my camera and started taking pictures of this thing.  I took pictures for about 15 minutes, then realized I was going to be late for work.  My husband and I stood for about 10 more minutes or so and stared at it while we hypothesized about what it could be.  Right before I got into my car, my husband gasped and he said, OMG, it disappeared!   When I turned back to look at it again, it was gone. I have no idea what it was, but I know that objects don't stay in one place for 30 minutes when they are in the sky.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
