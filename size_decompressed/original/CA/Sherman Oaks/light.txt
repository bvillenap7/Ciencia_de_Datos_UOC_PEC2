white light with flashing colored patterns;2003-02-09 01:45:00;10 minutes;white light with flashing colored patterns in the parking lot behind my workplace, which is around the vicinity of van nuys blvd and ventura, myself and two others noticed an extremely bright blinking star. we thought at first it was a jet because of its very pronounced pattern, but quickly observed that it was stationary. my coworker got his camera with a high power zoom lense so we could see the lights better, and we all took turns and confirmed the same observations: a BRIGHT white light in the center with red, blue and possibly yellow/green flashes, moving in a circular pattern around it. the distance appeared to be quite a ways off, but the intensity of the light made it very easy to see thru the lense. at this point my coworker began shooting pictures (we will develop tomorrow) and as he did I noticed 3 similar lights in a straight line approx. half as far as the first. we watched the lights for about 10 minutes and noticed they did shift positions but only slightly. it was freezing outside so we got into our cars and drove home. my head was out the window most of the time.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
Slow moving bright orange lights.;2008-12-13 23:50:00;10 - 15 minutes;Slow moving bright orange lights. I saw bright orange lights moving horizontally curving upwards, elevating slowly about 4-5 at a time, 12- 15 total.  They were not in formation and when they would reach a certain elevation the bright orange light would fade out and it looked like a far away star slowly.

Pin-point light in SoCal night sky suddenly increases speed until it disappears;2013-12-01 18:30:00;10 seconds;Pin-point light in SoCal night sky suddenly increases speed until it disappears. On Sunday night, December 1st 2013, my wife and my mother were heading down the rear steps of our apartment building when I noticed a small jet flying over.  We had been talking about how much air traffic there is in this part of the San Fernando Valley just a few minutes before heading outside. We stopped for a moment to watch the plane in its traffic pattern, and then my mother pointed out a point of bright white light, definitely higher than 40 thousand feet and moving at a very high rate of speed.  It was faster than a commercial or private jet, and not as high as a satellite in orbit.  The three of us all had our eyes fixed on it as it moved south/southwest in the dark night sky.  Suddenly, its rate of speed dramatically increased, and then it spectacularly appeared to ascend its altitude, upward, until it became invisible to the naked eye.  There was no sound from the object. There were very few stars visible.  The night sky over Sherman Oaks and Los Angeles is extremely polluted with light as you very well know.  Aircraft is easily visible, satellites can be made out with a trained eye…but this white light was so bright and clearly visible…it was an amazing sight. We all three stood there dumbfounded for a few seconds, and then I finally asked them did ya'll see that?  They both said nodded yes.  We were all in agreement that whatever we saw, it was unlike anything we'd ever seen in our lives.  We talked about it for the rest of the evening.  It was spectacular but very, very strange.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
