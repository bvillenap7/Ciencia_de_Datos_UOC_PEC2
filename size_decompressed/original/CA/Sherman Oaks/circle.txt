Blinking UFO in the South East sky of Los Angeles;2010-09-04 04:30:00;over an hour;Blinking UFO in the South East sky of Los Angeles Looking out at the dusk sky stars were pretty clear. One in particular was twinkling and when I took a closer look it was actually blinking an array of colors. I thought it was a plane or helicopter at first, but it was pretty stationary and very high up. There also appeared to be beams pointing upward and downward, 3 up and 2 down. I woke up my wife to witness it and she took a little interest and went back to bed. I recorded it on a digital video camera for about 40mins. It's 6am, now,  and it's still there. No sudden movements, just slight moves to the south and higher up from my point of view. Now most of the stars aren't visible, but this is along with the moon.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
White cicular objects in sky.;2015-04-12 09:05:00;20 minutes;White cicular objects in sky. Saw many circular white objects floating in the sky.  As many as 14.  Seemed to move with the air current, but would also move slowly in different directions.;34.1488259574469;-118.446727234042
