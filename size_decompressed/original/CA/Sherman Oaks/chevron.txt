Chevron-shaped flying boomerang with dim running lights on the bottom.;2015-09-18 22:00:00;8 seconds;Chevron-shaped flying boomerang with dim running lights on the bottom. The other evening, Friday September 18, 2015, we were in our backyard with friends, in Sherman Oaks, CA.  My friend was looking at the evening sky.  She is an interior designer.  She is quite visual and I am a painter and a teacher.   She said, what is that?  I looked up and we saw a chevron shaped flying something.  It looked like a boomerang with running lights along the bottom.  There may have been four or five lights on each arm of the thing.  The lights were extremely dim, bluish in color, but difficult to describe almost like eyeballs not really lights..   It was completely silent.  The only sound was us screaming at each other.  It was something real.  Maybe a military flying thing, but why would they be flying in Sherman Oaks, unless they were landing in Van Nuys?  Maybe a drone, but it looked like nothing either of us had ever seen before.  It was hard to tell how large it was.  I thought it was larger and higher than my friend.  But it had to have been quite high to pass over the tall trees.  My husband also saw it out of the corner of his eye.
