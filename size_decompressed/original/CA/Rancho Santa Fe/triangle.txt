2 triangles at 500 feet;2002-08-01 21:30:00;3 - 4 mins;2 triangles at 500 feet Walking down a dark sparsely populated road I noted 6 red lights grouped in the sky. Just as it struck me that that was strange, 3 of the lights started to move together. Then I saw the first triangle slowly turn -it was about 4 - 500 feet up-, and it slowly hovered away following the street until it was out of sight. When I saw the first craft start to move, I saw that there was a second craft that the other 3 lights belonged to, but when I looked back after following the first triangle, the second one was gone as well. Less than five minutes after they were gone, a long SUV vehicle game flying down the road, as if in pursuit. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.0024;-117.2128
