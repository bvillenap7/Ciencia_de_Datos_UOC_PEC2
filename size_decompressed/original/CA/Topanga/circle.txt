Was outside on our deck looking at the stars over the ridgeline to the west. Noticed flickering lights in the distance. Thought it might be an airplane but it didn't move for five minutes. Called to my fiance to come look, while I grabed my telescope. Through my telescope noticed a donut shaped object with red, blue, yellow and maybe green lights moving in a quick circular motion. Tried to take a picture with my camera but once I got in focus it disapeared.  I'm not the type of person who believes in this stuff, and I can usually come up with an explanation. But I don't know what to say about this. Wondering if someone else saw this object. It should have been seen clearly from Malibu to Ventura over the Pacific Ocean.;34.1107;-118.6049
Zipping green lights with loud noise.;2016-10-27 22:00:00;4 minutes;Zipping green lights with loud noise. Green lights hovering near mountain, zipping straight lines  below aircraft, then zipped quickly out into thin air ....  I did not witness it.  My daughter told us her story and said it was loud and the lights were so bright that she was surprised we did not hear or see it . We live in a very quiet neighborhood and there are no streets, streetlights or noise around. Only noise is the cry of coyotes and hoots if owls and other wildlife .;34.1107;-118.6049
