Blood Red light in night sky with no sound;2004-09-16 01:00:00;1min;Blood Red light in night sky with no sound Topanga 1:00am Twice i have seen something strange in one month.  This story is the second of the two.  Having my evening smoke and staring into the night sky.  I saw a very strange bright red light.  Comparing to other passenger planes. Normal craft has a blinking white light with a constant orange light. the light i saw was bright blood red.  Normal planes in the sky has a vibration, this didnt.  I saw it pass a plane the lights turned off and re-appeared in the same path it was on.  At first I thought i lost it and thought if it was a satelitte.  I know this wasnt a satillite cause this was zig zagging slowly.  Very hard to notice.  Also the red light patterns were 3 slow blinks then three seconds later they would repeat.;34.1107;-118.6049
