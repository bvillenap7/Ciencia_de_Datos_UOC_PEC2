White, circular glow of giant light above San Rafael on Wednesday night (11/09/2016);2016-11-09 21:30:00;>5 minutes;White, circular glow of giant light above San Rafael on Wednesday night (11/09/2016) At approx. 9:30pm, Weds., Nov. 9, 2016, as I was driving from the Richmond Bridge, to connect with 101 North, I saw what at first thought was the moon.  But, then realized that it was 1/4 the size of the moon.  As I drove into San Rafael, on the freeway, I was very confused trying to figure out what the h this object was.  It lit up the top half of the mountainside in San Rafael.  It was a round glowing thing.  As I got closer, it began to look like a white glowing hot air balloon, minus the top half, and it seemed like a person was hanging below it, air glider style.  Could it have been a helicopter at night?  But, I've seen a million helicopters at night, and it wasn't a helicopter.  As I rounded the 90degree bend in the highway, and continued north, the object was then behind the mountain, and I could no longer see it. Just then I realized that the moon was almost directly above me, so it was definitely not the moon.  The cars were all driving slowly, so other d! rivers surely saw this.  Anybody else see this tonight?;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
