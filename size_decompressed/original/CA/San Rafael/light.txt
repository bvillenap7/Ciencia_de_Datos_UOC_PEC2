Green light came down in the western horizon;2000-04-25 23:30:00;3 seconds;Green light came down in the western horizon My friend and I were driving home and we both saw an intense green light fall overhead to behind a hill in front of us. It had no tail.  It took three full seconds to drop down below a hill that was in front of us (which seemed very slow).  I've seen many shooting stars and meteors and this was nothing like that.  It had no tail, was not traveling that fast, and had a sharp intensity of color.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
A light similar to Venus increasing in intensity and velocity and then disappearing East into the night.;2002-08-11 21:20:00;5 sec;A light similar to Venus increasing in intensity and velocity and then disappearing East into the night. I was explaining the experiences I've been having over the past three weeks to my girlfriend and hoping I would have the opportunity to show her first hand what I've been seeing.  I began pointing out what various things look like in the sky. . .  planes, satalites, planets, etc, when in the northern sky I saw the familiar light.  It kind of looked like a planet, venus is in the southern sky right now and very beautiful, but it got much brighter.  It didn't necessarily flash, but it did increase in light intensity.  It then began to move in a Easternly direction and began to fade in light intensity. The more I look up at night between 9:30-12:00 the more I'm seeing this same phenomena.  I've seen it in WA, CA and WI where I can see enough stars to have a reference point.  Each time they look similar to stars, but increase and decrese in light intensity, change velocity and at times stop or curve in direction.  Anyone have any other ideas as to what this may be?;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
faint blue flashing object in the binoculars;2003-08-20 21:40:00;4 minutes approx;At approximately 9:40 pm waiting for Mars to rise high enough in the sky to observe easily with telescope and binoculars. I was observing the star Vega in the constellation of Lyra with a Meade refracting telescope and binoculars with a friend. When she commented that she had seen an faint blue flashing object in the binoculars just to the east of Vega. Passing the binoculars to me I panned slightly to the east of Vega and sure enough picked up a faint irregular flashing object on a northeastern heading. I was able to track the object for approximately 4 minutes. In that time it traversed possibly 15 degrees of the visible sky. At that point I lost the object from the field of view of the binoculars and wasn't able to pick it up again. This may have been one of the Cosmos Rocket (satellites/ space debris);38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
Bright blue object races across whole sky.;2007-04-09 21:35:00;6-10 seconds;Bright blue object races across whole sky. I was driving home from work on Monday  night at about 9:35 PM PST. I’m majoring in Astronomy and usually gaze at the stars as I drive home during the dark stretches. On Monday night this was the case. Through the front windshield a BRIGHT blue object raced across the sky from East to West at amazing speeds. Keep in mind I’m familiar with objects in the sky. This object was blue, It took only 6-10 seconds to cover the WHOLE sky, 180 degrees. It was brighter than any star in the sky, It was too slow to be any debris entering the atmosphere, the color also supports this. It was way to fast to be any earth made aircraft of any kind. Its path was direct and its brightness did not fade as it reached the horizon. I have seen many object in the sky including satellites that I have manually tracked with my telescope. This object was absolutely not a satellite. I hope others saw this as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
Still light object accelerates to right in night sky and disappears.;2009-08-27 22:15:00;3 seconds;Still light object accelerates to right in night sky and disappears. At approximately 10:15 PM, Thursday 8/27/09, I was star gazing in my back yard.  I was looking at the Bid Dipper constellation, and a previously still and fainter star nearby began to move.  The star like object made a short, slight awkward movement downwards, then accelerated about 5 inches to right in the sky according to my perspective.  After accelerating very quickly to the right for a short moment, it disappeared from view.  No flash or anything, just disappeared.  The object appeared just like a star in the sky, white and twinkling.  I am a recent college grad and interested in the ufo phenomenon.  The object did accelerate in a way that is consistent with some other videos of lights moving I have seen.  Slow, then very quick acceleration.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
Light cluster hovers then moves across the sky, changing colors white, blue, green;2012-02-04 22:00:00;3 minutes;Light cluster hovers then moves across the sky, changing colors white, blue, green My boyfriend and I were driving north on 101 from San Francisco to our exit in San Rafael.  About 3 min before reaching our exit we both noticed a relatively large white light (compared to all the stars that were visible in the sky at the moment) hovering over the sky.  My boyfriend had seen strange lights close Lagunitas, CA two times in the past 2 weeks.  However, this was my first time seeing anything like this. What seemed to be the one large white light split into three lights, like a cluster, and hovered in a random motion.  Seconds later, the light began flashing blue, green, and then white again.  The lights proceeded to head west across the sky in a rather accelerated speed.  As they quickly moved west, they began to drop into the horizon.  No known aircraft would go this fast across the sky and its movements did not resemble any craft I have ever seen. By this time, we were nearing our exit in San Rafael.  Our eyes were glued to these lights in disbelief.  I then asked my boyfriend to hang a right (west) to follow the lights.  Unfortunately, we drove west in hopes that we would see them, but they disappeared. It all lasted 2 to 3 minutes.  I would prefer to remain anonymous.

Not sure what this group of lights were?;2013-12-22 00:30:00;10 minutes;Not sure what this group of lights were? On Dec  22, 2013 at approximately 1230 am weather conditions:  wind calm from the north, barometer 30.12,  visibility 10 mi, humidity 100%, temperature 37degrees, a waning gibbous moon.  I had gone out to my washroom to retrieve a forgotten laundry load.  Exiting the house to enter the laundry room, I glanced to the east ward sky and noticed a warm bright star close to the moon.  I stopped to get bearings noticed it was in the constellation of Leo and the stars didn’t fit.  Then I noticed 4 others brighten and gently bob in the sky.  I thought at first that maybe this was an Iridium flare.  So I ran back into the house and grabbed both cell phones and began videoing the spectacle.  As I came out into the back yard the objects were moving slowly to the west towards the moon.  I then noticed 5 new lights rising from the east through the Coma Bernice’s.  For a total of 9 lights.  They continued rising gently from the east in a westerly direction toward the moon.  The first group of 4 winked out individually and at different times.  The second group continued to rise, not in orbital arcs, but in a gentle bobbling.  Unlike satellites, commercial planes or light aircraft. At about ten minutes after the first sighting,  The second group winked out to the north east of the moon.  Checking the Heaven’s Above website, there were no satellites in the area at that time.  I have realized that it is the winter solstice.  And these could be Chinese sky lanterns released in a celebration of that.   I consider myself an amateur astronomer.  I have seen many things in the sky.  These I haven’t seen this before.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
8 bright, star-like objects in formation in the night sky.;2014-01-06 22:18:00;0:03 minutes;8 bright, star-like objects in formation in the night sky Date: January 6, 2014 Time: 10:18-10:20pm PST Duration: approx. 2-3 minutes Location: 37°58’35”N, 122°29’34”W Direction of sighting: start = 315° NW end 280°W Angle of elevation: estimated at 30° above horizon, constant Sky condition: near total cloud cover – cloud base not known – guestimate 10-20,000 feet   Description:  My wife and I were in our hot tub, and had been in it for approximately 15 minutes when I noticed I noticed three bright objects about the size and brightness of planets (or the ISS) in the night sky – blue-white in color, twinkling.  We have lived at this address for seven years, and have had our hot tub almost as long, and have spend many hours looking up at the night sky here – we know what we’re looking at in the sky here. At first I thought it was an airplane, as I only glimpsed them through branches of a tree on our property.  We live on a flight path to SFO, so we get periodic commercial aviation traffic overhead – near enough to distinguish each wing, and the lights on them.  This was entirely different. Two of the lights were moving rapidly in together, with a third one behind them.  Distance between them was approximately 3-4full moons. They were heading south, toward the edge of the trees on our property, by leaning over the south edge of our hot tub we could see them emerge from behind the trees.  As they did, they joined up with another constellation of 7-10 similar objects that appeared to be stationary, at 280deg W.  These objects were oriented in a backwards capital letter “L” pattern, with approximately 3 objects oriented horizontally, sloping upward to the south, and a vertical line of 3-4 more going up.  They occupied a about 3 full moon’s worth of sky vertically, and maybe 2 horizontally.  They appeared to me to be quite uniform in size and color, and were twinkling (or perhaps flashing rapidly). At first I thought I was looking at an unusually bright (and severely compacted) version of the constellation Orion – that was the only thing I could think of that looks even remotely like this. As my wife and I watched and tried to figure out what we were seeing, the group of objects slowly began to change shape and appeared to move toward the south, where they eventually dimmed – probably fading into the clouds.  They still persisted dimly for some time – maybe another minute or two. We debated whether to go inside and grab a cell phone to take a picture, but this would not have been feasible in the low light conditions.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
Triangular and rectangular formations of hovering lights  over Bay;2016-02-21 21:30:00;25 minutes;Triangular and rectangular formations of hovering lights  over Bay I viewed a group of lights in various triangular or rectangular formations from 3 to 8 craft hovering in the same spot for a solid 20 to 25 minutes.  The objects were suspended over the Bay between San Rafael and like Berkeley.  The only movement of these objects was a slight change of shape from a perfect triangle to a more skinny V shaped triangle with 2 lights almost touching each other on one end-almost like a tweezer like formation.   Sometimes the lights would rotate around each other and change positions.  There was 4 or 5 main objects in this formation.  Unfortunately you pretty much needed to see this through binoculars because the lights were dimmed down pretty low but all of these 3 to 8 lights were definitely interacting with each other and for a solid 20 minutes this formation was visible from like 9:30 to around 10 P.M.  I was getting tired of holding the binoculars watching this for so long.  There was no flight path to these objects-the longest hovering formation I've seen.  I was not gonna say anything but this is the 4th night in February I've seen the lights-the other nights being 2-04,2-06 and 2-15.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
Pinpoint of light travels in even horizontal line;2020-08-15 01:30:00;3 seconds;Pinpoint of light travels in even horizontal line Saw a pinpoint of light travel horizontal across sky in my viewing direction of the Moon and Venus in the night sky.  It appeared, traveled in a straight line horizontal direction,very fast,then disappeared.  My estimate is 3 seconds viewtime.  It could not have been an airplane, because it was a pinpoint of light very far away, and airplanes dont travel that fast.  The light was constant and not flashing.  It could not have been a shooting star because it did not change its density of light.  It traveled horizontal, straight, even line, and shooting stars travel in a  falling, shooting motion.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
