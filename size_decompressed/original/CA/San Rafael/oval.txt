Sister and family see huge UFO at marin county civic center.;1973-06-01 13:00:00;20 minutes;Sister and family see huge UFO at marin county civic center Previously I reported on a huge UFO at the Marin County civic center when I was driving into the College of Marin.  MY sister and her two kids years later also saw a huge UFO just above hwy 101 at the marin county civic center.   The year of the sighting is based on best guess on my part recalling what she said.  On a side road above the hwy my sister was driving along when she was amazed to see a huge UFO below her hovring just over the hwy with traffic passing under it and no one appearing to notice the craft.   She atopped the car and got out to look at it and could have easily bounced a tennis ball off of it.  The craft was making faint humming noise but no one else appeared to notice it.  As she and her kids watched black helicopters came over the hill and they chased the UFO around in ghe air over head above San Rafael.   Finally the UFO took off flying north with the helicopters after it.  No one else still seemed to see the UFO.  Looking down on the hwy! traffic my sister thought what terrible fools they all were Years later black helicopters were involved in an attack on my sister   About the same time coming home late at night to my home in the deep woods I was surprized to hear deep heavy growls of a large animal in the dark.  I pulled my legally carried firearm and a dog whistle begain to blow recalling the animal.  The next night this same scenario was repeated with a dog whistle again calling off the large animal growling in the dark  Its a dangerous game to play ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Large orange dark object seen over S.F. Bay;2018-11-30 23:20:00;10 minutes;Large orange dark object seen over S.F. Bay I was watching what started out as a pulsating orange light bobbing up and down and hovering in the same general area.  After about 3 to 5 minutes of watching this light, a second light appeared real close on the right side.  It now looked like a large black object hovering over the Bay near San Rafael.   I looked away for a couple seconds to check the time on my watch, and when I looked back the object was gone.   The time was 11:20 P.M. . The weather was crystal clear and cold and there was a lot of strange lights swarming in this area.   The sightings started again on 11-24 and 11-25 after the fire smoke filled skies finally cleared after 16 days of bad weather.  It is amazing how nobody is ever outside when this activity is going on.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
On a bright moon lit night in California, three orange glowing objects were seen in the sky hovering, then ascending out of view.;2020-08-29 23:50:00;10 minutes;On a bright moon lit night in California, three orange glowing objects were seen in the sky hovering, then ascending out of view. At approximately 23:50, while exiting Highway 101, I noticed an object in the sky approximately 250-300 feet in the air over a shopping center across the street from my location.  The object was slightly oval and was flickering orange.  At first glance, I thought it was a light on a crane, until the object started to move.  I then thought it might be a helicopter.  I rolled down my window to hear it, however, the object made no noise.  I kept the object in view as I continued my drive three blocks down the road to my house.  When I exited my car, the object began to move towards my location and descended slightly in altitude. I immediately went into my home and got my 14 year old son to come outside and see what I was looking at.  As we both got outside, the object continued to hover over the intersection next to my home for about 30 seconds or so, then shot straight up in the air at an amazing velocity.  The object continued to climb until it disappeared. About 10-15 minutes later, I went outside and saw two more objects hovering at about the same location as the original object.  These two objects appeared to be identical to the first one and maintained the same distance from each other at all times.  Both my son and I took pictures of the objects and then as we began to discuss what we were seeing, both objects began the same maneuver that the first had done. We estimate the size of the objects to be about the size of a small automobile.  The objects flickered in the dark and had no other visible structure to them.  It should be noted that the sky condition was slightly smoky from nearby wildfires and the moon was creating sufficient light to create ample light to see non-illuminated objects in the area clearly.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
