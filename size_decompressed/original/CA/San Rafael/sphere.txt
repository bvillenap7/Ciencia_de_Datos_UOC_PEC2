Cluster of  lights in formation in  San Rafael hillside.;2015-11-04 22:00:00;30 minutes;Cluster of  lights in formation in  San Rafael hillside. I was watching a group of 5 to 10 objects in a straight line and at times in a triangular formation to the southeast of where I was standing.  These lights were incredibly bright at times and incredibly low just barely above treetop level.  5 of these lights would dip down behind the treeline and come up again and remain basically stationary sometimes a bright yellow gold and other times really dimly lit but still visible.   The object on the far right was giving off a purple and blue light as well as yellowish green at times.  I watched this object for a solid 20 minutes in basically the same spot hovering until it finally took off and started heading north very slow and silent.  All of these lights were just kind of swarming around each other and gradually moved to the southeast.  The 5 main objects were basically hovering from about 10 after 10 until about ten-thirty P.M.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
