UFO over San Rafael (Sorry.  I entered the wrong year in first report, please delete it).;2015-01-03 18:00:00;7 seconds;UFO over San Rafael (Sorry I entered the wrong year in first report, please delete it) On the evening of Jan. 3, 2015, my friend and I were driving to a neighborhood store and we saw a large “V” shaped pattern moving very fast in a straight line with no erratic movements.   It seemed to be high in the sky but large at the same time.  It was red, then as it turned green it suddenly just vanished.   It was a clear night with no clouds in the sky. It was approx. 6 to 6:15 I believe, and had just gotten dark.  We are located in San Rafael, Ca. It was not anything explainable.  We both said, wow?  What was that?  When we got to the store, a man was standing on the sidewalk waiting for his pizza looking up at the sky.  We asked him, did you see that and he said he did, but could not explain it. I would say the time duration was 6-7 seconds.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
