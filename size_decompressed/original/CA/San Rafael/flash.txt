I was sitting in my car with it running listening to the radio as I had just pulled up infront of my house when a sweeping striped light goes across the car and the radio reception disappeared the radio made a screeching noise  then two flashes right after the two flashes  two laser like beams shot acros the sky away from me then a final flash brighter and more orange in color than the first two. V ery startling, I tried to fallow whatever it was but the sky seamed untouched and by all means normal.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
