Winessed several white dots in the sky;2005-03-02 12:00:00;1 hour;Winessed several white dots in the sky The dots seemed to appear as if they were being laid down by unseen planes across, what started out to be a mostly clear sky.  These were not contrails.  In fact, that is one of the important points I would want to make about this.  There were several other planes in the sky that day, and they ALL made contrails.  This object, or formation of jets, made these white balls instead.  They would appear the way an image can be swiped onto a screen with a special effect.  Each group of rows were confined within in a rectangle-shaped area.  Although it is possible to have jets sky-write with a similar teqhnique, the width of the rows and the fact that we could not see any planes at all makes me doubt it.  Even though we could see all the other planes in the sky, including high altitude ones, which you could at least make out the mass of the body, i.e., darker area in the front of it's contrail, we could never locate the objects that were responsible, with the naked eye.  Also, this didn't take place in a small corner of the sky, it covered miles in several directions...back and forth several times before they disappeard.  I waited and watched for two more days, but it has been raining here, ever since we saw it.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
