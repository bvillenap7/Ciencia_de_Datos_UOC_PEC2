They were in the sky slightly south of Mount Tamalpais.  This view includes a lot of air traffic flying north or south to Bay Area airports 24/7.   The  lights  were so unusual I told several neighbors to come see something unusual.  I was delighted when they began to make remarks like that without any prompting.  After three minutes, two of the lights rose out of sight.  Then two more appeared from the original area and traveled horizontally as well.  The third one disappeared and it seemed to split at the last moment.  Finally, the fourth and fifth ones followed and I am certain some kind of split took place and they vanished after rising 30-45 degrees.
