Bright white, headlight beam of light, close to SF Bay in San Rafael,  north of SR/Richmond Bridge;2007-05-20 21:10:00;3 minutes;Bright white, headlight beam of light, close to SF Bay in San Rafael,  north of SR/Richmond Bridge 	At about 9:10 PM I was watching TV on my recliner and saw a large beam of white light, like the beam of car headlight, on the uninhabited ridge about ½ mile from the ridge where I live, close to SF Bay.  I faced East, toward SF Bay, just north of the San Rafael/Richmond bridge.  I scrambled off the recliner to the patio door and saw the circular beam of light slowly, steadily climb (like an airplane) in the sky it was not on the ground.  There is a small airfield near here and I just thought it was an airplane with a really, really big beam.  There was no way it could be reflected light of any kind.  I watched it rise for about 2 minutes it was really slow.  Then, of a sudden, it converted from a large circular beam of light and became what looked like the lights of a regular aircraft.  It moved slowly, then disappeared for a second or two and reappeared lower and three feet away for 2 seconds, then appeared where it had been.  It did this three times, then broke into another set of plane lights which, slowly, steadily flew to the northeast.  The original light slowly gained in altitude and disappeared to the south, toward the SR/Richmond Bridge.  This is the third incident, much less spectacular than the first, I have witnessed, all in the same place.  So, I decided to report it (and the other incidents, as well).;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
Strange blinking, saucer-like object spotted in SanRafael,CA apprx. 7:30 PM Standard time;2007-11-01 19:30:00;8 mins;Strange blinking, saucer-like object spotted in San Rafael, CA apprx. 7:30 PM Standard time Thursday November 1, 2007 I was driving in San Rafael, California with my Fiancé South on 101(toward San Francisco) and I spotted what we believe to be a UFO.  It looked exactly what you might see on TV or in the movies, a flying saucer.  It was very big, I’d say about the size of a full moon. It had colorful (blue and red to be sure) lights blinking from the bottom. Then we stopped the car on the side of the road, I was scared and shocked, I wanted someone else (besides us) to see it so, I ran out of the car and asked a man walking if he’d seen it. He said no so I had him follow me to a place it where it was very clear to see and asked him “Do you see that thing? It is a flying saucer” and he replied “Yes, I see it” he didn’t seem as shocked as I was. It appeared to be hovering back and fourth, but not really moving too much. Then I got scared and told my fiancé to drive but while we were driving I kept my eyes on it until it was hidden behind a mountain. Then about 40 seconds later when we passed the mountain and it was in sight again, I saw it was (had turned into) a blimp. The weird thing is that it looked nothing like what I’d just seen. When I got a better look at the blimp it read “FOR THE ‘IF’ IN LIFE”. I have never seen anything like that before but-I really do believe that the thing I saw was not normal. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe we spoke with this witness, although we cannot be certain.  She provides a paucity of information, so we cannot be certain it is the same person we spoke with over the telephone.  PD));38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
Falling object appeared to tumble in the sky.;2015-11-04 04:48:00;15 seconds;Falling object appeared to tumble in the sky. While driving to work this morning I saw an object falling from the sky.  It appeared to reflect light as it tumbled, leaving me to believe that it was not a meteor.  I have seen many meteors as an avid astronomer, and this was not one.   The object was to the East of highway 101 in central San Rafael.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
