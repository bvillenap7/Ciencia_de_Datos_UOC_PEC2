Mysterious aircraft in the bay area.;2005-08-05 21:30:00;15+ minutes;Mysterious aircraft in the bay area. Two friends of mine and myself were driving home going north on highway 101 coming from San Francisco.  It wasn't until we were near or passing through San Rafael that I spotted a light in the sky. Thinking it was nothing more than a helicopter or a plane I didn't pay too much attention to it. The more we drove up north I started to notice it was still in the same spot, so I thought ok, it must be a star, because its pretty bright and it ain't moving. Then finally when we got closer and closer, I started to noticed it wasn't even far off in space but just a few ways up in the sky. I was in the passenger seat so I witnessed this more than my friend did who was driving. Finally when I got a close look at it I notice there were two shining lights in front of the object and two red lights on each side. I could barely make out the shape of this mysterious craft which was rectangular. It didn't hit me that this was more than an airplane or a star when we actually drove underneath it and it was obvious that it was staying completely still and only a few hundred feet up in the air. But mostly I want to know if anyone else has repoted anything similar and  in this area on that very same night and time.;38.0017583941606;-122.547981751825
