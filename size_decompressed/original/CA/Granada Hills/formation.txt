The yard appeared undisturbed, but then a strip of green lights very high up in the sky caught my attention, moved sideways in an orderly manner at first, and then in a quick motion never seen before by any airplane or helicopter.  It then seemed to turn so I could get a better view of it.   I know this sounds crazy, but it seemed to be letting me know that it knew I had seen it… sort of like a confirmation.  Then it quickly descended, then darted upward and went behind a tree.   I tried to dismiss it in my mind as a drone so I’ve spent the last hour or so calming myself down and researching on the net.  No drone flies that high or moves that way.  This was a true sighting.  I didn’t think this would ever happen to me.  Glad there was someone to report it to.   Wondering if anyone else in the neighborhood saw i! t.  They’d have to be looking up at precisely the same time as me because it was only in view for approximately 10-15 seconds.  Thank you for collecting this data. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.2773;-118.5001
