Appeared to be dancing in the night sky!  It suddenly lurched rapidly in a southerly direction.  Then it moved up straight up and then back and forth. Tried to get my phone to capture video but it moved so fast all of a sudden.  Seemed to move south very rapidly.  It then faded out of view.;36.9102;-121.7564
