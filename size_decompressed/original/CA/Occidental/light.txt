Bright lights in the north western skies above Occidental Ca.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius.  PD));2012-01-28 23:00:00;most every night for 2 we;Bright lights in the north western skies above Occidental Ca. For the past couple of weeks, almost every night, around the same time,  I have seen a huge bright light, it is bright white but red and green lights occasionally flash.  It moves very erotically ((sic. Erratically?), slowly and then it will move north and set for a time and then it goes south, hovering and pulsating.  Strange. I would like to know if anyone else has seen this.  In the North western skies above Occidental.;38.4117;-122.9918
