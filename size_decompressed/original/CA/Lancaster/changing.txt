Flying Manta Ray.  ((anonymous report));2008-08-10 08:00:00;8;Flying Manta Ray We saw something coming from the sky at a very high velocity, we can even see the trail of gas and fire like watching a meteor.  It was similar to a manta ray, it was dark grey, it had like holes or gills under its flaps or fins, on both sides.  It made a loud screeching sound, it was flying or hovering at very high speeds, it could stop and stay still, but changing its shape, then all of the sudden it desappear into thin air, then it would come back and entertain us a liitle bit more.  That was a living creature and not a space craft, it also had like fins moving around like it would under water, but we couldn't even take a picture or video, because it was very scary watching that creature.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
Orange-red crescent shaped object in sky, approximately 10 miles west of Lancaster City Park.;2014-07-30 22:30:00;10 minutes;Orange-red crescent shaped object in sky, approximately 10 miles west of Lancaster City Park. Object was shaped like a half-moon.  Over the span of approximately one minute, the object's bottom half dissolved.  Then, two red orbs descended from the bottom of the object.   It slowly began to reform back into a crescent shape, and then proceeded to disappear. Five minutes later, the object reappeared 10 miles to the north, in the same section of the sky.  During the second appearance, it maintained its crescent shape for the duration of its visibility.  It once again began to fade and completely disappeared.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
