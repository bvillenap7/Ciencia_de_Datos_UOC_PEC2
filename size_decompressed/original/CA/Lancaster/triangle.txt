I went with friends to watch a meteor shower in the desert. It was late at night and we could hear normal night desert sounds. We were all watching the falling stars when one person noticed lights slowly approaching. As the lights neared us we saw three triangle shaped craft flying in a triangle formation. The craft were (RAM?)black, with three lights on each one. I do not remember which lights were red and which were white, but each craft had red and white lights on the 3 points. The craft were 500 to 1000 feet above us as they went past. They were moving at about 350 mph judging by how low they were and how long it took them to pass. They were completely silent, as they passed we still heard the desert night sounds. there were no car engines running or lights on,(so I do not know if they would have had any effect on them,) as we were all watching the sky. Most of us they worked at the air force plant and held security clearances,  but none of us had ever seen any craft like that before. We were all used to watching fighters and bombers fly by, so were used to judging aircraft size and speed. We had never saw an aircraft that was a perfect triangle float past us at 350 mph though! They flew/floated overhead and vanished in the distance. The profile of the craft were very low. We saw the light before we saw the craft and the craft outline vanished before the lights disappeared. We were used to seeing F117 fighters, and these were not shaped like them. I worked briefly on the first F22's and they were not flying yet. Besides, both of these craft make a lot of noise and cannot glide that long and that low without power. This craft was powered by magnetics or atomic/nuclear fuel. There was no exhaust vents visible on the trailing edge of any of the three craft. It was probably 11:30 at night and as they passed no heat from them distorted any stars behind them as they passed. I heard of Art Bell seeing a single triangle craft abou! t the same time, or a bit after we saw these three. The artists rendition of his craft on his web page makes the craft way to big. They were all three the size of an F15 or F16, not any bigger than that. I realize this happened in 1993, and it is now 1998, but I told the story to people I worked with when I was transferred from Palmdale to Everett, Wa. Those people could vouch that I told them about it in 1993. Besides, I did not know who else would care, as it was not the classic round ball of light or flying saucer sighting, and we did not have any camera's.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
dark triangular object that emitted a stange sound;2000-05-15 22:00:00;20 sec.;dark triangular object that emitted a stange sound My girlfriend, my uncle, and I were taking a drive through the desert, when I looked up at the stars and they disipeared (there were no clouds) and we seen a dark triagular object hovering in the sky just above us. There was a strange pulsating humming sound coming from the object. There were no lights at all on or around the object. It disipeared about 20 sec. after we saw it.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
Wedge shaped object;2004-07-17 21:00:00;40-45 min;I took my pup out around 9pm and was sitting in the entryway waiting for her when I saw a shadow pass by.  Being afraid owls would take the pup and my chihuahua, who was also out, I walked out onto the lawn to see how many owls there were and to keep and eye on the dogs. What I saw instead was a wedge shaped object circling in about a mile and half radius. It was first colored a bright blue/green. I got the impression of metallic coloring, then after about 20 minutes had a rainbow like color rippling through it. I observed it going in a clockwise manor then abrubtly change direction and go counter-clockwise. It would then go in a rectangular pattern or triange....zip south to north in the blink of an eye. It would stop and just hover, or it seemed would hide behind trees from my view.  I know this sounds nuts, but it was real. The entire time I was watching this thing my chihuahua was barking like crazy at it and my adult lab was just watching it. I was very intriqued by this craft or object since I do see numerous craft from AF Plant 42 which is 2 miles away. This object made no sound whatsoever....it did cast a shadow though.... I became concerned when it appeared to get lower with each lap in it's circle..... After 40-45 minutes I went into the house and do not know how much longer it was out there...... I did see at one point when it appeared to be coming straight at me that it appeared to me like 2 wedges with a space between them with lights through the whole point and back both sides. I don't know exacly how high it was, but would estimate about the height of small aircraft, not 30,000 like commercial planes.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
Triangular craft flies over highway... low altitude... then disappears only to reappear later;2005-01-12 19:05:00;20 Minutes;Triangular craft flies over highway... low altitude... then disappears only to reappear later I was driving South on the 14 freeway near the Gorman Junction when a triangular shaped craft crossed the freeway traveling East directly in front of my truck at about 50 to 75 feet in altitude. Through my windshield I could see the craft clearly as it stood out from the orange haze of the city lights.  It was dark colored, black and grey with a patterned design on the bottom.  It didn't look metallic, there were no reflections.  It had a dim white light at each point and a very bright pulsing white orb directly in the center underneath.  It flew somewhat slowly, in a gliding motion, rotating slowly and emitting no sound.  I exited the freeway at Gorman road and turned East to watch it.  It traveled low and slowly along the outskirts of Lancaster before circling around the city and vanishing in the mountains to the south.  I snapped serveral pictures with a disposable of the craft as it flew around the city.  (I will send a copy if they come out.)  After the craft disappeared, I got back on the freeway heading South once more.  About a mile from the Antelope Valley Mall the craft suddenly appeared to the East. It glided over the freeway again!  I know the cars behind me had to have seen it.  It flew directly over them.  This time I could see the craft at eye level as there is a slope to the east.  I was unable to grab my camera and the craft flew behind me and into the west somewhere.  There were other planes in the area at the time and I am sure that what I encountered twice was no conventional aircraft.  There were many other witnesses on the freeway that night that must have seen this thing.  It was huge... AND... It practically flew right over Lancaster.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
Three Silver Reflective Triangular Shaped Objects Over Lancaster CA Sky With Two Other UFO's;2014-03-24 05:53:00;3 minutes;Three Silver Reflective Triangular Shaped Objects Over Lancaster CA Sky With Two Other UFO's On March 24, 2014, at 5:53am, I was outside early morning in the backyard.  I saw three reflective silver triangular shaped objects in a triangular formation the northwest sky moving upward, twirling and reflecting.     There was a fourth triangular shaped object that was bleeping bright red light and moving back and forth between two of the silver reflective objects on the southwest side of the triangular formation.   I also saw a very bright light extended far out from one of the triangular shapes (not on the side where red bleeping triangular shaped object was moving back and forth.  The bright light was shaped like a fat hazed cross.   All of these objects were moving upward in the sky in a triangular formation.   I went into my house to get my camera and when I returned the strange objects where gone.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
((HOAX??))  Triangular flying aircraft with rainbow colored lights.;2015-07-06 22:27:00;5 minutes;Triangular flying aircraft with rainbow colored lights. I heard a sound like a helicopter outside.  I saw the whit light shining on homes but realized it also had rainbow colored lights.  It circled my building several times before leaving.  It was shaped like a triangle. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above, to reflect a nighttime sighting.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information, so we are unable to confirm the time.  PD));34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
