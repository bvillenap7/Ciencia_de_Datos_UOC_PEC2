The objet we saw was no doubt a top secret project from the goverment or it was a alien craft.What ever it is i have seen it on many t.v. shows since.(such as sightings);34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
Dissolving Stars  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites.  PD));2005-06-05 21:00:00;8 to 10 seconds;Dissolving Stars We live in the High Desert of Los Angeles County.  Since the beginning of June up to the most recent event last week, we keep seeing what we call, for lack of a better term, dissolving stars.  We are reporting this to see if anyone else is seeing the same thing.  It usually happens between 9pm and 11pm when we take our dogs out into our backyard before bedtime. We sit in our chairs facing the northern sky and look at the stars.  The star enters our field of view from the northwestern sky (around the 10 o'clock position), and flies in a steady but very erratic up/down pattern. It then flys to the northeast (around the 1 o'clock position) at a steady speed, keeping its up/down erratic pattern, and then suddenly...poof! It's gone.  Since the beginning of June we have witnessed this event 6 times. It is a steady, bright looking star and has no flashing lights, identifiable form, etc. Has anyone else seen these stars?  We definitely know from the flight pattern that it is entering or near to entering restricted airspace over Edwards Air Force Base. We have numerous flights of commercial and personal aircraft over our house on a daily basis- but not one of them ever fly into the airspace heading towards Edwards. There is a definite flight pattern these normal aircraft take around this restricted airspace- and yet, these stars head into that direction until they dissolve. Very unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  The witnesses probably are observing satellites fly into the shadow cast by the Earth.

Two things got me more interested in this flight.  Whatever it was, it was not running regulation navigational beacons, and it was entering restricted airspace over Edwards AFB (northeast of my location).  What at first looked like landing lights, started to slowly pulsate.  As the object traveled further east, this pulsating light was still visible, making it impossible to be landing lights.  If you are thinking this possibly was general aviation, I have seen a few general aviation off-regulation navigational lights in the past, but read-on -- this gets better).  I got a pair of binoculars and was able to follow the object for another minute, as it got further east.  I lost it when the glare from street lights interfered.  My most interesting (and without explanation) observation of this object was when what appeared to be two smaller lights separated from the main object.  The lights were colored (one was red and one green or blue).  They seperated vertically, one departing straight up and one straight down. They were visible just for a second.  At this time, I was viewing the object thru binoculars.  After the sighting, I viewed the area of seperation again, just to see if it was possibly caused by binocular glare/reflections, but could not see anything that would cause the effect.  And, oh yes, I have seen military aircraft fire off flares before.  These were not flares.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
They were spaced evenly and formed a Horizontal line.;2008-01-09 19:10:00;5 min;They were spaced evenly and formed a Horizontal line. My friend came and told me that we were probably being invaded. I ran out and i saw 2 lights. Those lights were much too big to be an air plane or helicopter. They seemed to be the same color as a dimmed street light but in the sky. These lights stood still maybe even hovered. About a minute later other lights appeared forming a Horizontal line. Eventually the lights seemed to be moving in a diagonal manner. They later faded and disappeared into the night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
Red light got bright ..changed to blue went across sky got bright blue and vanished with a blue trail.;2014-07-02 03:00:00;3-5 minutes;red light got bright ..changed to blue went across sky got bright blue and vanished with a blue trail approx. 2:30 to 3 am (not sure). was facing westward. apprx 30 degree angle above horizon. a red light shining steady.  I initally thought was an aircraft.  the light then increased in brightness to the point it looked like a police helicopter searchlight pointed fowards, and remained a definite red color.  it appeared to be traveling towards me.(eastward).  it then changed to a blue color and began drifting to its right (my left) and remained at the same altitude. object traveled at a medium pace .  similar to a passenger aircraft but a bit faster. traveled from almost directly west to southwest point as a small bluish light ..it then increased in brightness as a blue color (as bright as the red got).and vanished.it appeared to leave a brief blue trail after for 5-7 seconds ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Flying object in the skies of Antelope Valley, California;2014-10-04 20:00:00;3 minutes;Flying object in the skies of Antelope Valley, California We see all kinds of strange flying objects out here in the desert, and since we're in the same region as Edwards Air Force base, NASA, Virgin, etc. it's to be expected.  However, on Saturday evening around 8:00 pm there was a flying object like we'd never seen.  It had a blue light on top and a red light on the bottom.  At first I thought it was one of the drones that flies over the valley every night, but then it started going up and down, then sideways and stop in mid-flight.  It wasn't a plane and it wasn't a helicopter.  I have never seen the drones act in this particular fashion either.  It lasted around three minutes.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
