Retired aerospace employee witnesses loud, flying sphere near Edwards AFB.;2003-09-18 11:30:00;1 minute;Retired aerospace employee witnesses loud, flying sphere near Edwards AFB. Telephoned Report:  A gentleman called Edwards AFB in California to report an unusual sighting he had had at between 11:00 a.m. and noon, he estimated, on Thursday morning in Lancaster, CA, northeast of Los Angeles.  Edwards AFB call-forwarded the witness to NUFORC.    The witness reported that he had just opened a garage door at approximately between 11:00 a.m to noon., he thought, when his attention was immediately drawn to the sky by a humming or buzzing noise, which he at first thought was caused by an aircraft engine.  Very quickly, as he visually scanned the sky to locate the source of the sound, he spotted its apparent source, a peculiar looking luminous sphere, which looked somewhat like the head of a (straight) pin.  It appeared to the witness to be self-luminous, rather than reflective, he thought, and the object was in the northern sky, moving slowly to the south, and executing a steady turn to the southwest.  Its apparent size he equated to noticably larger than that of a large star in the night sky.  As the witness watched the object, it completed its turn to the west, and it accelerated and disappeared from his sight over the mountain range to the west of Palmdale.  The witness spent several decades working in the aerospace industry, and in other technically oriented industries, as well.  He served in the U. S. military, during which time he flew aboard many different types of military aircraft.  He emphasized that the object he witnessed was not any type of conventional, or aerodynamic, craft, in his opinion, and the sound it seemed to come from it was unusual, something he had never heard before.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
