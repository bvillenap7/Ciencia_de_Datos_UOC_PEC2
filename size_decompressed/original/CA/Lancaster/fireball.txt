Very loud humming sound with a very bright bluish red flash. then a fire started as a result of the light.;1999-08-15 16:30:00;10 sec.;Very loud humming sound with a very bright bluish red flash. then a fire started as a result of the light. We were driving down the street and a very loud humming sound came up beside out truck.. at first we thought it was a bird but then at that moment there was a bright orange light with a blue trail behind it.. right next to the drivers side of our truck... the humming sounded like a 200 lb bumble bee. We thought at first maybe a bird had hit a power line and was electrictuted.  My husband looked in his rear view mirrow and said he saw a streak then saw alot of smoke.. So we turned the truck around and headed back by this time there was a pretty good size fire.  We looked all around and saw there were no power poles involed or any dead birds around.. Another car pulled up and ask what happened. I breifly told them what we heard and saw. They said they saw something up high and then all of a sudden if fell and they then saw the smoke also.. but he said it didnt look like an object just something in the air.. the sun would of been directly in front of him so maybe this interfiered with what he saw.. this was also about the time of the ending of the metor shower in aug.. I was wonder if it could of been a metor.. My husband walked over to the fire chief and tried to explain to him was we heard and saw but the fire chief just blew him off like he was a kook or something... I dont ever think I will forget that sound or the strange color light I saw... It is still hard to explain. Also there were no clouds around so that let lightening out of the picture.

Large orange light moving out of the w.s.w. to the e.s.e over lancaster, ca. area 02:31;2005-03-10 02:31:00;3 minutes;Large orange light moving out of the w.s.w. to the e.s.e over lancaster, ca. area 02:31 Large orange light approx. size and color of a mercury vapor street lamp at about 1 half mile. out of west about 5 degrees south of due west about 35 degrees above the horizon moving eastwardly. speed remained constant slightly slower than a sattilite, however did appear to have a woble.  At about 60 degees above the horizon I was able to get binoculars and observed a smaller light in close proximity to main body of light. Smaller object was approx. 1/10th size of main body and moved from the north side of the larger light to west side and back again.  As object reached perigee at about 8o degrees above southern horizon light began to fluctuate and then went dark. I was able to track the dark body for about 1-2 seconds after light went out at 02:34.   Sky was clear low temps,low humidity, ground level is 2600 ft asl.  First impression was probaly a meteor although no smoke or con trail was seen. Opinion has changed due second sighting 9 days later which I will fill out a second report for.  Should be noted that Vandenburg AFB is about 160 miles due west of my house and I have seen rocket launches from Lancaster this was not a launch as Vandenburg shoot to the west.  Secondly Lockheed Skunk Works is located 5 miles south of me and Edwards AFB is 11 miles north east. I have seen many of the latest airplnes that test at edwards the object I saw did not appear to be terestrial.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559

This object look like a fireball coming towards us from the West in the direction of the Pacific Ocean, it looked like it was coming st;2020-07-14 22:00:00;15-25 seconds;This object look like a fireball coming towards us from the West in the direction of the Pacific Ocean, it looked like it was coming straight at us at first and then was going straight across the sky in front of us not at a very high altitude, looking like it was burning and sparking the entire time it was in our site it looks to be maybe 50 miles to the north of us, and as I stated it came all the way from the Western Horizon as far as we could see and we watched it pass in front of us all the way to the Eastern Horizon as far away as we could see until it was out of sight.  But it maintained the orange sparking Fireball round shape the entire time and we watch this or at least 15 to 20 seconds.  The object was more orangish red in the middle and a sparking yellow orange around the object.  I would really like someone to contact me so I can speak with somebody about this.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
