TWO GOLDEN DISCS CROSSED THE NIGHT SKY, VERY RAPIDLY, STRAIGHT LINE, SILENT.;2000-07-01 22:50:00;30 SECONDS;TWO GOLDEN DISCS CROSSED THE NIGHT SKY, VERY RAPIDLY, STRAIGHT LINE, SILENT. LAYING ON LOUNGERS IN THE BACK YARD, MY WIFE REMARKED THAT AN OBJECT WAS GOING ACROSS THE SKY (CLEAR STARRY NIGHT). I LOOKED TO SEE A GOLDEN YELLOW DISC TRAVELLING RAPIDLY ON A SOUTH TO NORTH TRACK, MAYBE A FEW DEGREES WEST OF NORTH, IN TOTAL SILENCE WITH NO TAIL, AT A RAPID RATE OF SPEED. THE VISUAL DEFINITION OT THE DISC WAS VERY CLEAR AND APPEARED TO HAVE 'TEXTURE'. I JUMPED UP AND RAN FURTHER FROM THE HOUSE AS THE OBJECT PASSED IN A STRAIGHT LINE, DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW OVER THE ROOF LINE. TURNING BACK I SAW A SECOND DISC FOLLOWING THE SAME TRACK, MAYBE 6 TO TEN SECONDS BEHIND THE FIRST. I WAS ABLE TO MOVE FURTHER FROM THE HOUSE AND OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAN THE FIRST, SEEING THE DISC 'BANK' SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT THEN REALIGN TO ITS ORIGINAL TRACK. THE 'BANK' WAS MANIFESTED NOT ONLY BY THE CHANGE OF TRACK BUT ALSO BY A CHANGE IN PLAN FORM, AS WITH A FLAT DISC. THE FIRST DISC WAS SEEN FROM AN ANGLE OF ELEVATION APPROX 70 DEGREES SOUTH TO 30 DEGREES NORTH (OVER THE ROOF LINE), AT AN ANGLE OF APPROX 70 DEGREES WEST. THE SECOND FOLLOWED THE SAME TRACK BUT WAS OBSERVED SOONER, AT APPROX 60 DEGRES SOUTH, TO APPROX 20 DEGREES NORTH. ALTITUDE IS GUESSED AT 10000 + FT, AND SPEED MACH 4/5. EACH DISC WAS VIEWED FOR APPROX 6/7 AND 8/9 SECONDS RESPECTIVELY OVER A TOTAL TIME SPAN OF MAYBE 20/25 SECONDS. I CALLED THE FBI AND THE SHERRIF'S DEPARTMENT WITH A BRIEF REPORT AND CONFERRED WITH AN FAA NEIGHBOR. THE NEIGHBOR CALLED THE FAA CENTER IN PALMDALE AND CONFIRMED THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME REPORTED ACTIVITY. MY WIFE CORROBORATES THE ABOVE DETAILS. I AM RETIRED AFTER 45 YEARS IN THE ENGINEERING FIELD OF MILITARY AND CIVIL AVIATION. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke to this witness at considerable length, and found him to be an exceptionally qualified observer and reporter of what he and his wife had just been witness to.

After seeing many stars, I saw this bright yellow light just staying in one position.  On the edges were blue and it just stayed in that same place. It looked like a scene from starwars going into light speed.  The craft got really bright then zoomed off leaving a trail of yellow. It really reminded me of starwars because thats exactly how it looked.  I was amazed and couldnt believe it. My friends wouldnt believe me either.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
While taking pictures of clouds, observed dics shaped object hovering in front of the clouds.;2006-10-04 14:30:00;3-5 minutes;While taking pictures of clouds, observed dics shaped object hovering in front of the clouds. I was taking pictures of the clouds from my front yard, saw a disc shaped object hovering in front of the clouds. I was trying to figure out what it was when it shot to the left a short distance then straight up on a 90 dgree angle, it moved back to the right is when I took a picture. before I could take another picture it moved straight up and into the clouds out of sight. It was gray in color, the day was bright with high clouds, little wind. The sighting lasted about 3-5 minutes. This is the second sighting within a week of a strange object, the first sighting was at night.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
Multi colored round disk object hovers down toward ground then straight back up FAST;2011-08-29 22:00:00;1 minute;Multi colored round disk object hovers down toward ground then straight back up FAST Entering this report for my sister:  I was driving on the road at 50th St East going toward Avenue K. I had just passed Ave L and a small house on the side of the road to my right (in the direction toward 60th).  Through my peripheral vision I could see an object moving quickly toward the ground in a straight line. I turned to look at it since it caught my attention. The object was emanating many colors, I couldn't tell what color it was exactly, it was as if it was cycling through many colors at once. There was no point from which lights were coming, the whole object was THAT color or colors all at once as it moved, it wasn't SHINING and it didn't project any beams of light.  The object looked to be round in shape however not a sphere, more like a donut shape or a wheel but no hole in the middle or at least I couldn't see one it moved too fa st. Once it reached near the ground I lost sight of it for a split second as if it disappeared completely. Then it reappeared and moved straight back up. Not at an obvious an! gle like a plane or any angle I could tell.  Simply straight back up.  I was still moving toward the object the entire time (which was about 3 seconds).  Once I saw it moving up toward the sky I tried leaning forward to look and see if I could catch it again but it was already gone. The object had only been gone for a second when my phone started beeping low battery, that scared me further. I had also heard a static noise when I first saw the object, I was talking over speaker phone and over my car's speakers so when I heard the static it was quite noticeable.  The distance from me in my car driving toward it at around 65 mph to where it was is probably about a football field in length, it wasn't very far but it wasn't close enough that I could see many more details and it didn't linger. It was a very scary few moments.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
Metallic disk in sky east Lancaster, CA.  ((anonymous report));2016-06-04 17:00:00;5 minutes;Metallic disk in sky east Lancaster Watering my backyard lawn, looking towards the east towards Edwards Air Force base, me and my friend spot a silver metallic disk shape saucer thing between a pocket in a cloud.  me and my friend stay staring at it for about 1 minute, pondering and trying to guess what it is, knowing as I always see planes on coming from that same way I thought it was just a training drill or some plane from the base, but then as we are looking at it we watch as the UFO wobbles like a flimsy frisbee out of the clouds to the right into a clear part of the sky, I've never seen any plane maneuver the way that metallic disk did, it wobbled from the cloud to a part of the sky so fast and stopped and stood still so fast like with slight ease,  I know it wasn't a drone either by the way this hung wobbled in the air just to change its position, it moved about several hundred feet within seconds and as it stood in the spot it was it didn't wobble, and it just started to gleam and disappear, as if it was going directly east from where it was disappearing unnaturally.  Seeing it move in the air was the strangest thing I've ever seen, and it was very far.  I, never going to forget the way it maneuvered, almost like a 50,s alien up movie,  it looked like a common or what I think to be common UFO.
