At first I thought it was a satellite and I asked my wife to come out and see the satellite. Then the dot turned left and I knew it was not what I thought. I then saw a second dot traveling at a right angle to the initial direction of the first dot. The first dot then made a U-turn and the two dots proceded to converge on each other. As they got closer to each other they disappeared. I asked my neightbor to come into the street and the three of us witnessed this.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559

huge bright light moving crazily in the sky and then disappearing in lancaster, california and have a video.;2008-01-20 21:52:00;1.5 minutes;huge bright light moving crazily in the sky and then disappearing in lancaster, california and have a video. On January 20, 2008, at 9:52PM pacific-time, in Lancaster, California, ((name #1 deleted)) and ((name #2 deleted)) were out walking their dog.  All of a sudden the street got extremely bright and ((name #1)) looked up.  He saw a bright, circular light moving in many directions and was stunned.  Only one bright circle was observed but there were 3 or 4 huge flashes of light that accompanied it and that the circle light would travel into. The lights were all white.  It disappeared out of thin air, and the street became dark again. ((name #1)) is 15 years old and ((name #2)) is 14. ((name #1)) was able to capture a 10 second clip of his sighting on his Motorola cell phone.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
Bright orange light over E. Lancaster Desert;2008-11-18 16:50:00;1 minute;Bright orange light over E. Lancaster Desert Standing in the desert at 65th street west and Ave J, looking to the east I saw a bright orange object floating in a downward trajectory.   At first I thought it was a southwest passanger airliner headed to Burbank, however the color became a glaring bright orange.  I then thought it was the reflection of the sun setting behind me, although I could not account for a reflection from the sun, as the sun was falling behind the mountains at this time.  Its downward trajectory then sped up and I thought it was a plane going down.  It stopped floating hung for a few seconds and then disappeared.  It was either a huge meteor burnign in the earth's atmosphere or something from Edwards.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
White glowing circular light flies across sky for only a moment then disappeared.;2013-07-22 01:30:00;5 seconds;white glowing circular light flies across sky for only a moment then disappeared I saw a bright while light fly across the sky for what seemed like only a second and then disappeared!  I mean literally just disappeared didn't fly off into the distance... just poof and it was gone!   It was high up in the sky, very bright, circular and white...  It was in between Rosamond, CA and Lancaster CA.   My husbands friend saw something the night before while on his porch in the same area.  It was late at night around 1:30-1:45 AM on Monday the 22nd of July.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
Round, solid white, high altitude object moving S to NE over Antelope Valley, CA.  Non specific side to side motion.;2015-07-11 05:00:00;15 minutes;Round, solid white, high altitude object moving S to NE over Antelope Valley, CA.  Non-specific, side-to-side motion.  No sound, no blinking lights. July 11, 2015, 5AM ~ Round, solid, white lighted object moving slowly over Antelope Valley, CA.  First seen from the south, moving in a wide back and forth (meandering?) motion, ultimately disappearing in the east/north-east skies of the valley.   I thought it was a plane or helicopter at first, but it made no sound, had no blinking lights, and moved oddly for a craft carrying people.  It was too bright, and didn't fly in a motion similar to satellites or the ISS.  When directly overhead it appeared extremely high in the sky.  As it moved north-east of my position it headed towards a small, very high cloud formation that had that wind swept look to it and I expected it to go under the cloud.  Instead, it disappeared into the cloud and emerged a few moments later.  I lost view of the object soon after, due to the distance from my position.  The entire time it took to travel over the valley took about 15 minutes.  The reason I was out at that time in the morning was being awakened by emergency vehicles that had been at my neighbor's house. I am a retired aerospace technician.  I worked over 20 years, with experience on aircraft and spacecraft.  I have also lived in the Antelope Valley, off and on approximately 25 years beginning in 1975.  This is the first time I've seen something like this in the skies over the Antelope Valley, California.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559

I looked up, and far up in the sky was a bright glowing, round like shape, and thought maybe  planet was bright, but the sky was pitch black, and no stars or planets could be seen. I grabbed my Galaxy 10 plus phone and zoomed my camera up to it, and held my camera still. This ball- like shape was now seen to spin and leave an aura of light around it, and it would spin out of my camera view, though holding it steady,  to make sure I wasn't moving it. Then I'd find it again, and it would move again, sometimes moving very fast in a zipping motion and fast speed. I filmed it, then was freaked out a bit, and sat down at my table to watch it, and a light bulb burned out in the small chandelier above my table, freaking g me out more..lol.I sent it to several friends, but most were sleeping, one was up and said they hoped it wasn't a meteor.I said a meteor or satellite even wouldn't move like this, zipping, and moving that way. First time I am reporting this, but have seen these fast lights before, and there were many of them in a small group..never caught them on camera tho.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
