Cylinder object flying low with three balls of light.;2005-03-07 09:00:00;20 min;Cylinder object flying low with three balls of light. As we were driving out of Wal-mart on the East side of Lancaster, my girlfriend noticed a orange light in the air right above the parking lot about 20 to 30 feet in the air. It was a cylinder shape with three balls of lights in a triangular pattern on the bottom of it, you can tell it was a cylinder shape because its lights were reflecting off itself to reveal its shape.  It hovered overed the parking lot for about 5 min. and then began to move south east - we then caught up with the flying object and got out and looked at it, we heard no sound of a engine, or no smoke or any sign of a normal aircraft. And it was small, about 1 to 2 ft. in diameter and about 3 to 4 feet tall. Any way, then we followed it south east down the street and parked and watched this object fly real high into the night sky, as it got higher in the air the lights got brighter. It then reached a point to where it stop getting higher.  As we watched, one of the little balls of light broke off and fell then quickly disappered. Then after about 2 min. the whole thing disappered. It disappered for about 30 seconds then reappered. It sat in the sky for about 1 more min. then it just flickered away.  The thing is, having seen it at about 25 ft. above my car and hearing no engine, and then watching it go as high as planes, i cant figure out any aircraft that can silently move from above my head to that kind of altitude as silently and smoothly as it did.  We were not the only witnesses, in the wal mart parking lot, people were snapping pictures with their phones and pulling over to look at this light. For me and my girlfriend this is the first time we have ever encountered anything like this.
