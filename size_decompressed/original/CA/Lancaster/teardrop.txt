diamond shaped craft observed near interstate making low level passes;2007-02-10 20:45:00;3 minutes;diamond shaped craft observed near interstate making low level passes I was on a week long trip to Lancaster, CA pertaining to a real estate transaction when on Saturday, this past weekend, just the evening before my departure back to Florida, I along with a passenger while driving a 4x4 rented Jeep observed a triangular/teardrop shaped craft making repeated low level moderate speed passes over the desert lanscape along SR 138 at or near 190th street West.   It was close to about 8:00 p.m. but the night was very clear and we clearly saw what was a black diamond/teardrop shape aircraft with a very low profile that made no noise.  From the side it looked like a flat flying saucer but as it banked left and right it had rounded wings that looked like a manta ray.   We did not notice a vertical tail section normally found on an airplane.  It had red and white strobe lights that clearly outlined the crafts shape.  Unlike any other craft I have seen including known stealth planes like the F-117 or B-2.  It made about 5 or more low level runs until it dissapeared into the mountain ridge line NW of us and seemed headed towards Edwards AFB.   The whole event lasted about 2-3 minutes. We saw several cars pass us but I am not sure if they also saw the craft.;34.7129120689657;-118.103304214559
