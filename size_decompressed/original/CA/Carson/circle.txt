Ball flying  under jet.;2002-10-04 14:00:00;7to12 sec;Ball flying  under jet. I was going to a 2pm meeting at my job. I notice in the west sky a passenger jet, flying about 2o,000 feet. under the jet I notice what look like a steal ball flying about 1000 feet under the jet. The ball was going about the same speed as the jet. I watch them both until they were out of my sight in the west sky. The back ground was a clear blue sky.;33.8494886718748;-118.2619953125
