At, or about, 7:45p.m. PDT on October 29th, 2008 while driving south on Interstate 110 (aka: Harbor Freeway), past the Torrance Blvd. exit, and before the Carson Street exit:  I saw to my left (just to the east of the freeway, and parallel to it), also traveling southbound, a single light that traveled from that location, in a direct, straight line until it was gone from view in the direction of the L.A. Harbor/San Pedro area. I was on my return trip home from a night-school class, and was most certainly sober and of sound mind. My first thought was, “it’s a shooting star”…I’ve seen many of those. But this was only about 200-300 hundred feet above the ground…certainly less than 1,000 feet…and it went parallel to the ground not downward. My second thought was, “it’s a meteor”, due to its incredible speed. It appeared to have traveled a distance of several miles in less than a second. here was a very light, low, pre-frog haze at that time, which made the light look fuzzy and again, due to its speed, left a tremendously long light tail.  No discernable shape other than a lightbulb. It all took less than one second, to my best estimation too fast to have been the light of any normal aircraft. I do not suspect that it was any sort of “craft” but it was something very out of the ordinary, and I would like to know what it was or what caused it or if anyone else may have seen & reported it.;33.8494886718748;-118.2619953125
Strange orange/red light flying slowly across the sky with a smaller object falling off it then both disappearing.;2008-11-27 19:30:00;7 minutes;Strange orange/red light flying slowly across the sky with a smaller object falling off it then both disappearing. It happened last week during our 2008 family Thanksgiving Dinner.  My father and other family members were standing outside when my father saw the strange orange/red light traveling slowly across the sky coming towards Carson.  He had seen it twice before during the summer so he quickly called the rest of us out to witness it.  We all quickly determined it wasn't an airplane because there were other planes in the sky at that time and this had no flashing warning lights and no sound like the rest of them as it came above us.  It was just an orange/red super bright object almost like a fireball but with no noticeable flames.   It was flying higher than the other airplanes but it was larger and brighter than them in the sky.  It traveled across the sky above us and when it reached the refineries about 2 miles away it stopped and it shot down a fireball that left a streaking orange trail like a flame but there was no smoke, just the same orange/red glow like a piece of the larger object just came off.  The smaller fireball shot directly down a couple of seconds and disappeared.  The big object then flashed a few times before it also disappeared.  Some clapped while others freaked out and asked,  what was that?   My brother who was not at this family gathering had told us about this strange light he has seen often in the sky.  He has seen it numerous times since 2005 and it's always traveling across Carson and always disappearing above the refineries.  He has also seen it shoot white lights and spin then disappear.  My parents and sister have also seen it a few times before.  Now I and about 14 other family members believe!;33.8494886718748;-118.2619953125
