Silver hovering sphrere over Carson, CA.;2014-01-13 13:45:00;1 minute;Silver hovering sphrere over Carson, CA. I noticed a silver sphere in the sky, it didn't look like any type of jet or plane i've ever seen.  It was a small circle hovering in one spot, with in seconds a couple helicopters started flying towards it and then it slowly started to disappear.  It didn't appear to fly away either, it just got smaller and smaller until it disappeared.  It was so interesting to watch!;33.8494886718748;-118.2619953125

Circular craft with bluish/white light shining out horizontally over Los Angeles County CA at 1:00AM  ((anonymous report));2019-07-24 01:02:00;3-5 minutes;Circular craft with bluish/white light shining out horizontally over Los Angeles County, CA, at 1:00AM A small bright, bluish dot came up over my house as I sat in my backyard hot tub.  I stargaze out there almost every night so I am well accustomed to airplanes, helicopters, shooting stars, and satellites sightings.  At first I thought his object was simply a bright satellite as it was tracking in a smooth slow trajectory up over my house in an area of sky where I usually spot satellites as they traverse at night. It was after about 10 seconds of observation that I witnessed the small bright object pause, then continue slowly, then pause and hover again.  This told me it was definitely not a satellite and had to be a craft of some sort.  It then continued forward but made a slow S shaped squiggle of its flight path unlike any airplane, drone, or helicopter would generally execute.  It paused once more and then began to get brighter.  I realized it was descending from a much higher altitude to a lower one.  It was not quite directly over me at this point but very near vertical as far as the angle at which I had to look up.  Once it got low enough I could distinctly see it was circular and convex on the bottom, perhaps a sphere, but possibly more flattened.  Color was black or dark gray from what I could make out.  The bright light was not on the bottom but rather pointing out horizontally from one side. I was a brilliant white/bluish hue and did not flicker or blink at all as an aircraft lights might.  No sound was audible from it. I observed the object hovering at this lower altitude of roughly 750-1000 feet up for about 5 minutes. I ran inside after that point to grab my camera.  It was still present when I returned but had ascended much higher. I attempted to get a picture but it was too hard to get a clear focus as it continued to ascend and then the light faded out suddenly and it was gone. I have been stargazing for years now and have never seen something I couldn't ID as I am familiar with all kinds of aircraft, satellites, and shooting stars that frequent the night sky. This was something very different and I cannot figure out what it was other than a definite flying object with a circular profile when viewed looking up from the ground.
