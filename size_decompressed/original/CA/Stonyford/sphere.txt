neon green, round,traveled very very fast. no sound no flashing.;1990-06-08 21:00:00;20 sec.;neon green, round,traveled very very fast. no sound no flashing. MY SON WAS DRIVING ME HOME ON A 3 MILE SREATCH OF COUNTRY ROAD. I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A GREEN PINPOINT LIGHT BEHIND US. I STARTED TO ASK HIM IF HE SAW IT COMMING, AS IT WAS GETTING BIGGER FAST, SO I KNEW IT HAD TO REALLY BE MOVING AT A GOOD CLIP. I GOT DO YOU SEE..... SPOKEN, AS IT PASSED BY OUR CAR. HE SAW IT AND IT SCARED HIM SO BAD, HE WAS ALOVER THE ROAD.IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN FRONT OF US. IT WAS A MOONLESS NIGHT AND SO BLACK OUT THAT IT REALLY WAS HARD TO COMPARE THE SIZE TO ANYTHING. WE WERE SURROUNDED MY MOUNTAINS, BUT COULDN'T SEE THEIR OUTLINE. THE THING THAT WAS MIND BOGGLING, WAS THE COLOR. IT WAS A FLOURESENT GREEN, NO LIGHT WAS AROUND IT, IT WAS HARD EDGED, I GUESS. HARD TO DISCRIBE, BUT NEITHER ONE WILL FORGET IT. I CAN SEE IT AS CLEAR AS IF I SAW IT YESTERDAY.;39.3169;-122.5439
Letts Lake sighting, CA;1990-06-09 23:00:00;1:00;Letts Lake sighting, CA I was up at Letts Lake near Stonyford about ten years ago and my girlfriend and I saw this green glowing cigar shaped object floating above the trees on the ridge. It mad a few quick sharpe strange movments, then dissapeared. I read the other siting of this and had to report it. A couple of years later, I saw a meteor almost touch ground right in Stonyford.
