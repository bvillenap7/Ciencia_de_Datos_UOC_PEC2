I then blinked to make sure it was not something in my eye. Upon further inspection I noticed this spec was circular and very black. I also noticed a shadow underneath it on the surface of the moon. The moon was approximately half full and the object was moving in the middle of the illuminated area and traveled in a straight line toward the dark half. I watched it until it disappeared in the darkness and kept watch for the next hour in hopes of seeing it again but to no avail. This object would have to be hundreds of feet in diameter for me to be able to see it. So I researched Lunar orbiters and found that the biggest one was about 2 meters in diameter, which would be impossible to see. So what was it?? Has anyone else seen something similar??;32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
five shiny metallic objects bunched in tight formation;2008-11-22 12:15:00;minute;five shiny metallic objects bunched in tight formation I was in the backyard having a smoke and watching two small planes fly by the house.  One of the planes was built for a water landing.   Once they passed over head I noticed 5 small metallic circles bunched up close together.  They then moved and formed a 'V' shape and I ran inside to get my camera, when I came out they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

I've never seen anything like this before, two unidentifiable objects in roughly the same area going two different directions.;2011-06-18 17:20:00;25 minutes;I've never seen anything like this before, two unidentifiable objects in roughly the same area going two different directions. My son and I were in our driveway playing basketball.  We saw a group of hawks wafting high above our home.  My son asked me Dad, what are you staring at? That orange thing up there?  I said Yeah.  You see it too?  It was a little bit larger than the size of a pin head and circular in shape.  We watched it for a few minutes with the naked eye.   Through my binoculars it appeared to be a reddish orange color.  It was moving in an easterly direction very slowly. It was very high in the sky.   My son and I took turns looking at the object.  Then, suddenly it was gone.  We looked and looked but could not find it again.   I then spotted a small white/silver circular object close to where we last saw the other object (it was very high in the sky too).  Through the binoculars it appeared to shimmer/blinking.  It was moving in a westerly direction very slowly.   They were way too high to be standard civilian passenger jets.   I ran inside to get my video camera.  Of course, when I got back outside (30-45 seconds, tops), neither my son nor I could spot either object again.   Could they be weather balloons?   I tried to contact March AFB (a couple of hours North of San Diego), but could not get through to a live person.  So I googled how do I report a UFO and found this website.;32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
