Light spotted over Sweetwater Resivior in Spring Valley;2001-07-09 20:00:00;5 minutes;Light spotted over Sweetwater Resivior in Spring Valley It was a warm night, about 8pm. Me and a friend decided to sit outside because it was rather warm inside his apartment. We were outside for maybe 15 minutes talking and I happened to look up and something caught my attention. A dimm, yellow round light hovering in the sky about a mile and a half away. It was hovering about 100 feet in the air. When I noticed it I told my friend to look at it, I pointed at it. We both had no clue what it could be because the light was too big to be a helicopter, and we knew it wasnt an airplane. About 2 minutes after we spotted the object, we saw something very strange! The erea where the object was hovering over is a resivior (Sweetwater Resivior) which is our water supply. The object began dropping things into the resivior. The objects it was dropping fell very slowly and illuminated with many different colors. Rainbow colored objects. It was unbelievable. I couldnt determine the size of the illuminating objects, but they seemed to sparkle as they fell. On and off. After about 3 munutes of dropping things into the water, it vanished. The light was gone. It didnt fly away, just vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I saw what appeared at first to be the planet mars or Jupiter.  I saw an orange orb low to the horizon it appeared to be spinning or revolving.  I watched it for approximately 15 seconds before it shot straight up and disappeared.  It looked like a an orange meteor instead of falling down it flew up.
