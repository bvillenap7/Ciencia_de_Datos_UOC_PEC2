Light seen flashing from a saucer type object over Spring Valley.;2006-06-12 21:50:00;15-25 Seconds;Light seen flashing from a saucer type object over Spring Valley. I was standing in my kitchen, looking south at the lights of Mexico when I noticed a red object sitting there, then it went away, so I moved to a different location thinking that a tree had hid it. The lights quickly came back on again starting from the left, and going to the right. I called my father at that moment, and by the time he reached the door it was gone. We went outside for about 10 mins and it never came back.;32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
Bright light following chem.trail like a road, until wind revealed a very shiny sphere.;2014-06-01 17:15:00;4 minutes;Bright light following chem.trail like a road, until wind revealed a very shinny sphere. I was swimming in the pool.  I noticed a long chem. trail in the sky right over head.  I said to my Son,  Another chem. trail.   As I was looking at it, I noticed a tiny light speck moving along with the trail of chemicals.   As the wind moved, I could clearly see a very shiny bright object.  So shiny, that the reflection of the sun, made me blink.   It came to a stop two or more times, back tracked and then headed east very slowly.  It must have came closer, because I could see clearly that it was a disk and not an aircraft.   Excited, I asked my Son to run and get our camera.  When he came back I had lost sight of it.   We both watched it for at least 4 minutes, before I asked for the camera.;32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
