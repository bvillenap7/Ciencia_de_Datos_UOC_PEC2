Fireball descending towards ground, changes trajectory, streaks away with giant tale behind;1994-01-25 17:56:00;5-7 minutes;Fireball descending towards ground, changes trajectory, streaks away with giant tale behind it was just after your dusk, traveling in a car up a very steep driveway, when I looked up I saw what appeared to be a falling star, as it descended it got bigger and bigger. I stop the car got out of the car, the object became bigger and bigger and bigger and redder and glowing and like a huge fireball, would seem to be right above me. when suddenly it stopped, change to directory, and sped off across T and away from me, and he had what appeared to be a huge tail like a comet.the tail was all different colors it was amazing, it made no sound, and then disappeared out of the skyI couldn't believe my eyes I looked around and waited for anybody or anything to make any kind of sound very quiet in the neighborhood.. Nobody saw what I saw..it should be noted that almost immediately after a rainfall began. prior to this event two weeks before at the same house maybe a week before.we were awoken.buy a huge explosion the entire house into shape and everything came o! ff the walls..we called the Sheriff's Department to report this.coincidentally there was a sheriff sitting apparently on the street doing his report when he heard the same thing, he was out investigating the noise when he was called back to his car to take the report of what he was already investigating.I know this because this is what he told us when he came to the house they brought people out they had no conclusive evidence of what that was but it was like a sonic boom or worse..I mention this because it was very weird and very unusual;32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
Red orb lights above Spring Valley CA.;1998-04-11 19:00:00;1 hour;Red orb lights above Spring Valley CA. Across the street from my house at Spring Valley Elem. School. I had went out of my drive way to go see my husband at work. Parked across the street a man was out of his car looking up in the sky. So i slowed down and stopped the car and looked up. I saw a red orb not that far up in the sky. And another one comming sideways across to it. They stayed there for at least 15 min. Then along came another one. I think it was having engine trouble, because it was so slow! They hovered there for a few min. Then they went stright up one at a time.

Fireball that looked like a flare in sky that shoots upward.;2007-04-04 20:00:00;5:00;Fireball that looked like a flare in sky that shoots upward. One fireball seen in night sky. I thought it was a flare.  However, it was moving horizontally as I drove.  Its flames whipping to one side as it went in another direction.  The fireball was reddish-orange.  I kept watching it as I drove down a hill.  Eventually, it shot up into the sky and disappeared, convincing me it was not a flare.  I have not seen anything before or since.

mysterious stationary red light stationary in Southeast, that slowly started to move, gradually gaining speed then disapering;2007-07-04 21:00:00;5 Minutes;mysterious stationary red light stationary in Southeast, that slowly started to move, gradually gaining speed then disapering While looking for fireworks displays from hill top home in Casa De Oro area {a section, more or less, of Spring Valley} Saw steady red light either stationary or moving very slowly. Looked at it through binoculars and it looked like a ball of fire burning steadily.  There were no flashing lights on it indicating a helicopter or airplane.  After a few minutes it started throbbing in light intensity at maybe 80 cycles per minute. It then started to move on after being virtually still, gaining speed then suddenly disappearing, as if it were switched off. It then reappeared a little further down range moving southeast.  Thought at first it might be a flare but it did not move like one because it would stop, change in intensity, then move on, slowly at first but rapidly gaining speed, plus it did disappear briefly and suddenly only to reappear maybe 20 seconds latter.  None of us were drinking or using any sort of drugs...size wise it had the same perspective as the planet Venus. It actually was near Venus, as well as Saturn , at one point, and separate from the two, so it was not the planet Venus as I could see both Venus and the object in question. I am super blown away that this has been reported in previous years, consecutively , on the same date.....It was very hard to Gage just how high up it was. We all saw it, it was a real anomaly.....;32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
