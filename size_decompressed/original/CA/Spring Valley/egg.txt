I was driving west bound on highway 94 near the Avocado exit, when something caught my eye in an otherwise clear sky.  What drew my attention was the reflection of sunlight off an egg-shaped metallic surface that didn't seem to be moving.   At first glance, I thought it might be an airplane or helicopter, but looking up a few more times revealed that it clearly wasn't.   Then, the object quickly disappeared before my eyes bit by bit.  Very odd. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
