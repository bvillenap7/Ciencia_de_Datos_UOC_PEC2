Strange Bright Red Object over San Diego;2007-07-04 21:05:00;10 Minor more;Strange Bright Red Object over San Diego Bright Red Flashing Object  	On the 4th of July, 2007 about seven of my friends and me experienced one red flashing object right above us. The object was moving rapidly and we in that moment knew that it could not be an airplane or helicopter. We saw this flashing red ball for about ten minutes as it moved up and down above us. It had a light so bright it illuminated where we were, and we were in the dark relaxing We kept looking at it amazed, and then as we were looking at it, it disappeared and it was gone!!! I didnâ€™t know what to do I was in shock of what I had just seen. This was a high area where it appeared, lots of people saw it and all knew it was something else, like a UFO. The object we could not see, due to the bright red light it had, but it looked almost as if it was scanning something.  Most amazing thing I have ever seen.;32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
