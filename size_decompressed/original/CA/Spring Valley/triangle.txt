I saw a triangle.;2014-12-04 18:30:00;6-7 minutes;I saw a triangle. Going from west to east, an anomalous, triangular craft streaked along the sky.  There was one red light that stayed in alignment with itself as the craft moved.  Strangely, the light was never the lead of a craft.  As well, it never lost shape, as all angles were, too, maintained.   As it went by I tried to get any kind of reference point, a star, perhaps.  It crosses a star and is, noticeably, translucent.   After it left the area, there was a heavy number of helicopters, like police choppers.;32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
