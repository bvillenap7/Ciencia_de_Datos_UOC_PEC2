red light over Tijuana Mexico viewed from Spring Valley;1994-10-31 18:00:00;45 minutes;red light over Tijuana Mexico viewed from Spring Valley It was early dusk halloween when my daughter (4.5 years old) at the time noticed a bright red light cruising in a westerly fashion in the southern sky.  She had called me downstairs to witness this bright orange to reddish light.  I noticed that it was high in the sky and appeared to me to be moving slowly.  It was very peculiar to say the least.  It was so strange that even my wife who was upstairs getting my son ready for trick or treating that night came out to witness it as it sped up and moved in a straight line pattern but in an vacillating fashion.  I was surprised to see other planes move normally against the same  panoramic view of sky. Which gave me a convincing feeling upon comparison that it was not a normal flying craft.  It was hard to tell how high it was but it was certainly much higher than the airliner traffic whooshing faster than the object appeared to be moving.  Erratically this red light started to vacillate to white and then red and the end made a very steep upward climb out of our sight.;32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
Satallite/faint star-like object  does 90 degree angles, circles, and splits in two.;2001-11-17 23:05:00;till 24:00;Satallite/faint star-like object  does 90 degree angles, circles, and splits in two. Appeared to be a satallite traveling from south-east to morthwest until object made a 90 degree turn. It stopped, then backtracked. After losing sight, the object appeared back where it started from. The object appeared to move in a square shape around a star. It began to make circles and slow down, speed up, and stop repeadly. After a short period the object stopped, and there apeared to be two of the objects which began to circle each other. they then returned to a position where they terminated movement. The objects were last seen in the same position as they had terminated: at the midpoint between the seven sisters star cluster and the mid star of orion's belt. We believe the distance was far, at least satellite range, because of it's star-like appearence. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe we spoke with this witness.  He seemed quite serious-minded, and credible, to us.  PD));32.730367816092;-116.974709195402

Mysterious Red Blinking light of San Diego;2004-01-01 00:00:00;20-30min;Mysterious Red Blinking light of San Diego I was having a New Years celebration (2004) at my home. A few close friends had gathered. At the stroke of midnight we went back to light a Roman candle and some firecrackers. My yard faces north. On the hillside across from me a firework lit the sky drawing my attention up. I noticed a glowing red light, high in the sky. A first I thought it was a red flare, far away. Similar in intesity, pulsating, flickering. However, to my astonishment, It remained stationary. After several minutes I commented to my friends who looked at it with disbelief. We observed it for a few more minutes, when they exclaimed it must be a plane, or a flare that caught an updraft. Hoever to my eye it appeared far away, almost star like, however it pulsed and flickered much greater that any star I have seen. I watched for a while and grabbed my video camera. It was extremely difficult to view, except in night vision mode on my camera. It appeared to gain elevation slowly and to drift slightly to the east. after another 15min+ it flickered brightly and just dissapeared. 2 guests at my party commented they had seen the same thing a few years back, 3 of them (red lights) together in fact, even closer and to the south. I myself had seen something similar, 10 years ago over mission bay, with a yellow however I will have to make another report, I I just discovered this site.  I have read up on the reports here, and I am dying for somekind of expaination. It seems to be a common phenomena in the San Diego region, and in fact an almost identical report came from a few years back in Spring Valley, even in the sam direction. Is it possible for a flare to do this?...It is hard for me to believe. Like everyone else, I guess I just want an answer;32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
2 pulsing red lights in sky on a slow trajectory;2004-07-04 21:01:00;18.5 minutes;2 pulsing red lights in sky on a slow trajectory I was having a small BBQ at my home fo the 4th celebration. After deciding not to go view the fireworks, I was in my backyard with some friends trying to catch a sneek peek at a show several miles away. After hearing the sound of the show starting, but nnot being able to see them, I was heading in when my friend (who witnessed this phenomena this New Years with me, see report)said..look...the red light is back! I turned and noticed indeed, two perfectly red lights high in the sky directly due north. they appeared to pulse and twinkle as they moved upward in the sky. The moved slowly, alternating positions. I went for my video camera, but it was out of batteries, so I grabbed my computer controlled telescope and headed outside. I managed to get the two lights in focus and began to track them. Though the viefinder, the objects did not twinkle at all! only pure red stars...no craft was visible. They appeared to my eye outside of the atmosphere at least....after a few minutes, the batteries on my telescope failed. Unusual, as I had used it very little. So I grabbed my fully charged million candle power spotlight. I attempted to flash a signal at the light, and I believe it repeated a pattern back to be, however I can't be sure. However, the battery in the light failed as well. Possibly a coincedence..but you never know.  The lights flickered and faded away as the sounds of the local firework show began the gand finale. The whole incident occured during the time frame that every fireworks show uses here in San Diego, serving as perfect cover.;32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
Clear blue sky, light moon-shaped object appears twice into different places miles up in the sky.;2004-08-15 19:30:00;3 MINS;Clear blue sky, light moon-shaped object appears twice into different places miles up in the sky. I was laying in the pool just floating and relaxing, when an airplane flew by. I focused my attention on the airplane. And as the airplane flew by, I stared into space. There was a white circle that looked like a moon real far into the sky. I stared at it for a couple of minutes to see if it would move to see if it was an airplane far away or a jet. In 2 minutes it did not move. I sent my son in the house to get the binoculars so I could get a closer look. As soon as he handed the binoculars to me, it disappeared. I told him to set the binoculars beside the pool just incase I saw it again I would grab the binoculars. We were just talking about the object so I forgot to look back at it again. I looked a different direction miles away in the sky & the object appeard again, I told my son to give me the binoculars & as soon as he handed them to me it disappeard again. It was the same shape,the same dot,the same light,in a different place. It was a clear day with not a cloud in sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

At approximately 20 seconds after midnight on 01/01/2009, my husband a retired laborer, a neighbor (a retired industrial engineer) and myself (an administrative assistant, all in our early to mid 50's) were standing outside of our apartments to listen to the new year being celebrated around us when my husband notices a bright red light in the sky to the North West of us.   At first my husband thought it might be a planet, but I pointed out that this light was tail light red.   We stood and watched the light for between 15 to 20 minutes, the light did not move, the light fluctuated from bright to dim and back to bright at times and then suddenly just disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We are not aware of any bright and prominent celestial bodies in the northwest sky, at the time the witness indicates in her report.  Object remains unidentified.

White ball of light crosses sky above and changes direction;2009-01-16 00:00:00;2:00 min.;White ball of light crosses sky above and changes direction White ball of light crossed the sky heading east and then north east during the twilight hours (more day than night). Thought it was maybe a craft or satellite, but no FAA blinking lights and the object changed direction. Additionally, the light of the object did not dim or get brighter as the object came toward me and away from me. The objects flight was smooth and had a consistant speed.

Three bright red lights in a straight line formation;2010-01-01 00:01:00;10:00;Three bright red lights in a straight line formation Three fairly bright red lights in a straight line. Lights moved southward very slowly in perfect formation. after about ten minutes, the center light dimmed slightely and appeared to desecend very slowly. one minute later all three lights dissapeared instantly.  At first we thought it may have been a blimp, but the change inb formation and decent of the center light made it obvious that it was an unidentified object.  During the last five minutes of the lights appearance, we had been flashing a 2M candle spotlight directly at the undentified object.

What looked like the point of this had a bright light that seemed to be helping another craft trailing behind it. I saw a smaller or mayber third aircraft between the two. I believe one crashed (unknown). But even as the aircrafts were out of site there was light still resonating brightly from strange cloud formation it began with.
