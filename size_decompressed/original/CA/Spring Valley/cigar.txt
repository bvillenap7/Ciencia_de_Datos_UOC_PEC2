Cigar shaped, floating, and did not move over Spring Valley CA.;2005-08-06 13:00:00;20 minutes;Cigar shaped, floating, and did not move over Spring Valley CA. The object looked long, like a cigar, black in color. It stayed in front of the clouds and never moved from what we could tell. Five photos were taken with a Sony DSC-717 using 10x Precision Digital Zoom. The first photo shows the object in full length but until looked at on computer, another object appears below it which looks like a circle or something. The second and third photo only shows the first object. The fourth photo shows the object change from a straight line to something that looks like this( ~ ), down on one end and up on the other. All photos were taken within one minute. It hung out for about twenty minutes and disappeared. The sad part is we didn't see how it dissappeared. A friend and I were trying to fix a sprinkler head and glanced up every now and then not seeing it leave. The object was sighted from Spring Valley, CA. on August 6 2005. The pictures were taken at 1:05 P.M. After observing the object for 10 minutes or so the pictures were taken. Looking at the object, it was pointing in a southwest by northwest direction and remaining still as we watched it from the north. It appeared to be hovering at approximately 1000-2000 feet it was hard to tell due to the lack of comparison against another object at a fixed altitude. It was definitely at an altitude too high to be a kite.;32.730367816092;-116.974709195402
