Yellow orb, no noise, disappered after 2 minutes.;2009-10-26 20:45:00;lees than 2 minutes;Yellow orb, no noise, disappered after 2 minutes. Yellow orb in western sky. No “aircraft running lights” (green, red, or white). Partly cloudy, but light was between clouds and us. Was moving fairly fast, left no “trail”. No aircraft type noise. Traveled from north to south for less than (2) minutes, then simply disappeared. Did not fade, or grow dimmer. It was there, and then it was gone. We do live close to a local airport, and can easily identify aircraft (planes, helicopters) in night sky. This was not any type of aircraft lights that we have seen before.;40.2988;-121.2278
