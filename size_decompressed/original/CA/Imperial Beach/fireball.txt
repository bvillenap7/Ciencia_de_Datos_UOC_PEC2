3 red fireball lights one after another over Imperial Beach, CA South to North along coast line.;2013-04-14 20:00:00;20 minutes;3 red fireball lights one after another over Imperial Beach, CA South to North along coast line. At approximately 8:00 pm on 4/14/13 Location: Southwest San Diego, CA. City of Imperial Beach  I and several others witnessed three objects flying in the night sky.  The weather here has been cloudy and a coastal eddy or marine layer with drizzle all day since yesterday.  At around 8:00 pm I had just gotten home with the family.  I went outside to make a phone call on the front porch facing west, when I heard a boom sound I started to speak to the person on the phone when out of nowhere a light appeared in the sky southwest of my location.  I was talking with the person on the phone when I told him I was seeing something strange in the sky.  I told him I would call back and try to film or photograph it. This First object appeared to by flying from south to north along the coast it originated over the ocean then disappeared from sight lasted approximately 5 min. The second object did the exact same thing that is when I called my neighbors to come out and see this we had no clue as what it could be.  The object followed the same path but stayed in sight a little longer than the first one than it disappeared. The third object appeared as soon as the other had disappeared originated around the same spot and flew the same path as the others but this one lasted the longest. The objects where like fireballs very bright and red in color it was absolutely amazing my dog was freaking out and still is acting weird. I took photos and video. I am hoping that someone else had to have seen this along the coast near Imperial Beach or Coronado, CA, it was a sighting that lasted a long time in the sky.  Total time of sighting approx: 20 Minutes.;32.579704;-117.115252

Standing outside under a clear sky and saw a bright orange round shaped object moving across the sky from east to north west.  It was not blinking but moved steadily across the sky like at the height and speed of an airplane but was the color of a fireball and completely silent.  It went straight in the one direction and then slowly faded and then disappeared altogether. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD));32.579704;-117.115252
