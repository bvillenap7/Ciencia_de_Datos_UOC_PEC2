Teardrop shaped object seen flying over beach;2019-07-04 21:09:00;5 seconds;Teardrop shaped object seen flying over beach I was watching a fireworks display at the imperial beach pier, as the sky lit up from the fireworks I saw a teardrop shaped craft flying horizontal towards the ocean. The object could have been oval or circular with an air stream behind it but I am not sure. I pointed to it and said what is that? a person next to me said I saw it too it looked like a falling star but it wasn't going downward, just straight across the sky. After it passed for about 5 seconds it disappeared;32.579704;-117.115252
