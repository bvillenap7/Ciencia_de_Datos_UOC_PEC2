As i looked over the dune toward the ocean I could see (but heard no sound) a craft that resembled a helicopter.  The cockpit area was lit in a yellowish light and I could see a pilot in the cockpit wearing an oxygen mask.  It hovered a while and then flew off over the ocean.  I had to walk back the 4 or 5 blocks to my apt not knowing how I got there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));32.579704;-117.115252
Flashing/bright star.;2014-09-10 00:00:00;All night;Flashing/bright star. It is as though it seems it would be a star, but i have never seen a star like this in my life.  It grows brighter, while almost as if it is flashing, then it turns into a dimmer flash, and then grows brighter and flashes more intensively.  I dont know if it is a weather balloon or or a satellite.  I cannot find anything on the web about this light/star that burns/flashes.;32.579704;-117.115252
