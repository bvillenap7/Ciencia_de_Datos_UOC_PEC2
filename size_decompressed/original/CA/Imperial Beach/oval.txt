I was looking up at the sky when I noticed 2 Con-Trails from a commercial jet that appeared to come from the Northwest and climbing in a Southeasterly direction.  I presumed that it was a flight leaving San Diego Airport, Lindberg Field. During this time my eyes tracked the Con-Trail for maybe 1 or 2 minutes. While I was observing the Con-Trail, suddenly another object, very bright and oval in shape, which I did not recognize, i.e. UFO appeared much closer to me than the jet which I had been observing, many miles closer in my estimation, it was coming from the Northeast, flew directly overhead at a great rate of speed and disappeared out of sight going Southwest.  The distance it traveled from first sighting in the Northeast to last sighting in the Southwest was less than 10 seconds.  The UFO was about the size of a Quarter from my vantage point.  I could not estimate itâ€™s altitude and it had no Con-Trail.;32.579704;-117.115252
