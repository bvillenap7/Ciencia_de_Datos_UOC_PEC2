It was flying from the North to South and was completely silent. I followed it until the lights split up in 5 diferent directions.  We live pretty close to a military landing field where helicopters take off and land all day. This evening was no different, but what we did notice were search lights on all night after the incident. Don't know if this was related to what I saw, but i do know that the lights are usually not on, in fact this was the first we those search lights there.
