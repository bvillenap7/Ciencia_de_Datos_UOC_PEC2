Two pulsating lights changing from white to blue to red  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of star, Sirius.  PD));2005-02-01 18:30:00;3hours;Two pulsating lights changing from white to blue to red Grilling in the backyard about an hour after sunset on the horizon looking east we noticed a pulsating light changing from white to blue to red almost like a older type police car siren light. We noticed another one north east about the same altitude, at first I thought it was a illusion from the gases in the atmosphere and decided to wait  an hour and see if it was a star or plane, an hour later they were almost over head both at their same distance apart. the next clear night the exact same thing occurred again and again a neighbor told me that they are pulsars and another said they are satellites. But now I have the whole street looking at them on every clear night. I recently went to Long Island , New York and I could see them there as well. Again on a clear night if you look east an hour after sunset about 20 degrees up from the horizon you'll see them one N.E. and one S.E.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of star, Sirius.
