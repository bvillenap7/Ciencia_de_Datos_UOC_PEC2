Unexplainable shinny chrome globe following me near Temecula;2000-08-01 11:00:00;2 hours;Unexplainable shinny chrome globe following me near Temecula I was land surveying a vacant lot in the hills behind Temecula California. Halfway through the survey I noticed a small shinny chrome colored globe about 18 across floating  about 10' off the ground in the canyon. I at first figured it was a helium balloon. I kept working, but the globe wasn't blowing away in the breeze, and seemed always to be floating within site. I kept looking at it thinking I would see seams or some resemblance of a balloon or manufacturing, but the globe looked seamless. It stayed a distance of about 200' from me as I moved along the property finishing my survey of the lot. Before I packed up my gear I decided to go have a closer look because I was getting the creeps from this thing. The globe rised up about 3-400' off the ground when I walked towards it, then floated off to the West away from me until it was out of sight. I never got the close look I hoped for to ease my mind, but as I drove home I thought about it all day. A helium balloon can be round and chrome colored, but only from two angles (front and back). If the object was a balloon, it would have had seams and/or the fill spout off the bottom. The fact that it didn't appear to have a fill spout and always seemed perfectly round the whole sighting time just didn't allow me to accept it as a balloon. The fact that it flew off to the West towards Temecula also didn't make sense since the breeze was blowing in the opposite direction. I reported the event to my office workers when I returned back to my Nevada office but everyone just blew it off. This event has haunted me for 20 years, and I still can't explain the event no matter how much I think about it. I didn't see it until I started transmitting for RTK gps surveying, it didn't leave until my equipment was powered down. It was just too strange and unexplainable.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Bright circular light that left a glowing tail with the object moving straight up and then hanging for moments before disappearing.;2002-10-14 19:00:00;00:02;Bright circular light that left a glowing tail with the object moving straight up and then hanging for moments before disappearing. We initially saw what appeared to be a falling star but it was moving straight up into the sky leaving a very bright tail behind.  At the head was a very bright cirlular object with a very long, bright tail trailing behind.  My wife thought it looked like a rocket and I thought it looked like a shooting star.  It was partly cloudy and the tail grew and then it seemed to suspend in the air and then just disappeared and left behind a glowing trail.  Then it was gone as if it wasn't there at all.   I checked the Camp Pendleton website to see if there were any reported military activities from the base which is on the other side of the Santa Rosa Mountains from where we saw the lights and nothing was being reported as being planned for this day.  I am a graduate of a California State University with an MBA in Finance, am employed and married with three children. ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD));33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Huge submarine shaped craft in the sky in Temecula 300 yards wide.;2002-10-20 21:30:00;3 minutes;Huge submarine shaped craft in the sky in Temecula 300 yards wide. I was driving north on Ynez road at around 9:30pm to get some food. From the east appeared two lights spaced from eachother. At first i thought maybe it was two planes flying next to eachother as it got closer the object looked like a giant submarine it then turned north. I went north filled with curiosity about this object and turned right on some road in a comercial area eventualy the object was directly above. Other cars in the area were all driving slow and gazing on up at the sky. I then found the object getting closer and closer above me i looked up and the object was giant probably around 300 yards it was all i could see above me naturaly this is when my fear set in. I then turned a u turned and the object continued north. During this whole event i heard a deep low frequency rumbling noise. After the object left my site i returned home and called my friend. The next day went by and we decided to go out and look for it again. We went out a little later then i had the night before and we saw lights off in the west. Shooting from one area to another with great speed. He then became very excited we drove around the area for two hours but failed to see anything else besides that first initial light. We will be back tomorrow night around the same time with a camera to see what we can. This is the weirdest and possibly the most terrifying/exciting event of my life.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788

Southern California Bright Light/ UFO? Early Morning.;2009-05-09 04:00:00;3 -4 hours;Southern California Bright Light/ UFO?  Early Morning. It was about 4 am when I was woken from my brother in law asking for the camera.  He said look outside the window there's lights in the sky.  So I glanced out of the window to see to bright lights sitting completely still in the sky.  There were no other stars seen and this was the first time I've every seen anything like this.  My mom in law said they went out there 30 minutes to an hour early and it got real close and had blue lights flashing on the top of the white light.  I was too scared to go outside to take picture because it was still dark.  I was looking out the window and saw the top light drop and smaller light which fell slowly down and disappeared.   I have pictures of this lights in the sky that were taken around 5am.  I could only describe them as lights that grew dimmer and dimmer and moved ever so slightly as the sun came through. At 5:45 they disappeared.  I will be out there tomorrow night to see if they come back.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788

The lights were moving from side to side in a row.  I know most people driving down the hill that evening saw it as many were braking.  Don't know what it was but it was very visable.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788

Saw A Circular Shiny Object Or Disk In The Sky;2013-08-18 19:30:00;~20 seconds;Saw A Circular Shiny Object Or Disk In The Sky On August 18th, 2013, at approx. 7:30 pm, I was driving to Temecula, CA, from the San Marcos, CA, area.  It was still clear daylight at that time and the sky was clearly, clearly visible, a beautiful blue sky.  I was on I-15 coming from the south and traveling northward towards Temecula.  To help pinpoint my location in travel at that time, it would have been closest to the next exit off of I-15, which was the Temecula Parkway exit on the right. At that point in my travel, I was looking skyward as I was kind of up on a hill which heads downward into the Murrieta and Temecula areas, so I was higher up on the freeway, the hill, at that point.    All of a sudden I saw a silver, exactly round, shiny disk, high in the sky, very high up in the sky in the distance in front of me.  The silver disk was stationary, no movement at all at any time while I was watching it, which was about twenty seconds, I'd guess.  It was clearly visible the whole time. It was high up in the sky, like about as high as the commercial airlines fly, but could have been higher.  It looked smaller than the moon, in comparison to that.  I at first kind of thought it looked like a very, very small moon, but it was shiny, which looked odd to me, so I kept looking at it.  I’m thinking it must have been seen by many people, as it could clearly visibly be seen. Then, all of a sudden, all I could see of the round silver disk was about half of it and it kind of looked sideways then, in that kind of way.  I’m guessing it must have quickly turned sideways (and I’m just guessing that) and it was gone!  It just disappeared out of sight.  That quickly, it was gone!  As I said previously, I didn’t see any movement of the object at any time, whatsoever, and I had constant clear view of it from my front car windshield the whole time until it disappeared.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788

3 rust colored lights dog-fighting with a possible commercial airliner.;2014-07-25 22:45:00;3-5 minutes;3 rust colored lights dog fighting with a possible commercial airliner At about 9:45 p.m., I went out front of my house to have a cigarette.  I looked north towards my neighbor's house and noticed bright orange-rust colored lights, possibly over Corona, California.   I wear glasses to correct my vision so I took off my glasses to make sure it wasn't an optical illusion on my lenses.  The lights were still there.   I put my glasses back on and watched as 3 orange lights danced around what looked like a commercial airliner.  I could tell it was an airliner because of the red and white strobe lights and the slow movement of the craft.  They looked almost like they were dog-fighting with the airliner.  They were pulling some weird maneuvers around this airliner--for instance, going very very fast and then suddenly stopping near the airliner, then moving very fast past the airliner, then stopping suddenly again and repeating the process.   The airliner looked like it made some course corrections, as if it was affected by the lights.  Then one of the rust-colored lights became more dim, and then dissipated, like it just dissolved into nothing.   The 2 remaining lights danced around as the airliner kept its original course heading approximately south-south east.   After a few more seconds of making very quick, very minute course corrections now behind the airliner, they too both dissipated into nothingness one after another.   I looked around my suburban neighborhood and noticed nobody was outside and nobody else saw this amazing dance in the sky.   I then lit my cigarette and watched the sky waiting for more but saw only stars and more planes, but they were south of my location and weren't displaying any weird movements.  I went inside and described my experience to my wife whom I abruptly woke up.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788

There was a large, gigantic white light and streak that was left behind by two rapid moving unidentified flying objects.  They were bright white lights moving as fast if not faster than a jet.  They moved to the left of the initial starting position and then parted ways, with one continuing east while the other moved south until they both slowly disappeared.  The large white light that they initially emitted stayed for at least 20 minutes after initial release. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB @ 5:26 p.m..
