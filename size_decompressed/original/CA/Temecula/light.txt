Bright lights over Pala Rd in Temecula;2002-11-05 18:47:00;4-5 minutes;Bright lights over Pala Rd in Temecula At about 6:47pm, my family and I pulled out of our drive, and turned right onto Pala road.  As we came around a bend in the road I noticed a bright red light in the sky in front of and to the right of us, at about a 1 o'clock position.  It was very big and very bright.  I commented about how big it was and asked J. if he thought it could be a satellite.  He said it was too big, he didn't know what it was.  I watched it for about a minute and a half, the time it would normally take us to get from the end our our drive, to the gas station that is a mile away.  The light was hovering stationary in the sky, and had not moved in that minute and a half I was watching.  Then it moved across the sky from a 1 o'clock to a 9 o'clock position.  I am not sure, but I believe the car in front of us was looking at it as well, because as soon as the light began to move, the person driving the car in front of us slammed on his brakes. The object moved very steadily, there was no wobble or anything like that.  It moved across the sky and then stopped and went back into a hover.  We were passing it at about that point in time.  As I caught my last glimpse of it, it appeared that there were now two red lights.  They were only red lights, no other color.  They were not blinking, like the smack lights on an aircraft would do.  For lack of better words, I would say the light was pulsating, but not blinking. The light was about as big as half of my pinky nailbed if I were to hold it at arms distance away from my eye.  That would mean either a very large object, or a very close object.  There were no sounds.  A helicopter would have made a sound. I was a helo mechaninc in the Marine Corps and I would have been able to distinguish which helo by the sound of the engine. There was no sound. The only other craft I know of that can hover like that is a Harrier, and that, too would make a very loud and distinguishable sound.  We continued on along Pala Rd and I lost sight of it once we passed the Pechanga Hotel.  I had it in my site for about 4-5 minutes. Last night I went outside after dark and watched the air traffic around the area.  There is an airport to the north of us and a military base to the south of us.  I noticed that none of the lights of the planes that were coming and going were as large as the light I saw on the 5th.  I also noted that the direction these planes were coming from were not consistent witht the flight path of the light I saw.  I would love to know what it was!;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Light turning on and off;2004-09-19 20:00:00;20 Minutes;Light turning on and off While I was out in my backyard last night between 8-9pm, sitting in my jacuzzi and looking up at the sky, I always notice shooting stars. But last night for the first time, I was looking at the sky and I saw a light turn on for one second and then turn off. I thought it was my vision even though I have perfect vision but I kept looking for it again in the same area. Within a 20 minute period, I saw the light about 7 times. It would turn on for one second, then turn off for about 3 minutes. Have you heard of anything like this? I have never seen something like this in the sky before. Could it be a stationary satellite that flashes once in a while? Looking forward to your response. The size of the light was like a bright star.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Bright ball of light that dissapears soon after being noticed. Appears almost three times a week.;2004-10-29 06:15:00;Less then 10 seconds on a;Bright ball of light that dissapears soon after being noticed. Appears almost three times a week. On my morning walks I have been spotting an unusual UFO that appears to recognize when it is noticed. It appears at different points in the sky, nearly every morning I go walking(usually every weekday from about 6am to 7am). It appears only when it is still dark out. It looks at first to be the north star, but the north star can also be seen while the object is in the sky. In actuality, it is brighter than the north star. It is motionless until noticed, upon which it immediately begins to quickly dim until the bright light is nothing but a small point of light, much like a star. After a few more seconds, it disappears altogether. The object apparently appears at different altitudes. My final sighting of it before the clocks were set back(it does not appear in daylight) occured on 10/29/04. The object appeared DIRECTLY ABOVE ME, at a very low altitude. It was extremely bright, even though it was behind the low clouds. I stood and stared at it for about five seconds, and than the stationary light, like always, shut off. The object was always completely silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Temecula light around 2005 0r 2006;2005-07-15 19:30:00;1 minute;Temecula light around 2005 0r 2006 Summer, around 2005 or 2006.  My ex husband and myself and his teenage son, and my teenage daughter (both about 17 or 18) and my 12 or 13 year old youngest daughter.  We were in our car parked on Calle Mataro Street (facing East) and a street with a cul de sac was at the driver's left.  We were in our car preparing to go the movies that night.  One kid left something in the house, so we were waiting.   \ Then one of us noticed an extremely bright light about 350 feet or so up in the sky to the left (over the houses in the left street cul de sac street.)  The light hovered, and then became extremely bright as if something was also watching us!  It hovered for about 1-2 full minutes and appeared like it was right over the roof of the homes on that cul de sac street.  We were all saying What is that?!  We all stared at it mesmerized.   After a while the light rose slowly up, and the bright light just shut off like it was never there.  My ex told us in the car not to ever mention it to anyone.  But I did a few times.  I told a co-worker, and she confided in me, when she was a kid, that her and her cousins (Riverside county) had a light shining in the living room of their cousins lake home brightly like what I had seen from the sky, and the kids and the parents seen it, and her parents shut the window quickly and told them to get down!;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Slow bright light moves across night sky over Temecula;2011-08-12 19:00:00;5 min;Slow bright light moves across night sky over Temecula My son and I just saw a strange light flying slowly across the sky.  It changed intensity several times before vanishing.  It was not blinking. I have seen satellites move across the sky before and this was much lower.  It changed direction twice but not suddenly.  It gradually hooked around 20 degrees and then straightened out again. It was so bright initially that my son noticed it through a window in the house.  He got my attention and I went outside to see it, I watched it move slowly about 5 minutes then vanish overhead.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Two very bright 'stars,', one of them red, moving slowly from south to north then fading away.;2013-07-04 21:48:00;~10 seconds;Two very bright 'stars', one of them red, moving slowly from south to north then fading away. I walked out my front door to look at the stars(my door faces south)as soon as I looked up I was confused by what I saw, two bright 'stars' that did not belong, between the constellations of Scorpio and Libra.   Their brightness was about twice that of the stars in Scorpio.  One had a red hue about the same as Antares the other had no color.   When I looked closer I saw that they were moving very slowly to the north the red one ahead of the other.   Their distance from each other was less than the spread of the three stars at the head of Scorpio.   After watching for less than ten seconds they both faded out while they were still just west of the head of Scorpio. If it was one faint light I would assume it was a circumpolar satellite passing into the Earth's shadow, but their brightness was about the same as the ISS and one of them red?  Very bizarre.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788

But then it remained stationary and would do slight hovering movements. I went back inside to watch it from my back window for a while to be very sure that it was moving and then I woke my husband.  We watched it remain still for a minute then it would drop a little and go back up and to the side.  These motions were very smooth almost like a flowing dance.  I watched it for over an hour and a half then chose to go to sleep. It had moved significantly across the sky from the original spot. It was able to do round motions.  At one point I saw an airplane cross the path of the object at a different altitude, thinking it might trigger some type of movement for the light obj! ect to leave but it did not, and it confirmed for us the difference between the movements of a plane and this object.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
On 8:25 pm a bright white light that had what appeared to be illuminated fog surrounding it flew over my house from South to North.;2020-09-29 20:25:00;15 minutes;On 8:25 pm a bright white light that had what appeared to be illuminated fog surrounding it flew over my house from South to North. The bright white light had no sound, and no discernible shape. It appeared to be at 10k feet or slightly more.  It traveled overhead until it stopped completely at a much higher altitude, and appeared to be just a bright star.  It stayed there for 5 mins, then headed back to the southeast at a very high altitude. I was able to look through binoculars at it and still couldn't determine any specific shape, but could see the fog like shroud around the light. It reminded me of a airplane with its approach lights on lighting clouds in front of it, but it was completely clear outside. My dad was a g Flight instructor and i grew up in small aircraft.   This wasnt anything conventional.  No sound, no nsvigstion lights, and ascended from 10k feet to what seemed like much higher than commercial aircraft fly (35k). Definitely the strangest thing ive seen in 44 years on this planet;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
