I was driving along the road when my friend said he saw a strange looking object in the sky, I did not see it so I made a u turn, when I did I saw the triangularly shaped object move slowly through the night sky, the object had 4 or 5 white lights on each side of it and it seemed to be a little bit blured or hazy than we lost site of the object behind some trees and did not apear again.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Brightly lit object about the size and brightness of a planet in the night sky, made several movements in multiple directions.;2008-09-24 23:00:00;1 hour;Brightly lit object about the size and brightness of a planet in the night sky, made several movements in multiple directions. The object was essentially a yellow colored light, about the size and brightness of a planet (Venus or Mars) that is normally seen in the night sky. With binoculars I could see that it appeared to be more oblong shaped with a dark band separating 2 lit areas of the object. Unfortunately it was not brightly lit enough to capture with a camera.  When my wife and I noticed it had made several erratic movements up and down and side to side, we knew it was not a celestial object of any kind. We monitored it for close to 30 mins from our backyard as it made several sudden but subtle movements back and forth and up and down. It was approx 15-25 degrees above the horizon, looking west from my position.  The erratic movements it was making were unlike any I've seen a helicopter or airplane make, especially at the distance it appeared to be. We are somewhat near March AFB, and French Valley airport, and we do get a lot of helicopter and airplane traffic overhead, but this made no noise and did not seem to move in a way I've ever seen a helicopter make. It certainly could not have been an airplane as it was too stationary.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Little triangles, and one big one with multiple lights, huge.;2011-12-30 01:00:00;5 minutes;little triangles, and one big one with multiple lights, huge. Driving home from Menifee back to Corona CA, saw small triangle with a white light at each point and red at the point, later on, continued seeing them as we headed closer to home, finally by the mountains seeing a brighter light assuming it was a plane it flew near us and up into the sky so we pulled over then seeing there were 6 white lights on the bottom and a green light on each point, the craft was huge and very visible and the littler triangles were beside it.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788

Sun glinted off a triangular shaped object going the speed of a shooting star then disappeared making no sound and leaving no trail.;2016-02-11 06:40:00;Seconds;Sun glinted off a triangular shaped object going the speed of a shooting star then disappeared making no sound and leaving no trail. Walking west on Frogs Leap Road, Temecula, CA at 6:30 am looked up to see the sun glint off a triangular shaped object streaking through the sky.  It made no noise.  Left no trail.   Lasted only a second, like a shooting star.  Too low to be an airplane.  Too shiny to be a bird. ((NUFORC Note:  Video captured by a beach camera at Doheny Park, Dana Pt., CA.  Object appears to us to be a meteor, streaking from west to east.  Please see video on NUFORC homepage.  PD));33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Triangle shaped UFO in the sky moving around!  ((anonymous report));2016-09-22 20:30:00;30 seconds;Triangle shaped UFO in the sky moving around! So I was injoying the night view and I looked at the stars and 3 stars stared moving like they were connected hints the space craft, it looked like it was flipping around and moving side to side.  It slowly got further and further away and it disappeared.  I didn't know stars could move so it has to be UFO.  I also saw 3 other stars that were flying across the sky just a little faster than a airplane.  I would see one then it would go away then another one would come by.  About a 5 min difference, I thought they were planes but you clearly tell the difference between a star and a plane!

Three star-like lights moving in the sky.;2017-03-03 21:00:00;20 seconds;Three star-like lights moving in the sky Date:  March 3, 2017.  Time:  9:00 p.m Pacific time California  Location:  Temecula, California  Duration:  20 sec  Direction:  Eastward across the sky, 3 stars that appeared to be the size of Orionâ€™s Belt in the sky appeared and weaved slightly and then disappeared.  Not out of my vision, but into the sky, as it was dark.  They also seemed to appear out of no where.  Earlier approximately 30-60 mins, I saw a shooting star, which I thought was odd given the reflective light from the city and my location. I hope that helps, I apologize if my over enthusiatisc tone made you think that this was a prank, but it is not.  Any further inquires you have regarding this situation, I would love to hear from you, via reply to this email. I appreciate what you are doing and hope more people speak up and report what they see!     Best wishes, ((name deleted));33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Object was moving faster than any aircraft I've ever seen.;2020-01-06 17:15:00;>1 minute;Object was moving faster than any aircraft I've ever seen. On Monday January 6th, my son and I were about to walk into the gym around 5:15 pm, when we saw what we thought at first was a rocket or missile launch. The object was tiny and I couldn't discern it's shape other than triangle looking with a red light on it. It came from due west and curved toward north. There were some high clouds at the time and the object was above them flying extremely rapidly, leaving a contrail. We both felt kind of nervous because of the issues with Iran and wondered if we had seen a missile launch. We live in a flyway for different military aircraft, police, traffic enforcement radar, first responders, fire fighting craft, news helicopters, commercial flights, private aircraft, and so on, in a north-south pattern mostly.  We've seen a number of rocket launches come from Vandenberg AFB, where you can see the fan like spray of the rocket's contrail and watch it move across the sky.  They move from north-west to south. This was also very ! different than other aircraft or rockets we've seen, not only because of the direction it traveled, but due to the speed in which it was moving. I can watch a jet, up at cruising speed and likely around 36,000 feet, move across the sky from horizon to horizon in about 3 minutes. This craft went across our field of vision, and just before it reached the eastern horizon, it traveled up and out of sight, taking less than a minute. It was moving faster than any aircraft I've ever seen. Location: intersection of I-15 and Temecula Valley Parkway/South Hwy 79.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
