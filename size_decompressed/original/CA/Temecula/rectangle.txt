Upon walking with a group of unkown people to our local Christmas parade route, we noticed 2 rectangular objects flying by at great speeds.  They were moving horizontally from a N to S direction at about 5000 ft.( Our best guess) The distance between us and the lights was maybe 1-2 miles and our viewing was just from the West side of the 15 Fwy looking out towards the East.  They were a hazy yellowish or orange color.  Because we live near a private airport, we are used to a lot of air traffic as well as traffic coming and going from March Airforce Base and Miramar.   Also because of the Palomar Observatory, all of our street lights are dim to allow viewing.  So because of this, we also see very clearly on almost every night meteorites coming down.  These 2 lights were going so quickly that it startled us. There was also no sound coming from them, and believe me, after spending time my whole life around military bases, nothing can fly at that speed without breaking the sound barrier and causing some kind of noise.  The only way to descibe their formation would be to illustrate it.( -_ ) Thats pretty much what they looked like.  Took about 5 seconds to across the sky and then just disappeared.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788

We drove up to a small mountain range off of Hwy 15, parked, and my wife two small kids and I were playing in the snow (a ~4 blanket of snow was on everything).  There were scattered houses in the area, each on 5-15 acres.   After about 10 minutes of playing/pictures, I was looking at the nearest house, that was about 1/4 mile away, when I noticed a rectangular blue sheet rise out of a small grove of fruit trees near the house.  The sheet appeared to be about 6' x 12' and was semi-transparent and oscillating...it looked like a thin sheet of blue fire (it moved much like fire would).  Before it cleared the tree-line, a very bright whitish flash emanated from the top and it was gone.   My wife happened to be looking in the same general direction, she saw the bright flash (but did not witness the blue sheet).  The final flash was as bright as lightning.   The entire incident was silent and lasted about 3 seconds.   I have heard of Sheet lightening but this doesn't fit the description.  This was very, very odd, out of place, and nothing like I have every seen before...it seemed out of this world.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
