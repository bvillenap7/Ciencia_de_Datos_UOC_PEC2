Did my son see a UFO that night?;2003-01-17 23:59:00;unknown;Did my son see a UFO that night? My 6 year old son told me he saw something last week after chewing on it a bit, I thought I would go ahead and report it. The exact time is unknown, so it could have happened in the late night of the 17th or the early morning hourse of the 18th. I wrote what he told me down in a journal and posted it on an internet message board. My report is just as I recorded it on paper and is as follows... My son said he was sitting up in bed looking out the window. He said he could not sleep last night because he had a dream somebody was after him. Anyways, he said he saw a jet fly by. He stuck his head up against the window to watch it as it flew over head. Then, he said he noticed another jet that he happened to spot in the light of the moon. He said it had smoke coming out of. It looked like a missle. He also said it was flying all crazy and that he didn't think the driver was paying attention. He said it looked like it flew right into the moon. He said that as he was watching it, he thought oohhh, that looks like it is going to crash. (he is repeating the story as I write this) Then he says it just crashed. He was very detailed in how he describes the crash. He said the impact looked like the sparks that come off a cigarette when somebody throws one out of the car window at night.

Low flying lights pass from horizon to horizon at approximately 1000 ft altitude in less than 4 seconds.;2003-08-14 23:30:00;4 seconds;Low flying lights pass from horizon to horizon at approximately 1000 ft altitude in less than 4 seconds. Two white lights moving in an offset tangent from West to East, approximately two to three miles North of and traveling parallel to Hwy 79 S as it traverses the Redhawk area.  Lights remained perfectly fixed in relation to one another, as attached to a single craft, or, two craft flying in precise tight formation:  Angle of offset suggests the latter.  Lights went from horizon to horizon in less than four seconds, suggesting a very high rate of speed.  No way to determine altitude, however, intuitively the craft appeared to be about 1000 ft.  This was not a helicopter, they fly overhead all the time, nor was it military jet or small jet aircraft.  There was no sound whatever.  The lights went by so quickly that I jumped to my feet from where I was sitting in bed reading.  This was unlike anything I have ever witnessed in the night sky before.  I have 25 years of military operations experience observing military aircraft conduct every conceivable maneuver at night...  I am 49 years old. ((NUFORC Note:  The objects could not have been aircraft or satellites, if they, in fact, crossed the sky in four seconds.  PD));33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
White round light moving very fast thru the nite sky over temecula,ca.;2009-12-14 04:45:00;one minute;White round light moving very fast thru the nite sky over temecula,ca. Observed a fast moving object comming from east to west,appeared to be a star or planet at first.The object was well up in the clear nite sky,the was no tail or flashing lights. Just a round white light to it.As it passed over ther were two flashes of streaking lights around it.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
High altitude light that faded into two small points of light, slowly moving in tandem to the south.;2010-08-13 03:33:00;10 - 15 seconds;High altitude light that faded into two small points of light, slowly moving in tandem to the south. I was up late watching the Perceids meteor shower with my main view towards the North East.  It was a beautiful, clear night with no moon.  Jupiter was hanging high over head and slightly to the south at this hour.  There were several nice meteors, two brilliant ones of note, but the rest were just tiny little streaks.  I was getting a little bit bored with looking at the same section of sky so I looked back over towards the South.  I could see Jupiter shining through the fabric of the sunshade but off to the side of the shade and directly overhead, I noticed a bright, smaller, pale, bluish, white light.  I was confused since I knew it wasn't another planet and I hadn't remembered seeing a star that was that bright.  As pondered this anomaly, it just slowly faded out.  While my eyes adjusted tracking around it's position, I then got this bizarre motion sensation which really bugged me out since I was sitting stationary.  I realized then that it wasn't me that! was moving, it was a tiny light that my eye had fixed upon, it was no brighter than the background stars, and it was moving slowly towards the South.   That's when I noticed it wasn't alone.  There were two distinct, small points of light moving perfectly in unison together with one ahead of the other at a slight angle from my perspective, there was a decent gap between the two, about an inch and a half to two inches if you measured between two fingers of an outstretched hand.   A jet flying at a high altitude with it's standard running lights flashing also happened to fly overhead a moment later, but towards the East at a completely perpendicular angle to the lights.  I don't think the jet's appearance was related, as I could tell it (the jet) was much, much closer that the lights.  What ever I was seeing had to be at an extremely high altitude, possibly in orbit or possibly in outer space.  I honestly don't know what I saw tonight but it just gave me the chills.  I thought, maybe it was two objects at first, but then I wondered, what! if it w as just one, extremely long object that was dimly illuminated at either end?  I've seen a few weird things in my life, but nothing like this.   Please don't think I'm crazy, I'm usually pretty skeptical about these things, but to actually see it with my own eyes...   I don't know what else to say.  I can only hope that maybe there is some rational explanation for what I've just seen.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Blacked out Helicopters followed by a strange white light;2011-11-16 20:00:00;3 or 4 minutes;Blacked out Helicopters followed by a strange white light On November 16, 2011, at approximately 18:20 hours, my witness and I were sitting in a Temecula parking lot at Ynez and Margarita in the Fresh and Easy parking lot. It was dark out. We heard several CH46 helicopters flying overhead (I am prior military, worked on these helicopters for years, I would know the sound of one anywhere).  We thought it was strange that we could hear them, but could not see the lights from any of them. I could tell they were directly over us, judging by the sound. My witness and I leaned out of our windows to visually inspect the sky above us.  We were able to spot the silhouette of three CH46 helicopters that were completely blacked out.  Those are just the ones I was able to get a visual on.  We can’t tell how many others there were that passed overhead, I just know that there were several.  They were flying unusually low.  I can’t say exactly how high up, but you figure, those helicopters do not go above 10,000 feet.  They were much lo! wer than that, though. Maybe 20 seconds after they passed overhead, we got a visual on something else in the sky.  It was round and looked like a spot light.  It pretty much resembled the spot light from another helicopter. The light was pulsating at a very slow rate and was moving through the sky in the same direction as the helicopters that had passed overhead, but was at a good distance behind and at the same altitude.      Whatever was flying over us made no sound.  We could hear the beat of the helicopters in the distance, but heard nothing overhead. After approximately 10-15 seconds of having a visual, we exited the vehicle to get a better look.  Upon exiting the vehicle, we saw the light of this craft flash on and off maybe three more times and then it disappeared completely.  No lights, no sound, no silhouette.  It was just gone.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Flashing lights in the sky.;2012-07-14 22:00:00;10-20 minutes;flashing lights in the sky   well i don't know if it was a UFO because it was cloudy. but my friends and i were driving and saw flashing in the sky. we started driving towards it, and then we saw the same thing happening on the other side of the sky.   our friend forest called us saying he heard something in the sky. and there were tons of helicopters that were flying really low with a ton of search lights.

Bright orange light, eclipsed after a minute.;2020-08-24 23:00:00;1 minute;Bright orange light, eclipsed after a minute. Initially looked like a bright orange streetlight, but was too large and high in the sky. At first the shape was semi-oval, then slowly appeared to be eclipsed by something and disappeared entirely after a minute. It seemed to stay in one spot the entire time.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
