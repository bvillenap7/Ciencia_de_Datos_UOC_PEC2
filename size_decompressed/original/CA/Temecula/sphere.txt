It was around 1:00-1:30am and night visability absolutley clear.I remember looking to my right (south) getting a few glimpses of car lights heading up a mountain several miles away when I turned to my left and saw this glowing lightstick color green orb moving slowly in front of me down the parking lot. I began to walk after it and its glow illuminated myself and the path beneath it. As I increased my pace it would distance itself. There was no sound at all.This objects approximate size was that of a softball. I know this because, it passed underneath a telephone line that was connected from building to building. Approximate height 12-15 feet and I was directly under it. The objects heading was perfectly straight and did not rise or fall in height.I followed it for a good 200 feet until it passed over a small building that was fenced off.I watched the object illuminate the building as I was backing up to keep a visual on it.The object seemed to reach the back of the building stopped and then just winked out.

Three shperes;2001-12-17 12:00:00;1 hour +-;Three shperes Around noon time as I was coming up Ynez Rd. I saw three sphere shaped objects high in the sky.  I believe they were silver, as the sun was brightly reflected off of them.  What caught my eye was that one of the spheres was making impossible movements.  It was moving back and forth in perfect swinging pendulum types movements.   It was moving very quickly like this, back and forth for some time.  I parked my car in a parkin lot on Ynez and Winchester Road and continued to watch a bit longer.  There were two other sphere shaped objects above, however, they remained stationary.  At one point, the sphere that was moving had attracted two large hawks to it.  The two birds and the sphere seemed to engage in a playful game together.  I think this is significant because comparing the sphere to the birds, I would say the sphere would be about 3 to 4 feet in diameter.  I sat and watched this for about 45 minutes total.  At 1300 hrs, I ducked my head back into my car (I had been standing outside of my car) just long enough to unbuckle my baby from his car seat.  When I got him out, and looked back into the sky, all that was left was the two birds. There were no signs of the spheres anywhere.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Blue Green and multi colored Orb  2 pix 1 filmclip;2008-07-06 22:30:00;1hr 1/2;Blue Green and multi colored Orb  2 pix 1 filmclip On 7/6/08 22:30 looking up at the stars I noticed a flashing pulsar then 3 more, I rarely saw four in a straight line east to west, so I decided to set-up my telescope celestron 130 slt with 2X Barlow lens with plossl fully coated 12.5mm and noticed they were or seemed to be rotating and flashing like a siren all type of torques colors blue green as Well as red white. called my wife out to take a look and a few friends were all equally amazed , I took 20 pics and 5 movie clips was there for a good hour and a half and then they all disappeared . I panned the skies for another hour I wanted to explain it before I went to bed couldn't find it. However I noticed a lot of what appeared to be satellites (white dots, star like) zipping across the sky in all directions it seemed every few minutes another one would cross the viewfinder path moved to quickly to see through telescope so I grabbed my binoculars some would disappear or fade out before 15* to horizon other would make it all the way assuming they continued I can only follow to about 5 degrees. Still curious I grabbed my night vision Single Scope made in Russia night Owl optics Give a pretty big view plus 10 x 35 mag. I haven’t found away to take pics through it but will come up with something what I saw was pretty amazing, I aimed into the sky ( above my head) then flipped on infrared within a minute I began seeing moving white dots (all stars look like white dots through the night vision some lager then others, lots of them) I was telling myself this must be normal a lot of debris up there.  NORAD claims to be track like 9000 pieces perhaps it was the suns reflection hitting this debris? I don’t know, will invest in a night vision camera;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
round orange sphere over the temecula valley;2011-08-21 20:30:00;1 minute approximately;round orange sphere over the temecula valley from the corner of my eye I saw what I thought was a shooting star.  When I turned to look at it, it was pretty low, close to the house it was flying over.  It was completely round in shape and a bright round red/orange glow.   It had an irredescence like a jellyfish and moved with the grace of a jellyfish pulsing like a jellyfish slightly opened at one end yet the burnt/orange color was a completely round shapeball slowly moving from a south/west direction to a north/east direction.   As it moved slowly and quietly further away and up higher it changed shape and looked like an airplane that was engulfed in flames but made no sound.  it kept travelling until it grew smaller and smaller and dissapeared.

Looking southwest we saw a light go straight up above the horizon, it moved around left to right, and seemed to be orbiting, with very rapid movements,  then it left and headed south out of sight.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
