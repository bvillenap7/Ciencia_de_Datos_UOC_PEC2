Fireball seen in Southern California;2002-10-05 18:50:00;10 Min.;Fireball seen in Southern California Mother and son and Nieghborhood children see Pink colored fireball appear to come into our atmosphere. It traveled south to north along or just off the Pacific Coast of Southern Ca. Object descended in altitude, was moving slowly across the sky, and left our viewing area to the north and west. ((NUFORC Note:  Description seems consistent with the many reports we receive of contrails behind aircraft in the western sky during a setting Sun.  Just a guess.

Red bright light flighs across the dim sky!!;2010-07-24 09:40:00;Backyard;Red bright light flighs across the dim sky!! I was in my room enjoying myself. I looked out of my window and saw a round bright red ball in the sky.  I was scared! I ran outside to my backyard. Looking around I saw it, the light was small at first, it was kind of pulsing.  It slowly went across the sky.  It drifted away getting smaller.  I grabbed my brother before it went away.  He saw it and said it was a plane.  Planes aren't that red and aren't that big! I couldn't help but remember how slow it went, as I continued looking at it, the light went faster.  Soon left out of my sight.

Seven bright, orange, round lights on New Year's Eve 2010;2010-12-31 21:00:00;3-4 minutes;Seven bright, orange, round lights on New Year's Eve 2010 My husband and I were sitting outside around the fire when, from the Northeast, we see a bright, round, orange light flying slowly towards us. Thinking it was a helicopter with an unusual orange light we just watched as it flew over our home. As it came closer we expected to hear the usual noise of a helicopter, but it was silent. As it seemed to be directly overhead, it seemed to dim and then shoot upwards to a pinpoint light and disappear. While overhead, it seemed to have the appearance of such a bright light it had a starburst look about it.  About 15-30 seconds later, another one came from the same direction and did the same thing. After about four of these bright orange light fireballs we called our son to come and witness. He saw three more of the same.  We were not under the influence at the time. I do not drink. My husband is an airline pilot and former Marine fighter pilot. He is a very logical man and was completely dumbfounded.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
Falling fireball that split into three then disapeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected parachute jumpers. PD));2011-01-06 21:45:00;5 minutes;Falling fireball that split into three then disapeared. My wife, her cousin and myself were exchanging gifts in a parking lot in Temecula, California, by the corner of Winchester Road and Ynez, facing northwest, when we noticed a streaking, bright orange fireball falling from the sky.   At first, I thought it was a falling star, then I thought it was a missile because there was a trail and it appeared to be falling slowly.  We watched the fireball split into two, than it split into three and appeared to hover over the ground for a couple of minutes.  It wasn't as bright as it originally was, and then it all disappeared.

Fireball that hovered for about an hour and changed shape;2011-07-01 19:00:00;AMOST AN HOUR;Fireball that hovered for about an hour and changed shape I already filed this with San Diego, yet I don't see it on the reports.  I have seen this type of vehicle twice now.   On May 13, 2010, and July 1st, 2011.  It looks like a bright fireball from where my house is,yet it gives off no illumination, other than flare of it.  Almost like a arc-welder.  It was out on the mountain in the back of the house.  Me, my husband, and a friend watched it for like an hour.   Then after it got dark it started flying towards me, but changed it's shape to make me believe it was an airplane, but it wasn't.   I know what I saw, it wasn't from this world. I have the full video of it (almost an hour), and I also have still captures from the video to show you this fireball phenomenon...it's very strange, and all I want to know is what is it!!;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
