Huge bright blue flying object seen low in the sky in Southern California;2020-07-21 21:50:00;20 seconds;Huge bright blue flying object seen low in the sky in Southern California A very bright blue ball caught my peripheral vision while in my backyard late this night, and it was moving in a western/downward trajectory what seemed not terribly high in the night sky.

It was a bright white-blue color, with a small trail behind it.
