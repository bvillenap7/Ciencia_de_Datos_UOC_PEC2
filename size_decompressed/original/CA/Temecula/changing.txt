Big, Bright Hovering Light;2010-05-14 00:48:00;10- 15 MINS.;Big, Bright Hovering Light I took my dogs out to go to the bathroom before I went to bed around 12:45 am on May 14th.  When I went out the back, I saw a very bright light or star-like object off out in the distance, but it started coming closer and getting brighter and brighter.   I called to my boyfriend and told  him to come look at it, to see if it was some sort of helicopter or an airplane.  There were no blinking lights, no sounds, and when it got close enough it just hovered in the same area for awhile, slowing moving to the right, or getting higher and then lower. I grabbed my camcorder and started recording it and at first it was a sphere and then it changed into a diamond shape when I would zoom in.  We both stood there trying to figure out what it was, he would look at it, then I would through the lens of the camera or binoculars but we couldn't figure it out. As I said, it made no sounds, no blinking red or green lights it just shown like a big bright light for a time. It lit up the area around, sort of like how a full moon lights up the sky, and after awhile of watching it we both just came in and didn't bother trying to figure it out anymore, and later on I checked and it was gone. What's  so strange is a friend of mine had seen it to, and when I was telling her and showing her the video I took, she said, Oh my god, I saw that same thing this morning! and a friend of mines son also seen it around the same time but in different places.   I look up to where it was just about every night, trying to see if it was some sort of light or house but there is nothing… I think it was something though, but not from our world.

Giant fire balls in the sky.;2014-06-26 22:45:00;40 minutes;Giant fire balls in the sky. We saw giant fire balls in the sky, it started off as three in a triangle formation then they changed into linear formation, then they disappeared and re-appeared several times during 30 minutes.  The number of fire balls increased then decreased but at the end it went from 5 at the most to more than we could count.  The large amount of fire balls were visible for att least 10 minutes so 40 minutes total, approximately.  When filming and photographing the balls they looked like blinking lights.  We were at least a 45 minute drive away from them but they were still very large and visible, we are about 3500 ft above sea level and they were still way above us.  I have numerous photos and three videos.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
An object appearing to be shaped of multiple bright circles within it.;2020-10-17 03:20:00;Presently there;An object appearing to be shaped of multiple bright circles within it. Around 3:20 a.m. my husband & I both witnessed what looked like a star, only we both agreed it was too close to the earth to be a star.  I awoke to the sound of a helicopter, in which flew in the direction of the object yet underneath it.  I ran downstairs to grab our binoculars from the garage to take a closer look. As I adjusted the binoculars I could clearly see a multiple of circles within this object that looked to be some sort of spaceship looking object or flying saucer.  My body immediately developed goose bumps I almost dropped the binoculars! I could not believe what I was looking at, so I looked again and woke my husband up and convinced him to look too.  My husband described the same thing without my having given him a description of what I’d seen. After contemplating whether we should phone the police (in fear of being laughed at or thought to be crazy) I decided it was my duty to report it.  I thought also that maybe the helicopter was also surveying it.  The police advised me to contact the UFO Center. I phoned and left a message of what we’d seen with the National UFO Reporting Center in Washington.  I hope this report helps.;33.5103805845512;-117.120729018788
