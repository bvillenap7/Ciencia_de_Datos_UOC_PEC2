A very bright red light appears and disapears in three minutes after just  huvering in the sky.;2003-08-24 00:12:00;3 minutes;A very bright red light appears and disapears in three minutes after just  huvering in the sky. My son asked my brother to borrow his binnoculors because he heard mars was near by. So my brother got them for him so we all were looking up in the sky suddenly my son said, dad look at that red light is that mars? he  said, so everybody looked up again and there it was a bright red object as high as some of the stars. It appeared to just sit there so we were all wondering what it could be. I got the binnoculars to take a lil closser look and it was bright red,half around the circle was more red lights aroun the object there had to be at least 20 lights but the same color as the object. all of a sudden it faded a bit and finally it disapeard as if it was sucked up into space. I called various news stations to see if they had any other calls on this but they all said oh its just mars. I know and everyone else knows that this can not be a planet. Planets dont just get sucked up into space the way we wittnessed it.;34.011;-118.1145

on sunday the 24th of august at 00:14hrs we witnessed a bright red spot in the sky as red as a stop light. It looked like a star.we all;2003-08-31 00:11:00;00:20;on sunday the 24th of august at 00:14hrs we witnessed a bright red spot in the sky as red as a stop light. It looked like a star.we all looked up and we all seen it. This star was moving slowly across the sky it lasted about 8 minutes in the sky before fading into space.Before fading into the space it started to flash a bit,then it tilted a bit and flashed some more and as ifit got sucked into space. I called a few local news stations and there response to it was that it was mars,wich we all doubted,planets dont move and just dissapear.I told my son this is the first and last time we see something like this. We gazed up into the sky for a few nights hoping to see this phenomenon once more but no luck, but this morning we saw it again at 00:12hrs this this very early sunday morning on the 31st of august 2003.Only seven days later all the same witnesses same location in the sky as if it was a replay, this time I called my sister who lives half a mile from sighting she also witnessed it. we took pictures of it,the weird thing about this was ,that when we took the picture the glare from the object would dim out with the flash of the camera it seemed like it would respond to the flash of the camera. then it flashed a few times and like the past week it was on its way. This a shock to all who seen this and we all have our own thories or opinions , the news says its a reflection from mars ,wich i think its a bunchof bull shit excuse my language.I know thats its not mars im hoping U F O. My story is true i can swear on the bible. Please if you have any clue of what this my be please E-mail me at ((e-address deleted)). plaese help us to get your opinion on this. IT is 03:28hrs pacifc time sunday the 31st of august.  THANK YOU.;34.011;-118.1145
Red ball of light over East Los Angeles;2003-09-07 00:00:00;1 hour;Red ball of light over East Los Angeles We saw a red light in the sky right above us. I t hovered above us but was floating east. The object was about as high as an airplane and looked like a star except it was deep rich redand floated. Then as it moved it began to blink and then it shot to the right and back to where it was before it began to float. It must have travled about 5,000 mile across the sky in about 1/10th of a second. Then it floated back to where it first dissapeared and began to blink again then dissapeared, and just as it did it reapeared on the other side of the sky above us. It floated back across the sky and then blinked itself out.;34.011;-118.1145

I saw a fast moving orb going southeast over Montebello before I watched it grow a tail and get brighter as it moved before disappearing.  Approximately two minutes before the fireball appeared I saw two big blue flashes in the sky within five seconds of each other.;34.011;-118.1145
