Report of fire ball hovering above a city street.;1997-06-01 18:00:00;40 seconds;Report of fire ball hovering above a city street. I was in the passenger seat of my mothers car, she was driving.  We were about 20 feet from an intersection when we both saw a ball of fire.  It wasn't moving.  It was just hovering there. My mother and I both saw it at the same time, but said nothing to each-other.   As soon as we passed it, we both looked at each other and said Did you just see that?  I turned around quick and couldn't see anything.  We made a u-turn and drove through the exact area that we saw it.  It wasn't there. This happened about 15 years ago.  I was fourteen years old and my mother was 43.  The area in which it happened was a normal city street.  It wasn't above in the clouds, afar.  It was in the midst of where we were.  I could have thrown a rock at it.  It was round.  The colors where orange, red, and yellow.  We both saw it for at least 30 seconds. I was listening to Coast To Coast and was amazed at the description of the fire ball.  So I thought I would write in and give my report. I sent some images to your email address. They are a digital rendering of what we saw and it's size.;34.011;-118.1145
Brilliant glowing red star in the sky that was no identifiable aircraft and moved before vanishing;2003-08-31 00:20:00;31;Brilliant glowing red star in the sky that was no identifiable aircraft and moved before vanishing We first noticed a very brilliant glowing red star in the southwest sky (about 60 degrees to the horizon) at about 12:20 am Sunday morning.  It was very, very high  in the sky and it was obviously not an aircraft. At first we thought it was Mars, but we later located Mars at a different location from the glowing red object.  It was stationary for almost the entire duration while we were watching it, and then it started moving northerly and then disappeared all of a sudden. It did not leave any trails in the sky but faded in and out a couple of times before disappearing.  It was extremely bright and very red. We are absolutely positive it was not an aircraft due to the apparent extreme altitude, shape, and movement.;34.011;-118.1145
Solid round flying object.;2014-06-27 02:00:00;1 seconds;Solid round flying object. While on a call for service (Police services) I was facing south on Beverly Blvd. at Poplar Ave. in the city of Montebello California.  I then observed a round illuminated object in the sky. I noticed there was two 747 type planes in the air space at the time of the incident.   For approximately one second, I observed a round illuminated object travel across the sky.  The object traveled at a high rate of speed, passing the two airplanes in air space.   The thing that made me believe this object (UFO) was not a shooting star, was the fact it had no trailing line.   It traveled alone as a solid object.  It started at a slow rate of speed and disappeared into the nearby clouds.;34.011;-118.1145
