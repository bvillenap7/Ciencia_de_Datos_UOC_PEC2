Sphere shape, red, blue and white lights, over Montebello headed north west toward ELA / Monterey Park;2007-11-12 22:45:00;4-5 minutes;Sphere shape, red, blue and white lights, over Montebello headed north west toward ELA / Monterey Park It was approximately a couple or a few hours after the Mosely vs. Cotto fight. As me and my friend were walking to my car so I can take him home. My friend spotted the object first and told me to look. At first glance I thought it was a balloon because it was round and white, it was hovering pretty low, I told him it looks like a balloon. He disagreed, As I focused in on the object the object started to move very quickly going North west towards East Los Angeles / Monterey Park area, it had blue, white and red lights, Not extremely bright but bright enough to see once your eyes have focused in on it. As the object seemed to be weightless because of the way in was moving, it was moving side to side but still on a straight path, we observed till the object faded out. We were in the area of Whittier Blvd and Montebello Blvd @ approximately 11:00 pm;34.011;-118.1145
