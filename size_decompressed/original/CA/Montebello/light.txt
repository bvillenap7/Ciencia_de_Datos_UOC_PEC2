Two to three second display of  synchronized lights travelling really fast.;1998-06-12 22:45:00;2-3 seconds;two to three second display of  synchronized lights travelling really fast. I was a passenger in the rear of a car when i saw the lights.  We were headed east on Washington Blvd and the lights were also heading east.  They were towards the north.  I observed the light in the north sky.  At first, i saw one light, green like a laser light. It was going horizontally really fast.   At first, i thought that it was a firework, but then it did something amazing.   While flying, it split into two, with the second light coming off at a perfect 45 degree angle then immediately paralleling the first light.   At the same time that the second light paralleled the first light, a third light shot out of the second light then on turn also paralleled the other two lights.  The first light was slightly ahead of the second light which was slightly ahead of the third light.   I immediately yelled at my 2 companions but it happened too fast and they didn't catch it.  I know what i saw and i don't need witnesses.   I have seen and believe. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));34.011;-118.1145
The large red light moved accross the sky, and stopped on the north side of our home.  Affter about 15 min. it just vanished.;2003-08-24 00:15:00;10 - 15 min.;The large red light moved accross the sky, and stopped on the north side of our home.  Affter about 15 min. it just vanished. My 18 year old son returned home with 4 of his friends at approximately 12:15 am, when they spotted a large red light moveing across the sky and stopping on the north side of our home.  My son came into my room and woke me up to use the camcorder to film the light.  I thought he was talking about a red light about the size of a star, but when I went out with him, the red light, it was huge and a dark red.  It appeared to be the size of maybe a red light signal, or slightly larger.  I was so amazed that I went inside to call my oldest son on the phone.  I dialed his number, and got a recording to a business that my deceased husband worked for prior to his death, in July of 1999.  I could not believe my ears, so I hung up and pressed redial and looked at the number on the display.  It was my sons number, and again the recording came on.  I let my son and daugher listen to the recording, each time pressing the redial button and looking at the displayed number.  I have never memorized his work number, nor have I called that number since 1999.  This was a shock to me, because, even if I had dialed a wrong number, what were that chances that I would get that business.  As my son continued to record this light it appeard to come closser and then it went further out, pulsed a few times and then just dissapeared.  We all went inside to see what was filmed on tv.  At approximately 12:40 am, I called channel 11 news, tip desk.  I told them what we had seen, and the gentlemen informed me that there were 3 other calls out of Motebello reporting the same red light.  I told him that we had footage, and he took my information and said that someone would call us in the morning.  By noon on Aug. 24th, we still had not heard from channel 11, so I called channel 5, who suggested that we take the tape to the studio so that they could make a copy of it.  The gentleman that spoke to my son, told him that it was probbably mars, but after reviewing and copying the tape, he said that it was not mars, labled the t! ape UFO and told my son that they would call him if they used it.  We have not heard from them to date.  I still have the origenal tape, except that I inadvertently tape over a small portion of it, however the beginging of the filming and the ending where it dissapears is still in tack.;34.011;-118.1145
Bright red light in the skies over Los Angeles - stationary at first, then blinking in morse-code;2003-08-28 23:00:00;About 1 hour;Bright red light in the skies over Los Angeles - stationary at first, then blinking in morse-code Approximatey 11pm I noticed a bright red dot in the sky. The sky was completley clear. This dot looked about the same distance and same size as the stars around it only it was bright red.  It did not move or flicker.  It stayed stationary for about 40 minutes when it started to blink in a morse-code fashion.  It would periodically fade in and out, until finally, it faded out all together.  There were approximatley 20 witness to this activity.  It was not a natural occurance.  This was something extrs-terrestiral. ((NUFORC Note:  The description of the object is not inconsistent with that of a twinkling star, we observe.  However, we do not know what the witnesses observed.  PD));34.011;-118.1145

We saw only one at first then a second one joined it, but that one was farther away from the first,and when second light appeared the original light disappeared.The second light faded after roughly 15-20 minutes after the original light had left. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been observing celestial bodies, but that is only a guess.  PD));34.011;-118.1145

I watched it for 10 minutes, it tracked a little to the north-west, began blinking and dissapeared.   About a half hour later, I saw the same bright red light to the east or south east.   It was lower in the horizon, moved very slowly in a north-westerly direction, hovered for a while, blinked intermittantly and the lights went out. I video taped it.  I do not believe in UFO's.  This could easily have been a man made object - it was just very strange for a number of reasons:  The bright red light, It hovered in the same place and made no noise, the blinking of the light seemed random.;34.011;-118.1145
Looked up at the sky and immediately noticed all the traffic high in the sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-14 04:00:00;4:00 to 5:00;Looked up at the sky and immediately noticed all the traffic high in the sky. There were many light orbs I counted over 50 only in the time I noticed it. They were all going in the same direction south east . They were traveling very fast and they at times waited for each other . I searched for there origin and that's when I noticed a much larger orb about 3 of them that appeared to be shooting them out. Even saw a dual for ation right before sunrise.;34.011;-118.1145

I saw 10 at a time and they kept coming and coming for several minutes.  I saw one traveling at an extremely high rate of speed and I lost sight of the object within seconds.;34.011;-118.1145
