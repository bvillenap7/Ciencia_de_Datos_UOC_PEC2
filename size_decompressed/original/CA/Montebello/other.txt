Airplanes make their turns in this area and you can always hear them because their so low but not what we saw. It was moving at a steady speed, stoped then disapeared. I wasn't a believer till now. I called my buddy up a few days later and asked him if we were crazy and he said no because that was fact that they do exsist. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

A sighting that was out of the ordinary, but not extraordinary.;2006-10-01 02:20:00;5 Min;A sighting that was out of the ordinary, but not extraordinary. I was driving down a street at 2:20AM near my home and a light caught my eye.  I slowed down and thought I was looking at a police helicopter with a light they use to shine down onto the ground, but it was not shining onto the ground. Then I realized that the light was not contained in a spot light, it was more like a yellow hued flood light that shined really brightly then got smaller, but still as bright, then back to very large and bright then down to nothing. The Object is best described as an elongated helicopter or airplane but it lacked the little flashing red and blue lights that I've seen on every aircraft. This object did however have small windows that would have been similar to a plane, but weren't lit up the whole time.  I rolled down my window to hear the engine thinking that would help me figure out what it was and there was no sound of any engine, but the object was close enough and low enough that an engine should have been heard. The object was flying very low off the ground so I doubt it was a plane. The object stayed stationary for about a minute, continued towards downtown LA, then paused again and continued without any visible lights. Then the object eventually faded into the distance and was no long visible. This sighting was not a crazy light show of any sorts or like any other sightings I've read about in the past half hour. What I saw just out of the ordinary, but not extraordinary.;34.011;-118.1145
