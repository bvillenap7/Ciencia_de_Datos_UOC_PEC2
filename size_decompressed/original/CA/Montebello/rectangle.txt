Was walking east to west carrying my sleeping daughter and I just happened to look up to the west towards downtown Los Angeles And there was a huge rectangular object I could say vertically on top of East Los angeles, I thought the fog was covering the moon but the stars behind it were visible and even some at low altitude. I can only describe its size as possibly as both twin towers put together in height and length. It was not glowing, it seen it was only reflecting the lights of the city so it looked pale in color. I walked in the to house to put my daughter to bed and to get a camera but when I came back out it was gone;34.011;-118.1145
