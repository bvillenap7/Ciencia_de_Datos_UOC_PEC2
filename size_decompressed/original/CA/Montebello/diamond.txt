looking at Mars;2003-08-23 23:00:00;10 minutes;looking at Mars As looked up to stare at mars, I looked to my left the first sighting  at 11:45 which appeared to be a red light hoovering over montebello/East Los Angeles area at least by the naked eye, I immediately called home so my family could come outside and take look my younger brother went to get the bonaculars, Myself and others around me seen two aircrafts other than the space-ship fly directly towards the space-ship at high speeds. The two air crafts were there for about two min and then left and the space-ship also faded away. Now around 12:30 as I was leaving a friend's house i was looking up at the sky the space-ship appeared again by this time i was somewhat prepared with a camera, so i took three pictures, now my younger brother had the bonaculars said he seen a diamond shap object which my sister and mother also saw through the bonaculars it then faded away for the last time.;34.011;-118.1145
