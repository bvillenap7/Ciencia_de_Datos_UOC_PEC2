It was low on the horizon, so low that it wasn't visible at times behind the trees.  it travelled fast, but slower than an airplane, from East to West.  I estimated it to be over Interstate Hwy. 10 or a few miles N. of it.  I saw it first from my residence for a few seconds, then behind trees, then visible again.  I drove to Country Club Drive and saw the glowing object heading west, becoming smaller and smaller, until the glow disappeared.  It was shaped like a flattened football, and appeared quite large.;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
