One moving disk in flight while second disk also moving in front of hillside. ((NUFORC Note:  Bird with wings folded, we believe.  PD));2011-07-05 05:59:00;I don't know;One moving disk in flight while second disk also moving in front of hillside. I was taking pictures of the surroundings to give to a friend of ours because he is trying to decide whether to come to visit us here in Palm Desert or to go somewhere else.  I did not notice the crafts at that time but when I when to go over them 3 hours later.  There are two crafts in the picture. One in front of the mountain and the other one above the mountain.  The crafts are in the upper left quadrant of the pic. There was no sound or anything.  No one lives around there since the land is part of Indian Land Management.  I will include two pictures.  One with the objects and one taken right after, after I moved to reposition myself.  Please keep in mind I did not see anything when I took the picture.  It was only about 3 hours later that I noticed. ((NUFORC Note:  Bird with wings folded, we believe.  PD));33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
