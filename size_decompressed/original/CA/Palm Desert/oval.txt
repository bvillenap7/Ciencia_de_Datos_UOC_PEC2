Number flying craft above in Palm Desert;2013-09-03 21:00:00;20 minutes;Number flying craft above in Palm Desert We noticed lights that were too low and bright to be satellites but definitely not planes as they did not have any blinking lights to them.  We could also clearly see planes every now and then to determine the difference.   At first they appeared to be following the same path but not too close behind one another.  There were at least ten that flew over maybe more.   We went to the front of the house where it was darker and saw a few more flying in other directions.  Never seen anything like this.  It looked like bright stars were moving but again not like satellites that are normally faint and higher up.;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
Two oval objects heading fast towards the west over Palm Desert.;2015-12-12 09:00:00;3 minutes;Two oval objects heading fast towards the west over Palm Desert. Driving west on Fred Waring in Palm Desert,  I saw two disk-shaped objects in the clear sky.  They were headed relatively fast towards west, seemed to be quite high up in the air, and I couldn’t hear any sound.  (I was in a car so that may have been the reason.)  The two objects were close to each other and kept the same distance and configuration.  They were both identical in appearance:  Oval, dark in color, somewhat metallic looking.  At the time, I and the driver of the car had no idea what they may be.  They didn’t look like anything I had seen before, and I couldn’t think of anything known they could be.  They went too fast for being a balloon.  They were definitely not birds.  It was daylight so they were not obviously planets or meteors.  They were not civilian drones since they went fast and continued over the mountains.  They did not have the shape of any airplane I have seen. Thinking back now, it is possible that they were two helicopters and we didn’t see the rotors or any of the things normally protruding from helicopters.  It’s possible, but it does seem unlikely that we wouldn’t have seen any of those things and the perfect oval shape of both objects didn’t fit the shape of helicopters I have seen.  It is possible that they were military drones flying in perfect formation and with no visible or audible form of propulsion.  I don’t know if military drones comes in a perfectly oval shape.  It was certainly an odd sight. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter  I am sorry, it was approximately 9am. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
Two bright circles coming out of a bright cloud.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2017-12-22 17:32:00;5 minutes;Two bright circles coming out of a bright cloud. Saw a really bright light outside my house. I went outside to investigate and in the sky was a bright glowing cloud.  Flying away from the cloud were two glowing objects. They were travelling in the same direction, but the trailing one was emitting light that pulsed out in semi circles behind it. They both seemed to be emitting light, like shining fog. The leading circle was faster and continued to the south, the trailing light turned and went south west. I took photos and video. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.
