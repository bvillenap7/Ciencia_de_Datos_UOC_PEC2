Reddish/Orange Top shaped flashing spacecraft 12-31-13, Palm Desert, CA.;2013-12-31 21:15:00;10 minutes;Reddish/Orange &quotTop&quot shaped flashing spacecraft 12-31-13, Palm Desert, CA I heard fireworks around 9:00PM, and went ouside to see them.  Too far away, not high enough and obstructed view, I was unable to see fireworks.  So since I was out there I looked up to see the stars and saw red/orange flashing lights in the shape of a top.  At arms length it was the size of a quarter.  As I watched it move, I ruled out that it was a plane, helicopter or blimp, as it changed direction spontaneously.  It was so mesmerizing to witness something that my mind could not logically comprehend.  When I decided it was a UFO it darted to the east, then vanished without a trace.  There was no smoke or sound, but I kept looking to watch it reappear. it never did.  And then I basically thought that I was crazy!  No, not really! I felt so lucky to see the same activity so many others saw around the world! 12-31-13 9:15PM PST.   I saw an actual UFO!  I'd like to volunteer to go up on that spacecraft!;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
