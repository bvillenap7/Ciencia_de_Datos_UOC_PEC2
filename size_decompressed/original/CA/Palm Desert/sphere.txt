Red orb/ ufo palm desert, ca;2013-01-01 00:30:00;1 minute;Red orb/ ufo palm desert, ca After a New Year's Eve party as my girlfriend and I were leaving we saw a red orb in the sky. I was going to take a picture and it disappeared or vanished.   This is the second red orb I've seen in my life.  The last one was when I was in a plane.  It was a far distance but same level as the plane. Then it went up towards like space with a smaller white orb following it. Then came back down just the red orb again same level as the plane and stopped.   It then hovered over a cloud and it like stopped glowing red.  But the clouds were dark because it seem it was raining then there was lighting and it brightened up like glowing.  Will never foget that;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113

I’ll never forget how it looked thru the binoculars, what an amazing experience;2020-07-31 12:00:00;2 hrs;I’ll never forget how it looked thru the binoculars, what an amazing experience I have pictures and videos.  We live in the Coachella Valley, a friend first spotted in Desert Hot Springs, then another friend spotted it in La Quinta and we see it now in Palm Desert. We are a small valley.  It just hoovered in one spot only moving up down, to the right and left in small spurts.  It’s been two hours now and it’s still hoovering.  We’re trying to drive closer to it because we think it is hoovering over our Palm Springs airport.  When we looked at it thru binoculars it looked like a white glowing orb, I mean perfectly round , the best thing I could describe it to is as if it were a tiny little moon.  Clear blue skies out only a couple clouds at a high of 120 degrees;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
