triangular object  flew right over us;1993-08-15 04:00:00;30 - 40 min;triangular object  flew right over us i was sitting by the pool with a  friend at around 4 am. we were looking out into the night sky, talking. When we both noticed a single light appear in the sky pretty far out. it looked like a spot light at first , yet it had no glow to it. we sat there observing this light for about 5 min. when i said to my friend that i think it is coming in our direction. that was exactly what was happening. this object was heading right for us and about 5 min more it had reached our field of vision. my friend got scared and ran towards the house front door but stayed outside. i on the other hand was fixated on this thing going slowly towards my direction. it appeared to be about 15-20 ft above. moving extremely slow. the light appeared to be on the upper part of it. i'm guessing it was about 10 - 20 ft infront of us when the light moved behind it. this object continued towards us. it went right over us it appeared triangular on the bottom but it wasn't sharp edges, sort of round. no light reflected from it and when it was directly over us i saw what i thought was some form of energy movement from underneath it. which appeared rusty reddish in color with a dull illumination. it had a pattern swirling in the center and shooting in the opposite direction of the nose or the point of the object. it appeared to be a dark object with no reflection of any kind and no noise of any kind. the object was approximatly 15 ft long and about 10 feet wide at its bottom. it appeared to be flat on the bottom but not ontop, sort of dome like. we both watched this thing for about 30 to 40 min until it was way out there. then we saw two other lights moving from two other areas and all three were meeting up towards the same point then they all shot up at extremely fast speed into space. this is the closest to a ship i've been but ive seen something else really close too cant really say what it was but can describe it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) i recently sent a email form to your office. even though it sounds absurd, it really happened. i waited so long simply because what i saw was truly life changing! i didn't feel anyone would believe me so i only told one person besides you. after i wrote you i recalled some very important info. i did see this thing at a very close distance and for a very long time. i do not want anything in return, i am not doing this for recognition. if you all have never seen anything like this i am astounded, because this is my secound time, at the same distance but different object.i've seen other things at  further distances ((END));33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
large dark triangle . small white lights at each corner.;2000-10-07 02:45:00;30 seconds;large dark triangle . small white lights at each corner. I went outsideat about 2:30 am to move my car.  After I had moved it, and was walking back into my yard, I glanced up just in time to see a huge dark triangle with a faint white light at each of its three corners. It was moving south east. It didn't seem to be making any noise. I couldnt Judge its altitude but it was about three times the size of a full moon. It looked very sinister, and very unatural. I watched for about half a minute. Then it streaked away at a very high rate of speed. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness means Palm Desert, CA, not CO, as it was listed in the original report.  We have changed it here.   We spoke with this witness at some length, and we found his report to be quite compelling.  He sounded quite serious minded, and seemed quite certain as to what he had witnessed.  PD));33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
Saw a perfect  symmetricalTriangle of three lights all connected by light beams in the North Sky.;2005-03-26 23:14:00;30 seconds;Saw a perfect  symmetricalTriangle of three lights all connected by light beams in the North Sky. My wife and I were in our spa enjoying our late evening. We were hugging and I was looking towards the North while she was looking towards the South. When I started to notice a circular bright white light in the North Sky - and it kept getting brighter, thinking it was just an airplane turning towards Palm Springs for its final approach. When I started to notice there were two 45-degree lights emitting from the bright light at the base. Then there were two additional slightly less bright circular lights at the end of the two 45 degrees lights and then a light that was horizontal from those lights, to create a perfect symmetrical upside down triangle. Thinking - WOW - I said to my wife Look at the upside down triangle with the three bright lights in the sky that seems to be moving very slowly towards us She looked and then was shocked  - saying - what is that got scared then proceeded to run into the house. I stayed there and continued to watch all three lights and the angle lights get less bright and then all together disappear. It was unbelievable - I thought I'd never ever see a UFO!;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
My dog awoke me from a ufo trance where I knew what was happening and was okay with it.;2005-11-24 22:45:00;five minutes;My dog awoke me from a ufo trance where I knew what was happening and was okay with it. I was driving south bound on a back roads from Palm Springs toward Indio, California. I saw a triangle-v shape object drop from the night sky a hundred yards or so into the path of the road I am travelling. Huge bright lights along the triangle shape craft started to have a relaxing affect on me as I slow the vehicle from 50 miles to a crawl when my large dog came from the rear of my van to the front passenger seat barking protectively. The craft hovering left the road area and began to hover on the driver side of the vehicle several feet in the sky in full bloom of these green, blue , red lights maybe 15feet wide each. then the craft flip a few time then headed away from the vehile. I was engage with making the van move quicker in fear and thankful for my dog pulling me out of the trance. I found it difficult to drive away from the craft being amazed of what I saw. I expeience hickups and a false sence of comfort from the lights and its my evaluation the only side affects I felt. My background is some college, almost 50 years old and a professional money manager residing in the Los Angeles Area. I don't do drugs and wasn't drinking and faced with alot of disbelief from those I shared my expeience with.;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
Numerous lighted triangular craft observed simultaneously in different quadrants of sky over Palm Desert, CA.;2008-01-08 18:45:00;45 minutes;Numerous lighted triangular craft observed simultaneously in different quadrants of sky over Palm Desert, CA. Observed numerous triangular shaped craft while driving.  As many as three flying in formation and several singly, simultaneously in widely different quadrants of the sky.  Craft featured bright white lights outlining the shape which sometimes alternated to red/white in a strobing fashion.  Altitude and size difficult to gauge, but closest craft that flew nearly vertical over car was low, possibly 1,500' AGL.  Speed was very slow, but at times seemed to accelerate rapidly.  At least one craft observed appeared to be hovering for several minutes toward the west in the direction of Palm Springs.  At times, the white lights would flash two times with great intensity, then dim down.  The Palmn Springs Film Festival is underway, so the thought occurred to me that it was some sort of promotional stunt for a film?!?  All in all the objects were strange at best.

Triangular UFO sighted in daylight Palm Desert CA on 11/21/11;2011-11-21 16:30:00;5 minutes;Triangular UFO sighted in daylight Palm Desert CA on 11/21/11 UFO SIGHTING APPROXIMATELY 4:30 PM on November 21st 2011  It was still daylight outside and I was on my way to a Chinese restaurant to get something to eat with my wife. My wife was driving and said Look at That. I looked up and saw what appeared to be a Triangular shaped craft near by and flying lower than usual. The shape was clearly defined and easy to see. It was triangular in shape, an isosceles triangle the size of a large airliner. It was a grey/blue colour. It was moving very slowly and close enough that I should of heard its engines, but did not hear anything. I doubt it was more than a mile away and less than a thousand feet up. The craft was making a starboard turn and when I saw the rear of the craft there were lights across the rear except near the corners. Each corner had a white light as did the Centre of the triangle. The lights on the bottom of the craft flickered and it changed the appearance quite a bit, although you could definitely see the triangular outline of the craft. The arrangement of the ligh! ts made it appear like an air liner. A few seconds later, the lights flickered again and this time it looked like the lights of several small planes. looking back on thinks, I really should have pulled over and taken things in better. My wife really wasn't all that excited about it and just kept heading to the restaurant. I guess that was because the only real difference between what we saw and an airliner was the triangular shape. It seemed to move differently though, almost turning like a boat.;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
Two orbs seen flying across sky, slow to a standstill over populated zoo at night, a third orb appears forming a hovering triangle.;2017-10-31 19:35:00;5 minutes--unlimited;Two orbs seen flying across sky, slow to a standstill over populated zoo at night, a third orb appears forming a hovering triangle. 7:35PM October 31, 2017, The Living Desert, Palm Desert, CA  My wife and I are members at our local desert zoo.  The zoo puts on a Howl-o-ween event where thousands of kids, parents are members are invited to walk about and participate in themed mazes, see animals eating etc.  We'd been to the zoo a dozen times in the last year and know it well.   Tonight they illuminated the adjacent fenced off rocky hill for the visitors to view the resident rams.  Shortly after I took a photo of the hill with moonlight clouds above, I saw the end of the cloud cover was nearly directly overhead and that the stars were peaking through. It was only 10 seconds after gazing upward that I saw what looked like two faint stars flying from the clear SW sky, travelling parallel to each other but not in an exact straight line.  One of them was pulsing slowly a bright white color, the other appeared to fade in and out, they could have been mistaken for satellites or planes if they had not drifted and slowed to a standstill almost directly overheard.  At this point I called to my wife, got out my smartphone (which couldn't capture anything of course) and we both saw the orbs slowly stop.   At this point another orb slowly appeared and then the three balls of light seemed to align themselves into a classic UFO triangle.   At this point, shocked, I looked around to see how others were reacting and their were dozens of people all around us but, as expected, they were completely engaged with their costumed kids. The triangles altitude was not much higher than the low-hanging clouds yet their appearance was inconspicuous enough to just appear as other faint stars.  We could see that they weren't exactly still but hovered in place, not pulsing or fading in or out, but just staying still as if pretending to be stars.   After 3 or 5 minutes staring up at the floating triangle, we had to get going, reluctantly.  It felt like winning the jackpot then having to leave your lotto ticket behind.  I was not too surprised by any of this behavior as I have researched many other UFO cases that are nearly exact replicas of this, yet the sheer euphoria and shock of seeing it right before your eyes, out in the open in front of thousands is a power emotion I'll never forget. Researchers and witness have concurred over the years that whatever intelligence these orbs have, it is probably aware of how humans think, and show themselves only just enough for a few to see them, but rarely make an appearance big enough or at the right time for a full-scale sighting with any real earth-shattering consequences. This being my second sighting, and my first in what must be the most populated public outdoor place for the next hundred miles, I believe the UFO definitely knew it could act with impunity.;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
It was over 5 minutes changing colors from red to green to blue to a soft yellow color. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star? PD));2017-11-23 19:00:00;5 minutes;Thanksgiving night, 11/23/17. 7:00pm, my wife called me outside to the Sun deck of our room at the JW Marriott in Palm Desert, CA, and I shot 3 videos from my phone.  It was over 5 minutes changing colors from red to green to blue then a soft yellow color going side to side and up and down before vanishing.   The phone really doesn't capture since the object appears much larger and hovered over the hills.  You can tell it was technology not from this world I did some research and this isn't far from Joshua Tree that lays on the 33rd parallel the same as the great priamids.;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
