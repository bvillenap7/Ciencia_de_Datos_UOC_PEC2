We pulled over, My wife and I driving home and I almost slammed on the brakes.  She said, don't worry, they're just stars.

They first lined up high in the sky like a landing strip and then some broke off into smaller groups.  It might be one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen.   I would love to find out this was some sort of military operation, but I've never seen anything American made move like that.   Finally, I parked the car in a church parking lot, where others approached me to ask if I knew what we were looking at.  Needless to say, I'm totally freaked out.;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
