red pulising lights making triangle formations and hovering;2013-05-24 02:00:00;5 minutes;red pulising lights making triangle formations and hovering two of my friends were leaving for the night, as they were walking out i saw them stop and start recording something up in the sky, ((name deleted))s came running in telling me to come out side quick.  I couldn't tell if it was 3 red lights or a ball of fire, it was pulsing lightly.   At first i thought it was some sort of helicopter hovering but then it started zig zagging as it was going up ever so slightly, then stopped raising and hovered for a minute or two making slight left and right movements almost like triangles then started moving to the right slowly then stopped.   The red ball started flashing inconsistently then faded out, i could see it doing maneuvers far off in the background but it was so lights it hurt my eyes to try and focus that far off.;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
A very bright slow moving fireball appeared from the west heading east.;2015-09-28 19:55:00;5 seconds;As I was driving home heading south on my street Preston Trail in Palm Desert, CA, the moon was very bright and large to my left.  A very bright slow moving fireball appeared from the west heading east.  It appeared to be a comet but moved very slow relative to shooting stars and other comets I have seen.  There did not appear to be a long tail but a very bright almost luminescent vapor trail and their appeared to be a splotch of bright red trailing it.  As it got closer to the very bright full moon off to my left it disappeared like it had burned out.  It didn't appear to be a craft or conventional UFO.  The slow speed and lack of a tail differentiated it from other comets I have seen or would expect to see.  I tried to contact local Palm Desert news stations to inquire if there were additional sightings but I was unable to get a live person.  I thought I would give this a shot in hopes of clarifying whether or not anyone else saw it or reported it.;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
