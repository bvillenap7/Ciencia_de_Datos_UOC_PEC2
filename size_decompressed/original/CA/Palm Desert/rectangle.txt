I was looking up at the sky and I noticed the stars were very visible no clouds when I saw this very very large rectangle that appeared to be right over the Bump an Grind Trail in Palm Desert. It was moving very slowly across the top of the mountains(hills with trails)southbound towards the other trail up to the Cross that is always lit up. The rectangles side visible to me had lights that almost looked like words written across them but nothing I could read. There was no sound at all. I am very familiar with planes and blimps and what they look like at night and what they sound like. At first my brain thought it was a jet airplane but it was not making any sound what so ever and for the sheer size that would mean its very close and I would definitely hear the jet noise. Then I thought maybe it a twin prop plane carrying a lit Christmas banner b! ehind it and then I realized there is no noise and that was ridiculous. I was not on any drugs that would have altered my state. I did see a hikers headlamp shine on the bump and grind trail which is common in early mornings and late evenings but that was the only other thing I could see around that area. the one end of the rectangle eventually started to disappear slowly as if it might be turning possibly, but I am unsure as to why is was disappearing;33.7264414401177;-116.377354886113
