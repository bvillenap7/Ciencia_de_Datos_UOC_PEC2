Bright light moving in sky for about 3 seconds before burning out?;2008-04-15 20:08:00;3 seconds;Bright light moving in sky for about 3 seconds before burning out? Driving home from dinner, I looked up. A bright light caught my eye: slightly brighter than the two airplanes in the sky.  The bright light moved fairly quickly: it covered about 15 degrees of arc in about 3 seconds.  I saw a (much smaller) spark fly off of the light, then the spark faded out.  The main light itself winked out while it was in the air.  I heard nothing I was in my car.  I have no idea what it was. It seemed too fast for an airplane, but too slow for a meteorite.
