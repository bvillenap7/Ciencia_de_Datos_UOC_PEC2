Seen 3 lights zig zagging in the night sky.;2021-02-04 02:00:00;1 1/2 hrs;Seen 3 lights zig zagging in the night sky. Was on patio smoking and glances at one of the unusual bright looking stars. Noticed one blinking a blueish/ red. The others were twinkling white and tan. After staring at one I noticed it did some small zig zags , circles. Up/ down/ left and right.   I then looked at the tan one and it too moved in strange similar patterns. Had to wake mom up and have her see if she seen what I was seeing and then she noticed them move also.  After 1 hr or so they kinda just got dimmer as if leaving.   I tried getting a video on my Apple 6 phone but it wouldn’t pick them up. I did get some snap shot pics tho.  Not sure if I’m imagining it or not but in one pic when I zoomed in I swear I can see a side profile of Jesus as he is seen in paintings with the thorn crowns and all. In another I see what appears to be a shape of a grew as if peeking through some sort of ? Time space dimensional window looking at me.  Very odd. Perhaps I just imagined the images but it was enough fo! r me to start praying to god and Jesus.   But both my mom and I seen them moving. And I’ve seen satellites before and they were Not satellites  moving in circles and zig zags.  I feel blessed to of witnessed them tonight.  They had a twinkle to them also. One with the red and blueish and the other was kinda flashing light as like a mirror reflecting sunlight.;37.5340164179104;-122.032510447761
