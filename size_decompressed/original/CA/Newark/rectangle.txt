San Francisco Bay Area southwest and about 80 degrees above horizon.;2004-06-01 11:00:00;seconds;San Francisco Bay Area southwest and about 80 degrees above horizon. I was outside on break from work.  I heard a jet coming and was looking overhead to see it pass.  This area is the direction the jets pass for landing at the San Francisco Airport.  I couldn't see it so I was then looking approximately southwest and about 80 degrees above horizon and saw a lightening fast dot very, very high in the sky.  It passed then the jet flew overhead and it seemed so slow compared the the dot in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD));37.5340164179104;-122.032510447761
