Object appeared four times, at approximately same location. Angular horizontal position: Sun position + 2-3 degrees clockwise. Angular vertical position: approx. 1/2 of Sun vertical angular position. Brightness was similar to Venus brightness on evening sky however, it was in a daylight. It was slightly cloudy, but it did not seem that object dissapeared when clouds covered it: object was very bright. Every appearance lasted about 10 sec. Then brightness went down gradually and object got invisible on a cloudy background. It was unclear what shape it has. Though, it did not seem as just bright star, it had certain size. 3 or 4 commercial airplanes were in this area at this time 3 jetfighters (I saw inversion traces) fahr south.;37.5340164179104;-122.032510447761
