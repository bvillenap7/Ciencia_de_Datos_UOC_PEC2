Orange Triangle shaped craft;2009-04-15 23:00:00;30 seconds;Orange Triangle shaped craft My girlfriend and I were walking outside, around 11pm at night. Usually when she leaves my home she we’re outside talking for a few minutes before she leaves. Normally, I always like to look into the sky check out stars I can see, planets, or constellations. On this night I noticed the craft moving at a very common speed in comparison to Earth aircraft. This craft was triangle in shape.  This object had absolutely no sound and was moving in one direction from North-west direction to a South-East direction. This object was at a height of a private passenger plane. It was so apparent in the sky in contrast to the background of the night that my girlfriend had no problem recognizing the craft immediately when I pointed out to her. The glow on the bottom side of the craft had what I would only describe as a “dusk” orange on the bottom side of the craft. The shape can best described as a stealth bomber.  The only recording device I had on me at the time was my iphone 3g and I snapped some pictures when it was already out of view. I am attaching the ones I believe are the photos from that night. I am more than experienced to realize that this is not Mars and was no known aircraft I've ever seen in the area. As regular commercial jets fly around our area often and can normally be heard. Whereas this particular object had absolutely no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.5340164179104;-122.032510447761
