I saw a ufo.;2008-06-30 04:13:00;10sec.;I saw a ufo. I was laying down on my raft in my pool looking up at the sun blocking the direct light with my fist. When I saw a circle like, balloon like, white sphere in the sky.   I first saw the object when I was on my back looking to my right which was south.  My head was west and my feet were pointed in a eastly direction.  The craft moved very guickly directly over me.  When I fisrt saw the object it appeared to be higher in altitude when I kept my eye on it  , it seemed to become bigger but still moving away to fast for me to believe. By the time I got off my raft and to the side of the pool it was a lot higher and was headed north at a high rate of speed  about 800 miles per hour.  I live in a fight patten   for Burbank Airport and I see planes coming in and out.  This was moving at least 3 to 4 times the speed as a regular aircraft........;34.1676000000001;-118.3892
