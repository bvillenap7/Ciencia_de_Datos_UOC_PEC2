Noticed a large object with a slow-2 sec. pulsed glow over entire area of object at about 15 sec. intervals above the spares cloud cover.  Object moved very fast and changed directions several times within in 2-3 sec. and continued south east.  Followed by similar object, though different path but equal in behavior. event lasted 60-90 sec. each.  Elliptical in shape - follows mathematical coefficients. 2.  Same direction - noticed what would be best described as very - high altitude dispersed lighting.  One flash only. I'm the ultimate skeptic – this is not my first observation.  Don't have $10 million in camera equipment needed that ready to go at a moments notice.  Had a bright LED flash light and I did flash a sequence of primes!;34.1676000000001;-118.3892
