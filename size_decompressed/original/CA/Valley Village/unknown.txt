Orange light in the sky with a green cloud and sky being light up brightly over 30 feet;2015-11-07 18:14:00;40 seconds;Orange light in the sky with a green cloud and sky being light up brightly over 30 feet I saw an orange light going diagonally in the sky. The orange light then extended itself for maybe 3 sec. It then passed behind a building so I couldn’t see it anymore. When it passed that building it left a green colored cloud and the UFO stopped to light up the green “cloud”.  It projected a very strong light horizontally (approx. 30 feet long). It then started it again moving diagonally in the sky with its light on and left in the sky. The green cloud just stayed there even when I was leaving 5 minutes later.  You could still see the light from very far away in the sky. I have never see anything like it.;34.1676000000001;-118.3892
