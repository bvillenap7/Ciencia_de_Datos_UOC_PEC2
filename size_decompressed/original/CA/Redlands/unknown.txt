White lights going around massive circular object.;2016-04-09 21:30:00;3 hours;White lights going around massive circular object It was the night of April 09, 2016 as I was riding my bike back home from getting something to eat in Redlands, CA.  For a while I enjoyed watching the sunsets, walking in the rain, and looking up at the stars, so as I was looking up at the night sky I noticed two lights crossing back and forth from each other. As I continued to ride home, I thought the lights were just a couple of helicopters.  5 min later I saw the lights again, but they seemed closer and I could see them more clearly.  The two lights were not any aircraft as they were moving too fast back and forth.  So I got my phone out to try to take a video but it was too dark but for some reason I could take clear pictures, so I spent and hour taking numerous pictures as the objects disappeared and reappeared every few seconds.  They were not red or blue but just a plain white colored light, so a good 30 min passed before I finally decided to go home. Once I got home, I've noticed a pattern of the lights, they were not two objects passing back and forth, but two lights going around this one circular object.  I saw this by the way the lights pointed as they disappeared and reappeared in this pattern behind the clouds in the sky.  I don't know if the object was the shape of a sphere, circle, oval, or cylinder as I only saw the lights going in a circular motion.  The best way to describe  what a saw was this circular object with two white lights on the object going around it.   Three hours later I decided to go outside to see if the lights were still there and they were.  My father, sister, and I saw these lights.  I would say the object was pretty massive, no where near the size of an airplane.  The way the lights were traveling around it I would approximate the size as the length of 10 planes or even bigger. I don't believe I was abducted as I kept track of time because I've heard stories before and I haven't had any physical harm.  I  hope someone else out there in Redlands or highland saw this object that I saw that night.;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
