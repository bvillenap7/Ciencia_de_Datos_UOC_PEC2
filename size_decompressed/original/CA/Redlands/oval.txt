Large glowing oval object hovering in field over Redlands(San Timoteo Cyn.) ranch;2001-02-18 19:00:00;2 minutes;Large glowing oval object hovering in field over Redlands(San Timoteo Cyn.) ranch We live on a 10-acre ranch in San Timoteo Canyon.  Our ranch is situated between low hills to the north and the south in a rather remote area three families live on the property in separate residences.  At about 7 p.m. on Feb. 18, our neighbor's 14-year-old daughter started knocking on our door yelling that there was a flying saucer in the canyon.  We didn't believe her, but we rushed outside to see what was up anyway.  When we got outside we saw an enormous glowing oval-shaped object hovering in the sky to the south.  The object was about a quarter of a mile away and about 300 feet off of the ground.  It was a bright flourescent pale, pale greenish silver.  I perceived a domed top, and a row of different colored lights running horizontally across it.  It had a white light on the bottom of it.  It was hanging very low above the field, and then it slowly moved west behind a hill.  We ran and got our quad-runner out of the barn and raced up to the top of the hill along the power road to see if we could get another look at it, but there was nothing up there.  Our neighbor suggested that it might be a blimp, but it looked nothing like a blimp, it was much too large, and there was no good explanation as to why a blimp would be flying so low through the canyon at night in the dark.  We called the Redlands PD to see if anyone else had reported anything unusual, but we told no.  We've been trying to get through to March ARB which is near our home, but their line has been busy.;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
ufo sighting in redlands, california;2001-11-23 22:00:00;10 minutes;ufo sighting in redlands, california this whole event took place at approximately 10:30 p.m. a couple days before Thanksgiving 2001 in the town of Redlands, California.  me and my sister were headed westbound on colton avenue to meet some friends at a bar when i noticed in the sky to the south of us an object hovering in the sky.  it was an orange reddish glowing oval-shaped object.  it was so bizarre i asked my sister to pull the car over so that see could see it too.  when we pulled over we both got out of the car and stared at this thing in the sky.  about a minute elapsed and this object appeared to be dropping things from it.  About 30 comet-looking balls were dropped from the craft.  i told my sister it looked as if it were deploying something.  each of the comets fell at the same velocity but were deployed at irregular intervals.  during the whole event the ufo wobbled there as it hung in the sky.  after we stood there in awe of this thing for about ten minutes we freaked out and went home.  we were convinced this was the end of the world. of course it wasn't the end of the world.  i called 911 and they laughed at me, but both me and my sister saw something neither one of us had ever seen or could comprehend.  we are still convinced we saw a ufo.  as i listened to peter speak on coast to coast am i had to email this in to the website.

it looked like and orange glowing ball that moved like no object i ever seen in the skies;2008-03-12 22:20:00;night;it looked like and orange glowing ball that moved like no object i ever seen in the skies I was on my way home from work from Loma Linda CA.  going east towards Redlands CA. down a backroad a couple of miles from the 10 freeway i noticed a lot of planes in the sky because of how clear it was I noticed an orange colored object about 80 degrees overhead it seem to stay as still as a star but I realized it was way to close to earth to be a star.  For about a minute it then abruptly started to move west and then it changed course abruptly moving east  and then just stayed in its position. For about 15 seconds it then drifted again east traveling up in a higher elevation By this time I pulled over and someone else behind me pulled over and we got out of our cars at the same time. We both were trying to figure out what it was. The most acurate part to what  we both saw was that there was about three planes coming in different directions coming towards each other so comparing the way it moved and looked was very much different compared to the planes we were looking at in the sky. The planes in the sky had blinking lights like every plane does at night and this craft did not.  The craft then again moved straight up in elevation then  stayed in its position for another 30 seconds and disappeared in the direction of space. Me and this person I have never met stayed by the street and  looked to see if it would reappear, it didn't. But for the next 30 minutes there seemed to be a lot of  airplane activity in the same area.;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
Bright falling object falls in a direct line than maneuvers an L shape at tremendous speed;2017-03-13 20:50:00;30 seconds;Bright falling object falls in a direct line than maneuvers an L shape at tremendous speed. At approximately 8:50 pm, while turning into my apartment complex, and was about to pull into my parking space, a falling bright white light that was north/east above the municipal airport caught my attention.  I stopped and noticed that the object, a bright white round looking object, which in the night sky would be about as bright as a star in the night sky.  This object came down at an a tremendous speed, and the amazing thing about the light was it came straight down, than made an instant maneuver as an L light down, than light sped off horizontally and I only caught the seconds of this object whisking behind the trees that blocked my view.  However, the bright white light was for a brief few seconds in my sight.  I immediately pulled out of my parking to take a drive in the direction of this light object to see if I could or might see it again , and pulled over to watch and did not see this light again.   Within 30 minutes, I heard the sheriff helicopter in the area, could be unrelated, circling the in the area for about 15 minutes.;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
It was bright red tinted light oval shape and vanished quickly when I took a picture.;2018-05-04 02:00:00;15 seconds;It was bright red tinted light oval shape and vanished quickly when I took a picture. A bright red tinted oval shaped light, on the East side of my house about a 1/2 to 1 mile away stationary over the Redlands Airport, caught my attention.  I opened the bedroom door to get a better look.  I got my phone to take a picture.  As the light from my camera came on, the object zoomed/streaked to my left North towards the mountains and its light diminished/ disappeared.   I checked my camera and only showed a penpoint (few pixels) like light, not the oval, egg shape I saw.  There was no sound.;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
