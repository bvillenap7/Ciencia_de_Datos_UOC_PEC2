Sunday, January 2nd, 2000, approx. 9:30PM A Redlands resident, who is also a licensed civilian pilot, witnessed a flaming green fireball descending slowly, making a (jet-like) roaring sound. The witness reports that at first he thought it was a 747 going down, it was so large.  The object appeared to move at a speed of about 4-5 knots and was estimated at an altitude of 4 to 5,000 ft. when he saw it.  He watched it descend in an easternly direction and said it appeared to him that the object crash landed here in the area.  He describes the object as round in shape, as near as he could tell by the objects extreme brightness and the color was a beautiful green - like burning metals.  Size as large or larger than the full moon.  He called the local Sheriff Dept. and newspaper and was told that it was a meteor.  He said, He's seen alot of meteors in his day but this didn't look like any meteor he'd ever ever seen before - if he didn't know better he'd swear it was under intelligent control.
