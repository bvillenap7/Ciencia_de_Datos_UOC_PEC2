Bright light moving accross horizon then breaking-up and falling to earth.;2000-06-16 00:05:00;5 minutes;Bright light moving accross horizon then breaking-up and falling to earth. At first appeared to be an aircraft with unusual bright lights that seemed to suround the flying object. Its altitude appeared to be normal for aircraft coming from one the local airports. Its travil was from the west to the northeastern skies (heading toward the Plam Springs area). Speed was consistant with that of a airliner. flight path was not stable but seem to move in an up-down motion. When the object appeared over the horizon, a section fill toward the earth and then the whole object fill toward the earth and disappeared. Drove up to Crafton Hills College which gives a fair view of the valley looking to the eastern horizon, nothing abnormal seen. The lights of the opbject was very bright and appeared white to red in color. I am a Quality Assurance Administrator/ FAA-DMIR.

Singular light in night sky.  Shifted intensity irregularly.  Appeared to give off red, green, white, blue, purple light.;2003-11-19 23:00:00;30 minutes;Singular light in night sky.  Shifted intensity irregularly.  Appeared to give off red, green, white, blue, purple light. I've never done this before.  But over the past month or so, I've seen an bright light in the night sky.  To the naked eye, it looks like it is the intensity of Mars when it was at its closest to Earth.  But Mars is unmistakably reddish-orange.  This light appeared to change in intensity quickly and irregularly.  Through binoculars and a telescope other colors such as green, red, white, blue, and purple were distinguishable.  I have a Canon A70 camera.  I haven't learned all of the settings of the camera, but I tried to take pictures with a longer exposure so as to capture as much light as I could.  Here are some of the photos I took.  If you zoom in about 600% you'll see the object more clearly.  I live in Redlands, California.  I'd say that the object was in a southern direction.  Standing out if front of a two story house, the object was below the top of the roof.  I noticed it tonight November 19,2003 at approximately 11:00 pm.  I observed it for about 30 minutes.  In the first few minutes I could tell it was moving relative to another star that was visible near it.  After about 5 mintues or so, it seemed to stop.  Under a telescope, it moved gently off of view.  So it looked like it was still moving, but very very slowly.  Under binoculars and telescope, the light appeared to be 'rectagular' or 'cylindrical'.  It was longer up and down that it was wide from right to left.  Any how, here are a few of the pics I took.  I don't mind being contacted if you think it's anything worth checking into.

It slowly moved across the sky that dropped  orange sparks that were the same color as the object. the sparks then dissapeared about 1/4 in the sky. There was a plane quite a way away from it and there was a helicopter flying torwards it but way below it. once the helicopter came just a little  bit close it vanished and never appeared again that night.It was about 60 degrees from were i was standing and the object had no flashing lights it was a constant light but the dissapeared right as it started moving torward my house ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two fast lights matching speed and distance across the night sky;2008-03-25 20:10:00;Two minutes;Two fast lights matching speed and distance across the night sky My fiance and myself were out on our balcony having a cigarette, when we saw a bright light high in the sky.  There were a number of commercial aircraft in the air to compare the light to.   The light we saw was not blinking, emitted no noise, and appeared to be moving faster than an aircraft and much higher up in the sky.  It moved at a steady, unchanging pace across the sky for about a minute before it was joined by a second light behind it.   We approximated it's distance from the first light to be about 30,000 feet, and the trailing light maintained this distance until both lights vanished from view on the horizon.  The trailing light at no point moved faster or slower than the leading light, nor got closer or father away.   Neither produced any sound, or any light besides a single bright colorless point of light (which in both cases dimmed perceptibly to a pinprick of light before brightening back up.   This occurred as a slow fade in and out, and did not seem to be a strobe or airplane marker light.);34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
Red/white light first mistaken for a shooting star then went in a zigzag pattern before disappearing.;2011-07-22 21:45:00;4-6 seconds;Red/white light first mistaken for a shooting star then went in a zigzag pattern before disappearing. Only July 22 at 9:45 p.m., my wife and I were leaving a concert at the Redlands Bowl in Redlands, CA, when I saw what I first thought was a shooting star traveling north.   I realized that it was not a shooting star because it was visible too long and did not leave a trail.  I thought it may be a satellite, but then discounted that because of the speed it was traveling across the sky.   I pointed it out to my wife who saw it as well.  We watched as it travelled north then made two or three zigzags and disappeared.  I remember it as a white light with a red light next to it and my wife thought it looked more like three red lights.   The light pattern leads me to believe it was a plane, but it was very high and the speed it traveled and the zigzag pattern were not like a plane.  It only lasted about 5 or 6 seconds and traversed most of the sky.;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
Blue-gray glowing object moved very fast and disappeared.;2013-04-10 21:12:00;3-5 seconds;Blue-gray glowing object moved very fast and disappeared. On April 10, 2013, my husband and I, in separate cars were driving east on Interstate 10 in Redlands, California.  He was about a minute to 90 seconds behind me.  The time was about 9:12 p.m. PDT. Despite fairly heavy traffic around me, I noticed a very fast-moving object heading from north to south above the eastern horizon.  It was just above treetops from my view.  It was not fiery or bright like a meteorite, and it was far too fast to be any kind of aircraft.  It glowed enough to be visible, obviously, and was dull blue-gray. The size was very hard to judge, since I don't know how far away it was.  Compared to the planets, it was larger than Venus but not bright.  It did not leave a trail. Its path was straight.  I lost sight of it after perhaps 3 or 4 seconds. My husband had a clearer view from a higher point on the freeway.  He observed the object for 4 to 5 seconds before it disappeared on the horizon.  His impression of it was exactly the same as mine, the dull gray-blue, the flat trajectory.   He said it might have appeared smaller in size when it disappeared. On land, from the point where he first noticed it to where it vanished is a distance of about 15 miles. I pulled off the freeway and parked to watch the sky, and he pulled in a minute later.  I saw nothing else unusual.   He was glad I had seen the object, too, so I didn’t dismiss it as a light reflected in his car’s windshield. I have not been able to find anything on the web about similar sightings at that time.;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
Strange Amber-Orange Light seen in Redlands, California, on July 4th.;2015-07-04 20:30:00;30-45 seconds;Strange Amber-Orange Light seen in Redlands, California, on July 4th. At about 8:30 PM on Saturday, July 4th, I was sitting in our front yard in Redlands, California, waiting with friends and family to watch the annual fireworks display at the University of Redlands Football Stadium.   I had been sitting and talking with my friend who is a medical doctor at an area hospital.   There were a number of small aircraft flying around the area, which is typical around here on July 4th, but one aircraft really stood out.  Instead of the typical red and green blinking position lights as seen on the surrounding aircraft, this particular aircraft had one amber-orange light.  It appeared to be the size of a large, bright planet…possibly a bit larger.  It moved in a west to east trajectory north of Redlands in the direction of Mentone, California.  My friend and I watched it for 30-45 seconds.   As I continued to watch the light, I kept saying to her, “That doesn’t look like an airplane.”   It appeared to be moving about the same speed as the small airplanes in the area, but unlike those other aircraft it maintained a constant altitude.   My friend looked away briefly, but I kept watching it.  Then before my eyes it abruptly disappeared.   When it disappeared, I exclaimed to her, “It disappeared!”  She looked back at me and said, “That must not have been an airplane!”  I am kicking myself because we had a yard full of people, and I didn’t say anything to anyone else but my friend.  I didn’t even tell my husband, who is a retired USAF navigator.  He reprimanded me, saying, “The next time you see something like that tell me!”;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531

Green light craft or object disappears in the sky;2016-07-06 09:00:00;5 seconds;Green light craft or object disappears in the sky I was driving my mom home to Palm Desert from Los Angeles via 210 east. On the left side - passenger side over head, a large green light came swooping down over to the left of the highway and just disappeared.  It moved like a craft, very smooth.  Could have been a meteorite. I meant to report it earlier but got sidetracked and forgot till I was listening to delayed show cast of CTC and when your report came on.  The ironic thing was I was telling my work colleague about it while we were listening to it and then the next minute you reported a green lighter object from another report somewhere else. Ironic.  All I could say was, see!?  Anyway, it was quick, but exciting siting and if someone else saw it that night in that area, I would be interested to hear about it  maybe there's an earthly explanation but I found it intriguing. Thanks for listening.;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
