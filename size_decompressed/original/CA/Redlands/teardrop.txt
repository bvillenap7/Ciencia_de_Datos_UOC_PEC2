A green object caught my attention from the corner of my eye while driving on the 10 freeway. I glanced out my window and saw a greenish comet shaped object flying away from me traveling North. It was bright and my first thought was a meteor except the low intensity “burn” was green and steady instead of fiery colored and flickering. The comet shape, like a circle or oval with a tail did not leave a trail and the whole thing winked out of existence a few inches about the horizon. It was too big to be a satellite or aircraft and moved too quickly to be anything I have seen before. It streaked across from my vantage point at the top of my window to almost the horizon, distant mountains, in less than 3 seconds.;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
