Blinking light hovers toward Palm Springs from Redlands;2014-03-08 03:50:00;5 mins;Blinking light hovers toward Palm Springs from Redlands Plain and simple, I went for an early morning jog and spotted something strange in the sky. It wasn't changing location like a normal plane, but instead just staying in one spot.   It was blinking in an abnormal pattern.   I have the actual evidence recorded through video.  It may not be clear enough to justify as a UFO but in this circumstance was very strange and peculiar so I recorded it just in case.;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
