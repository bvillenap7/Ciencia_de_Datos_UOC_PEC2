Pea-Sized Dim Amber Glowing Disk Within A Perfect Black Circle @ about 10K Feet  Above;2010-09-03 23:00:00;4 seconds;Pea-Sized Dim Amber Glowing Disk Within A Perfect Black Circle @ about 10K Feet  Above On September 3, 2010, at 2300 hours PDT, low-lit glowing amber disc, surrounded by perfect rigid black ring, flying craft passed over Redlands, California, from East to West, traveling 4-5 times faster than any jet aircraft heading to ONT/LAX.   The craft flew straight and appeared under 10,000 feet above.  The glowing craft was perfectly round and had no navigation lights, and it made no sound.  There was also a jet liner heading to ONT in the same sky, but flying much slower.  It is my first and only sighting.   I wished I had not seen it it is easier to to believe that true UFO's do not exist when one has never seen one.;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
8 round orange balls coming from the south, heading towards the mountains.;2015-01-01 00:00:00;12:30 a.m. 3:30 a.m.;8 round orange balls coming from the South, heading towards the mountains. The date that this event took place is january 1, 2015.  I had just came back from a get together with my family.  Me and my dad were the first once to arrive at my house. Then my sister arrived with her baby girl from our get together.  She took out her baby girl out of the car and came inside the house.  She was trying to put her baby to sleep. Afterwards, my sister went outside to get something from her car.  Then she said, she saw an orange circle down the street do south of my house.  My sister said it was really low and then it went up to the sky.  She got scared.  The orange circle past up my drive way and headed to the mountains. Then, my sister came inside the house and told me to come outside.  She can barely speak. She said it was urgent!   At first it was me and my sister that went outside.  When I saw that orange light of circle in the sky, I told my sister that its just a plane.  But as I started to focus more on the flying object, it did not look like anything I've ever seen before.  I was very shocked.   My dad came out of the house to see what was going on.  This was around twelve thirty something cause I didn't check the time. I told my dad  to go get my tablet. When I got the tablet, I started to take pictures.  Then video. As i was recording, my dad     yelled  out to me, theirs another one coming from the south! I aimed my tablet to capture them on video.  Then another one was coming from the same direction.  Then I starded taking video again cause to more were coming from the same direction. They all headed to where the other flying objects were.  I capture at least 4 flying objects coming from the south and headed towards the mountains.  I got 2 pictures, and 3 videos on my tablet. Then I told my sister to go get her camera so she can record the flying objects. We stayed outside for a couple of minutes to capture them on video. Then we went inside our house. Finally, when everyone was asleep, at 3:26 a.m., I went outside to see if they were still there. They were, and still in the same position that we saw them.  My dad counted to see how many flying objects we saw and he said 8 in total.;34.0518481481481;-117.171964197531
