Triangle shaped Gray craft with one red light on the center and small lights in the rear flys over me in Redlands CA;2011-07-21 04:00:00;2 minutes;Triangle shaped Gray craft with one red light on the center and small lights in the rear flys over me in Redlands CA I was at my work site working security grave yard shift.  I was outside looking up at the stars because one star was very bright and close and it caught my attention. Then I see a red light flashing very high up and close to this light I'm looking at it thinking to myself this air plane has to see the light I'm looking at since it is right next to it. The red light kept coming in my direction for about 1 minute getting lower and closer to me.The red light was flashing on and off about one time per second.As it got closer to me I noticed it was a triangle shaped dark gray object with a red light in the center.I would say maybe 80 ft long from corner to corner and 10 ft tall from top to bottom flying very slowly about 30mph.It had no wings and it made no noise.As it hovered directly over my head about 150ft above me the center where the red light was opened up.It was a circle right in the center of the craft that had 4 doors that opened up right over my head the red light disappeared and I saw a very bright white light inside the craft.You can not see inside the craft just the bright white light.It kept moving very slow past me and about 3 seconds later it closed the center up and the red light showed up again and it flew off in the same slow speed over the truck yard I was guarding.As it flew away I saw six small white lights on the rear of the craft on the bottom to top side.The lights were flashing from left to right very fast over and over.Anyone could have seen this craft it was very low and moving slow not hiding at all.I'm very afraid as to why it opened up like it was going to abduct me when it was over me.It looks identical to the triangle shaped ufo with the red light in the center with 1 light on each corner.Except the one I saw only had the red light on the bottom center no other lights on the bottom and small flashing lights on the rear.I could see carvings on the craft also it was not solid.I am not one to believe in s! tuff like this but now I have no doubt in my mind.I wish I wou! ld've ha d a camera ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
