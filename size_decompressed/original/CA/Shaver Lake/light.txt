Intense light over Shaver Lake, California.;1990-07-01 00:30:00;1-2 minutes;Intense light over Shaver Lake, California. While riding my motorcycle from Fresno, to my home in Prather, California, my girlfriend and I came into a clearing atop a mountain when the entire night sky lit up like daylight. All I could see was, a massively bright light over my left shoulder and about 10 miles out. It appeared to be over the Shaver Lake community and even though this light was about 3/4 to 1 mile long and 1/4 mile high, it wasn't focused on us. Whatever it was looking at was on the mountain it was hovering over, yet the light was blinding from over 10 miles away. I stopped my chopper in the middle of the road and the light just went out. I shut off the bike, but I couldn't hear a sound. Not even the summer bugs were making any sound. Kinda freaky. Anyway, I lit up a smoke and my girlfriend said, Did you see that?? I looked over my shoulder and said, What'd YOU see?? We never saw anything about it in any of the local papers or on t.v. or anything. I didn't think anyone else in the world had seen it until I was reading one of the reports on this website. That's pretty cool. I thought I'd lost my damn mind and I pretty much kept it to myself.;37.1397;-119.273
