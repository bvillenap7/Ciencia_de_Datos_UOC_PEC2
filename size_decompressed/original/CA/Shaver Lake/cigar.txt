The large object appeared to have a row of lights I was driving down the mountain with my friend just below Shaver Lake Ca from work at about 3:30 in the morning when we came around a bend in the road and observed an extremely large object that appeared to be stalled or hovering above the tree line. At first I thought it was a Goodyear blimp or an airliner, but it was too close to the trees tops over head. The object was motionless. The large object appeared to have a row of light on its side and made a deep humming sound. There were a number of smaller lights that appeared to be surrounding the object. I have no idea what the object was. My friend and I watched the object for a few minutes and proceeded down the mountain. It has been a number of years since this observation and I can still picture it in my mind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date is approximate.  PD));37.1397;-119.273
