Moved very slowly away from us but then shinned very bright light at us! This info is as close as I can remember: Me and my brother inlaw were on a four wheel drive trip to the top of Bald Mountain in Shaver Lake Ca. Shortly after we had arrived at the top of the mountain my brother inlaw saw somthing behind me slightly above our elevation in the valley between us and the nearest mountain 1/2 to 3/4 mile across. The craft was triangular with 7 red lights across the leading edge. The lights did not flash and were very bright. The object moved very slowly. (too slow for for any aircraft to stay airborn)I would say the craft was 100 yards across Min. The most amazing thing about the whole sighting was when my brother inlaw shinned a high power flashlight at it. It shinned a VERY bright white light back at us! I dont remember what happened after that,the next thing I knew we had cut our trip short and were headed home. We dont talk about that night any more but the last time I mentioned it to him he asked me if I could remeber any more about it. Neither one of us can. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

triangle black military craft.;2011-03-22 15:00:00;2 minutes;triangle black military craft. Perhaps I shouldn't report this, but somehow it might help.  We heard a thunderous noise and went outside to see 3 black triangle shaped aircraft.  Following these were 3 more. All made very loud noise.  These had to be military in origin.  It was facinating as each of the 3 were in triangle formation one out front followed by 2. We live in the forest and this was very unusual.  So no UFO to report. Perhaps you might know what these craft were?  They were headed from NE to SW, and there is the Lemore Naval Station 60 miles to the SW.  We're about 4,500'.  So these were perhaps 6-7k feet.  Real close.;37.1397;-119.273
