We were at our cabin in the mountains and getting ready to leave. As we approached our car, I noticed in the northern sky, just above the tree line a string of lights flying in a straight line from West to East. They were evenly spaced and all going about the same speed. I would normally think it would be a satellite, but there were so many of them. This parade or formation of lights lasted for several minutes, I would say at least 3 minutes. They faded and gradually disappeared as they headed East. There had to be over 100 lights. Eventually they stopped, but it was a very consistent formation, a straight line of lights all flying across the sky (not falling like a meteor, or space debris) They were too far away to see any shape or color Although I am somewhat skeptical of UFO's, I don't disbelieve. This is definitely the first time I have ever made any type of report. My background: I have a college education, am over 60 yrs old and do not drink alcohol or do drugs.;37.1397;-119.273
