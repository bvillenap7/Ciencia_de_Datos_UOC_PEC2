Only in picture!  I have seen lights in this area before, while fishing. I only stopped to take A picture of A wild fire in the middle of winter.  I took two real quick pictures with my cell phone and went on my way.  Was headed to Shaver Lake to look at new houses being built, when I noticed a column of smoke rising from the easterly direction.  I pulled over as I said and took two quick pictures.   Two days later, when I am looking at picture on my phone that I took an hour later of job sites I was looking at, I noticed something in the pictures I took of the Smoke!  I have no idea what it was? ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the photos, and all we see is a tiny dark spot.  The object could be a bird, possibly a relatively large soaring bird, we suspect.  PD));37.1397;-119.273
