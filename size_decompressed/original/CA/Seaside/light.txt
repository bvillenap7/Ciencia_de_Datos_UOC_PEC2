((anonymous report));2019-09-10 21:30:00;30 seconds;Lights seen above the Monterey Bay facing Monterey from Seaside.  Lights were in a strange pattern moving eastward.  Looked like a right flash of white light (like a star that is close) then disappears (each lasted about 2 seconds).  As soon as one disappears, then another one shows up to the left again, and again x10? times.  In a straight line... to the left, maybe a few miles between one another.  Then after these 10? times they disappeared.   If anyone else saw this please post your sighting.;36.6217;-121.7935
