Felt good getting this off my chest in detail my arm hairs are stilll standing up and its been almost a hour and a half. theres other details that i remember looking back at it like a plane in the background when i was driving on freeway but it was way up in the air that i thought for a split second that those were s! trange bright red yellow orangs stars i never seen i think i s! aid that already . im going to go talk to those guys about wht they saw them do and i hope its on the news and i wanted to call the police but then say what.i do believe in aliens but to watch it in person i kinda think i really didnt want to see that.everthing looks a lot different now that i saw this day to day worries are going to feel alort smaller and easy to deal with.It dont matter what i used to think was possible because in a way its all possible a new look on life WOW;36.6217;-121.7935
