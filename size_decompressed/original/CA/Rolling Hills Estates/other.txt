I noticed a light which was pretty high like a star moving Southwest towards San Diego.  It was an even light, low constant glow, moving fast for the high altitude it was moving at.  I thought maybe it was an aircraft but it had no marker lights flashing.  Then, I thought well it was a Satellite, I have seen them before moving straight across the sky, but then it curved out to the sea, and faded out.  You don't see aircraft at night unless they have flashing lights and Satellites move in straight lines.  I'll keep looking.  Thank You;33.7671;-118.3814
