My 16 year old son and me went out to our front yard with our dog to scare off a flock of crows that where picking at our lawn. I estimate the object to have been at least ¼ of a mile away and about less than 1000 feet in the air. There is a Freeway located below in the path the object was moving. My guess is that this object was probably moving at about the same speed as the cars below which is 65 miles per hour. We looked at the object to where it looked like a small dot in the distance. The object then suddenly veered upwards and then we could no longer see it in the distance.  The color of the object looked like some type of burned chrome or dull alloy. It resembled a US Stealth Bomber, but without the wings(side view) and the color. In the background, we saw a large airplane heading to Los Angeles International Airport. The airplane was heading east to west and the object north to south. It crossed directly in the planes path, except it was about a few hundred feet lower.  I am a 34-year-old Freight Transportation Contractor and my son is a High School Student. We are both very skeptical of such things. I have to say that this was a rush for me. I just had to tell someone. I was going to phone the sheriffs department, but what would they think of a local business owner without any footage.;33.9892760479043;-118.089002994012
Four saucer shaped UFO's low into LAX landing flght path on 6/20/14;2014-06-20 21:40:00;4 minutes;Four saucer shaped UFO's low into LAX landing flght path on 6/20/14. Event Date:  6/20/14  City:  Pico Rivera  State:	  California  On the evening of Friday June 20th, 2014, my wife and I were le1aving Walmart at approximately 9:40 p.m. California time. I chose to take the street behind the Walmart and Lowes to get to Rosemead Blvd to go home.  As I turned left heading east, there they were four UFO’s!  I am an avid aviation enthusiast and I know an airplane or a helicopter when I see one.  These were not identifiable aircraft.  They were in fact entering the flight path of LAX traffic.  I stopped in the center area of the street, pointed to them to a passing truck and he stopped to look. These four moving flying disks were wobbling and moving slowly towards us, the color was orangeish/yellowish, the light was only coming from the bottom of the craft’s.  As they approached, one turned right, or North, the others followed. Now they are only a few hundred feet from us.  A clear night and I could see them extremely clearly.  The lead craft turned off its lights and I could actually see it better and clearer.  It was a saucer for sure!  The lead saucer immediately came down to only a couple of hundred feet off of the ground. Just as the craft’s started north, my wife yelled out, I hear a jet, I looked over my left shoulder, and a jumbo jet was making a hard right turn to avoid the craft!  I see these jets turn to make their approach all the time this one was an avoidance turn!   My wife was extremely scared and was screaming for me to leave, so I left the scene as the four UFO’s or Flying Saucers were heading north.;33.9892760479043;-118.089002994012
