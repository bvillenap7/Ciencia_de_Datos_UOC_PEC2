Actually we have seen these objects on various evenings for approx. one month. For the past wo evenings we have seen these lighted objects overhead orange in lighted color. On the morning of 5/31/04 at approx, two am five of us witnessed this object and twice it released what appeared to be like balls of the light (orange) that would fade as they went down what seems to be a hundred or so feet? We saw the same thing happen this evening. At other times it is moving low through the sky and at times hovering then fading to a blinking light. Sometimes they just fade out like the fireballs they release.;33.9892760479043;-118.089002994012

I saw a white light high in the sky.  It never flickered.  As it was moving E, the light slowly disappeared.  ((anonymous report));2019-07-04 21:30:00;8 seconds;Was outside looking at the fireworks when I saw a white light high in the sky.  It never flickered.  As it was moving East the light slowly dulled until it disappeared.  It couldn't have been a sky lantern because it was too high.
