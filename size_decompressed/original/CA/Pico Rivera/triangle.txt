The craft descended on a weaving arc closer to the ground. It hovered for 15 seconds, changed light patterns and light color from white to a intense red in which after the lights adjusted a dark scalene triangle was present and hovering for about 15-20 seconds. it reversed from its original direction and made a sweeping arc over the freeway over a hill top and into the clouds and fog. Brief burst of light were seen in the clouds before losing sight of it completely. There were two other witnesses my friend and brother.

Propeller shaped object rights itself and then vanishes in broad daylight.;2012-12-06 13:30:00;5 seconds;Propeller shaped object rights itself and then vanishes in broad daylight This afternoon i was driving home on the 605 freeway headed south from the 60 freeway. i saw something that was whiteish and that glinted like it was metallic.  It looked at first like an airplane banking in the sky.   But then I saw that it was shaped like three very propellers.  The banking effect was the object turning so that one of the three fins or propellers was vertical.   It glinted for a second and then seemed to vanish into the surrounding atmosphere. The object appeared to be about 5 miles away, west of the freeway. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.9892760479043;-118.089002994012
Red, and White flashing lights flying over Pico Rivera, Ca;2014-11-13 19:00:00;15 minutes;Red, and White flashing lights flying over Pico Rivera, Ca I saw two lights one was a flashing red light, and the other was a white light that was a distance away from the other.  So about 2 minutes later the one that was further out showed a real big bright white light and started moving in a fast pace towards the other that was just in a stand still once it got close, that's when the red light started moving away while the other stood still 3 minutes later the white light slowly started going in the apposite direction until it disappeared.;33.9892760479043;-118.089002994012
