Yellow orange fireball traveling southeast seen by one witness in Los Angeles area.;2012-06-29 08:42:00;3-5 minutes;Yellow orange fireball traveling southeast seen by one witness in Los Angeles area. At approximately 8:42pm on June 29, 2012, I observed a fireball shape which had the appearance of bright orange and yellow outside my front living room window about 1-2 miles away.  It appeared to be above the tree line and move slowly in an eastern direction.  The city where I live is located in the urban Los Angeles area.  The &quotfireball&quot moved slowly and at that time I went outside to get a better view.   As I did, I noticed the fireball started to diminish in size although it was still moving slowly and heading in a southeast direction towards the mountains.  It gradually got smaller until it appeared to be the size of a dot and then totally &quotgo out&quot however, I could still detect some sort of craft traveling in a southeast direction.  At no time did I detect any sound.;33.9892760479043;-118.089002994012
