It was moving in a strange way up and down and then up and down. I noticed them because I was looking at some strange contrails in the sky on my way home that night. They were very strange. The contrails were at night lit up by the full moon. They were also very wide, low to the horison, and crisscrossed in loops, mt least 4 or more that I could see. Then the contrails got very wide and stayed in the sky a longer time than usual. Then the clear sky became full of many small clouds. Just filled the sky. Where did they come from I don't know. When the moonlight hit them, they looked different, like water looks when it shines on water with oil in it.;37.2218;-119.7459
