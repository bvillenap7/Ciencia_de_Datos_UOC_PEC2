My husband and I were in my parents jacuzzi when we spotted 4 white lights in the shape of a triangle w/1 red light at the top center of the craft. It was silently coming in our direction from the North East. As it approached us it hovered over us with no noise. It then quickly shined a red spot light on us and then proceeded to travel South West. The thing we thought was strange was that we were in the jacuzzi with no lights on and no lights on the patio either. We were both scared and totally speechless. We wanted to run in the house but we were like deer caught in headlights. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.2218;-119.7459
