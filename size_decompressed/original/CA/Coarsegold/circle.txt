Small white light pursuing large green disc or ball.;1975-07-01 09:00:00;12 seconds;Small white light pursuing large green disc or ball. Large round disk or ball 20 degrees above the southern horizon. Very decernable green but not a harsh green, traveling horizontally in a straight line to the west and followed by a much smaller craft that was a harsh white light. I thought the white lit craft might be a jet in pursuit. The green disc, or ball, was pulling away fron the white craft at about three times the speed of the white craft. They remained in sight for approx 12 seconds. I would estimate they were 3 to 5 miles from my location. Objects were too far away to hear any sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
