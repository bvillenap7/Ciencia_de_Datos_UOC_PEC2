Boomerang shape Green and red lights flashing over Ventura County, California;2011-02-07 19:30:00;15 min aprox;Boomerang shape Green and red lights flashing over Ventura County, California This is my daughters account of what we saw and she is 13.  I was looking out my window at 730 pm and saw a shape that looked kind of like a cylinder shape.  It had red and green flashing lights. It kinda looked like a gigantic flashing star.  It was going up and down and then it looked like it was coming towards us  and then I saw a outline of the front of it and it looked like a U shape and it was green.  It then moved to the west and then it stopped on top of a hill and  then  I saw a red flash for at least another 30 min and then went back inside.  The object didnt make a normal plane noise but it seemed like a swooshing noise was coming from it.  My mom and I looked for other planes that may make a noise, but there were only little planes and the sound was very different then that.;34.1851;-118.7706

The streak was unusual so it caught my attention. It unexpectedly fade away very rapidly.  Another object, or the same object I couldn't tell, appeared at a much closer distance. From what I can remember, this object had 3 orangish, reddish lights and some kind of energy flare that moved around the lights.  The object then seemingly split apart and 1 of the lights rapidly moved crossed the sky and created 2 faint streams like a comet tail but 2 of them.  After I followed the light that split from the object, I brought my field of Vision back to the original location where a large bright light, like a fire ball, was hovering in the sky.;34.1851;-118.7706
