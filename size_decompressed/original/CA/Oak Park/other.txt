Her report is listed above mine and as you will see , we saw things a little differently. She had told me there was a green light outside and asked what it was. I went outside and saw one large green light and 2 or 3 large red lights flashing and moving together. I didnt see a outline of any object just the lights and I didnt hear any sound. I tried to take a picture and video on my cell phone and I couldnt see anything on it to take , yet if I directed the camera to the moon or the other stars I could see those on my phone. It was a little creepy. The lights seemed to form the shape of a cylinder, moving slowly in a north west direction, after about 15 min  I saw it stop over a hill, looks like near the ocean coast. A red light continued to flash for at least another 30 min and then we went inside. I called the local news and asked them to see if anyone else reported seeing any ! unusual lights in the sky over southern calif tonite. Hoping someone else saw this.;34.1851;-118.7706
