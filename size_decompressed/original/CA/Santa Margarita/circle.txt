red lignt;2002-11-09 02:00:00;1 minute;red lignt I was living out on a 650 acre cattle ranch & taking my puppy out to potty when I looked up I saw a red circular light that looked like a shooting star falling down.  It was dropping down but then stopped & appeared to go back up & drop down again.  I didn't put too much thought into it & didn't want to be up all night frightened as I was there all alone.;35.3584;-120.2596
2 bright white-cricle lights that changed shapes under a cloud, before dusk (clear sky).  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch.  PD));2017-12-22 17:00:00;3-5 minutes;2 bright white-cricle lights that changed shapes under a cloud, before dusk (clear sky). Driving El. Camino Real westward towards Santa Margarita, CA. (approx. 4 miles away from town) during a busy traffic after work. Nearing dusk, clear bright darken blue sky with a noticeable large white cloud (west) that was a form of a circle with an opening in the middle with light-faded cloud beams coming out of it, below were 2-small very bright circles that seem to move/change shapes that got my attention to pull my car over and take pictures and a video.   After viewing the photos with enlargement, I can see the different formations that start as a circle, flattens out in a rectangle, and then to crescent shaped with opposite directions.  1-disappears before the other.  The large cloud appeared approx. 10 mins longer after the shapes were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Vandenberg AFB @ 5:26 p.m..  PD));35.3584;-120.2596
