disk with red and blue lights, wobbly, rubbery appearance in movement;2007-11-02 23:00:00;few minutes;disk with red and blue lights, wobbly, rubbery appearance in movement Three of us were in a car driving at 11pm. There were low clouds. We looked up into the sky and saw an object that seemed to be roundish, but it had a rubbery quality to it, as if you would take a dinner plate and wobble it. The object had red and blue lights, and I seem to recall seeing yellow at one point. The object hovered. When our car turned I tried to find the object again, and could not see it.  It was hard to tell how close it was to us, or how large it was, but from our perspective it did not seem to be very large. It was not a helicopter or anything weâ€™d ever seen before.;35.3584;-120.2596
A bright disk that was unmoving.;2021-04-10 20:09:00;Don't know;A bright disk that was unmoving. We didn't see it in person with our own eyes. We only saw it through the phone camera.  It was white with bright lights on underneath.  The picture was while we were eating dinner at night.;35.3584;-120.2596
