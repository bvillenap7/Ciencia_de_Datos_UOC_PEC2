It was me and my 5 year old son driving home from my cousins house in Baldwin Park CA.  I left his place around 9:30pm.  I hoped on the 605 freeway soutbound to get the 10 freeway east. Right when I entered the 10 freeway I noticed these three red lights forming a triangle.  I thought to my self what the heck is that my son immediately saw the lights too and was like, What's that, daddy?  I don't know,: I replied.  as we got closer to the lights I lowered my window to see if I could hear the propellers of a helicopter our the engines on a plane nope!  There was no noise coming from this lights.   As we continued to look at this red lights in amazement the two lights on the side moved forward and was no longer a triangle but a straight line.  As we passed the light I exited the freeway and was going to turn back so I could follow it and try to record it on my phone.  I exited the freeway and tried to make my way back I went over the 10 freeway on a bridge and could see the lights, the two lights on the side just dimmed away and the middle light was the only one left and was also dimming away.  I didn't want to follow it anymore so I went home. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.0862;-117.9641
