Four spheres flying in pairs apparently in formation swooped down and away and dissapeared in a flash.;2000-03-06 16:30:00;1 minute;Four spheres flying in pairs apparently in formation swooped down and away and dissapeared in a flash. I was watching a rescue helicopter fly above my parents house directly following a brief earthquake and noticed four interesting objects in the sky obove the saddleback mountains. They where close enouph for me to see that they where not the jets that normally fly in the area from the El Toro Marine base wich has been closed for a while now with no activity. These were round like a ball and I wouldn't say they where much larger than an f-14. They were flying south/east and went down slightly and it looked like they went suddenly north and just disappeared. I was amased and confused because I have never seen anything weird in the sky that I couldn't explain. They were round with no lights, grey in color. The sun was in a position where the top half of the body was lit and grey in color and the bottom half was darker as if in the shadow of the sun. That's all I know and i am interested in seeing if anyone else in my area had wittnessed this event.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Two yellow spheres rotating about each other (barrel rolls) moving right to left and vanishing.;2007-08-15 21:00:00;15 seconds;Two yellow spheres rotating about each other (barrel rolls) moving right to left and vanishing. I am writing this report because what I saw needs to be documented.  I have recounted the event to several people in casual setting without any sufficient explanation. I was unaware of such a place that I could record what I saw, that’s why I have never formally submitted what I saw. In 2007 I lived in Southern California in a town called Irvine. It’s a crowded city with lots of modern city development and is a “well off” expensive place to live. I was separated from my significant other and spent a lot of time waiting to pick up my daughter from her mother’s house so I would hang around different places until we could meet for me to pick her up. It was while waiting for my daughter one evening at a local park that I saw this UFO. Irvine has a park called “Colonel Bill Barber” park that is very well kept and has beautiful walking paths, tennis courts, and softball fields and playgrounds. I was walking between 9:00 and 10: PM at night in the summer time at a location on the walking path that was elevated 30 feet above the rest of the park. The walking path comes to a memorial on a hill where commemorative placards and a U.S. flag are displayed. From this point you can look out over the north side of the park with tennis courts to the right. The hill was not so high as to be able to see over the privacy netting of the tennis courts. While standing on this hill and facing north my attention was drawn to something out of the corner of my right eye. This area is well lit with amber colored lights on the parking lot and bright lights on the tennis courts. Some distance south of the tennis courts but within the boundary of the park two yellow orbs rotating in a counter clock wise rotation (as on the face of a clock) caught my eye. I stared at them in amazement and disbelief. They rotated keeping seemingly equal spacing from each other and constant rotational speed as these two yellow orbs moved from my right to left across in front and just above where I was standing. They gradually accelerated from the point where I first noticed them to the point just in front and to the left of me where they began to climb in altitude and vanish. The total distance the orbs traveled while I could see them was around 300ft and less than 100ft off the ground. I was feeling like I had just witnessed two spirits at play maybe! fascinated with the movements of the tennis ball at night? The orbs were moving with machine like precision so I also wondered if I had witnessed some type of energy from an engine source on some type of space craft. I also tried to reason if I was hallucinating?  There was no sound that I could remember other than the sound of tennis racquets striking tennis balls and the noise of cars and traffic on the nearby roads. I believe in extra terrestrial life. What I saw was unlike anything I have ever heard anyone describe except for sightings of colored orbs that have random movements.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
11 cylinder shaped aircraft with very bright blue lights;2013-07-15 01:00:00;7 minutes;11 cylinder shaped aircraft with very bright blue lights I was looking at the stars at night on my balcony when suddenly 11 of the stars started moving at impossibly fast speeds.  They were very bright.  The light was dark blue.   I noticed that they were a sphere shape.  They also had produced a beam sound.   I tried video taping it with my phone but for some reason my camera was malfunctioning.   After the event my phone battery went from 80% to 4%.   The entities disappeared into thin air.   When I started filming the ufos made very sharp turns and disappeared.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931

Then di;2014-11-07 21:30:00;10 seconds;Large round red ball, approx 200 ft. diameter.  Observed descending slowly behind a nearby hill, 7/8 obscured by hill when seen.  Then disappeared.  However, within a short time, it rose slowly again so that the very top appeared just over the hill and it expelled a very bright light momentarily, and what appeared to be sparks.  Then dropped out of sight.  I have previously seen UFOs twice in the form of orange balls, once during WW2, when I was the captain of a bomber returning from a raid over Germany.  It was  sitting on the water of the English Channel, and again about fifty years later, in Canada.  At that time I saw 2 UFOs identical to the one I had seen previously, sitting on the water of Horo Straight, about 1 1/2 miles from my home.  The internet has a report that I wrote about my UFO experiences.  If you Google Flt. Lt. Gordon Cammell R.A.F., you can read my report;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
I have pics of spherical metal objects.;2017-08-26 18:00:00;10 minutes;I have pics of spherical metal objects. After watching unacknowleged the other day, I took the opportunity to observe the sky while at work as a pool monitor.  A fewer hours later I saw an object appear from the distant sky.  As it became more visible I was able to see it more clearly, it seemed to suddenly split in to two aircraft.  I have pics.  Could it be to helicopters traveling in unison?;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
