It was early to m;2001-03-13 17:20:00;5 minutes;At the above date and approximate time, I was travelling northbound on Interstate 5 in south Orange County, CA area.  It was early to mid-dusk. The sky was cloudless. I observed two white jet trails, much shorter than what is normally seen and could just barely make out a craft at the front of each trail.  What caught my attention was that neither the jet trails nor the small objects in front(presumably an aircraft of some type) were moving.  They appeared to be absolutely stationary!!  It would be hard to estimate the altitude but I would guess 5-10 miles.  The craft/jet trails were positioned where it appeared that had the craft been moving, it would be travelling from north to south. As stated above the jet trails were white in color but were unusually short, much shorter than what is commonly seen.  From my perspective, they were both an inch to an inch an half in length. Additionally, they did not appear to disperse from the effects of the wind, as would normally be expected. The jet trails were not close together, separated by about 15-20 degrees horizontally. Since I was driving a vehicle, I had to divert my view briefly in order to drive safely.  At one point, I looked up and the plane/jet trail to my right completely disappeared!  I scanned the sky in the vicinity of where I had seen it and it was totally absent.   I had just seen it a few seconds previously. The object to my left was still visible. After about a minute, the object to my left then completely disappeared.  In both cases there were no remnants of the white jet trail as is normally seen. I am an investigator with an agency of the federal government, in my early 50s and married.  I have BS degree in Aeronautics. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness witnessed.  We suspect he may have been observing the contrails behind aircraft, which simply entered an area of the sky where contrail formation didn't occur.  However, given his background in aeronautics, we have to presume that he had allowed for that possibility.  PD));33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
the object emitted sparks from the side and rear and hit the earth at a fantastic speed.  no light was emitted upon impact.;2004-11-29 22:15:00;.2 sec;the object emitted sparks from the side and rear and hit the earth at a fantastic speed.  no light was emitted upon impact. Traveling north on the 405 freeway, getting off on the Alton, (Spectrum Mall off ramp)my eye caught a very quick streak of light decending on a near vertial fall to earth.  The object had a bright (white) center to it and it emitted sparks to the side and back of the object as it fell with an amazing speed.  It dissapeared below the horizan in the direction that would take it over Newport Beach in a line with Long Beach and then Point Magoo CA.  It could have landed in the water infront of the LAX airport. It looked like a sparkler being thrown through the air (exactly like)and not like any of the image I have seen on any asteroid or space junk as there was no tail  or illuminated glow around the object suggesting fire or great heat.  Just the sparking that did not form a tail or any sort behind the object.  Of course it was a dark night and if there was smoke I would have not seen it.  It happened so fast that if you were not ready there was no way to warn anyone to look that way or the other to catch a glimps of it.  It moved at an incredable speed and there was no glow from an impact when it hit earth.  It also had no curve to its flight as it went straight in.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
SILVER SHIMMERING OBJECT.  COULD NOT DEFINE SHAPE.  CAME TO COMPLETE STOP IN SKY.;2005-06-18 15:00:00;5-7 MINUTES;SILVER SHIMMERING OBJECT.  COULD NOT DEFINE SHAPE.  CAME TO COMPLETE STOP IN SKY. I AM AN AUTO SALESMAN.  I WAS STANDING IN OUR CAR LOT WHEN I SAW THIS BRIGHT SILVER OBJECT AT ABOUT 45 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON COMING TOWARD MY VICINITY.  I WATCHED IT FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE UNTIL IT WAS DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.  I CALLED TO ANOTHER SALESMAN TO COME AND SEE WHAT I WAS SEEING.  HE DID.  NEITHER OF US COULD GET ANY DEFINITIVE OBSERVATION AS TO SHAPE OR SIZE BECAUSE OF ITS ALTITUDE. WHEN IT WAS OVERHEAD OF US IT CAME TO COMPLETE STOP.  IT STAYED IN THIS POSITION FOR ABOUT ANOTHER TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND THEN STARTED GOING STRAIGHT UP.  WE WATCHED IT UNTIL WE COULDN'T SEE IT ANY LONGER.  MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT IT WAS A SILVER METALIC OBJECT THAT GLINTED AS IT MOVED.  SKY WAS COMPLETELY CLEAR.  NO CLOUDS. VISABILITY UNLIMITED.  NO WINGS.  NO TAIL. NO SOUND.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
3 crafts hovering in Irvine,Ca close to the 405 freeway for about 10mins.;2010-03-17 16:40:00;10;3 crafts hovering in Irvine,Ca close to the 405 freeway for about 10mins. 3 crafts were hovering in Irvine over the mountain next to the 405 freeway at 4.40pm on wednesday,March 17th,2010.  1 of the crafts was a little more active then the other 2.  They were about to leave and started traveling back over the mountain slowly and in a blink second they made a mad dash in the opposite direction towards the freeway.  They slowed down again and were hovering for a few minutes.  We were traveling on the freeway and as a  freeway overhead blocked our view for a few seconds they were gone after that.  It was a pretty cool experience :);33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
two small red lights going across the skay and never faiding.;2010-07-04 20:00:00;20:45;two small red lights going across the skay and never faiding. I was at home and my husband is a non believer, he went to take out the trash and called me to look out the window... when I did there was 2 red lights very far away to the south.  No!  NOT fireworks... they we're moving very fast one in the front was in a straight line and the one right in back was, what seemed to be bouncing up and down behind it.  My husband saw them because he noticed my neighbor looking up with his mouth open.  When my husband saw what the guy was looking at, he called me... he was in awe!  The lights went accross the sky, never faiding and they would take turns going straight and bouncing up and down.  I tried to get my video camara, but the image was never captured.  The 2 red lights were too far away for my low pixal in my cam to capture anything. Not sure what they were... but it was not normal, that much I can say.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931

Continuous shrieking sound.;2013-04-29 03:00:00;1-2 minutes;Around 3:00 am on 04/29/13, I was abruptly awakened by an incredibly loud shrieking noise. It was continuous and never changed tones or pitches.  It was so loud that the instant I was awakened, I covered my ears.  I had a hard time even moving because it was so loud.  I did not open my eyes.   This loud noise continued for about 1-2 minutes straight.  I feel like I saw a flash of bright light, maybe white or yellow in color right as the noise began however I cannot confirm the color as I did not open my eyes.   Then it sounded like whatever was creating the noise drove/flew/etc away but still making the continuous shrieking sound but it got fainter and fainter as it went further and further away.   My bedroom is on the 3rd floor of my condo and my bed is positioned exactly the same height as the window.  My head is right in front of the window.  I always keep my window opened.  The sound that I heard felt like it was literally right outside of my window.   I have a house ! and fire alarm however this sound was not either of those.  It was a sound I have never heard before and still have not heard since then.  I don’t remember anything past this point but woke up the next morning with a very strange almost nauseating feeling.   The next morning, I asked my sisters if they heard that loud shrieking noise and they both said “no”.  I don’t know what it was but it was the most unusual and strange feeling and sound I have ever experienced.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
