Fast light in sky moving horizontal, and too fast for normal military of commercial traffic;2005-11-01 17:40:00;5 sec;Fast light in sky moving horizontal, and too fast for normal military of commercial traffic I observed a light that was travelling horizontal to the ground at a high rate of speed from north to south toward John Wayne airport.  Slower than a falling star, but much faster that commercial air traffic and faster than normal military jets.   There was some jet noise, but not nearly as loud as most jets, there were also some commercial jets in the area.   My conclusion is that this was either a very low flying, very fast,  and very quiet military jet or ???.  It was flying in airspace that is between the two typical patterns for planes landing at John Wayne airport, but in the same general direction.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
A light in the night sky that wobbled, changed direction and zoomed off at an astonishing rate of speed;2008-08-06 21:30:00;about 6 or 7 seconds;A light in the night sky that wobbled, changed direction and zoomed off at an astonishing rate of speed I was sitting in my backyard sipping a soda pop on a reclining chair with my head facing the sky.  I was looking at the stars and suddenly noticed a yellowish light which appeared to be heading down toward earth because as it moved it grew slightly larger.  My first thought was that it was a shooting star. It had no flashing beacon or tail.   As soon as the thought occurred about the shooting star, the light seemed to hesitate for a split second and wobble slightly.  It suddenly and I mean SUDDENLY changed course about 30 degrees and headed due west toward Los Angeles at an astonishing high rate of speed. I tried to follow it and dropped my soda can in the process but it I lost it behind a palm tree. It was just going too fast to follow.  Of course I do not know what it was, but I do know that it wasn't a shooting star because it changed direction. It wasn't an airplane or helicopter because there was no flashing beacon. It was not a satellite because it was going too fast and changed direction.  Commercial airlines fly over my house on a regular basis.  They fly over at about 10,000 feet altitude.  These jets are traveling about 300 to 400 miles per hour. If the light that I saw was at this same altitude, it was traveling easily in excess of 10,000 miles per hour.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Two Large Lights with bright cloud formations in darkness.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2017-12-22 17:30:00;15 minutes;Two Large Lights with bright cloud formations in darkness. Irvine CA at the 405 and 133.  Two large lights moving through the sky.  Missed the starting point but there is a brightly lit cloud trail from what looks like a start location.  One light moving west shining a wide bright light back towards the following light.  The following light was emitting what could only be described as light “bursts” in a circular pattern around the light.  Both moved away in the same direction then I lost sight of the following light.  The lead light kept going west towards the ocean and moved out of site.  The cloud pattern it left behind remained bright and lit until it dissipated. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
I was in bed sleeping and some strange noise woke me. It sounded like a loud bass hum.;2018-05-17 03:30:00;30 minutes;I was in bed sleeping and some strange noise woke me.  It sounded like a loud bass hum. When I opened my eyes there was what looked like a small star in the sky at about 80 degrees. It looked like it was about 5 to 10 miles away.  The object was moving in place in small movements side to side and up and down. The lights were brighter than a small star.  The object was moving in place, but moving in a downward trajectory.  When it was at about 20 degrees I lost track.  It was up for more than 30 minutes.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Star-type object began slowly moving across sky and then suddenly vanished;2020-08-03 20:55:00;12 seconds;Star-type object began slowly moving across sky and then suddenly vanished On the evening of Monday, August 3, 2020 my son and I stepped outside to enjoy a glorious full moon rising above the trees down our street.  At 8:55pm the skies were clear and the temperature was 70° F.  My son noticed what appeared to be star above us beginning to move across the sky in a due easterly directly. To be clear, this wasn’t an airplane and didn’t emit the standard FAA blinking light patterns typically associated with commercial aircraft.  We both observed the object. As it moved across the sky, I mentioned to my son, “that doesn’t appear to be an airplane.” He agreed. What we both observed can best described is an object resembling a star moving across the night sky, however it definitely wasn’t a shooting star.  After approximately ten seconds the object began fading in luminosity, not due to its increasing distance, but as if it was intentionally being faded by a dimmer mechanism. It then vanished completely .;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
