Right before that I had been experiencing lots of difficulties on my cell phone in an area where I had never before had difficulties carrying a conversation on the phone (ie: cut off, no tone);33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Circular object seen in Irvine, CA;2007-10-07 21:45:00;5 minutes;Circular object seen in Irvine, CA There have been a number of Irvine, CA UFO reports all reporting the same object.  All other reports of this UFO have the similar characteristics.  Its basically a circular disk with blue lights on the the bottom.  It weaves around the sky in a circular manner and climbs and dives very quickly.  I saw this object near the UCI campus towards the south east.  This is the second time my girlfriend and I have seen this object.   My girlfriend and I are both well educated, and although we don't believe in UFOs in the alien sense of the word we do agree that this object is certainly unidentified.  I was able to take about 5 pictures as well as a 1 minute movie file with my low quality digital camera.  Please contact me by email, and I will send them to you.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
UFO sighting, 2 objects, May 11, 2013 approximately 10:30pm, Irvine, CA;2013-05-11 22:30:00;15 minutes;UFO sighting, 2 objects, May 11, 2013, approximately 10:30pm, Irvine, CA I spotted two very distinct objects in the night sky over Irvine, CA while looking eastward from my northeast-facing bedroom window. Unfortunately, I did not have any camera equipment or binoculars available.  I could not see the shape of the craft, but the lights appeared to be large (but different sizes), different colors of red, white, and yellow. There were approximately 5 to 8 different lights on each object.  The red light appeared to be the largest, but there were more of the yellow lights surrounding it.  I could not say for certain if the lights were flickering, but they did not appear to blink or pulse.   The lights formed an oval shape.  Both of the objects appeared identical to me.  They appeared at first to be very small objects, at least a few miles to the East, traveling steadily West (towards my location).  I can only estimate speed to be somewhat faster than a helicopter, but slower than a commercial jet.   The entire sighting was probably a full 15 minutes as the obj! ects approached my location before their ascent and disappearance.  There seemed to be a noticeable increase in speed as the objects ascended, but I can't really say for sure.  I did not hear any noise from the objects.  Everything was very quiet.  The objects followed a very similar (perhaps identical) westward flight path just a little beyond my location (about 8 miles from the Orange County airport) at an estimated altitude between 20,000 to 25,000 feet, and then ascending so high that the bright colored lights completely disappeared into the night sky. I feel confident that the objects ascended because they were getting smaller and smaller until I could no longer see them.  And I also feel confident that the objects would have needed to be higher than 35,000 feet to completely disappear because commercial aviation lights are still visible with my own eyes (at night while traveling at typical, long distance cruising altitudes).;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
