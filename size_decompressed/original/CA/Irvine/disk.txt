I thought it might be landing lights of an aircraft, but it just hovered in the air. The shape was disk or saucer shaped, and it appeared in the horizontal orientation- like a flat oval. The light became very bright- like arc welding or a flash of lightning when all of a sudden, the object shot off at the speed of light at I would say about a 45 degree angle. It was much faster than any aircraft known to man. Although it did rise straight up slightly, it definitely was not a Harrier. I also experienced a loss of time and location. I do not know if the actual date is correct or even the city in which it occurred. I think others may have pulled over on the freeway to see it. I have always accepted the idea of other intelligent life forms in our galaxy or elsewhere in outerspace. The incident only strengthened my belief in UFO's and extraterrestrials. I have since had a(n) experience(s) that I  thought I was under a very bright, hot light and individuals were examining me and making strange noises. I have also had episodes since then of seeing imagery of everyday scenes when my eyes are shut that appear holigraphic and 3-D. I don't know what this is, but some tell me it's called remote viewing. This may or may not have anything to do with my UFO sighting, but my guess is it does.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931

close encounters looking and very close it hovered and moved in abnormal directions.;2007-02-24 21:00:00;20+ min;close encounters looking and very close it hovered and moved in abnormal directions. My husband a I were driving down Irvine Bvld. at 9:50 pm and made a right on jefferey.  Thats when we saw it at around 30 to 50 above our car.It was a disc/saucer thing with lights that moved around the outer edege and it whizzed past us without a sound.We pulled over as well as others to see whats was going on.It hovered over a field moving side to side making a low humming vibrarion.At this point it was maybe 3 to 400 feet away,it then turned vertically and shot toward the sky.then once again  went horzontal and started moving in a triangle formation . at that point my husband who I might mention is a commerical pilot said maybe we should call someone.All of a sudden this thing dropped like a falling star towards the earth and stopped within feet of the ground, hovered still vertical,and then righted itself and started moving side to side once again.we thought it was maybe kids playing a prank but now having thought about it more we are not sure what happened that night on a dark road.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Disk-Like object  with lights west of John Wayne Airport;2007-10-13 22:40:00;<1 minute;Disk-Like object  with lights west of John Wayne Airport Disk like object darting up and down in the sky. It would go side to side, gently turn and dart back up to the sky. I often watch the airplanes leave John Wayne Airport, and this was the approximate size of average passenger plane. It had lights evenly spaced along sides. The whole experience was strange, but what seemed odd to me is it darted toward the ground and disappeared beyond a hill approxametly over Costa mesa/Santa Ana.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Extended Duration of UFO Sighting  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting caused by model airplane.  PD));2008-10-09 21:46:00;00:45;Extended Duration of UFO Sighting ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the witness for the report, and we commend him for his having been able to determine what the cause of the sighting was.  Please see below.  PD)) From 9:46PM until 10:22PM, 2 unidentified objects were witness by myself seemingly dancing in the cloud covered night skies.  These 2 objects were circular, with lights ringing the outside perimeter of their circumference.  Their movement was eratic, ranging from hovering, to then quickly darting about while flipping and rotating. As the objects flipped in abrupt directional changes, the top of the disk appeared to be a dark metallic.  The lights surrounding the craft would ocassionally flash brightly.  It appeared as if the objects were ringed with 8 white lights, and 1 larger red one which by watching the movements of the objects, would indicate being the 'front'. The objects were visible this entire time just barely under the low slung clouds.  They would dart in and out of the cloud cover, and then stay for extended periods below the clouds.  It appeared that their relative distance from the observers did not change that much, only altitude. Photos will be forthcoming. Observers were:  Myself:  Corporate President My Girlfriend:  Mathematics Teacher  (Irvine High School) Neighbor:  Custom Home Developer Neighbors Wife 2 Visiting Relatives of Neigbors 1 Other new neighbor, apprx 25 yrs of age, name and occupation unknown ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Apparently, this report is in all likelihood a false alarm.  I called the Irvine Police Dept and they stated that there is a local resident that conducts experiments from time to time that have in the past generated similar reports of UFO's.  They continued to state that he normally reports in first, before conducting these experiments, but that tonight he did not.  However, the are reasonably certain that this is probably the source of our observations. Given the late hour, I will not press my neighbors to compile the photos and video tonight, however, will retain the information awaiting you verification of this mundane event.  If for any reason this was not what actually happened, all materials will be available for you. Thanks!;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Disc hovering at a southernmost tilt west of NB I-405 at Irvine Medows CA;2008-10-15 12:00:00;10 seconds;Disc hovering at a southernmost tilt west of NB I-405 at Irvine Medows CA My wife and I were traveling north on I-405 - approx midday.  Before Culver exit, I glanced to the west and briefly saw a nearby tilted disc hovering directly over the northern part of Irvine's Preservation Area. Disc appeared reasonably large - maybe 40 feet in length, but viewing perspective made it appear very thin. The disc appeared to be very 'real' and solid in nature I did not see any form of glowing or radiation of bright color. Object was gray/brown - I believe. It was hovering and completely/effortlessly static. Notably, it was tilting distinctly to its southernmost side. I viewed the object from the freeway, but could not alert my wife's attention to it quickly enough before a freeway bridge and trees obscured it from my view. I pulled off the Culver exit and drove west over the freeway to attempt a better view, feeling sure that we would be able to view something explainable, but the object was no longer visible. I often question if I had actually seen the object, but cannot account for how I could imagine the length, flatness and angular titling of the disc if I had indeed been confused or subject to some kind of illusion. Date and precise time are approximate, since I could not substantiate the sighting with other witnesses and questioned the 'reality' of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931

Four shiny objects flying in close formation with one breaking formation and flying straight up.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-27 12:17:00;30 seconds;Four shiny objects flying in close formation with one breaking formation and flying straight up. I was travelling north on Interstate 5 just south of the Irvine Spectrum and saw what I thought was a plane pulling a banner near the old Verizon Amphitheater.  The banner was towards the north and the plane was towards the south.  I then realized that the objects were actually moving north towards the Irvine Spectrum so the banner had to be something else unless it was being pushed by the plane.  The formation then crossed Interstate 5 heading east.  The formation consisted of four separate objects flying in close proximity.  The objects were shiny and appeared disc-like.  The front three objects were very close to each other the forth was trailing behind.  Once the objects crossed the interstate one of the object in the group of three broke formation and went straight up very quickly.  I then lost sight of the remaining three object.
