Fireball with tail of sparks over Orange County skies;2009-01-18 17:30:00;2 seconds;Fireball with tail of sparks over Orange County skies I was merging onto the 5 freeway north when I saw (very clearly as the light was still out) a light in the sky. It looked like something entering the atmosphere as it seemed to be traveling much slower than a shooting star you might see at night. It had a tail of what appeared to be sparks. I am sure lots of people on the freeway saw it but I can't find anything about it online. It appeared for only a couple of seconds before disappearing in a north east direction. Here is a google maps link of where I was and the direction I was facing when it happened:  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=irvine+transportation+center&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=38.638819,78.837891&ie=UTF8&ll=33.670443,-117.754984&spn=0,359.972599&z=16&layer=c&cbll=33.670634,-117.755051&panoid=W8YhBR5WwkXRCOxFgaPvhw&cbp=12,346.4568740764644,,0,-10.251370399373544;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
