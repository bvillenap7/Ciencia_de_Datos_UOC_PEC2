Objects seemed in concert, almost as if joined at a center point yet they flew independently. As they moved, they appeared and reappeared behind cloud cover. The objects moved within the same area of the sky. After several minutes, the crafts then made a movement away from their location and vanished.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
White Lights in a large circle over UC Irvine, Campus.;2007-04-15 22:30:00;1-2 minutes;White Lights in a large circle over UC Irvine, Campus. Driving home, to my right i saw a circlular shaped ring of lights, about 5-6 feet in diameter, with white lights around the entire circumference. They were a constant light, not blinking or anything. the object was about, 7 stories in the air (it was near a parking structure) and was hovering for a few seconds, then proceded to move towards my direction then away from me. For a few moments everything became very still, and quiet, my radio stopped working and for a slpit second everything became dark. The object then floated in a swaying mannor floating up towards the sky then disappered. It occured around 10pm, dark black sky, with no stars around and could not be mistaken for a plane or helecopter since there were no flashing/blinking or colored lights and was silent. It occoured near UC Irvine, near the corner of Bridge and Campus. I only obsereved one of them. Other people in their cars slowed down to view this amazing sighting, and people on the streets stopped dead in their tracks and pointed upwards. I feel different, i can explain how i do, but i do not feel how i did seconds before viewing this UFO.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Circle of blue lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Excellent report from an individual with engineering background.  PD));2007-04-17 22:00:00;5;Circle of blue lights On the evening of April 17, 2007 I went out onto my front yard for a smoke before bed.  It was about 9.55 p.m. PST.  My house faces NNE.  The planes approaching Orange County Airport approach my house from the NNE and go past North to my left to the NW to land at OC approximately 8-9 miles away.  Normally I can see the planes unaided and hear them as they descend. This night was overcast so I could hear some but not see them as they broke cloud cover once they had passed my house.  As I was standing on my driveway, I saw some blue light aloft to the North moving back and forth, almost flittering like a moth.  I initally thought it was a police helicopter.  This is a well populated suburb community and it's not unusual to see one of those things circling around.  What I thought was unusual was that it was moving more in a quick back and forth movement instead of what is usually seen as a slow circle.  Also, I could not see a strong search light or hear an engine sound.  It appeared that the object was 1-2 miles away.  I thought this was odd so I retrieved a pair of quality 20x binoculars that I keep hanging on a coat rack inside the front door.  What I saw raised the hair on the back of my neck.  These lights seemed to consist of a row of individual blue lights that first were traveling to the left.  As the object reversed direction, the object appeared to be first an ellipse and then a full circle that had maybe 24-30 individual blue lights around the perimeter.  It then traveled to the right and reversed the process again forming a circle at the end of its travel when reversing direction.  Its travel in each direction was maybe 3-5 seconds.  There were definitely no red/green port/starboard lights, only the blue perimeter lights and no strobe lights.  I watched this object for 2-3 minutes and I believe it was out there longer than that since I noticed it there soon after I initially stepped outside.  It finally disappeared into the cloud cover.  I waited a few minutes to see if it would come back but it was gone.  I don't have a working video camera and probably would not have had time to get it if I had.  I don't really want my name associated with this.  I'm a 55 year old engineer and I've never really believed that something like this could not be identified, but I have never seen anything like this.  I used to fly small aircraft so I have some experience with the shapes and types of various small planes.  BTW, the only thing I drank that night was a cup of tea and a glass of Metamucil so I was completely aware of what was happening.  If you would like to contact me, please respond to my e-mail address.  If you would like to speak to me, let me know and I'll call you, or respond to you with a phone number to reach me.  What I would find crazy about this is if no one else saw it.  As said, although the community is quiet and most people are in bed or in home at that hour, there are enough people around here that someone else should have seen this to collaborate.  If you would to contact be, do so at the e-mail listed in witness information. ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome reports from others who may have been witness to this object.

Blue circle lights over Irvine campus;2007-05-09 22:50:00;5 minutes;Blue circle lights over Irvine campus My girlfriend and I were driving down University Ave and Campus Ave when all of the sudden I saw some flashing blue lights through the clouds toward the University of California Irvine Mesa Court dorms, but thought nothing of it because it is a fairly brightly lit area. Then all of the sudden she said Hey do you see that?! That thing in the sky!  I thought nothing of it until I looked up again toward the sky and saw two bright blue circle of lights flying around the sky. We turned into the Mesa Court dorms' parking lot to catch a better look at it but as we turned around back, our view was obstructed by the buildings themselves. By the time we came around the corner and into an open area the lights were gone already. To be honest, I was really doubtful of what we saw because I do not believe in those type of things- UFO and all, but I searched on Google and came across this site that reported two other reports of seeing circle lights in the sky. She said that she saw two flying circles one above the other circling the buildings high above. I was driving at around 50MPH, passing by the wild life reservation area toward the university campus when we witnessed this. Did anyone else see it?  You can e-mail me if you saw it also.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
A Circular object with bright green lights hovering over near UC Irvine campus.;2007-06-10 22:30:00;5 minutes;A Circular object with bright green lights hovering over near UC Irvine campus. It was on Sunday night around 10:30 PM. I was sitting on the couch and watching TV in my apartment. I noticed something unusual hovering outside. I looked over the window and I saw a circular or oval shape object with small green or blue lights around it. Then I asked my roommate to come over to the window and she also saw it. The flying object was floating without any noise and making circular motion. It was moving slowly toward northeast direction.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931

It was about 6-20 feet in diameter, spinning and hovering At about 10:30pm PST, my girlfriend and I were driving home from dinner about 5 miles away from our residence.  On the way home, I noticed a flying circular disk with bright lights on the bottom outer rim.   It was about 6-20 feet in diameter, spinning and hovering from side to side, less than 50 yards from the ground.  I was about 100 yards from the object when I noticed it and I froze.  My girlfriend asked me what was wrong, and I told her to turn around at the next street after we had passed it.  As we drove up the hill, I got a closer look and saw that there was blue and red lights spinning around the outer rim at about 1 revolution every 5 seconds.  I told my girlfriend to make a right into the Strawberry Farms Golf Course to take a closer look, but she refused and we had to drive another mile before we could take another glimpse at it.  When we returned, the object had flown about 1/2 a mile away on top of a hill, and was very hard to spot.  I was going to take a picture, but could not get a clear shot from a moving vehicle, especially with a camera phone.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931

So my friends and I went to see a summer thriller at midnight at the Irvine Spectrum on July 3rd 07.  The place was packed with a lot of people cause it was the day before the Fourth of July.  As we were walking towards the ticket booth at the entrance of the Theatre we noticed that everyone was looking up at the sky..taking pictures and using their cells to capture what we saw up in the sky.  It was a Circular object..with pinkish/green lights (about 5)   flying over in the night sky.  At first I thought it was a helicopter or plane since its in the direction of the John Wayne Airport...but the swift hoovering and flight pattern was too quick and very unusual.  It definitely caught my friends and my attention, as well as all the people there at the Spectrum mall in irvine.  It then descended in such a weird and fast fashion and dissappeared behind the buildings.  I haven't heard anything about it... and although I don't believe in this sort of stuff...it left my friends and myself wondering... I feel so cliche saying this, but..I Am certain I saw a unidentified flying object.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Floating circular object seen over Irvine Spectrum;2007-07-07 00:00:00;10 mins;Floating circular object seen over Irvine Spectrum After exiting the Irvine Spectrum movie theater through the front by the ticket office we saw several people looking upward into the sky. The couple we were with as well as my girlfriend and I saw one object floating over the area in a hover pattern. It was circular in shape and had several blue lights surrounding it. I am very skeptical about UFO's however both the group I was with and a large number of people (about 50) were staring into the sky wondering what the object was. We did not hear the sound of a helicopter and do not believe it was an airplane due to its ability to hover and the tight circles it was doing in the sky. After about 10 minutes the object floated about the cloud layer and was not seen. There were people there taking pictures of the image and most of us were dumbfounded by what we saw.

Circular UFO with Blue lights seen near 405 S at Bake Pkwy exit.;2007-11-12 19:00:00;5 minutes;Circular UFO with Blue lights seen near 405 S at Bake Pkwy exit. I was driving home from work tonight on the 405 south and as I was exiting the fwy at Bake Pkwy a blue light caught my eye.  I looked to my right and I saw a flat circular object with blue lights around it hovering over close to the fwy.  When I exited the fwy I pulled to the side of the road and watched it hover close to the fwy.  It looked as though it was spinning because it was wobblig.  It moved up, then down, then started to move North towards the Irvine Spectrum.  All of a sudden, the object dropped down like it fell from the sky then shot up into the air and disappeared.  I started to freak out becuase I knew what I saw so I stayed a minute to see if it would come back.  All of a sudden the object appeared to drop from the sky and was wobbling and moving in all different directions, I decided to drive the rest of the way home real fast to grab my video camera but by the time  I got back (10 minutes later) to see if I can catch a video of it, it was gone.  Whatever it was, was not from this world.  The lights were a silvery blue and were in a perfect circle.  The object was perfectly circular and extremely flat.  I will never forget what I saw.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Ring of blue light flying in physics-defying pattern around Irvine Spectrum.;2007-12-19 20:30:00;20 minutes;Ring of blue light flying in physics-defying pattern around Irvine Spectrum. Circular disc about the size of a helicopter (size cannot be determined, only its location of flight is compared to a helicopter that flew past that region) gliding in circles, dipping and gliding back upwards, gliding down towards the unseen hillside. Re-emerges a few minutes later to continue its erratic physics-defying gliding pattern. Moves at a consistent speed, and moves easily from the ground to very high into the sky. Unidentified craft has only two lighted rings of blue on its underside, thinner ring outside, thicker ring inside, and seems to have a reflective surface. One blinking light was observed. The object seems to emit some motorized humming sound, confirmed by two other witnesses. The craft flew for approximately 10 - 15 minutes on the other side of the 405 freeway from the Irvine Spectrum's Nordstrom parking lot (where the craft was being observed from). 5 minutes later the craft was observed to be hovering over the other side of the Irvine Spectrum, only to dip behind one of the corporate buildings (WTBG Building if memory serves correct) and disappear, observed from the Macy's parking lot.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Two objects seen in sky near Irvine, California.;2008-01-31 21:50:00;1 hour;Two objects seen in sky near Irvine, California. This happened on Thursday night 01.31.08 at around 9:50pm.  I saw what appeared to be two small dots hover up into the sky.  I was in the industrious part of Irvine where there are many buildings, so the horizon line was out of sight to me.  These two dots appeared to be disks.  One was more aggresive than the other and they would glow a very bright blue/white(similar to those new headlights cars have nowadays) and a few times turned very red(just like a brake light).  Four other of my co-workers witnessed this as well.  About one hour later, another co-worker who moves our trucks for us(we work in a warehouse) saw the objects as well. I work nights and our shift takes lunch from 9:30 to 10pm.  When I saw these objects I waved a co-worker over to see them.  I also work near an airport, John Wayne, and remember thinking that those dots were planes.  But they were far to high in the sky and they seemed to be rising and hovering in the same area.  As stated before, they would glow extremely bright.  The dots looked more like a disk from time to time, mainly when the would glow brighter.  Seriously, I have no explanation what they could be.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931

I was exiting the freeway when I looked up and saw a small ring of blue lights.  It caught my eye as it was unlike any light configuration I had ever seen on an aircraft (there is an airport near by and we have a lot of heliocopter traffic, so I am familiar with standard aircraft lights).  I watched it for as long as I could until the turn of the freeway off ramp took it out of my field of vision.  I saw it for approximately 10 seconds and in that time it did not appear to move nor did any lights flash (such as flashing red and blue lights that is on standard aircraft).;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931

It was about 50 ft above the ground.  The white lights around the object seemed to have a blue tint around them.  The object made something like a buzzing sound as it hovered over my townhome.  It looked as if it was spinning in place as it hovered there for about 5 minutes.  I looked outside my window to see if anyone was controlling a toy but no one was around.  Then it flew west toward the foothills at a very fast speed.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Circluar shaped object outlined with blue lights flying over Irvine, CA;2008-05-08 10:15:00;10 mins;Circluar shaped object outlined with blue lights flying over Irvine, CA I know John Wayne Airport is really close by but it has a curfew, and it's not that close enough to make the planes look that big when they take off. This thing was a perfect disc shape. It was a saucer, it had very bright blue lights that outlined the sides, it varied in speed from practically hovering to way too fast for any helicopter to ever catch up, and it even flew on it's side and while changing it's angles. And it was either really big, or really really close. And it just stayed flying around in the same general area for a long time, five or ten minutes. I know helicopters don't do that and if they did, they would have a searchlight looking for something. This thing looked like it was just having fun flying around as if it was joyriding. And if it were a helicopter it would make that continuous droning helicopter sound. I think this thing was actually really close because I did hear it make some noise every now and then, depending on if it was flying towards me or away or if it was flying flat or on its side. And it definitely did not sound like a helicopter. It made this sort of high pitched buzzing sound. Sort of like those toy planes, but a little different. When I first saw it, I was actually walking back to my dorm hall on the UC Irvine campus. Judging by the area where it stayed flying for the ten minutes or so that I saw it, I know I couldn’t have been the only one to have seen it. It was only around 10 o’clock at night and I would guess that it was flying somewhere in the direction of the 405 Freeway or the Irvine Spectrum Mall somewhere anyone could get a good, unobstructed view of it. But I went up to my room, and the window of my room faces the same area where it had been flying when I had initially seen it outside, and it was still flying around for another few minutes. And when it went away, it didn't fly off into space, it looked like it was flying downwards to earth and it disappeared from my view behind the other dorm halls and trees.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Blue/White Circular UFO near UC Irvine's Mesa Court at 9:30 p.m. on 5/19/08;2008-05-19 21:30:00;10 mins;Blue/White Circular UFO near UC Irvine's Mesa Court at 9:30 p.m. on 5/19/08 I am a student at UC Irvine living in the Mesa Court Undergraduate Housing near the intersection of Campus and University Ave. I reported about a similar, if not the same UFO that I had witnessed 11 days ago flying in the exact same place as tonight. I was in my dorm room on the third floor which faces Parking Lot 5, when I heard the same sound that I had heard a week and a half prior coming from the UFO. Again it sounded similar to that of a toy plane, but I think it’s buzz is a little bit higher pitched than a toy plane. I looked out of my window and there it was, the UFO outlined with blue lights, flying closer to my housing community. I ran outside, this time determined to get a video of it, but when I went outside, I realized that I wasn’t wearing my glasses so it just looked like a small thin line of blurry blue lights. So I ran back up to my room, grabbed my glasses, and ran back outside. I could see it clearly now, flying overhead like last time, in what seemed like the direction of the 405 freeway. I ran towards the parking lot so that I could get a better video of it, but unfortunately, all that my video camera was able to pick up was a spot of blue light. There were other students in the parking lot also. There were a couple of guys by their car, one of them I heard saying to his friend, “It’s a UFO, it has to be.” After all, it was in plain sight, flying fairly low to the ground, probably no higher than one of those privately owned propeller planes that I see a lot of flying around Irvine. I’ve read other UFO reports from people who have seen them near the UC Irvine campus and it seems like there are two common sightings: one has blue lights and the other has white lights. From my dorm room, as well as when I saw it without my glasses, it looked like it had blue lights. But when I got a closer look in the parking lot, it seemed to have white lights. Maybe the lights look different depending on how close you are. But the lights themselves looked slightly different this time t! hey didn ’t necessarily look like clean rectangles that outlined the sides like last time, instead they seemed to have an edge, sort of like a cross between circles and triangles, that outlined the edge. And there seemed to be some sort of a flickering light underneath, within its circular shape that flickered every now and then. It stayed flying in the same place for about ten minutes, flying at different angles as well as hovering in place for a few seconds at one point. I also saw a helicopter that seemed to be flying towards its direction. After a few minutes, I ran to another spot near the parking lot to hopefully get a better quality video of it but a few seconds after I got there, it slowly started flying away behind the trees and apartments and disappeared from my sight. There were another couple of guys in the parking lot who obviously saw it. One of them was waiting in the parking lot while his friend ran across the street when there were no cars coming and tried to run up the hill where the apartments are located to see where it was going. I doubt he was able to locate where it had gone because he came back a couple minutes later looking a little disappointed so was I that I couldn’t get a better video of it.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931

Golden Ball in SKy;2010-07-04 21:00:00;2 minutes;Golden Ball in SKy At your prompting on Coast to Coast this evening, I will report what I saw.   I was in Irvine, CA, visiting my sister and brother-in-law.  We were having a lovely evening and playing cards and had not decided to go watch fireworks.  When the fireworks began, we decided to take a break and hustled so we would be able to see them. I was in the back seat of the car and looking out what I believe to be toward the northwest.  I saw a golden globe hovering in the sky, not very high but not low either, like the height of fireworks.  I asked if the fireworks were over that way.  They were not in that direction but in the opposite direction. I looked and saw it again.  I mentioned to them that I think I was seeing a UFO but since it was 4th of July, I chalked it up to possible fireworks.  I did mention it again on the way home it had left an impression. It was gold, not bright gold but pale yet had a definite brightness that seemed to be contained in some way.  I had some sense that it may have been spinning.  I felt it had some purpose and that it was doing something. It continued to be on the back of my mind throughout the evening.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931

Approximately 2 hours ago i saw a bright orange ball and streak moving at a very high speed in Orange County CA. I was traveling South on Laguna Canyon Road which runs in a general north south direction. The orange streak was moving close to my direction, about SSE, perhaps 190 to 200 degrees on the compass. It was notable for several reasons. It was moving extremely fast. It was almost a pumpkin orange, not at all like the burst of light from a meteor. Appeared to be low, maybe several hundred yards above me, although this is my best guess, have no way to quantify that altitude. Sincerely,;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
