3 rust-colored, stealth fighter-shaped UFOs.;2001-06-27 06:55:00;2 minutes;3 rust-colored, stealth fighter-shaped UFOs. 3 rust-colored objects, shaped much like the stealth fighter.  They hovered just east of the 405 freeway near the University exit.  I saw them during my morning commute to work.  I lost sight of them as I drove behind some trees.

Unknown W shaped objects;2005-07-15 21:30:00;3 minutes;Unknown W shaped objects My friend and I were sitting on a bench by the north lake in Woodbridge.  It was dark, but there were low clouds and you could see pretty well under them, because of the reflection of the city lights. I saw at first what appeared to be smoke or two balloons. The color was dark brown or black. After about a minute or so it became apparent that they were something different. The way they moved was unusual. I told my friend to look at them. I thought that maybe these were birds flying in formations. When the objects got closer to us it became obvious that they were not birds. They were moving very gracefully, almost like two giant pterodactyls. They were not moving their “wings”, but hovering and did not make any sound. My friend got a little scared and asked me what I think these things are. She is a strict Christian and does not believe in UFOs or anything like that. After about a minute the fist object disappeared. We were staring at the second one and when it got closer we could see its form. It looked like the letter “W”. It continued getting closer and then vanished. I think the closest it got was about a mile or so. We waited for a few minutes to see if they will “reappear”, but nothing happened.  I do not know exactly what we saw. They were either giant birds similar to the pterodactyls or some kind of crafts.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Ring of Blue Lights that moved similar to a jelly fish seen from 405 Freeway in South Orange County California.;2007-12-26 20:45:00;3 min;Ring of Blue Lights that moved similar to a jelly fish seen from 405 Freeway in South Orange County California. At around 8:45pm my sister, boyfriend and I were on the 405 freeway (South Bound) about to exit Lake Forest Drive, when my sister looked up and said “what is that!” I looked up and saw a ring of blue lights wobbling in the sky as it moved forward. It moved kind of like a jelly fish. When it moved out of my site because I was driving, I asked my boyfriend what it was doing. (He was in the back seat) and he said that it turned sideways then zoomed off quickly in a diagonal motion upward.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931

I knew I couldnt be the only one who thought this was strange and unusual.  It was im guessing motionless about 200 or 250 feet in the air.  As I approached it I noticed the three white lights and just thought it was a plane patrolling the freeways.  But as I got closer it became clear this was no plane nor was it a blimp due to its shape which was honestly dark and was only viewable due to some overcast skies reflecting the city lights behind it.  To me it looked like a soccer ball shape with 4 courners that seemed to flare  By this time im now very close to it and can see 3 more new lights that were red and staggerd between the first lights I seen from the front.  Passing it at well below the 65mph speed limit along with everyone else Im trying to make out what im looking at.  But I couldnt. It was just yards away on the oppisite side of the freeway so im lo! oking out my driver window stumped and somewhat suprised it was just sitting there.  I would argue til the end of time that it was not a blimp. Ive seen plenty of them to know this was much smaller and not elongated.and it was not a helicopter as it made no sound and was definately not equipped with rotors.  Oh and it wasnt a weather balloon or flares. Its something else and I just wanted to share what I saw in the sky last night.  Peace.  ((name deleted));33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Triangle, Diamond shaped star that moves in different directions, 3 spikes coming out one side with retracting line of lights.;2011-12-22 18:51:00;10 min (still there);Triangle, Diamond shaped star that moves in different directions, 3 spikes coming out one side with retracting line of lights. I have watched this thing move in all directions, stop, move again. I called my friends (2) people and they both are watching. The shape is a mix of traingle and diamond (it is very high) it looks like it has 3 spikes coming off a side. There seems to be some type of strand of light that retracts, it goes out and back in from what seems to be the back side. It has lights that flash every 20 seconds or so on all sides at different times. Whaite, Red & Blue. The whole thing is lit like a star. I cannot determine shape. At first I thought it was a satellite but satellites don't move like this. It has gone in all different directions. Slowly and VERY quickly, to complete stop. I feel crazy but I have NEVER seen something like this before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
