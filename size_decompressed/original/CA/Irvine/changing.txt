My wife and I were fishing at Irvine Lake near Orange Hills, CA. I looked up and saw on a lit up object traveling very quickly and completly silently on the neighboring hillside. It was travelling along the ridge towards the City of Orange. I exlaimed look at that! and my wife looked up and saw the object too. It was very clear. In 10 seconds it was out of view.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Sighting near Irvine Spectrum.;2007-10-30 17:15:00;45 seconds;Sighting near Irvine Spectrum. I work in south Irvine near the Spectrum and I was behind our building when I saw the object. Our building is at the end of a street named Goddard and right behind us are hills and some wilderness. I was out back talking on my cellphone and having a cigarette, just as I finished my phone call I happened to look up at a passing jet airliner. John Wayne Airport isn't too far away, so we see alot of air traffic. Well, as I was observing the jet, another object moved into view. What caught my eye was the sun reflecting off it's surface. At first I thought it was a weather balloon, as it was translucent in nature. It was a solid shape at first, like an aspirin. Then it lost it's shape and became unstable and undulated along. It did this for a moment, and then became a sphere, then going back to undulating. I watched it sharply and then it just disappeared. I'm not sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but I know what I saw. Also, I should mention a few other details such as it's size. While at first appearing small, the jet passed right underneath it. The jet was pretty high up there, so this thing must have been about 1/6 the size of the aircraft. Even though it was translucent, I did notice that whenever the sunlight reflected off it's surface, the material briefly became dark and metallic. Also, the object was coming from the direction of the hills behind us (west) and was heading east towards Santiago Mountain.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Bright shiny object-looked like a shiny fish in water-but changed shape quickly, then vanished;2013-03-31 13:10:00;8-10 seconds;Bright shiny object-looked like a shiny fish in water-but changed shape quickly, then vanished I just got out of church and was looking at the beautiful partly cloudy sky enjoying the breeze while talking to friends, when I noticed at first what looked like a reflecting light in the sky, which looked comparable to a silver fish in water.  It was shiny and shaped like a football. From the distance I was at, it looked about 1 mile away.  Within about 1-2 seconds it changed shape and started to shrink down to a small black object.  It disapeared in about 8 seconds total time. It seemed to be traveling west and straight.  It seemed to be moving fast as well.  Small planes do not change in shape from a bright reflection round shape to a tiny black object in 8 seconds and dissapear. It was moving fast, then vinished quickly.
