Large black diamond shaped object hovering and than disapeared to the north;1999-10-22 13:30:00;5 minutes;Large black diamond shaped object hovering and than disapeared to the north I was traveling north at the split of the I-5 & I-405 Freeways and I spotted a black diamond shaped object to the north that did not appear to be moving.  I pulled off to the side of the Freeway just before the  Route 133  and watched the object for about 5 minutes. During this time it did not move.  At the end of the 5 minutes it appeared to roll up on its side and turned toward the north.  The weather was clear with some high white clouds. It appeared to go north and disappeared into the clouds.  Iwould guess it was over the City of Orange or Anaheim in the area of Disneyland;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Diamond shaped lights rose rapidly up in the sky, then moved left to right in a fluid, fast movement;2006-11-11 22:00:00;15 seconds;Diamond shaped lights rose rapidly up in the sky, then moved left to right in a fluid, fast movement Exiting Irvine Center drive from the 405 freeway SOUTH, we were stopped at the light on the top of the overpass.  Glancing out the window to the southeast towards Laguna Hills We noticed 4 lights in a diamond arrangement rise from around 300' off the ground very rapidly to around 1000' off the ground in a matter of 2-3 seconds.  And in a continuous move, rock left to right very fluidly.  Our driver drove us out of view before we could observe more.  After discussing this with the other passengers, we all agreed that we could also observe searchlights in the sky around this object as it moved.   While not directly on the object, the searchlights were focused in the area around it.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
3 diamond shaped light configurations in the northwest corner of the sky towards Newport Beach, CA;2009-02-12 08:15:00;5 minutes;I was walking out of my Irvine CA apartment, which is on the third floor, on my way to meet a friend for dinner around 8:15 pm.  I immediately noticed 3 diamond shaped light configurations in the northwest corner of the sky towards Newport Beach, CA.  I of course stopped and just stared.  They were moving very fluidly, counter clockwise and then clock wise, back forth with no apparent set pattern- like kites would do.  The lights were a very bright light blue. They would go completely off and them come back on.   I couldn't make out exactly what type of craft they were on.  I watched for about a minute and then two of them disappeared and just one remained.  I saw it go behind a cloud and then reappear...so they had to be at least at cloud level.  They were quite high in the sky because I was seeing them way over trees and building tops.  I knew immediately that what I was seeing just by the shear movement of them was not an airplane, helicopter or military craft.  I was already running quite late so I got in the car and headed to meet my friend, while I was driving I tried to hang my head out the window to see the remaining object.  I wound up right under it when I got to the intersection and could make out a faint outline of some sort of a craft that looked grayish.  I was a little worried at that point, realizing I was right under it.  Then the traffic light turned and it was above my car so I could no longer see it.  I called two friends and tried to get them to go outside and se if they could see it as well, but didn't reach them in time.  Southern California is a big place with a huge population and I'm quite sure lots of other people had to see this as well.  The whole experience left me in awe and made me feel quite small….there’s a big “world” out there obviously and I doubt we here on earth are much more than a speck.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
