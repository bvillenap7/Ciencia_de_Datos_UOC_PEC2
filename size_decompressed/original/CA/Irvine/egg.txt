An object that disappeared in the clear blue sky;2004-02-11 10:15:00;2 minutes;An object that disappeared in the clear blue sky It looked like a balloon at first......because it was slow moving like a balloon.... It looked dark on one side (maybe black) and it shimmered silver in the sunlight. It just moved slowly across the sky....not further and further away like a balloon would do.... I then had a call on my cell phone, looked down for literally 2 seconds....when I looked back up it was gone. The visibility today in Irvine is 100%....clear blue sky. It disappeared...and now I am wondering if anyone else saw what I saw. I really feel that it was something other than a plane or balloon....these things just don't disappear like that.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
