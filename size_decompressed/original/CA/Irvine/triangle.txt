A triangularly shaped, noiseless aircraft almost crashed into our car.;2007-09-04 02:00:00;30 seconds;A triangularly shaped, noiseless aircraft almost crashed into our car. Last night, the moon was a bloody red and the sky was blue and black and purple. it appeared very ominous but still nothing to flip out. While I was driving, everyone in the car claimed to smell the sweet sweet aroma of vanilla cupcakes. We were out in the middle of nowhere, not knowing where we were apart from the fact that it was en route to irvine. They thought it was rather strange that the smell would be so prominent in the middle of the night, when we're surrounded by nothing but hills. Soon after, everyone in the car started exclaiming, 'omg, wth is that?! look at that!? from the corner of my eyes, all I could see were lights. It looked like a car was coming from a merging lane. When I actually looked over, i saw this triangular shaped aircraft. It had two lights, and was tilted at a 45 degree angle. It was flying at the same level as us, as if it were a car. And then, for some incomprehensible reason, this unidentified aircraft flew right in front of us, cutting us off. I was driving at 80 miles per hour, and was forced to brake. It might sound bizarre and a little egotistical, but it really, really, really, seemed like it was out to get us. It pretty much intercepted us. changed directions right when it came in front of us. And when it was ahead of us, it took off, and decided to head towards the sky. It made no noise. You know how airplanes and things like that make an insane amount of noise even if you're about a mile way? well, it was close as hell to us and we heard nothing from it.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Irvine CA, 8:05 PM Dec. 24 2011. V Shaped light formation 4 lights on each side which pulsated extreamly bright white.;2011-12-24 20:05:00;3-5 min;Irvine CA, 8:05 PM Dec. 24 2011. V Shaped light formation 4 lights on each side which pulsated extreamly bright white. Eight very bright lights in a triangle (4 light in each side creating a V).  LIghts were VERY bright white and they pulsated in a methodical way like a heart beat.  Moving slowly and very low in the sky. Arched towards the ocean and continued to gain speed at a gradual pace and disappeared.  Unusually clear for Orange County.  And when I stopped my and got out to look at the lights all the neighborhood dogs were barking.  Barking stopped about 4 min after the UFO was out of sight.

Near 10:30pm, silent, triangular UFO, deep orange lights, white beam, flies slow about 10,000 ft disappeared by vertical ascent.;2012-07-03 22:30:00;2 minutes;Near 10:30pm, silent, triangular UFO, deep orange lights, white beam, flies slow about 10,000 ft disappeared by vertical ascent. (July 3, 2012 in Irvine, CA)  My husband and I were walking the dogs around 10:30pm, when I looked up at the stars, and noticed a triangular object high in the sky. It was gliding slowly, in a straight line, making no sound â€“ flying in from the coast.  The bottom of the object had three large deep orange lights, spaced close together and non-blinking.  In the center of these lights was a wide beam of bright blue-white light (shaped like an inverted ice-cream cone), pointing toward ground.  After the radiant object turned off the cone-shaped beam, it continued to fly in the same straight line.  Then it stopped and hovered overhead a few seconds before ascending vertically into space.  My husband is a private pilot and estimates the object flew near 10,000 ft.  He is confident it was not a helicopter with a searchlight.

Large Triangular translucent craft flew over the house while star gazing the width of 2 full moons.  I was 100% silent with no lights.;2014-01-25 20:45:00;35-40 seconds;Large Triangular translucent craft flew over the house while star gazing the width of 2 full moons.  I was 100% silent with no lights. I saw a large translucent/shadowy wide triangular craft.  I was star gazing and it crossed my POV about 5 minutes in doing a fly by lasting about 35-40 seconds.  It made NO sounds, and had NO lights.  It moved in a perfect straight line.  It was the width of 2 moons so it must have been a very giant low flying craft. I have it on Google Maps checked where I was standing at: 33*42' 17.43N 117*47' 1.18W  -Craft was flying mostly East to West towards the ocean/Newport Beach.  Through my research I found about 2 weeks earlier a popular Newport Beach triangular formation o flights the same dimension as the craft I saw is going viral on Youtube, but filmed in the day time.  My theory is it must have some cloaking device considering it matched the color of the sky perfect.  It look just like a black outline and flew in such a perfect straight line into the horizon, almost like someone dragging an icon across a monitor perfectly straight.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
Hovering craft with red and green blinking lights.  Hovers for a minute and then moved to a new spot.;2015-07-25 22:30:00;5 minutes;Hovering craft with red and green blinking lights.  Hovers for a minute and then moved to a new spot. I was walking my dog and we were passing through two buildings in my Condo Complex.  I heard a buzzing sound like a drone but didn't see anything.   After I came to the side walk I looked up and I saw 3-4 red blinking lights.  The aircraft was hovering high in the air, but the lights were extremely bright.   Within a few seconds of noticing the 3/4 bright red lights, a green light blinked.   The craft moved in a line and then stopped again.  Hovered for about 30-45 seconds and then moved again in a horizontal line.   At this point, I noticed another green light blinking.   I was quite mesmerized by the sight of this and it was definitely not a helicopter.   I was curious if anyone else saw something on this quiet night.;33.6790729013254;-117.790111192931
