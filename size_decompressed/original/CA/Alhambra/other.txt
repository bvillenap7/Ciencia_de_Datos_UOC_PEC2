This craft was NOT unidentified.  It was in fact a P-2 Orion used primarily as an electronic intelligence gathering craft.;2002-05-13 13:45:00;2 min.;This craft was NOT unidentified.  It was in fact a P-2 Orion used primarily as an electronic intelligence gathering craft. What I found unusual about this sighting was that I observed this craft over a heavily populated city at an altitude of no more than 2,000 feet and was apparently suffering from some type of powerplant malfunction, for I observed white smoke eminatting from the port outboard engine. What I found most troubling was that when I contacted Los Angeles International Airport and a local Air Force information office, I was told in no uncertain terms thatI DID NOT observe the mentioned aircraft. After being informed that no military aircraft were on any flight plan within this city's area, I did not even waste my breath relaying what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness may allude to a P-3 Orion aircraft.  A P-2 is a Neptune.  PD));34.0835968085109;-118.13610212766
