We had seen one fairly large looking star turning red and white . We had thought it was a helicopter but it was moving up and down side and side very fast . We think looked around and seen there was 10-15 other moving like stars moving fast . Some pausing and some were moving up and down . The others were much farther away though then the one that was turning red.;34.0835968085109;-118.13610212766
