UFO Sighting near Los Angeles;2002-10-04 19:10:00;2minutes;UFO Sighting near Los Angeles At 7:10pm I was driving on the I10 going east into Alhambra.  High above CA State University Los Angeles I saw what appeared to be UFO.  What I saw matches the photo of the UFO photographed in Las Cruces, NM.  It looked like a dome top and it was circular, it had lights around it and looked like it had an upside down triangle shaped bottom.  It was at a slight angle as it hovered so I was able to see it clearly.  I believe others on the freeway could see it as there was a bit of a jam and cars were slowing down, I believe, to look at it.  The evening was a bit hazy but I could see that there was something hovering over the university.  It was fairly high up and about the size of a small house, definitely bigger than a car.  I lost sight of it as I was trying to drive on the freeway and look for it.  It appeared that there was light emanating from the craft, I couldn't tell if the light was coming from the ground or from the craft itself.  If anyone could help and give me some info via email I would greatly appreciate it.;34.0835968085109;-118.13610212766
