People of Earth unite and love each other;1977-09-15 13:44:00;10-20 min;My late husband (27) (printer), my son (8 yrs old), and I (25) (worked in a bank), went to a fast food place to get a late lunch, and on our way out of the restaurant saw a flying saucer hovering above the telephone lines.  It was metallic, about 500 ft wide and 50 ft. in height (at it's 1/2 sphere shaped top). And had white lights circling at it's widest part. As we watched the lights rotate we recieved a message from the ship. People of Earth unite and love each other  Then I looked at my son and he at me and we repeated the message verbatum.  After that, we looked back towards the ship and it was gone.  We were not scared by this experiencce, we just went home to eat. That night as everyoone slept, I looked up at the sky and saw hundreds of lights with strange movements, and some that traveled in threes.  It was reported in the local newspaper that 10,000 sightings were reported that night.   I have made one report this is my second.  I just didn't know who to tell about it.
