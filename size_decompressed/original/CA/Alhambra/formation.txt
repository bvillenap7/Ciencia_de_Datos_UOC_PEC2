Set of 3 lights flying close together accompanied by 2 sing lights almost flying in unison.;2020-03-29 08:45:00;30 seconds;Was walking my dog in alhambra on 3/29/20. looked up around where orions belt is located and to the left flying down towards the middle of the belt were a set of 3 lights flying close together accompanied by 2 sing lights almost flying in unison. either it was one really large craft or a group of 2 small ufos flying along with bigger ones. drifted off and disappeared as it went into orions belt. not sure what it was or if it was satelites but ive never seen what ive seen before. Im officially now looking up more for UFOS.;34.0835968085109;-118.13610212766
