3 Black ovals in the sky and a floating movie camera;2003-10-10 12:00:00;5 min;3 Black ovals in the sky and a floating movie camera This is NOT a UFO report. I just thought it was really strange all the same. I saw three black ovals in the sky. Hanging from them was one movie camera. One of those big professional reporter sized cameras. The camera was looking around all by it self. No one was in sight. It was no higher in the sky than a two story building. After about two minutes it slowly took off east into the sky and then turned south. I couldn't see any supporting cables. Thats what made it really weird! And the black ovals were REALLY BLACK! The sharpest, clearest, brightest BLACK you have ever seen! The street it was hovering over was Vally Blvd and Garfield in Alhambra CA 91801.  Of course there are no such things as UFO's. I think it was just some hollywood guys checking out the city for sites to film. The funny thing is. I could NOT hear any helicopter noises comeing from the ovals. Nothing, nada. Weird huh?
