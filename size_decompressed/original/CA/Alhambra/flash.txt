Also, all the street lights went out, I'm guessing the photocells in the street lights sense it was daytime and it turn off..  after a 1-2 minutes the street lights came on again. my two neighbors also saw the same thing.

When we looked out and up, there was a bright streak traveling North to South and at a VERY high rate of speed. I’ve seen meteors and comets, this was neither one. I’ve never seen anything like this before, the streak it left behind was bright glowing white with some yellow that faded, the best way for me to suscribe it would be as if an electrical wire were to be over loaded and glowed.  I was hoping my dash cam caught what we saw but when I tried to review the footage  my dash cam froze about 1/4 mile from where we saw it.;34.0835968085109;-118.13610212766
