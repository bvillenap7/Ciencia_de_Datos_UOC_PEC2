Bright orange ball from NE to SW,  transforming itself to a boomerang shape;2017-10-15 01:15:00;3 minutes;Bright orange ball from NE to SW,  transforming itself to a boomerang shape On October 15, 2017, Sunday morning, between the hours of 1AM to 1:30AM, my wife's son (32 years of age), and I were outside the patio conversing about astronomy.  I was showing him how to locate North star and the Big Dipper, with my green laser.  It was getting cold that morning, he then went inside the house to put something warm.  While he was inside the house, I panned to the Northeast sky and saw a bright orange flame-like ball from afar, about one mile away.  As I was in awe, it approached towards my house, over the patio at zenith, I then grabbed my 9 x 63 binoculars, but could not focus on the object.  The flame-like ball transformed into a boomerang shape, and it appeared to have a cloudy, blurry, fuzzy, hazy surrounding the fire-ball blades of the boomerang shape.  It then came down to a lower altitude. I then shouted out to my wife's son to come outside and said, hurry-up!, that he needed to see this.  I then passed him my 9 x 63 binoculars and told him to try and focus on it. He said he could not focus on it.  As it was getting further away from my house, I decided to point my green laser at it, and it made contact to a solid green dot on the object.  The object then disappeared about less than half mile out. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness, and highly reliable.  PD));34.0835968085109;-118.13610212766
