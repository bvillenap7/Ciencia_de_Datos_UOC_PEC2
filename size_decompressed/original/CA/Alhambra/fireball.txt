Bright flash of light and streak of light over Alhambra, CA;2006-03-25 03:50:00;4-5 seconds;Bright flash of light and streak of light over Alhambra, CA Standing outside my apartment about to go in when I saw a bright flash of light that seemed to come from almost directly above me, in a sort of northerly direction.  As I turned to look I saw a streak of light falling from the direction of the flash (or seemed to be falling), downwards angle, towards the east.  The streak of light was shaped almost like a teardrop, and I'm pretty sure I saw it change color from a pure white to a bright orange before either disappearing or falling out of my point of view.  There was no sound, and the entire event lasted less than 5 seconds.  To be honest, I don't think it was a UFO, but I'm kinda hoping it IS one, because to my uneducated eyes, it looked like a missile or a plane exploding, either one of which would be bad....;34.0835968085109;-118.13610212766
