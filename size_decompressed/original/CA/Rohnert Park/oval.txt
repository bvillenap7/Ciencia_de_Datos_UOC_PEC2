Shiny chrome object flying across sky with military plane following.;2015-05-25 14:20:00;3 minutes;Shiny chrome object flying across sky with military plane following. I was in my backyard getting sun and heard a plane.  I looked up and saw a black plane flying in one direction and then I noticed a shiny chrome oval shaped object flying across the sky in the opposite direction.   The sky was clear of any clouds where the object was flying. I stared and watched the chrome oval flying (it was flying faster than the plane).  Then I saw the black plane (military?) had turned around to head in the direction of the chrome object, as if it was going to see what it was. when I looked back toward the area in the sky where the chrome oval was, it was gone.  I watched the black plane continue flying in that direction until I could no longer see passed the houses.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
