One then vanished, two remained, became very active, then the largest white shooting star  tail/streak wen directly between the two.  To me, it seemed as if the 3rd object took off  into space.  The white began and ended in a direction from Earth towards space.  It was very 3-Dimensional and I believe the object exited our atmosphere from a stationary position to a 1 second blast towards space. The sky remained very lively while numerous larger objects/crafts floating like hot air balloons, changing colors from blue-green-red-gold.  10-30 degress above horizon remained active with 'excited'small colored objects, defitely moving in all directionns, above were many slower but larger and clearer object, color displays and changes were very mech/electrical, not slow changes as if reflected light from Hale-Bopp,which was always present in the North Eastern sky.   Many totally vertical risings and decents of objects of different size and color.  Helicopter?  Hawk planes?   Sky quickly became less active, darker, as many objects exited view.  Sky black with few stars @4:00am.   Sunrise brought about much actvity on black sillouteted hills.  Huge dark craft rose vertically to top of hills and remainded. moonrise 600am;38.34550625;-122.69204375
While driving, I noticed a round torquoise colored sphere falling from the sky to the North East of Rohnert Park.  The object dissapear;1999-01-11 18:00:00;5 seconds;While driving, I noticed a round torquoise colored sphere falling from the sky to the North East of Rohnert Park.  The object dissapeared just prior to reaching the ground.  At first I thought it was a comet, but there was not a trail. In addition to myself, my two children saw the object. At Appx. 1800 hrs, while driving, I noticed a round torquoise colored sphere falling from the sky to the North East of Rohnert Park.  The object fell almost straight from the sky and dissapeared just prior to reaching the ground.  At first I thought it was a comet, but there was not a tail. The whole incident lasted only a few seconds. In addition to myself, my two sons witnessed the sighting. There was also an aircraft of some type, to the North, that should of had an eyeful of the object. I am a 33 year old male. My present position is a licensed wastewater treatment plant operator.  I have been employed in the water/wastewater treatment field since 1985.  I was a member of the USAF active duty from 1985-1992. My sons ages are 8 and 5.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
Reddish spheres spotted in Northern Califonia.;2009-02-01 19:30:00;5 minutes;Reddish spheres spotted in Northern Califonia. Sunday, February 1, 2009 Sonoma County, California 38 degrees, 20’, 47” N 122 degrees, 41’, 54” W   At approximately 7:30 pm PST, I witnessed a strange light in the western sky approximately 35 degrees up from the western horizon west southwest from my position.  At first I thought it to be the planet Venus (as I am accustomed to seeing this planet in the sky at around this time of night during this season) but it was very reddish in appearance.  I then spotted Venus off to the right and lower in the sky than the object in question. I then went into the house to get my binoculars to have a closer look. After retrieving my binoculars, I looked again and the object began to emit what appeared to be flare-like objects which were the same color as the object and they drifted downward, appearing to be affected by gravity but had some velocity to them as well. I could not resolve the object any better with my binoculars than I could with the naked eye. I could not see any detail besides the color which was an orange-red. Finally the object began to wane and then it would come back brighter then wane again. Finally it disappeared altogether. During the episode, the object did not appear to move across the sky, but remained stationary. A neighbor saw it as did my daughter-in-law. The neighbor said he saw it change position in the sky but did not think it to be an aircraft as it moved very slowly. When I first saw it, I thought it was Venus. Then I thought it might be a distant star undergoing some sort of change but when the flare-like objects started to emit from it I was reminded of a combat aircraft dropping flares to avoid heat-seeking missiles. However, there were only about six flare-like objects released from the main body of the object, and they were not brighter but rather they were the same color and brightness as the main object. There were no flashing lights or different color lights. The only change in appearance that I witnessed was the eventual fading of the object and the reappearance of the object only to fade again and finally disappear for good.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
black, shiny spheres over california;2010-12-10 14:00:00;a minute or so;black, shiny spheres over california I was driving home from my grandmother's house with my mother when I saw a faraway black sphere moving through the sky. It was the second time, actually, I had seen something of this nature. The first time I was at a friend's house, and her sisters and I were laying on the trampoline when we saw it. both of these objects were the same. They were clearly very far away, smaller than an airplane, black, and spherical. Occasionally the sun would hit it and there would be a bright, silver reflection. They moved slowly like airplanes do, but because of the apparent altitude, it was probably moving pretty swiftly.The speed was very regular, I never saw it speed up or slow down, just move in a straight, slow line accross the sky. I don't know what this could have been, but I'm sure it wasn't a bird or a plane.  Neither fly that high! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.34550625;-122.69204375

Huge red stationary, pulsing sphere in the southeast sky just after midnight on New Years Day 2014;2014-01-01 00:05:00;3 minutes;Huge red stationary, pulsing sphere in the southeast sky just after midnight on New Years Day 2014 On January 1st, 2014, at 12:05am, in Rohnert Park, Ca., just after the new year rang in, my girlfriend and I went out to the backyard to listen to people shoot off their guns and fireworks.   We were on the deck looking south when we both noticed a red orb in the sky, stationary, just above the tree line towards the southeast.  It had a presence that seemed unusual. My g/f said at the time it must be a NYE blimp.  We did not get a picture.   I thought it might just be a blimp too, but it wasn't moving. It was stationary, but kind of hovering like a blimp would, and gently pulsing.  It was much bigger than any star in the sky. We would estimate the size to be about 3x that of Jupiter- easily.   We went back in after a couple minutes because it was cold.  Two weeks later when I read an article saying that multiple other witnesses had seen the same red/orange orb(s), I knew that what we'd seen was not a blimp, because throughout the southeast part of the stat! e (it was southeast in the sky) people had seen what I'd seen.   We are both in our mid-30's, we enjoy star-gazing and we were not under the influence of drugs at the time.  This is not my first sighting.   I have now had 4 legitimate UFO experiences/sightings, with the latest ones being this week, one on the 4th of July, and then again the next night.  My first sighting was in January 2012 of a huge black triangle which I will now document as well.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
