Super fast object with swirly contrail;2015-11-22 16:15:00;<5 seconds;Super fast object with swirly contrail At approximately 16:15, heading west, northwest a highly reflective seed-, or teardrop-, shaped object, moving across the sky at a very high rate of speed.  Its contrail is what first caught my attention, best described as a curlycue swirl shape.  Object moved across the visible horizon in only seconds, incredibly quick.  This is roughly the same heading that the recent test rocket seen on the Pacific coast took, I managed to photograph that sighting.   This time the object had the sun behind it and its contrail, so none of the photos came out.   I submitted a report and photo from the previous rocket launch sight in a few weeks back, same city.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
