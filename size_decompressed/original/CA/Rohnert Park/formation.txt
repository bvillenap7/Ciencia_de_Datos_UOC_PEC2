Cluster of four bright lights in clear blue sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly an advertising light??  PD));2007-08-07 18:44:00;10 minutes;Cluster of four bright lights in clear blue sky. I was out on my backyard porch while on the phone.  I looked up as I noticed a helicopter overhead.  That’s when I spotted the bright lights that looked like stars up in the clear blue sky.   One was separated from the other three.  The three were clustered together and traveling in a pattern of swirling in and out of each other.   At one point they looked like a snake in the way they moved.  They were in the east and up pretty high.  They moved slowly across the sky.   I asked my friend on the phone if she could see them from her location, but she could not.  She advised me to video tape them, so I did.  The time recorded was 18:44 hours.  I didn’t think anything much of it until I showed the tape to my friend and than we found this website.  They were pretty fascinating. I had to leave the house, so I only watched them for about 10 minutes.   I am a 41 year old female U.S. Air Force veteran who never saw anything like this while on active duty!

White boomerang shaped objects swarming and floating then immediately disappeared together.;2018-07-10 11:30:00;3-4 minutes;White boomerang shaped objects swarming and floating then immediately disappeared together. Looked West into sky at 11:30 a.m. today and noticed what I thought was a flock of white birds.  Their movement wasn't bird-like and they didn't form into any sort of distinct patterns together.  The way they moved seemed as if in all directions including backwards and sideways and they sort of swarmed around like kites but independent of anything holding them.  They were all white and shaped like boomerangs and kept moving in a swarm and all of a sudden simply disappeared.  My friend and I both watched them trying to figure out what they could be.  No idea.  As for background, I have no scientific training and we were simply standing out by my car.  I wish I had thought to take a photo.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
