Triangle object dropping fireballs;2009-06-29 23:10:00;2 minutes;Triangle object dropping fireballs I was facing west looking up at the moon when I caught a bright flash of white light out of the corner of my eye. I turned north to face it, it was high up but it's shape was clearly visable as it was heading south-southeast it moved slowly and pitched from side to side. I knew at this point that it was not an aircraft. There was no noise coming from the sky, it was shaped like a triangle with a slowly dimming red/white light emanating from the center. The light would at times, look like a dimming campfire. As it moved slowly across the sky, I called my mother outside and as soon as I looked back up we saw that this craft was being followed by an aircraft (military) which we could now hear. It seemed to be following this object from underneath because the object looked so high up. Then the object stopped and hovered for a second and it dropped a reddish white fireball toward the ground, after it fell the craft picked up speed, I guess it noticed it was being followed at this point. It moved faster toward the south, then dropped another fireball. We watched this fireball drop somewhere in the distance, it seemed to burn out before it hit the ground. After this last drop it disappeared rather quickly going eastward, maybe toward sonoma/napa area?. Then the aircraft/jet took off southeast.
