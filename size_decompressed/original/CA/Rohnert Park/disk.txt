Reddish brown disc appeared due east, sighted as I pulled out into the street from my driveway. I thought it could be the moon but it was too small. Also, I thought it might be some space junk entering the atmosphere, burning up as it moved west to east and descended. I turned my attention driving. By the time I reached the end of the long block I looked up. There was no sign of the object then.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
