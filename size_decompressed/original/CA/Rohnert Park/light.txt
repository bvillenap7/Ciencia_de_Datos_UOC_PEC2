Brite white light with a downward tail;2000-01-28 19:15:00;apx 15 sec;Brite white light with a downward tail My wife and two daugthers were leaving for the store, and I walked out with them. My dauther ((deleted)) asked if when she came back from the store, she & I could setup the telescope and look at the stars. I said it would be ok and then we looked up at the sky toward CASSIEOPIA when we saw a bright light that was about the same size and briteness as Venus is when it is in the night sky, just one hand to the right of Cassieopia and about two fingers lower. It made a little ziz zag side to side and appeared to have a tail/beam appx. a finger width shining down and comming to a point at the bottom. We all saw it for about 15 sec, then it just got real fuzzy looking and just blinked out.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
A light dancing and shooting in the sky , lots of diferent  fast movements, changing in diameter.;2003-12-26 20:00:00;1 hour;A light dancing and shooting in the sky , lots of diferent  fast movements, changing in diameter. I saw a light, looked like a star, It was moving in a strange way. At first skittering like a bug.  So I was curious, I watched for a few minutes and it was dancing all over tthe sky.  I went to get my camera and tried to take a picture with out much luck.  Then I got my video camera and started to shoot it.  It was a round circular light that was growing larger and smaller in diameter, it seemed to have some red and blue smaller lights spinning, althought this can't be seen as good on the video.  It was also exploding like a firework on the 4th of July many times.  This can be seen on the vidio.  I continued to tape the light it was shooting across the sky faster the a shooting star at times.  I had my zoom on it and it shot right out of the screen and back through it afew times really fast.  It exploded out of sight.  I went to get a new tape so I could try to get some more. It came back in sight. I shot some more without the zoom so I could get all of the movements.  I got some more but not as intense as the beginning. After awhile longer it vanished.  I was totally amazed I had called a friend to tell her.  It was really something!

8 floating lights.;2014-11-04 20:00:00;3 minutes;8 floating lights. From outside of a school office, five other people of varying ages and I saw a series of floating lights in the sky relatively close to each other which appeared to be moving slightly around fixed spots in the sky a few hundred feet in the air.  After about a minute, these lights began moving slowly as if blown by the wind, but in different directions.  Some of the lights raised into the sky while the lowest light moved horizontally until one by one, they went out as if burning out like a candle.  All of the lights were of a uniform color and luminosity.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
