Around 4pm, I was observing and recording all of the unnatural and odd cloud formations in the sky.  I saw a white sphere/orb high in the northeast sky that I at first thought might be a balloon.  It was not rising and disappearing like a balloon would.  It was stationary, yet slowly coasting west and northwest. I have 4 others who witnessed this as well.  For the next few hours, I watched this white ball in the sky drift west towards the sun that was beginning to set in the sky. It was intelligently controlled whatever it was.  It would stop and remain stationary for a while, then it would start to coast west again.  I have video footage of this orb and will send it.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
