flare-type unidentified light over Rohnert Park, CA;2003-11-20 17:45:00;1 second;flare-type unidentified light over Rohnert Park, CA I was driving south on Highway 101 at about 5:45pm. There were many cars on the highway, so it is possible that many other people witnessed this as well. I looked to the left as a bright light caught my eye. It looked at first like a shooting star, but then it slowed down and moved erratically before disappearing. I thought maybe it had been a signal flare shot off, but it was bright white and did not appear to have a streak following the path of the light, the way a burning flare does. Plus it's descent was not in an arc, but moved around in a squiggly pattern before disappearing. I probably would not report this, except that I got a call from someone else in the area who saw strange lights in the sky last night in nearby Petaluma, CA.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
Bright yellow fireball made right angle turn and disappeared.;2010-07-03 22:25:00;About 15 seconds;Bright yellow fireball made right angle turn and disappeared. It was a beautiful clear night as I walked along the residential sidewalk heading north about 10:25 pm when I saw a bright yellow fireball heading south, toward me out of the north, moving at approximately the same apparent speed as an airliner, but as it drew nearer I could tell it wasn’t an airplane, as it had the appearance of a bright yellow flame, not trailing anything like a comet, and not appearing to go as fast as a shooting star, but as it approached and got nearer and brighter, I could distinctly tell it was not any sort of craft, airplane, or Chinese Lantern, (which I have seen frequently over Rohnert Park, this being much brighter, faster, and obviously directed somehow) but as it drew close, almost above me, seeming to be maybe not much more than 1,000 to 1,500’ up. Just as I thought I'd get a really good look at it, as I knew it wasn't an airplane, as it was just a bright golden yellow flaming light, as it drew almost directly above me it made ! an abrupt right angle turn towards the east and quickly disappeared. It did not steak off to the horizon, but faded rapidly and disappeared. There was no sound or other evidence that I noticed.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
Flickering gold light, inaudible, slowly moving  along a low cloud ceiling;2010-07-23 00:30:00;60 seconds;Flickering gold light, inaudible, slowly moving  along a low cloud ceiling Single flickering gold/orange light (similar to a flame), slowly moving in easterly direction just under cloud/fog ceiling at 12:30am.   The object meandered back and forth without any sound for several minutes and disappeared.  There were two observers with design backgrounds;38.34550625;-122.69204375
One small orange orb or ball of fire that changed direction and drifted across the horizon;2011-11-06 18:35:00;5 minutes;One small orange orb or ball of fire that changed direction and drifted across the horizon I began driving Eastbound on Allan Avenue after leaving my fiance's home when I noticed a bright orange orb descending vertically and sort of flickering like a flame between the moon and what I believe was Jupiter in the Eastern sky.  There was some sparse cloud cover and I pulled over after I realized that the object did not display any typical required aircraft lighting.  The area is in the path of several major and minor airports in the Norther Bay Area so there is a lot of air traffic and the object was moving too slowly to be a falling. I began to shoot digital photographs. A neighbor and two others were getting into a car in the adjacent driveway and they asked me what the object was.  I told the neighbor that I did not know and that is why I was trying to take photos, to which he replied Beam me up, Scotty indicating that he did not recognize what the object could be either.  It then changed direction and brightness and began to drift Southward over the University area, under the cloud cover, an estimated 200' to 500' above the ground and about a mile to my East. I continued to take digital photos and tried to adjust settings on the camera to get a better image until it drifted too far away for the optics to capture an image.  At least five minutes from the initial sighting to the object drifting over the Southern horizon.;38.34550625;-122.69204375
