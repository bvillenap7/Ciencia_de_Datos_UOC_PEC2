Second, I'm doing this because I believe what I experienced was real. My girlfriend and I stayed at a BnB in the Yosemite area in CA this weekend.  On the first night at exactly 3am, I woke up, feeling like I was being watched.  Approximately 20 minutes later, the cabin started to vibrate.  I'm a combat veteran and I've never been that terrified ever. The following night, again 3am, same thing.  20 minutes a vibration.  No sounds, no lights. But the same terrified feeling. I don't get scared easily and I believe what I can see.  This experience was a horrible feeling.  My girlfriend doesn't remember me waking her up, she doesn't remember the vibration, nothing... I'd also like to add that I did not visually see anything.  Something was watching us. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
