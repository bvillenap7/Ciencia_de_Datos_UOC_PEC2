object in the sky that could not be a start or other aircraft known to current populations;2009-08-30 23:00:00;over two hours;object in the sky that could not be a start or other aircraft known to current populations The light is on the east north east horizon at about 2 o'clock. The light seems to change color and hovers and then makes eraatic moves no known earthly craft can make. It makes vertical, circles and drops that in the given time frame and distance to the object it would not be possible even for a scramjet aircraft. The g force would cause a blackout. I did get a still shot with a 10 megapixel camera. It did not show up well on the video when I tried to sue the camera.;34.2561;-117.1488
