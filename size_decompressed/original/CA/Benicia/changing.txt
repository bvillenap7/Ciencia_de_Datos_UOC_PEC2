Myself and my sisters fiance were looking for falling stars from a meteor showers..it was aprox. 2 thirty in the morning...we were watching towards the east when something made me look to the north west..this craft came right over the Benicia Police station and right above my sisters house..aprox 75' above her home...it was sort of triangular..yet it was changing shape..without a sound...as it flew silently over our heads...and slowly..we watched as the underneath of this  craft was moving ....sort of like folding a fan into itself.....like making a disk into a triangle.  we could see what resembled I beams that had varing circles in them...it had a soft red glow around the outer rim of the craft...we tried to report it then..but got laughed at and told we were nuts...but we both still remember as if we just saw it..that was 7 years ago....it was quite awesome.
