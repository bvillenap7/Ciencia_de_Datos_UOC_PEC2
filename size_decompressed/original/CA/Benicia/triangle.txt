Midday sighting of UFO with apparent intercept attempt;2008-02-25 11:50:00;2 minutes;Midday sighting of UFO with apparent intercept attempt Craft was a double triangle connected by rectangular structure.  Color was silver-white.  I was looking through binoculars at soaring hawks when the object came into my field of view.  Visible as a white dot without binoculars.  Appeared in the SSW at an elevation of 30-40 degrees with no contrail or sound. Seemed to roll on its side and dive vertically at a high rate of speed.  As it did so, smaller objects approached the area vacated by the object.  These smaller objects crossed paths in a head-on path at an extremely high rate of speed.  The objects had a thin spiraling contrails that disappeared rapidly.  There were approximately eight of these objects(four facing four). My binoculars are E. Leitz 7x50. I am a retired Air Force Bombardier/Navigator with over 5000 hours flying time in B-52 and FB-111 aircraft.  I have never seen anything like this in all of my flying career.  I now work from my home.  I had stepped out on my deck to watch Re-tailed hawks when the incedent occured.;38.0663;-122.1655
