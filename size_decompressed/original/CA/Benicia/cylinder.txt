3 sets of 5 red glowing cylinders flew over the bay near Benicia, CA.;2013-03-09 22:00:00;45 minutes;3 sets of 5 red glowing cylinders flew over the bay near Benicia Ca We were pulling onto our street when I spotted a red cylinder shaped object moving slowly from the west to the east, we stopped the vehicle and jumped out and began videoing the object with our cell phone.  The object was followed by four more objects that were exactly the same.  The objects at the time we noticed them were approximately 300 feet above the water and they slowly rose at an approximate 45 degree angle into the sky until they were out of site.   Within a few minutes 5 more objects followed the same path and then another 5 appeared and followed the same path. We videoed the entire episode until the last of the objects were out of site.;38.0663;-122.1655
