Orange glowing sphere.;2017-07-31 21:00:00;40 seconds;Orange glowing sphere. Cresting 780 outside Benicia in moving car,  All 3 of us in the car saw a house sized sphere with an orange glowing core floating above the area.  It was rising slowly in my (driver's) view.  The other passengers kept site of the object as I took our exit and said it rose straight up, picking up speed, and went so high so fast that it disappeared.;38.0663;-122.1655
