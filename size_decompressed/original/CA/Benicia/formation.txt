UFO's seen over Benicia, California as five objects converge and separate.  3 witnesses.;2004-06-01 14:50:00;5 minutes;UFO's seen over Benicia, California as five objects converge and separate.  3 witnesses. 3 objects and 2 objects seem to meet in the sky - then two left in formation towards the east and three made new formation and left towards the west.  I flagged down the US letter carrier and pointed them out - he saw the 3 objects plainly as we watched them together.  Then we saw two Mormon missionaries and I pointed the objects out to them.  One of the boys saw the three objects, the other one did not.  The objects appeared to be round and reflected the sunlight occasionally.  They were mostly white and there were no colors or sound.  When I first saw them, I also saw a biplane heading east to west in their vecinity, but the objects were higher in the sky.   The objects were moving slower than the plane. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and with the U. S. postal employee, and we found them both to seem quite serious-minded and credible.  We do not know what it was they observed.

This is right in an area with heavy comercial air traffic.   The lights disappeared 1 by 1.  Right after the last one disappeared 2 jet fighters started circling the area.  Time was around 21:00 on March 5, 2015.;38.0663;-122.1655
