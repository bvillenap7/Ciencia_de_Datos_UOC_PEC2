Very Bright Orange Light Moving Slowly;2007-05-19 21:50:00;3-4 mins;At 2150 hrs, I walked outside of my house and looked to the south towards Ontario International Airport and witnessed a very bright orange light moving slowly to the North East. This caught my eye because it looked exactly like the light I witnessed and reported last month in the same area but much slower.  I called to my wife to come outside so she could witness it. It was moving very slow with several large passenger jets passing over it.  I asked my wife to retrieve my binoculars from the house, as she was inside it stopped and hovered without moving.  As looked through the binoculars, I witnessed a slight aura around the object, neither blinking strobes nor lights. It was a very bright orange, unknown structure, and had no apparent noise coming from it.  We stood and observed it for about 3-4 minutes. The orange light blinked off and on several times and then it disappeared from its stationary position.  My wife was freaked out by the whole experience.  I know many people witnessed this for the weather was very clear and the light was very bright. I am curious if Ontario International Airport was aware of this?;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061

Very Bright circle aircraft with 4 bright lights like lightbulbs.;2020-04-26 20:18:00;90 Seconds;Very Bright circle aircraft with 4 bright lights like lightbulbs April 26th, 2020 @ 20:18 (8:18 PM) I was outside relaxing with my older and younger sisters and my old dog. It was outside right after the sun went down. It was 91 degrees that day so it was nice out. I then saw a bright light on the horizon towards the west where the sun went down. I thought it was Venus because Venus is the evening star. I then saw it moving slowly so I thought it was a plane, helicopter, or a drone. The light stopped in place and then it moved rapidly. It then stopped in place. This is when my sisters got a little concerned about it. I ran to get my binoculars. I came back and I looked through them.  This is what the UFO looked like. It was a circle with four beams of light on the bottom. They looked on lamps.  I had an amazing pair of binoculars that were very expensive so I cold see every detail.  The aircraft was extremely bright.  My sister tried to take a video and we have footage of it.  The video is not the best because it is an iPhone, but at least we have the event on camera. The aircraft then dropped down towards the horizon until we could not see it anymore;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
