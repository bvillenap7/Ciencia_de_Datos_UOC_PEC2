Rancho Cucamonga Daytime Diamond Shaped Object;2008-09-13 17:45:00;1 minute;Rancho Cucamonga Daytime Diamond Shaped Object An hour before sunset on Saturday. My wife was leaving our apartment to run an errand for her mother. We live in a second floor apartment. I ventured outside onto the porch area(which faces east) to bid her farewell. Thats when I noticed a helicopter flying low in the sky. Then I noticed that helicopter was following something moving directly east. This something was a translucent diamond shaped object and its color matched the haze of the sky. It had no lights and wasn't outpacing the helicopter by much. If it was silent I wouldn't have noticed because of the helicopter's sound. It was in my field of view for about 15 seconds. I exclaimed, What the heck is that. Simultaneously, my wife couldn't get our car started and asked me to look into it. I waited a while because I was still in awe of what I had seen and was describing it to her and my daughter. Then ten minutes later I started the car with no problem. She stated that she saw the same object at the same time I did.;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
