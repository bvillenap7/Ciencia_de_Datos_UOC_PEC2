weird tear drop object that was moving extremely fast;2009-08-22 21:50:00;10 seconds;weird tear drop object that was moving extremely fast we were driving down haven and looked up and saw a very fast moving light, it was weird like it was crusing in a straight line fast but then all of a sudden it like turned straight down and it looked like it was heading straight down but it was maybe 10 times as fast as it was like it waqs falling. it was a tear drop like object. then we lost sight when we pases a tree and the building passsed and we lost sight of it. we both have no idea what we saw we couldnt explain it but it was moving faster than anything i have ever seen. and it was on a direct route to hit ground off in the distance;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
