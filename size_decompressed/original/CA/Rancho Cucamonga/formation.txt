Four shiny disc shaped objects flying in formation above the moutains and then disappeared.;2005-01-22 09:16:00;5 Seconds;Four shiny disc shaped objects flying in formation above the moutains and then disappeared. I was looking North from my patio toward the San Gabriel mountains. 4 disc shaped objects were seen traveling approximately West to East above the mountains. They were shiny and reflective, not unlike polished Aluminum. A small propeller aircraft just South of the mountains started to aproach from the East. The 4 objects dissapeared immediately as the aircraft came into view. I did not have time to photograph the incident.;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
