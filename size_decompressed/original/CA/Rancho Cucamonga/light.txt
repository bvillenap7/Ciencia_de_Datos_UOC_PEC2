We thought it looked like the object was falling apart. It had sparks coming from it and it was moving as if it was spinning. (The flight pattern was not straight, it was weaving.) Anyway, as we were watching this occur the bright light fluttered to nothing very quickly.;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
Light (s) routinely spotted from East to West during the past one an half years;2005-12-05 17:30:00;10 minutes;Light (s) routinely spotted from East to West during the past one an half years Ball of light, ususally one and sometimes two.  These have been seen for the past year and a half.  The ball appears high in the Eastern sky, estimated altitude of 100K ft. plus, at approximately 75 degrees and proceeds at a high rate of speed diagonally towards the southwest stops at my 110 degrees vertically and at approximately 25 degrees from my horizontal.  Somwhere over Los Angeles. It then makes a straight beeline towards the north, stops at approximately over La Canada or 10-15 degrees north of my horizontal and then heads east to the original point.  It will often stop and repeat the pattern or will execute a right turn and head straight south and out of sight.  Other times when it turns to the North it keeps on going until out of sight.  When there are two lights, they fly in irregular patterns and sometimes seem to go around in circles like they are chasing each other.  Then, one will stop and the other goes off to the South West.  Very seldom, a pulse trail appears when the light starts to move from a stopped position and it will also change to a dull orange or red color when it comes to a stop. The time of tracking is normally seconds ie. 5-10.  Sometimes, they move in straight lines, but most of the time, they travel in a slight waving pattern at a high rate of speed. I have been seeing this phenonomimum with both the naked eye (my vision is pretty close to 20/20) and with 7x35 W/A binoculars.  Last month, my son (age 25 and his friend (same age) also seen it with me at approx. 11:30 PM.  I have been spotting this light(s) on a routine basis, normally between 9-9:45 pm and again at between 11:00 and 11:45 pm.  Prior to this light(s) appearing in the night sky, nothing other than a shooting star had appeared until August of 2004.  At that time, I seen a dull red ball of light go lazily accross the sky from the East to the West at 8:45 pm and follow the same pie/wedge travel pattern. It traveled at approximately 110 degrees to my vertical of 90. The total time was maybe 3-4 minutes.  Thereafter, the light(s) began appearing.  I am no hokster.  I purposly kept this to myself and close confidents because of potential ridicule.  Hope you can explain what is going on.  I will give you my business address for your records.

Bright orange ball of light.;2007-04-07 22:45:00;5 seconds;About 23:45 hrs, my wife and I were sitting on the couch and overheard a commotion in our backyard. I turned off my TV to hear a group of people raising their voice. I walked to our backyard to find out what was going on and overheard a party adjacent to our house. I then heard several male adults yelling in a very excited voices,”What is that”? One male voice yelling, “I think it’s a hot air balloon”? And then another saying, “No way, it’s going to fast.” I walked out from under my patio cover and looked up towards Mt. Baldy area. The sky was overcast with low clouds. When I looked up, I caught a glimpse of a bright light through the cloud cover traveling from West to East. Just as I focused on it the light went out and then 2 seconds later it lit up again. It looked to me like a bright orange ball of light. It was traveling at a high speed parallel to the 210 FWY.  I know this was not a Jet airliner because of the speed, the close proximity to the mountains, and the absence of noise coming from it.;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
Light travelling, then glowing brightly and disappearing.  Saw 2 within 20 minutes.;2008-07-14 21:20:00;15 minutes;Light travelling, then glowing brightly and disappearing.  Saw 2 within 20 minutes. Phenomena or UFO? I saw three different lights within  a span of about 20 minutes. The first one was traveling west to east very high in the sky.  There were no blinking lights and it was well above the normal airline flight altitude so I assumed it was a satellite.  Then-it glowed very brightly and disappeared.  This was at approximately 9:20 pm. About 10 minutes later I observed another very high altitude light traveling north to south.  It looked like it was the same brightness, speed and height as the first light. It ended up just disappearing.  As I sat amazed not believing that I saw a second light, another light appeared same size, altitude and appearance traveling from west to east.  It also suddenly lit up very brightly then disappeared from sight. My home is in the Rancho Cucamonga area only about 8 miles northeast of Ontario International airport and these lights were nowhere near the normal flight pattern which was what first caught my attention.  The moon was over half full and blocked by a tree that was to the right of me so there was no moonlight interfering with what I saw.;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
Two star like bright lights moving in oppostie directions and one changing directions in the clear morning skies of  Rancho Cucamonga;2009-01-06 10:15:00;23 minutes;Two star like bright lights moving in oppostie directions and one changing directions in the clear morning skies of  Rancho Cucamonga At around 10:15 am on Tuesday Jan 6th 2009, my two year old daughter said look Mom it’s an airplane and I looked up and saw the air plan.  Then I noticed a very bright light that looked like a star way above the air plan.  As I thought in my head, this cant be a star, it started to move slowly to the east. Then I saw another light or star blink on in the same path as the first one but it was moving towards the west.  I was blown away at what I was witnessing, There were no wings or any airplane or helicopter features and no sound coming from the lights.  The only way I can describe them is they looked like stars or very bright points of light. The one moving to the west suddenly disappeared.  The one moving to the east was still moving slowly and then just stopped.  It stayed still for a few minutes and then started to move to the west.  I kept my eye on it as it kept going to the west until I could no longer see it past the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  One of four sightings submitted recently by same witness.

This is my second siting of this thing and I was ready with my camera.  It appeared high up in sky and moved very slow to the right and then to the left.  Then it moved until it was right straight above me, then it disappeared, and reappeared for about 10 minutes while I just kept on snapping shots with my camera.

Third sighting of a bright star like light changing colors blue and white moving across the morning sky in Rancho cucamonga;2009-01-08 09:30:00;30 minutes;Third sighting of a bright star like light changing colors blue and white moving across the morning sky in Rancho cucamonga On January 8, 2009 at 9:30 am I saw a bright star like light up in the sky.  This is my third sighting of this strange light in the skies above our park.   It traveled from East to West very slowly with no sound.   I watched and took pictures of it for 30 minutes as it passed over my head and out of view into the distance.   My Dad was with me this time and brought his binoculars.  Looking through the binoculars I could see some type of light around something moving.  It appeared to change colors from blue to white.   In the photos you can only see a small point of light.  I tried to zoom in on the photos to see if I could see more details, no luck.    One of the pictures surprised me, it shows at least 7 lights or orb’s.  This picture was taken when the light was above my head and I was under a tree.  I remembered that moment because when I looked at the light with my eyes it appeared to change color and shape or something.   It was so high up and you really couldn’t see a lot of details, but something was different.   Then to see the picture and see 7 lights or orb’s, that’s really scary. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness has forwarded four photographs, but none of them appears to us to illustrate the appearance of the object, as described above.  It looks somewhat like a bird, possibly a parrot, or maybe a hummingbird.  We do not know what the person witnessed.  PD));34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061

Bright light above the mountians north of Rancho Cucamonga;2009-02-19 03:15:00;20;Bright light above the mountians north of Rancho Cucamonga There was a very bright light hovering above part of a mountain north of Rancho Cucamonga. It was an orange/yellow light that would change to red and green. I first saw it when I was some 10 miles away and I drove right past it. It was to high off the mountain to be a communication tower, there is none there. It was to slow to be an airplane, and it was far and to windy in the Cajon Pass to be a helicopter. I drove on three sides of the mountain and the light never dimmed, nor did it look like it struggled to move in the wind like an aircraft would in such high wind. I watched it move slowly a few miles when I lost sight of it behind another mountain.;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
3 red triangle shaped lights in sky;2011-11-12 18:26:00;1 minute;3 red triangle shaped lights in sky I saw 3 lights in the shape of a triangle. They were located just west of me in the sky toward Los Angeles.  The lights all appeared to be red at first then they changed to bright orange. The top light at the top of the triangle began to pull into the sky but in the same location. The top light then disappeared and the bottom two point pulled into the top light as if they were sucked into the top of triangle. The bottom left light disappeared first and then the bottom right just after that.;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
4 lights appearing in and out of Rancho Cucamonga, CA.;2014-08-28 20:00:00;20-30 minutes;4 lights appearing in and out of Rancho Cucamonga, CA I was coming down from a hike off the Etiwanda Preserve Trail in Rancho Cucamonga.  My boyfriend first noticed the lights in the sky and it was odd that they weren't moving.  They didn't have the same lights that you would see on a helicopter and plane.    We saw planes coming in from a different direction as there is a airport near by.  However, unlike the airplanes, there was no movement, no change in size, and they would appear and disappear at the exact same location they had been originally.   The more we watched I noticed another light off in the distance doing the same thing.  The lights also didn't twinkle the same way as the lights in the city below did, they definitely had.  They seemed to have a more unstable light and more of pulsing light from them.  I would see them appear and disappear and not change location.   As they disappeared the light became more faint and pulsed more.   As we got in our car and went closer to the bottom of the mountain we noticed that! we were too low to see them (we originally knew they were low because we saw helicopters fly under them).   Here are a couple videos I recorded: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii6tTpMt01s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2L-RCHI40M;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061

Bright Orange Light moving in many directions over 210 Fwy.;2016-09-07 05:30:00;30 seconds;Bright Orange Light moving in many directions over 210 Fwy. I am a law enforcement officer and was leaving for work today, heading East on the 210 Fwy toward San Bernardino.  I noticed a bright orange light appear in the distance.  I estimated it to be at least 10 miles away and about 20-30 degrees from the horizon.  The light was stationary for a short time.  I watched the light thinking it was an aircraft turning on his landing lights.  Then at that moment it began to move in irregular directions at extremely fast speed.  I new at that time it was not a conventional aircraft or any type of drone because of the height, distance, and speed.  It was something I've never seen before.  The orange light returned to its original position and dimmed out.  I pulled my phone out to record the event if it happened again and unfortunately it never appeared again.  I was very excited to see such an event as this.  There were many cars on the freeway at the time and must have had numerous witnesses.;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
