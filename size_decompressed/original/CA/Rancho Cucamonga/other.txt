A green light like nothing I have seen before.;2014-12-14 21:30:00;2-3 seconds;A green light like nothing I have seen before. It was a green bright streak that flew no more than 40 feet above some houses.  I looked around and saw planes to try to match them together but no plane I've ever seen has flown this low.  I've seen meteor showers and comets but nothing compared to this.  It was so low to these houses.   The green light was maybe 100 yards away from me and disappeared as quickly as it came. I've never been a believer in ufo's and all that, but I cannot explain what I saw.  Like I said I have seen meteors before but nothing like this.;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
Mysterious star-like lights in the sky moving eastbound at a very high altitude.;2015-02-26 19:20:00;10 minutes;Mysterious star-like lights in the sky moving eastbound at a very high altitude. My husband, father in law, and I were outside and looked up in the sky and the big dipper looked flattened and very bright, then we realized it was moving... it wasn't the constellation, but it was several objects that looked like stars due to the altitude.  They continued to get higher and further east.  It appeared there were over 20 objects.  Moving rapidly, changing position as they propelled across the sky.
