fireball /2 nights in a row / no thanks!;2001-10-31 02:25:00;6 min.?;fireball /2 nights in a row / no thanks! This is the 2nd night that we saw the orange/glowing light . we saw it the night before at a earlier time. I reported it on this site the first time. the next time we saw it it came from the north, moving upward from the mountians then over twards the east & it stayed there for the longest in one spot,until the clouds covered it.The night before this ,it was about 10:30pm & that only lasted about 3mins.That one was north/by the mountains a little twards the west. it moved kinda jerky & seemed to be letting off sparks & then it had a big spark and began to drop, kinda like a firework drops when its done exploding.but this object faded & went back up a little,then sparked some more,dropped again & fadded out with dim sparks..??I was not comfortable with this whole siting! I can't find any reasonable explanation for it & do not want to tell anybody that I personally know about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source chooses to remain anonymous.

Unusual object dropped from airplane, lit up half of the sky.;2004-09-15 21:30:00;3 seconds;Unusual object dropped from airplane, lit up half of the sky. We were in the mountains and I noticed out of the corner of my eye an airplane flying overhead east of us.  It flew just past the mountain next to us and dropped something that was lit up as it fell to the ground.  As soon as it hit the ground it seemed to explode, causing an enormous flash on the other side of the mountain.  I know its not really a UFO sighting but it was a damn unusual sighting, so I figured I'd put it up here. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
A large object, engulfed in flames, chillingly drifts along Rancho Cucamonga foothills.;2015-01-12 19:40:00;8 minutes;A large object, engulfed in flames, chillingly drifts along Rancho Cucamonga foothills. I stepped out to my car to grab some items and my attention was instantly drawn to the northern foothills, a solid mass engulfed in flames was drifting in a slow upward ascend.  It seemed huge, like the size of a mini van.   Judging by the foothills in the background, it had to have been a couple thousand feet climbing to the upper atmosphere, where it gently faded into nothing.  We noticed it re- ignited about a mile east, for a minute or so, then it disappeared when commercial aircraft was near its proximity.   I still have the chills going through my body from seeing that..;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
