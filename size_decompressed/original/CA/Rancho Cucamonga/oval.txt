The object floated on the sky making no noise whatsoever;2003-07-12 18:00:00;twenty minutes;The object floated on the sky making no noise whatsoever I was on a staircase on a three story apartment divide smoking with a friend of mine. The apartent complex has a clear view of some of the foothills in california's inland empire, real close to them also. i noticed something come from over the mountains to the west of the peak. it was raising in altitude. it had an oval shape, i kept looking at it to see if it would turn and i would be able to tell if it be a plane or helicopter. no it wouldnt it had a dull silver color to it. it went pretty high up and proceeded to move east over the mountains, near the end of the mountains it started going , away from them to the east of us. as if it was making a giant circle around the valley. we kept an eye on it so one of us could go find something to zoom in on it, couldnt . my friend lost visual with it but i still had it for a while. then i lost it, it made no noise whatsoever which is why i started being suspicious of it.

Glowing orange orb in the sky...;2007-08-18 03:00:00;10 minutes;Glowing orange orb in the sky... I went outside and looked up into the sky to see what my friend was making such a big fuss over. That is when I saw the bright orange thing in the sky. It was closer than I had ever seen it before. It stayed in the same spot for probably about 3-4, doing absolutely nothing. Then it began to flicker and it seemed to be swinging something around itself that had 3 smaller bright orange things attached to it. That lasted about a minute and then it began to quickly move south. All of a sudden it stopped moving again and started to flicker once more. This time it began dropping what looked like little orange lights for about 5 seconds and then grew dim. It flickered again and got brighter and then began dropping little orange lights once more, but this time it began falling rapidly too. After about 10-15 seconds later it flickered and disappeared.;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
Bright orange oval light seen dropping smaller lite objects and then disappeared.;2007-08-18 03:00:00;9 minutes;Bright orange oval light seen dropping smaller lite objects and then disappeared. My brother and I noticed a large, bright, orange, glowing light in the sky at about 3 am towards Mt. Baldy. It looked like pieces from the light were falling off or it might have been smaller, separate lit up objects that were dropping from it.  The falling objects disappeared quickly. The light at first appeared to be moving at a steady pace towards the North and upward but then suddenly started going South and coming down pretty low.  Then suddenly it disappeared.  I have witnessed the same orange light on at least 5 other occasions in the past 3 months.  The shape has always been the same but it has been much higher and moved in a diagonal zigzag much quicker then an air plane would be moving.  One time it was dropping something from it but it didnâ€™t look as if the objects being dropped were lit up because I only saw the light from the main glowing light reflecting off what was being dropped.  I have no idea what this light could have been and other then these occasions I have never seen anything like it in the sky. If there is some explanation for it please let me know. Thank you;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
Small Oval Like Object Splits Into Two and Zips Back and Forth from in Under 3/12 Minutes Over San Gabriel Mountains.;2018-01-13 20:00:00;3 minutes;Small Oval Like Object Splits Into Two and Zips Back and Forth from in Under 3/12 Minutes Over San Gabriel Mountains. During the evening while sitting around our fire pit, my family and I noticed a small yellow/orange oval-shaped object zipping across the night sky traveling well over the normal speed of a plane/jet or fighter jet.  Going from left to right (W to E) from our perspective, it was zipping across the top of the San Gabriel Mountains. As crazy as it sounds, once it just got passed Cajon Pass, the oval-shaped object split into two.  When this occurred, the second object became red and both the yellow/orange and red object looped around in a full complete circle. Once the object meets up with one another during the course of the loop, the object became one again only making the yellow/orange oval shape visible and flew back westward towards Mt. Baldy.  When it got past Mt. Baldy, the object seemed to have vanished, not to be seen by our eyes any longer. We tried to capture what we were seeing via our cell phones, as we didn't have a camera on hand, but we were to far away for our cameras to capture the oval-shaped object. This all occurred in under 3 and half minutes (31/2 minutes);34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
