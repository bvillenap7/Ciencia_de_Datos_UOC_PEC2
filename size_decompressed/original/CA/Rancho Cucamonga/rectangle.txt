In mid June 2003, my co worker and I were preparing to leave his house to go to work when he noticed a bright orange object moving through the sky at a slow pace. The object appeared to be no more than several hundred feet in the air. The reason we believe this to be the case is due to heavy clown cover on this particular evening and the object was below the clouds. While observing the object we kept commenting on the way the object was rectangular in shape and was a bright orange glow almost the color of a street lamp. However, the edges of the object appeared to be emitting what looked like flames also, we noticed the object did not dim nor brighten as it moved across the sky. The object also appeared to be rotating in a slight circular motion as it passed overhead. (Perhaps 15 deg) Usually when you see an airplane approaching from a distance the headlights of the airplane or bright from a distance and then dim and fade away until you only see the marker lights after it eventually passes. In this case the object stayed at the same intensity from the moment we noticed it, until it moved beyond the horizon to the east.  Neither my self nor my coworker has seen anything similar to this in the past. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
Rectangle shaped UFO with red, green and white lights in Rancho Cucamonga;2013-08-06 22:45:00;1 minute;Rectangle shaped UFO with red, green and white lights in Rancho Cucamonga I was outside watering my plants by the pool at 10:45pm.  The pool lights were on.  I thought what I first saw were airplane lights, however the object kept getting closer.  It looked rectangle in shape with red, green, and white lights.  I don't remember seeing any blinking lights.  It looked approximately 3-4 feet in length and 3 feet wide.  It was doing loops in the sky sort of falling for a bit and looping back upward.  I thought it was maybe a remote controlled device but there were no sounds of a motor.  It was completely quiet.  It looked like it was coming towards me (or the house or the pool lights!) so I dropped the hose and ran inside to get my son.  When he came out, it was gone.
