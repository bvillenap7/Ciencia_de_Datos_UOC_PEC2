I fetched my binoculars and the best I can say was that there were 7 lights that were changing colors- red, blue, purple, but mostly green with a white light in the center.  The object moved around and eventually dipped out of sight. Lasted 45 minutes. I did not detect a body of the craft but it was the fast flashing lights and there were 7 major lights in a circle.  Strange whatever it was. I have video too but it is indistinct.  Only with binos could I make out the detail.  And it was still for a long time but when it moved, it covered space rather quickly.  Would be seen by others in area, northern sky, and not very high in the sky;34.1123690997566;-117.584320519061
