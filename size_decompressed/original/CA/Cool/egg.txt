Both craft can change shape and position, but do so slowly, mostly itâ€™s the craft on the left that changes. The larger craft on the right is usually an ellipse and has perfectly spaced white lights all around the perimeter of the craft, very bright ( because the immediate area around the craft is also lit up. My house faces true N and I would say that these craft lay about 315 degrees west. These sightings are almost perpetual except when overcast and nothing is visible. One night I observed  the craft at about 270 degrees due west. I thought 2 stars in conjunction, but the very well spaced. extremely bright lights refutes that. Next supposition, a launched satellite, human made. But, since their power source is solar, they may not want to waste power  lighting up the exterior. However that could be the the orders of Ground Control. They are not towers, no red light. I have seen a beautiful green tubular UFO years ago. but this thing is totally different.;38.892;-120.9794
