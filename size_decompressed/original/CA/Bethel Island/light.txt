a light in the sky moving fast and disappering;2004-08-20 22:00:00;15 sec;a light in the sky moving fast and disappering it was about 10 o'clock at night and i was having a smoke at the back of my property before going to bed (something i do often). i was almost finished when i notice something strange in the sky. a light in the shape of an orb appeared high in the sky (about a mile or so), as soon as it appeared it stayed in one place for a second or so and then spead off at a high rate of speed across the sky. when it moved it accelarated to top speed almost instantly and held the same rate of speed the whole duration of flight. i appeared in the west end of the sky and moved toward the south end, it flew paralle with the ground and toward the end made about a 20 degree angle up then blinked out. the duration of flight was also about 2 to 3 seconds and it left no trail or streek behind as a falling star would. it also flew perfectly straight lines with no arc and made the turn up at a sharp angle, the flight path on paper would look like a line bent upwards at the end. it also blinked out instantly, it did't fade out or dim at all. i often smoke outside at night and see falling stars (meteors) and satellites all the time, i also know the flight paths of all the air routes for planes in my area. it's the only ufo i've seen in this area or in my life.;38.0266;-121.6425
