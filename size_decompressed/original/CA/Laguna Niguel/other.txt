Two bright reddish orange lights moving slowly over Laguna Niguel.;2013-05-09 20:30:00;10 minutes;Two bright reddish orange lights moving slowly over Laguna Niguel I saw two reddish orange objects moving slowly in what could described as floating flares in the night sky at an angle of about 45 degrees viewing angle looking to the north of my position. I couldnt tell the altitude or distance from my position.  For a brief time I thought I saw what appeared to be an aircraft flying close to the objects.  The aircraft had standard navigation lights and flew near the objects for about two minutes after which it flew away towards the west. The two objects moved very slowly in concert with one another then they moved apart. One of the objects then flickered and appeared to float downwards.  The other object flickered about 1 minute later then it moved towards the west before what appeared to be a flameout.  In all, I watched the scenario for  about  7 or 8 minutes.;33.5192070422535;-117.713612676056
