The flash was like a comet with a head and long tail.  It was in the southeastern part of the sky in Orange County California.  It was traveling from east to south, parallel to the horizon.

Four unmoving orange spheres sighted over Orange County, CA.;2014-06-18 20:00:00;2.5 hours;Four unmoving orange spheres sighted over Orange County, CA. We live on a hill with about 200 degrees visibility of unobstructed skyline from the mountains to the ocean. On June 18, 2014, I went to bed at 8 pm with a headache.  I looked out the window and saw a bright orange light in the sky, which at first glance I assumed to be the moonrise, a bit south of east. I realized the light wasn't as large as the moon.  I then thought I was looking at a plane flying in my direction, since it appeared not to move.  But it was a single large orange light, not the multiple white and/or red lights of a plane.  After about a minute of bright stillness, it seemed to collapse in on itself and disappear. It was odd, but I thought maybe it was a weird reflection, or projection or a helicopter.  I dismissed it and fell asleep.  I'm an artist, with a vivid imagination, and so didn't take the sighting seriously. At 1030 pm, I woke up and looked out the window.  To my surprise, the same light was there again.  My husband walked into the room and I asked him to verify what I was seeing.  He agreed that it looked like an incredibly bright, fiery, unmoving orange ball and was nothing he'd seen before.  A software engineer by trade, he is also unrelentingly logical. As we watched, another orange light appeared to the north of the first.  A few seconds later, the first light went out.  I got up and got my binoculars and looked at the object.  I couldn't see much detail--it was a large ball of fire, unmoving, with smoke trails. My husband looked through the binoculars and saw the same thing--an unmoving fiery ball with smoke trails.  He took a video with his iPhone, showing one light going out after another has appeared, but the video doesn't portray well the size, brightness or orange color of the lights. A third light appeared further to the north and the second light went out.  When the third light went out, no other lights appeared and we went to sleep. There is a military base about forty miles to the southeast of us, so our assumption is that it is unknown military tech, but we have no expertise in this regard.;33.5192070422535;-117.713612676056
4 Orange fire orbs in the sky.;2016-06-11 22:00:00;3 minutes;4 Orange fire Orbs in the Sky I stepped outside to have a cigarette with my girlfriend and she said what is that light in the sky? It appeared to be an orange fire orb, circle in shape with no flashing lights and completely silent unlike a plane.  Best way I can describe was almost like a low pulsing circle flame.  The cloud layer was super thick and a break in the cloud allowed for this low flying fire orb to come through the cloud from the direction of the ocean and head northeast. The fireball flew what appeared to be extremely low, lower then any plane and then appeared to speed up and continue below the clouds for apprx one min and them disappeared off in the distance.  I only say disappeared because the flame went out making the orb no longer visible. Approximately 30 seconds later another fire orb appeared at same altitude but much faster across the sky, them 2 more fire orbs back to back with the same altitude equally spaced apart came across the sky.  All four came from the same direction and had the same exact formation as the previous fire orb, I have never seen anything like that.  Complete silence with a bright light in the sky visible and then just disappeared as if the fire flame was turned off.  At first I chalked it up to a flare from a military plane but the more i thought about I realized that flares don't follow each other back to back across the sky in the same formation and exact same direction.
