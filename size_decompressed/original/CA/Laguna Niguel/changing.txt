Laguna Niguel CA 3 lights moving from same point on the horizon to differnt points in space.;2004-11-18 20:10:00;4 minutes;Laguna Niguel CA 3 lights moving from same point on the horizon to differnt points in space. My wife and I where sitting out side on our balcony facing south next the the 73 toll road in southern orange county in southern California it is a clear night and we just talked about looking at the meteor shower tonight with an expected peek around 1:00am 11/19/2004 PST. I was the first one to see them and told my wife to quick come over and look at what I see. We saw three very fast moving lights when we first saw them they looks like they started at the same point on the horizon moving in a erratic (from left to right and up and down while moving north to North east and out away from earth pattern they looked like they came from the pacific down south of us and was moving from left to right and the two lights on the left took turns taking the lead and the 3rd light moved more to the south east and out and as the other two went more north and out I say they went out because the lights looks like they got smaller but still did not move in a straight line within 4 minutes the lights seemed to fade into the background of space. My wife and I were so freaked out we came inside to turn on the TV.;33.5192070422535;-117.713612676056
