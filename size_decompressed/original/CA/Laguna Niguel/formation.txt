Orange Orbs in Orange County;2010-07-13 23:34:00;10 seconds;Orange Orbs in Orange County I was driving down Niguel Road in Laguna Niguel, California at 11:34pm.  As I was driving, I witnessed 4 large orange orbs in formation floating up in the sky off in the distance.  I slowed my car to get a good look.  The formation appeared to be stationary. I returned to the same location where I made the initial observation in 6 minutes later, but they had vanished.;33.5192070422535;-117.713612676056
