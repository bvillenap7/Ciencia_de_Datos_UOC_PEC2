Bouncing orange lights in night sky.;1998-10-15 21:15:00;1 minute;Bouncing orange lights in night sky. I had returned home from work and as I crossed the street to my my condominium something made me turn around and look up into the sky.They were orange balls of light that bounced along through the night sky like flying tumbleweeds. It was very overcast and windy (Santa Ana winds) and they appeared to be eithor in the clouds or above them shining lights down.They made no sounds.They moved in a general north to south flight. I looked around for other witnesses but no one else was around. I watched them.After a minute or so, I looked around again for another witness and when I looked back at the sky the lights had gone.
