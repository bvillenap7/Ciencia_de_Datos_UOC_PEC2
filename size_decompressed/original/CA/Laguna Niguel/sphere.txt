I know it was a comercial airliner because the travel the same route every night. Anything that is that close to a big plane couldn't fly because it would be in the planes wake!;33.5192070422535;-117.713612676056
I was lying down, and I look in the sky. I see a sphere and I thought it was a plane. I look closely, but I see it is not like a plane ;2000-01-28 20:58:00;about 30 seconds;I was lying down, and I look in the sky. I see a sphere and I thought it was a plane. I look closely, but I see it is not like a plane or helicopter. I look and it is going back not in a straight line, but moving back in a little circular mode. It is bigger than a star, smaller than a moon. I know it was not a plane or anything like that. The object looked like a sphere. It was moving back in a circular mode toward the mountain. It seemed like it was going fast and was going farther from my site. I ran to get a binocular but it was gone. I got my mom and she came too, but it was not there. The object seemed to have several orangish lights. I know it could not be a plane or helicopter. After the object was gone, I looked in the sky also, and it seemed like there was some redish cloud, not to red but it seemed a different form of color and the object was moving that way. I am not bsing at all and please call me or anything if you need any more information. I can talk to you on the phone etc. Thank you very much. (I have ocean view and it was to a canyon and that is where I saw it);33.5192070422535;-117.713612676056
Silver ball in California's Sky.;2012-09-14 17:00:00;20 minutes;Silver ball in California's Sky. I was lying by my pool looking up, not able to take a nap, just kept looking up, clouds passing byand it was rather enertaining as I very seldom look up, I saw planes go by some left a trail others did not. Then I noticed the silver ball going by very slowly across the clouded sky from one extreme to the other {Left to Right } it stopped twice and then in continued its linear trayectory, I even took a picture with my mobile phone thinking it wouldn't come out but when I enhanced it on my lap top there it was. I know about you from C2CAM and I thought I report this. Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.5192070422535;-117.713612676056
