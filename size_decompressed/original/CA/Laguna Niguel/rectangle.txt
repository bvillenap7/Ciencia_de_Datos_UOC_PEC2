A brief experience with a reflective surface in the sky.;2002-06-24 16:15:00;10 seconds;A brief experience with a reflective surface in the sky. I was sitting next my brother while we were driving home from an early dinner, I saw what seemed like a flat reflective shape in the sky.  I thought it was a kite at first and pointed at it, so my brother could witnessed also and tell me what it is. By the time he could look in the right area of the sky it disappeared.  I tried to take a picture at the time and kept looking to see if it would reflect again at a different angle, but it was just gone. It might not have a genuine UFO, but if was something I could not explain. Just doing my part in reporting anything. I have a degree in Management Information Systems, and am working on getting my MCSE (Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer).

Three Orange Spheres in a Rectangular  Cluster with a Pulsating Sphere on the Right Side;2013-11-19 19:50:00;10 minutes;Three Orange Spheres in a Rectangular  Cluster with a Pulsating Sphere on the Right Side My sister and I were walking our dog.  It was a clear crystal night with no clouds in the sky.  There was a cluster of three orange spheres in a rectangular shape.  These spheres remained in a hovering position.  The spheres were very close together and maintained a hazy appearance.  On the right portion of the rectangle, there was a pulsating sphere.   We went to go show our friend and not even two minutes later, coming back to the exact same spot, the lights were gone.;33.5192070422535;-117.713612676056
