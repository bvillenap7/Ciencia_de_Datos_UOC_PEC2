PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;15 minutes;the sighting was aprox 1 hour ago and I am still a little startled and excited. I just picked up my wife from work and was heading home from Aliso Viejo to Laguna Niguel. Driving a Toyota pick up with my wife in the passenger seat and my 11 year old son in the rear seat behind my wife heading south west on Alicia Ave I spotted what appeared to be a small aircraft with a bright light shining from behind the aircraft moving at a slow speed. I figured it was a helicopter and asked my wife to look at it. her response was surprising. She had a better view of the object and became very startled at what she was seeing. the object began to take a crescent pattern and then went dark. The three of us where puzzled at what we just observed and was discussing what we had just seen. the object then re-appeared in a different location bigger and brighter than before it then flew in the sky and justed stopped. at that point it shined a light from it much like a police helicopter but the light did not reach the ground. the light shined and stopped about 20 meters behind it. at that point a cloud formed around it that had a green color to it. the object stopped moving and the light dimmed and the cloud disappeared but didn't disapate. The news is already reporting that it was a missile test out of Edwards. NO WAY WAS THAT A MISSILE TEST! I have seen my share of missile test and that was no missile test.
