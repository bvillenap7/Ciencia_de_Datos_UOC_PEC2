At exactly 1130 pm I was pointing out Ursa Major to my fiancee',facing due west,looking directly up when 2 disc-like objects coming from the N/NE passed my field of vision at the lower portion of the constellation.The objects were entirely parallel with one another(side to side)until I lost sight of them in the S/SW horizon.The estimated duration of my sighting was 4-5 seconds.The objects were yellowish-white in color,leaving no trail,no sound at all.Having a general understanding of aerial velocities of man-made devices,I can assure you these were not satellites nor were they anything like a meteor.I suppose if what I saw was singular rather than multiple,and flying in an intelligent formation at high speed,well,I guess I would've gone to bed instead of phoning you good people.;33.6722021276598;-117.909802523506
Large dark gray object hovering in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Amended by witness.  Object was a blimp.  PD));2017-11-03 08:15:00;2 hours;Large dark gray object hovering in the sky While driving to work at 8:15 this morning, I noticed an unusual shape in the sky.  Because there were a lot of clouds, I initially thought it was a unique, very dark gray cloud formation.  When I was stopped at a red light, I could get a better look at it, and it was clear that it was not a cloud.  It was an object hovering in the sky.  I thought at first it might be an oddly shaped blimp, but there are frequently blimps in this area and Iâ€™d never seen one with this shape.  This was much more flattened and wider than a blimp.  I could make out what I thought were darker demarcations of some sort on it.  It was mostly hovering, but could have been moving toward the west very, very slowly.   When I got to work, I found that 4 other people had seen it also.  At a little after 10:00 a.m., someone came in talking about it because they had just been looking at it still.  When I went out to look again at 10:15 it was no longer there. ((NUFORC Note:  We have encouraged the witness to contact the local FAA Flight Service Station, to inquire whether a blimp was in the area, and perhaps in touch with the local airport tower or ATC.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi- This morning I reported what I thought was a UFO sighting - I have since found out that it was some unusual blimp flying over a convention for Blizzcon -  put on by Blizzard video game company. Just wanted to clarify/update my report. ((END ADDENDUM)).;33.6722021276598;-117.909802523506
