Many orange red globes in the night sky over orange county california.;2013-09-01 22:00:00;7 minutes;Many orange red globes in the night sky over orange county california My mom was getting into her car and I heard her saying something over and over loudly.  I returned and heard her saying What is that!! over and over.  I looked east and saw in the sky a very large amount of orange/red globes hovering in the sky.  Some were closer and others were father away, in at least 3 layers back into the night sky. The close ones seemed to be usually close, and there were so many of them, that I considered that we were under attack, but they weren't moving quickly.  They were basically not moving, or moving very slowly.  I went into the house to get my camera.  When I got back my mom explained that most of them had left.  3 remained which were in a diagonal line rather than the triangle formation that I noticed earlier.  One vanished and another seemed to rise from the horizon.;33.6722021276598;-117.909802523506
Oval shaped, brightly lit, moving slowly.;2015-12-21 07:30:00;2 minutes;Oval shaped, brightly lit, moving slowly. Spotted bright oval shaped craft moving north to south slowly in the morning.   From My point in Costa Mesa, it looked to be over Santa Ana, or Tustin.  About 6 or 7 miles from me.   Brightly lit, not moving fast.  Went behind a low hanging cloud.;33.6722021276598;-117.909802523506
Strange, white, glowing, moving lights where seen by at least 5 people during the day.;2016-08-03 13:36:00;10 minutes;Strange, white, glowing, moving lights where seen by at least 5 people during the day. On August 3, 2016, I was driving to a recycling center in Costa Mesa, when I saw 2 rectangular wall shapes made up of white circles.  One wall was coming in from the left and the other from the right and they looked like they were going to collide with each other.  Suddenly, they came together into a huge ball and then split like atoms.  I saw the individual white circles glow like flames as I was approaching the recycling center. I parked my car, grabbed my cell phone and started to record the lights move in a dance. Some white lights glowed brighter than others.  The lights looked like alternating flames of brightness.  I screamed and told folks to look up.  All the people ran and stared.  At first, we thought the lights were balloons until the alternating light and dance happened in unison.  Folks grabbed their phones and started screaming and filming.  The man filming next to me can be heard saying “there’s too many of them” and I can be heard agreeing with him.  I was very excited. It was impossible to count how many crafts there were.  I estimated about 15. A few minutes later, they started leaving as they ascended past the clouds.  Only one lingered behind, sitting on top of a cloud.  After all the others were gone, the one that stayed behind flashed and disappeared!!!  The video footage I posted was slowed down so that you can see the white lights.  When played in slow motion, you can see some of the lights glowing. I paused the one light that lingered above the cloud.  Look at it on the left. The sun was too harsh and made it difficult to capture the video.  This is why my camera is moving so much.  I have been following these lights for over 4 years now.  Most of my encounters have been at night.  This encounter, however, is the biggest cluster of lights I’ve come across.;33.6722021276598;-117.909802523506
