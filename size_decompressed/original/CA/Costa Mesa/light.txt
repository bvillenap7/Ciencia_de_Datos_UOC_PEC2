Object was fairly still, however would make unusually sharp moves on occasions.;1999-10-26 02:38:00;1hr(still occuring);Object was fairly still, however would make unusually sharp moves on occasions. At about 0130 26 October 1999, I noticed an unusually bright object in the sky. Located approximately. 20deg up from the horizon, E-N-E. It was (seemed) to change colors and was very high. A few minutes later I noticed a fast streak of light that flew quickly in front of it. That could have just been a meteor going by, but this other object that is in the sky even now, I can not identify. Could it be a satellite? I hope so. Or else we have some very curious people or a curious life form out there. There are no telephone numbers for reporting this kind of incident and the local police (non-emerg.) were only interested, if the object lands.

star-like objects in changing formations;2003-04-26 21:30:00;30 minutes;star-like objects in changing formations I was looking out from my driveway on a clear and starry night when I observed a formation of 4 more or less stationary bright orange objects hovering over the ocean south of my house. I pointed them out to my girlfriend, who was also in the driveway and then we observed them for several minutes. They moved into several different formations. One of the young people from the neighborhood was walking by while speaking with his girlfriend on a cell phone. The girlfriend was 5 miles north of our location. We pointed the objects out to him, and he described them to his girlfriend, who looked from her window and also saw them. The objects faded away gradually after a while and then 3 of them reappeared about 5 degrees west of the spot from which they had disappeared. The 3 objects affected several changing formations over a period of several minutes, faded away, and to our knowledge, have not re-appeared.;33.6722021276598;-117.909802523506

4 Red UFO's drift over John Wayne Aiport;2012-06-27 22:15:00;15 min;4 Red UFO's drift over John Wayne Aiport I was talking with a friend on the front porch when in the corner of my eye i saw a bright red light, which my  sub conscious thought was a street light, but when i realized we were on a residential street I turned my head to look. I saw 4 brightly shining spherical craft in a vertical straight line solid in color and brightness drifting higher into the sky while dimming immediately to at least 3/4 the intensity. This happened in a matter of seconds and i stopped my friend mid sentence to have him see what i was seeing. They continued drifting higher and farther away towards the right, when they began to make an obtuse triangle shape.The lowest object drifted straight away from us while the other three went the other direction. At this point they were blinking red in color in a random sequence, they would all stay lit at different intervals from each other and would emit light for different amounts of time each time they did light up. They did this and drift! ed higher into the atmosphere until they vanished from sight. There was no sound, no smoke, and other air craft from John Wayne airport were still flying as if routine. I tried to take a video with my phone but only came up with some audio.;33.6722021276598;-117.909802523506
