Extremely fast, dark gray colored octagonal craft with equidistant dim red lights;2008-06-28 00:00:00;Approx 2 seconds;Extremely fast, dark gray colored octagonal craft with equidistant dim red lights Late Friday around midnight, or shortly after, I was lying on the roof here and gazing into the sky. I was lying in a position with feet pointed West, and I saw this crazy looking thing fly by from North to South WITHOUT making a sound. That was the first thing I found to be extraordinary for what I had just witnessed. It is a bit difficult to estimate its size, because it appeared to look as if it were at a relatively low altitude. The best way to describe the size I saw would be to say  it appeared to be about the size of my thumbnail at my arm's length. The object was flying VERY fast (i.e. I'd say it took approximately 2 seconds from the time I noticed it for it to have spanned about 120 degrees of arc) and flew only in a straight line at constant velocity. As for its appearance it was dark, dark gray with a shape looking like it could have been octagonal. There were lights of dim red in color in conic shape at each of the vertices pointing towards the center  This is definitely the most perplexing and incredible thing I've ever seen in the sky.  I attempted to draw an image, but I have to say the lighting was much dimmer than what I had drawn.  http://img127.imageshack.us/img127/5527/ufokr9.jpg;33.6722021276598;-117.909802523506
