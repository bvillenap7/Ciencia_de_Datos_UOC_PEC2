Conditions were sunny cloudless sky.  Elementary school field backs up to high school field and at about the middle of the combined ballfields I was compelled to look up.   his later became peculiar as I realized the entity had made no noise.  I was either preoccupied with entity and/or completly unaware of any outside stimuli ie/noise moving objects, etc.   About three telephone poles height above ground appeared a single spherical, spinning mercury like in appearrance entity or object. I procceeded to observe this object while lying on my back on the grass of the field.  It seemed to spin at a regular pace but sort of pulsed as a heart might.  The entity certainly was at least aware of my presence as it moved jn an unnatural process from a distance within my perceivable range of sight [without moving my head] to the right and then left of the center with ease. Then it came closer and then farther and was kind of putting on a show of its capabilities.  Suddenly it was gone as if it disappeared into thin air.
