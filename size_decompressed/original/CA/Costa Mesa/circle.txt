round  object seen in costa mesa flying;2007-07-21 22:20:00;20 -30 min;round  object seen in costa mesa flying We were at a concert at the OC fair. The whole stadium saw an object flying in the sky that appeared round with bright white lights in a circular pattern. It seemed to glide in the sky with ease. Just sorta hoovering yet gliding in a round pattern. It disappeared for about 5 minutes and reappeared it was up there for 20-30 minutes.  I have never seen anything like this before!!;33.6722021276598;-117.909802523506
Blue ring object seen hovering above the Costa Mesa area;2007-09-21 22:45:00;about 3-5 minutes;Blue ring object seen hovering above the Costa Mesa area Last night, around 10:45 PM, I was outside my house when I saw a bizarre hovering light. I live in Santa Ana, California, but the object was southwest from my position, into the Costa Mesa area.  The only visible part of the object was a solid bright bluish ring. A storm was approaching in the distance and it was slightly windy, so at first I thought it might be something floating in the wind. It's movement was very fluid, but still fairly erratic. The movement pattern almost looked like a plastic bag caught in an updraft of air. But, it wasn't very long before I realized that it was way too big to be something floating in the wind. It looked to be flying at a fairly low altitude, around the height that a helicopter might fly, but it's maneuverability was beyond anything I've ever seen a helicopter do. It slowed to a hover, then dove in an arc and came back up a few times, both horizontally and vertically. The speed at which it could turn made me think it might be a radio controlled airplane, but I've never seen one a big as this. It had no lights on it other than a blue/white ring on the bottom. When it tilted away from my perspective, the ring was not visible. Conversely, when it tilted towards my direction, the ring shined brightly.  It continued to move around the area for a few minutes, and then dropped it's altitude to a point where I could no longer see it, and I lost sight of it after that.  My mother was also outside at the time, and also witnessed the object. But unfortunately, I was unable to get a picture or video of the event.;33.6722021276598;-117.909802523506
I was at work in Costa Mesa, CA.  Just happened to look up a what appeared to be 5 objects, one brighter and bigger then the rest.;2015-01-17 15:40:00;20 minutes;At 3:45 pm 1/17/15, I was at work in Costa Mesa, CA.  Just happened to look up a what appeared to be 5 objects, one brighter and bigger then the rest, moving along all together.   At first, I thought looks to be balloons, but I've seen balloons, and this was not any type of balloon or balloons I've seen before.   There were 5 surrounding the bigger brighter one and moving around and away from the bigger one and at times the smaller ones would move closer the chase the other ones away and move above the a 7th one came right through the middle as if they were playing they would move into a triangle.;33.6722021276598;-117.909802523506

It had red and green lights.  It made pends no noise at all.   My dad listened to C2C and told me about this site.  I want to see if anyone else saw it.
