Organic UFO over Orange County.  ((NUFORC Note:  Object may be a string of balloons, in our opinion.  PD));2007-04-06 13:00:00;6 hours;Organic UFO over Orange County A tadpole or fish shaped thing hovered high over the John Wayne Airport for 6 hours. It released and received spherical objects the entire time it was up there. ((NUFORC Note:  Object may be a string of balloons, in our opinion.  We have corresponded with the photographer, who disagrees strongly with our assessment.  We have asked whether he made any attempt to contact the airport about the object, but so far, we have received no answer.  He is very critical of our assessment of the photograph.

On 12-11-2015 at 2119 hours, I witnessed a single white light streak heading South at an undetermined high altitude while watching from my backyard in Costa Mesa, CA.   The light continued heading South across the sky until the object made a 90-degree, instantaneous, turn West. I know of no plane or meteor or other man-made object which could perform such a maneuver.   Total view time was approximately one minute.;33.6722021276598;-117.909802523506
