The craft was giving off a hypnotic blinking in a circular paternity around the craft..  The lights looked like a soft white and red LED type of light pattern..  The craft had no real rhyme or reason to its pathâ€¦  It moved in various patterns as well as holding position up to 45secs to almost 2 minutes at a time.  The craft continued this behavior for another 20 minutes until it finally started to drift off, fade, and eventually disappear.  At this moment, it almost seemed that the sky became really clear, and the stars were more visible then they have been in the past few nights.
