cluster of objects in the sky for about 1 hour.;2009-02-01 15:00:00;1 hour;cluster of objects in the sky for about 1 hr Approximately 2009 I was flying a kite with my child at my parents home using a fishing reel and using two roles of string. The kite was soo far away that all I could see  was a small dot on the sky. Every few minutes I would lose site of the kite and had to scan the sky for it. On one of this occasions as I was looking for the kite I came upon a strange site in the sky. I saw multiple dots in the sky approximately one dot surrounded by about eight dots. At first I thought that they where air crafts, for the reason that my parents live close to LAX and there is an air route over head. After a few minutes I continue to focus on the clusters of dots even after bring in the kite.  In my mind I thought they where aircraft as I use to observe them during my time as an Air Traffic Controller at a tower. But the cluster of dots did not move or change pater, then i thought that it was a combination of planes and aircraft in the distance but they would still not move. After about half an hour I decided to look for my camera to use the zoom lens to see if I could identify the dots. After looking for my camera I found a different camera that was a digital with auto zoom. I started to scan the sky to look for the dots that where originally in a circle but I found that  the dots started to skater. I attempted to use the focus on the camera but the dots would not come in to focus. Eventually I took some pictures but all I can see are dots in the sky being skater. As the dots held in place for close to an hour I do know that they where not airplanes or planets/stars. After a few minutes I was unable to find the dots and I was not able to take the picture of the ! cluster when they were form in to a circle;33.9277;-118.2034
