Suddenly the blue thing turned into a perfectly straight and square orange bar.  there was also a metallic disc under it that faded in and out of sight. At 1:45AM this morning a friend and I were driving down Ventura Blvd in Encino.  We saw an object in the sky that looked like a star.  Suddenly a long comet-like tail appeared behind it.  It was long, thin and very bright.  Instantly, it turned from a blue tail to a perfectly square and straight bar that was mostly orange.  At times, the point of light looked as if it had a very smooth metallic object below it.  The light and disc were almost surreal.  It faded in and out as if maybe it was bordering our visual spectrum or something.  As we were driving from Encino to Woodland Hills, it shifted position in relation to us.  It moved from in front of us to behind us in that 10-mile drive, meaning that it must have been very close to us.;34.166344402985;-118.508209701493
Blue/green spherical craft seen from Ventura Freeway in Encino, CA;2001-05-22 21:40:00;ten seconds;Blue/green spherical craft seen from Ventura Freeway in Encino, CA While traveling west on the Ventura Freeway in the city of Encino, a bright blue/green light caught my eye. I watched it for a few seconds and pointed it out to my husband who was sitting next to me (he was the passenger, I was the driver) and he saw it immediately.  This round shaped object traveled faster than any plane, but slower than a meteorite, was not a plane or helicopter.  We watched it fly westwards towards the Malibu area in an arc, and vanish in the sky.  Immediately afterwards, I saw two helicopters flying, coming from the southwest to north flashing their lights. The helicopters were lower and closer than the craft we saw.  I had the feeling these helicopters had seen the object and were trying to find it, can't say why I had the feeling - just did.;34.166344402985;-118.508209701493
