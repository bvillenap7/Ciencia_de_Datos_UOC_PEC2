Strange cloud formation.;2018-05-15 12:00:00;~30 minutes;Strange cloud formation While driving from Sherman Oaks to Thousand Oaks mid day a short rainfall happened to me on the Ventura Freeway.  I thought the sunlight through the clouds looked rather strange but beautiful so I took a quick picture.  It wasn’t until a few days later I tried working with the contrast of the picture when I noticed this very strange “cloud formation.”  I’m not sure what it is but it certainly isn’t natural!
