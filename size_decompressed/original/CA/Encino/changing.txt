What appeared to be a white triangular craft rotating and had appeared in the same location I had seen on one other occasion.  Though previously the craft did not travel across the sky, and was just hovering for a few mins and then vanished within secs. This sighting lasted about 20 mins, slowly making its way from the Eastern sky crossing diagonally to the Western sky. I was able to photograph a series of images, on a standard DSLR camera w/ 18-55MM lens so it was hard to catch the details of the craft. After the sighting, and upon inspection of the images, it's clear that the object was shape-shifting from Triangle to V to Ball of light. During the course of the migration across the sky there were airplanes, helicopters, birds flying in the shot, but I could not tell how high up the object was. It did pass through the clouds which were all wispy angel-like formations and surprisingly not many chemtrails today!  Also I observed what appeared to be a plasma field surrounding the object that looked like waves of energy that were actually affecting the clouds as it passed through. Video footage captures its movement, then holding position in the sky, changing direction and then continuing on the path from the East to West. The object made its way into the distance and visibility was lost.;34.166344402985;-118.508209701493
