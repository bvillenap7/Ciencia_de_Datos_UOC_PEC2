very large V shaped craft flys from horizon to horizon in 3 seconds, very low and silent (Los Angeles);1996-10-13 20:00:00;3 seconds;very large V shaped craft flys from horizon to horizon in 3 seconds, very low and silent (Los Angeles) My wife and I were stopped in our vehicle at a traffic light when a very large V shaped object flew by silently, and very very fast.  So fast that neither one of us said a thing, it had to be an illusion.  I fly airplanes and this was no airplane. It was flying at an altitude of about 300 feet, and appeared at least twice as big as a 747. The disturbing and creepy thing was that it was completely silent and traveled from horizon to horizon in about 3 seconds. The light turned green and we just sat there dumbfounded.  After a minute of silence, my wife said honey.....did you see what I just saw?   We went home and decided to each draw our version of what we saw without discussing it.  Of course our drawings were virtually the same: a large, V shaped craft, with 2 or 3 lights running down each vane of the V and a light at the apex or nose of the V.   It was black in color and the lights were a dull yellow or white.  Very freaky, almost disturbing to see something that big, so low, so fast.  The fact that is was so low (let alone silent) tells me that this was no black ops or Skunkworks test-bed. No military plane would ever fly this low over a very heavily populated area!  At any rate, we never reported it, as we figured no one would ever believe us.  Now, years later, I found a video on YouTube that got my interest going again, and I found this website.  Finally, we at least can document the evidence that filled our windshield on that day in 1996. FYI, the weather was completely clear. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));34.166344402985;-118.508209701493
Craft with 3 faint rectangle lights over Los Angeles;2002-06-18 21:00:00;1 minute;Craft with 3 faint rectangle lights over Los Angeles This object was visible only by the 3 faint,rectangle shaped, white lights. I live near an airport and am very aware of ordinary aircraft. These lights were much larger and much dimmer then any known aircraft. The size of the craft was similar to a B2, flying a few thousand feet up. I did not hear any noise, it flew at a similar speed to an aircraft. The night was absolutely clear, and I expected to see the craft, but could not see the body. There was a ripple effect as it passed distorting my view of the object (similar to how extreme heat distorts your view of an object.;34.166344402985;-118.508209701493
Blue and red triangular craft spotted red disc spotted soon after;2009-09-12 22:53:00;2 minutes each;Blue and red triangular craft spotted red disc spotted soon after At about 10:53 tonight, my mother called me outside to look at something. I stepped outside, and spotted a blue and red triangle of lights in the sky, looking about 2 or 3 miles away. It was mostly blue, with a red tip, and it seemed to float down, like a leaf. It disappeared behind the treeline. Not ten minutes later, we spotted a second craft, a ring of red flickering lights, moving far too fast and in a far too erratic fashion to be a plane or helicopter. Both crafts made a distinct humming sound. That lasted for about another two minutes, then it too disappeared behind the treeline, in the same general area as the first, perhaps near Balboa Park.;34.166344402985;-118.508209701493
