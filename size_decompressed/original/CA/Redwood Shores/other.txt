The circle looked as if it may have been the exhaust of a missile/rocket (very white as viewed from below).  There were vapours/gases streaming from 5 o'clock position.  Interesting contrail in the sky at end of sighting looked as if something was trying to make physical contact with object i.e air to air missile.  Contrail was convaluted all over a small area of sky.  Heard in the paper the next week that there was a minuteman missile succesfully shot down by anti-missile......was this what we all saw?  7 witnesses on deck at b-b-q all saw phenomenon (I thought for the first minute that we were actually seeing a fireball coming straight for us, thankfully not) Please contact and give verification that it was the missile test please.
