While driving East on highway 50 fireball dropped out of sky.;1994-09-20 20:00:00;1second;While driving East on highway 50 fireball dropped out of sky. I was driving,my wife was in the passenger seat,my friend john was seated in back seat.We were taking john home.We were aproching Sunrise ave. When this fire ball dropped out of the sky on the horizon.My wife and I both saw it as it was right in view.I think it was partly cloudy.We were both silent for about what seemed like a minute,then I asked if anybody else in the car had seen what I saw.John did not as his vision was cut off from the roof of the car. I was really relieved when my wife asked me what was that.It looked like the sun,it was hard to tell how large it was ,it was large enough to get our attention.My wife was a student,and I worked in maintenance at a local store.;38.6055829787234;-121.267976595745
