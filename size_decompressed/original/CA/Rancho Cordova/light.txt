Little army of star like lights pass over Sacramento County!Quite a scare.;2009-02-11 23:00:00;13-16 min.;Little army of star like lights pass over Sacramento County!  Quite a scare. We were looking in the sky like we seldom do and we noticed several lights some whitish blue and some light yellow.  At first we seen three moving acrossed the sky not in any formation or nothing.  Naturaly we keep our eyes in the sky and we noticed even more coming up from behind the others.  As odd as it sounds we have seen these objects befor but,only one to three at a time,  it was quite a scare to see them moving and scaterd across the sky above us.  Star like lights some brighter than others but all traveling in the same direction, like a little army of them. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from same source.

Slowly moving blinking star like obdject in the daylight 17:00 Hours PM;2010-08-20 17:15:00;10 minuites;Slowly moving blinking star like obdject in the daylight 17:00 Hours PM I was at my neighbors house in the back yard with my wife and two kids. We saw a slowly blinking, stationary light like a star. the first couple of minutes it apperd to get brighter and dimmer.  It was not moving for the first minutes of two.  Then it verry slowly got farther away and faded away.  I could tell its speen and position because I was sitting in a chair and I positioned my head and used the power lines to gauge it speed and movement. Thanks for your intrest-John;38.6055829787234;-121.267976595745
