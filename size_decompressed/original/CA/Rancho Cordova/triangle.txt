I am a 56 year old woman of sound mind.  I have been married to my second husband for 8 years.  He was in the other room at the time.  The exact time is not clear, but I believe it was between 6-7 pm.  I saw the UFO from my bedroom window in the northern sky. At first, I noticed a flashing light, which at first glance, I thought to be an airplane as we live right next to Mather AFB.  Then I noticed the triangle shaped object.  It was pointed like an arrow with a space between the two sides.  The color is what really caught my attention  it was a bright florescent green color.  I knew this was no ordinary plane. Suddenly, the flashing light stopped and it shot into space leaving a bright green trail behind.  It was so fast, it could not have been an airplane.  It was blinking, then sped away.  Amazing.;38.6055829787234;-121.267976595745
