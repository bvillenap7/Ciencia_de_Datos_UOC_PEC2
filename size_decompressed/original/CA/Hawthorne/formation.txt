RED light seen at night gliding together and lights disappearing one by one along with sound.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-08 18:47:00;1-3 minutes;RED light seen at night gliding together and lights disappearing one by one along with sound. On December 8th, 2017 Friday night.  I was sitting in my car facing west as I noticed red lights traveling together in a cluster of 5-6 lights gliding together.  I looked around and saw airplanes traveling towards airport which is the opposite direction.  The lights traveled low enough for me to hear a craft sound flying above and as each light disappears one by one until all gone I could hear the sound shut off until all you heard was the sound of people and cars.   A min later I could see helicopters or small planes flying around way different that the huge cluster of lights spread apart.  I immediately text two of my friends to log the time I saw the red lights and I also drew what I saw on a blue piece of paper with red lights.  After hearing other witnesses come forward I knew I had to account for my Experience.;33.9167999999998;-118.343200000002
