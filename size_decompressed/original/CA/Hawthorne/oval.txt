It was getting dark, but still somewhat light out.  My daughter saw it first, just to the left (south of the planet venus.  She said &quotis that a blimp?&quot I said &quotwhere?&quot and looked up to see a totally dark almost round but slightly oval object traveling in what appeared to be a northwest to southeasterly direction.  It appeared small, but the outline was very easily seen against the twilight sky.  My estimation, although I don't know the altitude, was that it seemed to be fairly low (below 5000 feet) and moving at a fast clip, in a straight line, making no unusual movements that would rule out an aircraft.  However it could be easily seen that there were NO wings, and I saw absolutely no running lights and no sound was heard.  My daughter, who was able to see it longer than I, said that she saw a small white light appear on the bottom right side of the object for about one second. I didn't see this. I lost sight of the object as it passed over and was no longer visible by means of the twilight behind it.;33.9167999999998;-118.343200000002
