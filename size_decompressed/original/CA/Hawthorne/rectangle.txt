A strange formation of lights flew low over an LA suburb.;2016-07-04 21:12:00;30 seconds;A strange formation of lights flew low over an LA suburb. I was sitting on the lawn of my grandmothers house shortly after nine pm on the Fourth of July.  We observed several Chinese lanterns to the north and there were intermittent fireworks going off around us.   A short while later I observed what at first glance appeared to be an airplane.  It was flying quite low, less then five hundred feet and yet made no sound. It was moving slowly.  I first noticed its front lint which was white and solid but emitted no beam.  The other lights on the wings were flashing but they were also bright white and emitted no beam.  They were flashing at a much faster rate than any wing lights I have ever seen and they were to bright as well.  Then instead of a rotating red beacon on the bottom it had a flashing white light.   There was no body to the craft that I could see. I pointed it out to my godfather who is an engineering technician at Raytheon.  He said he had never seen anything like it.  He pointed it out to my grandfather, a retired naval aviation mechanic, who caught a fleeting glimpse as it flew away to the southeast and he was about as baffled as we were.  The craft came from northwest to southeast and was visible for only about thirty seconds.;33.9167999999998;-118.343200000002
Weird light brown object flew low and slow across the sky;2019-11-09 01:21:00;45 seconds;Weird light brown object flew low and slow across the sky It was 1 object about 100 feet high & it flew horizontal from north to south. Appeared light brown in color. From my angle it was possibly the size and shape of a cheap refrigerator. If i could estimate ground speed, it covered only 2 miles per minute. We are just two average joes who happened to be observing the sky & arguing about which is the north star.  We dont use & have no history of mental health issues or of telling crazy stories.  I am not scared easily but the unusual shape, speed & flight path set off many alarms in my head. For some reason, this object struck fear in me.  Either it or the situation made absolutely terrified;33.9167999999998;-118.343200000002
