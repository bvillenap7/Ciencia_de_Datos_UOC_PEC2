It did not move (hovered)obout 200 feet in the sky over the erea of the old northrop bldg in hawthorne Ca. did not here eany sound.This was seen by two other people, and we are not shure what it was.

Bright Yellow-orange boomerang,with higher up white round object moving with it.Seen for 10 minutes,moving south-west.;2005-11-20 12:21:00;10 minutes;Bright Yellow-orange boomerang,with higher up white round object moving with it.Seen for 10 minutes,moving south-west. Sunday afternoon 12:21Pm.saw what looked like to be a good sized yellow-orange boomerang shap object straight north from my large front window. As it moved slowly south-west,another white small round object,much higher up seemed to follow the lower bright boomerang object. The boomerang object seemed to have flared wing tips,as it tumbled slowly over itself. Lost sight of both objects,when trees blocked their movements now going west,toward El Segundo,Ca.;33.9167999999998;-118.343200000002
light formations, objects that go from slow moving to fireball like. strange lights moving in circular motion;2009-08-05 10:00:00;4 hrs;light formations, objects that go from slow moving to fireball like. strange lights moving in circular motion more than a dozen easely thru out the west side of the moon scattered thru the sky some in formation and some stading alone. A few moving back and fourth at times looking as if turning into a fireball, real bright, then back into a slow moving object almost to look like a straight line with a shadow black top. at times displaying a red and blue light. others in the sky in wierd line formations as many as four in a row, slow moving all togeather with distance beween them, moving in circular motion then up and down. what seemed to be a red ball of light moving from the west to the east at a fast rate. to the north there was a formation of lights the brightest one alil. ahead of the other 5 lights. 4 of the lights were flashing red while 1 was flashing blue, then like at the 2nd light, what seemed to all of us to be a spirt of red dots that would spirt above the 2nd light then disapear then spirt again, over and over, all the while this strange formation of lig! hts were at a stand still. the strangest thing is that there is one real bright circalur object to the east of the moon. that moves up and down, in a circular pattern. we noticed that as time is passing its moving more in line with the moon. The moon also seems extrodonaryly bright, like blinding bright, with an orange glow around it, which seems to come and go. Iam really freaken out !!!!;33.9167999999998;-118.343200000002
