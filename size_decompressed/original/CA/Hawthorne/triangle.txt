While waiting for the coming meteor shower, my husband and I were warmly wrapped in blankets, sitting on lawn chairs in our back yard looking to the North.   As the showers began, we were enjoying the show when I noticed a very bright light gliding slowly across the sky going North to South off in the distance.  At the time it looked like just a white light.  At the time we lived near LAX and at first I thought it was an airplane. But then I realized there were no red or green runnung lights.   My husband continued watching the showers and was unaware of what I was seeing.  For no reason, I said, If you're not an airplane, come this way, come this way.  No sooner than I spoke the words, the object slowly veered west in our direction.   I got an eerie feeling and I pointed the object out to my husband. It moved very slowly and when it reached a point of about one half mile from us we still couldn't make out a shape since the light in front was so bright.   We stood there transfixed by what we were looking at.  It was only about 50-75 feet above us as it moved directly above our heads.  We looked straight up above our heads and it seemed so low I felt I could reach up and touch it.   It was a triangular shape,  dull black and there was no sound. It was gigantic.  At each point of the triangle was a dull white light with a very bright white light in the center.  It glided over us and slowly headed west towards the ocean.  There wasn't any noise or sound of any kind.  After approximately one half mile or so, the craft veered back to the south as we watched it fly out of our line of sight.  At this point, my husband, who was no longer watching the meteor shower looked at me and said, well it's time to go inside.  And that was the end of that. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1985 may be approximate.  Two major meteor showers occur during August and November of each year.  PD));33.9167999999998;-118.343200000002

Trailing edge did not have lights. It was dark but there were a lot of city lights you could see the outline clearly with good eye sight. It was traveling extermly fast as if it was a shootong star coming to crash on earth then it suddenly diaaperaed but not in a way as if the lights went out but as if it went into a portal right into the clear night sky. Oh, it was a very clear clod night. It was close to LAX so right at first we thought it was a plane of Helo crashing because of the seed coming down but then it slid into nothing??;33.9167999999998;-118.343200000002
