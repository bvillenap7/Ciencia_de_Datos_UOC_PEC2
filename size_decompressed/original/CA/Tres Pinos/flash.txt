Bright sustained slower moving streak across the northwestern sky in Central California Monterey Bay Area;2003-09-29 20:00:00;5-7 seconds;Bright sustained slower moving streak across the northwestern sky in Central California Monterey Bay Area This was a very bright slow moving streak moving southward across the sky...much longer in duration and slower moving than a shooting star...it flashed brightly just before it dissapeared. It seemed to have an orange yellow tail with a bright white center. Both my wife and I saw it through the widow of our car.  We had just been prompting our children to look at the moon as it was very clear in the sky tonight and the area we were in was very dark...the stars and moon were very visible. The streak started just in front of us and tailed downward. We both commented on how strange it was to see a streak last so long and move so slowly....either a very large meteor and very high?  we immediately commented on the incident in India;36.7685;-121.2973
