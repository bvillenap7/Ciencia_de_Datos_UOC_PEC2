It was moving  southbound, over US-395 near the intersection with Whitney Portal Rd.  My friend and I were out of our car on Whitney Portal Rd, looking at stars, when my friend spotted the object to the east (toward US-395 (Main St)).  The object was silent, not moving very quickly and appeared to be about 150-200 feet above the ground, and approximately 50-60 ft in length, 20-30 ft deep and about 10-15 ft thick (all estimates).  When first spotted, the object appeared to become semi-transluscent and then solid, and throughout the observation, appeared very very dim.  It slowly glided behind some trees, and when we went to the other side of the trees, it was no longer there.  We went back the next night (same time and location) but did not see anything.;36.5787;-118.0624
