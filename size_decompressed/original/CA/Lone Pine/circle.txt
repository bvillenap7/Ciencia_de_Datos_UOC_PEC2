15 quick moving white orbs in perfect/tight formation over Sierra Nevadas.;2007-07-07 11:20:00;10-15;15 quick moving white orbs in perfect/tight formation over Sierra Nevadas. Woke up at 11:00 to check out of hotel and go get hiking permits. I went outside of the Lone Pine Hotel to pack backpacks. despite the fires going on to the right, near big pine, and the huge advaning smoke plume, it was crystal clear and bright. I was looking up at Mt.Whitney and decided to put on my glasses(amber lens)because it was so bright. I  immediately saw a group of 15 or more white colored round objects moving quickly above the Whitney range. At first I thought them to be birds but I noticed they all moved together, in perfect formation, up and down. They disappeared when they turned either towards or away from me. I couldn't tell how large they were or how fast they were moving. I guess they were pretty far away and high, They appeared to be moving quickly to the north, right into the smoke (they may have been higher than the smoke but not likely). I didn't think birds fly into smoke! Anyway, they were remarkably similar to those ufos spotted down in mexico. My girlfriend saw them as well.
