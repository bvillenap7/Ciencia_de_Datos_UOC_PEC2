We went to take photos of the four meteor showers. Around 1:08am. I noticed what at first I thought was a meteor acting oddly. It made a left hand turn in the sky. I told my son to look up and he saw it too before it disappeared. When we came back home I started looking at our photos and I found two photos where this mysterious object was in. The shutter was set to 8 seconds of capture with a 3 second gap between shots.  I called my son in to look at them and he believes that we caught a small spacecraft leaving a plasma trail behind it. He noted that the craft itself acted similar to aircraft in how the trail went bright, then faded as the object moved. Then we got curious and started calculating where the craft started to where it ended. We made a rough guess that the craft was at an excess speed of 4500 mph...going about Mach 5.85. The area is Lone Pine and the camera is facing towards the North East.;36.5787;-118.0624
