For approximately ten minutes off the coast of the Pacific, a strange bright orb was hovering in the night sky.  At first I thought it was a star, then it started to bounce/hover closer to the coast.  My next guess was that it was some sort of satellite?  But what type of large, bright, satellite would be that close to LAX?  It would be a danger to the planes coming and going.  I am not sure what it was, all I know is what I saw.  What I saw was not a star, not a plane/chopper, not a satellite, nor was it a flare, as I have seen flares in the past. After about ten minutes of observation, and the orb backtracking away from the coast, it disappeared.  I remain confused and astounded.;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
Three bright orange orbs floated silently through the sky, before disappearing one by one.  ((anonymous report));2017-05-24 00:30:00;160 seconds;Three bright orange orbs floated silently through the sky, before disappearing one by one. Two bright orange lights that looked like orbs appeared over King Harbor.  They made no sound.  There was no wind.   They moved up into the clouds, north by northeast at a fairly fast rate.  When the two orbs disappeared and third light was seen. it appeared to be bigger and brighter and was moving towards my home.   It stopped for a few seconds, hovering silently like the other two before proceeding to move up into the sky before finally disappearing into the clouds.;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
