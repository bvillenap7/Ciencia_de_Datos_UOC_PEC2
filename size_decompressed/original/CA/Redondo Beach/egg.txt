Light not resembling star or aircraft hovers high above South Bay, California.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus or Jupiter??  PD));2007-05-02 23:30:00;~1 hour;Light not resembling star or aircraft hovers high above South Bay, California At approximately 11:30pm the following events occurred.   After walking my dog on the beach, I stopped for a stretch.  It was an extremely quiet night and we had seen maybe one other person walking the beach. An extremely odd girl shows up out of the blue and asks me if I saw the UFO. I said no and she proceeded to show me an object in the sky. Most would think a star, but this had no sparkle whatsoever and absolutely no flashing lights. Using my finger for a reference I could see the object was indeed in motion heading west at a decent speed. She told me to listen to 640 am, and I made my way home. I went back outside to look again when I saw this object with the same light consistency, but a much slower pace.  It seemed to be in constant motion vertically, but slightly changed back and forth left to right. This is a series of blown up shots over 5 minutes, with the actual size on the left.
