Bright ringed object seen tumbling soundlessly over Redondo Beach CA.;2009-02-22 19:00:00;10 minutes;Bright ringed object seen tumbling soundlessly over Redondo Beach CA. At about 7:00 PM local time I was travelling north on Esplanade avenue at Torrance blvd in Redondo Beach. I looked up to see a ringed object seemingly tumbling or darting in and out of cloud cover. I stopped at the corner of Esplanade and Topaz Street to look up and see the vehicle perform maneuvers for about 10 minutes. It appeared to be a solid object, with a ring of blue white light around the outside. Occasionally some small strobes were visible as it tumbled and moved back and forth laterally. It appeared to be somewhere over Esplanade and Pacific Coast Highway. There was no sound whatsoever and the object rotated and tumbled about for several minutes. It was observed by dozens of other witnesses. Eventually I left and the object was last seen descending toward the Hollywood Riviera area of Redondo Beach.

7 spherical orange lights/UFO's w/ rectangular aura sighted in night sky at Redondo Beach, Ca.  10-8-11 at  23:58;2011-10-08 23:58:00;7 mins.;7 spherical orange lights/UFO's w/ rectangular aura sighted in night sky at Redondo Beach, Ca.  10-8-11 at  23:58 At 23:58 on Saturday 10-8-11, I was smoking a cigar by the pool in my apartment complex when the security guard on duty came running by shouting to follow him quickly.  When we arrived at a clearing, we saw orange lights hovering in the sky, moving in very slow formation.  By the time I was able to get my cell phone to record the event, we counted 7 objects in the sky.  They seemed round and bright orange and seemed to dim out and disappear.  Duration was about 2 minutes. Two minutes later, at 00:00 10-9-11, we saw a single UFO moving toward us slowly. It was closer this time. The best description I can give is that it looked like a rectangular orange lantern floating in the sky even though we knew definitely that it wasn't a lantern. It was longer vertically and at the center was a brighter spherical light, perhaps the craft itself. The rectangular shape was more like a light surrounding the craft and not the craft itself. It soon dimmed out and with the naked eye we could still see, faintly, the spherical center moving across the sky. Almost like it turned the light off that gave it a rectangular aura. Then it disappeared. At 00:05 10-9-11, another single UFO appeared and seemed to float across the sky before dimming out again. Again orange and like a rectangular lantern with a brighter spherical core. There was never any sound. There was no wind, the night was relatively clear with low cloud in certain parts. When the singular craft moved toward us at 00:00, we could also make out a kind of reflection of white light behind it on the bottom of the cloud. Almost like if one would shine a headlight up toward the cloud. I have posted the videos I took from my Droid3 phone onto Youtube. The cell phone videos don't do justice to what we saw with our own eyes. But at least it was recorded! Here are the links for your review. I couldn't figure out a way to send it via email because the file sizes are too big. I work in sales/promotions at the Los Angeles Times and the security guard was an MP in the army during his tour in Iraq. Hope that helps!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVTwjusYz_U http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0uVY6TTxxM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go8uzP71bt0;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
My husband and I were inside the house and heard a weird noise that sounded like it was coming from the garden. Looking out of the wind;2013-02-15 22:00:00;10 minutes;My husband and I were inside the house and heard a weird noise that sounded like it was coming from the garden.  Looking out of the window we were immediately drawn to TWO red/orange circular lights in the sky...traveling what looked like north to south, appearing to be heading towards the ground.  They seemed to be traveling together, not to or from the airport, LAX which is super close! They seemed to have their own groove, not like the airplanes, a slight back and forth movement whilst traveling, looking like heading towards the ocean?  When we see the planes, they give a white light, not a red light!  There was a haze...maybe because the ocean and full sky as a background? We absolutely could NOT identify them as being aircraft that we are used to seeing.  Was a very strange sight in all.  NEVER seen anything like that before! We came inside and went straight onto the computer to see if there were any reports of them..we know there's meteor activity out there ! right now...but we came across your site instead so decided to submit a report.  I wish I had grabbed my iPad to record it, will be on the lookout and film again if we see again!;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
