a UFO spotted late at night in Los Angeles area on 1/12/08;2008-01-12 23:00:00;1-2 seconds;a UFO spotted late at night in Los Angeles area on 1/12/08 While stargazing - blocking ambient light with my arm and hand raised (blocking street light) Orion then very visible (Mars straight up above), this UFO just silently flew by.  Facing south it flew past at about 45 degrees up from the horizon from left to right across my gaze (from east to west). No sound what-so-ever (due to the apparent distance it resembled a firefly or some type of flying animal with a light emitting from it). But being out just under a mile it must have been large and very fast - faster than any jet or rocket.  It had but one light that I could describe--going by so quickly there was an apparent light trace (faded fast behind it) bright amber in color. A true UFO sighting by any standards - my first.;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
