My fianc√© and I saw at about 8:10PM in Redondo Beach heading Southeast, silently, and at a high rate of speed at low altitude, two circles side by side which were obviously part of the same structure, and were the bottom of a larger rectangular body.  It was faintly lit, and it was only visible for approximately 5 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
