However, on this particular night, while driving home from eating out late ( I’m a waitress and often leave work after midnight ),  my boyfriend once again points out this blinking light over the ocean.   After parking at home and standing on our balcony to get a better look, we see that it is three lights, varying in colors and changing often from red to blue to white.  The lights are at equal level and seem to be suspended in one place just hanging there.  It was clearly not a plane or helicopter, and this is obvious as planes and helicopters are continuously passing by it simultaneously.  There is no comparison between the normal planes to this craft of lights.  They were totally different.  After about twenty mi! nutes the three lights that were once at equal level seemed to turn into a diagonal line and then slowly fade in brightness and visibility.
