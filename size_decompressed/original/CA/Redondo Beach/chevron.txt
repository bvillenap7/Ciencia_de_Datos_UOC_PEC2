The time was around 6 pm and is approximate.  The sun had just set and the sky above was still a deep blue and clear. I looked up at the sky as I normally do to observe the stars, and just at that moment I saw what I thought was at first a meteorite was glowing red, left a faint trail, and was heading in a southeasterly direction. As the light fizzled out, I then was awestruck when the fizzled out light reappeared as a bright white light  much larger than any star, Iâ€™d say about three or four times the size of the planet Venus, and was clear and distinct.  For a split second I thought I saw a green light, which would have been the right side of a craft.  As the light turned full circle and coming toward me, it then banked and that is when it revealed three distinct and bright white lights in the form of a V, or chevron, with the two lights of the V facing forward, and the point light trailing (again each light about three or four time the size of Venus.)   No apparent sound was audible from where I was. The craft made a complete circle and seemed to dive.  It was traveling at a speed I would say was perhaps that of a fighter jet doing casual maneuvers, but was way to agile to be a passenger jet, in my opinion.  The object appeared to be over the ocean and I guestimate, about three thousand feet up.  In holding my hand out afterwards I would say the size of the shape of the three-light configuration was about as big as my pinky fingernail at arms length.  The last maneuver was a diving maneuver on the second circle the craft made and then that was it.  I was wearing glasses I use for driving which corrects my vision to 20-40.  The whole even lasted about one minute, when the object fell below my field of view behind some apartments.  I walked a ways down the street to a better vantage point to see if the object would reappear but it did not.;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
