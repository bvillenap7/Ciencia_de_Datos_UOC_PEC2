3 Lights along Los Angeles Coastline;2013-08-07 20:00:00;10 minutes;3 Lights along Los Angeles Coastline Hi, at approximately 8 pm my wife and I were looking west at the sunset over the ocean, standing on Redondo Beach, CA.  We noticed after the sun went down, three distance bright orange oblong shapes in the sky.  This was very distant, miles away, over the mountain coast past Malibu, looking northwest.  These blips slowly moved individually at approximately 45 degrees, as if they were moving away from us possibly and across the sky, but not in formation.  One moved towards the earth and two slowly up and away. We assumed because of the slightly orange sunset sky, that they were orange because of reflecting the sunset, so they could have been silver or reflective in some way.   Nearer to us, Planes were taking off from Lax, moving east to west across the sky lifting off, and they were consistently silhouetted against the orange sky, without their lights on. So to us, whatever was in the distance was very orange (reflective possibly).  As they began to become less visible, assuming distance, one object suddenly appeared as a very brilliant light for about 3 to 5 seconds and disappeared.;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
Possible UFO over Redondo Beach trench?;2013-10-08 08:00:00;3 minutes;Possible UFO over Redondo Beach trench? It was about 7 or 8 pm at night.  I went out on my balcony which is on the 3rd floor and is about 2 miles east of Redondo Beach.  I can see Palos Verdes Penninsula from my balcony.  I opened the sliding glass door and went out.   I saw what appeared to be a large blimp like object.  But, the object moved faster than a blimp and slower than a plane.  It was multi colored and continuously blinking red blue and white lights.   There were lots of black clouds coming in off the ocean.  So, before the object moved behind these clouds I quickly ran and got my camera.  I snapped four pics.  But the 2 here were the only ones that came out before it disappeared.   The 2 that came out I just blew it up so you can see the lights more clearly.  The first set of lights were 2 red lights.  The 2nd pic, I caught the red and blue as the blue light was blinking.   I reported this to MUFON who subsequently did a phone interview with me.  They said it was unidentifiable.  I'll let ! you be the judge.  This isn't the 1st time I saw a UFO around my area.;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
Unidentifying object over the ocean in Redondo Beach California. Caught on photo;2021-01-22 17:00:00;10second;Unidentifying object over the ocean in Redondo Beach California. Caught on photo Me and my husband were driving back taking the beach route home. We took Pacific coast all the way down to Redondo Beach. It was raining earlier so it was really kind of gloomy and cloudy but for one moment we saw the sunshine through and the water looked beautiful and I decided to take a picture. When I look back at my photos it's when I noticed the object. I could not see it with the naked eye looking out over the ocean. But in my photo I see it because I zoomed in on a certain part of the ocean where the sun was shiny down on and noticed too lights shining down onto the water. The one light was the ray of sunlight coming through the clouds. The other light was coming from the object that I saw.;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
