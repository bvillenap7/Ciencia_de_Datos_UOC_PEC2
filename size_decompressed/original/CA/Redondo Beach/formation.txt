Blue-green luninescent objects moving at a high rate of speed, producing no sound and maneuvering at incredible angles to each other.;1999-11-26 17:50:00;10 sec.;Blue-green luninescent objects moving at a high rate of speed, producing no sound and maneuvering at incredible angles to each other. My neighbor and I were playing a game outside ,after scoring he thrust his arms up and said, Yes!, what the heck is that?  He directed my attention towards four bluish green luminescent objects passing overhead and traveling from east to west.  They were moving at a high rate of speed, and were maneuvering relative to one another.  At one point they came close together, then moved apart to form a v shape.  Four people, two adults and two children witnessed the event.  Also, the objects made no sound as they passed over.  It was clear with no clouds.  I am 5 miles south of LAX and we have seen many planes fly over.  We had never seen anything that could move east to west, and dart back and forth, north to south before.  The objects disappeared into the horizon to the west over the Pacific ocean.;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625

Blue-green luninescent objects moving at a high rate of speed, producing no sound and maneuvering at incredible angles to each other. ---------------------------------------------------- I thought it might be worth while to give my take on the report. As stated, I had just scored (the winning shot I might add) and threw my head back, and hands up in victory, when I exclaimed What the heck is that? I saw 4  fairly dim lights if you will, bluish-green in color, tracking east to west at a pretty good clip. The speed, east to west was constant. Their speed relative to each other, varied. My first thought was they were those spotlights used for attracting attention to businesses around the area, except there were no clouds to reflect the light, nor were there any beams emanating from the ground. Lastly, spotlights travel in a set pattern, extending out from a focal point, then returning, these definitely came in from the east, and disappeared on the western horizon. Now, all the while, these four lights were not just moving east to west, but performed maneuvers similar to those of the previously mentioned spotlights. At one point, they all came together, sort of spun around each other, then separated back into a new formation. While almost directly overhead, two of them stayed stationary in the center, while the other two, (one on each side of the two stationary lights) made circles as they flew. A little hard to explain, but if you hold up two fingers on each hand, put the index fingers touching side by side, and start rotating the second fingers in opposite circles (one move clockwise, the other counterclockwise) you can get an idea of the formation as it passed overhead. Of course, the tips of your fingers will represent the lights themselves. Now remember, these varying formations are still moving at a constant speed east to west. They traveled somewhere between 3/4, and 1/2 of a persons field of view, meaning east horizon, to west horizon in just about 10-15 seconds. The speed seemed fast, yet they almost seemed to be moving in slow motion. They made no sound whatsoever, which was noted immediately, since they did not appear to be that high in the sky. I cannot guess at an altitu! de, because I don't know the actual size of the objects. If they were the size of a car, then I would guess somewhere between between 1000 to 1200 feet. (ONLY a guess)  The two children who also witnessed this are my kids, and while they were enthralled by what they were seeing, once the objects moved out of view, became very scared and clingy for a lack of a better word. They were obviously shocked by what they had seen. Like my friend said, we live close to the airport (actually 2, LAX, and the smaller Torrance airport), so we know what planes are, and the normal tell-tale signs. (shape, lights, engine noise, flight behaviors, etc.) We had to play it off in order to calm the kids down. Later that evening, after getting them calmed, in bed, and convinced the aliens were not landing tonight, I went back over to my neighbors to discuss what we had witnessed. We both agree that we don't know what we saw, but we don't want to label it, especially without any other evidence besides our own accounts. A very surreal experience.;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
Four Circular Objects in Formation Sighted Over the Pacific Ocean Off Redondo Beach, Calif.;2004-08-23 04:45:00;10 Minutes;Four Circular Objects in Formation Sighted Over the Pacific Ocean Off Redondo Beach, Calif. I live in a house on the beach in Redondo Beach, Calif. At approximately 4:45 a.m., PST, I woke and witnessed four circular objects hovering over the Pacific Ocean to the west of my location, most likely about 3-4 miles out to sea. I observed them for several minutes, expecting them to get closer if they were airplanes. I also looked for flashing lights, simliar to those on aircraft. I could see no movement, and no lights. The objects seemed to remain stationairy, and did not move closer to my location. They appeared in formation, one lighting up at a a time. When I first caught a glimpse of them, only three appeared. Then a fourth appeared to the far north. The objects switched places several times, then slowly, one by one, the lights began to fade out, starting with the light farthest north, ending with the light farthest south. Several times the light to the north faded, then reappeared. Given the speed of the movement in which the objects changed places, I suspect they are most likely aircraft of some kind, possibly helicopters. No noise could be heard, however, and the entire event lasted only 10 minutes or so.;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
About a dozen red flashing lights passing quietly in the night.;2007-11-09 22:00:00;2 Minutes;About a dozen red flashing lights passing quietly in the night. Noticed about one-dozen red lights in a scattered formation. The formation was about one hands worth of area if you helf your hand up to the sky.  The red lights were a vibrant red, changing from a intense white/red to a red glow to no light.  The lights were not in sync and seemed to be inconsistant in their flashes.  The lights were moving towards the pacific ocean at a moderate to high speed.  There was no noise what so ever even though the lights passed directly over my head.  The formation seemed to be very tight with no specific shape or leader.  I pointed the lights out to my friend who immidiatly saw the lights.  She was a little frightend sice I had no explanation of what it is (being a aviation enthusiest myself).;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
Three white crafts in formation- very fast- 12-20k feet - West > East Redondo Beach Approx. 9:45PM- no sound or lights;2008-10-21 21:45:00;5 seconds;Three white crafts in formation- very fast- 12-20k feet - West > East Redondo Beach Approx. 9:45PM- no sound or lights Saw three white objects round in shape with some contours on their sides. The objects were traveling 12-20 thousand feet from west to east. On the deck of my condo the objects were only visible for less that 5 seconds Long enough for me to point them out to my roommate. It was amazing to me that 3 objects moving so fast did not make one sound. There were so light or markings or flashes. the crafts were moving in formation but seemed to change ever so slightly in formation shape.

Several colored orbs emitting orbs moving/changing into different symmetrical shapes while in flight.;2013-02-23 19:43:00;4 minutes;Several colored orbs emitting orbs moving/changing into different symmetrical shapes while in flight 7:45-7:49 pm moving east from the west (from the ocean) in redondo beach/Torrance, 7-8 multi colored orb like objects (moving in formation) performing different symmetrical formations while all moving somewhat counter clockwise and at one point lining up directly inline like a perfect stick or pencil then moving to another symmetrical shape (a right angle square).   There was a lot of open space between each orb even though they moved together.  Each orb was surrounded by 2 spinning orbs moving counter clockwise around the main orb which at a certain point only one surrounding orb would be visible then both would be visible at a certain apex of spin.  This was freaky, I live right in the air traffic zone of LAX and I saw this thing clear as day and close to the ground at roughly 200-500 feet and it was massive.  It seemed to be trailing a plane that was flying at a much higher altitude, while other planes overhead and in the area (one roughly 10-15 miles behind it) diverted back towards LAX.  I personally saw 3 large passenger jets turn back withing 5 minutes of this sighting.   Between 7:50 pm and 8:11 pm there was zero air traffic in one of the busiest international airports, airspace.;33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
Saw V formation 5-7 red blinking lights, very high up, heading SE over Palos Verdes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is MUFON member.  PD));2018-10-17 21:55:00;2 minutes;Saw v formation 5 to 7 red blinking lights very high up heading south east over Palos Verdes. I went out to my second story deck to view the Moon and Mars, and saw 5 to seven red blinking lights high up, in a perfect v formation, going south east over Palos Verdes.  I could hear a jet noise very deep sounding and got a video of them on my i-phone...the jet noise is also heard on the video as a low roar...this occurred at 9:55 pm last night in clear skys.  ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a highly qualified, and reliable, witness.  Also, he is a member of MUFON, and we have urged him to submit the report to MUFON, as well.  PD));33.8590291666667;-118.3720625
