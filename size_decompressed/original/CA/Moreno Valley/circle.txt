Two orange circular lights fading in and out that were neither parallel or perpendicular.;2014-06-18 23:15:00;15-20 minutes;Two orange circular lighta fading in and out that were neither parallel or perpendicular. June 6, 2014 around 11:15 p.m.  	I witnessed two motionless circular orange lights in the sky.  Occasionally, one of the circular lights would disappear as if it was being dimmed out (as if someone was dimming a light in a house).  This event  lasted for what seemed 10-15 minutes.   I was walking into my kitchen to get a drink of water when I noticed two orange lights in the sky through my sliding glass door (leading into my backyard) that overlooks the city I live in. I was facing south while viewing these lights and what made them so interesting to me was they were not moving, completely stationary the entire time the event occurred.  Initially, there were two orange lights and after a couple minutes one would fade out (again, as if being dimmed out).   After about a minute, the light that originally faded out would reappear then the other light would fade out just like the first one did.   The process of one of lights fading out and the other light reappearing happened three times.  Each time the light wou! ld come back it would appear in the same spot that it was in before.  This did not happen simultaneously, when the light would come back the other would stay from anywhere to 5-10 seconds before it would fade away.   What also made this interesting to me was that it occurred near an air force base in my city.  My house is located in a bit of a higher elevation from the rest of the city which gives me a panoramic view of the entire city and is roughly 10 miles from the air force base.  These orange circular lights were not parallel or perpendicular to one another (making me believe they were two separate objects) and one was always sitting a little higher than the other.   When the event ended, there was just a single orange circular light in the sky and it faded out just like it had been doing the previous times.;33.9295574074076;-117.232576936027
