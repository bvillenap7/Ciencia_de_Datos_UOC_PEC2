Five orange &quotfireball&quot UFOs seen at 6:10pm Moreno Valley, Ca.;2014-01-04 05:50:00;2-3 minutes;Five orange &quotfireball&quot UFOs seen at 6:10pm Moreno Valley, Ca. Driving home 5:50pm (checked time on my video taken) and seen four orange colored UFOS in the sky, they were pretty low but one of them much lower than the others, they all went higher and higher and higher until they completely dissapeared.  Friend said they looked like fireballs, they did but if it was fire why were they flying up?  The fifth one was the last one, looked MUCH smaller than the others.  Stayed outside and within 10 minutes after the ufos were already gone over 20 airplanes flew over exactly where the ufos were!!  The airplanes weren't all at once usually it was two by two at a time.   Crazy insane!  I will email video.;33.9295574074076;-117.232576936027
