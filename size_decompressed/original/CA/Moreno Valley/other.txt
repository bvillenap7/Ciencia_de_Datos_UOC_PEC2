Black square box, longer in width than height, with a white light bubble on the bottom portion.;2009-09-28 17:15:00;20 seconds;Black square box, longer in width than height, with a white light bubble on the bottom portion. Driving 60 freeway (at about 50 miles/hr with after work home bound traffic. Relatively close to March Air Force Base. Black square box with white light protruding bubble on the bottom about the height you would see a hovering traffic helicopter about twice the size or larger than that of a helicopter. No helicopter blades (though there was a barely visible large circular almost fast ceiling fan like haze surrounding and extending far beyond the object as compared to a smaller circle on a helicopter), no wings. Appeared to be having difficulty, somewhat sputtering across the sky almost as thought it was a helicopter having mechanical difficulty about to seriously have an accident. Then it came to a complete and sudden stop and just hovered motionless. I drove towards it, where it was at a standstill almost directly above and could tell it wasn't a helicopter or plane or balloon.  I drove past it, exited at the next exit and tried to visually located again! but it was no longer visible.

I was looking out the front windshield and looked up and seen a long strip of light.;2017-08-01 02:00:00;10 seconds;We were on our way home from the Morongo Casino and headed east on cactus street, it was dark outside and no cars were out there.  I was looking out the front windshield and looked up and seen a long strip of light.  It looked something like a jet when they turn on the rockets, but it was going up and all of a sudden it started to dash down.  Then all of a sudden, it just disappeared in mid air.  I asked my dad did he see it, he said he was watching the road.;33.9295574074076;-117.232576936027
