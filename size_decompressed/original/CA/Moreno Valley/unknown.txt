unidentified hovering object in the morning sky above Riverside, CA.;2007-09-02 07:15:00;15 seconds;unidentified hovering object in the morning sky above Riverside, CA. It was a bit past 7am in the morning PST on a clear blue morning sky morning (no clouds).  I looked out of my bedroom balcony toward the mountains.  I looked up into the sky and saw what appeared to be a white (colored) object.  It's shape is difficult to discern, but it was a solid mass, a compact object, with no wings (like an airplane), no propellers, just a mass moving at a very, very slow speed giving an appearance that it was hovering.  What immediately struck me as odd about this object was the rate of speed by which it moved.  I have never seen an object move that slow in the air, like at a snails pace. I observed the object for about 15 seconds, then turned way.  When I looked back, I could not find the object in the sky, it simply disappeared from the morning blue sky.  The best I can describe it's flying altitude is that it was significantly higher than what a helicopter typically flies, and lower than a high altitude plane (the ones that leave a cloud like trail).  So, it's shape is difficult to identify.  All i can say is that it was unidentified, it was flying (hovering), and it was an object.

I thought it was a Jet from the air force base but it was to quiet too be.;2009-08-07 21:40:00;3 mins;I thought it was a Jet from the air force base but it was to quiet too be. My fiancé and I were driving at night when we turned East on the street called Krameria near the air force base in Moreno Valley. When I looked to the left I saw an object in the sky above the neighborhood to my right it had 1 white light and 3 red all of which flashed in a way I have never seen our jets do. At first I thought it was one of the jets from the base then I realized it was too quiet. So I paid more attention showed my fiancé by pointing at it I then realized it was so close but the light was so bright that I could not make out the objects form. People continued to drive by like I at first sight thinking it was a jet. It seemed to have hovered for a moment then swiftly moved to the side as if it were heading east then quickly changed route as if it were coming toward us then stopped suddenly and hovered again over the same neighborhood that I originally saw it over in the beginning. I freaked out because I didn’t think that our base has anything that fast and quiet with no sound. I stared and then it moved quickly backwards then shot away and disappeared. I could not tell if it went up or to the side. It happened so fast.  It was just Gone.;33.9295574074076;-117.232576936027
Driving from Amazon in San Bernardino, there was an object in the sky that wasn’t moving.;2017-11-25 06:39:00;10 minutes;Driving from Amazon in San Bernardino there was an object in the sky that wasn’t moving. It’s just hovering over what look like could be Moreno Valley.   My boyfriend thinks it could be a hot air balloon, but wouldn’t it be too cold this time of year that high?;33.9295574074076;-117.232576936027
