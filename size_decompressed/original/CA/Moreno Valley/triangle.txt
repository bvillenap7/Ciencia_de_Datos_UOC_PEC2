Triangular shaped craft sighted.;2001-12-15 22:57:00;10 sec;Triangular shaped craft sighted. Object was observed from my patio while I was looking at a star formation.  My initial impression was that of a hang-glider due to triangular shape and lack of sound emination. The object was approximately 300 feet in length and was at a height of 500-1,000 feet heading due south.  Best guess of speed was approx. 150-200 kts.  I observed 5 reddish-orange lights on the right/starboard side of the craft.  I was not able to see the lights after the craft had traveled a quarter-mile from me.  I am a retired Navy veteran with extensive air controll experience.  It was a very clear and bright night with CAVU conditions.  Had I not been looking upward, I would have probably not seen the object.  I live in a highly populated rsidential area.;33.9295574074076;-117.232576936027

ON PERRIS BLVD., WHEN I SEEN THIS STRANGE OBJECT HOVERING OVER THE HILLS. I QUICKLY TURNED TO MY DAUGHTER TO CONFIRM WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT. NETHER ONE OF US COULD IDENTIFY IT. IT WAS TO LOW TO BE A PLANE AND VERY QUIET FOR A HELICOPTER. IT WAS TRIANGULAR SHAPED WITH BRIGHT LIGHTS ON THE BOTTOM ALMOST IN AN OCTAGON SHAPE.  IT HOVERED, MOVED RIGHT TO LEFT, AND THEN RETURNED TO HOVERING OVER THE HILLS. I SAT IN MY CAR IN SHOCK NOT THINKING TO TRY AND FILM IT WITH MY CAMERA PHONE. THEN IT WAS GONE. I DID HAVE THIS STRANGE FEELING IT DID NOT CARE HOW LOW AND EXPOSED IT WAS. KIND OF FREAKY!;33.9295574074076;-117.232576936027
