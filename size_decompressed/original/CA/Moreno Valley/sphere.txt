Calif.) Mr. and Mrs. J.S. were travelling westbound on the 60 Fwy through Moreno Valley when Mrs. S. looked towards the mountains due NW of their location and saw what she described as a shiny new quarter up in the sky ahead of them.  She alerted her husband to the object and he dismissed it as an airplane.  As she watched it, it started to fade in and out.  She hollered to Mr. S. to pull over because she was convinced at that point that it was not an airplane because of its behavior and the fact that the object was perfectly round.  She saw the object disappear completely while over the mountains and searched for it in the sky through the car windows.  She then looked straight up and saw the object directly over their vehicle.  At that time Mr. S. Saw it also and they both described it as a round, very bright white light that hurt their eyes when they looked at it.  The object suddenly turned bright orange and again faded out.  They said it moved too fast to be any kind of an airplane, helicopter or anything they've ever seen before.  Mrs. S. said the sighting left her feeling very disturbed and she felt as if some sort of communication may have taken place between herself and the object while it was overhead.  She felt very afraid that they would be abducted and didn't feel or sleep well for a few days after the event.;33.9295574074076;-117.232576936027
