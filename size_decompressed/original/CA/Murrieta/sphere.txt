Large chrome sphere moving quickly in the sky.;2014-08-15 14:00:00;3 minutes;Large chrome sphere moving quickly in the sky. Sitting in front of my business with a co-worker we saw a large metallic sphere (like a pinball).  Size was the same as a 747 jet.  It made quick moves  (approximately  two thousand feet), both up and to the side.  Each move was made in a split second.  The craft would stop on a dime.  The starting height was about ten thousand feet.  It then took off across the sky towards the western coastline. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Disappearing white light over Temecula, CA.;2017-06-13 21:00:00;2 minutes;Disappearing white light over Temecula, CA. I was about to enter my home with my brother around 9:00 pm on June 13, 2017 after a couple hours playing Pok√©mon Go when I saw a bright white spherical object moving at about the speed you would expect an airplane to move almost directly above my location. It was a fairly clear night but the elevation of the object was unclear.  The object was brighter than the stars behind it and was moving north to south from my location in Murrieta, CA.   I decided to watch the object to see if it had the blinking lights that you would typically see on an aircraft such as an airplane or helicopter.  As I watched the object I never saw any of those blinking lights. Then the strange part happened.  The object gained speed over the Temecula valley and it also started to rapidly gain altitude.  The once bright spherical object that was over my head was now abruptly getting dimmer and further and further away and eventually completely disappeared over the constellation Scorpios.   This all happened in a time span of about 2 minutes.  I continued to watch the sky for several more minutes and I did not see any sign of the object again.
