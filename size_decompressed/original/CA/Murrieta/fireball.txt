Fireball splits into 3 balls and hovers  ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected parachute jumpers. PD));2011-01-06 21:35:00;5 minutes;Fireball splits into 3 balls and hovers LOCATION: Murrieta CA 92562 DATE: 01/06/11 TIME: Approximately 935pm PST FACING DIRECTION: NW  First observed at about a 45 degree angle in the NW sky from where I was standing what appeared to be something that looked like a fireball moving straight down. Initially I thought it was a shooting star BUT the size and slow speed did not support this. The coloration was yellow-orange and it had a fireball like tail as it moved. An additional note of an interesting observation: the object(s) looked blurred around its edges as it came down, which seemed very odd. I almost thought I was watching a plane that had exploded in air fall to earth.   When the fireball-like object reached about a 23 degree angle it began to split into three balls of yellow-orange light, still connected at the top with the fire-like tail.  Then, once completely separated, the fire-like tails diminished and the balls of light stopped moving downward â€“ just hovering at about a 20 degree angle or so, each ball moving around, separate from each other yet staying at the same level in the sky.  This is when I! knew it was not a flaming plane. The three balls of light remained visible and moving around for 3-4 minutes. The balls of light seemed to dim so my thought was that they were moving away, hence getting smaller/dimming. This whole process was only about 5 minutes in total. And literally in the blink of an eye the lights disappeared. I cannot explain what I just witnessed. I was alone taking my dogs outside to the backyard. There were no sounds associated with what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected parachute jumpers. PD));33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667

At approximately 9:40 Pm on 01/06/2011 for the second time tonight I had a U.F.O sighting in Murrieta, Ca..  My husband, son, mother and I were outside when we saw three falling balls of fire falling from the sky.  The balls of fire then turned into three bright white lights that looked to be in the form of a triangle.  The same triangle we saw earlier tonight.  The lights then stopped and stood still n the sky for several seconds then just went away. ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected parachute jumpers. PD));33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667
