Dim Luminous Large Triangle / Grouped Lights;2004-09-15 11:00:00;3:00 minutes;Dim Luminous Large Triangle / Grouped Lights Hi Art  I was just listening to your show and felt compelled to write you.  I have two different events to share with you.  First off, some background on myself.  I own my CNC machining business.  Have been a race engine builder for years.  Worked with GM for years.  Studied astronomy, physics and engineering.  Very down to earth person.  I don't look for phenomena, but have always had a major interest in the natural world.  I quest for knowledge in all my endeavors.  I not easily swayed, I seek facts and details.  I could go further, but that being said, here's my events.  September 04  I was driving home from my shop ~ 11:00 pm.  I turned right on Jefferson from Date Street heading north.  It was a warm night and I enjoy the solitude of the night sky.  I had the drivers window down and was glancing up to view the night sky and stars as I normally do.  A dim luminous object in the sky caught my eye at about 11:00 above and to my slightly forward left.  I had to look out the window and look almost straight up to see this object.  I drove almost two miles to Murrieta Hot Springs road while slowing and viewing this object.  While driving the object never moved from it's position in the sky.  The object was the size of my thumbnail at arms length.  To not alter it's position in the sky over two miles horizontal on the ground says something of the height and size of this object.  The object was exactly triangle in shape.  It's luminosity was about a 10 watt bulb viewed from across a large room with an old lampshade covering the light.  It was a dull brown/gold in color.  It had a distinuished dark band that outlined the perimeter and appeared to be darker than the moonless night sky.  However the most strange element of this sighting was what appeared to be the underside, the side I could see.  The surface seemed to be in turmoil.  I would describe it as what you would see on a TV set with a screen full of snow on a channel without programming.  I pulled over just before I got to Murrieta Hot Springs Road to grab my camera in my glove box.  I just got back from Lake Mead with my boys and had not yet turned in the disposable camera for developing.  I stopped my truck while still watching the object.  In the time it took me to reach over to my glove box for the camera and look back out to take a picture, the object was gone.  I was standing outside the truck with a complete view of the sky and saw no hint of the object anywhere.......  I had not noticed any sound.  The object appeared to be very close to me, but with the distance I traveled and the object maintaining it's position in the sky, it had to be very large and very high.  February 2006  I was again driving home late at night, ~12:00 a.m. from my shop.  My girlfriend was with me at this time.  We were heading north on I-15.  Just pass California Oaks off ramp, we both noticed a very bright light hovering just above the horizon about NW, 10:30 from our position.  It was very strange in that there was no traffic in our direction.  No lights ahead and one set of lights very far behind us.  Very unusual for the busy I-15.  We commented on the brightness of the lights.  Like they were pointed right at us.  They were brighter than any aircraft lights I've ever seen.  But there were 3 together but distinctly separate.  We thought it may be a helicopter.  It moved ever so slightly towards us, maintaining it's altitude.  We continued to comment on the strangeness.  As we approached Bundy Canyon, the object seemed to start to draw a bead on us.  Again there was oddly no other traffic in our direction, but a sporadic car passing on the opposite side heading south.  As we passed Bundy the object was now even with us and within a 1/4 mile to the direct West of us and falling slightly behind us, say to the 8:00 position.  It's altitude was maybe 200'.  It then turned and maintained running parallel to our direction exactly off at 9:00.  It maintained that distance for ~ 1/4 mile, then moved in to us.  It continued to fly directly over the truck.  I become very uneasy and speed up to around 100 mph, because I felt like it may hit us.  It flew directly above us for maybe a 1/2 mile and then started to veer off to the East and disengaged slowly.  I could not see it off the passenger side except for just a couple of glimpses.  My girlfriend continued to eye it.  She said it then shot off to the East at an extremely high rate of speed.  Faster than a jet she said.  Strange facts:  NO noise.  This object made absolutely NO noise, even flying about 100' above us.  Three aircraft type landing lights up front and two of the same type lights in the assumed Rear of the object.  NO traditional navigation lights or strobes.  And the most amazing aspect of all is that there was no visible body.  We could not make out any physical type of structure to the object.  NO wings, NO fuselage, NO body.  Just lights and void between the lights.  Even as the object came over head, we could not see any type of body.  The object did appear to be circular only becuase of the way the lights were positioned.  I would estimate the size to be maybe 20' to 30'.  I figured you may like to add these sightings to what ever compilation you may have.  Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Triangular shaped craft with 3 red lights and smaller blue lights.;2005-03-23 20:00:00;2 minutes;Triangular shaped craft with 3 red lights and smaller blue lights. At around 9:30pm I looked out my window. I stood there looking at the stars for a few seconds. That night had a few low cumulus clouds. As I looked at the clouds an odd craft silently came into view through a break in the cloads. After observing it for a little while I called my two friends into the room. As the object approached slowly It looked like two rows of three golden lights. I thought it was a disk at first, but when me and my friends ran into another room to get a view from below, we could see that it was triangular. From the bottom view it had three red lights, one on the tip of the craft, and two on the back. In the middle of the bottom of the craft it had a large blue speckled light. There was also small blue lights scattered all over the bottom of the craft. And like I said it made only a small humming noise and was low to the ground. It was traveling at about 20 mph. When it went over my house, me and my friends felt some sort of energy...I don't know what but there was a charge in the air. I had never seen any UFOs before and I wasn't even a believer but after seeing this craft, which was unlike anything that I had ever seen before, I have become curius. Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667

Triangled shaped craft in Murrieta, CA;2008-02-22 18:30:00;Five minutes;Triangled shaped craft in Murrieta, CA It was around six thirty pm when I saw the first UFO.   I was working outside my grocery store taking out the trash.  Suddenly I looked up and saw a triangle craft that was not really pointed tips, but rather round tips of the craft.  I noticed it for about a couple of minutes and it moved a bit to the north of the horizon, and it hovered over an area for a few more minutes and suddenly disappeared.  I also noticed no sounds and it was almost see through triangle craft, it also had one red light on the tail but it was like in the middle of the end of the craft, so it was not an air plane or a helicopter. It blended well into the dark sky.   I kept a close eye on it for a couple of minutes no one else seemed to notice it but me.  So I didnâ€™t have any witnesses.   I work at a grocery store here in Murrieta, CA. I wonder if this is a new military craft or is it an actual alien craft?;33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667

Object with 3 very bright lights that made no sound in a triangle shape  ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected parachute jumpers. PD));2011-01-06 19:30:00;3 to 4 minutes;I saw and object with three very bright lights that made no sound in a triangle shape just above local homes At 7:30PM on January 6 2011 I saw a U.F.O. in Murrieta, Ca. I was out on my porch, looked to the west and saw three very bright lights in a triangle shape. What I saw looked like the three lights were the headlights for one giant object. There was no sound and no flashing of the lights. They lights were very bright and at eye level with me. The lights looked to be the same height as the local hills off in the distance and the object was just sitting in the sky not moving, just above houses several streets away.  The object was way under the cloud level, I could not see a shape of the object just the lights. I kept my eyes on it for a few minutes when the lights/ object then turned facing the north. The object was about three hundred feet away and about three to four hundred feet from ground level. I ran into my house to get my video camera and it was gone when I came back out to look for it. I have always wondered if they were real, just never thought I would! actually see a U.F.O myself. ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected parachute jumpers. PD));33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667

I was driving down a road in murrieta heading toward lake elsinore and i was going to change the music on my ipod in my car and when i looked up i saw three huge yellow lights, hovering in a triangle formation. it looked as though it was about 1,500 feet above ground and was just moving at a constant speed at what looked about 80-90 mph. i pulled out my iphone and began to record this object while driving and could only get about 5 seconds of good footage before i pulled into a parking lot, to watch it disappear behind some trees. another man pulled up next to me and asked me if i saw the same thing.
