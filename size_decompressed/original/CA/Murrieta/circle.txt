ORANGE UFO.;2005-04-30 21:47:00;1 minute;ORANGE UFO. Went outside to bring the trashcan to the front yard. Looked up , saw what i thought was a reddish star. Didnt think much of it.  On the way back I searched for the same star. It was way off to the right from when i first saw it. Stopped and looked at it for about 30 seconds.  It MOVED SO FAST close to me. It was still high in the sky, but it was SO big. At first I thought it was a star, twinkling. The 'Twinkling effect' was really long rows of light coming from the object. I dropped everything and ran because it seemed to be studying me. I was scared. I went outside and it was gone.;33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667
A small, flaming- looking object that moved strangely.;2009-03-13 19:35:00;1 minute;A small, flaming- looking object that moved strangely. Circular flaming object.  Seemed like 60 ft. in the air, moving slowly then it took off quickly.  We continued to see it for about a 1/2 mile and the flame would get bright and then alternate to a dim flame.  Another bystander was watching it while standing outside of a storefront. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
