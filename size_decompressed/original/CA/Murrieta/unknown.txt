I saw a distant light while going somewhere.;2004-04-15 17:00:00;5 minutes at least;I saw a distant light while going somewhere. I was in the car with my dad going to an event, when ahead in the distance I saw a light over the Santa Rosa Plataeu. I pointed it out to my dad but he didn't think it was anything. I don't know the shape of the craft as it was to far away to tell. It was around sunset. I know it wasn't an airplane because it didn't seem to move. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Moon like object moving abnormally, unlike any aircraft, location not reasonable for it to be a spotlight;2006-05-21 22:30:00;3 hours;Moon like object moving abnormally, unlike any aircraft, location not reasonable for it to be a spotlight Looking to the west, just above Santa Rosa Plateau, noticed a moon like object. This object would move briefly, then seem motionless for a few minutes. The motion at some points began to zig-zag up-down / right-left / in angles as well... Too much movement for it to be described as a distant planet or an aircraft. This happened just prior to an incoming storm (low pressure system). Spotlights were ruled out due to the location of the object. Observers: 32 y/o M Naval Engineer, 38 y/o F, 14 y/o F.;33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667
