I pulled over my vehicle to get a better vantage point on what he was seeing. We could see what appeared like an enormous craft moving from west to east. I took out my phone and began taking pictures. After taking several pictures, the craft appeared to combine intro one large bright light initially and then the light multiplied into several separate bright lights totaling around 12 separate lights. The lights appeared to be descending from the craft towards the ground at a very rapid descent. Within seconds of their descent, the lights vanished along with the larger craft. I have photos of each step of this event captured to the best of my ability. I was shaken, and could not believe what I had just witnessed. During the entire event, there appeared be several helicopters circling the large craft. We could faintly make out the sound ! of the helicopters, which numbered at least 6-8. They remained in the area circling the same area even after the craft disappeared.;33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667
