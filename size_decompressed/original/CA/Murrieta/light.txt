group of red/orange objects over plateau followed car down road;1999-12-20 20:00:00;7 min;group of red/orange objects over plateau followed car down road my mother and i were driving home up clinton keith road. to the east we noticed a group of sevural red.. id call them orbs, or lights they were a red/orange color... in the sky just to the east of the road as we passed Avanida La Cresta. they seemed stationary because when we first noticed them.. they were at about 10 O-clock from the front of the car, but the were moving around each other.  then they all broke off and went different directions when they got to about the 9 O-clock position from the front of the car. one stayed in the air next to us.. and followed us as we drove down the road.. to the left of the car, at about 700 to 1000 feet at about a 75 degree angle to the drivers-side rear passenger seat, it continued to follow us from about the point where you pass the Santa Rosa Plateau vistitors center.. until about 2 miles after Clinton Kieth Road turns into Tenaja Road where it broke off and went north twards ortega. as i was watching the one as it followed the car.. it was Very steady in the sky and moved at a constand rate. unlike the car that was going up down and around corners. it was always in a steady postion in the sky... but moving.. not like a reflection on the windows of the car..  when we first noticed the group.. they seemed as if they were moving around each-other.. circling around a center point. but they were all seperate and completely individual..  possibly they were coming out of another unseen object.. it was a very dark night;33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667
Erraticly wandering star-like object travels from north to south at a consistent, slow pace;2002-07-04 21:20:00;3 minutes;Erraticly wandering star-like object travels from north to south at a consistent, slow pace At 9:20 pm my husband and I were standing on the roof of our house watching fireworks displays in the Temecula Valley in Southwest Riverside County, California.  I noticed he was looking up.  As I looked up he said, Do you see that light, or am I not seeing right? I looked in the direction he was peering and noticed a star-like light in the sky.  It had the luminosity of Mercury or Mars (certainly not as bright as Venus or Jupiter).  If it had been still it could have easily been mistaken for a star.  However, it was its type of motion that distinguished it from a star, a terrestrial aerial vehicle or a satellite.  It was heading from north to south and traveling quite erratically.  It wobbled on an irregular basis from left to right, sometimes speeding up and sometimes slowing down.  Sometimes the wobble was a long slow move to the right sometimes it was a quick, short burst.  Sometimes it went a short distance backwards, but mostly it moved forward.  If it had been someone driving a car I would have said they were drunk as a skunk, weaving all over the road.  It did not move in a straight line with a consistent speed as a satellite we heard no sound and there were no other lights (i.e. wing or landing lights) as an airplane.  Its average rate of speed, although erratic, was generally consistent and not very fast.  It traversed 40% of the sky in 3 minutes, and if one held his or her fist out at arm's length, it would have traversed the width of the fist in 10-12 seconds.  The object was too high up to ascertain any detail other than it was a point of moving light.  We watched the object for approximately three minutes until it could not longer be seen because of the haze of light pollution.;33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667
Pulsating light in Murrieta with jet contrail intercepting;2007-01-28 18:30:00;15 minutes;Pulsating light in Murrieta with jet contrail intercepting On 01-28-07 at approximately 1830 hrs., a family member noticed a pulsating light in the sky above my home in Murrieta, Ca. (Riverside County). The rest of the family including myself were summoned outside.  The weather was less then partly cloudy with an almost invisible layer of patchy mist or fog closer to the ground.    About 20 degrees south of the full moon, I noticed a pulsating white light.  About one pulse every ten seconds.  It appeared to be in a vertical rotation, which is why I initially thought it was the beacon from nearby French Valley Airport.   But that beacon rotates horizontally, and the light appeared to be coming from above the strand of clouds which rolled past.  From above the cloud cover downward.   The pulses were more intense from a direction above the clouds and to the south (Away from the moon.).   We watched this light for about 15 minutes, then it stopped.   I never saw what was making the pulses of light.  After going inside, we came back out about 5 minutes later to send the family off and now noticed one contrail in the moonlight (35,000 ft.??) going from the N/E to the S/E and intersecting the same spot we saw the prior pulses of light.   I had not seen th light again.;33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667
extremely rapiding blinking red light meets with other,  then both go back from original spotted location.;2008-09-05 23:10:00;10 mins;extremely rapiding blinking red light meets with other,  then both go back from original spotted location. went outside to see what the dogs were barking at. they were barking for a at least 30 mins. shortly after walking outside i saw a red light blinking rapidly. i would compare the blink rate to a eeg test. it was very rapid. it flew across the sky toward me at an angle from my left. i was standing out in front of my house. it then went out of sight. i ran to the back of my house and saw it flying toward another light which was blinking mildly fast. the light that was blinking mildly fast then headed back out in front of my house. then red light which was blinking extremely fast then followed the slower blinking light back to where it came from when i first saw it, and then out of sight. the objects were extremely high. no way for me to tell the altitude. i can say the distance the rapid blinking light covered was about 30-40 or so miles within 15-20 seconds. i judge that by it appearing to be over the mountains way off in the distance 30-40 miles away. there was no noise from the crafts. and i don't think the dogs were barking at the crafts. was just a coincidence i happened to see it while outside. over the past few years this area has had a lot of sky bombs i call them. loud noises that shake the very ground under your feet when they go off. very deep sounds, there is nothing as deep and loud that i have heard that i can compare it too. its what i think a nuke might sound like. or a planet colliding with another planet. the other thing we would get is a sky rolling i call it. rolling sounds across the sky that i would compare to a huge steel ball rolling on a table. but much deeper and fast. it gos from one side of the sky to the other repeatedly, making the trip in seconds.just the noise that is. i don't actually see anything. on a side note. this just happened mins before i sent this to be sure its clear and not distorted.;33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667
A light ball was seen shooting away from the local military base.;2014-06-10 00:50:00;~45 seconds;A light ball was seen shooting away from the local military base. This sighting occurred on June 10, 2014 at approximately 0:50 I was driving north on the 15 freeway, on a three mile stretch of road between California Oaks, and Clinton Keith.  It was seen shooting north across the sky. With a quick glance I first thought it was a shooting star until it came to a sudden and complete stop in the middle of the sky. After this occurred I gave the object another look, this is when I noticed the actual size of the orb, it was made of pure white light.  There was only one orb seen at a size much to large to be an aircraft, the light did not flicker or dim, it stayed exactly where it had stopped and did not bob up and down or move side to side at all. After staying in place for approximately 45 seconds, it shot off again this time at an unfathomable speed within a few tenths of a second it was out of visible range. One interesting thing is that after looking at maps and trying to see where the orb came from in such a hurry.  Almost exactly the direction it appeared from is where Camp Pendleton military base is located.;33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667
Gold lights over Riverside County.;2014-08-25 22:00:00;1+ hour;Gold lights over Riverside County. In the distance of Temecula/Murrieta, just above the mountains there was a small cluster of four extremely bright lights.  They seemed to be fairly still but moving toward eachother.  3 disappears and reappeared rather often, and when they finally went out they sizzled out like a flame.  Slowly and dramatically.;33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667
Two white flashes with a green line from a moving white object. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 19:00:00;10 minutes;Two white flashes with a green line from a moving white object. Observed a growing white light in the sky while looking north. It caught my eye as the light appeared to grow from a slow moving light. The growth of the light spread in perfect circular shape while the circumference grew as time elapsed. Then there was a second flash of light which then grew within the first originating circle. The craft appeared to be moving slow leaving a blue/green trail in a horizontal linear shape. Then as the original white flashes continued to grow the craft then moved quickly north/up leaving the area of the dissipating light. However, the blue/green light took much longer to fully dissipate. I've seen many planes fly but have never witness such a visual as this before. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason, witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667
For the course of 30 minutes we witnessed what we thought was just a satellite moving across the night sky  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 20:00:00;20 minutes;For the course of 30 minutes we witnessed what we thought was just a satellite moving across the night sky, but then shortly after (10 to 30 seconds) there was another from the same direction forming a line. There were at least thirty in a row moving west from Lake Elsinore area toward Riverside/Moreno Valley... these were small lights, moving very fast. It was very odd especially since planes are not flying at the moment. There was no sound either. After 30 minutes there was no more activity and the sky was quiet.;33.5637317204301;-117.243066666667
