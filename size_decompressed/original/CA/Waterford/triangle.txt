Me and my Mom were relaxing in the hottub Looking up at the sky hoping to see a shooting star. There were alot of Tall trees to the left of us, and from over the trees we saw one bright light, at first my mom thought it was a satelite until two more bright lights followed behind it making a triangle shape. Me and my mom could clearly see the shape of a triangle in the sky, the triangle was darker than the sky and you could see the sky behind it. The triangle had three bright lights on each corner of it. The Triangle slowly cruised over the night sky without a sound, then the triangle stopped and proceeded to hover up into the sky until it was out of view. From the time me and my mom saw the triangle until it was out of view was about 2 minutes. It was an experience I will never forget.;37.6452;-120.7336
