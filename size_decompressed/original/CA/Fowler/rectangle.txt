Hovered solid black square/rectangle shaped object had no sound and no lights.;2013-10-04 13:00:00;10 minutes;Hovered solid black square/rectangle shaped object had no sound and no lights. I was taking daytime photos over my house and this object  was there when I looked.  It was jet black square or rectangle in shape.  It had no lights and no sound.  I then looked at my photos that i had just taken and looked back up in the sky and it was gone.  This only took about a minute or so.  I couldn't believe what I just saw and actually captured it on camera.  The time was around 1:00 or sometime after.   The weather was very warm and the sky was super clear and blue.  I did not hear or see any visible airplanes at this time.  I started taking a lot of pictures with my Nikon Digital D50 Camera now after I had captured some daytime objects.  I have captured that do not look like normal aircraft.  I usually see a lot of strange objects at night and hours of footage on video.  I was the only witness and I am unemployed.  Lately, I have a captured mostly bright and dull white objects that are shaped either: oval, orb, triangle or heart shaped. October 4, 2013. Thank you.;36.6335;-119.6757
