A very bright multi colored light hovering for an hour in Fowler, Ca.;2013-06-12 21:00:00;1 hour;A very bright multi colored light hovering for an hour in Fowler, Ca. On June 12, 2013 in Fowler,Ca. I was living in a house surrounded vineyards so I had open sky and could see for miles. On this night around 9PM as I was sitting on my Pickup Truck I saw in the distance this huge slow rotating stationary flashing multi colored light. It was very bright. Then I saw 4 planes and Helicopters coming towards this object just circling it for an hour. In the distance I could see this tall telephone pole where I can gage to see when this objects moves I can tell if it had past the pole or not. So I was watching all of this on a very clear night There were all together 4 planes but cannot remember how many were Helicopter's. After 9PM I saw the planes and one Helicopter corner it and hovering over this object as another plane or helicopter was on the left side trying to observe it. The object them moves to the right my left slowly.  Then at 9:55PM I went inside my house yet, I can still see what going on with my windows looking towards the North. At 10:00Pm I saw the planes and Helicopters still flying around but the Object disappeared. Then I stopped watching. This wa! s one night I will never forget. I couldn't believe what I was witnessing. This had to be about a few miles away. The object was flashing very bright different colors. To me, this object had the shape of a soda can but with rounded edges. I was looking straight ahead so this object was pretty low in he sky. I included a hand drawing. Thank You.;36.6335;-119.6757
