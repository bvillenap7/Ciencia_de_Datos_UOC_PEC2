I was walking back home from my jog when I looked up because I noticed an object that looked strange. I figured it was an airplane but I didn't hear a noise Ans I ignored it, at around 9:10 am.   I got on the phone with my brother and was looking outside at 9:24 am and noticed the same object out side in the sky but seemed smaller because it was moving away slowly.  I couldn't see it in much detail anymore so I decide to use my husbands camera with the long lens to view it, unfortunately the battery was dead but I was able to view it a little better. The object was very far away and with the camera I saw an upright cilindrical almost like an upright cigar floating in the sky.  It was grey I could see a reddish tint in the middle, as if it was hot or about to light up. It made no sound and was living slowly. It was visible to the naked eye for about 30 min, at least from when I first noticed it. It never landed only dissapeared in the sky as it moved farther away.;37.5411;-120.7735
