Suddenly it started moving, slowly then with increased speed.  It changed directions a few times then seemed to be accelerating towards earth, because the tiny faint star increased it's level of brightness probably 25 to 50 times in brightness.  It then turned and seemed to be gowing away and at an angle to what seemed like the east, then accelerated quickly and suddenly vanished within a short distance in the sky, like a shooting star, but simply could not have been, due to all of the directional changes and starting out so faint and slow.   A very similar event again happened to me in Washington State in the late winter of about 1999. The last time the star that just up and seemed to start moving was one that was due west next to the big dipper. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Rapidly moving, hazy lighted object, moving across sky from west to east.;1999-07-07 04:15:00;20 seconds;Rapidly moving, hazy lighted object, moving across sky from west to east. At approximately 0400 hours, I had just returned home from work and wanted to try out my new telescope to view the pre-dawn sky.  At approximately 0415 hours, as I was scanning between the moon and Venus in the eastern sky, a hazy, lighted object entered my field of view.  I continued to track the object from west to east for approximately 20 seconds.  I lost sight of the object while attempting to view it with the naked eye.  The object did not appear to ever get any closer to the horizon, as I would expect a satellite  to do as it circled the earth.;38.8094;-121.1716
