It swooped with amazing speed towards the horizon.  When it reached its destination it proceedeed to hover for a period of one to two minutes.  I took cover behind a large bush along side the road. It had three lights on the craft that spun counter-clockwise and another beacon light that was on top of the craft that remained stationary. Then there was a tremendous flash and the object shot across the sky in a south-easternly direction and had disappeared within seconds. behind the Quien Sabe Mountains. was out of sight within seconds;36.8444;-121.367
Very dim light, extreme altatude, traveling from Pacific easterly aprox. over San Jose or S.F., dramatic turn to south/east toward Araz;1997-10-16 19:05:00;40 seconds;Summary : Very dim light, extreme altatude, traveling from Pacific easterly aprox. over San Jose or S.F., dramatic turn to south/east toward Arazona or New Mexico, extreme speed, no heat trail, shape unknown due to altitude. Object was at such altatude that size and distance are difficult to estimate.  Object was spec of white light.  Came from Pacific Ocean to the west, traveling east at extreme speed!  Aprox. over central valley object stopped and then sped south/east in direction of southern California or Arazona. Duration was about 40 seconds. No sound, not aircraft, appeared high enough to be just outside of atnosphire, like a sattlelight except for the speed and dramatic direction change. PLEASE TELL ME IF ANYONE ELSE IN CALIF. SAW THIS, OR IF THERE WERE SIGHTINGS SOUTH OF HOLLISTER SHORTLY AFTER 1905????;36.8444;-121.367
Formations of lights hovering in the sky, then moving up in an angle.;2012-07-14 22:05:00;2 minutes;Formations of lights hovering in the sky, then moving up in an angle. I was a heading home from a late night jog a block away from home.  As  I crossed the street I looked to the left then to the right. I did a double take back to the left side because the sky was bright and it caught my attention.  I then sprinted home as I kept my eyes on the sky.  There were 6 or 7 bright orange lights, they were all moving together at a right angle.  One light did a question mark shape movement from the bottom up to line up in the formation of a back slash.  To the right of those, there was a formation of a triangle.  They all were moving  together at an angle and disappeared into some clouds. I waited for them to pass through the cloud and come out the other side, but they never did.  The cloud was thin and you see the lights get smaller in them.  After that I rang the doorbell to get my parents attention to see the lights, all the lights had disappeared, but my mother managed to see one new orange  light that was moving slower than the o! thers, but then soon disappeared into the same  cloud.

Six red lights in a row, traveling SE near Hollister.  ((anonymous report))((Report re-posted.));2016-08-27 20:14:00;1 hour;SIX RED LIGHTS IN A ROW TRAVELING SOUTH EAST NEAR HOLLISTER I WAS WATERING THE LAWN IN THE BACK YARD OF MY HOUSE IN HOLLISTER, CALIFORNIA.  IT WAS A NICE CLEAR NIGHT WITH A SLIGHT OFF-SHORE BREEZE OUT OF THE EAST.   AT ABOUT 8:45PM, LOOKING NORTH, I NOTICED A LOW FLYING RED LIGHT, TRAVELING FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST.  AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AS THE AVERAGE CESSNA AIRCRAFT AT 50 DEG. ABOVE THE HORIZON.   I RAN AND GOT MY PHONE TO CALL SOME PEOPLE BUT DECIDED TO TRY TO GET VIDEO OF IT WITH THE PHONE, KNOWING THAT IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PICK UP ANYTHING USABLE.   AFTER A FEW SECONDS ANOTHER RED LIGHT CAME INTO VEIW FOLLOWING THE FIRST FLYING AT A SLIGHTLY LOWER ALTITUDE AT A DISTANCE OF TWO FINGERS TOGETHER AT AN ARMS LENGTH BEHIND THE OTHER ONE.  BY THIS TIME I HAD GOT TO THE VERY TOP OF AN EIGHT FOOT LADDER THAT WAS ALREADY SET UP IN THE YARD SO I COULD GET UP ON THE ROOF AND WATCH THESE THINGS AS LONG AND FAR AS POSSABLE.  A THIRD OBJECT CAME INTO VEIW SAME ALTITUDE AND DISTANCE AS THE PREVIOUS AND THEN ANOTHER MAKING FOUR! RED LIGHTS FLYING IN A LINE ONE BEHIND THE OTHER.  HERE I WAS ON THE ROOF OF MY HOUSE DRESSED IN NOTHING BUT BOXERS AND ALL ALONE WATCHING THESE GUYS TRAVEL BY AND NOBODY AROUND TO YELL TO SOO THEY CAN SEE ALSO.  WITH THE LIGHTS ALMOST OUT OF VEIW ON THE EASTERN HORIZON I WAS GETTING READY TO GET OFF THE ROOF THEN ANOTHER TWO LIGHTS CAME INTO VEIW FLYING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE PREVIOUS BUT WHAT APPEARED TO BE CLOSER AND A LITTLE BRIGHTER.  THE FITH LIGHT WAS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE REST AND THE SIXTH SLIGHTLY LOWER BUT STILL HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS FOUR.  I AM A 37 YEAR OLD EXPERIENCED ASTRONOMER USING A LARGE TELESCOPE FOR MANY YEARS, I KNOW WHAT SATELLITES LOOK LIKE AND HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF KNOWLEDGE OF AIRCRAFT AND THEIR FLIGHT PATHS AND SUCH.   I AM SURE THAT WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT WERE NOT DRONES,CHINESE LANTERNS, WEATHER BALLOONS, SWAMP GAS OR ANY NORMAL AIRCRAFT DUE TO THE LACK OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND MARKERS REQUIRED ON ALL AIRCRAFT NOR WERE THERE ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT AROUND IN THE SKY.   AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO AFTER THE SIXTH LIGHT PAST BY, I DECIDED TO GET OFF THE ROOF AND JUMP IN MY CAR.  I TOOK NOTE OF THE TIME 9:05PM PACIFIC AND AS FAST AS I COULD I GRABBED SOME PANTS,NIGHT VISION,CAMERA AND SOME BINOCULARS WHICH WERE ALL TOGETHER ON THE DINING TABLE.  I HAD ALL OF THESE THINGS READY TO GO BECAUSE I HAVE OBSERVERD THESE RED LIGHTS SEVERAL TIMES IN THE WEEKS PRIOR WHICH WERE REPORTED TO THIS WEB SITE.  WHILE I WAS GETTING DRESSED A LOW FLYING HELICOPTER FLEW OVER MY HOUSE FROM THE SOUTH TOWARDS THE NORTH THAT HAD ONLY A FLASHING RED LIGHT ON THE BOTTOM OF IT BUT THIS WAS LIKELY THE NORMAL MEDIVAC HELICOPTER. I HAVE HAD AN IN MY FACE CLOSE ENCOUNTER IN 2001 OF A LOW FLYING TRIANGLE THAT I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH AND WISH NEVER HAPPEND AND SINCE THEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I SAW WITH COUNTLESS HOURS OF READING AND LISTENING TO ANYTHING THAT MAY BE LINKED TO THE SUBJECT IN A QUEST TO GET SOME SORT OF ANSWER TO WHAT I OBSERVED. LAST WEEK I CALLED AM1080 KSCO, A LOCAL AM RADIO STATION AND ASKED THEM TO ! ASK PEOPLE IN THE AREA IF THEY HAD SEEN ANY RED LIGHTS IN THE SKY. I HAVE ASKED POLICE OFFICERS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, AND ANYBODY WHO MAY HAVE SOME KIND OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD HELP ME FIGURE OUT WHAT IS FLYN AROUND ABOVE US. I TAKE THIS KIND OF STUFF SERIOUSLY AND WOULD SAY THAT I AM NOT OVERLY SERIOUS ABOUT IT BUT SOME MAY THINK OTHERWISE. ANYWAYS HERE I AM HAULN BUTT DOWN THE ROAD IN MY CAR WITH MY EQUIPTMENT IN HAND IN AN EFFORT TO CATCH UP WITH THESE LIGHTS AND REALIZE THAT I DONT HAVE A CHANCE IN HELL OF CATCHING UP WITH THESE THINGS AND DECIDE TO STOP AT THE NEIGHBORS HOUSE AROUND THE BLOCK. I PULL INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND BEFORE I EVEN TURN OFF THE CAR FOUR KIDS RANGING IN AGE FROM 4 TO 12 COME RUNNING UP TO ME ASKING IF I SAW THE RED LIGHTS IN THE SKY. I TOLD THE KIDS HOLD ON A MINUTE AND TOOK OFF BACK TO MY HOUSE TO GET MY DIGITAL RECORDER. I AM FAMILIAR WITH INTERVEIWING PEOPLE AND KNOW THAT QUESTIONING PEOPLE ESPECIALLY KIDS ALWAYS GOES BETTER IF THEY DONT KNOW T! HEY ARE BEING RECORDED, IT MAY NOT BE TOTALY LEAGAL BUT I FIGU! RE ITS T HE BEST WAY TO DOCUMENT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO TELL ME. TURNS OUT THEY HAD BEEN WATCHING A FEW RED LIGHTS IN THE WESTERN SKY SINCE ABOUT 8:00PM AND HAD CALLED ME TO TELL ME BUT I DID NOT HAVE MY PHONE ON ME BECAUSE I WAS OUTSIDE IN MY BOXERS WATERING MY LAWN. THE KIDS EVEN DRUG OUT A TELESCOPE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET TO WATCH THE LIGHTS AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WATCHED A RED LIGHT IN THE WEST STAY STATIONARY FOR OVER A HALF OF AN HOUR THEN WATCHED IT GAIN A LITTLE ALTITUDE AND THEN TAKE OFF AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THEY ALSO SAID THAT THE OBJECTS WOULD DISAPPEAR AND THEN REAPPEAR IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION I RECORDED THESES FOUR KIDS SEPERATLY AND GOT SOME EXELENT STUFF.   SO THERE YOU HAVE IT GUYS FOR THE THIRD WEEK IN A ROW RED LIGHTS IN THE NIGHT SKY.  DONT BE AFRAID TO TELL SOMEBODY BECAUSE ODDS ARE THEY HAVE WITNESSED SOMETHING ALSO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I AM ((name deleted))   IM AM LOCATED IN HOLLISTER, CALIFORNIA I SEE THAT YOU HAVE LABELED MY REPORT IN THE AUGUST REPORTS AS A HOAX OR POSSIBLE HOAX. IF YOU CAN COULD YOU PLEASE REMOVE THE HOAX TAG BECAUSE THIS IS NO HOAX AND I AM NOT SOME HOAXING LOSER. I THINK PEOPLE THAT LIE AND FILE B.S. REPORTS OR CALLS ARE PATHETIC SCUMBAGS.

It began to make a zig zag pattern in the sky and turned on a very high powered cone shaped light at this point I still suspected a helicopter searching the ground but the craft was too high to be usefull.  About 30 seconds later the light formed a circular ring shape that emitted from the craft.   I took video until it disappeared heading west towards the coast.;36.8444;-121.367
