Please see article.  PD)) ((BEGIN ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE ABOUT LAUNCH)) Air Force Test Missile Out West Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly, said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said. Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show. We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early, Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets. Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is, Gabel said. The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability. ((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS));36.8444;-121.367
RED LIGHT SOUTH OF HOLLISTER 10:23PM.;2016-07-24 22:24:00;1 hour;RED LIGHT SOUTH OF HOLLISTER 10:23PM AT AROUND 10:30PM, I WAS LEAVING MY FRIEND'S HOUSE IN HOLLISTER.  IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT, EXCEPT FOR SOME SMOKE WHICH CAME FROM A FIRE LOCATED 30+ MILES TO THE WEST, NEAR CARMEL.  THERE WAS NO MOON, YOU COULD SEE ALL THE STARS AND EVERYTHING.   AS I WAS GETTING INTO MY CAR, I SAW TWO PASSENGER JETS THAT STOOD OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE FLYING ON A PATH THAT WASN'T ORDINARY.  THE NORMAL AIR TRAFFIC TRAVELS FROM NORTH AND SOUTH TO THE BAY AREA, BUT THESE PLANES LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE FLYING LOW AND ONE TURNED AROUND, AND I THOUGHT MAYBE BECAUSE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A LANDING DELAY OR SOMETHING.   MY FRIEND STOPPED ME FROM GETTING INTO MY CAR BECAUSE HE NOTICED A RED LIGHT IN THE SKY.  THE PLANES DIDN'T SHOW UP ON HIS FLIGHT RADAR APP ON HIS PHONE, WHICH IS WEIRD.  IT WAS DIRECTLY SOUTH IT SHOWED ON MY FRIEND'S COMPASS.   THE LIGHT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ASCENDING SLOWLY.  WE WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 1 MINUTE.  MY FIREND WENT AND GRABBED HIS CAMERA AND BINOCULARS AND HOOKED UP A 65-MILLION CANDLE-POWER SPOTLIGHT, AND THEN THE RED LIGHT FADED OUT SLOWLY, JUST BEFORE MY FRIEND TURNED ON HIS SPOTLIGHT.   BELOW AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE BIG DIPPER, AT ARM'S LENGTH, IT WAS SMALLER THAN A PENCIL ERASER, AND IT WAS STOP LIGHT RED COLOR.  NO STANDARD FAA LIGHTS AND NOT THE USUAL NAVIGATION LIGHTS LIKE A USUAL JET DOES.;36.8444;-121.367
