Stationary object with lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting the star Sirius??  PD));2006-11-07 00:00:00;at least two hours;Stationary object with lights My son and his girlfriend watched for about two hours before awakening me shortly after midnight. The object looked like a bright planet. It did not move from its spot, but -- using binoculars -- it appeared to have large lights (blue, green, orange) that may or may not have been rotating around the outside. The object seemed to rotate on its axis because those lights would change from a horizontal plane to a vertical plane. Truly one of the most amazing sights in my 52 years! - ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting the star Sirius, we believe.  PD));36.8444;-121.367

They appeared to be smaller colored balls that changed colors, white, red, blue, green.   They appeared to be near the ground less than 3000 feet in the air and moved in random motions, and stopping for periods of time.     This is not the first time we have seen these lights, we have been seeing them for the past 6 months but not on a regular schedule.;36.8444;-121.367
