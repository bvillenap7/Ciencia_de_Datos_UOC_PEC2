2 lights following each other really high in the sky, and really fast.;1998-07-20 22:00:00;1 minute;2 lights following each other really high in the sky, and really fast. It was in summer of 1998, me and my friend we're in my house watching TV, and my Dad came in from the garage and told me and my friend to hurry outside and to look at something in the north-east sky. We then went outside to see what he was talking about and we saw a light flying in the sky from south-east to north-east, and then another follwing it. After watching this finally go out of site, my Dad then looked way into space to look at the stars and then noticed 2 more light flying REALLY high up and traveling VERY fast for being how high they were. They were following each other perfectly and were headed in the same direction the other object had gone to. The next day I heard that the spaceship challenger had been conecting with a russian sattelite. We heard that the same exact place in the sky we saw the first two were exaclty were the news had said it was seen that night. We then knew what the first lights were, but what really got us was the other two which were way out in the atmosphere, and it was impossible for the ship and the satelite to get that high and to go that fast. We also heard of the same report from other people. I still think about it and cant see an explanation other than it being two UFO's chasing it, and they were quickly catching up with it.;33.7197545454545;-117.186004545455
Enormous V-shaped formation consisting of inter-connecting puffy objects traveling very fast.;2008-12-10 17:36:00;10 seconds;Enormous V-shaped formation consisting of inter-connecting puffy objects traveling very fast. Sky was black with a few wispy clouds scattered about, moon low in the east, stars were out.  FROM NOWHERE, there appeared in the sky what looked like a gaggle of geese formed in a V, traveling west to east VERY fast, no engine sounds, no bird sounds.   Hard to describe - like individual puffs of smoke semi-connected to one another.   It's length took up 1/3 the span of the sky, it's width between the two points of the V was enormous.  If this were actually a gaggle of geese there would easily have been 75 to 100 of them.  As this formation flew across the sky it seemed to lose its length at the widest points of the V and then it DISAPPEARED.  I'd love to know if anyone else spotted this phenomenon.;33.7197545454545;-117.186004545455
