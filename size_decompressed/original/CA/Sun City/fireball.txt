It was about 2 years ago, I belive around June of 1997, I was on my computer and all of a sudden my brother and his friend ran in yelling they had seen UFO's above the hill. I was really excited right after they told me this becuase I had never seen anything remotly like a UFO, so I ran outside with them to witness it for myself if they had come around. I then asked them, while waiting for something else to happen, what exactly they had seen. My brother told me that they had seen a green light hovering over the hills to the west of my house, and that it had stayed there for quite a few minutes. After watching it they had seen it streek across the sky to the right in a perfect line and had actually left a trail for a few seconds. He also told me that his friend had been driving to my house right before this happened and he had said that his CD players and radia had mysteriously played the CD backwards! Backwards!! Then the radio made noise's and then turned off. After he told me this it was a few more minutes that I myself had seen the lights in the sky. I was looking somewhere else when my brother yelled to me that he saw it again and pointed to me where the direction it was at. I looked up and there was a bright green light in the sky. I watched it rise above the hill and stay there for a couple minutes, It then streaked across the sky VERY fast and left a line behind it for a few seconds. It went across the horrizon in seconds. I then saw it reappear again near the same area, a little bit higher this time. Then the same thing happened but it streaked towards the ground and then across the horrizon. We then waited for about five minutes more and it had acctually appeard above us and had a sound to it this time. It was really fast and the sound sorta sounded like a crackling sound and a wisk kinda sound. After that I didnt see anything else, but days after I had heard other people saw it and even said they had seen things in that area before.;33.7197545454545;-117.186004545455
Fireball and something falling from it viewed over Sun City California, June 16, 2008;2008-06-16 22:00:00;2 minutes;Fireball and something falling from it viewed over Sun City California, June 16, 2008 My stepfather and I (age 35) were standing in the driveway of his home in Sun City California. I was getting my luggage out of the car and he was smoking a cigarette when he called me by name and told me to look at that. I looked up towards the north and high up in the sky we observed what appeared to be a glowing orange-red-yellow ball. The hue changed between the three colors almost similar to a fire. As we watched the ball it remained stationary and something (?) appeared to fall straight down from it (also the same fire-like) color. It dissipated before it hit the ground. meanwhile the stationary fireball gradually faded over the course of about a minute until it was completely gone.;33.7197545454545;-117.186004545455
