Bright orange object hovering over incoming air traffic.;2012-11-12 19:59:00;1 minute;Bright orange object hovering over incoming air traffic. I was taking out some trash at night when I looked to the eastern sky (towards the Inland Empire) and observed an unusual orange ball of light hovering in a stationary position high above incoming air traffic headed towards LAX.   About 15 seconds after, this orange ball of light slowly begins to ascend to a greater altitude then stops to a still position for 20 seconds(like a bright star in the sky), then the object slowly comes back down to its original position (from when I first noticed it), all of a sudden this orange light gets brighter then dims down to a deep red color then turns black and disappears from the night sky.;34.0282633333334;-117.941535833333
Neon light across night sky.;2014-05-27 20:50:00;5+ minutes;Neon light across night sky Object was neon like ranging from red purple and blue.  Always a solid color before transitioning to another color.   No flashing lights near or on object.  Could not determine shape of object.  Very briefly the light multiplied into many lights.  The only way I can describe that brief moment is it was like there was a diamond in sky and the object flew right behind it.   Object traveled in sky very erratically.  Object reacted to helicopter flying by.  Object traveled very fast in a downward motion.   As soon as helicopter passed, the object turned blue again and continued flying erratically.;34.0282633333334;-117.941535833333
