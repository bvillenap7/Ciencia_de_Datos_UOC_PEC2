OVAL OBJECT WITH ELECTRIC BLUE LIGHTS FLY'S OVER LA PUENTE;2008-08-01 00:40:00;3-4 SECONDS;OVAL OBJECT WITH ELECTRIC BLUE LIGHTS FLY'S OVER LA PUENTE I WAS OUTSIDE HANGING UP A SHEET IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE, AND FROM THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SEEN AN OBJECT THAT WAS GLOWING AND AT THE TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS A SHOOTING STAR OR A COMET. I LOOKED UP AT THE OBJECT AND I SEEN AN OVAL OBJECT WITH CIRCLE AND SQUARE SHAPED WINDOWS THAT WERE DIMLY GLOWING. THE GLOW WAS AN ELECTRIC BLUE. IT WAS FLYING AT A FAST SPEED, TO FAST FOR A PLANE. IT MADE NO SOUND WHAT SO EVER. AS IT MOVED, I LOST SIGHT OF IT BECAUSE MY HOUSE WAS BLOCKING MY VIEW SO I WENT TO THE SIDE OF MY HOUSE ALMOST INSTANTLY TO MAYBE SEE THE OBJECT AGAIN BUT IT WAS NO LONGER THERE. IT JUST DISSAPEARED.;34.0282633333334;-117.941535833333
Bright White Pulsating Light/Orb over La Puente residence.;2016-06-11 23:00:00;30 seconds;Bright White Pulsating Light/Orb over La Puente residence. 4 of us were outside in the backyard having a cigarette, it was already late between 11pm and 12am.  My back to was to the sky, but not only did I see the flash of light illuminate everything around me, but I felt the pulse of the light.  It pulsed about 5 times before disappearing completely.  We are all frozen during the duration of the light, except for one of us who was actually right underneath it.  He saw the oval orb of light with a metal lining.  He described it being as big as a bus and right over head.  White light pulsing, and flashes the same as a camera flash.  Since he was exposed directly to it, he then felt a burning sensation throughout his spine the rest of the night, until the next morning.  During the course of the light, he was the only able to move, as he ran into the house screaming at us to go inside.  We all ignored him, and as soon as the lights disappeared, we all got up in unison and walked out to the yard.  The night was deafening silent!   About 5 min later, the music of the nearby parties picked up again, and everything was back to normal.;34.0282633333334;-117.941535833333
