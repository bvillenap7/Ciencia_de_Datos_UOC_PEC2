glowing red light seen over La Puente, CA.   ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  PD));2011-04-14 21:00:00;2 minutes;glowing red light seen over La Puente, CA At approximately 9:20 pm (Pacific Time), I walked outside of the building I work in to secure some items in my car.  When I finished I turned facing west and I noticed a large unusually bright red glowing light just across the street over some buildings.  At first I thought it was an airplane light since the air traffic around here is pretty steady.  I quickly realized this was no plane the light was extraordinarily bright, never flickered and seemed to be rapidly approaching me.  It was coming eastbound very quickly and it was very low.  I began to run towards it across the parking lot to try to make out what it was but the light was so bright that’s all I could see. When I first saw the object it was a ball of light but as it came closer I saw it in its profile and it appeared as a long continuous red glowing cigar shape.  It was only about a football field away from me to my left and it was flying over the train yard located across from valley blvd.  I then noticed a helicopter flying westbound (I believe it was an Industry Sheriff helicopter) and the object quickly shrank back into a ball shape.  It was as if the object was playing chicken with the helicopter, I almost thought they were going to collide or that the object would attack because it was so low. As the helicopter and object passed each other, the object flew over the helicopter and was probably less than 30 meters above it from my estimation, the object threw out a red almost force field like crescent moon shaped illumination towards its front end.  It completely lit the sky up around it and in doing so it revealed itself. It seemed like a ball of mercury, it was silverish and perfectly round.  The light shown for a few seconds and quickly faded into nothing although I could still see the circular object, as if it were driving with the lights out and there seemed to be very small electrical charges going off in front of it and I literally watched it fade into nothing. I bet anything that the pilots in that chopper saw it too there is no way they couldn’t have.  It was heading right for them and when it threw that red field out I know it illuminated the inside of their chopper.  So unreal I'm still in complete awe… ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 21:24 hrs. (Pacific).  PD));34.0282633333334;-117.941535833333
Hovering light seen over La Puente.;2013-04-07 20:45:00;~5-7 minutes;Hovering light seen over La Puente I had just returned home around 8:30 pm and once I got settled I went outside to feed my dogs.  As I was feeding them I noticed a very bright light that resembled a star sitting just west of my house.  I jokingly called out to my brother, “hey check it out the star of Bethlehem is over the house!”  When he came outside to see it we were discussing what it could be, possibly a planet or a large star when the object slowly started to move.  I quickly pulled out my phone and started recording for almost a full minute.  I have a good smart phone and I began to review the video I had just taken while the object continued at a snails pace in a northeast direction.  The video was completely black sky, which I found to be unusual considering how large and bright the object was.  The object then began to pick up speed and in my frustration I snapped a photo since my video was less than remarkable. We continued to watch it fly and as a helicopter approached from the east heading west (the object was very high compared to the position of the helicopter) the object quickly dimmed its light.  It could still be seen as a tiny speck of light which quickly disappeared in seconds. My brother and I were still talking about how strange it was when I remembered that I had taken a picture.  At first glance it looked like I had gotten nothing, but when I zoomed in and cropped the picture several times there is definitely something there.  It is the object we had observed only the picture captured the object differently than we had seen with our eyes.  We had seen it as a very large bright light and in the picture it kind of looks like a grey glow worm with eyes. There are always airplanes that fly over the house but this was not an airplane or helicopter or anything I’ve seen relative to our technological capabilities.  I’m not sure how long it had been stationary prior to me going outside and spotting it but it definitely was something remarkable that my brother and I won’t soon forget….;34.0282633333334;-117.941535833333
Intelligently guided stretch flight flies over La Puente, October 21 1:45 PM.;2016-10-21 13:49:00;5 minutes;Intelligently guided stretch flight flies over La Puente, October 21 1:45 PM At approximately 1:45 PM Pacific time, I observed a stretched light traveling from north to south  ((sic.  South to north.  Corrected by witness.)) over the city of La Puente.   I was pulling out of the parking lot when I first saw the disc-like shape, it did not appear to be traveling at a high speed but as I drove forward, it began to move in the direction of where the sun was.  I am assuming because it noticed that I had seen it and it knew it would make it difficult for me to see it next to the sun.   I yelled to two people next to me to look up and see it.  They said they didn't see anything at first, so I yelled, Block the sun!   He proceeded to block the sun with his right hand, and with his left hand just gesturing to something floating near the sun on the right top corner.  I also had confirmation from a ((deleted--beverage)) delivery man delivering to the corner store where I was exiting.  Once we were all looking at it it appeared to fly directly over us and as it passed us it was moving northbound towards the Azuza Canyons.  ' The entire thing lasted about four minutes, and as I drove away to try to reach my house, I also told people on the road to look up and they also saw what I saw.  By  time I made it home it was gone.  There was a total of five witnesses.  ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be an eloquent and serious-minded individual.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.
