UFO over the San Gabriel Valley;2006-05-17 21:30:00;50 min.;UFO over the San Gabriel Valley I was out walking my dog and at about 9:30P.M. when I saw the red light in the sky.  It did not move like an ordinary airplane you see over Los Angeles, rather it moved like something I have never seen before.  I saw the object move very slowly and it never got close nor did it move away like a normal plane would.  I called out my parents to see if they could see what I was seeing and they also saw what i was seeing.  By this time the object was moving in strange patterns.  All these movements occured in the west to the north west parts of the sky.  I saw it move very quikly to the left, right, up, down, inward, outward, and In circular motions. At one point my mother and I were able to see the shape of the craft, which was similar to a boomerang.  The red light was centered in the middle area of the craft.  We did have binoculars to see this object and this helped out in viewing it.  My parents went inside the house after observing it for a while, but I stayed out and saw it linger there for quite a while. As i watched it, my neighboor had just arrived home and I told her if she could see the same thing.  She wanted to go inside her house after a long day, but she stood out for a few moments to observe this craft.  We looked at it together and it did some king of loop-de-loop action then it dipped down and dissapeared from sight at approximaetly  10:20 P.M.  The duration of the sighting was for 50 min.;34.0282633333334;-117.941535833333
