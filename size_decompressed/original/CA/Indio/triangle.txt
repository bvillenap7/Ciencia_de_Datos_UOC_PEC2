A unidentified triangular object with three white lights in each corner, flying West to East in a fast pace.;2012-04-21 01:00:00;30 seconds;A unidentified triangular object with three white lights in each corner, flying West to East in a fast pace. I was at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival when my spotting occurred.  I had just got back to my camping spot right after the concert had ended, around 1:00am, which means I was away from the festival lights.  A friend pointed out an unidentified object flying overhead.  It was flying fairly high at a fast pace, from West to East.  The object was a dark gray, triangular shaped, with a white light in each of itâ€™s corners, and about as large as a jet. It did not seem to be like a jet, nor did it make any sound. I watched as it disappeared into the night sky.  There were several planes flying that night, including advertising planes for the concert.  I do recall seeing the object after a plane flying by. In addition, I saw a fast moving white light that resembled a moving star, which I concluded as a satellite. I read on a Coachella message board that other had seen unidentified objects as well, however not similar to mine.
