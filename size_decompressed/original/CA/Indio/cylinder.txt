Indio, CA, object explodes above my house.   ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 17:55:00;30 minutes;Indio, CA, object explodes above my house. I saw what looked like a flashlight shaped object the size of a sedan car with a large light moving from left to right, then it exploded and a large amount of green smoke came out of it.    What was strange was that the object never made any noise even when it exploded.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));33.7245135371181;-116.222571179039
