Multi-colored ball;2006-11-03 18:30:00;20 sec.;Multi-colored ball Girlfriend and I were driving back to California on I-10 about 20 miles outside east of Indio when we both look up to see a mutliple colored ball falling to the earth.  Naturally we freaked out thinking we were being nuked when we look up again to see it go up in a zig zag pattern.  It looked massive and I know others on I-10 had to have seen it.  The colors of the trail or whatever it was looked like the colors of the rainbow.  It reappeared but at a further distance away and went from white to red and disapeared.  As far as size, it was about the size of the moon from where we saw it.  It looked as if were going to crash into Indio itself, we were 20 miles outside of Indio, so imagine how big this thing had to be.  I wish I had never seen it....;33.7245135371181;-116.222571179039
