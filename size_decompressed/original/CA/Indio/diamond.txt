A massive transparent diamond shaped object.;2015-01-16 17:55:00;4 minutes;A massive transparent diamond shaped object. Massive formation lower than the clouds.  You could see the perimeter of it, but it was transparent, like if you were to put a clear shaped dining piece of glass underwater and then moved it.  You would still be able to see it, even though it's transparent...that's the best way we can describe it.   There were 3 lights along one side, and appeared to be flying slightly askew.  The noise that it made was a deep massive, ground rolling roar, almost like a jet plane.   It flew parallel to us as we stood in the backyard, watching and it veered off to the right until it was out of our line of sight.;33.7245135371181;-116.222571179039
Unknown black, diamond-shaped craft, slightly smaller than an F-16.;2016-01-29 11:20:00;20 seconds;Unknown black, diamond-shaped craft, slightly smaller than an F-16. 11:20 this morning, I was sitting at my desk at work, when I heard what sounded like the cracking of a whip followed by a low level hum or vroom sound.   I got up from my desk and went out the front door of the shop.  When I looked up (north – northwest direction), I saw a Black Diamond shaped craft with  what looked like 2 triangle- shaped fins off of the back end of it.   As soon as I saw it, 2 F-16's flew over head in pursuit.  They were at roughly 5500 feet.  I'm guessing on the altitude here…  The Black Diamond shape craft made a sharp turn to the right over the mountains and headed east.  The 2 F-16's made their (much slower) banking turn to follow.  I'm not sure what type of engine was in the Black Diamond shaped craft, but it took off straight east faster than anything that I've ever seen.   The 2 F-16's light up their engines and gave pursuit.  But not anywhere near as fast as the Black Diamond shaped craft.   This all lasted maybe 20 seconds before they were out of sight, heading east towards Blythe.;33.7245135371181;-116.222571179039
