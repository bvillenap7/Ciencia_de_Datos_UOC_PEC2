Lights appear and disappear much like the Phoenix light sightings;2017-04-10 21:15:00;10 minutes;Lights appear and disappear much like the Phoenix light sightings After the meteor/fireball that most of southern California saw tonight, there started to appear orange lights in the sky.  They appeared one by one, and then disappeared, sometimes together, and other times separate.  They came into formation once or twice.  This was almost identical to the Phoenix light sightings, as well as others like it from around the world.  I took full video of the event until it stopped.  Very interesting.  Definitely not flares or anything man made.;33.7245135371181;-116.222571179039
