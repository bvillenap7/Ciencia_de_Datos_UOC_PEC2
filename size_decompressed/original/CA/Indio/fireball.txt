Bright object breaks off into three objects and then joins and breaks off again before making an abrupt turn;2007-04-27 21:40:00;8 SECONDS;Bright object breaks off into three objects and then joins and breaks off again before making an abrupt turn Was laying down and observing the shooting stars.  Then what appeared to be a very large bright star came across the sky from the east and was heading in a westerly direction.  The object then broke off into three stars and that is when I told my partner to look at that shooting star, within a second the object came back together as one and then broke off into three seperate units.  Within a few seconds the objects make a sharp turn to the north.  We could not identify what we saw, as a pilot, I knew it was not an aircraft, due to the speed and abrupt maneuvers the object was making.;33.7245135371181;-116.222571179039
Comet-like fireball with Red & Green lights seen in Coachella Valley, CA;2007-11-02 19:20:00;5 minutes;Comet-like fireball with Red & Green lights seen in Coachella Valley, CA I was on my back porch (facing south) and saw what looked like a shooting star falling from the sky.  It lasted approximately 5 seconds.  It seemed to burn out toward then end, then all I saw was a blinking craft.  It turned the oppsoite direction and lit up again.  It was a bright light with a long flaming tail.  It kept moving in all directions randomly and sometimes it would burn out to a dim blinking (like a normal airplane).  After it continued for over a minute I called my 4 year old daughter to come see.  She thought it was fireworks.  We watched and the tail sparks turned into circular lights and glowed red at times and green.  At some point it looked like it was heading straight for the ground then it would curve up and the tail would light up like a tail of a meteor.  It continued for 5 minutes or more.  I kept telling my daughter to go get her grandma, she has to see this.  It kept changing directions and would glow red then white/yellow and then green.  I ran inside finally and grabbed my camera.  I was able to capture 3 short video feeds and one still picture.  I am convinced there must be some kind of explination for what we saw, I just haven't been able to find anything in our local news.  Maybe someone else saw it too.;33.7245135371181;-116.222571179039
Orange ball of light.;2014-04-21 01:00:00;15 minutes;Around 1 am, the night of Easter Sunday, I witnessed what I thought was a comet heading in a slanted direction to my right.   As it grew slightly closer I realized it was way to small and slow to be a comet, but maybe a helicopter.  I then knew it wasn't a helicopter because it was too fast.   After moving at a slight angle to our right it curved its direction and starting heading away from us.   My friend had said it might be a flare, but we all knew otherwise and it had been getting further and further away slowly.  It looked like a fireball at first, but without any fire, then more like just a big orange ball of light, but was too far away to see any detail at all.   After moving further away it disappeared.   We were shocked, but I knew it just was too far to see, until it came back into sight heading back in our direction.  It came back to the point that it had been at before, moving slowly compared to any meteor, but fast compared to a firework.   It then turned back around almost instantly without rotating and then slowly disappeared again.   This lasted for about 8 to maybe 12 minutes in total.;33.7245135371181;-116.222571179039
5 round fire like balls in flight pattern over Coachella Valley.;2014-08-02 18:00:00;7-12 minutes;5 round fire like balls in flight pattern over Coachella Valley Was in back yard looked up and what appeared to be a helicopter but bright continous light (no flashing indicators) I followed the object as it was heading from the west to east as I then noticed 4 others following same flight pattern. the objects flew east then b-lined upward due south.   The object was foreign enough for me to run and grab my wife who also acknowledged it as a foreign object.  The objects were round almost fire burning with zero sound and fluid movement.  Both wife & I are very skeptical of things like this but it was not anything we have ever seen before.   There had to be other sightings of this as they were all to obvious.

A fireball object burnt orange color with lights falling from it.;2019-11-16 01:30:00;2 minutes;A fireball object burnt orange color with lights falling from it. I saw a burnt orange color object hovering & drops of light fell off of it.  I saw 3 drops of light fall down like it was dripping.  I woke my partner to see it & it slowly flew away.  It hovered for a while before it flew away.  It was a very burnt orange color & at first I thought maybe it was Mars until I saw objects falling from it.  Like lights coming down or falling down.;33.7245135371181;-116.222571179039
