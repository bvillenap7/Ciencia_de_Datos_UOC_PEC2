On the morning of 10-10-07 my wife and I had just left a gas station in Indio, Ca. .We were traveling East on I-10. My wife was driving at this time. It was just getting light,and the sky was a perfect blue. There were no clouds visible at all.  Then I looked to the south,and over the top of a moutain was a perfectly oval cloud.  I turned to my wife to comment how unusual the cloud was.  When I looked back there were 2 identical clouds. I looked back at my wife excited at what I had just witnessed.  When she looked at the clouds,she saw a smaller object come out of the bottom,front, do a short figure eight,and shot back up into the cloud .Being upset that I didnot see this.   I watched both oval shaped clouds until they dissapered into the rising sun. I do watch the clouds more often.;33.7245135371181;-116.222571179039
Two perfectly shaped oval white clouds suddenly appeared,then a pod flew out and returned back up into the cloud.;2010-10-05 06:00:00;15 minutes;Two perfectly shaped oval white clouds suddenly appeared,then a pod flew out and returned back up into the cloud. Early October 2010, my wife and I were traveling east on I-10 at the Arizona border.  We just fueled up and traded drivers.  It was just getting light and the sun had not come over the horizon yet.  I just commented how blue the sky was.   As I looked to the south I noticed an unusual perfectly oval white cloud that seemed to just appear.  I made comment to my wife.   As I was talking to her, she looked up and saw a pod come out of the cloud do a figure 8 and go back into the cloud.    When I looked back there were 2 clouds not one.  We were doing the speed limit of 75 miles an hour and the sun just broke over the horizon.  The clouds were traveling slightly faster than we were driving.   They stayed in a perfect formation headed east parallel to the highway.  They gradually advanced in front of us until they went into the rising sun and we no longer could see them. The pod was oval in shape with one-forth  a clear canopy, which allowed her to see a pilot. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
