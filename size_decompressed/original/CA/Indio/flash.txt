It was a red light that would turn blue and then back to red.  It would alternate colors about every two seconds. it could climb wiggle turn descend. It was similar to watching a fly or insects fly pattern, very erratic.  It was flying 2 or 3 times as fast as a typical air plane.  As I was watching it i felt so confused as I couldn't explain what I was seeing to myself.  It is a strange feeling because in this age there is hardly anything we can't explain so I was mezmerized.;33.7245135371181;-116.222571179039
