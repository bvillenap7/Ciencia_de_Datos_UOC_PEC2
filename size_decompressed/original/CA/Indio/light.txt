Hovered in sky, then flew parallel to horizon extremely fast (w/o tail) in a stright line, stopped again. Hovered, then traveled downwards(?), tail reappearing in a circular spiraling pattern like a fishhook around object, then disappeared. My girlfriend(graduate student in music at a university) and I (housepainter) were driving westbound on I-10 returning to California from a trip to Phoenix, AZ. At approx. 7:30 PM we saw what looked like a plane or a rocket taking off or flying slightly up and souhtbound in the sky directly ahead. It had a large orange tail. It got to a cretain height and then stopped cold. It then moved across the sky parallel to the horizon very fast and covered a lot of sky quickly. It stopped again, sat there for a minute, then it moved downward, tail reappearing and swirling around it like a fishhook. It then disappeared. We could make out no characteristics of the object except that it was as bright as a star and the sun had set behind it in the sky.;33.7245135371181;-116.222571179039
one white light with 3 red lights, the red lights were faint but then shot out like missals.;2010-07-04 21:40:00;3 min;one white light with 3 red lights, the red lights were faint but then shot out like missals. A white light was coming from west to east it was surrounded by 3 smaller lights darting over it.  Then 4 red lights flew from the white lights and then stood stationary on one side of the white light, while they were moving the whole time.  The white light kept going east while the red lights were motionless for about 30secs.   Then all of a sudden they shot forward going in the same east direction as the white light but in a different path they moved faster than any jet fighter i ever saw.  They lit up like missiles and they traveled as fast as a shooting star.  It lit up like a reentry vehicle trailing fire behind it.  The color of the red lights were very faint like the lights weren't meant to be noticeable.  They looked like dull red comets I looked through my local news and researched but i guess no one else saw/reported it.
