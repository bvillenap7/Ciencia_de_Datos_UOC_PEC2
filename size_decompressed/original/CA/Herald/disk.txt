UFO in the sky on my drive home from school;2008-05-15 22:30:00;15 minutes;UFO in the sky on my drive home from school It was my senior year of high school (I now am a college sophomore) when I drove home from theatre rehearsal.  I live deep in the country and the country roads are always very dark and empty at night.  I was about 3 miles away from my house when I noticed a collection of lights in the sky.  I offhandedly thought that the lights were stadium lights from a nearby baseball field.   As I approached the lights, I realized not only that there wasn’t a field nearby, but I was encountering something out of a nightmare.  The cluster of three lights was in a triangle formation and belonged to an aircraft that hovered silently over the road.   I watched the aircraft for a few seconds and observed how it was motionless, like no other aircraft that I had ever seen.  I took a different road that didn’t require me to go underneath the aircraft and drove home.  About a month later, I saw the same style of aircraft, again, about two miles from my house.
