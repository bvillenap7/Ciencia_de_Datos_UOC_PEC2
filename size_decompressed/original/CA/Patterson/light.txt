You were able to see it with the naked eye, as the moon went across the sky the point of light stayed in the same place from were we first saw it. I video tape the object, it did not move or changed in brightness I called my brother in-law who lives about 30 miles away and ask him to look up at the moon his first reaction was that it was a star, but I told him it has been in the same spot for about 20 min all-ready. I did not see when it went away or bliked out when I look up again about 8:55pm it was gone. If anyone could help me out on who I could show the video to that would be great. Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the light may have been one of the bright planets, which currently are very prominent in the western sky during the early evening.  We will look at the video.  PD));37.4792;-121.1644
That I lost sight of them when they were still pretty close to where I was standing.;2005-08-11 23:30:00;60 seconds;That I lost sight of them when they were still pretty close to where I was standing. I was watching the the shooting stars, when I saw 2 dots flying almost next to each other but one was a little behind the other,I have seen this befor and assumed they were satellities, then I saw a third dot ahead of the other two flying a little bit to the left of the outside one. (They were going South from North). Most of the time I can see them for a long way off from were I'am standing but when these went just past the top of my head I lost view of them I should have been able to see them for a long way off they were pretty bright. There were no color lights or blinking, that's about it. And I couldn't see them any more, if you put a dime with your arm streched out they probably could all fit that's how close they were.;37.4792;-121.1644
Bright orangish light to the naked eye but white saucer with a black dot in the middle in picture.;2014-07-10 22:15:00;6 minutes;Bright orangish light to the naked eye but white saucer with a black dot in the middle in picture. The object was just hovering in the sky for six minutes.  It was a bright orange light.   I took a picture and when I looked at the picture the object looked like a white circle with a black dot in the middle of it.  It did not fly off it just vanished.  This was my second time seeing this object and the first time I was able to get a picture.;37.4792;-121.1644
