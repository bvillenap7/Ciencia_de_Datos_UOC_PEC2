When there was a plane comming from the West headed to the East, the object was comming from the North, I could not hear any noise from the object and both objects seemed to be about the same height in the air. When the plane went by and the object was moving South-East there was no blinking lights only what look like a dome in front and it was lite up but not bright where you couldn't see anything of the object, after the plane moved away from the object and I didn't see any blinking lights or hear any noise I flashed my flash light at it with four blinks, no response I did it again and about 1 to 2 secounds the objects light went off, and I couldn't see it against the stars. It didn't leave a trail and I still didn't hear any noise, there was a football game going on to the East of the object so hopefully some one else saw it to. Below the only light was in ! front.;37.4792;-121.1644
