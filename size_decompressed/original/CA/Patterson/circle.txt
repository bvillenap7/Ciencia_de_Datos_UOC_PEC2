The cone went from northwest to south east with a beam from the top point of the cone to the bottom.  A small circular craft flew northwest out of the tip of the cone and continued as the cone dissipated. The beam dissipated more slowly and 10 minutes after my initial visual still lingered, though much smaller. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));37.4792;-121.1644
