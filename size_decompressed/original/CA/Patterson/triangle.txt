3 lights hovering and flying past the freeway in Patterson, CA.;2010-05-28 02:37:00;30 seconds;3 lights hovering and flying past the freeway in Patterson, CA. It was coming at us on the freeway.  The driver, myself and another passenger were in the vehicle. We saw 2 lights coming toward us. It looked like a LARGE craft.  We could not make out the shape or see the craft itself, but it had 3 distinctive lights and was maneuvering back and forth and from side to side and zoomed off into the dark before disappearing.  If you could connect the dots (3 lights) it would probably make a boomerang shape.  We could not tell how far or close it was from us, but we all saw it clear as day.  No helicopter or airplane could move the way this craft moved, nor did it have any sound.;37.4792;-121.1644

One of the lights in the formation was flickering but not constantly.  All I can say is that this was moving way too slow to be a commercial aircraft or too big to be a light plane.  Pointed it out to my fellow commuter and he agreed.;37.4792;-121.1644
Triangle shape object, followed by 2 lights, 1 very bright and the other about the brightness of a star.;2013-01-31 18:00:00;2 minutes;Triangle shape object, followed by 2 lights, 1 very bright and the other about the brightness of a star. I was in my back yard in Patterson CA 95363, looking at the stars, clear night no clouds,I had my flash lite with me and would flash it in the sky every so often.   As I was looking up I saw what I thought was a star formation of a triangle, but then I notice it was moving very slow South-East, the point of the triangle was North-East and the other 2 light were South-West, it was very long and there was no noise, or blinking lights all I could see were the 3 lights, as it moved away it dim out, all the lights at ounce.  I flashed my lite at it while it was lite up but I didn't get no response, and it was gone.  Then came 2 planes from the East and South-East, one was very loud and the other one was bigger, they made one past and were gone.   I keep flashing my light into the sky but nothing, in till about 6:46 pm, I look to the South-West and there were 2 lights in the sky one was lower then the other and was very bright and it looked like it was directed at me, the other light was higher and to the left of the brighter one and as bright as the stars if not more, there was no noise or blinking of lights. I t made me feel that it came from the triangle,  I flashed my light at both of them but I didn't get any response, I even used my flash lite and lite up my roof back and fourth with the light but nothing, they were both just hovering there, and there lights both went out at about the same time.  It lasted about 2 minutes.I looked at my phone and it showed 6:46 pm. I didn't see any outline of the objects when there lights went out. That's about it.;37.4792;-121.1644
