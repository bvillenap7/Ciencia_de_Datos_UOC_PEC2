White dot 70-80 degrees up N/E , clear sky with other objects near and around main object.;2019-08-12 08:00:00;15 minutes;White dot 70-80 degrees up N/E , clear sky with other objects near and around main object. White dot on a clear blue sky hovering with the naked eye looked like a white dot/star but thru binoculars it was oval shape, the end towards the sun was bright but as you moved to the other side it was transparent or clear.  I did not see any others objects in the sky at that point I was using my camcorder at the same time after the event and when the tape ran out I viewed the tape on my tv and could see the object which looked like a white dot I could also see multiple objects near and around object.  When I first turn the camcorder towards the object I had a big glare in the view box I tried to shade it, but it didn’t work so I pointed it in the general area and I did get the object not knowing that I had it I moved the camcorder again think I had a better angle in which I didn’t, I was either above or below at this point but I still was catching other objects zipping around.;37.4792;-121.1644
A bright white dot in a clear blue sky hovering over or between Turlock and Patterson CA at approximately 70-80 degrees up.;2019-08-12 08:00:00;15:00 minutes;A bright white dot in a clear blue sky hovering over or between Turlock and Patterson CA at approximately 70-80 degrees up. Object was a white dot in a clear blue sky, when I looked at it thur binoculars it was oval shape and looked different then with the naked eye it was white on the edge towards the sun and the rest looked transparent, clear and oval in shape.   I had my camcorder set up, but I had a bad glare so I pointed it in the general direction of the object, when reviewing the chip on the tv I could see the object and other objects zipping near and around the main object I could not see the other objects with the naked eyes or the binoculars.  I didn’t see the object leave with the naked eye but I could see it was gone, while in the process of trying to film the object I moved the angle of  camcorder which was on a tripod and at one point lost it but was still in the general area and still caught other objects, when I could no longer see the main object I reposition the camcorder at house level and let it run in till the tape had ended.  There were no objects at that level only when it was positioned up at about 70-80 degrees up.;37.4792;-121.1644
Bright white dot in a all blue sky just hovering approximately 70-80 degrees up N-E towards Turlock CA;2019-08-12 08:00:00;15 minutes;Bright white dot in a all blue sky just hovering approximately 70-80 degrees up N-E towards Turlock, CA. 8am approximately I was in my backyard video taping as I was reading I looked up and there was a small white dot, I got my binoculars and looked, it was oval shape and the end towards the sun was bright but as you moved to the left it was transparent looking,  I pointed my camcorder at it but had a glare on the view screen which I could not shade so I pointed the camcorder in the general direction  after awhile I readjusted the camcorder  thinking it was a better angle, after the object left I lowered the camcorder  to almost a level view.  After the tape ended I looked at the tape on tv at first I did have it on the camcorder and it looked like a white dot and there were other objects flying near and around it when I readjusted at one point I did lose the object but was in the same general area and caught more objects the main object was still there though I didn’t level the camcorder in till the object left.;37.4792;-121.1644
