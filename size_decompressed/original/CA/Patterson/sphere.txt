While I was watching it go South to North along the West coast I saw a little object fly behind the Jet or Plane going up at around a 45degree angle and it was out of view in around 5 secounds while the Jet or Plane was still there for another 20 seconds or so,it was still going North West. I do have it on my Camcord.;37.4792;-121.1644
Three orange/red spheres in alignment leaving one at a time.;2014-01-01 00:12:00;10 minutes;Three orange/red spheres in alignment leaving one at a time. January 1, 2014, 12:10 AM   I stepped out onto the back patio to hear the music from a neighborhood party.  I immediately saw two red spheres in the night sky.  I came in and got my camera and started taking photos.  A third sphere joined the other two.  They remained evenly spaced and in a horizontal line.  I continued taking rapid photos, 15 in all.  The spheres appeared to ‘fade’ one at a time  but looking at the photos with zoom, they were still in the pictures and seemed they had left ‘away’ from me to a greater distance.  The photos are time stamped from 1:12 AM thru 1:16 AM because my camera was still set on Daylight Saving Time.  The photos are very interesting when enlarged.  I don’t have television so I didn’t hear of other reports.  My daughter sent me the activity from your site and so I thought I should report what I had seen and photographed.;37.4792;-121.1644
