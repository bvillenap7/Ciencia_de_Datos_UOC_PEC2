Small black spherical object observed in the eastern horizon at about 30 degrees;2006-04-18 10:38:00;2 to 3 minutes;Small black spherical object observed in the eastern horizon at about 30 degrees I was sitting on my porch facing east at 10:38a.m. to catch some rays when I noticed at about a 30 degree angle on the horizon a small black spherical object just suspended in the air completely motionless. The sky was completely clear except for a couple very smeall, very thin, barely visible clouds and there was not even a hint of a breeze out. At first I thought it was a bird - the kind that can flap their wings fast enough to just remain relatively motionless, which I have observed on several other occasions - but then I saw a crow fly directly in front of it and it just remained totally motionless although it did seem to be quite a distance off behind the crow but still I didn't notice any kind of movement whatsoever from the object for quite some time, probably a good 2 to 3 minutes or so. Then I thought it was a kite but then rejected that thought immediately since there was absolutely no wind or even so much as a hint of a breeze. Then I thought that it was a baloon of some sort but couldn't justify why it would just sit there completely motionless for such a long time - at least 2 to 3 minutes. I went in to get my digital camera and it was still there when I got back but unfortunately the batteries in the camera needed recharging so I wasn't able to get any footage of it. The object slowly & deliberately moved down and to the south behind some trees & out of sight.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
A bright object moving in no set pattern.;2006-08-14 20:00:00;3 hours;A bright object moving in no set pattern. This is a picture I took 10 years ago.  My wife and I watched a bright object at dusk moving in no set pattern for 2 hours.  This was during the meteor shower in August, in the mountain area east of Eureka, CA. ((NUFORC Note:  Photos shows irregular, meandering streak of light, of unknown origin.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Driving at night near the Northern California Coast - six orange orbs in the sky;2012-06-29 23:15:00;5 minutes;Driving at night near the Northern California Coast - six orange orbs in the sky Witness one - I was in the passenger seat of a car when I saw six orange orbs in the sky.  They appeared to be floating slowly.  Before the driver could pull over, four appeared to get further away (into space) and changed their color to blue, looking like any other star in the sky.  Witness two - I was driving when witness one alerted me to the orange lights in the sky.  By the time I was able to safely pull over and look, only two lights remained.  The seemed to be moving slowly or they were a far distance away.  One seemed to grow bigger as it got &quotcloser.&quot  Suddenly one disappeared (like the other four), then one reappeared shortly after quite far from where the other disappeared.  The remaining orb of the first two looked as if it was disappearing, but then it just changed to a bluish color that matched the night sky and made it look like a star.  The other orb moved slowly and then shortly disappeared after the other one.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
Large, orangish sphere over Eureka, CA. Here one minute, gone the next.;2018-01-28 03:00:00;1 minute;Large, orangish sphere over Eureka, CA. Here one minute, gone the next. It was very large, bright and orangish in color.  Too big and round to be either a planet or an aircraft.  It was moving rather slowly from what I could see, but probably because it looked far away, even for its size. It seemed to fade out a bit after I first noticed it.  I rushed back into the house to get binoculars but, as soon as I was back out in the yard with binoculars, it was completely gone.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
