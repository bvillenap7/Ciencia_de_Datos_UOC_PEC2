Three of us when noticing a string 40 to 50 lights.  ((Starlink satellites??));2019-12-23 18:00:00;4 minutes;Three of us were out fishing north of Eureka California ,total darkness other than flashlights when noticing a string 40 to 50 lights at very high altitude following each other across the sky, amazing sight all evenly spaced headed north easterly direction, there was no telling how many we missed before we noticed them.  There was no sound seem like an endless stream of them, we did see two flying to one side of them following at the same speed that we're not quite as bright they all seem perfectly spaced.  Surely not something you see everyday or nite.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
