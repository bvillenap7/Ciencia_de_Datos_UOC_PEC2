It was during the fist part of the month and about in the middle of the week.Upon going outside the kids said there was a dragoon in the sky,(their native americans) anyway I looked up and sure as shit there were several silver disc shaped things in the air. It was a very bright afternoon and the sun reflected off of them and they were silver.They formed some weird shape in a formation like pattern.The kids said it looked like a dragon.I did not put it together.We watched these things almost to the point of like they were supposed to be there.Accepted , is the only thing that comes to mind. One of them came over us and just stayed there and it looked like flames were shooting out to the west of the craft and these things were oriented to the South.Our eyes began to see dots from staring at them for so long we had to quit looking and take a eye break. I did not have any portable optics to enhance the viewing so we were screwed from a detailed look.Finally the one that hovered over slowly backed up until it was gone.My 73 yo mom even saw the one shoot flames out the side.And the others simply vanished from view before we even noticed. We watched for about a half an hour.I or anyone else was scared it was almost likethey belonged there some how, I don't know. This was during the start up phase of the war in Iraq that is why I was listening to my shortwave radio.Sorry about the date no body can remember the exact day or date. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will encourage the witness to have the other witnesses to the alleged event submit reports, as well.  PD));40.787301980198;-124.162967326732

The metal was shiny and reflective.  I was working with a client of mine who yelled Look up!  What is that?  I looked up and I noticed the disc shaped metallic object in the sky.  It was very reflective!  As I passed a set of trees it was gone!  I know this is very similar to the other guys story on 8/ something/2016, but the stories were exactly the same and even over a bay!  The only thing different was that the clouds around that area were all bowed.  The further we drove the more the clouds went back to normal.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
