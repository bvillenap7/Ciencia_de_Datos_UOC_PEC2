Very large dancing fireball, 35-40 degrees above NE horizon, with additional small fiery lights emerging and descending toward horizon;2003-12-17 19:45:00;7 minutes;Very large dancing fireball, 35-40 degrees above NE horizon, with additional small fiery lights emerging and descending toward horizon On Wednesday, December 17th, at around 7:45pm.  What looked like a large ball of fire (10x the size of largest nearby star), pulsating from red to orange, danced like a firefly 34-40 degrees above the NE horizon for 2-3 minutes.  Then the object stopped flashing red-orange, turned solid reddish-orange and remained somewhat stationary for another maybe 2 minutes, during which time much smaller (small-star-sized) red-orange object(s) appeared from within and below the large fiery object and proceeded to approach the horizon, forming a completely vertical dotted line of small fiery lights extending from the larger object.  As the line of smaller lights proceeded towards the horizon, the distance between the smaller fiery lights and the larger original object grew greater until the smaller objects were within a couple of degrees from the horizon and then disappeared one by one.  The large fireball remained stationary for about another minute after the smaller ones disappeared, then it began flashing red-orange and started dancing again, still in the same location.  Then the light dimmed and the object danced off to the north, remaining 35-40 degrees above the horizon.  It traveled in this manner for 45 seconds or so, through a distance of air space that usually takes a satellite 3-4 times longer to pass through, and then it just disappeared.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
Can firballs move like that?;2004-01-12 07:49:00;2 minutes;Can firballs move like that? In Eureka, Ca at the time specified above we saw 7 round shaped fireballs or what looked as such travelling across the sky slower than a shooting star or a falling satellite. the objest were not in a falling movement, they were traveling in a kriss-cross shape about a mile apart from each other.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
Orange light in the sky, two smaller orange lights emitted from bottom like teardrops.;2010-03-06 20:00:00;One minute;Orange light in the sky, two smaller orange lights emitted from bottom like teardrops. I was driving in my city of Eureka when I looked up into the sky and in the near distance saw an orange light.  At first I thought it was a bright star, but it was much bigger (closer) and couldn't have been.  It seemed to be moving further away when all of a sudden 2 smaller orange lights came from under it, like teardrops, one, and then the other right behind it.  The object did this again a minute later, dropping two teardrop lights from it.  I've never seen anything quite like it, and there were other witnesses.  The object ended up floating into the distance beyond sight.  I don't know what this is, and would like some feedback if anyone does know what I might have seen.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
Gigantic Red Ball of light at a very high altitude that vanished.;2012-06-30 09:00:00;60 seconds;Gigantic Red Ball of light at a very high altitude that vanished. For about 60 seconds I noticed there was a Gigantic Red Ball of light at a very high altitude.  It moved at what looked like a steady pace (unlike a meteorite, or fireworks) from the time I noticed it until I looked away.  When I looked back again it was gone.  This was inconsistent with its speed and trajectory.  So either it went totally light discipline, sped away, or vanished completely.   As, I could not locate it anywhere in the sky.
