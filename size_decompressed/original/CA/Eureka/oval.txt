silver globe spotted over humboldt bay;1970-06-09 15:00:00;1 minute;silver globe spotted over humboldt bay The Coast Guard had their helicopter up and hovering, it brought me out back. I live just off the 101 and have nothing in between my home and the ocean. The chopper noise brought me outside, I saw a silver globe fly through the air, it moved like something out of a video game before leaving my view. I'm not really sure what brought my eye to it but like I said the way it moved through the air was different then anything I've ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.787301980198;-124.162967326732

Was seen in the same area both times. My girlfriend saw this UFO first early in the morning while out on the back porch of our house, she woke me out of bed and I observed this object with her, the second time, the same thing happenned and she told me to come quick, with an alerted tone in her voice.  Both times I grabbed the binoculars, after seeing this object, I saw anything from a triangle shaped light, to an oval, with the bright lights varying in hue from green, to yellow or orange.  Then it would go totally dark and a single dim red light, but a faint large outline of a object could be seen.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
