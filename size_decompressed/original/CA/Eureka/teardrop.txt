Outside the window of my apartment, I sighted at 07:15, 12-9-98, a bright, shimmering, orange colored massive object(1)descending at a moderately fast controlled rate on a straight path to earth. Hard to judge size and speed because of distance (about 100-150 miles south of Humboldt County California) but very massive size moving at a high speed judging from distance. Sighted near horizon just above tree line south. Looked like a planet or very large star (about 8 stars together) at first but with binoculars sighted a tear drop shape(U) with hole in center descending at the speed that of a jet plane would in the distance or even faster. Before sighting, there were 5 jet planes going towards the location where the object was descending which directed my attention to that area. There were 2 more jets following the other five after I sighted the object (7 jets all together going on same route towards object within 10 min.) Object disappeared behind tree line and so did 5 jets except for the 2 which were still visible but then dissapeared behind tree line also. The sun was not quite over the hills yet, but the 7 jet streams were all pink and the sky was very clear with no clouds. The temperature was about 45 degrees F. outside. The moon was in its last quarter stage but nowhere close to the horizon. I was wide awake and had been up for about an hour and had a very restful sleep. Five minutes after the object disappeared, 2 jets were still visible and I had to leave for a class at 08:00. I am a Senior at Humboldt State University majoring in art. I was born in Texas and served in the U.S. army for 5 years. I am married, 30 years old, caucasion, 130 lbs. and very skeptical of everything. I am well educated in many areas and self-taught in many subjects. I have never seen anything like this before but heard many things about this subject and always found the stories hard to believe. What I saw was unbelievable, but it was real.  Please contact me if possible at lrm5@axe.humboldt.edu if you have any other info! rmation about this sighting or others like it. Thankyou.
