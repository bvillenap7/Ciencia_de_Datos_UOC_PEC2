large slow moving triange-shaped aircraft flies over Eureka California... 1997;1997-11-15 22:00:00;3 mins;large slow moving triange-shaped aircraft flies over Eureka California... 1997 at about 10 0'clock on a weekday night (I can't remmember exactly what day it was, becuse it was a few years ago)  I saw a triangle craft that appeared to be anywhere from 50ft to 200ft in length (I couldn't be sure, I have no experience with determining aircraft length), on the bottem side, it had three ultra-bright lights down the center from front to aft... two red lights on the left side, (one was pulsating), one green light on the right side... On the Aft side, it had what appeared to be two very large engines which glowed orange, but had no afterburn/flames/variation in intensity... the object made no noise that I was aware of, and had no wings/rudder/rotar blades/elevator/landing gear/windows/antenie/flaps/markings of any kind/etc... the object was moving slowly in a south-east direction, and took about 5 mins to disapear over the horrizon. In addition to the craft discribed above, I witnessed several red blinking lights just above the horrizon in all directions... I would estimate about 12 red lights... however, there is not very much air traffic in my town. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.787301980198;-124.162967326732

I witnessed an elongated, triangular aircraft moving at a very slow speed approximately trenty feet above the Redwood trees.;2004-09-17 23:30:00;10 minutes;I witnessed an elongated, triangular aircraft moving at a very slow speed approximately trenty feet above the Redwood trees. On the night of September 17, 2004 at approximately 11:30pm, as I was driving home, I witnessed an elongated, triangular aircraft that was traveling the opposite direction.  It was continuously moving a very slow speed, approximately twenty feet above the Redwood trees.  I made a u-turn and followed it at about thirty mph in my car, for almost two miles as it flew slowly northward in a straight path.  There were cars behind me so I pulled to the curb and I watched it for a couple of minutes to see what it would do next.  It continued northward for about two minutes, then made a gradual turn and headed south, in the same path and manner as it had previously gone.  I rolled down my window so I could hear what kind of sound the aircraft had, which was only a low humming motor sound.  I turned and followed it in my car for about three more minutes, when it disappeared from my sight over the trees.  I could only see the bottom of the aircraft because it was traveling so low and the top was not illuminated.  What I saw looked like it was made of galvanized steel, with a ridge from front to back on each side.  The bottom was flat and there was a red light on each of its three points.  There was a green light on the right front side near the red light in the front.  The green light only flashed twice when the craft was headed north and I couldn't see the green light when it was headed south.  The red lights gradually faded, but never went completely off, then got bright again, about every two seconds.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
Single silent V-shaped ufo seen in southern sky over Eureka, Ca. at about  8pm on Jan. 20, 2007.;2007-01-20 10:00:00;2-3 minutes;Single silent V-shaped ufo seen in southern sky over Eureka, Ca. at about  8pm on Jan. 20, 2007. Between 8 and 8:30 pm on Sunday Jan. 20, 2007 I was standing on the deck at the south side of my house in Eureka, Ca, looking south into the night sky.  What I first thought was an airplane or helicopter moving slowly north for about 15 to 20 seconds then began to change direction more to the north east.  I thought, it must be correcting for landing an Arcata/Eureka airport in McKinleyville.  It traveled on its new course for about 10 more seconds then seemed to change course again and head south.  As it moved away, the lights got dimmer and flickered like a cloud was crossing in front of the object, and then the lights went out completely.  1 or 2 seconds later, I saw a grey wedge-shaped object flying with its right edge downward, west towards the ocean.  It looked much larger than a plane, but was not making any noise and no longer had any lights on it.  I waited for a loud noise of a crash when I lost sight of it behind the tree line but didn’t hear anything.  	What caused me to report it was that it didn’t seem like it should be able to travel across the sky on edge.  (No lift…?);40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
Triangle shaped UFO Silently Flies Over Small Northern California Town.;2016-11-01 22:00:00;10-15 seconds;Triangle shaped UFO Silently Flies Over Small Northern California Town. We saw a triangle shaped ufo with three dimly lit white circles on each corner.  It flew silently almost right above us at a steady speed and disappeared into the horizon in about 15 seconds.   We we're shocked at how quick it moved and how it made no noise.   It seemed to be heading south maybe slightly east.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
