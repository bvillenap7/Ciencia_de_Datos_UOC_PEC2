Orange light cruises Humboldt Bay;2004-10-01 16:00:00;10-12 minutes;Orange light cruises Humboldt Bay We were in west Eureka (Near Fort Humboldt) exiting our vehicle at the house. I happened to look up and see a bright orange light in the sky moving north parallel to the coastline and bay. At first I thought it was a plane with its landing lights on except the color was a bright orange and the light was moving slowly. Eureka is often covered by a cloud deck as it was that day and I estimate it to have been about 800- 1000 (Thousand) feet above the ground. There were also patchier clouds approximately 400-600 feet above the ground though far fewer. The light was below the 800-1000 foot cloud deck, but above the 400-600 foot cloud deck. As the light moved behind the lower clouds it would become obscured momentarily. I spent probably at least five minutes just watching it from the street. By now my curiosity was raised so I went to the back yard to get a better look. It continued this path for another couple minutes. It then made a logical arcing turn westward where it began to increase velocity away from my position. The intensity of the light dissipated and it eventually disappeared.  The most similar thing you could compare it to is a helicopter with a spotlight, however their was no noise, and I tried very hard to hear anything. The light remained constant and could be compared to a flare, but it did not descend in elevation. It could have been a mylar balloon caught in different air currents, except it was emanating light (And was under the cloud deck) and was accelerating slowly. All that was visible was a orange light.  I have not seen anything like it before or after. And its been a couple years since this sighting but I remember it well and it was witnessed by one other person that I know of, and others must have seen it as well. Very interesting, love to know if others have seen something similar.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
