3 minute picture;1996-08-12 22:00:00;10 minutes;3 minute picture Saw the object which looked much as a bright star about two hour before sun set.  How ever the object keep changing directions. And after 15 or 20 minutes we lost it.  Again at 10:00 pm we saw it again.  This is when I took the picture.  You can see a top of a tree and the milkeway in the background.  The picture is about three minutes exspossure and starts on the left and heads to the right.  I like how you can see the ufo  starts slow with the thicker line of light as it pickes up speed the light line gets smaller then you see it as stoppes and changes dirctions.  We didn't see all of this with the naked eye the ufo seemed to go the same speed all the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
Two bright solid orange lights , slow moving, bright flickering light before vanishing.;2000-10-17 20:30:00;10 minutes;Two bright solid orange lights , slow moving, bright flickering light before vanishing. Last evening upon parking in front of my house, I noticed two orange lights to the east. At first I thought Fire/Coast Guard hellicopters, as there is a C.G. Base near here and we did have a large grass fire by the bay North of here. After watching maybe one minute or so I ran and called my wife to the front of our house. At this time we saw two orange lights heading Northeast of our house. They seemed to have been fairly low moving like a C.G.Hellicopter would. They were not making any sound nor were any lights flashing. After about two minutes they stopped in flight. They were motionless for another two minutes or so and my wife went to call our daughter and son-in-law who live about ten blocks from us. When she returned with phone in hand and son-in-law on the other end, we all watched the light on the left move to the North at about the same speed as before. The one on the right never moved again. After 4-5minutes the one on the right started flickering brightly and then was gone. Our son-in-law said he saw something drop from it before it's light was gone. The one to the North was visible for another 2-3 minutes and it's light flickered and it was gone too.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
Two bright orange lights rotating over Eureka;2002-12-23 23:30:00;5 min;Two bright orange lights rotating over Eureka There were bright orange star-sized lights in the sky way above the horizon.  The both were stationary at first one on the left higher than the one on the right.  Then suddenly they became parallel with each other.  Slowly the one on the left rotated downward toward the right until it was directly underneath the other.  Then they slowely blinked out of sight.  The sky was hazy and no stars could be seen.  By the time my Fiance got her camera, it was gone - of course.  There was also a large number of people down the street from us also observing the event.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
Bright, strobing light, dimmed to a pulsing amber light. Then smaller lights witnessed moving erratically around larger light.;2003-12-18 18:50:00;5-6 min.;Bright, strobing light, dimmed to a pulsing amber light. Then smaller lights witnessed moving erratically around larger light. On the evening of December 18, 2003 I saw a bright flashing light in the southeastern sky. The light was a very brilliant white, with an aparent magnitude of -5, that seemed to strobe about twice a second. After strobing for about eight seconds the light dimmed to amber color, with an aparent magnitude of -2.9. The amber object had a bit of haze around it. Then the amber object appeared to move eastward. I then saw a much smaller light that seemed to move around in an eccentric patttern beneath the first object. The smaller object proceeded to drop earthward and faded from view about halfway to the horizon. As the larger, amber object continued to move eastward, another small amber light appeared beneath the larger one and moved about much like the first smaller light. The large amber object continued to move slowly eastward for a minute or two and then appeared to fade out. The incident occured within my sight for at least five minutes. I observed the phenomenon with the aid of binoculars as well. There are currently some photos of the lights seen over Eureka, Ca., taken by another observer, posted on the website of a local radio station -- www.((URL deleted--photo removed from website)).com. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with the witness who submitted this report, and he sounds quite credible to us.  We have looked at the photo, but it seems ambiguous to us.

Large, bright light moving over Samoa Beach, then disappearing...;2010-03-18 21:04:00;5-10 minutes;Large, bright light moving over Samoa Beach, then disappearing... My wife and I had gone to the beach, as it was an unusually warm evening for mid-March. The sky was absolutely clear, with a sliver of a Moon that looked like a big smile, and tons of visible stars. I had spotted a satellite moving directly overhead moving from south to north, and we watched it until we couldn’t see it anymore. Just then, my wife says, “Look , there’s another one!”, and points due west. I turned to look, and I saw a  very, very bright white light moving from the west toward the east. The light had a blue tint to it, kind of like an LED light bulb is, as opposed to an incandescent bulb which is much more yellow. When I first turned and saw the light, it was at around 45 to 50 degrees, moving fairly quickly west to east in a straight line, it’s path just south of us. If I held an aspirin tablet between my fingers at arm’s length, that would be slightly larger, but reasonably comparable to the size of the light. It was by far the brightest thing in the sky.  As the light moved to about 85 degrees, almost directly overhead, it never deviated in intensity, flashed, or seemed directional in any way, like the headlight of a low flying airplane would. It then began to move in a wide arc toward the southeast. As it did, it began to slowly dim, until it was the size and intensity of  any random star in the sky. In fact, it now actually did look like a satellite, except for the fact that it was turning toward the southeast. We watched it for another few seconds, and then it just winked out. My wife and I were discussing what we had just seen, still facing the direction we had last seen it. I was excited, as I have witnessed the same type of light on two other occasions from my backyard (which, incidentally, faces due west), but I was always alone without any other witnesses.  As we were talking, there was a sudden bright flash of light, similar to a camera flash, at about 45 degrees, just a bit east of where we saw the light blink out, maybe 15 - 20 seconds before. We both looked up and saw what appeared to be 2 satellite sized lights moving  SE to NW in a path that would go directly over our heads. They were moving parallel to each other, although one was moving slower. As we watched, the slower one started to “pulse”. It was going from looking like a satellite, to slowly dimming until it was completely dark, and then slowly brightening back to looking like a satellite again. I then realized that the faster of the two actually was a satellite, as it continued ! across the sky in a straight line at the same speed. The “pulsing” light now started moving in a more northerly direction rather than northwesterly as it had been. It began moving slower and slower until it eventually stopped, hanging at about 55 -60 degrees in the eastern sky, doing it’s pulsating thing. As I turned back toward the northwest to see if the other satellite (which by now had passed by us) was still acting like a satellite (which it was), we noticed a small plane flying directly toward us at around 700 ft headed toward a small landing strip a mile or so down the road. I immediately looked back to the “pulsing” light. It grew dim and bright a few more times, then it stayed steadily bright, and looked like an ordinary star. The plane served as a comparison to the original light we saw come from the west. First, the plane’s headlight was very yellow in color and much dimmer. It also had obvious green and red flashing lights, and it was loud very easily heard over the breaking of the waves, whereas the mystery light was completely silent. Also, the plane’s presence gave me a sense of how high the light was. I guesstimated the plane to be at about 500 - 700 ft and descending, which made me feel like the first time we saw the light, it was about twice that height. The second time, it looked as high as the other satellite, even though it was only 15 - 20 seconds later. My wife told me that when she first saw the light and said, “Look, there’s another one”, it was the size of a satellite, and in a fraction of a second, it was super bright and huge, which is right when I saw it the first time. After the plane flew by, the light, which was now stationary, and looked like an ordinary star, faded out and we didn’t see it again. I also wanted to say that during the first part of the sighting, my wife had a feeling of dread, and had started to cry. She kept saying, “I don’t like it.” over and over. I, on the other hand, was excited, and was extremely happy to have a witness with me.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
A big circular object with a bunch of little blinking lights was hovering in the sky;2010-10-23 10:30:00;5 minutes;A big circular object with a bunch of little blinking lights was hovering in the sky My friend and I were looking out the window when we saw many little luminescent little lights around this big circular object. I didn't look like a plane or a space station. There was a gleaming shimmery trail after the UFO had disappeared after it faded into the fog;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
Multiple red flickering lights moving in unison.;2013-06-22 22:55:00;6 minutes;Multiple red flickering lights moving in unison. At least 7 objects, flickering bright red, about the same color as a highway flare, moving in a rough formation from east to west. Objects appeared brighter than the moon.  The rose slightly as they moved, all moved at the same speed.  The area of the sky involved was from about 30 to 45 degrees above the horizon, and they occupied about 60 degrees of arc.  Compared to the almost full moon, they looked to be about 1/20 the size of it to the eye. No sudden movements.  No noise.  They all faded out in order as they reached about the same area to the left of the moon about 10 degrees, like they had changed direction at that point and moved away rapidly.

White light being followed by red blinking light, moving slowly across sky.;2014-01-22 21:35:00;1-1.5 minutes;White light being followed by red blinking light, moving slowly across sky I went outside to my patio, facing east and saw what looked like a star, when I noticed next to it a stationary blinking red light.  Then the white star next to it began to move left, and the blinking red light followed, never coming nearer or farther to the white light.  The two lights traveled very slowly across the sky until they appeared to stop, about a minute later.  Then the white light flashed once, then was just gone, while the blinking red light continued to move, eventually out of my sight.;40.787301980198;-124.162967326732
