White circle of light surrounded by a red halo is spotted by the Sun;2011-05-08 15:30:00;10 minutes;White circle of light surrounded by a red halo is spotted by the Sun I was taking pictures of the sun and at first there was nothing except the sun present.  After a few shots, i noticed this red spot in the camera that looked like a red eye with a white dot of light in the middle.  I kept taking shots of the sun and each one taken had the red spot whit a dot in it. Each picture showed the spot in a different location around the sun.  Depending on how close the dot was to the sun determined how much red it had around it.  If it was far from the sun there was no red, just the dot of light.  If it was close to the sun there was a lot of red around the spot. There are a few pictures that I took of the sun behind the clouds, and in the ones where the sun is behind the clouds completely there is dot but you can see the dot and when the sun starts to come out from behind the cloud the dot of light is there and the red is slightly visible through the clouds. The red pretty much stays consistent in shape, yet in a few pictures it looks as though it has a bump on the top, like the traditional UFO shape.;39.544525;-121.50135

When I looked at the photos, I saw that there was a red circular shaped object with 3 spokes in the center in the photo near the contrail. The object looked like a red wheel with 3 spokes. I did not see the object while I was taking the photos. The object appeared in several of the photos that I took within a few minutes. The object seemed to slowly disappear as the object bagan to fade in the last photos that I took. The UFO appeared to  be about the size of a large aircraft.
