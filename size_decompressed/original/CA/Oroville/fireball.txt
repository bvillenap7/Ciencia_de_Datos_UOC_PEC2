And the two lights would move, then stay still, then literally dissaper and reappear.  At some points the circle objects would look like two or more circles making sort of a shape and fly slower then they would go straight back into perfect circles again and fly off slow.  At one point the craft was visible it was metallic and had one light flashing white for a little, then the craft looks like it shape shifted into green and purple lights then back to a diskish shape with the one white light and flew off and we lost it in sight, throughout the night lights were coming from all angles, aligning, communicating, in a weird way it seemed like.
