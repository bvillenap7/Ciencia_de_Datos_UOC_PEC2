I was outside my house at XXXX Ashley Ave. after dark when I saw two spheres approaching from the West going East.  I called my wife and she came out and saw them too. They were about 3 feet in diameter and less than 1000 feet in altitude. One was above the other and the lower one was in front. Their color was a very pale yellow and they glowed. Their speed was about three times as fast as a small single engine airplane. There was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
