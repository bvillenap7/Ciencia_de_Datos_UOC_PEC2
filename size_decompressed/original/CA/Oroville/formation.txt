There were four large wing-span aircraft.  They were flying In a  straight line eqidistance apart.  They had flashing red and white lights.  I could hear the faint rumble of an engine, but they didn't seem that high up because the lights were so visible.  They weren't moving that fast.   I thought it odd they were in such a straight line, so close together in jet stream of each other and moving slowly.  They appeared to be coming from the South going north.  I figured they possibly could be coming from Beale AFB.  It just appeared strange being in formation like that, as well.;39.544525;-121.50135
