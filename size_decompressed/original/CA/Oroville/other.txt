((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-25 05:00:00;3 minutes;Just before sunrise on the morning of the 25th of November 2019 I was sitting in my hot tub with three other friends at my property near bald rock in berry creek California and we were observing satellites and discussing them when we saw what looked like four satellites very close to each other moving from the west to towards the east. They were in a staggered line formation, all traveling the same speed and direction, approximately the same speed a satellite moves, but a bit slower, and at first we thought they were satellites on a similar orbit. As the objects passed from our far left to far right field of vision we began seeing more and more of these objects essentially moving in a staggered line formation and stretching for well over a mile. It took at least three minutes for them to all pass to the far right of our field of view and out of sight. There were several triangle formations within this staggered line but it appeared they were three separate o! bjects, not on me triangular shaped object. There was no sound and no bright lights. Just a steady line of these dots that were unambiguously remarkable. The sky was completely clear and there were no clouds. After approx two minuites of watching I ran to get another friend who confirmed what we were seeing as he was still able to see about ten of these objects in the last minute or so that they were visible so that makes five witnesses total. . I have seen many strange things out in the mountains where I live because there is very little light pollution but this was single handed lay the most incredible thing Iâ€™ve ever seen.;39.544525;-121.50135
