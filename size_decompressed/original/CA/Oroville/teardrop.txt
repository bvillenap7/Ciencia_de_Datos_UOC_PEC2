Object seen in Kelly Ridge;2006-01-24 23:15:00;45 seconds;Object seen in Kelly Ridge It was right about 11:15 pm when i went out onto my front steps to have a smoke. Moments after I sat down on my stoop I noticed a faint shimmer of light at about a forty-five degree angle from the horizon immediatly infront of my position. After focusing directly on the object i realized that it was not a star or satelite. I sat staring for probably thirty seconds when i actually realized what i was seeing. I stood up and as I did a second craft came into my field of vision and literally chased the first object away. It seemed like where the first object was located was less than a mile from my house. It also seemed like something fell off of both the first and second objects, possibly landing in the golf course in my neighborhood.I then stood for a few minutes, finished my smoke, then went inside.;39.544525;-121.50135
