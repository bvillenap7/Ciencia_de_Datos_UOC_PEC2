Silent aerial object seen in photo but NOT at the time.;2013-07-17 14:30:00;don't know;silent aerial object seen in photo but NOT at the time To Whom It May Concern: This afternoon I had driven to the Campus of Butte College to check out the Art center and measure time and distance for me to drive as I am contemplating taking classes there.  I wanted to send photos to my friends so I had my digital camera with me and did just that. I wanted to get the idea of the surrounding countryside as it is so beautiful so took some shots of the surrounding hills and trees as well as of the buildings on campus. 	As I left parking lot 3C, @ 14:27, I took this photo facing, at a guess, approximately WNW to show the hills and trees. I did not notice anything unusual at this time.  I arrived home and up-loaded the photos to my computer so I could send them to my friends and saw, for the first time, something in the sky above the far hills.  I had seen and heard nothing at the time. 	I want to assure you that this is not a hoax, as I take this stuff very seriously but just hoped that someone might be able to look more closely at the photo and figure out if it was an aberration of some kind.  Thank you for your attention,;39.544525;-121.50135
