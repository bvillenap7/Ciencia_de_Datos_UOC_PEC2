Blue Light in Garden Grove;2010-10-10 22:30:00;2 hours;Blue Light in Garden Grove Was going north bound on Harbor Blvd., passing Garden Grove Blvd. and saw blue lights in the sky... proceed north on Bruno Street off Harbor Blvd and turn right on Chapman Ave west of Harbor Blvd... got out of my car and saw this ufo with blue lights going on and off and moving at high rate of speed with no sound coming from the craft... there was a black unmarked helicopter chasing the craft but could not catch up to it... I did call 911 to report the sighting but they said that there where already handling it...there where several witness, on foot and cars some with video cameras filming it...and it did stop traffic dead in it tracks... I observed it for at lease 20 to 30 minutes and my friends really got scared of it so I left to take them home and came back to the scene where by that time the craft was already gone and from what the witness said that the ufo drop something which fell in a hotel parking lot and Garden Grove Police intercept it... and took! something in a unmarked police vehicle.... they already tried to make a cover story about it saying it was a fly home made air plane but it was not the case... the ufo I saw was at least 2 helicopters in size and huge... and no way it was man made... the flying rotation was not producible by man made technology and the bright blue lights where not from here... really no way ... and several witnesses say this event unfold...;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
