Seen jus;1993-10-15 18:00:00;15 minutes;SUMMARY:  A HUGE black retangular object. At least twice as big as a blimp even with it being about twice as high in the air. No lights. Seen just after sunset DIRECTLY OVER my house. It  moved slowly until it disappeared into the dark sky. It was almost dark when I saw it. If I had walked out just 15 minutes later, I would not have seen it. The object itself was totally black. No lights. I thought I might have seen four round circular objects on the underside as it passed over us but I can't be sure because it was so dark already.  It was huge and passed almost directly overhead. This was either three or four years ago.  I called my father to come outside and he did. My father and I are both business owners. My Dad didn't believe in UFO's before but he does now. I have always been interested in them.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081

It flew at about 2 mph, as I ended up walking right by it.  It was a black rectangle with a uneven dome on it in the middle.  It had small panels on its ends that were angled straight down.  At no time the object made sound.  It flew ahead of me crossing a main street where the field continued across the street.  I saw it until it disappeared from haze and/or fog in the field.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081

The store was just across from my apt across the street so we walked and crossed the street almost to the store when suddenly a light went on.my first thought was that a plane was going to crash but all of sudden the light turned off and I see the craft.it stopped say a couple stories up, like 10 stories.  when the light turned off I see a rectangle black object. to me it looked like a building.well like couple sec later a sliding door opened to the left in the middle of the object.to me it  looked like a door.when this sliding door opened the inside was black,it looked dark inside suddenly smoke came out from the door filling the sky with some kind of  smoke.when the smoke came out.all of a sudden like the movies I see the craft leaving at a fast speed that I just seen it like a star zooming to the sky and ! boom just a flick.till this day I know I seen it but dont believe I seen it.when this happened I seen a car stopped and was looking at what we were seeing. I told my cousin after we seen a ufo.hes like 10 years older.so he didnt believed me and said yea yea.but me and my friend know what we saw.now that im getting older I havent seen my friend and wonder what was that that we seen????
