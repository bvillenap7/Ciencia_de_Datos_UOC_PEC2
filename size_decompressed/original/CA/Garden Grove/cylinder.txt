Medium-sized white cylinder follows aircraft and departs over Garden Grove.;2007-03-03 12:00:00;3 min.;Medium-sized white cylinder follows aircraft and departs over Garden Grove. I was in my backyard observing the thick cirrus cloud cover when I saw a low airliner travelling westward leaving a persistent contrail.  Along side the aircraft was a small white object that I can only describe as a cylinder.  It continued to move with the aircraft, and then went on its own path moving southwest.  It continued to move in that direction until it began to slow down very fast.  It was hovering in one spot for about a minute.  During this time I went to retrieve my camera, but when I came back the object was not there.   I scanned the sky hoping to find it but to no avail.  The object during the whole account was at an altitude of about 15,000 feet. It had a long and rounded shape with a line down the center.  It was probably about 30 feet from one end to the other.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
Glowing Sphere Over Garden Grove, CA.;2018-03-30 21:00:00;5 minutes;Glowing Sphere Over Garden Grove, CA. The incident occurred on 3/30/18.  I was lying on my couch facing the large windows (which face west) in our living room (curtains were open).  It was after 8:30pm.  I saw a glowing orb in the night sky.  I had seen the full moon that night but I knew it was on the other side of the house.  Still, I thought, “That’s not the moon is it?” and went up to the window for a better look.  I’m skeptical of UFO sightings but had to take a closer look. I ran outside.  There were some wispy clouds in the east but in the west the night sky was perfectly clear.  There were big trees in the way so I walked onto the sidewalk and saw a dirigible shaped aircraft that was completely glowing or lit up.  The entire thing was lit up or glowing, much like the moon.  In the low center of the aircraft, off to the right, was a blinking red light.  The craft was flying low (although well above the trees) and traveling at a steady pace and headed north.  I saw no exhaust or smoke. I walked up the street and followed it for a bit wishing I had my camera.  I was completely sober.  I had just come back from a Good Friday program at my church.  At the closest range it was probably a little smaller than the size of my palm if held up away from me.  It seemed to be going away from me so was probably on a northwest course.  As I followed it I thought, “It’s probably a dirigible.”  But I’ve never seen anything like it. The blinking red light has made me think it’s something from earth, since that’s what all of our airplanes have on them.  But I’ve never seen anything like it.  Of course, I had never seen a stealth fighter before I actually saw one.  But why would the government make something that glows?;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081

It was about 100 yards from me, and about 65 feet high. When it went behind a cat wash sign it did not reappear from the other side of the sign.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
