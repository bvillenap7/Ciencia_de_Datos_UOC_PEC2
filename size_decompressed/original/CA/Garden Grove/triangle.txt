Triangle shape, broken into three discoid or round objects, shinny like polished stainless;2009-10-16 13:00:00;a few minutes;Triangle shape, broken into three discoid or round objects, shinny like polished stainless It appeared like a single triangle shape at first, but then it broke out into three objects separated by what appeared like the length of half a football field between them.  Try to take pictures but the objects would not show on pictures taken with digital camera, and then try to take video but objects would not appear on played video afterwards.  Objects disappeared into sky a bit later after taking video.  The objects where shinny but did not see any signs of a contrail so I am sure it was not a conventional craft.
