Some kind of evil looking airplane?;1989-06-01 00:00:00;30 seconds;Some kind of evil looking airplane? It was around 10 PM as Marathon restaurant was closing.  Living about a 1/4 mile from the restaurant I was entering a fence opening which served as a shortcut home.  When I looked back and up I saw a small white light high in the sky.  The light came down over the center of the street (a main street), as then I saw a black 20' long airplane.  Its wings were angled back, and on the backs of the wings were semi-circles.  Both wings had 4 or 5 semi-circles which communicated to me that it was evil.  The tail wings were ordinary airplane wings.  When it got about 20' over the middle of the street it sharply pulled up.  It then flew upward at an angle into outer space disappearing.  There was no sound.  No light was seen when it got close to the ground.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081

When it stopped it made very fast pendulum type movements.  It looked like a 4'in diameter multi-colored ball with a 6' multi-colored stick coming up from the center of it.  In 3 seconds it flung out upward, and disappeared into outer space.  I never heard a sound.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
Christmas type UFO;1994-06-01 00:00:00;10 secs;Christmas type UFO It was around 11:00 PM when I just closed my eyes to sleep.  In about 5 seconds after closing my eyes I decided to roll over.  As I was rolling over I saw over my carports an object traveling eastward at about 1 mph.  It was about 10 feet high, and looked like an outline of a concoction of boxes.  It had different colored blinking Xmas tree type lights on each of its corners.  In the center of it was a cross in an acrylic type glass.  I could see light inside.  I had a strong sense that somebody was mad inside, but not at me.  The object made no sound.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081

In the distance at about 600 yards I saw what I first thought was a jet then I thought it was a comet.  It slowly traveled along at about 10 mph when it turned upward and completely disappeared into outer space, as its 20 foot tail followed.  It was all a bright white.  7 seconds later an object showed up in one second, as it stopped and hovered.  It looked like a beautiful precious multi-colored stone, and was about a quarter of an inch in diameter.  In 3 seconds it disappeared in part of second about where the comet object did.  Three days later, at about the same time of day, I was walking home from the library.  As I was crossing a field, as a shortcut home I saw it again.  Only this time it filled one-eighth of the sky in the north.  It was about 120 feet high and traveling at about 10 mph westward.  In about 10 seconds it turned upward, and disappeared into outer space, as its vaporous tail followed with it.  Since then I saw this object in my area 4 or 5 times at about 6,000 feet altitude.  I could not mistake them for jets.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
It disappeared in part of a second;1996-12-10 21:00:00;2 minutes;It disappeared in part of a second Coming home from a local restaurant I saw as I walked a low bright light coming down my street.  As I walked through an apartment complex, at night, I lost sight of the light at times.  When I walked to my street sidewalk the light stopped 8 to 9 yards from me.  The light was 2 high beam car headlights on the front of a 16' in diameter round object.  It hovered about 14 feet from the ground over a pre-school playground.  It had a stack in the center made of sectioned or paneled bubble glass.  No light could be seen in the stack.  The car headlights were the only light, and were about 4 apart.  I observed it transfixed from the sidewalk for about 2 minutes when it budged a foot then in a part of a second disappeared northward.  Only the tracer from the car high beam headlights let me know the direction it went.  The tracer was open on the bottom, and closed on the top.  It made a slight upward angle.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
