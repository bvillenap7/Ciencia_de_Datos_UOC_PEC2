Flying oval shap object w/ bright white lights underneath;2006-03-01 19:45:00;3 min;Flying oval shap object w/ bright white lights underneath We were going North on Beach Blvd when we saw this object with very bright white lights in the air. We kept looking at it because it didn't look like a plane. It stayed in the mid air and got really close when we turned onto Garden Grove. It was definitely not a plane or a blimp. Anyone else saw it on that day?;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
