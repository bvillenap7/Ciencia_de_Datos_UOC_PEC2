4 individual ligths separate from main body, disperse then reunite and are retrived by main body;1991-03-08 19:00:00;1 hour;4 individual ligths separate from main body, disperse then reunite and are retrived by main body On the evening of March 8, 1991 at approximately 7pm, my wife and I were on the Garden Grove Freeway, headed west towards home. I remember that date and time exactly because that is my birthday and we were headed to our home for a “surprise” party. We noticed a very low flying bright “diamond shaped” light, flying just above tree level alongside the freeway. It was headed east bound as we were west bound. It was only approximately 100 feet up. At first we thought it was a helicopter because of the slow flight. We rolled down our windows to see and hear it better and we heard absolutely nothing. We then pulled off onto the side of the freeway, got out of our car and watched it. Usually even against a very dark sky, you can make out the outline of a helicopter or whatever, but we could make out NOTHING of any shape other than the diamond-shaped light.  Suddenly, it “dropped” four different lighted objects…I first thought they were flares, but after dropping approx. 10-15 feet, each of the smaller “lights” took off in level flight in 4 different directions. We were stunned. We jumped in our car and followed the closest one, which was headed west, which was towards the Long Beach Naval Station. We drove to a high point, at a Mall, where we got out of our car and watched. From this vantage point we were able to track and see all four of the “lights” in the distance. In the meantime, after dropping the 4 “lights”, the main diamond-shaped light turned and headed slowly north/northeast,  in the direction of Anaheim.  After about 15-20 minutes, the 4 lights started heading N/NE back towards the main light. We again jumped in our car and followed as quickly as we could towards Anaheim. We then actually saw each of the individual 4 lights arrive at the main “diamond-shaped” light and slowly rise up into the “light” After all 4 were retrieved, the main diamond-shaped light took off at considerable speed to the north where we lost sight of it.  I do NOT believe in “little green men”. We checked the papers the next day and saw no other reports of this sighting, which is mind-boggling because of its location, and the duration of the incident. I am now a retired physician living in Las Vegas and have never seen anything like it since. To me, the most unusual aspect was that no shape was distinguishable against the night sky other than the diamond-shaped light;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
Observed high altitude single white light traveling from south to north over Orange County, California;2000-12-29 16:10:00;5-7 min;Observed high altitude single white light traveling from south to north over Orange County, California My wife and I were visiting friends in Garden Grove and stepped outside to have a cigarette. I usually take a look at the sky, because our friends have a spectacular view unobstructed by trees. Looking above the constellation of Orion to the east, We noticed a single white light at high ltitude traveling from South to North in the conselation immediately above Orion (which was just starting to rise) at an etimated elevation (Azimuth?) of 60 degrees from the horizon. The light was steady white as it traversed in a nearly straight line until it faded out of sight to the north after about five minutes of observation. There were no observable navigation lights. It may be a satellite, however the object seemed to make a gradual 10 degree course change to the right (east) as it passed over Orange County. The estimated flight path would have crossed the LAX landing pattern at approximately 16:12 hours and there were aircraft in the pattern. I am a 42 year old public relations manager and my wife is in 43 year old software salesperson. Before we made the report, I checked Heaven's Above to confirm any prediction of satellite or Iridium flare activity, however I found nothing conclusive scheduled at that time for my area.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
On Nov. 02, 2005 at 5:30 pm, my family and I witnessed a strange display of lights over the city....;2005-11-02 17:30:00;30 minutes;On Nov. 02, 2005 at 5:30 pm, my family and I witnessed a strange display of lights over the city.... I was driving east to pick up my son from kids club when I noticed what I thought looked like lights from an airplane or chopper flying towards me when all of a sudden the lights in the sky swooped down very quickly then went up again then side to side spiralled in all directions.  The lights were so vivid and close but I could not see the shape of the object only say the lights associated with it.  I pulled the car over to get a better look, me and my four year old daughter were in ahh just looking at the lights as they danced in the sky.  I was trying to make sense of the what we were looking at thinking maybe it was a kite with lights on it, but it was moving to fast and covered so much distance and there was no fluttering noises like kites make.   Then I thought maybe it was a remote control airplane, but there were no engine sounds.   When the object would descend and climb it would strobe 4-6 lights in front of it and when it would spiral it would only have 2 red lights at the tips of the craft.   My daughter and I watched the lights/object in the sky for about five minutes till it disappeared.  Then I picked up my son a few minutes later at kids club and started telling him what we saw and where in the sky.   Then my son spotted the lights in the sky and so we watched the lights in the sky while in the car driving east on Chapman Avenue we stopped at the red waiting to make a left (north) on Knott avenue, that's when we noticed the second craft in the sky with the same exact characteristics as the first one and we watched the two(2) objects flying in the sky flashing their lights and spiralling in all directions.  That's when the signal light turned green and I raced down the street to pick up my wife from work and I got to her worked I parked in front and honked like a mad man telling her to hurry and get in the car so I can show her the lights in the sky so I raced around the office buildings to the back where there was a clear view of the sky but when we parked we only saw one of the objects about 3-5 miles south east but she was able to see the objects lights and its extraordinary maneuvering capabilities.   We watched the objects for approximately 2-3 minutes till we lost sight of it.   The whole sequence lasted about 30 minutes from 5:30 pm till 6 pm.   Please note, it was already dark outside since we had turned the clocks back on Sun. 10/30/05.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
Unusually large star catch's my baby's attention..;2006-12-18 20:00:00;minutes;Unusually large star catch's my baby's attention.. Sitting on the patio with my son, who just turned 2, when he pointed to the sky (southwest towards the coast) and said light. The word (light or lights) is one of the very few words in his limited vocabulary and could mean a wide variety of things. Not expecting much I looked up and saw what appeared to be an unusualy large star or planet. The stars larger than average size, unusual brightness and semi-sqared shape really got my attention. It also appeared to have several smaller lights ringing or dotting it's parimeter. As for movement, it looked mostly stationary, like an airliner does when flying twards you on decent from medium altitude. Not a very dramatic sighting for sure, but I'm sure curious as to whether anyone else noticed this, or was it just some normal celestial occurance. Note that it was bright enough and unusual enough for my toddler to take notice.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081

My mother stated look up in the sky, my father and I looked up and we saw a bright turquoise colored light, it at first looked as if like a missile going up at an angle into the sky very slowly, but then appeared quickly to be horizontal. It appeared as if 2 sets of lights one on top of the other, the light/ object moved to the right and then quickly back to the left and then again to the right. The light faded on one side and then completely disappeared. The sky was partly cloudy and the movement appeared as if behind a cloud part of the time, but you could still see the bright light.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081

It was about 9:30 Pacific time and i was about to do my usual sit up routine before going out for my saturday evening. It sprinkled rain for a few minutes that evening and made the sky very clear with partial clouds.I was lying on my back staring at a 747 probably landing towards the long beach airport. Suddenly from the right side of my vision, i noticed two bright objects, extremely high up in altitude flying extremely fast side by side, then crossing each other as if they were flying some sort of formation, but almost as if the objects were playing, very organized. The objects were definetely not shooting stars or comets. The objects flew in a playful organized pattern across the sky at extrodonary speed. the way the objects criss crossed and exchanged paths was so amazing to see,lasted for 3-4 seconds,flying into in the distance.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081

I would also like to add that we could hear rumbling almost like a train in the distance would sound that would come and go, it would even at times get so creep-ily silent..  I've lived in this house for almost 26 years, this was definitely NOT normal;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081

Strange White Light - Orb With Surrounding and Later Trailing White Veil;2018-02-06 18:30:00;5-7 minutes;Strange White Light - Orb With Surrounding and Later Trailing White Veil 6 February 2018 starting at approximately 6:25 ending 6:33 PM PST Garden Grove, CA., Approx. 33.796N,  117.963W  At approximately 18:30 PM PST, I was in the front yard of my parents' house in Garden Grove, CA.  It was an hour after sunset (17:28 PM) so the sky was dark.  There is a street light directly across the street plus an outside light that was on and the lights from inside.  From this position, close to the house and with those lights it was difficult to see any other objects in the sky or immediately determine the visibility conditions. I happened to look up over the roof of the house towards the south-southwest and I noticed a light which was brighter in the center and spread out to the sides.  It looked similar to moonlight shining through clouds.  My best guess at its exact initial azimuth position would be about 195-205 degrees and about 40-45 degrees above the horizon.   I didn't think it unusual at first and pay much attention to it since I wanted to finish working as quickly as possible.  A few minutes later I noticed that it was still in the same location.  Still I didn't think it unusual and without thinking it through assumed it to be the crescent moon or the planet Venus behind some haze or a thin layer of clouds.  Those are the only two objects that could be bright enough to shine through haze or light clouds anywhere near that part of the sky.  After a few more minutes of it being there I wanted a better look.  I walked around to the west side of the house.  The light was still in about the same part of the sky. This is when it really grabbed my attention since I better seeing conditions in a darker area.I was facing directly  south and realized that it wasn't the Moon  behind a cloud or haze.  It wasn't Venus either which is never in that part of the night sky.  I'm a long time amateur astronomer (40 years) and  know my way around the night sky well.  At times, Venus can be over 40 degrees above the horizon after sunset.  But it is never in that part of the sky where this light was.  The Moon is excluded also.  It was a week past full moon and now in the waning phase. Moonrise didn't occur until 00:09 the next day.  So what was it?  On my phone, I pulled up heavens-above.com sky chart for the current sky to see if somehow I had forgotten a bright star in that area.  This took a total of about 2 minutes.  That part of the sky, contains the constellation Eridanus which has no bright stars.  When I looked up again, the light had moved towards the south and was continuing to do so.  It was now about 20 degrees to the right of  Rigel, (0.18 mag.) the brightest star in Orion, and about its same distance above the horizon.  At that time Rigel was 42 degrees above the horizon.  The light was now clearly moving  but not what I would have called rapidly.  It had a white veil or a mist trailing it that covered 2-3 degrees.  It looked very much like what some call an orb and the veil trailing it much like that of a rocket's exhaust backlit by the sun as it ignites the 2nd stage. I knocked on the glass door but didn't see my parents.  I walked away from the back of the house into the backyard for a better look.  It was dark enough there to see other stars and only then was I able to see  that the sky was clear with excellent visibility.  The wind was calm.  The light continued moving slowly in SSE direction with the white veil trailing it at about the speed of a commercial jet nearing  cruising altitude.  I know that the size, altitude and speed of an object are difficult to determine against an open sky with no objects for comparison.  I won't attempt to do that here.  I recorded some video with my phone but by then it was too dim to show up.
