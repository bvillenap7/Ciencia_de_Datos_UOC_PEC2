Lazer like fire from staionary objects in sky!;1991-05-01 14:00:00;45min+;Lazer like fire from staionary objects in sky! I have had 3 sightings to date Peter this is my first one.Sorry it took so long though please know I have shared my sightings with other groups. In 1990 I was co-managing a hotel in Garden grove ,Cal. It was a gloomy day in southern Cal. with low clouds and drizzle when in the mid afternoon I heard strange sounding thunder and lighting. I went outside amd thats when I saw it! I can't be exactly sure on the amount because it happened over 10 years ago but I believe there were 9 ,I saw nine glowing balls of light in the clouds. They were all in a gemomectric pattern equally spaced apart from each other. When a type of thunder sounded off these objects would begin to grow and get brighter. They also produced this strange loud electrical  sound like a buzzing that would keep getting louder untill one ball kind of exploded. When this happened the ball that exploded sent a lazer like line of electricity at one of the other nine,that one would then do the same with perhaps one opposite it .This continued in a pin ball like fashion as all balls got hit with this lazer thing. Everytime one would recieve it's hit it grew in size and brightness.The balls fired the lazers so fast back and forth at each other it was hard to follow. When the thunder stopped or slowed so did light showthough it would start the next series of zaps 30 seconds or more later. They seemed to generate their own energy after the initial kick start from the clouds. These balls never moved and them being in the clouds I never saw any more then bright glowing round lights in the low clouds. I went inside our hotel and got my co-worker who was Chinese to see this for him self. On seeing the balls in the sky he ran back inside and tried to pull me in to. this is very bad you must get in I thought maybe he saw something like this in China so I asked him what it was but of course he had no idea. I have researched many UFO books and have well surfed the internet and have found only two sighting that were a bit similar though not the same.This was very hard to put on paper ,you must have been there to understand how strange yet powerfull it all seemed. A ufo fight? A dimention opening up? A star wars experiment(over a hotel?) ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

We saw a bright white light that was hovering.;2006-02-09 18:30:00;15 Seconds;We saw a bright white light that was hovering. Me and my family were driving on beach blvd. in garden grove, Ca when i looked out the widow and saw a bright white light that was stoped in mid air.  I thought it was a helicopter but then when we were turning down the next street we stopped at the light first and i noticed that it moved closer to us. Then as i watched it went to the south realy fast and stopped and imploded on it self.  I know for a fact that it was not a helicopter or a strobe light on an airplane or something.  This thing was only about 200 feet off of the ground.  Please tell me what you think it was.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
I witnessed to UFO's collide;2010-09-01 06:45:00;10 seconds;I witnessed to UFO's collide I was driving to work and saw to my left through the windshield what looked like 2 large stars.  The sun was just coming up but it was light out and normally stars could not be seen at that time. The one star on the left was stationary.  The one on the right was speeding towards it incredibly fast.  There was an explosion and then nothing could be seen.  When I got to work I checked online, checked the news radio programs but nothing was reported.  There were lots of people on the road and I know I couldn't have been the only one to see this.  It still haunts me.  Nothing could move that fast.  Then no debris, no sound? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
