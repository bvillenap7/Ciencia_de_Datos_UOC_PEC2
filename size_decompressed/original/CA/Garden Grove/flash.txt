Flash of Blue Light;2008-02-06 21:30:00;2 sec;Flash of Blue Light I saw a flash of light.  It was too close to be a shooting star.  It left a thick trail light blue of light.  After it flew for a while across the sky, it seemed to have exploded.  Although it exploded, there was no fire, just a small poof of blue light which caused it to stop moving in its linear direction.  After it exploded it all disappeared really fast.  This was rather easy to see, despite the fact that I was around a main street where there were plenty bright lights.  I just want someone to explain to me what I saw.  It was in Garden Grove, CA (Orange County) at approximately 9:30 pm on 2/6/08 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
