Object moving at a high speed in full daylight observed by two witnesses.;2004-09-04 16:30:00;3-5 minutes;Object moving at a high speed in full daylight observed by two witnesses. Object was white or possibly silver, definitely metallic looking. Object appeared very high in the sky in full daylight, no clouds. Saw two planes pass underneath with a seemingly great distance between them. Object was moving from east to west at what seemed to be fast, erratic pace. Object left no visible trail. At first glance the object appears to be round, but after watching it move for about a minute or so, I thought that it could have been cylindrical shaped. Object was observed by myself and one other witness. I went inside to get binoculars, could not locate object when I returned.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
Looked like a star/satellite following a polar orbit, then changing directions.;2011-01-11 00:20:00;30 seconds;Looked like a star/satellite following a polar orbit, then changing directions. I was outside having a smoke looking up at the stars, as I do at least 5 times a night.  I saw what at first I thought was a satellite (which looks like a star moving extreamly fast across the night sky).  It was traveling across they sky at the same speed you see satellites cross the sky.  I was going straight north, so I thought it was in a polar orbit.  It was directly overhead when I first noticed it.  As it was moving North, once it hit about a 45 degree viewing angel, it made a perfect 90 degree right (East) turn while keeping speed.  It did not curve the turn like a jet, but made an exact cornet turn like following the corner of a square.   Then it went made another perfect right turn back South, then again back West.  And once it crossed it's original path, it mase a few curves around.  I don't really remember exactly it's path after that because I was in shock.  But it curved around a bit and ended up just a little East of it's original path, then back! South, and then I lost track of it.  It was a little foggy, so it was hard to see the stars.  You could only see two or three of the brightest stars, and this was a little brighter then the brightest star.

A green object was in the sky, moved at a high velocity, stopped, hovered, and moved in the opposite direction at a high velocity.;2014-02-07 20:54:00;~1 minute;A green object was in the sky, moved at a high velocity, stopped, hovered, and moved in the opposite direction at a high velocity. There was a green light with a smaller light right near it in the sky moving about 25 mph, then it sped up to about 100 mph to the right, then stopped, hovered for about 10 seconds, then moved to the left at about the same fast speed, then it stopped for a little duration, then disappeared.   I'm a firm believer of UFO's, and this is my second time seeing a similar object in the sky.  The first time was in Fountain Valley, CA.   My friend has a neutral background with UFO's.

a green round object running about the Moon, and then it hid behind the moon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flare??  PD));2015-09-27 22:40:00;14 seconds;Dear NUFORC,  On the night of 09/27/15, it was about 10:40 PM, I came out and watched the Moon.  I used my iPhone to tape the moon.  There was something around the moon, but I did not paid attendtion to that thing at that time.  Until in morning, I took a look at that video clip.   I was chilled by seeing a green round object running about the Moon, and then it hid behind the moon.  I shared this clip with my co-workers.  They all astonished.  We all had the same thoughts of Aients.  I was thinking and thinking about the clip, if I shuold share this video clip with experts or  NASA to analyze the video clip (the clip last for 14 seconds), if they can explain what is that object.   Finally I decided to search on line.  I found NUFORC.  I would like to share this with NUFORC.   Please advise.  Thank You;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
Individually each light appeared exactly like witnessing a satellite with the naked eye.  ((anonymous report));2016-06-18 22:32:00;60-90 seconds;-Individually each light appeared exactly like witnessing a satellite with the naked eye. -Brightness, speed, trajectory, distance, etc. was the same for each object and behaved exactly like a satellites. -iPhone compass showed a 221 degrees SW heading from West to South. -progression was 1light-followed by-1light-followed by-5to7lights(honeycomb shape)-followed by1light-followed by-1light. -I'm 43y.o. and don't use drugs, drink, or smoke cigarettes or weed. -I do stargaze a couple times every night for about 20 mins and have watched a hundred, if not more, satellites. -WOW!  Never have witnessed a cluster of lights moving in formation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
