Cigar shaped object;1979-06-01 00:00:00;40 seconds;I was at the Newport Beach getting on the Newport freeway from Newport Blvd.  Just as I was getting on the freeway, in a lot of traffic, I saw to my left ahead of me a 20' long cigar shaped object.  It was about 70 feet from me, and about 40 feet high.  It traveled northward at about 3 mph.  It had what looked like molten lava all over it.  It had no visible doors or windows.  When it flew to my far left trees obstructed my view of it that I permanently lost sight of it.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
