Orange in color diamond shaped lights seen in the sky hovering over garden grove.;2013-06-15 02:22:00;2-3 minutes;Orange in color diamond shaped lights seen in the sky hovering over garden grove. I was traveling east bound on Lampson Avenue passing Heather Street when I noticed what I first thought were airplanes coming in for landing at I assumed the Long Beach airport.  As I got closer it appeared to be in the shape of a diamond.  There were 4 lights that I saw. Picturing a diamond I seen one up towards the top two in the middle side by side and one towards the bottom.  At one point I saw the two middle lights kind of spin around each other like switch places.  The lights appeared to be orange in color.  As I approached the intersection of Manley & Lampson the lights were directly above me.  I proceeded to make a right turn (south) onto Manley street looked out my window and realized they were directly above me. I proceeded to the end of the street which was Stanford Avenue at which point I made a u turn and parked my car at the intersection of Manley Street and Lampson Avenue at which point I looked out my window and they were gone.  No where to be found, in the distance or otherwise. I posted a comment on my facebook page in which a friend of mine who lives near by indicated that her and her husband had seen the lights as well.  Except she recalls seeing 5 lights.;33.7861357142867;-117.931067922081
