gituar pick shaped object traveling north that was very thick and larger than the valley;2006-06-30 18:00:00;aprox 1 minute;gituar pick shaped object traveling north that was very thick and larger than the valley please dont take this as a hoax report. i swear on my life as a human being that this happened. i have one other witness out of myself and 2 friends. the third friend was drunk, and therefore called us crazy. we saw it. it happened. i dont know how else i can prove it to you other than saying this is a true story. myself and 2 friends were sitting in a field on the southern end of town. one friend looked up exclaiming about the huge object above us. i looked up and all i saw was a red dot moving approximately 100mph in a northern direction. as i kept looking at it i realized i could not see stars around the red light. as the object passed i noticed the sheer thickness of the craft. approximately 10-30 stories thick. as it passed overhead the stars appeared behind it. the back of the craft had 3 huge round engine looking things almost like the engines on the battle cruisers off of star wars. other than that it appeared to be flat on the bottom with what looked like windows on the sides. very small though due to the sheer size of the object. after it passed overhead it drew a warm breeze to the north on a nigh in which there was no wind at all. this is the first time ive seen an object that was larger in scale than the town or even the valley that i was in.  it traveled probably a mile overhead at the very most.  it was very low to the ground in comparison to the sheer size of the object.
