At this point the object was white and quite bright I used my binoculars and was able to see two dimmer flashing red lights on the object, at this point the object was traveling North away from me i continued to watch the object and approximently two minutes after heading north it got slightly dimmer (i could still see both the white constant lights and the flashing red lights)this is when the object appeared to split into two different objects, with one veering west-northwest, and the other heading more north but veering East. At this point i lost sight of the objects. There were a couple children and one adult neighbor who i believe may have seen the object. I want to say that this is a VERY BRIEF explanation of what i saw this evening. I would feel much better to be able to physically explain these events. I know what i saw, and i have never seen anything like this before. The object did not appear to change speed, it was not moving fast at all which made observing this object unusual, i tried to photogragh it with my camera in my cellphone, but it was to dark (i still have 1 photo stored in phone) I hope that i can explain this experience to someone who can transcribe it. I believe what i saw, a just don't know how to write it. I am willing to talk to someone who is willing to do this. I want to follow through with this, I want to KNOW WHAT I SAW.............................THANX;39.1592;-123.1963
