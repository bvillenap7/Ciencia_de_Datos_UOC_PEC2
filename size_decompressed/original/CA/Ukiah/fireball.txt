I saw a big white static fireball fall vertical from the sky, it fell fast and was glowing white.  The only sound I heard was a car or business alarm going off right before it fell.   It was fast and reminded me of a malfunctioning firework object, but 10x bigger.  It was 10:10 pm on Monday, June 12, 2017.    Two weeks ago I saw a red fireball fall at around the same time of night but it was a Sunday.  I reported that one to the meteor reporting sight.  Neither tonights or the one 2 weeks ago looked like a meteor or falling star.  I also have authentic photos of other activity, but I'm not reporting that.;39.1592;-123.1963
