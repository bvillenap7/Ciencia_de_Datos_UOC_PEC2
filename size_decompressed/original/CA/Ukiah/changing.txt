Seperating points of light;1977-08-28 21:50:00;1 minute;Seperating points of light This may seem really silly to you, but it's what I saw. I was very sceptical about this sort of thing but this convinced me. We were camping at a hunting reserve in Ukiah. We were all camped out in the middle of the night, looking at the stars, laying back in our sleeping bags. I was seventeen at the time and didn't care about anything but the blonde in the bag next to me. We watched a point of light go east to west high up in the sky. I thought it was a satillite we saw them all the time. This particular one cruised across the night, stopped dead cold, a second point of light seperated from it, went due east, and the first light sped off north and disappeared. The other light sped off east rapidly and disappeared over the horizen. I knew these two objects were not in the atmosphere. Go figure. Not much, I agree, but enough for me to look at things a bit different. Maybe other folks have seen something similiar I'd be curious to know. ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time may be approximate.  We have many reports on file that are similar to this one in several respects.  Satellites almost invariably do not orbit to the west, with only very few exceptions, e.g. the Soviet Molnya spacecraft.  PD));39.1592;-123.1963
