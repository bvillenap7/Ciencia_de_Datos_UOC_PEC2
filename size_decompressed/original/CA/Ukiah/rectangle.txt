High velocity craft flying parallel to freeway.;2007-01-29 05:50:00;3 seconds;High velocity craft flying parallel to freeway. While travelling South on US-101 at 5:50 AM, several miles north of Ukiah, CA, a small cluster of lights came swooping in at a shallow angle in the opposite direction in front of me, on the east side of the road.  It was moving faster than I would expect a plane to move, and at first I thought it must be a meteor.  As it sped by me, I could see that it was in fact some sort of craft. While on the approach, I could only see a few smallish cluster of bright lights, looking at it from behind, I could see a rectangular grid area strongly lit, most likely the propulsion system. As I continued to look at it in my rear view mirror, I saw that it quickly slowed down, and the rear grid greatly increased in brightness.  Soon after that it disappeard from view, probably around the side of the bank of the road. The craft couldn't have been more than 100 feet above the ground, more likely 50 feet.  After realizing that it wasn't a meteor, the next logical conclusion would be that it was a low flying aircraft, but it was moving quite fast, much faster than 100 miles an hour.  I was only able to see it for about three seconds, even though it was running parallel to the road.  Even though at its closest it couldn't have been more than 300 feet away, it never made even a glimmer of a sound.  However, my windows were up at the time. The lit rectangular grid region on the back of the craft was unusual, however, and I can't quite think of anything I've previously seen that would describe it.  Its flaring up as the craft quickly decelerated was also odd. It was moving so fast, and traveling so close to the ground, that the pilot must have been using night vision, or else have been extremely fool-hardy.;39.1592;-123.1963
