Bright-Star or Something Else!  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable star.  PD));2008-10-08 21:00:00;2 weeks;Bright-Star or Something Else! Last night I noticed a bright light flashing like a giant-star, above a mountain range and I mentioned it to my family, my husband & my son, for whom was in the car. They both saw it too & my son, also mentioned that his friend had seen the same thing for the last 3 days. Then, when I told my daughter the same story, she said that she also saw it for the last 2 week's. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable star.  PD));39.1592;-123.1963
Small lights that fly around in formation;2010-05-03 21:35:00;Current;Small lights that fly around in formation I live northern California.  My brother, his wife, and I have been seeing these lights in the sky.  The one light that sits above the mountain it mostly stays in one spot, ecept it dances around kind of like a firefly.  It will separate and then come back together. The other lights are about as big around as a baseball and they fly in formation.  There are a lot of these and we see them almost every night.;39.1592;-123.1963
Bright but silent slowly moving light with occasional red flash low in sky east of Ukiah, CA ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius?  PD));2011-09-18 22:00:00;2 + hours;Bright but silent slowly moving light with occasional red flash low in sky east of Ukiah, CA My husband and I were outside last night in the hot tub around ten pm, pst, and saw what looked like a bright star low in the sky east of Ukiah. As we watched it we noticed it was actually moving, sort of hovering, very slowly. We observed it for up to two hours slowly making its way west. I mean it was inching forward. Every now and then a tiny red light flashed behind it. If I didn't know any better I'd say it was a helicopter - we live under the flight path to our small, rural airport, but it moved so slowly and steadily that it didn't like a helicopter and we certainly didn't hear any helicopter sound. It was silent. After a few hours we went to sleep - it was till there. Would love to know what it was. We typically go for a quick soak every night and get used to seeing satellites and what not. This was different...it was too close to be a plane or satellite. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius?  PD));39.1592;-123.1963
Location of viewing southern Ukiah Valley, vineyards east of airport, south of ((deleted) Brewing Company. About midnight. Bright point;2014-06-17 00:00:00;1-2 minutes;Location of viewing southern Ukiah Valley, vineyards east of airport, south of ((deleted)) Brewing Company.  About midnight.  Bright point of light (not blinking) just above hills to the west and at first presumed to be a helicopter due to often seeing helicopters at that low elevation coming from the west.   Waited for it to continue on a horizontal path, seemingly towards the east or east/southeast, but that was not happening.   This point of light was about five times the magnitude of brightest stars and appeared to be rising up.  At first perhaps at a 45 degree angle.   Then that changed and it clearly was going up straight, steady and not too fast but it was getting dimmer and dimmer and obviously ascending straight into the atmosphere.  And, progressively dimmer and dimmer until it just disappeared.   It didn't shoot straight up like a dart it took about 15 to 20 seconds to disappear.  The dot of light easily seen getting dimmer and dimmer, and then just not there anymore.;39.1592;-123.1963
