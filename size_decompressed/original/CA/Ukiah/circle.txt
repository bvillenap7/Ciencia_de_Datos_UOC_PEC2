At least 6 large circular craft hovering in thin cloud cover move across the western sky.;2006-12-07 16:00:00;1-2 minutes;At least 6 large circular craft hovering in thin cloud cover move across the western sky. WHILE TRAVELING 1 MILE NORTH OF UKIAH, CALIFORNIA, 1000 FEET BEFORE THE NORTHBOUND LAKE MENDOCINO OFF-RAMP, LOOKING DUE WEST TOWARD THE SUN, THERE WAS A THIN LAYER OF CLOUDS MOVING TO THE EAST.   THE CLOUDS WERE NOT THICK OR SOLID, I LOOKED AT MY CAR CLOCK AND NOTICED THAT IT WAS 4:43 P.M.  I TURNED BACK TO CHECK OUT THE SUNSET ABOUT 2-3 MILES IN THE DISTANCE (APPROXIMATELY) AND NOTICED (3) THREE SHAPES COMING OUT OF THE CLOUD COVER, THE FIRST ONE WAS FULLY VISABLE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLY A HOT AIR BALLOON COMING OUT OF THE CLOUDS, BUT THEN IT BECOME FULLY EXPOSED AND I SAW IT WAS AN EXTREMELY LARGE CIRCULAR GRAY SHAPE WITH A MASSIVE DOME TOP, THE OTHER 2 WERE THEN EXPOSED AND I SAW THE THREE HUGE SHIPS JUST BEFORE THE CLOUDS CAME AROUND THEM AGAIN. INSTANTLY THEY SHOT ACROSS THE SKY TOWARD THE SUN AND THE COAST AT A SPEED THAT I CAN'T EVEN DISCRIBE. AS I SAT AND WATCHED, THERE APPEARED 3 MORE HUGE CIRCULAR SHAPES HOOVERING IN THE CLOUDS AND THEY ALSO SHOT RAPIDLY IN SUCCESSION TOWARD THE SUN, DUE WEST. THIS EVENT HAPPENED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.  I DID NOT NOTICE LIGHTS OF ANY KIND COMING FROM THE CRAFT.;39.1592;-123.1963
Big and very bright object flying low.;2016-07-27 22:00:00;40 seconds;Big and very bright object flying low. A very bright and big round object with colored sparkling lights and a tail of light flew over the hillside across from my house.  It was very low, not much over the tops of the trees.  It flew pretty much West to East and then turned South at the end of the ridge and disappeared from my sight. It flew at about the speed of a helicopter but was completely silent. My dog only noticed it when he saw it(no sound) and growled at it.;39.1592;-123.1963
