observed Angel Hair type UFO;2004-10-11 14:00:00;1 minute;observed Angel Hair type UFO On or about October 11, 2004 at 2 pm I noticed a UFO flying over head about 30,000 feet AGL above my avocado orchard. It was flying north at around 200 to 300 mph in a northerly direction which stayed in view for less than a minute. A 747 was flying near by, leaving a long contrail and heading south parallel to the UFO. The UFO didnâ€™t make any sound as it passed over. The UFO was round and bright and gleamed like the suns rays were bouncing off of it. As it flew over I could see that some type of white mass was protruding from all around the UFO in a clockwise position at a very slow spin compared to its speed. The UFO was too high to determine if it was shedding the white material or not. It was hard to believe what I saw until I got my October issue of UFO magazine a few days after the sighting. On page 63 Ann Druffel tells about Angel Hair and Fluorescence. This I believe is what I saw in the sky that day.
