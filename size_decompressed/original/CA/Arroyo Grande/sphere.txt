The sphere was heading south or southeast and disappeared into the sky or behind the hills.   It is hard to know how high or large or fast this object was but it did not resemble any object I have ever seen and was large enough and odd enough to make me stop driving and not want to go in the same direction it was traveling.  My three daughters who were with me also saw it.  I made several phone calls, trying to find out what it was and was sure many others would have seen it and that it would be on the news.  I was dismissed.  Probably they thought I was crazy.;35.1624333333333;-120.475716666667
