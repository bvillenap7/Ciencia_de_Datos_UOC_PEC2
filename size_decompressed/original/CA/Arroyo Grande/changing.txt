Round, colored lights in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of twinkling stars, we wonder.  PD));2015-11-30 22:00:00;1 hour;round clored lights in the sky Last night, at around 10pm, myself and one other member of my family witnessed numerous round objects in the sky that were filled with allumunating colered lights-blue-red-yellow.  The lights would twinkle on and off almost like watching a ferris wheel as the objects changed shape and form.   The objects were to big to be stars and were amazing to look at with binoculars.   There were also displays of  whited lights shooting through the clouds and then just disappearing. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of twinkling stars, we wonder.
