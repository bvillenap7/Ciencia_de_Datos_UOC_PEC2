3 disks flying silently at high speeds, stopped to hover, then climbed out of the atmosphere.;1998-03-27 22:35:00;5min;3 disks flying silently at high speeds, stopped to hover, then climbed out of the atmosphere. my friend and i were on the swings during recess at our school.  We had been friends for a few years.  We looked up at the sky. the day was sunny, with several small clouds in the area.  we then saw what seemed to be a small black blob aproaching us at a high speed.  as it got closer we saw that there were three suacer shaped craft.  they were black with a red circle in the middle with a red ring around that.  they hovered for several seconds silently.  there were no contrails or any indication of the signs of an internal combustion engine.  they began to climb slowly at first but then getting faster and faster until we could not see them anymore.  they had clearly gone out of the atmosphere.
