We always meet in a secluded side road off the 101 Freeway and Los Berros Road off ramp.  There are very few lights in this area so I told my grandson we should get out of the car to look at all the stars since it was so dark out.  As we looked up into the sky there was a string of lights traveling fast in a NW direction.  I quickly tried to count them and there must have been over 20 lights.  All in a straight row evenly spaced going across the sky.  I tried to grab a video with my very out-dated phone, but NOTHING should up when I played it back.  The straight string of lights looked like a row of cars that were traveling on a one lane highway equally spaced apart traveling at a high rate of speed.  No sound at all.  My grandson said, That's weird and I agreed.  I am a 69 year old woman and I do not drink or take any drugs and I have never seen anything like that!;35.1624333333333;-120.475716666667
