I called my friend told her what i  had seen and she was amazed of my story .  The very next evening same time it came back and she took three pictures. it was no more than 2000 ft. above us . It sounded like thunder as it flew by.  Completely illuminated must have been  the size of a football field or bigger. I was astounded by this , but what really blew our minds was the structure on top of the triangle.  It was emmense perhaps a mile in length . so much detail to explain but our questions have been answered about where the orbs are coming from .   We have pictures of orbs docking on this  aircraft carrier. some one must contact us  immediately.  We have answers ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Possible hoax.  PD));35.1624333333333;-120.475716666667
