lights in the sky.;2001-08-20 20:00:00;about 15 mins;lights in the sky. Ok  another wierd light lastnight.if anyone saw this just after 8 let me know or someone help me out  this was wierd lastnight.i was waiting for a friend looking at bats fly in the sky and the first stars come out.A light moving in a south east motion was going acros the sky. I know it wasnt an airplane but i really thought it to be a satelite.I watch it go across the horizon untill it disapairs.Then about 3 minuets after that another one catches my eye,going same direction,same pace, just a light moving acros the sky.I thought wierd i never really seen satelites like that.At this time in not really hiped up about seeing all that because i think it could have been satelites.i was more mad because ive been waiting for like 15 20 mins outside.So i pace around look at more bats in the sky looking north.Then a blue comet type fireball thats seemed to skip on water buzzed by,not super bright but it was wierd,a blue fireball type thing.i thought wow  thats really wierd,maybe im tired.But that had all my attention on the sky.Now not even a minute after i see that fireball another light goes racing acros the sky,much faster than the sattelites but same direction,exept this on was pulsating bright to very faint,that made me run in and get my cousin,she came out and looked at it to for about the last 30 seconds we could see it int he sky.My cousin even said wow that was pretty wierd and as were looking up another faint light goes in a north west direction,pulsating also but still staying pretty faint.that one was going real slow also i saw it for about 4 minuets buzz its way over the ocean.after that i didnt see anything and my cousin went inside because it was getting chilly.Also my frined came by.I hope someone here in South San Luis Obispo county seen it or someone let me know what all these strange lights are.i belive in UFO's and have been seeing alot here. Thank u for reading and giving your time.;35.1624333333333;-120.475716666667

Looking up i noticed a really bright star and it was moving to a south west motion really slow.  It faded from really bright to  bareley noticable as it traveled for at least 10 seconds.  Then it just went in a really quik zip from south east to a north west motion and disapeared.  Me and my friend both  saw it,we  talked for a few and figured we would go deal with the rest of the night.then when i got picked up at 11 pm to go home  me and my other friend saw a wierd red blinging light doing all kinds of manuevers.ive seen wierd lights here before  and i saw another 2.;35.1624333333333;-120.475716666667
Mysterious light observed near Vandenberg AFB;2007-02-23 09:30:00;3-4 minutes;Mysterious light observed near Vandenberg AFB My co-worker and I were southbound on the 101 and we both noticed a shimmer of light approximately 30 degrees off of the southern horizon.  Neither of us responded, believing it to be a reflection of a distant aircraft.  Until it grew in intensity and it changed its shape now an elongated diamond-shape. This 'flare' lasted about 15 seconds and gradually faded, the entire time holding its position.  After 3 minutes the light abruptly dropped about 10 degrees downward and slowly fade out. The interesting thing was that we knew our heading and we knew that due south, precisely where this mysterious light shone, is Vandenberg Air Force Base.;35.1624333333333;-120.475716666667
Two bluish-green lights moving NNE over Arroyo Grande, CA at unbelievable speed.;2010-01-18 20:55:00;milisec;Two bluish-green lights moving NNE over Arroyo Grande, CA at unbelievable speed. On January 18, 2010, over Arroyo Grande, CA at 8:55 PM my assistant and I watched two lights flying eastward, approximately NNE. Both lights were bright and bluish-green. One light was three times as wide as a “falling star” the other light was a pinpoint, but completely observable. No sound. The smaller light was below and to the left of the large light and remained in the same position as they moved. The large light left a trail from almost overhead (when first observed) to disappearance. The small light left no real trail. They covered the distance from overhead to horizon (disappearance) in, say, less than 1/10th of a second. The disappearance judged to be two hand widths high. The sky was clear stars clearly seen. Both witnesses are adults. The lights were too blue and too fast to be from my planet.;35.1624333333333;-120.475716666667
Bright light spiraled away after 15 minute dance.;2014-03-19 18:00:00;15 minutes;Bright light spiraled away after 15 minute dance. Noticed a bright glowing light approx. east and 80 degrees upwards of home.  Observed the light split into two and stay in close proximity of each other.   Used binoculars and watched as light(s) appeared to revolve/circle around each other in a spiral and occasionally cross over/into each other.   Constant orange light like booster rockets and stayed in same location but moving upwards and away.  Light grey shadow interlaced between both lights.  Called wife outside and she also observed for the event duration.;35.1624333333333;-120.475716666667
