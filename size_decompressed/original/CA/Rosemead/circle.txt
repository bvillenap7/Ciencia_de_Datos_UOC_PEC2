We have amended the date above.  The witness telephoned at the same time that we were receiving hoax telephone calls from a group of youth in the same area code, so we assumed that the witness was placing one of those calls.  When we finally spoke with the witness over the telephone, we realized our error.  We apologize to the witness for not taking him seriously initially.  We found him to be a credible witness, once we had listened to what he had to report.  There were many other reports from the same area of the red light.  We do not know what it was.
