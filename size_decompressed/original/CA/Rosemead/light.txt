Point of light streaks across the sky over Los Angeles;2020-12-21 17:30:00;5 seconds;Point of light streaks across the sky over Los Angeles I was doing some star gazing this evening when I noticed a high altitude light streak across the sky from East to West in a matter of seconds. At first I thought it was a meteor but it did not have the burn tail of the usual meteoroid hitting the atmosphere. This was a point of light like any other in the night sky racing across the sky.;34.0648000000001;-118.086
