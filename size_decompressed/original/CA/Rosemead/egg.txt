Oval, egg-shaped object seen above Rosemead, CA.;2012-06-19 16:15:00;1 minute;I was driving on 10 FWY towards Rosemead and notice a shiny shape of flying object.  Because of the reflection of the sun,  It appears to be an oval-egg shape object.   It was nearly impossible, but it disappears while I was driving to grasp my phone and take a photo of it. It just gone in a blink.;34.0648000000001;-118.086
