I saw a saucer-shaped UFO with multi-colored lights.;1998-09-20 22:20:00;1 minute;I saw a saucer-shaped UFO with multi-colored lights. I looked up at the stars during a party. Buecause I was far from all the lights, being night, i could see many stars. I looked at Orion and I saw the UFO. to envision it, take a submirine conning tower and place it on top of a disk. the edge of the disk had lights. I don't see colors corectly, but I percived yellow, red, and green. I showed it to my friend. it didn't move at all. We went to get his brother. when we came back, the UFO was gone. I can't estimate the size, but it appeared to be 1 centimeter long. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.0648000000001;-118.086
