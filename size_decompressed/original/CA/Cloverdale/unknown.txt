If I extended my arm and measured between thumb and forefinger they would be about one inch apart from each other moving in tandem and could not discern if it was one craft or not.  I called my wife out to see and by that time they had dimmed to the brightness of the other stars. We watched them go over head and to the back of us and they seemed to fade out when they reached about 70 degrees.  I did not notice any airplane noise during this event.;38.7943;-123.0039
