While walking in our neighborhood at dark we spotted lights in sky that appeared to be two planes/helicopters, or whatever, flying in such perfectly synchronized formation that the lights stayed equidistant apart (something along the line of blue angel accuracy.)  We realized after closer observance that it was one vehicle, not two.  It was hard to make out at first, but could see it was saucer/disk shaped and at a fairly low altitude moving slowly across the sky.  We guessed it was flying about the altitude a small plane would fly in our local area so we guessed it to be about the size of a football field across.  The light to the right went out, blinked, and then came on again after a second. and then flickered on and off again.  Then it turned westward while rotating around clockwise.  It then disappeared northward as it turned counterclockwise and moved over the mountain range and disappeared from our view.  (We deducted this because the light on the right side was above the other which made it seem to have turned that direction.);38.7943;-123.0039
