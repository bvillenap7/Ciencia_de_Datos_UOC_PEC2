Luminous egg see over The Geysers east of Cloverdale, CA;1983-06-15 00:15:00;45-60 seconds;Luminous egg see over The Geysers east of Cloverdale, CA At approximately 12:15am PST on June 15, 1983, my friend Paul P. and mysef were leaving a mutual friend's house and spotted a luminous egg shaped object slowly descending towards the eastern ridgeline. This would place the onbect roughly over The Geysers, a famous geothermal field run by Unocal Geothermal and PG&E (which was originally developed by my grandfather and his mercury mining associates, and curiously enough also where my father worked as production foreman). This object made no sound, was surrounded by a faint glwoing aura and left a glowing luminous train which gradually tapered off to nothing. Both Paul and myself stood on the front porch watching the object slwoly slip behind the ridgeline, as if it was coming in to make a nice, gentle landing. Once the object slipped from view, both of us seemed to snap out of our amazment induced shock and proceeded to verify that we had both seen the same thing. I have personally seen 14 UFOs in my life, 4 of which I cannot dismiss as some other phenomena. These 4 sightings, all of which were witnessed by at least one other person, all occurred in/near Cloverdale, CA. Perhaps the geothermal energy production units at The Geysers are of interest to visiting species...;38.7943;-123.0039
