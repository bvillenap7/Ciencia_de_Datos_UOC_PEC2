I looking out over the mountain ridge and noticed a reddish sphere in the sky moving left and right along the ridge so I said “what is that?” because there was no noise coming from it and it also moved unlike anything else I had seen before.  I pointed to it and I had to ask my boyfriend again what it was and he said he didn’t know.  When he said he didn’t know what it was either the red sphere jet back and forth in a couple of different directions in a radical fashion and then it blinked out and disappeared.  We both felt as if we were being watched and got spooked out and went home. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));38.7943;-123.0039
