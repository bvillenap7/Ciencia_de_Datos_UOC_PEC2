UFO  over Beverly Hills/ West Los Angeles;2008-09-06 22:25:00;9-10 Min;UFO  over Beverly Hills/ West Los Angeles I just got of work and I was waiting for my sister out side my work place to give me a ride home. They were running a little late so I set down on a bench, approximately five minutes after I sat down, for some reason I turned my head facing east and at that moment i saw the round craft. My first reaction was to run and hide in the garage, and that is what I did. After that I called my sister and told her where are you, there is something trying to land on the other side of the street. My mom was also in the car with my other two sisters as well, and she was the one who picked up the phone,she replayed what are you talking about. So I replayed something is landing, and hanged up. I was looking at it and it was trying to land a yellow bluish light came from the center of it but there was no sound, and they aborted the landing. At that time I tried to run about a block to the gas station,I must have run about 10 feet and there it was again trying to land. So I ran back to the garage again and called my sister again and asked them where are you guys, they replayed we are six blocks a way and we see a light it must be a helicopter or a airplane, and they said it's moving away. After that they came and picked me up. As soon as we got of the driveway and on the street all of the sudden the round craft was hovering over the building where I work and half of the four lane street, and it was pulsating red and blue lights and no sound. So we drove away as fast as we could from there, and after a few seconds it vanished out of our sight. I will ask at work tomorrow if they have recorded anything on the surveillance cameras at the building.;34.0723853949332;-118.393940238449
