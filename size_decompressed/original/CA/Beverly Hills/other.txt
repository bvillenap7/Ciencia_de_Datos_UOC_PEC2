((anonymous report));2018-01-15 17:45:00;45 minutes;We spotted a strange object in the sky that was not a bird, kite or plane, or drone.  On Jan. 15, 2018 at  5:45 pm in the mid western sky elevation at 500 feet, drifting through the Beverly Hills on Coldwater Canyon between Benedict Canyon in a wilderness area of the canyon and up to Tree People park, an unidentified flying object was noticed  by resident  500 feet away at the top of the canyon. The object had characteristics similar to a hugh hawk but the size of a small plane.  It used the wind which was documented at 3.4 miles per hour by the US weather service.  The object seemed to be shaped with sharp angles similar to a extra large hawk or F-16 fighter jet.  The size of the object was 30-40 feet in length.  No flashing lights.  The object was 20- 30 feet in width wing span. Other characteristics was the object seemed to be alive or have a living presence.  It was not a hang-glider.  I felt like it knew no one was watching it.  As it ascended slowly with no wind current, I called a 2nd witness and it was higher in the sky but in the same location and it remained in the same location 2000 ft in the air until dark.  It was able to stay in the same location in the sky. It looked like a huge dark angel and kind of writhed in movement.  It looked like a scene out of the film City of Angels, it was real in real life.
