6-8 lights flying in formations above LOS ANGELES;2010-09-05 17:00:00;15 min;6-8 lights flying in formations above LOS ANGELES I am a chef that was working at the Food and Wine festival in Beverly Hills today.  At around 5 pm I happened to look up at the sky when I noticed two lights flying horizontal from one another.  They were very bright and obviously not helicopters as they were flying at too high an altitude and not planes as it was still daylight and I could not see the normal outline of a plane.  Behind the first set of lights I observed an identical set of lights flying the same pattern.  The objects also appeared to have a slight wobble to their flight path which was unlike anything I have ever seen in the sky.  Also my co-worker standing next to me he noticed it appeared the lights had sort of a energy field surrounding them.  When the lights reached the middle of the sky at least 6-8 new lights began to appear and the lights began to form different formations in the sky.  The changing of formations lasted between 10-15 min and then the lights vanished.;34.0723853949332;-118.393940238449
At least 20 round w/ sparkle of lights on them.;2012-10-28 10:00:00;30 minutes;At least 20 round w/ sparkle of lights on them My friend and I saw at least 20 round objects with a sparkle of light on them floating in the sky.   They made a straight line formation and then floated away.   We pointed it out to 2 other people in the area.
