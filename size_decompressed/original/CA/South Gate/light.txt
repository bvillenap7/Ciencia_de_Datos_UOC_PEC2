At first I thought it was a helicopter but there was no sound and usually I would see a flashing blue light also if it was a helicopter but there was none it was silent and was heading from the south coming from Huntington Park area toward our house in South Gate where I was watching it and then it just stopped and stood still for a moment and then still a red glow to it about medium not large or really small.   Then it glided to the left toward the east and I kept my eyes on it and watched it as it got smaller and went to a pin point and I did not see it any more.;33.9441000000001;-118.198

PD)) There was this strange light in the sky. It was surrounded by this cloudy mist, and had a blue trailing light behind it. It seemed to travel very fast. It was plainly visible to everyone. The light was white, and very bright. The Trailing cloud looked to be what I would see on pictures of comets, but I can't be too sure about that. It looked like it passed through our atmosphere, and then it vanished. When I first saw it, it had this strange triangle look to it, then it turned to a bright white light. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S.
