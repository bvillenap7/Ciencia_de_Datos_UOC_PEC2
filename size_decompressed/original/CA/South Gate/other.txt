Red Orb flyby at UFO Sighting Event in Los Angeles;2015-08-22 14:00:00;7 minutes;Red Orb flyby at UFO Sighting Event in Los Angeles LA UFO Channel on Meetup.com has a monthly/bimonthly UFO Sighting Event somewhere in Los Angeles.  The event is free and all are invited, especially for those who have never seen a UFO live.   This meetup was at Hollydale Park, South Gate, CA.  The one in the video has a green star balloon we call a marker (it could be anything).  A marker basically attracts attention and draws our cameras and video to itself.   Two orbs pass this marker.  I am capturing this footage with a telescope (Meade ETX 90, celestron zoom eyepiece, and a Sony A6000).  It takes a tracker and a focuser to run the telescope.  Many objects were captured at this event.  Another standout was what looked like a balloon cluster dropping an orb.  Three of us captured it on video.  Amazing footage.  Anyway,  hope you like this video.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uMu4HiRqsU;33.9441000000001;-118.198
