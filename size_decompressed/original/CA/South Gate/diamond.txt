I looked up and I wasn’t expecting to see what I had seen...  at first I thought to myself it’s a balloon someone accidentally let go or something but a couple minutes past and it was still there just hovering in the sky ... it appeared to be made out of something metal in a diamond shape ... as it was hovering and turned the sun I guess reflected off the object and suddenly would get super shiny/bright ... yes at this point I was recording with my phone ... once we went back in the house I went to go check out the video and when I played it and zoomed in I realized that there was a few flying around the hovering one .. but it was at speeds from somewhere else the other flying objects were shooting up and down so fast... as I kept watching the video there it was a pill shape object that flew by also something else that was long sort of cylinder ! shape... about 15-20 minutes past and I looked away for a second and when I looked back they were gone..;33.9441000000001;-118.198
