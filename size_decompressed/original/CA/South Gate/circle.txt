Flickering light in S California;2003-07-02 01:53:00;10-15 sec.;Flickering light in S California I was awake very late at night and I was looking out my window at the stars as usual to see if I could see another ufo I was just about to give up when around 1:50 am I saw an bright orange circle in the distance traveling SW to NE at moderate speed. All of a sudden its light started pulsating and flickering. The color on the craft turned from orange to a red, and then I suppose to make itself unnoticed turned of the lights on the craft however I could still see the gray body of the ship and it was continuing moving NE. Once it got to the point of the trees in my backyard I lost visual of it.;33.9441000000001;-118.198
Yellow orange hue sphere seen over Los Angeles city ,pass midnight.;2013-07-17 01:30:00;1 minutes;Yellow orange hue sphere seen over Los Angeles city, past midnight. On Wednesday morning approximately 130 am.  I observed a round aircraft that was of an orange color, it looked like the middle of the aircraft was spinning, so that a round orange light would do a 360 turn..  When it did this it shine more deeply when the 360 turn had occurred , no noise was heard.  It was traveling towards the West , South.   I tried getting it on my IPhone.  A video, but my lense on my IPhone couldn't take a good picture nor the orange hue was visible. Cause it was too far for the lense.. Then at approximately at 430 am. I saw a bright, bright white light hovering above me, no sound was coming from it..  The light was bigger then a regular plane.  It had no blinking red, or blue lights..  That's why I know it wasn't an airplane..   I did take a video of it for only 20 secs.  But the light seemed bigger then in the video.;33.9441000000001;-118.198
