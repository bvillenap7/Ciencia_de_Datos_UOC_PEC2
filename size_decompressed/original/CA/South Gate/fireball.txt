I was a star in the distance and I did a double take because of the color of it and the fact that it was moving closer. I sat up in bed completely astonished and a little curious. It was high in the sky but I could see it was like an orange fireball and it was kind of hazy looking. It was moving silently and too slowly to be a helicopter or plane. It was coming from the south east. I looked at it until I couldn't see it anymore after it went over my roof. The whole thing lasted around 2 minutes.;33.9441000000001;-118.198

I noticed three fireball objects make a triangular shape for about ten minutes.;2013-05-11 21:35:00;10 minutes;I noticed three fireball objects make a triangular shape for about ten minutes. I was driving when I turned and faced South and told my girlfriend &quotHey, why is that star so red?&quot To which she responded, &quotWhich one?&quot. I then noticed that there were two more objects near the initial object I had first noticed. There we're no visible stars or were there any airplanes or helicopters in the area near by. We then witnessed the three objects start to move and make a few triangle patterns facing North and East respectively. The three objects were a bright red and did not change color. We followed the lights for about ten minutes, at one point being directly below them. At that point I did notice the lights on my dashboard start to dim a bit but didn't notice any radio interference. After a few minutes of observing the lights, I noticed that two more objects were starting to appear in between the triangular shape. As I turned the street I lost sight of the lights and at that point, my girlfriend said that two of the lights sp! ed off in an Eastern direction and the rest in a Western direction. I would also like to add that the lights did not become dim at any point and there was no trail around them (e.g. flare);33.9441000000001;-118.198
