Large red UFO seen over Sierra Hwy, that changed position and colors within milliseconds.;2017-11-25 21:05:00;3 minutes;Large red UFO seen over Sierra Hwy, that changed position and colors within milliseconds. On the night of Saturday, November 25, 2017, I was walking my dog in Newhall, CA, when I noticed a giant red light in the sky, and it was not a plane.  I audibly said “No Way,” and stopped to watch.  I could not stop staring as it seamed to be fixated on me and my dog.   It then turned off the light and within a millisecond was quite close to us, although I was not really able to make out the shape.  It would sit still turning the light on and off and then would “dart” from one side of the sky to another, doing maneuvers that I have never ever seen before.  It did this for approximately 2-3 minutes.  It was unbelievable to watch.   It then turned to a smaller light green and blue light flying away at incredible speeds and continuing with the impossible maneuvers done earlier.  It was an experience that I will never forget.  It was very quiet also for a Saturday night, no cars that I can remember driving by or anyone walking like usual.;34.3768;-118.5208
