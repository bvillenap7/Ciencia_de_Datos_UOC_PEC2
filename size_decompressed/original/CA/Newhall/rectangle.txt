My ex wife son and his 11 year old friend were with us.  We were going home after seeing the movie at the drive in theater (Disney movie).  We were on the freeway overlooking the city of New Hall, Ca.  The craft was enormous.  It looked like a floating city.   By the time we went under the freeway overpass we were less than one eighth mile from driving directly under the craft.  It was bigger than a aircraft carrier.  As we came under the freeway overpass there was 3 Ca. highway patrol cars and 3 or 4 private cars parked along the road into the town.  The strangest thing about the sighting (except the humming sound)  We never talked about the sighting until a few months ago.  I had asked my son if he remembered the sighting.  He not only clearly recalled it.  He called his Mom, and she remembered it exactly as we did!;34.3768;-118.5208

I was walking my dog at 10:45 am and saw this very bright red light in the sky and watched it coming from the north and wondered what it was and I had an spotting scope with me and focused on it for about one minute and wondered what I was looking at as  the red light was so bright that it was hard to see where it was coming from traveled going south and was not making any sound and as the red light was so bright in the daylight very powerful and strange   I could see that the craft/? had a haze around it and looked like a square balloon and made me wonder what kind of light could be so bright in the day light. I seen a picture on UFO sighting 2015 and would say that they were the same type of craft or it was the same craft and I would like to thank that person for posting that picture as I was wondering what I had seen.;34.3768;-118.5208
