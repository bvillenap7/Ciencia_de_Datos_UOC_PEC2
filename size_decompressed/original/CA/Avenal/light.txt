Two bright lights moving extremely fast and change directions, zig-zagging through the sky.;2003-08-31 02:30:00;3.5 seconds;Two bright lights moving extremely fast and change directions, zig-zagging through the sky. My family and I were traveling home from Los Angeles to San Jose on Highway 5 and I noticed 2 bright lights in the westward sky.  I thought it was a helicopter at first, since it was pretty stationary and the lights were bright.  The lights we're not blinking.  The weird thing that happened was that this object swooped down in front of the SUV in front of me and the SUV broke hard.  I've never seen an aircraft move that fast and change directions so quickly.  I woke up my wife immediately and told her that I thought I just saw a UFO.  I looked to the east to see if there was a neighboring airport in the vicnity and there was nothing out there.  I looked in my rear view mirror and saw the lights move upwards erratically zig-zagging throught the sky.  I knew for sure that was no ordinary aircraft.  Nothing to my knowledge, could move that fast and change directions so quickly.  I was hoping to catch the SUV at a gas station to ask him what he saw because it looked like he got a better view of it than I did, since he had to brake in order on to collide with it.  Before this event, I never believed in these types of things but now I'm a true believer.;35.9909;-120.1197
3 round lights-I-5 in Avenal, CA (North of Kettleman City).;2015-06-07 21:18:00;3 seconds;3 round lights -  I-5 in Avenal, CA (North of Kettleman City) We were driving North on I-5 (about 5-10 minutes north of the 76 gas station in Avenal, CA) and noticed three bright round lights moving East to West) about 1/2 mile in front of our vehicle.  All this happened anywhere between 9:18 - 9:19 pm at night so it was dark (and I had just gotten off the phone with my brother, which is why I know when this happened)... One light was ahead of the three lights, while the other two were closer aligned to one another...  In unison the lights then changed their flight path and headed south west and looked  as though they were landing on the tree Orchard west of the highway. Before we knew it the lights were gone.  They disappeared into the Tree Orchard. As it was dark, I was unable to see if the lights were attached to one aircraft or if each light was attached to an individual aircraft. We did not hear sound coming from the lights... This happened over the course of 3 seconds (or so), so there was not enough time to take a picture or video of these lights.;35.9909;-120.1197
