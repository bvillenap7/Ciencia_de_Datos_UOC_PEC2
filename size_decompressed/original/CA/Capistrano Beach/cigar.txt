Rotating tall objects sighted over South Orange County Southern California with no sound.;2008-09-20 21:15:00;15 minutes;Rotating tall objects sighted over South Orange County Southern California with no sound. Two objects moving from southeast to northwest. First object moving very fast. From one side of horizon to other in about 5 minutes. Second object at first appeared to have no movement. The night had patchy low clouds, but both objects were below the cloud cover or just hitting it. We could see commercial jets going by on the way to SNA (Orange County Airport) that would go through clear areas, then be totally obscured by clouds. The pilots should have had a clear view of both objects.  Both objects appeared to be identical. We used a spotting scope to observe the second slower object. It appeared to be a tall shape and had multiple (from 3 to 8) lights that were rotating.  Location: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=92624&ie=UTF8&z=14;33.4634;-117.6608
