Red triangles and piercing sound in Southern California on 5/6/07;2007-05-06 22:00:00;2 minutes;Red triangles and piercing sound in Southern California on 5/6/07 While swimming in the pool, we saw a triangle formation of 3 red lights that traveled around it in a clockwise direction twice very quickly.   It then stopped and reversed to counter clockwise and then went black and moved to the right about 1/2 mile.  It repeated the clockwise pattern, then proceeded to climb straight up, and went counterclockwise once.  Then it hovered for a few seconds with all lights illuminated then disappeared.   About 10 to 15 minutes later, we were looking towards the Cleveland National Forest for the lights, and a piercing noise was heard from the 3 of us.  One of us was even under the water and was able to hear it.  When he came up from under the water, he asked if we heard it as well.   At that point we hurried up and went inside.   Are we the only ones that witnessed this or is there anyone else that saw or heard this?;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
Triangular shaped object flying erratically yet fluid in the sky.;2009-07-13 11:10:00;5 minutes;Triangular shaped object flying erratically yet fluid in the sky. I was walking out the house with my grandma and i saw in the sky towards the hills skyline a strange light or lights the color of tourquise and green flying eratically yet in a fluid motion.  We watched for a few minutes in amazment because it was so high up in the sky and moved so fast. We then called my aunt and it was still flying all over the place then we saw i plane fly towards it and the weird object started following it in a straight line and just as fast.  It finally stopped and went backwards but slower this time.  It floated around some more then it almost seemed like it flipped sides and looked like a regular star in the sky and dropped and it was out of vision.  My aunt and i stood outside for about ten minutes after that but we saw nothing.  I have to say i have never believed in ufos and never in my life thought something would come to earth and ive even had arguments with my boyfriend over the subject but this was something i just couldnt explain and it was amazing.  And im also very sorry for the poor writing but im a little shaken up at the moment.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
White lights on triangular object over corona;2010-01-16 19:49:00;5 Minutes;White lights on triangular object over corona My cousin and I were walking her dog around 19:49 PM on saturday night when I had turned around and noticed a strange object had came into view behind a tree.  The object appeared triangular in shape, traveling from West to East at a slow speed.  It had five white lights on what appeared to be the side of the object.  As it passed over, there were ten lights on the rear. The lights would flash from the corners torwads the middle and repeat.  All the lights on the object were the same color, white, and the same size.  As it passed infront of a cloud, it appeared to be a flat on top as well as the bottom.  The object made no sound as it had hovered by. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
V-shaped craft observed at low altitude moving swiftly from north to south over Corona California;2010-12-09 19:45:00;4 minutes;V-shaped craft observed at low altitude moving swiftly from north to south over Corona California On December 9, 2010 at approx 7:45 pm PDT I was driving southbound I-15 five miles south of Corona, CA. Just passed Temescal Canyon Rd exit, spotted what first appeared to be three lights in a delta formation heading directly towards me. Altitude estimated 3,000 above ground based on mountain range reference parallel to the interstate. This configuration appeared unconventional, so I immediately pulled over onto the shoulder about 1/2 mile south of Temescal Canyon Rd. I exited my vehicle and observed three pairs of lights, each pair blue and red, in a delta configuration move relatively fast and amazingly smooth almost directly overhead in a northwest/north direction. As it flew overhead the sets of lights appeared to be embedded in a flat surface shaped in a boomerang or v shape body. very pitch black colored. Each light was ring shaped, not solid oval. Each pair of lights were on each wing tip as well as the leading nose. The lights were not blinki! ng or strobing. There was no apparent navigation light system as expected in conventional aircraft. Lights remained on constantly. It took about 30 seconds for the lights to reach overhead from the moment I pulled over, and I observed the object for an additional 3-4 minutes as it eventually faded out of site. What was impressive was that it banked slightly to the left at times as a single solid object and it its massive size was made apparent because even as its lights waned in the distance, its size became smaller very slowly as it got farther away.  I could not verify any sound emitting from the craft as it was too noisy from cars on the interstate passing by.  A good way to describe how big it was when over my head is to raise your hands above your head and spread them apart about 3 feet. That was the span from wingtip to nose tip.  I was alone in my car, however the interstate was very busy with many cars heading southbound, and there was another car who had pulled over about 200 meters ahead of me at the same time I did. It appeared they were observing this object as well. They remained there as long as I did, and I attempted to approach them to ask them if they had observed the same object, but they left the scene as I approached them in my car.  At 7:55pm PDT I texted a friend with my cell phone about my sighting and then I continued on for home. I live approx 5 miles south of where my sighting was.  Although I had a video capable cell phone, I was not able to have enough time to get my composure and get a video of the object.  There had to be many more people who were driving to witness this craft. If it was that obvious to me what I saw, other drivers had to see it too. There were many cars driving alongside of me at the time of the sighting.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
