bright ring shaped ufo over corona california;2007-11-03 19:30:00;2 min;bright ring shaped ufo over corona california My family and I witnessed  a fast bright light that stopped and turned into a ring shaped ufo that was white and brightly lit up. It had a red light that disappeared on and off. It moved in a very bizarre way with twists and turns. Then it would disappear  into a dot like a star. It lasted about 2 minutes , we were able to see it until it went out of view behind the trees.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
I saw a rod/sky fish 15 feet above my head in the middle of the day.;2009-09-26 00:00:00;5 minutes;I saw a rod/sky fish 15 feet above my head in the middle of the day. I was standing outside at noon talking to my neighbor.  I saw a glow above me.  I looked up and saw a rod/sky fish about 15 feet above my head.  It was coming from over my neighborâ€™s roof top and flew over mine.  If I was on a chair at the time and jumped up I could have touched it.  It was going very slow. It looked to be as long as a long straw, a half foot long.  It was glowing white.  It looked like a white shimmering laser lazer.  I should have chased it!  There were no signs of feet, head, wings, or tale coming from this creature.  I could see it clearly. This happened two weeks after another sighting I had that was reported. ((NUFORC Note:  The report is accompanied by multiple photographs of other sightings of anomalous objects.  In our opinion, the objects in the photos are suggestive of insects in flight, given the presence of what appear to be wings on either side of the object.  PD));33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
Flock of birds with headlights glide over valley in Southern California.;2014-01-05 16:00:00;5 minutes;Flock of &quotbirds with headlights&quot glide over valley in Southern California We live on a hill on the east side of the Santa Ana Mountains, which divide Orange County and Riverside County, in the western edge of Corona, CA.  I went for a walk up the hill from our home on Sunday, January 5, 2014, between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m.  It was still light, but the sun had just gone down behind the mountain top.   As I headed back down the hill toward home I noticed what looked like a flock of about 12-15 white/gray birds about the size of a seagull.  The odd thing was that each bird looked as though it had a LED headlight on it.    Since this is a hilly area we see many hawks that soar and glide through the valley areas.  These birds did not flap their wings, but glided overhead and then down into the valley area below and out of sight.  They were not in formation, but silently flew in a loose flock, soaring left and right together.  I have never seen anything like it before.  It was a puzzle to me what could cause the bright light on each bird.   Today (1-15-14,) I decided to Google birds with headlights and was very surprised to see a picture and video of what I saw!  The video was from January 2013 and apparently taken in Guadalajara!  They were calling them UFO's.  I would be interested to find out more information.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
Huge wide but only 1/4 as tall very brilliant white/dull orange and very erratic edges and shape.;2014-09-07 20:30:00;~5 minutes;Huge wide but only 1/4 as tall very brilliant white/dull orange and very erratic edges and shape. I could not tell that it was a craft but looked more erratic. Very bright not white but more white / orange. It had very jagged edges but not quite like fire.......it was very wide buy only about a quarter as high I saw a airplane also and it dwarfed it. It never moved at all and just disappeared. Not like a flare going out but just instantly gone......;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
Fast-moving light over the mountain range, near Corona, California in Southern California 5/5/2017;2017-05-05 20:00:00;2 minutes;Fast-moving light over the mountain range, near Corona, California, in Southern California 5/5/2017 Last night, while out on my balcony, I witnessed a bright light coming from the west, over the mountain range (Santa Ana Mountains) where I live in Corona, California.  This light moved faster then anything I have ever witnessed.  No blinking lights on it, I checked during the duration, my brother & ex-spouse were pilots, so I do pay attention to aircraft regularly.  This light continued high up into the atmosphere, way above where jets fly.   I contacted the news stations in Los Angeles, about 60 miles west of my home, to see if they had received any calls they reported no calls.   During the ascent of this light or craft, a regular jet with blinking lights was crossing over the mountain range during this time, but considerably lower, as I believe the jet was landing either at Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California, or headed to Burbank (Bob Hope Airport).  The pilot had to have seen this light.   When speaking with CBS News Station in Los Angeles, I asked the news desk if Vandenberg Air Force Base on the Central Coast of California had fired off any missiles, as they are known to do, and have been doing for the past month off and on, the news desk person told me there were no scheduled missile flights from Vandenberg until June 2017.   I wish I could have recorded this light, but do not have the means on my flip phone.   The local papers and web community sites listed nothing about it today.  Disappointed, as I am sure others witnessed this light.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
