single bright saucer shaped object  slowing propelling forward, with the front tilted downward;2003-04-10 19:17:00;1min.40sec;single bright saucer shaped object  slowing propelling forward, with the front tilted downward I noticed a bright object in the sky. It was contrasted against some dark clouds. It was hovering to the east at about 10 o'clock.It was saucer shaped with domes on the top and on the bottom. The front of the object was pointing downward. The object started to slowly propel from the left to the right. At times it would stop and just hover. I viewed the object for about 1 minute 40 seconds. It went behind a tree, and the time it took for me to get to a position to get a view of the object, it was gone. I had my video camera with me and I was able to capture the whole duration of the sighting. I am a nurse caring for an invalid in a wheel chair. I was out with the patient taking him for a walk. I have never carried a video camera to work but did on this day because the day before I had seen many contrails in the sky and I wanted to video tape any if they were like they were yesterday. The object I saw was in the same location that the many contrails were the day before. Also I will mention that the wind gained in force during the sighting and it became cold quickly. About 30 minutes after the sighting, the winds died down and it seemed to become slightly warmer.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
