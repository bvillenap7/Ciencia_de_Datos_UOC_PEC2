bright light headed ENE in daylight hours, very fast, changes in direction and speed, metallic object;2005-08-22 06:25:00;15 mins;bright light headed ENE in daylight hours, very fast, changes in direction and speed, metallic object the sun had just risen, daylight for about 40 mins, I noticed the moon was still visible (and close)  a very bright light came up from the horizon in the west, curved gradually to pass in between the moon and me, then kept heading in a straight line almost due east, maybe ENE, it seemed to speed up and continue at that velocity until it was directly overhead, then slowed down, and seemed to drift at about half of it's previous rate of speed. speed ??? it traversed the whole sky at a VERY high altitude -- it was a speck of light -- in about 10 mins.  I dont think i need to stress that this was NOT a meteor, plane, satellite, comet, weather baloon, and DEFINITELY was not swamp gas or ball lightning.  It reflected the sun as if it were metallic, and was changing orientation, there was a glinting effect. It had it's own luminescence in daylight, and got brighter as it sped up, dimmer as it slowed.  Also, it seemed to be emitting a field, like a wavy aura, that also got brighter and dimmer, but on a lesser scale than the object itself. I called out other people to look, and they confirmed that my eyes were not playing tricks on me, they also saw the object, witnessed it's deceleration, and the strange aura that fluctuated between light and dark. i hope this is useful to someone...;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
CA, Corona White Flashing Lights;2010-01-16 20:00:00;3 min.;CA, Corona White Flashing Lights While driving, on a Saturday through industrial/ manufacturing area of our town near a railroad, we noticed flashing lights in the sky.  It was unlike anything weâ€™ve ever seen, to us the form was not clear, but what was clear was the shape and color of the lights.  It was six to seven squared lights lined up next to each other to form a long rectangle the lights flashed on and off in a sequence.  Centered above the lights was one squared light that did not turn off.  The light was intense with a true bright white color.  It seemed to hover close then went further until it went out of sight.  Also, we tried calling from a cell phone twice and the call would not go through.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
Star igniting accelerating and leaving a light beam behind.;2010-10-01 23:00:00;30 seconds;Star igniting accelerating and leaving a light beam behind. If you ever notice the two stars that are kinda of by the moon this night I got off work I just happen to look up at the sky and I notice that there was a extra light in between the two stars that are usually by the moon now you have to picture the moon with one star on top of the moon and the other on the bottom making the moon the object in the middle of both stars kinda like tic tac toe formation diagonal  now I notice that there was a third star  and I thought that's weird I never seen that third star by the moon.   Omg what happened next I will never ever forget  The star that appeared that didn't belong there.   All of a sudden in started getting brighter brighter and then it took off  toward the top of the moon at an enormous speed leaving a beam of light behind it it got from the bottom of the moon to the top in seconds and it disappear leaving a trail of light.  Now I know for sure that did not belong to man.  The speed was way to fast from a stationa! ry position    Yeah right. We don't have those type of crafts.  What I witnessed  made my conclusion  and answered my question that are we alone.  No we are not.  Only those that have been selected to have the privilege to have witnessed such an event know the truth...........;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
Possible UFO sighting in Corona, CA. Silvery reflective object  flying at altitude suddenly stops and hovers.;2012-08-19 10:45:00;5 minutes;Possible UFO sighting in Corona, CA.  Silvery reflective object  flying at altitude suddenly stops and hovers. I stepped outside my home in Corona CA to have a cigarette and I looked up into the sky.  It was clear with no clouds.  A silver grey object was moving across the sky reflecting the suns as it traveled.  It appeared small so I assumed it was either a jet or helicopter, and appeared to be at a high altitude.   We get a fair amount of commercial and military air traffic so at first I didn't think much of it.   The thing that kept my interest was its odd shape, which was somewhat boomerang shaped and the total lack of sound.   Then it slowed down smoothly and rapidly and stopped in one place and hovered.  I observed it for a few minutes trying to determine what the heck it was.  I pointed it out to my sister who was also outside.  I knew right away this was out of the ordinary.   I ran inside my house to get my camera, and by the time I returned, it was gone.  I was gone for at best 20 seconds. I scanned the sky and there wasn't a sign of it.  If it had been a helicopter or jet, it would still have been in visual range.  This is the damnedest thing I have ever witnessed.  I know aircraft, and what is and is not possible, and I have no explanation for what could do this.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
Something over Corona, CA, sky.;2017-02-28 21:37:00;~30 seconds;Something over Corona, CA, sky. Driving home from work on the 91 West, very overcast and dark  night - (we had a lot of rain that week) left work at 21:30, reached about past McKinley St, heading towards the 15 South interchange.   About 3 mins before interchange, I see two bright lights (rt and left) headed coming in towards me on the freeway, as if it is going to land on the freeway!  I notice the lights are kind of low for an airplane, and I know helicopters and aircraft (spent 23 years in the military.)  I was wondering why the plane was so low (it was going to be really low on the ramp I was approaching above me (that goes North South) (some street, not a freeway), and it goes lower and I am thinking it will hit the edge of the above ramp!  Then I see that this thing is going to go over my car, it is going Easterly above the freeway, then it goes over my car (turning towards the mountains where the rock quarry is on Temescal Canyon street and Cajalco.   As it goes over my car, I feel a pressure change in the air.  Silent-still.  I strained to see what it was as I was driving, but the clouds sort of hid it, but I could make out a massive heavy black thing (almost blending in with the sky - but you could feel it there. It went back towards the mountain.  As it flew over the car (it was going East South while I was still going West), those two lights I had seen were now off.  I could not figure out how this plane (I thought) could disappear like that.   When I got home, I told the person I live with about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
Lights that appeared while moving in a triangular form until disappearing.;2019-09-20 20:43:00;<1 minute;Lights that appeared while moving in a triangular form until disappearing. Ok, so this has been bugging me for the past few days because of random constant reminders I have been having through the my time after seeing something in the sky. I don't know what it was I saw but I know that I could not explain and have not seen anything like that before. I live in kind of a secluded house not like other homes but right next to a community park.  I was laying in bed with my boyfriend when his sister started yelling for help to find her dog. Apparently her dog had just out of nowhere freaked out and ran off our property.  I got a flash light and started looking around the property with my boyfriend.  Around 8:43 or around that time (I didn't have my phone on me), I happened to look in the sky at the perfect time.  What I saw was a formation of lights just suddenly appear in a triangular shape (when they appeared they were moving forward) before disappearing quickly (while moving forward).  Honesty I find it hard to explain all together. The only thing I saw were lights but staggered in a triangle shape but a triangle without the bottom line lit up if that makes sense.  There were maybe 9 lights, there was no noise at all. This happened very fast and unfortunately my boyfriend did not see it.  My sisters boyfriends came back from taking her car out to look for her dog and luckily she had the dog.  She said she had found her dog had run pretty far off near the area I had seen this in the sky.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
