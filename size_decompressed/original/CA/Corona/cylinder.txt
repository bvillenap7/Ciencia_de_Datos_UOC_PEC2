Caught on video, another object in the sky;2003-04-11 19:16:00;2 minutes;Caught on video, another object in the sky I videotaped, on my camcorder, an object on April 10th, and had submitted a report pertaining to this. The next day I went to the same location and videotaped another object. There was also another person with me viewing the object. I was alittle startled to see another object in the sky so when I took my eyes away to place them on the viewfinder of the camera I had difficultly relocating it. My friend was talking to me with his back to the object. I told him to look around and tell me if he sees what I was seeing. He said he did. We were looking west, towards the Pacific Ocean. I was about in the same vicinity as the one I had seen yesterday, but it looked very differant. It was a white cylindrical object in straight horizontal flight. I was traveling very slowly. We followed it for about 2 minutes until it went behind a dark cloud. I estimated the object to be about 5000 feet altitude and possibly 25-30 miles away. I estimate the distance because I can see Cucamonga Peak to the north, which is about 24 miles away. To the left I have a range of mountains which house some communication towers and I found that the peak they are situated on are about 5600 feet in altitude. When I reviewed my videotape,I didn't see the object which my friend and I were seeing. I did have the audio with descriptions of the sighting being heard. I was disappointed not having captured the object. However I reviewed the tape just recently and I was surprised to notice the object was captured for a brief moment. I see a bright object flash and then quickly dart upward and stop. This was the craft I had seen before it initiated a straight horizontal flight pattern. At this point the sighting was documented by audio means. I had seen two objects on the 10th and the 11th, at the same location, at approxiamately 7:15PM. I went back to the same location on several occasions since then, but have not seen anything unfamiliar in the sky.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
BRIGHT SILVER OBJECT APPEARING THEN BECOMING INVISIBLE;2007-07-28 13:00:00;1-2 seconds;BRIGHT SILVER OBJECT APPEARING THEN BECOMING INVISIBLE I WAS IN MY BACKYARD DOING SOME WORK ON MY FENCE AND STOPPED TO ADMIRE THE VIEW WE HAVE OVERLOOKING THE MAIN CITY OF CORONA. IT IS A GREAT VIEW OF THE MOUNTAINS AND THE 91 AND 15 FRWY EXCHANGES. IT WAS A VERY CLEAR DAY AND AS I WAS LOOKING OVER THE FENCE A CRAFT APPEARED MOVING APPROX. NORTH TO SOUTH ACROSS MY LINE OF VISION. IT WAS BEUTIFUL, LONG, AND VERY SILVER IN COLOR, ALMOST TRANSLUCENT WITH A SLIGHT AURA OR HAZE AROUND IT. IT WAS MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE APPROX 500 FT ABOVE GROUND, MAKING NO SOUND AND MOVING APPROX 200 MPH OR A LITTLE FASTER THAN A LIGHT PLANE WOULD TRAVEL IN THE SAME AIRSPACE. I DONâ€™T HAVE A FEEL FOR THE LENGTH, OTHER THAT IT WAS LONGER THAT A SMALL AIRPLANE. IT APPEARED THEN VANISHED WHILE MOVING AND WAS VISIBLE FOR 1 TO 2 SECONDS ONLY. INITIALLY I THOUGHT I WAS SEEING THINGS BUT NOW AFTER THE FACT I BELIVE WHAT I SAW WAS REAL. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

A bright red travelling light disintegrated in the night sky over Southern California, USA.;2019-07-28 23:45:00;10 minutes;A bright red travelling light disintegrated in the night sky over Southern California, USA. A bright, red light could be seen by me in the night sky.  I thought it was strange, so I made several videos of it with my smartphone camera.  It travelled slower than an airplane, and did not make any noise.  I watched it for about 10 minutes. After about 7 minutes from the time I spotted the red light travelling from left to right, I saw the second witness and pointed out the UFO to him.  I asked him what it might be.  We watched it for about 2 minutes. About 9 minutes from the time I spotted it, drops of white and red alternating light fell off of the bright, red light.  Each time a drop of light fell, the red UFO became dimmer.  Finally, after many drops of light fell and disintegrated, the red UFO disintegrated completely and no more drops of light fell, as they had nothing to fall from.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
