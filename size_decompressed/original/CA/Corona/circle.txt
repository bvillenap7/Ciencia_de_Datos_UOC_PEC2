One bright white circular object traveling West to East at very high altitude.;2007-09-24 19:50:00;10-15 sec;One bright white circular object traveling West to East at very high altitude. While in my backyard hot tub I observed one bright white circular object traveling West to East at a very high altitude. There was a full moon and it was a very clear night. The object seemed very fast for such a high altitude. There were no flashing lights and no vapor trail. Did not here sound but my hot tub jets were on. The object resembled a very small moon. I live near a LAX flight path and watch hundreds of aircraft every few days and the object I saw was clearly different from any I’ve ever seen. I watched the object for 10-15 seconds and then ran inside to retrieve video camera but object was gone when I returned to my back yard. I’m 42 years old and have always been fascinated by UFO’s since I was 10.  I’ve been watching the skies for 32 years and this is the first UFO I’ve ever seen.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
I was driving with my girlfriend heading north on Temescal canyon road/Ontario avenue. Directly in front of me at a very far distance,;2009-02-21 20:30:00;40 seconds;I was driving with my girlfriend heading north on Temescal canyon road/Ontario avenue.  Directly in front of me at a very far distance, a light caught my attention.  I didn’t think anything of it at first I even mentioned calmly to my girlfriend  I wonder what that light is?   As we kept driving that far light happened to have gotten a lot closer all of a sudden to where we were able to see more definition of the light and began questioning this light, and started trying to follow it. We saw it for a few seconds before trees and houses began getting in the way of our site of the object.  So I proceeded to turn right into State St. heading in the direction that the light appeared to be going.  I made a right onto smerber Rd and saw the light again in the Northeast direction, the light was definitely round but I wasn’t close enough to see the actual object, I only saw the light it was generating. After the second time we didn’t see it anymore.  The UFO appeared to be moving northeast and getting lower because houses and the mountain in the area began to get in the way of my girlfriend and my vision.   I am convinced that I saw a UFO,  I just wanted to get closer to see more  Which was really hard at the speed it was moving and the landscape in that area that is really hilly which can block ones vision.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
Three orange circular objects in the evening sky hovered for 12 minutes and then vanished.;2009-09-12 10:30:00;12 minutes;Three orange circular objects in the evening sky hovered for 12 minutes and then vanished. I heard my neighbors outside late last night.  They were in awe as they saw three red/orange objects in the clear sky.  I witnessed these three circular shaped objects in the sky, over eighty thousand feet above.  The objects seemed to be as high as the highest dimly lit star.  They were as small as the smallest farthest star.  I was standing  at 33degrees 52’13.03” N.  117 degrees 33’45.71”W.  looking 75 degrees to the south by south west. The objects were in my sight for about 10 to 15 minutes.  They made no sound.  Two of the objects simultaneously moved at a 90 degree angle south with the third object shooting out at a 90digree angle North.  If the moon were to be in place directly behind the objects then the objects would be the width of two moons.  The objects then went so high that I could not longer keep them in sight.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861

Alerted by my German Shepherd, I saw a very ultra white, very bright round light slowly traveling west.;2021-04-16 21:48:00;45 seconds;Alerted by my German Shepherd, I saw a very ultra white, very bright round light slowly traveling west. On the night of April 16, 2021, at approximately 9:48pm, I was in my backyard waiting for my German Shepherd to do her business. I was looking at my phone and I noticed she had walked up next to me. As I looked over to her, I saw she was looking up to the sky behind me and she had her head cocked in a manner to say “What’s that?”  I turned around and looked in the direction she was looking, which was almost true North, and I saw a very ultra white, very bright round light. Although I can’t say for sure, my initial thoughts were that it was maybe a mile or mile and a half away (using Magnolia Av. to my north as a possible point of reference), traveling slowly in a westerly direction. I quickly brought up my cell phone camera, switching it from photo to video, and hit the record button, as something was strange about this light. My first thought was that it was a drone, however there were no red/green direction lights on it that I could see, and there were no sounds coming from it’s direction that you associate with a drone’s propellers, and the size seemed way too big for a drone that distance away.  The object’s direction of flight took it behind a large tree in the parkway behind and next to my house. I was able to watch it continue westward through breaks in the tree’s foliage. I could see the moon to the west, also behind the tree. It was in the waxing crescent phase. The object continued and visually appeared to pass to the left and under the moon, where I lost it behind the heavy tree foliage. I tried to position myself to see if it would appear below the tree’s foliage but I couldn’t see it anymore. I could only guesstimate the distance it traveled as maybe to Main St., approximately a mile and a half west of me, however it may have continued much farther.  I posted my video on a local social media site, wondering if anyone else had seen it. One female posted she saw it and thought it was a drone. Another female posted saying she saw it from her windows and jumped out of bed. A third female posted the event was “filmed in (the city of) Murrieta too” (a city 30 miles south). A male posted he also saw it, saying it disappeared fast when he went to take a video. He said he and 2 others reported it to the UFO Reporting Center.  As with so many others, I’m on the fence whether to believe in UFO’s or not, but the stories have always fascinated me. I am a 30 year honorably retired sergeant from the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
