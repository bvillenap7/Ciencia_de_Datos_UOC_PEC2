lighted craft  over Corona that dropped a lighted object that hovered in the sky as the original craft departed.;2006-07-04 22:25:00;3 minutes;lighted craft  over Corona that dropped a lighted object that hovered in the sky as the original craft departed. I was standing on my patio when I noticed a lighted object moving slowly across the sky at a fairly low altitude (I would guess no more than 2000 feet). I watched it and noticed the object seemed to be completely lighted - from front to back, but no blinking or colored lights, just steadily illuminated. I watched it for a moment and it seemed to stop and hover - I would guess about a mile from where I was standing. It was stationary for about 1 minute then a lighted object dropped from underneath the lighted craft and dropped straight down before looping back up behind the original craft and hovered behind it at the same altitude. I didn't hear any noise or sounds, other than the faint jet engines of the planes approaching LAX to land. The craft then started moving off to the northeast where it dimmed it's lights as it crossed the area where incoming LAX traffic began their approach but then illuminated again after a few seconds. The lighted object that dropped from the craft was still in the same location and I never saw it move, but eventually it just became non visible. I have no idea what I witnessed, but I don't believe it was a helicopter or airplane. Were there any other reports from the Corona California area on the evening of July 4th, 2006 ?;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
A light floating, moving, and hovering in the air.;2007-11-23 22:37:00;2-5 minutes;A light floating, moving, and hovering in the air. Well, to describe the UFO, it was very large or very near my residential area, but it was this sort of light and it had functions of a helicopter and rocket moving at a minimum speed of a jet, and it was moving in many different directions above air then it disappeared from a distance in the air to the depths of space it went, the color was a bright yellowish whitish scene.  I'm only a teenager in intermediate school, so you should have noticed the improper grammar or the way I how I put the tone in place.

Very bright brilliant white object  flying low altitude at an absurdly stunning speed.;2008-01-27 18:01:00;10-15 Sec;Very bright brilliant white object  flying low altitude at an absurdly stunning speed. I was on my back patio sweeping rain water puddles off my walkway when I noticed a brilliant bright white light coming towards my home from the northeast. I saw the object for about 5 seconds before it was nearly going over my home but it was slightly to the north of me. This thing went by at an unearthly speed, did not change directions and was completely silent. I watched the object streak away from me heading southwest. I estimate the object traveled horizon to horizon in 10-15 seconds. The atmosphere was very clear at the time of my sighting but there were a few scattered low clouds. The object seemed to be flying just above the low clouds and was flying parallel to the ground.  It was extremely hard to make out the shape due to the brightness and speed but it appeared to be a classic saucer shaped UFO. There was an amazing bright white glow around the object as it passed by and it was stunningly beautiful. I did have a camera phone in my pocket but obviously had no time to attempt a picture. It’s been about two hours since my UFO sighting and my heart is still racing with excitement. What was most shocking to me was how low this UFO was flying for such a remarkable speed and that it was silent! There must be others who witnessed what I saw.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
strange light maneuvering  along the foothills;2009-07-25 22:15:00;10 minutes;strange light maneuvering  along the foothills At approx. 22:15 local time in Corona, Ca I was standing in my front yard on the phone facing southwest towards the Cleveland national forest (which are hills that reach approx 3100 Feet in elevation) when I noticed a bright object moving across the sky at a high rate of speed and completely quiet!  The object first appeared to be higher than the hills but soon completely dropped out of view, only to then go vertical, and then change directions again going left to right and then right to left at a very high rate of speed. The object appeared to be the size of a star, with light colors ranging from mainly white to red as well as green. The object would change directions almost at an instance. I called out 2 other witnesses from my house to confirm what I was seeing.  Event lasted approx 10 min.  I also contacted a local ATC facility and they said nothing unusual spotted.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
Two bright lights still in sky then accelerate in opposite directions.;2013-03-11 20:18:00;1 minute;Two bright lights still in sky then accelerate in opposite directions I just walked outside in the backyard to take the dog out and saw two bright lights in the sky. At first I thought it was most likely planes, I looked again though and they were just stationary in the sky.   I have good vision and even using a tree in my yard as a fixed point could not find any movement from the objects. It seemed odd to me that they were so bright at such the distance they were at.  Almost like big flares in the sky but they kept dimming and then getting really bright but never faded. I then took out my phone to get a quick video of the lights.  Right after I put my phone away the light on the right started to move east, but didnt accelerate slowly it justs started moving at high speed instantly, I would say around 2-3 times faster than any commercial plane in the area at the time I could see.  Once that light was out of view the one on the left started moving to the west the same way, accelerating to a wanted top speed instantly and then just c! ruising along at that speed until out of view.  I stared at the lights in the sky for almost a minute before it took them roughly 10 seconds to both leave my view.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861

Quickly stepped out to balcony and noticed one blinking red light and a white light approximately 30 feet above heading north west at very high speed.  No noise other than the vibration sound when the objects passed over my home.  After about 1.5 min, the white light turned left crossing in front of the blinking red light, then disappeared.  Was unable to see any shape, just the light.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861

Helicopter Following a Ball Of Light.;2015-04-16 20:45:00;4-5 minutes;As my wife and I were driving westbound on the 91 freeway, about 2-3 miles east of the 15 freeway, we both noticed what appeared to be a VERY LARGE airplane or helicopter.  Right away we thought military craft, no biggie.   As we watched the craft we noticed it wasn't one big craft but a regular sized helicopter following a ball of light.  It gave the illusion of one big craft.  They were travelling south along the east side of the 15 freeway.  The helicopter was following about (best guess here) 80-100 feet behind the ball of light.  Then either the ball of light slowed down or the helicopter sped up and was about 30-40 feet behind the light.   Then as the helicopter got closer the light just went out.  The helicopter then just stopped and hover for awhile before circling the area before leaving to the south.   I went to Youtube to see if any one else saw and maybe recorded the event.  There was nothing, however there's a video from a few years back filmed in Anaheim (about 5-6 miles west of our sighting) that was very similar to what we witnessed.   I'm actually shocked having this happen at 8:30pm over a busy California freeways and there are no other reports or even videos/photos.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861

Reddish light traveling at tremendous speed above Cleveland National Forest;2017-05-27 20:00:00;5-8 seconds;Reddish Light traveling at tremendous speed above Cleveland National Forest June 11th, 2017.  On May 27th, 2017, around 8:00 p.m., while waiting for my clothes in the dryer, I was standing outside the garage doing some stargazing as I usually do.  I noticed a dull red light proceeding west to east at tremendous speed. Airline jets usually fly over at high altitude, which I can usually judge their speed, but this light I estimated had to be going close to 3000 mph.  It was in my sight coming from the west in an absolute horizontal line and didn’t deviate.  It was out of sight to the east about 5-8 seconds after I saw it.  Completely silent as well, no sonic boom either. It didn’t appear to be a meteor as there was no streak or tail.  It wasn’t a satellite that I’ve seen plenty of as well out here in the dark of Corona.  We are well away from the city lights. I was wondering if anyone else saw this light but no one I asked saw it or happened to be out looking up at the sky at that moment.  I am perplexed by what I saw as I am highly interested in aircraft but I cannot come up with an explanation for this light that I saw.

Horseshoe shaped glowing red light over Corona, CA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch.  PD))  ((anonymous report));2017-09-23 23:35:00;20 seconds;Horseshoe shaped glowing red light UFO over Corona, CA, seen over the Grand Ave. area. I was standing in my driveway smoking a cigarette, facing the street.  For some reason, I turned around and looked above my house, and in the distance, I saw the object.  It looked like a horseshoe only sideways and it was all light and emitting a sort of glow around everything but the center.   I screamed to my wife, “Look up at the sky!”, she was in the backyard letting my puppy out.   She came out to the front yard when she heard me screaming but by the time she came out it was gone.  It was moving very slowly over the horizon, the center of the object was a very bright orb, like a bright star, but the outer shape, the horseshoe-like tail was all red and leaving a trail, like a hazy glow.  It glided by for about 20 seconds and in an instant, it flashed into nothing.  It honestly scared me, my hairs all stood up and I was breathing heavily.  When it happened, I brought out my phone to record it but when I checked it, nothing had shown up on the video.  This has been the strangest thing I have ever seen in the sky.   It was not a plane or a meteor or anything I have ever seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
