White glowing orb chased by Helicopter over the 15 freeway in Corona, CA.;2015-04-16 20:25:00;8 seconds;White glowing orb chased by Helicopter over the 15 freeway in Corona, CA. April 16th, 2015, right around 8:25PM.  I was outside talking to my girlfriend on the phone while standing in my driveway scanning the clear, evening skies.  I do this often as I very much consider the area near my home a UFO hotspot.  I've had quite a few UFO sightings over the past 3.5 years and all were from this spot in my driveway. But since the last experience was October 19th, 2014, I was mentioning to the GF that it had, been a while since I'd seen any unusual space activity.  Not even a falling star.  She replied, Maybe that means something big is about to happen.  I'm looking down my driveway facing west toward Corona, CA, at this time.   As soon as she finishes that sentence, maybe 1.5 miles away from me, I see a helicopter flying north to south in persuit of a brightly lit, beachball sized, orb at about 90+ mph and 1000+ feet above the 15 freeway.  I ran to the end of the driveway in time to see them both disappear behind the foothills headed toward San Diego.  Probably 8 seconds total viewing time. I finished talking to the girlfriend and jumped on the computer to see if anyone else had seen what I had. I quickly found a group of 3 separate people sharing their experiences and I added mine as well. Like I said earlier, this is just one of a few sightings I've had over the past 3.5 years.  Some have been very bizarre, to say the least.  But as crazy and unbelievable as some of these reports may seem.  From my experiences, this phenomena is true and it's as real as you and me. If you haven't yet seen a UFO but always wanted to, here's the secretâ€¦ There is no secret.  Day or night, get yourself in the habit of looking up everytime you go outside.  Be patient, and keep your eyes to the skies.  It will probably happen sooner than you think.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
6 light silver spheres over Corona, making straight line formation of 4.  No sound.;2017-08-23 17:30:00;90 minutes;6 Light silver spheres over Corona,making straight line formation of 4.  No sound. Yesterday 6 of silver light objects very slow were flying in the blue sky over Corona and Riverside border.  One of the objects was bigger.  No sound.  They were shiny or disappearing sometimes.  All of them were spinning slow and fast, different speed and side.   Started from flying low to very high but very slow.  Just like yesterday.  They were coming close to each other and away.  They made a formation of 4 of them like straight line.  Then they gone up to the sky slow.  By the way,  just after they gone, the fire started in that area, but maybe just coincident.  Or maybe they were trying to point on the area where fire should start...?;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
19-20 large orange spheres over the hills of Corona Ca.;2019-09-07 22:20:00;10-15 minutes;19-20 large orange spheres over the hills of Corona Ca. Driving back southbound on Haven Ave in Ontario, Ca, and entering the city of Eastvale, about 12 bright spheres were rising from behind the hills of Corona.  they where in formation and then starting moving independently, some circling the larger spheres.  They started pulsing as the lights went out far above the tree line and hills as they where traveling North.   These where absolutely not Chinese lanterns, drones, helicopters, planes or anything familiar.  When I finally pulled over and jumped out of my car at a park in Eastvale (McCune Park) Another spectator was filming the event as well..  I do have some film footage;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
