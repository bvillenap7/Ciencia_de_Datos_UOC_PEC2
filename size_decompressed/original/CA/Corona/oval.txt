10 oval objects flying over Corona, California in broad daylight.;2012-10-02 13:00:00;10 minutes;10 oval objects flying over Corona, California in broad daylight. About 10 minutes ago, I stepped outside to go to my car.  Something caught my eye in the sky.  I noticed 10 white oval objects, which I first thought were balloons.  I watched them as they moved quickly from west to east towards the Riverside city area.  I thought they were being blown by the wind, but then I watched them all line up in one line, then scatter, but still staying in the same area together.  Also, it is 100 degrees today, and there is no wind,. I continued to watch and could see them approximately 1/2 mile away, what appeared to be movement, some type of back and forth maneuvers, left to right.  There were no lights on these objects and I could not hear any sound. I have two pilots in my family, one is a captain.  I have experienced many aircraft and I do not live far from the Ontario International Airport.  I see commercial jets fly over my home everyday, this was not like anything I have ever seen.  I am hoping someone else saw these objects ! and reported these to your site.  Very strange.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
