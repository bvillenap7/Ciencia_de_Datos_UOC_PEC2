Orange glow over Corona, California;2007-05-27 22:00:00;15 Minutes;Orange glow over Corona, California Orange Object in Sky   	The object slowly rose up from the ground into the sky. It looked like an orange fireball. The object started coming towards us, then it started back the other way. It looked liked it dropped some flames before it disappeared into space. Five other people saw this event with me. This was crazy and freaked me out a bit. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Green Fireball witnessed over Corona, CA;2008-06-15 00:00:00;5 seconds;Green Fireball witnessed over Corona, CA I was returning home late at night when a strange object in the night sky suddenly caught my attention.  I distinctly witnessed a large, bright green fireball traveling horizontally downwards at a relatively slow velocity.  It left no trail behind it, as would a meteor, yet had only a slight tail behind it.  I was only able to view it for a few seconds before it disappeared behind some nearby buildings. I remain firm in my conviction that what I saw was an actual object due to the fact that there was nothing to distort my view and that it was as clear and substantial as anything else to be seen by sober eyes.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861

3 orange hazy lights, possibly fireballs, seen over Corona, CA, and seen from Chino Hills, moving in very odd pattern slowly.;2017-01-02 20:00:00;3 minutes;3 orange hazy lights, possibly fireballs, seen over Corona, CA, and seen from Chino Hills, moving in very odd pattern slowly I was smoking a cigarette on my front porch and facing South -  South/West.  Looking up over the two story building across from me I saw what I thought was a plane or helicopter with orange lights.   As I looked closer, I could not see a blinking light required by aircraft and noticed there was 3 hazy orange lights.  The craft was coming straight towards my location in a normal flight pattern.  I only found the craft to be out of the usual when it began to slow down and without making any normal sounds or lose any altitude, it didn't make any sound but it was quite a distance away so that didn't mean a whole lot at this time.  After slowing down it started to drift diagonally to the South, the three orange lights still facing me.   At this time I was thinking to myself this is not normal for an airplane or helicopter.  The object then slowly moved directly to its right or East, again the 3 lights still facing my direction.  The lights had a orange haze around them and! then it started going in reverse and dropping altitude, these movements all happening in a smooth slow pattern.  It didn't last long but it was definitely strange as it disappeared or fell out of view.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
