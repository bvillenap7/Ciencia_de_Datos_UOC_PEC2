Objects in formation seen at approx 11:15AM in the SouthEast direction of Corona (Riverside), California;2012-01-11 11:15:00;5 minutes;Objects in formation seen at approx 11:15AM in the SouthEast direction of Corona (Riverside), California I was driving in the City of Corona traveling in a SouthEast direction.  I noticed approximately 4-6 objects in the sky which seemed to be flying in formation.  The object's color was that of a matte dark gray/black.  The shape was ovalish, but it was truthfully hard to make out an exact shape.  The objects in formation were traveling east at a slow speed, but would at times travel in the opposite direction at slow speeds as well.  There appeared to be to large streaks of smoke in the sky following the objects however, there was a large gap in between the streak.  The streak was temporary. I would also note that there was a lack of noise coming from the objects.  I was then waiting at a red light waiting to turn left while I continued to observe these objects.  The objects maintained a close formation traveling at a slow speed towards the SouthEast direction.  The objects then increased their speed and began traveling upwards.  When I made the left turn at the light,! the objects' visibility began to decrease.  I was attempting to view the objects while simultaneously driving.  When I looked in the directions I last seen the objects in formation, I could no longer find it.  The weather conditions did not exactly make for a bright and sunny sky due to some light clouds and fog burning off, but there was enough visibility to view anything that should of been in the sky.  I would also note that it may be due to excitement, but I believe that the number of objects in the sky, upon recollection, appeared to be more numerous at the the initial sighting of the formation as compared to when I last saw the objects.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
10 lights in perfect line formation flying silently at an unbelievable speed.;2020-11-25 05:15:00;2 minutes;10 lights in perfect line formation flying silently at an unbelievable speed. Saw what I first thought was a trail left by a meteor entry. It didn't dissipate and moved at a speed similar to a satellite to the south. I watched approx 10 lights in a perfect line formation for about two minutes before losing sight of it to the south toward San Diego. I am a retired Police officer and have been a private pilot for over 25 years. I have never seen any known crafts move at this speed with no sounds in such a perfect formation.;33.8696357569718;-117.546653784861
