I was driving my big rig southbound on interstate five.  I noticed four  what seem to be white clouds in a boxed area.  There was a dull  light in the center of the four clouds moving in a clockwise circular motion, as the  light moved to the top It was getting brighter and turned into a large seem to be flares or sparklers that lit up the sky.   I was able to pull over in a wide spot  and observe it closer this went on for approximately 20 minutes.  I took my phone and tried to do a video but unfortunately it was too dark.   I have been driving truck for 23 years and 16 years as a deputy sheriff.  I have never seen anything like this beforeâ€¦ I did call California Highway Patrol and they took a report of the event.   Just estimating from my location it was probably 30,000 feet in the air and what appeared to be over Sacramento.
