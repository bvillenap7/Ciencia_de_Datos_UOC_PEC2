At 17:50 pm I was sitting on my deck and looking directly above.  Suddenly there appeared a cone shaped object which I first took as a meteor.  The object appeared out of now where and traveled at a high speed straight across the sky to the west.  The object was viewed for about 7 seconds and it just disappeared in mid air.   The object did not drop in angle at anytime but maintained a straight line from my viewpoint.   Object was brilliant orange on the right end of the cone, then brilliant blue, and then a brilliant blue white like ice color on the end.  Was very large and not as high in the air as the numerous planes that traverse our area.   Exciting to see but a mystery.;41.2475;-122.1128
