I was about 4 or 5 years old, and I woke up in the middle of the night to get something to drink. I walked to the kitchen of the house that I grew up in, which had a very large window that ran along the west wall. I proceeded to the fridge, and took out my sippy cup that was already full of milk. I shut the fridge door and turned around to go back to my room. As I did that, I took a deep drink from my cup and looked up, and out of the window, I saw a purple spiral hovering in the sky, slowly rotating. The spiral was made from a soft glow of purple light, that was unlike any light that I have ever seen, and nothing more. It was about the size of a quarter if you held it up to the sky. I took a good look at the object for about 3 seconds, and I knew that it was something very, very strange. I got scared and ran back to my room. My second cousin was on leave from the military at the time, and he just so happened to be staying with us and sharing my room. I woke him up and told him what I saw. He went to go and have a look for himself. I don't remember what he said it was, or if he said he saw it. I remember what I saw as if it were yesterday, and it was not normal. The light appeared to be self contained, as if it were bottled. There was no apparent source of light, and the light itself was not too bright, it was more of a soft glow, sort of like a neon light.
