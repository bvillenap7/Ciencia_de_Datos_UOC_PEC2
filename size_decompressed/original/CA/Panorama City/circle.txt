Brilliant red light above Panorama City, in the San Fernando Valley, California;2003-01-17 22:35:00;15 minutes;Brilliant red light above Panorama City, in the San Fernando Valley, California At approximently 22.35 pm I sighted a red light in the sky, after driving for about a half a mile the red light was still in sight. After arriving home from work, about 8 minutes after first sighting the red light it was still in the sky. I ran to the front door of my home, and called my wife out to take a look at the light. We both look up at about a 11 o'clock position, the red light as still brilliant in color, stationary, and soundless. The object was circular in shape and looked as if there was a large red light in the center with 5 or 6 smaller red lights around the primatier. Now it has been about 15 minutes, two smaller white lights shot out from the object dimmed, and disappeared in a southernly direction. Then the red light dimmed, and moved in an upward angle in a northernly direction, then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and found him to be quite credible and serious-minded.
