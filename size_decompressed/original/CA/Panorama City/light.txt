I just went Outside my home to smoke a cigarette when I looked at the stars and I noticed an orb of light resembling a star but, with key differences. 1)  It was making itself brighter and would completely fade to black. 2)  Stars are stationary this was clearly moving and direct manipulation of acceleration and deceleration. 3)  It moved at least 20 to 30 mph from my distance. which was at least 300 yds northwest. I was astonished and shaken straight to the core.;34.2278;-118.442
