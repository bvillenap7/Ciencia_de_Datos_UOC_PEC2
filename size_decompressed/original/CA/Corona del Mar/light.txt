They were higher than normal aircraft. I was on the phone and got out of my car and looked out over the ocean and into the sky as usual before I went into the house.  It was beautiful and clear out.  Lots of stars.  I saw a formation of assorted flashing lights (white, red, blue) in the shape of the little dipper.  They/it caught my eye because the lights had color and were flashing.  At first it looked like a number of separate flying objects but they/it moved in unison like they were connected.  They/it was very high in the sky so I really cant say if they/it was one single or multiple flying objects.  All I could see were colored moving flashing lights.  There were about 8-10 of them. I watched them/it for a few minutes and noticed that they/it were moving south and changing shape.  I hung up the phone and called a friend to come out of the house and look.  By the time she came out, the lights were in a straight line formation and continuing south along the coast.  They/It changed formation in! to an S and then back to a straight line.  It looked as though they/it moved south and then up and dissappeared.;33.6008;-117.8775
