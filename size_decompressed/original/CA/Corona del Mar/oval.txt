Oval shaped disc maneuvering over Corona del Mar, CA;2007-11-04 20:45:00;8 minutes;Oval shaped disc maneuvering over Corona del Mar, CA We saw an oval shape disk maneuvering in the night sky above Harbor View and Spyglass in Corona del Mar. The upper portion of the craft is outlined with a row of very bright and highly visible (white) LED lights. We were inside our house, but went outside on our roof deck to watch more closely, but were too far away to hear any sound (if any). The disk is very agile and maneuverable in flight, performing banks and maneuvers not associated with conventional craft.;33.6008;-117.8775
