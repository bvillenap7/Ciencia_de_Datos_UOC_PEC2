White starlike lights in sky that blink red and blue and move erratically over Sacramento region.;2000-10-11 22:00:00;hours;White starlike lights in sky that blink red and blue and move erratically over Sacramento region. Starting on 10/11/00 My husband and I saw a light in the northwest sky from our backyard.  It was a white light, resembling a really bright star.  As we watched, it began to move erratically, up and down, back and forth, and was also blinking red and blue lights.  As we started looking around we noticed 2 more of the same objects, one in the west sky and one directly to the north.  the duration of each object varies from a few minutes to nearly an hour.  They get brighter before they start to blink colors, and then they start to fade and blink out slowly.  On one occasion I saw it eminate somthing like an aura of white light all around it in a large area around the object in a strobing or pulsing fashion.  This sighting is ongoing!!  We see them everynight after it gets dark.  Somtimes they will blink out only to reappear later on in the night and in a different location.  We live north of McClellan AFB and have had aircraft in the sky from there and Sacramento intl. during these sightings to compare to. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed to be quite sincere, and quite certain that she had witnessed something unusual.  We have invited her to check a star chart to establish whether the objects might have been twinkling stars.  There was another report from northern California for this date, I believe.
