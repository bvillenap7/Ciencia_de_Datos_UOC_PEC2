They look to be disc shaped or round.  They move around in different formations and then come together real close then drop away from each other again.  They stop in one spot for a little bit and then drop down or go upwards.  They are able to stop and go back in the direction they were coming from immediately.   They have been seen in the sky by four people in our neighborhood.   My question is, does anyone know what they are? ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly advertising lights?  PD));38.7213;-121.4478
