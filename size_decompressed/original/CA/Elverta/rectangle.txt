Large extremely fast moving object over Northern California on Thursday August 14th 2008.;2008-08-14 21:00:00;4 seconds;Large extremely fast moving object over Northern California on Thursday August 14th 2008. On the evening of Thursday August, 14th 2008 I saw and object appear in the sky to the North of my location out of the blue. It had two sets of orange lights and two sets of yellow lights, it was dark so I couldn't see the body just the lights. Normally I would have thought that this was a plane but it seemed to come out of nowhere and was traveling extremely fast at high altitude. I am a former U.S. Air Force Senior Airmen and I know planes very well I've been an avid aeronautics fans since I was very young and can tell the difference between an F-15 Eagle and F-14 Tomcat from very far away, (Subtle differences that the uninitiated wouldn't be able to discern).  At any rate this object appeared fairly brightly at first and then within seconds faded away while traveling at a high rate of speed even though it was very high up in the sky. The array of lights was such that it basically to on a sort of rectangle shape but that is solely based on the light configuration as I could not see the body since it was dark.  I often work outside my backyard at night and I'm always looking at the sky while lying on my back doing sit ups and resting often for at least 45 minutes a night. I'm very used to seeing satellites and shooting stars as well as all sorts of aircraft. This object was either an extremely large and fast top secret U.S. military aircraft with astonishing flight characteristics or an advanced vehicle from somewhere beyond our planet. Those are the only two possibilities in my mind. I'm curious if anyone else saw it but probably not due to it's extremely short duration in view, (Around 4 seconds tops).  Cheers;38.7213;-121.4478
