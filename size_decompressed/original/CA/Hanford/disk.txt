Daylight disk seen over Hanford, California;2001-09-30 14:25:00;7 - 10 seconds;Daylight disk seen over Hanford, California Object (1) seen directly overhead - just happened to look up (as an amateur pilot and airplane buff, I am interested in what happens in the sky) and saw a brilliant white object - for a moment, I thought it was a feather but quickly realized my error - the object was perfectly round, a little smaller than the full moon, with no fuselage, wings, empennage, or visible means of propulsion - it moved rapidly in a straight line SE toward Tulare and disappeared - the object made no sound (I can easily hear passenger jets flying overhead where I live) and no exhaust (vapor trails, etc.) was seen - I saw and heard a passenger jet flying northward just a few minutes later and easily made out the normal jet plane design (fuselage, wings, empennage) - it was much duller in appearance than the object - I have seen many meteors and a meteor it was not - I cannot say with any certainty how high the object was nor its true size but if I had to estimate I would say it was between 7500 and 10,000 feet - I tried to contact  FAT radar without success but did contact KSEE-TV to ask if anyone else had reported seeing the object but they did not have any additional sightings to report;36.3287230769231;-119.647261538462

Silver fat disk fading in and out with a  blueish tinge, very high speed , in a perfectly straight line n to s;2008-11-15 17:00:00;5 min;Silver fat disk fading in and out with a  blueish tinge, very high speed , in a perfectly straight line n to s Outside, clear blue sky with scattered clouds very high up.  Sunset was not for another two hours.  Walking out to my car, way outside the city limits, I looked up and observed a disk shaped object flying from north to south in a straight line almost directly above me and very high up but underneath the clouds that were there.  I was standing at the front of my car and before I had a chance to reach the truck of my car for my binoculars the object had flown out of my sight.  It did not veer off, but what caught my attention besides the speed was the fact that it was fading in and out, as to say it was there and then it wasn't and it continued that clear across until I lost sight of it.  I am fourteen miles from a Navy Air Base, and this was not one of their planes, nither was it a commercial flight as about five min. later I observed a commercial craft, that I could see clearly, flying from east to northwest and higher than the object I had observed.  The object was a silver color with a light blue tinge as it faded out and reappeared.  I have worked near air fields, at White Sands MB and am a retired police officer and have seen a lot of strange things.  This is just another one I tried to eliminate from other things I have seen.  Couldn't come up with an explaination on this one. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
