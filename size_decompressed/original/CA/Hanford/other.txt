Brightly colored silent craft moving right over houses and trees;2010-08-25 08:45:00;45 seconds;Brightly colored silent craft moving right over houses and trees I'm retired military.  I live in Hanford, Ca.   I went out to call the cat in and wondered if the moon was viewable.  I walked out to the pool and out of the corner of my left side I saw bright lights very low and slow.  There was no sound.  Bigger than an F-18 smaller than a 747.  It was weird.  The colors were weird. Blue ish purple, red, yellow and white.   I thought I was probably misidentifying a helo or plane but my house was in the middle of the horse shoe path it made.  I don't know what it was but it was very pretty and creepy at the same time like it had thoughts.  Anyway it went from my left neighbors house down to my back neighbor then arced up around my right neighbors house.  Very low and slow no sound.   I ran through to the front of the house and poof it was gone.  Very smooth. In the military, I do have witnesses to other things, but those looked different and I believe I've reported those.   Ok, we'll hope that helps anyone else that saw it.;36.3287230769231;-119.647261538462
