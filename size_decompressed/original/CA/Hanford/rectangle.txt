Rectangular ufo flies over residential  area near train tracks  in Hanford.;2015-06-23 22:26:00;5 seconds;Rectangular ufo flies over residential  area near train tracks  in Hanford. One summer night, I looked out my window and looked at the sky.  After a minute I saw a distortion in the  sky.  It was a black rectangular flying object that basses offer (sic.  passes over?) the house I was in.  The event only lasted seconds but I remember  the craft from the distance  from me looked like a large coffee  table.   After the craft left my sight, I saw nothing more than the stars.  While in sight the stars were all blocked out, as if there were none.  Craft just flew in a straight line.   During  the time I saw it, there were no animal sounds.   I have no idea how long I was looking  out the window.   The object  made no sound.;36.3287230769231;-119.647261538462
