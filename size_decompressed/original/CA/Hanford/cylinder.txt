Object appeared and disappeared (blinked in and out), no noise, no  colored lights, no wings.;2007-10-23 15:30:00;4 minutes;Object appeared and disappeared (blinked in and out), no noise, no  colored lights, no wings. Blue sky, near sunset.  Sparse clouds, high.  Object flew N. to S. down center of San Joaquin Valley about highth of regular airliner.  Object caught gleam of sunlight and turned silver as do other planes in similar situation.  Before I could get from the front of my car to the trunk area, the object had flown past going south down the valley at a very high rate of speed.  No colored lights as other aircraft.  Object was blinking off and on, I mean winking in and out, disappearing completly and back on again.  It appeared cylindirical but was very high up for me to get a good look without binoculars.  Area is frequented by regular airlines and we have Lemoore Naval Air base about 10 or 15 miles from that location.  I am familiar with their speed and appearance and that of regular aircraft.  This object was way faster that any jet I have observed or airliner.  I only saw one and there was no one in the area to show or to see it that I am aware of.  I work at a  tomato factory that is way out of town and can see the valley sky without any objects getting in the way.  I have seen objects before, but not for some time and just happen to be looking up.  There was no noise before or after the object passes overhead, and there is always noise from the jets and aircraft passing over.
