On 09/05/99 at approximately 22:30 hours in the city of Handord, Ca, which is approximatley 35 miles south of Fresno, Ca, While facing south I observed what appeared to be a round, green fireball about the size of a softball or larger, Traveling straight down, almost vertical, slightly pointed in an eastward direction. I observed it for approximately 5 seconds as it burned out and left a visible vapor trail.The fireball almost lasted long enough to pass below the roof of the house across the sreet.;36.3287230769231;-119.647261538462
Massive flash of light preceeding a large fireball falling to the earth;2005-11-05 23:45:00;1 min;Massive flash of light preceeding a large fireball falling to the earth I was travelling West on Hwy 198 just outside of Hanford CA when there was a bright flash of light that illuminated the entire atmosphere, similar to a flash of lightning only more intense.   I looked to the south which was where the flash was brightest to see a fireball falling in a straight line to the earth.   It was a large fireball, with the fire lasting approx. 20 seconds before burning out.   It seemed to be around 20-30 miles away.  Please tell me there are others who saw the same thing!;36.3287230769231;-119.647261538462
