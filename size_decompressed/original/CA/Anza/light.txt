High speed light, transvering horizon to horizon, NO trail or tail.;2000-03-16 17:15:00;less that 30sec.;High speed light, transvering horizon to horizon, NO trail or tail. AS we were driving towards Anza from, Hemet, Calif. I observed a soild white light about as intense as a regular 'landing' light. It moved at a very high speed from west to east, following a route that is commonly used by military aircraft when flying from the coastline to the Nevada Test site area. The craft moved at an incredible high rate of speed, making it from horizon to horizon in mere seconds. It did NOT exhibit the hallmarks of a Shooting Star or meteorite. There was no 'flaming' or trail behind it.I saw it start to finish.;33.5682;-116.7201
