Strange light seen within Sun-Ring.;2011-06-03 13:45:00;Unknown;Strange light seen within Sun-Ring While walking outside at my work, I noticed a very bright, distinct coronal ring around the sun.  My assistant was with me, and many people were outside looking at the sun as well.   It was too bright to look directly at the sun, so I grabbed my iPhone and held it straight up over my head and snapped several photos in a row.   I went inside to look at the photos, when my assistant and I saw that the photos had a foreign object in them....a bright light at the edge of the sun-ring.   There were no aircraft in the vicinity of the photo and none were overheard, as it was a quiet, clear day.   The light appeared to move from one photo to the next, although I cannot be sure that my hand was perfectly steady (since I did not use a tripod).   I looked up photos of other people who saw the coronal ring, but none that I saw had the light/possible object in them.   This might be perfectly explainable, but I would like to submit the photo for your scrutiny, just in case. ((NUFORC Note:  Seemingly high-quality photo shows small, round object in the vicinity of the Sun.  PD));34.6488;-120.1701
