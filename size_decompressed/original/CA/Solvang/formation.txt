Most nights of this Aug., and now this Sep.3, I have observed hovering quite stationary lights  (Each object has a line of four(?) white lights in a row.  They form a sweeping half circle in the South to West (sort of) over Solvang, Ca., at somewhat different altitudes and intensities of lights, but still looking kind of organized. This town is not many miles from Vandenberg AFB.  Once in Aug.  I very briefly saw a quick blink of a red light within one of the crafts in the usual four lights in a row on one of the crafts.  They are quite lovely I think. I only look up at them when I think of checking outside for them on some nights and they are usually there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.
