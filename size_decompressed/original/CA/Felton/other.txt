When looked with a binoculars it looked like an X the center had 4 lights, red green blue and white which rotated around the center. the object remained in one spot. Judging by the angle between my home and the horizon i would say the object was hovering in high altitude - between flight level 20 - 50.;37.0406;-122.066
