There were approximentaly 8 shiny objects.  It was flying over for about a minute or so before it dissaperd. My friend who was standing next to me saw the exact same thing. It was a perfectly clear afternoon. I saw two planes fly over as soon as the formation dissaperd. ((NUFORC Note:  We have altered the date above, in order to indicate a date in September.
