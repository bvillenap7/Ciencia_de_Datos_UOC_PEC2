Two bright lights moved in spurts then changed shape, color and direction.;2007-01-19 06:15:00;2 minutes;Two bright lights moved in spurts then changed shape, color and direction. My name is ((deleted)) and I work at the local ((private financial institution)).  I'd never seen anything unusual in the sky before today.   I was driving to work this morning when I noticed out of the corner of my eye a bright light at a little bit above the horizon line and off to the right of the direction I was facing.  I didn't pay much attention to it at first and just thought to myself that it was a big star.   When I looked at it a few seconds later I noticed that it was actually two lights signifigantly larger than the other stars and also that it seemed to be moving slowly, horizontally across the sky.   So then I thought it might be a plane.   I kept my eye on it and observed that it seemed to be moving slowly then pausing then moving again.  I thought it was wierd but still maybe a plane.   I was eager to arrive at work and park so I could get a good look at it.  I tried to keep my eye on it while I was driving and arrived at work about 45 seconds later.   When I got out of my car and looked up at the object(s) the two lights seemed to shift into a vertical position like stacked on top of each other and then I noticed a red blinking light between the two lights.   Then it started to move vertically straight down towards the ground.  I observed it for about thirty seconds while it slowly descended towards the ground and finally fell out of view behind a building.   It couldn't have been a plane because during the time that I was watching it, it moved in spurts then changed shape, color and direction   What the #%$&^!!!???
