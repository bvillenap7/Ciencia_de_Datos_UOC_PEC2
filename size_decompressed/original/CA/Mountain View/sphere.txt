The object was spherical in shape and appeared to be of metallic substance and reflectivity.I expected that this was an airplane and watched for it to turn, however after observing it for about one minute, I came to the conclusion that it was not going to turn.  It simply seemed to hover just east of Moffet fieldat an altitude of approximately 4-5000 feet.  After about 1 more minute, the object simply disappeared. While driving eastbound on Moffet Blvd from Mountain View towards Moffet field at 6:48p.m., I observed what I first thought to be an airplane.  The object was spherical in shape and appeared to be of metallic substance and reflectivity.I expected that this was an airplane and watched for it to turn, however after observing it for about one minute, I came to the conclusion that it was not going to turn.  It simply seemed to hover just east of Moffet fieldat an altitude of approximately 4-5000 feet.  After about 1 more minute, the object simply disappeared.  I looked around for any airplanes or other objects in the sky and found none.  The sky was blue, clear, and visibility of several miles.I then turned the radio to the news channel to listen for any news of anyone else observing such an article but heard nothing.It seemed appropriate to report this sighting in case anyone else happens to report a similar sighting.I would be happy to answer any further questions by email or phone.;37.3944816666668;-122.0819325
