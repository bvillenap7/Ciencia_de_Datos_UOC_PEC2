Slow moving disk emitting beams.;2009-02-17 23:50:00;5 minutes;Slow moving disk emitting beams. Both myself and my partner saw a small metallic disk no larger than a family car last night.  It rotated clockwise slowly and had 4 or 5 beams coming from the bottom of the UFO which were not very bright and were yellow in colour, but were bright enough to poorly illuminate an object.  The UFO was only a couple of hundred feet in the sky.  It moved at walking pace and looked like it had a dome on the top of the disk which was faintly illuminated red/pink. It made a quiet noise, similar to a jet engine, but much quieter.  As well as the beams of light it had what looked like green glow-sticks on the rim of the disk. We saw the UFO slowly move away towards the coast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.3944816666668;-122.0819325
