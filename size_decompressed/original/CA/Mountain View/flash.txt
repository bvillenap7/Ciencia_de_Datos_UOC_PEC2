very sharp, very bright, intense green light - moved like a meteor;2002-03-18 22:00:00;1.5 secs;very sharp, very bright, intense green light - moved like a meteor We saw a flash of green light build in intensity in one spot of the night sky, then accelerate down towards the horizon at incredible speed.  the motion appeared to be like a meteor, however there was no trail whatsoever, and being within the city, it was so very sharp and clear that it appeared to be closer than it probably was.  I have seen falling stars before - i spent 4 hours watching the leonids last year, but  never did i see something that looked this big and was this sharp.  it was just so uncharacteristic, it's visual appearance was like a flare, but there was no way it could have been one the way it moved.  It appeared in the southeastern sky from our position. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a date in 2001, but we believe he meant 2002, based on our telephone conversation with him.  We have amended the date here.  PD));37.3944816666668;-122.0819325
