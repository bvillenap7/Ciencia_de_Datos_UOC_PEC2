Disappeared after about 3 seconds. Did not seem to be burning like an ordinary object coming throught the atmosphere or leaving a sparking trail of burning debris, there was no flair, instead appeared to have a uniform faint red trail as if a light was quickly moving.;37.3944816666668;-122.0819325
Three strange groups of erratically moving orange points of light move north over the califonia sky.;2007-10-06 21:00:00;25 seconds;Three strange groups of erratically moving orange points of light move north over the califonia sky. While in creek at around 21:00 on November 6, I noticed two lines of light travelling north from the southern sky. These lights were dim when first spotted and looked like a flock of birds. The lights then broke from the two line formations and formed two groups of errtacally moving balls of light. Being almost directly overhead they were brighter and more distinct, being orange red in color. I would estimate that each group of lights were numbered at 15 to 25.I yelled at my friend to come see,and he did see the lights just before they disappeared. I was ecstatic, and running to tell my other friend who was down the way I spotted another group of lights. This one group appered approximately ten min. after the first two groups were seen.This last group was identical to the first, travelling the same direction, but located more east and not overhead. This last sighting was visable only for a few seconds. The first two were seen for about 20 seconds.;37.3944816666668;-122.0819325
White Light Moving Object Seen over Mountain View/Sunnyvale CA area;2011-06-20 22:00:00;10 minutes;White Light Moving Object Seen over Mountain View/Sunnyvale CA area White-lit object appeared to be one of the stars on this clear, cloudless night, but then seemed to be moving rather rapidly with respect to the actual, stationary stars, in an eastward direction. Light intensity seemed to shift from dim to bright and back again, as it progressed along its path.  Object did not display typical aircraft red/green wing lighting, only white pulsing light.;37.3944816666668;-122.0819325
Formation over Mountain View CA;2015-10-13 20:00:00;2-3 hours;Formation over Mountain View CA A few friends and I went to a show at Shoreline Ampitheater in Mountain View.  We first noticed 2 lights in the sky that looked a little off.  I kept looking back at them throughout the night.  They would disappear and reappear.  I saw what I thought was a plan going towards the lights.  The lights that I thought was a plane separated and bounced off each other before coming back together and flying off in the direction it came.  This happened several different times.   My friends and I watched as suddenly a 3rd bright light appeared.  Within 5 minutes, a 4th appeared. I snapped a picture of them.  They were stationary for about 20 minutes when one slowly flew away, then the next one, and the next one and finally the 4th one flew away.  Very interesting.  On our way to the parking lot after the show, we also saw what appeared to be an asteroid strike across the sky with brilliant blue and green lights in the tail.;37.3944816666668;-122.0819325
Light near moon slowly move away from it;2018-12-18 16:35:00;5-7 minutes;Light near moon slowly move away from it While driving car on San Antonio Rd, Mountain View, CA, I saw a star very near moon.  It was just north west side.  Since it was day time and being bright near moon and never see a star like that near moon, I was amazed and so showed it to my daughter and my wife.  My wife could not see it first, so we were pointing her to the direction to look we realized it was slowly faring away from moon, that made us very much amazed and we were constantly watching it without even taking our eyes from it.  About 5 to 7 minutes time it reached 1 to 1.5 meters away from moon, then disappeared all of a sudden.;37.3944816666668;-122.0819325
