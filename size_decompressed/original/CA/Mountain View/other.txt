The sighting may have been seen throughout California.  This was a launch from Vandenberg AFB and NOT a UFO.  You may already have information on this launch, but I thought that this may be of assistance in case you did not know of the launch.  See below... I do not know if the launch was announced--I do know that there was no mention of it on any of the networks or radio stations, from what I could tell--but it occured between 9:55 and 10:00pm.  It was seen as a typical rocket flame for approximately 2 minutes.  When stage one completed burn, it became a red dot in the southern sky.  This lasted for approximately 1 minute, and faded from view. If you were unaware of this, I hope it helps with any reports that you may receive today.;37.3944816666668;-122.0819325
Huge irregular craft slowly moving from west to east over the San Francisco Bay Area.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2005-11-03 17:00:00;90 seconds;Huge irregular craft slowly moving from west to east over the San Francisco Bay Area. This was a large craft that looked like it was easily the size of three jumbo jets.   It wobbled as it moved West to East across the sky. It was a dark metallic brown and black craft which reflected the fading sunlight.  The base was round with two small spikey pertrudances jutting from the side of the base opposite of one another.  Atop the base was a slanted dome that from afar looked as if it had a superstructure that looked as if it were made of wire-mesh, resulting in a cross-hatched pattern.  It travelled in the same direction that the dome was slanted in.  When I saw it, it wobbled for about ten second, moving slowly across the sky, before it quickly picked up speed and flew away, becoming smaller and smaller before it became a tiny dot, when it flew out of sight.  This craft conforms to no pictures or descriptions that I have personally seen or heard of. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  We do not know whether this is intended to be a serious report.
