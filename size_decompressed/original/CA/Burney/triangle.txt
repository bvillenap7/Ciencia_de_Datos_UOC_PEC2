Thousands of strange objects streaking across the night sky;2005-12-02 19:30:00;45 minutes;Thousands of strange objects streaking across the night sky We observed objects comming from the north and moving southward and sometimes changing to a path of south west. They appeared to be in groups of 20-30. They started comming out of the north in a horizontal line to somewhat of a v shape and looked like groups of moving stars. We saw several passenger jet move across the sky while we were watching the objects and judging from the speed of a jet these objects were going 8-10 times faster than the jets. I got out my binoculars and looked at them as they came over and they had a bird like or plane like shape. In the binoculars they looked slightly illuminated or white. These groups came one after another for at least 45 minutes that we watched. I have lived here for 50 years and I have never seen anything like this in the sky. I dont believe these were birds on migration because there were too many of them and there was no sound. Also as I was watching one group approach one of the objects fell from the formation and had the appearance of a meteorite except it fell much slower.If anyone can tell me what this was please let me know.
