Formation of 3 flying orbs over the skys of burney california.;2003-06-09 03:50:00;10 mins;Formation of 3 flying orbs over the skys of burney california. The objects were travelling toward the direction of my apartment in a formation of 3 with 2 side by side at the front and the other trailing below and to the left of the others.at first we just thought they were stars,but the stars around them were not moving.they were extremely high,maybe,even outside of earths atmosphere and they were flying in perfect sync. with each other until they reached almost over our heads,then they all turned left (keeping perfect formation) and disappeared out of sight.all was quiet at that time of the morning and we heard no sounds from the objects.;40.8957;-121.6603
