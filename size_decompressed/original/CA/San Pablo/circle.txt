bright moon sized object appeared to be over hills in Marin county as seen from Contra Costa County, Ca;2001-07-01 02:45:00;few seconds;bright moon sized object appeared to be over hills in Marin county as seen from Contra Costa County, Ca I was setting at my computer at approximately 2:45 am. The only light on in the house was in the room I was in, a ceiling light. The window above my desk faces west and I often look up at the window. The view includes the hills in Marin County as seen from near San Pablo bay in Contra Costa County.  I looked up and saw what appeared to be a golden harvest moon, it gave off enough light to see the hills below it.  My impression was that it was the moon, but there was something off about it.  I commented in an IM that there was either a beautiful full moon or a UFO outside of my window.  It probably took me less than 30 seconds to type that and when I looked up again it was gone. I went outside and the sky was clear with stars clearly visable but I could not see the moon from my yard.  The object was moon sized but it didn't have the face in the moon, was more yellow than golden and seemed sort of speckled.  There are no street lights visible from my window and nothing in the house that could have been reflecting.  I don't know what this was but it was very strange.;37.9760000000001;-122.3359
