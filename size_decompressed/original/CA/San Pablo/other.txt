Light coming out of cloud I thought was a helicopter with spot light behind a cloud. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:15:00;3 minutes;Saw a light coming out of cloud I thought was a helicopter with spot light behind a cloud. Then as it passed it was just a bright ball then as it went into the sky it looked like an eclipse as it moved away it ascended  in a path from East to west at a seep incline.  I was yelling for my 2 friends who were inside they did not respond until the object was past but we're clearly able to see it on the ascent when it looked like an eclipse.   It also left a mark that looked liked when you blow thru smoke. There was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.

Looked as if it were a satellite until it lit up like a bright light until the plane passed.
