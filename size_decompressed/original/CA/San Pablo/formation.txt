I was going next door to give my girl friend the phone. A helicopter seemed to be flying out of the area when I looked east over the hill and I saw what looked like three bright lights forming a triangle directly above the hill. The lights were bright and they seemed to be rising in the sky. I called people from inside my house and next door to come look, that is when one after another the lights began to break off and fly west towards the coast. Once they fly over the population it seemed the lights went out and red and blue lights replaced them with white flashing ones. They were able to stop on a dime and change direction and made no noise and we hear helicopters and planes just fine. After three of the lights did this then hovered lingered and crossed over and under one another out at the coast, three more came over the hill. This continued for almost an hour. I have no idea what I saw, I know that where I live does not have nearly as much air traffic as was going on that night. We got some video but it was taken with a shaken hand. After all the lights flew out to the coast that was the end of the nightâ€™s excitement. I did not have any binoculars only a Sony cybershot camera.;37.9760000000001;-122.3359
