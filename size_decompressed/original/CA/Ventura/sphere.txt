UFO seen shining bright light onto a jail;2002-05-21 02:30:00;15 minutes;UFO seen shining bright light onto a jail I work the night shift as a security guard at a local jail along with three other men.  Last night, May 21, at approximately 2:30 am I took a 15-minute break from guarding.  I usually just go down to the cafeteria and grab a cup of coffee but that night I noticed the hallway door had been open to the outside.  This was rather strange because the doors in the hallway were always kept shut to make sure no prisoners tried to escape.  The hallway was pitch black as I walked towards the door, and just as I went to grab my flashlight a bright beam came shining through the open door.  I rushed over to try to find the source of the light.  As I got to the doorway I looked up to the sky and I noticed a large craft hovering above me.  My breath was taken away instantly and a rush of fear came over me. I tried to call for the other guards to come and check out the scene but no words would come from my mouth.  I was speechless.  The large craft swayed back and forth through the air, still with its light beam shining bright.  There were no windows on the craft so I could not see any activity inside.  As the thought came to me to run and grab a video camera, my feet grew heavy and unmovable.  I just stood there, stunned, for a good 5 minutes until the bright light turned dull and the craft shot straight up into the air and out of sight. Never in my life have I experimented with hallucinogens or any other drugs.  I had not been drinking alcohol the night of May 21 and I was not the slightest bit drowsy.  The chances of sightings like this may be one in a million, but I firmly believe now that there are other life forms out there.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
2 cotton balls of light on same course moving quickly East to West;2005-09-30 20:52:00;5-8 seconds;2 cotton balls of light on same course moving quickly East to West I observed 2 balls of light, like a lightly illuminated cotton ball, moving very rapidly east to west in a mostly straight line with a slight course change, it was remarkable how the objects imitated one another during the course change as it did seem through paralax that the objects were indeed separate and not a reflection or refraction of one another.   I was looking South/Southwest when I observed the objects moving from the East passing just under the main body of the constellation Aquila and passing through the constellations tail section.  No noise was heard.  No paranormal or abnormal phenomenom was/were associatated with the event. The light emitted was nothing spectacular, no colors, no dimming, a very pale white light.  Apparently, the objects were about the size of a dime at arms length(1/2-1 degree).  Distance and actual size of the object is very difficult to determine as object had no discernable features, however my best guess as to distance would be from 500' to maybe 2 miles tops.  This event was immediately recorded with time, date, direction, and location being absolute. I've been an amateur astronomer for five years, and have never seen anything quite like that!;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Flashing orb;2007-01-08 17:25:00;3 to 5 min;Flashing orb I watched a blinking orb shaped object hanging above some hills here in Ventura last night.  I kept telling myself it was just an airplane with blinking light, but the light was too big (was the entire object) traveling slowly south east and the kicker was when it just disappeared while I was watching it. One second it was there and the next it was gone like it just turned off.  Not a very exciting viewing, but it was a clear evening (actually just before sun down) and it was there for 3 to 5 minutes, the blinking was at an unusual rate compared to the little ones you see on airplanes.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Star looking object with rotating light (lighthouse) changed directions and speed.;2018-11-14 17:20:00;45 seconds;Ventura, CA.  Star looking object with rotating light (lighthouse) changed directions and speed I was night sky watching with my Generation 3 goggles.  As usual I see aircraft and several satellites and sometimes something I can't explain. Then a bright star looking object appeared from northwest moving southeast at a speed slower than commercial aircraft, and a height of approximately 4000 feet.  The object had a slow rotating light like a lighthouse.  I watched for approximately fifteen seconds then the object changed directions heading upward. I watched the object climb at a faster speed over the next thirty seconds with the slow rotating light until it was out of sight.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
