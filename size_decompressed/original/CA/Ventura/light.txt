Four white lights perfectly aligned and moving horizontally.;1999-04-18 23:00:00;20-30 minutes;Four white lights perfectly aligned and moving horizontally. When first viewed, 4 white lights (approximately the brightness of stars) with a dimmer red blinking light between the 2 center lights, were moving slowly north. They would stop then move laterally for a few seconds. They would again move forward, then hover, and move sideways. I went inside to get my binoculars, and to dress warmer, when I returned some 8-10 minutes later, the 2 outside lights had moved. One out of my sight, the other was closer to me and very close to the horizon. It had gotten very bright. A minute or so later, this light moved vertically at a high velocity and stopped instantly. It appeared higher than the two remaining lights (with the red between) which seemed farther off too. I estimate the elevation to be about 5,000 ft, if so the light that shot vertically was travelling around 700 mph. They all eventually moved south and lower until they were out of my sight. I don't think these lights were helicopters, airplanes, or stars (I compared the lights positions to other objects in the night sky including stars and trees). So what is left? Was this one object with four parts, or four objects anchored together at first?;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089

It seemed to just float around for about 10 min then moved south behind a fog bank and out of sight. At 4:00am I stopped on my way to work down by the beach which I do every day. I stop at the same place. So when I stopped today I noticed a new light over the Islands which I had'nt seen before. As I watched it I felt as if I was no longer alone, I felt as if there were other people with me watching what I was watching. It was completly dark around me so I couldnt see very far away but it was as if the were shadows of people around me. I cant describe it. I watched the light for about five minutes when it began to move. It moved back and forth like a pendulum. It move like it was floating it move in all direction up, down around it didnt appear to have any real direction for about 10 minutes. The lights color seemed to change from white to blue. I watched the light until it went behind a fog bank out of sight. During this whole time I had the chills and goose bump all over yet I was quit warm. I dont know what I saw but I was hopping that someone else might of seem the same thing I did.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Light moving in the sky then dissappears;2002-05-25 22:04:00;about 15 seconds;Light moving in the sky then dissappears I had just come home from my peer leader meeting from my church when i happened to look up into the sky on the way up my front lawn. I looked up toward the west and say a light moving across the sky(south). It moved about 45 degrees then stopped then moved about another 65 back the opposite direction. It then took off upward at a great rate of speed and dissappeared. I  was not on any drugs or alcohol and was not tired or sleepless.

Bright starlike red light in night sky that travelled vertically, slowly leaving a small red trail before disintegrating.;2005-08-29 20:05:00;1.5 minutes;Bright starlike red light in night sky that travelled vertically, slowly leaving a small red trail before disintegrating. One bright red starlike light observed looking in the western night sky toward the ocean.  The red light object dropped vertically, slowly, and left a small red trail and just disappeared.  My daughter and I watched it together and she said Oh! it is a helicopter and when it just disintegrated we both knew it wasn't.  I am a photographer and have never seen anything like this before.  My daughter is a teenager.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Dark spherical shape glowing brilliant lime-green, leaving a glowing green trail.;2006-12-23 23:00:00;3 seconds;dark spherical shape glowing brilliant lime-green, leaving a glowing green trail I was driving south on Hwy 101 toward Ventura California, less than 45 miles to the city limits.  I was with my boyfriend, but he was asleep in the passenger seat.  I saw a brilliant lime-green light that streaked in an absolute vertical path (I am an artist, and very good at drawing, so I am very clear about vertical and horizontal alignment - this was a straight vertical) which was visible from the upper part of the windshield down more than halfway to the horizon.  My line of sight was clear in front of me, mountainous to my left side, and ocean on my right. The road runs right on the coast in this area.  I first assumed that it was a comet or shooting star, but I have never seen one like that before, and another quality was that the actual object was glowing that brilliant lime-green color, which I have never heard of in a comet.  It left a long green glowing tail the full length that I could see it and contiued to glow for another second or two.  The most unusual aspect was that it seemed as though it was a spherical object that was itself dark in color, but was 'glowing' all the way around it, because the object seemed to look like the color 'thinned' toward the center, and was extremely vivid at the edges, like it was producing the light as an aura or emission, it appeared like a green corona. I definitely saw darkening in the center and made mental note of it.  I can't estimate the size but it seemed much larger than any shooting star I have seen. I have observed meteor showers, and never seen anything that is similar.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
I saw a red and white flashing object that moved in any way other than a straight line, and I think it noticed me.;2010-05-27 22:15:00;10 minutes;I saw a red and white flashing object that moved in any way other than a straight line, and I think it noticed me. Before I tell you what I saw, or what, at least, that I can remember of what I saw on May 27th, 2010, a short while after 10:00 p.m, latest being 10:20 p.m., I want to let you know that until recently I was a total skeptic.  Before all this chit-chat about ancient aliens and ufos started on t.v. and what not, I thought, Okay, well, I agree that it's a possibility that there are other life forms out there, but I disagree that they have visited us.  Then came all the ufo hunters and t.v. series that have sparked an intriguement inside me. So, now let me describe my sighting to you. Okay, I'm walking my boyfriend to the top of my street from where he will skateboard home, we say our goodbyes and depart.  About this time everything is seemingly normal.  As I'm walking, being a nature lover that I am, I'm looking towards the sky.  And I thought, Wouldn't it be crazy if I saw a ufo tonight? Walking home and I see one, yea right hahah sort of joking about in my head. Well, a few minutes later I notice something that first I thought was a star.  However, it had a white and red flashing light system.  The object would glow a dim red, and then a bright white, and then back to the dim red and then back to the bright white, like a strobe light, then I thought that's strange, so I stopped walking.  And that's when I noticed that this object was moving in abrupt directions, such as zig zagging, but this object was very far away so I could only see it move just a little bit everytime it did so. It was only a little light in the sky flashing a dim red and then a brighter white and moving in every other way I can think of asides a straight line.  Okay, here's where things get even a little more funky, so I've stopped and I'm looking at this light in the sky and I think Oh well, there must be some logical explanation for it.  So I keep walking, not a block away from my apartment, I turn my head to face in front of me and I noticed that far away up in the sky, is ANOTHER one of these flashing lights, still red and white, so I look back at the spot that my eyes had just previously left and sure enough the same one is still there.  I felt a bit frightened at this point and hurried into my home through the back door because I felt that it hid the view from those points of mysterious light, from what might've been aliens.  Now there is one critical detail that I have left out, and that is that while I was walking, the light that I was watching, moved from in front of me ! to behind me.  It was originally ahead of me and off to my right, then it moved to behind me and off to my right, had I turned around and faced it, it would have been on my left.  I cannot explain it any better than that. In one or two sentences, I was walking home the other night and noticed two objects that were distant from each other in the sky yet had the same flight patterns and dual red/whtie light systems that were definitively not airplanes and not helicopters.  There was no sound, it was as simple as this, when I laid my eyes on it I knew it was something I had never seen before, and it frightened me.  I've seen video recordings of such orbs of changing light and the best way I can tell you what it was, is a red and white ufo like all the other ufos glowing a bright white light and some other color.  I'm saying that it is a possible UFO abduction case because soon after I went to bed, they might've beamed me up late at night.  Also my boyfriend had a dream about me being abducted by aliens.  And when I think back to that night, things always get a little blurry, and everything that I said to you I remember with specific detail.  When it comes down to it, I think I might propose that! aliens are trying to make me forget, but I'm holding onto it, almost like when you try to remember what you dreamed last night, and you can remember those bits and pieces of imagery but not the whole scenario.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Blue/red light seen 'dancing' above Ventura, CA;2012-01-12 18:00:00;6 minutes;Blue/red light seen 'dancing' above Ventura, CA While walking back to my car after visiting the bank, my girlfriend pointed out a light in the night sky, noting that it was unusual.  I looked up and saw a purple-colored light in the sky, heading away from us.  I commented that it was strange, as usually airplane lights are red or white, but didn't think very much of it.  A couple moments later, as we arrived back at my car, I looked up again at the object and saw that in the 30 seconds since it was last observed it had completely reversed direction and was heading vaguely towards us. Realizing that this light may actually be queer, we stopped to observe it.  As it got closer, I noticed that the light was not purple, but was made up of both blue and red lights.  The center of the object was a series of red lights, arranged horizontally.  Above and below the red lights were blue lights that almost looked halo-like. It was the sandwiching of these lights that initially made the object appear purple. As we watched, the object stopped moving towards us and began moving in circular motions.  The lights continually faded in and out while this was happening.  Its movement was not confined to simple circles, and was fairly erratic.  It would circle around in one direction, then stop, then rise up again and then seem to appear in another spot when its lights faded back in.  At one point, the entire object tilted on its side and seemed to dive towards the ground, only to reappear higher up again. We observed the object for around 6 minutes before it began moving away from us, towards the beach.  We decided to try to follow it, but we couldn't find it again after we left the parking lot.  We went to the beach to see if maybe it had made its way out to sea, but it did not show itself again.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089

I was sitting on my couch in my living room looking south out our large two story window. The sky was still dark but starting to lighten up. I noticed a very bright star.  As I looked at this bright star the light from the star went out.  It then appeared half the size and a little to the left.  It also then went out. I sat there for several minute but never saw the light again. I am a female engineer in my mid-thirties.

Star formation with controlled movements seen with naked eyes.;2012-10-27 20:00:00;25;Star formation with controlled movements seen with naked eyes. Walking on the Ventura Pier last night about 8:00 P.M. with my girl friend Rosa.  Sky was clear with many stars of different brightness seen.  I saw two stars that were moving faster than the surrounding field of stars so I thought they were satellites in a tandem orbit coming from the horizon just over Anacapa Island from Ventura Pier.  I watched this formation of two objects spread about 5 degrees apart in the sky without any odd move ments.   Suddenly a flare came out of the top star and it moved quickly across and stopped with an opposite thrust.  Flares appeared to be larger that the light.  At first my girl friend could not see them but when it flashed again she said holy shit was is that?  They were amazing to see. They showed intelligent calculated movements. I was thinking it was the Dragon Spacex Moving away from the space station but with the naked eye seeing thrusters, no way.  I have seen the space station before while at the beach but it was muc! h brighter.  Any thoughts?  Total observation time about 25 mins before they disappeared at Zenith or straight up.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Strange light above Oxnard and Ventura tonight;2013-04-16 20:40:00;3 minutes;Strange light above Oxnard and Ventura tonight Red light that resembled a falling star fell to the horizon but straight down and much faster. It took on a purple glow around the red and then did a few quick loops, flew in a straight line very fast even with the horizon and then back a ways did another loop.  Flew straight up, straight back down, stayed down ground level, came straight back up and then another loop.  After that it faded into a light purple color, sat still right above the visible horizon, turned from the purple to orange and faded away completely.

Just prior to reaching the Kimball exit, we both observed a very bright light suddenly appear in the sky over Saticoy or maybe Santa Paula.  We both watched it as it began to move toward the ground.  Our first impression was that it may have been a meteor but then it began to emit a blue light and increase speed rapidly before turning to an orange glow and then disappearing below the treeline.
