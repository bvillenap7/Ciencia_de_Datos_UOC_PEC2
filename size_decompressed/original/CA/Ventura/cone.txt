On the night of May 17, 2002, at 23:45 hours an unidentified object floated, and seemed to stay stationary, in the western sky on the 126 freeway. I was driving home with my co-worker one late night and witnessed a strange object just floating over the road in front of us. It was about 100 yards away and had a reddish tint to it with orange and yellow lights pouring out of its cone shape. It just hovered there so we decided to pull over.  And when we turned off the car we heard a noise that sounded like a radio station frequency that wouldn't come in. We waited there and after about 10 or 15 minutes the objects lights got really bright, almost so you couldn't look directly at it, and then it just went black and it was gone. All that was left was a smokey trail that the object had left behind. I want everyone to know that I was under no drugs or alcohol of any kind, and what we both saw was true to life and should be investigated.

The reports seemed to us to be not convincing at the time of the call, a fact which we shared with the callers.  Shortly afterwards, approximately a dozen reports were submitted from that area.  We have no way of confirming any of these reports.  PD));34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
It was amazing;2002-05-20 21:00:00;1 hour;It was amazing I was working at my part time job at McDonalds located in Ventura and it was a regular busy night. Every night I have to take the trash out to the big trash bins around 9:30 p.m. These trash bins are across the parking lot of the shopping center so it is quite a walk for me. It was May 20, 2002 and it was a dark night. When I went out to put the trash out I spotted lights flashing across the sky like the search lights that you sometimes see for airplane landings. These did not look like searching lights but I ignored them and went back to doing my job because I was getting off early. A while later I was pulling out of my job and I saw the lights again. They were flashing now up on the hills of Ventura up by the two trees. I drove closer but all I could see were the bright green lights. Then I heard a huge noise like a door was slamming but not a regular door, like a metal door. After the loud noise the lights disappeared and there was wind surfacing my car. Since I had the windows down it blew throughout my car and then everything stopped like nothing had happened. I am reporting this as a UFO sighting because I donâ€™t know what else it could be. I could barley make out what it was but it looked to resemble a cone shaped object.
