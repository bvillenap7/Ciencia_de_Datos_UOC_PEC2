V shaped  soundless aircraft;2007-06-22 21:40:00;4 seconds;V shaped  soundless aircraft While standing on my patio I saw a V shaped set of lights pass by an an un-determinable altitude pass by and disappear in about 4 seconds after I noticed it. There was no wind and visibility was extreme clear. There were stars out in the background nothing in the sky that would obscure visibility. There were also a few dissapating Con Trails at higher altitudes. The best description I can offer is that it looked very much like the image I found depicted on the top of this page.  It was a V shaped set of low intensity lights with 1 at the point, and 4 or 5 on each leg of a symmetrical shaped V. It disapeared after about 4 seconds which was not obscured by any ground objects or the horizon.  What confused me is that there was no sound, and that there was plenty of background light which would provide a view of the vehicle the lights were a part of, and there was nothing. It was simply a formation of low intensity lights, shaped in an angle that no aircraft (commercial or military) I know of.  For the record... I'm not a believer in extra terrestial life or aliens from another planet. I've also seen plenty of waterfowl formations at night and can assure you that idea has no merit in my opinion.   I would be more apt to chalk it up to a secret reconnasiance type of craft that has not been made public yet. Stranger things have happened.....;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
four illuminated chevrons that appeared to be made up of several pieces - similar to birds flying together. Ventura, CA;2008-05-24 21:40:00;15 minutes;four illuminated chevrons that appeared to be made up of several pieces - similar to birds flying together. Ventura, CA First witness statement This began at approximately 9:40 p.m. I was sitting with my husband in our hot tub and happened to glance to the sky.  I did not look directly up, but just raised my eyes slightly and looked toward the Northeast.  I noticed a chevron-shape flying across the sky.  I thought it was birds because of the formation, and because it looked like there were independent objects creating the formation.  But it was dark outside…and unless they were iridescent birds that happened to be getting a reflection from the moon, I don’t know how they would be lit up.  I said to my husband, “What is that?  Birds, or a UFO?”  I said it very casually, because I really didn’t know WHAT I was seeing.  He said, “Maybe it’s a B2 bomber running a test,” (as we have military bases around and sometimes do see this type of thing.  But we didn’t really see lights, just simply illumination.  Then, he said that it was moving much too quickly to be an aircraft.  A few seconds later, while we were still wondering what we saw, there was another one.  This was appeared to fly in the same flight path of the first, but its shape was slightly different.  It was more of a flattened chevron, while the first was a very triangular shape.  These both flew in the direction from the West to the East.  Within what seemed like a minute, but I don’t know for sure as there is not a lighted clock outside, a helicopter flew by.  The helicopter also looked like it was flying in the same flight path, although it may have been lower.  It was definitely slower and noisy, whereas the first two objects were silent.  About eight minutes later, we saw another one.  This one looked farther away to me, and it flew from the Northeast toward the Southwest.  This one seemed more like the first in its shape.  We saw this one for what seemed like a longer time – maybe a total of 15-20 seconds.  Approximately five minutes after that, we saw another one.  This one also flew from the West to the East and we were able to see it for about 12-15 seconds.  While we were staring at the sky trying to figure out what we saw, or see more, or who knows what, we saw several regular aircraft.  They all moved a lot slower than what we saw.  We also saw some satellites that appeared to be moving fairly quickly.  However, because of their blinking, it is hard to determine how fast they were moving compared to blinking.   Second witness statement: On the night of May 24, 2008 at approximately 9:40 pm, my wife and I were relaxing in our hot tub, looking up at the sky in Ventura, CA.  Suddenly, my wife said, What is that? and I looked up and saw a chevron shaped 'thing' flying through the sky. We live near the coast in Southern California, so the 'thing' was coming from the ocean, moving west to east. It was moving very quickly, faster than conventional aircraft that we see regularly in our area. The 'thing' was in the shape of a 'V', or a chevron and was made up of single lights or dots, probably 8 in total.  About a minute after seeing the object, another identical object moved across the sky in the same direction, following the direction of the first object.  It looked identical and was moving along the same direction. We heard no sound and saw no conventional contrails from aircraft which appear to be at a similar altitude.  Approximately 5 minutes later, we both saw another identical object moving across the sky from the North to the South.  It appeared to be the same shape and moving the same speed as the previous 'things.'    We sat and pondered what the objects were for approximately 10 minutes when another 'thing' flew through the sky along the same path and at the same rate as the first and second 'things.  We continued to look into the sky for an additional 15 minutes or so and did not see anything else that resembled the first sighting.  The objects appeared to be moving at a higher rate of speed than conventional aircraft, and were completely silent in their movement.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
A slow rising black boomerang shaped object, it had no trail and no lights.;2009-01-04 17:00:00;20 minutes;A slow rising black boomerang shaped object, it had no trail and no lights. Two others and I were at a golf course hitting range.  After hitting multiple shots off into the distance one of my friends saw a black object at what seemed like the height and distance of a cell tower.  Observing it for several minutes, it started moving up words.  Once high enough we were able to see the bottom and the shape of the object, which was like a boomerang.  The craft had no lights and no trail.  It continued to rise at a slow but consistent pace.  Another man, an employee of the course asked us what we were looking at.  Unable to define what it might be he went to retrieve a pair of binoculars.  Returning soon, the employee and the three of us could not quite get a clean look with the binoculars.  \ The sun began to set and the object was soon out of sight. I can be contacted if needed.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
I saw a huge very black chevron shaped craft, with lights like steady stars, heading NNW out of Ventura CA towards Ojai.;2009-11-25 22:45:00;6 seconds;I saw a huge very black chevron shaped craft, with lights like steady stars, heading NNW out of Ventura CA towards Ojai. My friend and I were heading out to her back yard, she was putting something in the trash, and I was going to have a cigarette. I live in LA and am unaccustomed to so many stars.  It was an especially clear night, and I was staring up to the sky. While she was putting her bag into the trash bin, I saw, near our visual horizon (the actual horizon was blocked by the garage and trees) what must have been a huge, chevron shaped craft.  Though i can't know for sure, it seemed like it would have been wider than a 747.  It was black, blacker than the night sky, almost felt like a shadow on the sky.  There were 6 lights, which looked exactly like stars of a medium intensity, one at the tip of the chevron/v shape, two others running along the sides and one at the inner apex of the V. It moved so quickly, and completely soundlessly that had I seen a video of it i would have laughed at how computer animated it looked. I gasped and said ________ Oh my God, its a UFO by the time I turned her around to look at it, it was already almost over our visual horizon, and she didn't see it in time.  It was heading NNW towards Ojai.  In almost no time at all it was gone. In all, I couldn't have seen it for even 6 seconds, but it was very! very clear what I was seeing.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Beautiful bright blue delta shaped aerobatics.;2012-09-09 20:30:00;15 minutes;Beautiful bright blue delta shaped aerobatics. Delta shaped wing with blue neon on each side, flying in aerobatic style over the ocean.  Estimated altitude 5000 feet.  Occasionally changed to red, but mostly neon blue.

Flying wing like shape flew quietly overhead.;2018-08-11 00:29:00;5-6 seconds;Flying wing like shape flew quietly overhead. I was sitting on my balcony looking toward the southwest when an object caught my attention.  At first it looked like a bird (seagull) flying above the buildings across the street, then the object came closer.  Looking up at the object, it looked similar to a B-1 like shape. It had what appeared to be three (3) disc shaped lights (?) on the bottom side.  Completely silent and moving fairly fast.  Conditions were very clear skies, with object moving from South to North.  I lost visual of object as my building then obstructed my view.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Chevron shaped object flying high west to east Ventura, CA.;2019-05-02 21:20:00;5 seconds;Chevron shaped object flying high west to east Ventura, CA. On Thursday at approximately 9:20PM I was in my backyard Jacuzzi.  I am a 56 year old male, no drink or drugs.  My wife of 50 years old and her friend also in Jacuzzi saw the same thing.  They had drunk one glass of wine each.  Dark outside no moon up yet.   My wife was looking up and said what the hell is that.  I looked up along with the third witness and saw what appeared to be a large chevron-shaped object quite high up moving straight and fairly high speed.  There was no sound.   I watched it move across the sky towards Los Angeles for about 5 seconds.  There appeared to be very faint white lights single and dull on constantly along the shape which allowed one to notice the v shape.  No strobe,  No other lights.  Very odd and I have no idea.  We see jets flying very high all the time north to south and vice versa, so we are familiar with the sounds and lights of aircraft.  No drone engine sound either.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
