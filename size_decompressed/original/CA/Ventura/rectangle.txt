Long white rectangular object seen over Ventura, CA.;2001-08-19 11:00:00;10 seconds;Long white rectangular object seen over Ventura, CA. My wife was driving and we were headed north on Highway 101 along the ocean. Just as we were entering Ventura, I looked up in a kind of north westerly direction and saw a long white rectangular object heading slowly east.  I thought that it might have been an airplane but the length and width of it were not consistent with either a jet or a small winged plane.  That's why I kept watching it. As it was moving east, it kind of dipped on the right side and disappeared. I looked all over the sky where it had been but could not find it.  I tried to rationalize that it might have gone in to some haze along the ocean, but as we continued north, there was some haze but not enough to cover the size of the object. When I say long white narrow object I mean that the width of it side to side was about 5 to 6 times it's height.  How far away from it we were is only a guess, maybe 2 miles or so.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
