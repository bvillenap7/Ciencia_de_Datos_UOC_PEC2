Black hexagon shaped UFO seen above Ventura on 12-20-14.;2014-12-20 09:28:00;10 minutes;Black hexagon shaped UFO seen above Ventura on 12-20-14 I was hiking down from Grant Park on the road that goes down towards City Hall, and I noticed a black craft flying basically above highway 33 at an altitude of about 3000 to 4000 feet (rough estimate).  The craft looked like a hexagon (6 corners), though due to the distance, it was a bit hard to know if that was its exact shape.  It was black in color.  At times, it would turn sideways, and it was clear that it was flat as a board.  It did not have an exhaust but during the sighting, there appeared to be a whitish, halo effect around it but only during part of the sighting.  It went slowly over westwards towards the ocean and then turned in southerly direction and then slowly continued in a somewhat easterly direction thereafter.  During the time that I saw it, it basically made a large c type of a travel pattern.  Most interestingly, it seemed at the end to simply rise up through the clouds (though it did not increase it elevation for the first 8-9 minutes of the sighting).  There were two other people who were also doing the same hike, and came and started to talk with me about the thing that we were looking at in the sky.  They were as confounded as me.  We all witnessed this sighing, and I have a video of about 3 minutes long that I took on my smart phone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
