odd shape object with lights around it traveling in a southern direction.;2001-02-08 19:00:00;5 minutes;odd shape object with lights around it traveling in a southern direction. I was taking out the trash and I looked straight ahead and I looked at a strange object. It looked like a helicopter with gold circles all around. It took a while for  the object to fly across the sky. It looked to be traveling in a southern direction.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089

Toward hwy 33 in Ventura. I noticed a light in the ski that wasnt moving. It was long and streght like a bar. It stayed there without moving. I could not tell the size but it had to be very large comparing the distance it was away from me. I called my daughter out to look at it as well just to conferm that i was not just seeing things. She saw it also. I then started to slowly get smaller and smaller still in the same spot then it disapered. I went to work on the following Monday and told a co-worker of my experiance and she said she saw it also on Wed. 26, 2001 while she was laying on the beach sometime mid-day. She said it was over the Ventura Mountain Range. I was the same shape, a light in the shape of a long bar.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
An object following a military jet, disappears;2003-06-08 17:00:00;1 minute;An object following a military jet, disappears My Husband and I were outside sitting in our front yard when we saw a jet in the sky ( the kind that leave a vapor trail) I told him to get the telescope so we could see the jet better. He took just a second to grab the telescope and was trying to follow the jet which was moving across the horizen when I noticed another object behind it that seem to just appear. I assumed at first it was another plane as did my husband. we noticed the other object was just hovering near the jet sort of following it . the object was shaped more like a silver football and we comented how odd it was . Perhaps a minute after we saw it appear it just disappeared in front of both of us . The object would have had to move at an impossible speed to disappear the way it did. we live by Point Mugo & Port Hueneme so we wondered if somthing was watching our military jets ((NUFORC Note:  We normally would wonder whether this might have been some type of military refueling operation, although the description above presents certain elements that seem to militate against that possibility, we believe.  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  PD));34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
