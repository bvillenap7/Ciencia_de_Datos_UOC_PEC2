Abruptly maneuvering black object hovers over Ventura County, CA, displaces cloud formations 12/06/02;2002-12-06 16:10:00;10 minutes;Abruptly maneuvering black object hovers over Ventura County, CA, displaces cloud formations 12/06/02 Single dark/black object that changed shape from a disc to an ovoid as it moved.  Object moved south over Ventura County, California at 16:10 to 16:13 at approximately 10-15,000 altitude, then the object hovered in one area from 16:13 to 16:18.  During hover object made several unusually tight (seemingly) uncontrolled maneuvers, and this is when the object changed shape from a disc to an ovoid.  After maneuvering over Ventura County area, object abruptly changed course toward the north and continued north until it was out of sight (from 16:20 to 16:25).  As the object moved, it displaced cloud formations in a circular area surrounding it--the area directly around the object was clear even when flying through cloud formations. Observers: 1) Male 43 Professor at local college.  2) Female 50 Artist/Art instructor at local college.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Bright orange object, incredible speed, diamond shaped and turning;2008-06-19 00:30:00;20 seconds;Bright orange object, incredible speed, diamond shaped and turning Sitting on our patio, looking West, an solid, bright orange craft of unknown origin rose out from the western sky and flew East, directly toward us at a very high rate of speed.  The craft flew in our direction for about 7 or 8 seconds growing larger and then banked sharply to its right, bearing South.  As it turned, it gained altitude and speed.  Best guess of altitude was between 2,000 to 5,000 feet.  Speed at the turn was between 400 and 600 knots.  Speed as the craft rose out of the turn and disappeared increased to well over 1,500 knots and kept increasing as the craft disappeared. We live in Ventura next to the Oxnard airport (very small, local airport) and are also in the flight path of LAX for large jets going to Europe.  We see many passenger planes at night at about 20,000 feet.  Being an avid sky-watcher and novice astronomer I am very well aware of altitude and speed of objects in the sky.  I feel VERY confident of my estimate of altitude and speed.  I have never seen anything in my life move this fast and accellerate so rapidly.  Utterly astonishing! The craft made absolutely no sound and was very low and very close.  It was bright orange with no blinking lights, only a very bright glow.  As it grew closer, before it turned it seemd to be a diamond shape.  Upon turning, the craft left a small aura behind it that dissipated almost instantly.  It was not a lingering contrail like an airplane would leave.  Instead, it looked like vapor coming off the object from such an immediate change in direction and speed (air compression leading to vapor).;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
huge comet like object with fireball trail, turned white, stopped, became incircled by swirling white tails, then disappeared.;2010-09-20 21:15:00;5 minutes;huge comet like object with fireball trail, turned white, stopped, became incircled by swirling white tails, then disappeared. I am a Criminal Investigator and have worked in the Criminal Justice field for 25 years.  I have vast experience in making observations and interpreting them. On September 20, 2010, at about 9:15 pm I was in my backyard letting the dogs go before bed.  I looked up in the North East direction in the sky and observed a large object moving very slowly in the sky, towards my direction.  The object was traveling low in the sky and appeared to have a large fireball tail trailing it. I could see aircraft in other parts of the sky at this time, and the object appeared to be lower than some of the aircraft that I observed. I called my fianc√© to come and look at this object because it was like nothing I have ever seen.  It was huge, the size of a comet which was my first guess as to what it was.  As we continued to watch this object getting closer, the flaming tail turned white and then began swirling around the object.  The object then came to a complete stop, as the white trails continued to swirl around it.  The object itself appeared round and glowed brightly, like a star.  It then simply disappeared right in front of our eyes. The nature of my job makes me a skeptic of sorts.  I have heard of many UFO sightings for which there have been logical explanations.  However, I cannot think of anything that occurs in nature or that is manmade that would perform the way that this object did in the sky that night.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
