Three orange spheres traveling silently in triangle formation until lead sphere broke formation.;2004-11-14 17:55:00;4 minutes;Three orange spheres traveling silently in triangle formation until lead sphere broke formation. Sighted three large spheres traveling in triangle formation southward. Silent, no engine noise.  Initial altitude approx twice that of small airplanes.  (We live near two small airports planes were in the air at the time, could hear one engine off to the west)  The spheres were shining dull/opaque orange, fuzzy, somewhat like chinese lanterns.  Their formation was very rigid intially.  They gained altitude (got smaller & dimmer) as they progressed south over the ocean off Point Mugu Naval Airstation.  The two spheres then seemed to close the gap between them, while the front sphere appeared to stretch the formation upward.  As the formation dimmed in the distance, the front sphere appeared to shoot upward. The rear two spheres stayed together and drifted in a more westerly direction.  Conditions were dark evening, very clear starry night. Just finished looking at the moon off to the west and was heading inside when the formation drifted into view from over my house.  When they were closest to me, I got the impression (not clear vision) I was seeing in through a round, riblike structure.  At first sight I yelled to my son to get his video camera.  Both he and my daughter joined me outside and saw the formation immediately. Nothing is showing on camera LCD screen. I am hunting for the chord to connect camera to TV to review tape keep fingers crossed.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089

5 non blinking red-orange lights in V formation zooming silently across the night sky;2009-11-16 22:20:00;7 seconds;5 non blinking red-orange lights in V formation zooming silently across the night sky Approximately 10:20 PM, PST, Monday, November 16, 2009, walking my dog waiting for him to catch up with me, I looked up into the sky at the Orion constellation and my eye caught the motion of 5 dim red-orange lights moving in a V formation across the sky at a fast pace from east to west, heading directly toward Santa Cruz Island over Ventura, CA.  I could not decipher whether there were 5 individual crafts or one craft with 5 lights. The lights were not blinking. From about 30 degrees up from the eastern sky, it took about 7 seconds from where I picked it up to where it disappeared on the western horizon.  The group of lights were about twice the size of the Little Dipper constellation.  What made the experience so erie, was that it was flying too fast to be flying high or flying too low to not emit any noise.  It was totally silent.  There were no other sounds in the neighborhood to distract from hearing any noises from above.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Large formation flight groups.;2011-09-27 20:30:00;20 minutes;Large formation flight groups The following is a copy of an old email I originally sent to the Southern California chapter of MUFON on 10/17/11.   To the best of my recollection the event lasted about 20 minutes for the formation to go across the approximately half of the sky from North to South.  My line of sight was from Ventura to the direction of Palmdale, California, generally starting along direction above  State Highway 126 and generally along direction of I-5.  There are some tall mountains in that direction so I assume the formation was closer to Ventura, perhaps above Santa Paula or Fillmore.  I estimate height probably at 25 deg. Email as follows:  I visited your site for the first time to see if I could find any relevant info to an experience my girlfriend and I had. I saw that you had sightings for August but nothing for September.  [MUFON]  My main interest is to see if anyone reported several waves of lights in the sky on or about September 27, last month.  Unfortunately I am not sure of the date. I was mostly fascinated by what we saw but didn't think of noting times or recording any events but this is what transpired:  We live in Ventura, California.  It was between 830 - 930 in the evening when we saw a brighter than average light in the sky which initially caught our attention.  We stepped outside to get a better view.  At that time we began to see in the eastern sky, groups of perhaps five craft each heading southbound.  There closely followed another 6 or 7 groupings for approximately 35-40 craft total?  They could have been airplanes, but I have never seen so many at once.  My vision is not the best but the lights were basically white and some of the craft appeared to be flashing a reddish glow, sort of a twinkle.  They were travelling relatively slowly but something about them didn't quite make me think they were airplanes. I mentioned the incident to my neighbor and he said other people reported the event (newspaper?).  I looked online but didn't find any mention.

Five winged objects in formation flying silently and at extremely high speed.;2012-05-07 21:17:00;10 seconds;Five winged objects in formation flying silently and at extremely high speed. It was about 21:17 when my attention was attracted by what I first thought was an owl flying overhead, I then noticed that it might be a formation of large birds at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet, but then I realized that they were flying without wing movement, in a northerly and perfect straight line and crossed the sky at an immense speed so that it vanished within ten seconds.  The objects were wing shaped and seemed to be of a light gray color. No sound whatsoever was heard.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Ufo V Shape.  Formations shifting lights;2012-06-05 21:00:00;8;Ufo V Shape. Formations shifting lights Around 9:10pm on 6/5/2012 my mom and I were in our backyard having a cigarret and out of nowhere she tells me look look there it is I guess.  She seen it before or a ufo so when she said look look what is that on the sky is looked up and saw a shape of a very or a formation shaped as a V it past us by there was no airplanes or jesta around no noise not trust me this thing was like stealth no color then after seen that I started to look around and that's when I saw another object flying over I told my mom look another ufo that's when she looked up and saw it, it past by us again that's when I notice the V shape or one of the lights started to move or or dots shifting around.....   I never believe in ufo's but after last night there's something out thereeee for sure.....;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
line formation of moving lights.  ((Starlink: satellites??));2020-02-07 05:30:00;1 minute;line formation of moving lights On 02/07/2020 at 5:30 AM in Ventura CA I saw one spot light like a satellite moving on the Sky. No surprise, I thought that could be the Space Station moving over CA, but then I saw a second light following the first, a third one, a fourth and so on. I stopped counting at 20. It was more than 30 spot lights following each other in a straight line from west to east. I thought, maybe they are Air Force air planes in training, but no noise, complete silent. Not only silent, but they start to pop up at the same point at the sky over my home, they were not coming from the far west horizon as expected from airplanes, they popped out from the same spot up on the sky. They were pretty high. I do not believe they were meteors because they were pretty stable in light intensity, no tail behind, and all following a very straight line. They were not spaced regularly, distance between each consecutive light was not uniform, but not too much different. All the action took ! no more than 1 min, than I had to go take my bus to commute.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
