It was just after the sun set over the Channel Islands.  A red shaped object darted from the horizon to above the island (Santa Cruz Island).  I then rushed to my telescope to get a closer look.  I could not make out a definite shape of the object, it had a red/orange glow.  It hovered over the island for a few seconds then began to glide WNW, making no sound at all.  At that point the object disapeared into the atmosphere. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  We wonder whether the witness might have been witnessing a high-altitude aircraft, or contrail behind an a/c.  Only a guess, on our part.  PD));34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089

I was star gazing with my feline friend Silvia on an exceptionally clear night and the only other thing  I can somewhat compare this to is the last space shuttle launching 4/13/11.  This difference was that this object was much more of a pulsing light with a slight haze around it without the fire tail moving at least 20x the speed.  Not as fast as an average meteor but much faster then anything else.   It first appeared out if nowhere and continued to pulse quickly directly above me as I was laying in the sand.  The Object was flying directly North crossing the entire sky before it diminished with a last pulse. ;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
A very bright star, that flickered like a little like fire for about 10 mins and then disappeared.;2012-06-23 20:10:00;5-10 minutes;A very bright star, that flickered like a little like fire for about 10 mins and then disappeared. Saw a flickering light in the N sky.  At first it looked like it was moving but I wasn't sure about that.  Then I assumed it was just a bright star and that I was mistaken about the movement.  Then I watched it for about 5-10 minutes because I thaught it an unusual flicker for a star.  Then it faded away in about 3-5 seconds time...virtually dissappeared.  I have never seen a star fade away like that.  It was a very clear night.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Huge black circle with fire ball!;2012-11-16 19:00:00;5 minutes;Huge black circle with fire ball! Date we saw object: 11/16/12  Time: 8:30-9:00 pm  Where: Above Santa Cruz Island head south bound on the 101 freeway between Rincon and Seacliff. My daughter, boyfriend and I were headed home after having dinner in Carpinteria, Ca.  We live in La Conchita, Ca.  Due to the freeway construction we now have to pass our town and exit Seacliff, then turn around on the freeway headed north to come home.  As I was driving past LC my daughter got all excited.  She said she just say a big bright light out over the ocean.  As we passed Mussel Shouls she screamed there it is! I turned and saw a bright orange and red ball of fire circling what looked like a blacked out moon hanging just above the Santa Cruz Island.  It was so bright I could see the outline of the mountains on the island. We pulled to the side of the freeway just before Seacliff and got out of the car. I could see the oil rigs clearly.  The object we say was way past them and seemed to be at least 5 times bigger and 100 times brighter.  You could tell it was just above the island not moving.  Then the lights fadded and went out. We got back in the car and started for home headed north bound now.  As we were coming up to Mussle Shouls the object reappeared.

V-shaped Objects in Skies of Ventura Ca.;2013-03-08 23:00:00;30 minutes;V Shaped Objects in Skies of Ventura, Ca. We were outside in our patio and we live on a hill.  We saw off the Mountain Tops several small red rounded things in the sky they were in formation making a V shape in the sky I would think about 30 of them, they went into the sky and all left.  We did not hear of anything from our local paper. We do not have a local news.  This is the first time we saw anything like this. The formation really was awesome a perfect V shape and they were all flying out into the sky. Tank you we do not have any pictures as it was so fast.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089

White ball bigger than any shooting star I've seen with a trail glowing 8x its width behind just above our low hill tops over two trees.  Then the ball disappeared not sure if it was out of sight or vanished but appeared again slightly smaller but 2 balls with glowing g trails the balls did change color from a white to a light green then a light orange.
