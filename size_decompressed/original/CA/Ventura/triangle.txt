Black low flying noiseless big triangular shaped craft seen during lunar eclipse;2003-05-15 21:20:00;5 sec;Black low flying noiseless big triangular shaped craft seen during lunar eclipse I was witnessing the lunar eclipse with a good friend among others at a place called The Cross  which is a high hill in my city.  As we were looking in the sky and doing some small talk, a person behind me said, Hey, what's that?.  I looked up directly overhead and saw a very dark, probably dark grey or black triangular craft, flying at about 300 feet overhead with a dull non-blinking white light on each tip of the triangle. The craft was noiseless and flying pretty slow, maybe at about 30-60 miles/hour. If someone hadn't pointed it out, I probably would not have noticed it.  It was big though, probably around 60-100 feet wide.  It passed over our heads in a straight line towards the eclipsed moon and looked as if it veered to the right before disappearing into the haze. Total sighting time was about 5 seconds.  It was very eery and strange.  I have a hard time believing that we have the technology for something to fly like this.  The other two witnesses saw exactly the same thing as myself, but my friend convinced himself it was a flock of birds after hearing what we saw.  I had my glasses on and was of sober mind, that is for sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having consider technical training.  PD));34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Triangle and silent with three lights;2003-05-15 21:30:00;10 sec.;Triangle and silent with three lights it was completely silent and triangular in shape it was moving south and had three lights on each angle, then it seemed to disapear.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Lights in V formation;2004-05-10 21:15:00;15-20 sec;Lights in V formation I wanted to watch the new comet near to the Procion on the W-WS sky with my Cassagrain 5 telescope, when I attracted my attention of a chirping very quiet sound from behind the trees on the other side of the street (around 1kHz? with 5 Hz modulation), which stopped (or turned down) after appearing the object (I cannot recognize the clearly the shape, its outline was closely as a bumerang ?, with transparent body). The lights was orange in the V formation, on left side 5-6 in the sraight line and 2 on the right side. The object flew quietly from West to Eatst and I felt it has big inercia. Its way visualy crossed the Venus. But the brightness of the Venus changed only slightly (I am not sure) I was very supprised. I attach a picture, which I found on the web and it is very close to that, what I saw. The visula size of the object was similar as on the attached picture with comparation with the Moon). Only the lights was orange without any blinking or changing of the intensity. Before the object dissappeared I saw it as from the back position (still V formation) but the lights I saw in the same intensity.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
A Triangular craft  that was highly visible;2010-04-15 21:00:00;8 seconds;A Triangular craft  that was highly visible At approximately 9 P.M. PDT on April 15th, 2010 in Ventura California. I was looking toward the west at the constellation of Orion when I heard a brief screech sound lasting around one second and coming from the vicinity which I was viewing. Thinking it was an owl I quickly looked for it and saw a faint silhouette of something moving in the clear sky.  At first it looked like it was a large bird high in the air as the front and two sides were heavily darkened against the mostly dark sky.  It was moving toward me and over a period of about 2 seconds it became clearer and resembled a hang-glider. It was descending and moving toward the east and seemed to be gliding smoothly, making no sound that I could hear.   As it reached its closest point to me, what looked to be several hundred feet or so, a very sharp and definite outline appeared.  It was an equilateral triangle and had three circular areas symmetrically placed near the tips. There was a slight contrast between the gray triangular area and the circular areas, as the circular portions ! had a very faint glowing quality to them.  As it silently continued moving away from me, the craft seemed to have only 2 dimensions.  It looked completely flat like it was a projection.  It began to gently ripple with smooth wave patterns and disappeared within a little over a second after doing so. The total event lasted around 8 seconds. I have my masterâ€™s degree in physics and teach college level physics as a career.  I am also involved in astronomy.  I am about 20 minutes drive from a naval base and do hear and see military aircraft from time to time. Though it is possible that I was seeing a secret aircraft,  I am doubtful that such a craft would be flown in such plain view as it was very apparent what was seen.  Judging from the change in angular diameter, its descent was fairly rapid and it changed from a dark, fluctuating shadow into a crisp configuration, lightly contrasted against the clear dark sky.  I would estimate the base of the triangle to be around 50 feet, though I could be way off.   Once leveled off at around 500 feet, it glided forward at perhaps 100 miles per hour until it disappeared from sight somewhat like a mirage does. The measured angle from the horizontal at which the craft began to wave out of sight was around 20 degrees.  It all happened very fast and was short in duration, m! aking it difficult to be definite on measurements.  All in all, I saw a craft without doubt and I am perplexed by what I have seen.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Clear triangle over Ventura;2012-03-04 21:00:00;20 seconds;Clear triangle over Ventura Stepped out to my front yard facing west. Looking to the south saw very clearly 3 lights moving from west to east.  Three lights were dull, not brite.  Each of the lights were ringed with what looked like exhaust grills - they resembled what a jet engine turbine looks like when not running. It move silently at about the speed of a commercial jet - first thought was not alian UFO but some new aircraft.  Point Mugu is not far from Ventura. Next night went back out at the same time not expecting much but in the same direction, south, much higher I saw a light that zig zagged to a stop then dropped down stopped then moved to the East. Again the speed was not extraordinary  but the movement was.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089

A distortion pattern of the sky in the shape of a ginormous glider plane silently flew overhead and over the roof.  I was so unsettled that i ran away from the building to get look at it and I could see it fly over me.  Silently:   It looked like a dark, distorted space in the shape of glider plane with a 30 foot wingspan quietly flying low as in 3-4 stories. .

Above the cross in ventura california at around 21:15 my wife and I got out of the car seen 3 redish orange lights in a line then they formed a triangle s yelled out look at that as I pointed to the sky two passers-by stared in amazement as the lights faded in seconds with unbelievable speed.
