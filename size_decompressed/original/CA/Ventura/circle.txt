As both of us we riding our bikes, I looked up to the south/East about the large trees and right above them were the three objects hovering and not moving.   I screamed, fell off my bike, my friend looked at me first and then looked up to see the exact same object not moving, but the outer part was moving around the main center part and the lights were white.  She grabbed me to get up, I got back on my bike, screaming all the way home.   When we got back to my house my mom came out to see what was going on.  I could not talk either could my friend.  The object made a humming sound when the outer ring was moving round the center.   The ojects followed us all the way down as soon as we both got on our bikes and riding home.  As soon as we got home, and my mom came out all three we gone.  I have talked this this friend over the years about the experience but either one of us have told others, but my mom.   I am happy to have an outlet to tell this story that happened because I have been holding it in for so many years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in April 1974 is approximate.

UFO aircraft seen on the horizen.;2000-06-14 22:00:00;1.5 - 2 hours;UFO aircraft seen on the horizen. The event occured while I was camping at Lake Casitas. At the campsite me and couple of others were sitting down looking at the horizon star gazing. While we were stargazing a light appeared out of nowhere that resembled a bright star, much like Jupiter or another close planet. The light moved down right above the mountains, and hovered there for what seemed to be half an hour. Then the light moved to the east about 300 - 400 yards (hard to tell due to distance). The movement of the craft was instantaneous and very smooth. From my experience of observing aircraft no known modern craft is capable of this kind of movement. Then a second light appeared, exactly like the first light. It moved to where the first light was, then joined the first light. It stayed there for about half an hour and then went up and dissapeared. The first light remained in its original position for another 10 minutes, then also went up and dissapeared. It is my firm belief that these were UFOs. I was under no narcotics or alcohol, and have never taken hallucenegens. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A hovering saucer is sighted on Lake Havasu, Ariz at night.;2002-05-22 00:30:00;5-7 min;A hovering saucer is sighted on Lake Havasu, Ariz at night. I was sitting on my porch and I saw a great big circle of lights in the air. I waked out on the lawn to get a better look and it shined a very bright light in my face. The object looked about 100 ft in diameter and very flat. There was one big light in the center of it and maybe a dozen around the outside of it. Thatever it was didnt seem very interested in hurting me but more just looking at me and my surroundings. Then after approximately 5-7 minutes the object dissapeared. It didn't fly away but it dissapeared.

Upon leaving the restaurant and walking to our car we saw three dull orange lights flying in a triangular pattern in the night sky.  The craft were flying in a northern direction.  They made approximately a 130 degree turn and flew in front of the moon.  As they were in front of the moon, they could not be seen because of the moons brightness.  Once past the moon the craft continued in a southwestern direction for approximately 10 seconds.  They turned back to the northern direction they were originally headed, rotated so that they were on plan with our line of site and flew off until they could no longer be seen.  I have never seen an airplace make the turns with the speed and sharpness of these craft.  The lights were not bright pinpoints of light as is seen on an airplane, but rather dull circles of light.  The craft did not make any noise.  During this incident, which lasted for approximately 45 seconds, an airplane flew overhead in a northeastern direction  The airplane was clearly visible and could be heard easily.  I believe that there were three different craft involved and not one for two reasons:  1.  The relative brightness of the lights did not change while the craft turned or rotated.  I would have expected the brightness of the lights to dim, brighten or be obscured as the relative positions of the lights on a rigid craft changed as it turned or rotated.  2.  The positions of the lights relative to each other changed, which would not happen if they were attached to a rigid body.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089

It had a long streak with it too.  We were both looking in the southwest direction, towards the Pacific Ocean. We asked the people around us if they saw it but no one did.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089

The object was also disappearing and returning and changing colors from blue/red/purple.  It apparently had been there for a few hours.  Tonight the same thing was seen. I drove to Surfers Point where the light could be best seen.  The object would swoop down as low as the tree tops and vanish but with tonight's moonlight I could see a complete outline of it when the lights turned off.  It is a toy plane with LED lights attached and whoever was controlling it had a remote to turn the lights on and off. Debunked.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
Bright Blue Object seen floating in sky near Coast in Ventura, California;2012-09-09 21:00:00;5 minutes;Bright Blue Object seen floating in sky near Coast in Ventura, California My husband and I were driving southbound toward the Pacific Ocean, and we saw a bright blue light in the sky.  It didn't look like airplane lights, and it was too high up in the atmosphere to be a helicopter.  The bright blue light was shining steadily, and it wasn't blinking.  There were times when it looked like it may have disappeared behind a cloud, but we weren't quite sure, because the visibility was quite clear out that night.  It was going in one direction, then it switched back to the other direction.  After a few seconds, it switched back to the other direction. It looked like it was 'floating' floating down from the atmosphere.  We drove the beach to see if we could see it.  When we got there, we couldn't find it in the sky anymore.  Another family (a man and his son) had pulled over in their car behind us, and said they saw the same thing.  They said they saw the color red before it turned to the blue color.

Eerie lights hovering above Ventura tonight.  ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter and Venus.  PD));2015-06-29 22:30:00;1:00 am ongoing;Eery lights hovering above Ventura tonight. While walking to my car at Ralph's shopping center I saw in the sky 2 extremely bright lights looked round, one smaller than the other, the smaller on top.   Sat in my car for several minutes and lights were stationary.  Drive off but a couple miles down the road the lights were still visible and in same location.

Round glowing ball changes shape.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a celestial body…a star or planet, we suspect.  PD));2016-11-21 18:00:00;45 minutes;Round glowing ball changes shape On Nov. 21, 2016, my ex-spouse and myself, were walking by the Ventura, CA, walkway close to the pier when in our stargazing we noticed a brighter light in the sky.  It looked like it stood still then moved and changed colors.  We were watching this about 15 mins when I decided to video record it and the zoom in on it.  I sent this live on Facebook for the 14 mins I recorded this phenomenon.  It really gets strange from minute 7 to minute 6 when it appears to change shape.  We were amazed at the few people that were walking along did not stop and I was too busy to attract anyone's attention to this because I was busy filming.  After 14 mins of recording I dropped my exapouse home, then I returned, and after 7 pm, I noticed it still there.   Review the video and please help me identify what this is.;34.3045826306914;-119.283166779089
