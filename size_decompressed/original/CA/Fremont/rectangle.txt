Anomalous object, lacking any aerodynamic features, rect./oval shape, DC-10 size, moving eastward.;2004-08-29 19:45:00;5 minutes;Anomalous object, lacking any aerodynamic features, rect./oval shape, DC-10 size, moving eastward. While driving north on I-880 from Milpitis into Fremont, I noticed a dark colored object that I thought must have been an advertizing baloon or something. I soon realized its altitude was much higher and was moving eastward. This object was at the same altitude as the air-traffic from San Jose Int'l Airport. This object was large and was the approx. size of a passenger Jet. From my position the object was the size of a jelly-bean. It was dark in color and the shape was somewhere between oval and rectangle. This object had no wings, propellers or any other aero-dynamic features. HAS ANY ONE ELSE NOTICED THIS BESIDES ME!? (I did not see an obvious reaction from traffic and have heard no news reports.);37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
