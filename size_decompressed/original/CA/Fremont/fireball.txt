When looked up at the sky i saw a small bright shape behind the clouds. I didn't find this unusual so I was about to go back into the house when the wind started picking up. It became very windy and my garbage can was knocked over. I looked up into the sky at that moment and i saw the bright shape come out of the clouds.
