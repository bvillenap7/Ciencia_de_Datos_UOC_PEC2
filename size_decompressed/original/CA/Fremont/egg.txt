Egg shape craft, silver and reflective in the San Francisco bay area.;2003-05-27 07:30:00;20min;Egg shape craft, silver and reflective in the San Francisco bay area. I was stuck in morning commute on southbound 880. From Fremont to Milptas, CA a small silver egg shape slowly cam from the west around 7:30 from the direction of Sunnyvale from out of no where. It wasn't a plane and it moved too slow to be one. It slowly traveled at about 5,000ft from sunnyvale area to milpitas, north a little, then east to mountain ridge, then turned and stayed still, it then headed south quickly then disappeared. It was reflective at times when the sun hit it. No lights on it or beacons like a plane would have. It didn't seem in a hurry and a lot of people would have seen it if they were paying attention. The air is warm and still this morning, like earthquake wheather. The sky is blue with an unlimited ceiling. I hope other people report what they saw as well.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
