I saw a lime green sphere last night.  It looked to be a meteor. Is that correct?  Did anyone else see this in the local area?  has anyone else reported the lime green meteor?  It looked like it was going to crash into a few thousand homes,  and just like that- it vanished.  It left a bright yellow [duo] trail of firey yellow-white, that also vanished quickly shortly afterwards. I was driving down hiway 880 N bound to take my son home to Hayward,and on the way I saw a lime green sphere with a fiery [duo] trail trailing behind it.  It appeared so quickly, and then it vanished- I wondered if the radiation will harm any of the people there, or the animals, or the plants. This was at the area of Alavardo Blvd/ to the right side of hiway 880 at the direction of 90 degree angle or the top line of the 90 degree agle at a very fast rate of speed. It evaporated-vanished or something else as it dropped out of sight!  The sky was clear, and the visibility was excellent.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
Saw four spheres in the sky, paired up, and moving oddly.;2008-08-09 13:00:00;4 minutes;Saw four spheres in the sky, paired up, and moving oddly. statement 1: I was looking up at a plane flying by, the sky was clear blue, no clouds. The plane was flying in a north-west direction and then I saw four spheres flying the opposite direction, in a v-formation. When they crossed paths with the plane, they stayed and hovered in that spot. It looked like they were “dancing” around. Then they paired up, and kept “dancing,” but in pairs of two (side by side). They were overhead and then began to fly away from us, in pairs, in a northbound direction. It took about 30 seconds to be out of sight. statement 2: When my cousin saw the four objects in the sky, I looked for them. They were barely visible but once you found them they were very obvious. At first they looked liked balloons but then they stayed in one spot and moved into pairs. They were moving very oddly and then moved away from us, into the distance. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with one of the witnesses, and she sounded to us to be sincere, in making her sighting report.  PD));37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
