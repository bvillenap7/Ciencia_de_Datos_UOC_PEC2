Huge cloaked craft with 6-sided color changing lights flies silently overhead in bay area.;1993-02-14 19:00:00;1/2 hour;Huge cloaked craft with 6-sided color changing lights flies silently overhead in bay area. I always wanted to make this report and now I found a place to do this, thanks.  Please believe me, I know the following will sound crazy but I swear it this is the truth. I remember the date because it was my daughter's first birthday, our guests had left and my husband was on the balcony/patio of our 3rd floor apartment.  I had changed and was about to exit the bedroom onto the balcony to join him and I noticed as I looked in the direction of the bay (west) a huge dramatic cloud formation and suddenly before I knew what was happening, I heard myself saying, “Look at that cloud, there is a UFO inside it.”    We were both a little shocked to hear me say this, I do not know what possessed me, but sure enough no sooner had I said than the cloud parted and I just recall seeing it closer and there were I think like 6-sided lights all over it, in various colors, like green, red blue, blinking and changing colors.  I could not make out a shape to the “craft” as the oddest part was that it seemed to be cloaked or something, with different parts being exposed and concealed like a clocking cloud moving around it?!  Neither of us knew what to think – could not prcess what we were seeing other than it was extraordinary!   Then, we must have said something like the aliens are here and with that my husband jumped up on the railing and hung on the roof eaves as it passed over our heads (!!!) and he shouted, “Take me!  I immediately shouted “Over my dead body!”  -  (which we joked about for years after!)   As it moved overhead it seemed HUGE like a football field or something but we never saw anything but these cloaked lights and that it was huge.  And silent, completely noiseless!  I knew to check time, had heard stories about missing time, we we did not miss time, but I do not recall how it disappeared maybe disappeared over roof to other side of bldg. out of sight, but then almost simultaneously, we noticed there were federal agents suddenly swarming on the apartment complex, battering down a door on a ground floor apartment (they had ATF on their shirts) and they carried out boxes of stuff and disappeared after an hour, or so, maybe. I have no idea if this was connected but it seemed awfully coincidental these 2 extraordinary events happening at the same time. My husband died in a car crash 8 years ago, I wish we had told this earlier, but I wanted to record it in case anyone else has seen anything comparable.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806

Bright light projecting beams beneath and leaving cloud trails behind.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:05:00;7 minutes;Bright light projecting beams beneath and leaving cloud trails behind. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD)) I was outside just after sunset at approximately 6:05 PST when out of the South from the direction of San Jose I notice a bright pinpoint of light. At first it looked like an aircraft light in the sky, but as I watched it began projecting two searchlights from underneath, creating a V-shape of light, like two searchlights. Then I noticed the lights were creating a cloud or mist in the sky where the shone. The intensity of the searchlights grew in size and intensity as I watched. The searchlight-like beams below the light stretched down and grew brighter. Two distinct beams were being projected at about a 30 degree angle below and to the left of the light. The light appeared to be at a high altitude, and I thought at first it was a satellite reentering Earth’s atmosphere. It was moving at a rate of speed similar to an aircraft, and as it moved Northwest, the beams grew in intensity. The cloud beneath it remained luminescent for some time as the light progress! ed, and it left a separate, fainter blue-colored trail, behind it marking it’s direction of travel. As I watched the light went behind some tall trees, and I lost sight of it. It reappeared much dimmer when it emerged from the trees, with no lights projecting from beneath it. It slowed, and became an amorphous light (more like Haley’s comet the last time it came around) and seemed to change shape, from a point of light to a vertical shape. I watched for another couple of minutes as it grew dimmer, changing direction and heading Westward towards the ocean until I could no longer see it. Entire event lasted about 5-7 minutes?;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
