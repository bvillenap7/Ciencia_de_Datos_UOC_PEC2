A black cylinder floated in the sky.;2008-07-20 13:00:00;20 sec;A black cylinder floated in the sky I saw a black cylinder floating in the sky. I got my binoculars out for a closer look. The object was black with a polished gold dome on the top. I could see hardware or plumbing on the black surface. It was silent and floated and rotated slowly much like a balloon. It remained vertical with the gold dome facing up. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness.  He sounded quite sincer to us.  We have corrected the date above.
