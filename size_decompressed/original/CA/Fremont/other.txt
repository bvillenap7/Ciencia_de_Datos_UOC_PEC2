Suddenly bright overwhelming light thru the black raining night. I saw a craft traveling low going east to west completely dominant with it wings on backwards for the direction it was traveling. I was amazed and ran out side to find the object gone. Next day in the local paper reports of sighting. I have told few people of what I saw but brush it off as a experimental out of nearby Moffet Field.  I can see it vividly still and can draw its shape.. As I get older I still wonder what it was. I can still see the square lights that were attached to the wings. They were so strong and backlit the craft shape. This is the firsttime I`ve ever talked about this incident ((NUFORC Note:  The witness in this case hold a very responsible position, and would be construed to be a qualified observer.  We have requested an illustration from the witness, and a copy of the newspaper article, which may allow confirmation of the date.  Date above may be approximate.  Given the proximity of the sighting to Moffett Field in San Jose, we cannot rule out some kind of unusual aircraft, but it would be surprising to have such an aircraft flying apparently very low over a populated area.

Fast Moving;2008-06-19 17:00:00;1 to 2 minutes;Fast Moving I point and shoot the digital in the blank sky and when I come home to see the pictures in my computer, I can see many UFO in the pictures. I don't know how to make it in slow motion mode. If anyone can do that you will see the shape of UFOs. I just use pause button to see the shape of them. There are many shapes such as rod and also disk. They are moving so fast that my naked eyes cannot see it at all without the help of the digotal camera.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806

I observed it while I was sitting in my backyard alone.  Pretty intense because I've never seen something of its kind?;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
