bright lights, green, red, white, hovering high in the sky for a very long period of time.;2002-10-08 02:30:00;hours;bright lights, green, red, white, hovering high in the sky for a very long period of time. im not sure what this is hence my labeling it a ufo. i am going to surf the net to try and find out what it might be. it is high in the sky, higher than any planes but it must be somewhat low because the lights are very bright. i see red, green and white lights blinking very fast. i thought it might be a plane or sattelite but im not sure because it does not move at all. could a star or planet make this kind of alternating color flashes?

Two bright stars faded simultaneously in approx. 4 seconds.;2005-11-11 05:30:00;30 seconds;Two bright stars faded simultaneously in approx. 4 seconds. I came back from my morning run in Fremont CA. at about 5:30 in the morning on the morning of Nov. 11th 2005.  I was facing W-SW when I finished my run, and turned to my right to end up facing NW.  I immediately noticed two stars in the constellation Cassiopeia that were very bright.  The stars were separated by a distance equal to the width of my thumb at arms length.  They were as bright as Venus, and equal to each other in magnitude.  I knew the stars were out of place, and thought I was witnessing some strange double supernova.  The sky was crystal clear without a hint of clouds. I was thinking about looking them up and finding out what was going on when, as I was looking at them, they both faded simultaneously to the point of invisibility in about 4 seconds. I never took my eyes off of them through the whole event. I would say that I had been looking at them for about 30 seconds. They didn't belong there in the first place. I could not make sense of what I was seeing, and still can't. The stars were stationary the whole time. At first I thought I might be looking at a couple of geosynchronous satellites that were rotating through a position of reflecting to non-reflecting, but the position was too far north of the Celestial Equator. I don't think we can place geosynchronous satellites in orbits that far off of the Celestial Equator. I don't know what I saw, but I definitely saw it. I have asked several astronomy buffs, and some of my friends that work with satellites. No answer. This seems to count as a UFO however high it was flying, and I just needed to let someone know other than my circle of friends.

Lights that, at first glance looked like a plane that was going to crash.;2011-05-29 22:10:00;30 - 60 seconds;Lights that, at first glance looked like a plane that was going to crash. My family and I we were coming off the freeway 880 south taking the Fremont/Alvarado exit in the East San Francisco Bay Area.  I was playing with my camera because I just got it 2 nights before and I had been trying to take a still picture of the traffic at night with the lights and stuff because the camera has all these features that I wanted to learn to use...  So coming off the freeway, I saw a plane or what I thought was a plane at first and it was flying in an angle like it was going to land on a runway but it was in the direction of the boulevard.  It was dark and 10:10pm and I saw only lights but I thought this plane was flying low and going to crash and as we came to the intersection off ramp off the freeway onto Fremont Blvd.  This is a busy boulevard, even at night.   We stopped at the light and I was just going to tell my husband, Don't go into the intersection I think that plane is going to crash...  But just when we stopped at the light, the plane, or lights suddenly stopped mid air and just hovered about a street light pole height above the street lights.  As I watched it while we were waiting for the light to turn left onto Fremont Blvd, the lights or plane hovered in the direction of Fremont Blvd South direction as if it were waiting for the light to change as well, almost like they stopped and said hey wait, she's got a camera and watching our car.   And as it was sitting there all of a sudden, while we were waiting for the light the one light on the right, swung behind the other light and came up on it on it's left and just sat there and when we moved in traffic, both lights started going..  It was weird like they were motorcycles driving in traffic but way up in the air.   Since I didn't know how to use my new camera very well, the camera had a delay on it and only took two pictures before the light changed and my husband drove off.  I kept telling my husband wait, wait, I see a UFO but he thought I was trying to be funny because I always make fun of him because he ! watches all the alien shows and on the most part, don’t believe in any aliens or anything.  He just didn’t believe me and kept driving.   When I got the pictures on the computer to blow it up, you can see a 3rd light behind the two I had seen and didn’t see when it happened.   I don’t know if there was any sound or not because we had the radio on in the car.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
Two sightings in two days both different types.;2012-06-24 22:00:00;5-10 seconds;Two sightings in two days both different types. My brother and I were in my backyard.  My brother saw the light first and pointed out a single bright white light flying extremely fast.  We watched it fly for almost 10 seconds then it disappeared in mid air. It was a solid bright white light and didn't have any flashing lights around it. There were commercial planes flying lower than the light at much slower speeds.   On June/23/2012, the night before, I was outside having a cigarette and I saw what I thought was a really bright star. As I was looking at it, a blue ball of light separate from the white light, circled the light clockwise until it met the point where it emerged then it disappeared. I will be out there tonight with a camera and video camera in case there's another.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806

Three very bright lights in the morning sky.;2015-01-29 07:45:00;2 minutes;Three very bright lights in the morning sky. This happened after I passed Stevenson Blvd. exit while in my vehicle, going South on 880.  I could see three very bright white lights in the sky from a distance.  These were three separate objects, but they were somewhat of the same altitude from where I was viewing. The object in the middle was very bright (the brightest), the light was pulsing, and it was moving downwards very slowly.  After about 30 seconds, it disappeared, then reappeared as a smaller light for another 10 seconds or so.  Then it completely vanished. To the right of the brightest object was a smaller one that was moving horizontally very slowly.  It didn’t blink at all. It looked like a bright star during a clear night. To the left of the brightest object was a smaller one that was moving downwards slowly, the light on it was also pulsing.  It went on for about 40 seconds. The distance between the objects from my viewpoint, was about 1 inch horizontally.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
Star-like object moving strangely in the sky.;2015-08-12 22:30:00;3 minutes;Star-like object moving strangely in the sky. Looked like a star moving slowly across the sky, it moved straight then moved in s series of small U shapes.  This was repeated randomly, it was very high and moved through the Big Dipper.  I thought perhaps a satellite but I could not understand what could be moving like that at that altitude. Not sure if it's related but soon after I lost sight of it a fast moving airplane crossed the sky in the same direction, it moved extremely quickly but at regular airplane altitude;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
