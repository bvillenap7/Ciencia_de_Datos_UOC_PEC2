UFO Spotted in Fremont Hills;2008-04-09 00:30:00;20 minutes;UFO Spotted in Fremont Hills Hello,  I just witnessed a rather strange event in Fremont. I'm located in the Mission Hills, and noticed a very loud noise, assuming it to be an aircraft. However, it did not fly over as usual, and considering we have no airport I was perplexed. I looked out the window and assumed that it was a helicopter of some sort. However, the flight pattern and speed was unlike any helicopter, and I fail to understand why a helicopter would be in near barren hills. The aircraft made several rounds, rather than concentrating a search if it was for a search, and upon closer direct inspection it had no helicopter blades and thus was not a helicopter. However, it did have the ability to levitate. The craft was in sight for around 20 minutes, circling around a few times and eventually leaving. I do have some video off of my camera phone that I can provide. If you could provide an explanation, it would be appreciated, but as far as I am concerned, I cannot explain what I saw. This occurred at about 12:30am tonight in Fremont. There was two bright lights, one on front and back, and a bluish light. Thanks.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806

Blue lights and sharp maneuvers.;2021-07-31 21:30:00;30;Blue lights and sharp maneuvers. Shortly after 9:30PM, me and one of my family members spotted a mysterious blue light doing weird maneuvers in the sky. The object wasn’t that bright, just a blue dot. It did many maneuvers like shooting straight up and making 90° turns. The object was dimming and then getting bright again. Finally it dropped below the horizon causes a loud boom that set off car alarms.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
