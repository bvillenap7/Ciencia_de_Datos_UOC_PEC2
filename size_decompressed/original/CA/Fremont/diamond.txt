The North wall in my bedroom was almost all windows and I had a nice view of the canyon wall opposite the one our house was built on. I saw two diamond shaped craft slowly descending vertically, disappearing behind the hill on the other side of the canyon. As they descended they pulsated slowly in unison back and fourth from a bright red to orange in color. As they became bright red, the sky around them glowed giving them an aura. I could clearly see their shape and could tell they were not anything like a plane or helicopter. It looked to me like they were landing and I had an urge to go and investigate, but fear and the fact that it would have been a several hour hike to get to where they were kept me from doing so. I stayed awake for most the night waiting for them to take off and never saw them again. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
