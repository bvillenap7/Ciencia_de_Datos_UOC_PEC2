Formation of circular lights traveling across the sky.;2008-01-01 00:03:00;4 mins;Formation of circular lights traveling across the sky a string of 5 lights in formation travelling slowly across the sky, no lights were seen as part of a helicopter/plane. It looked like christmas lights floating across the sky heading from the east bay to pacific ocean.  We watched it and thought at first it was fireworks, but it just kept traveling and heading west.  It was definitely NOTHING we have ever seen before.  It just kept on on going, 5 balls of light bright and looked like a string of christmas lights.  It just dissapeared.  The sky was clear and we saw all the stars and saw this thing pass across the sky.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
Formation of gold lights hovering over open space;2008-03-21 21:20:00;45 seconds;Formation of gold lights hovering over open space I was driving south down 680 towards San Jose heading near Fremont area at around 9:20 when I noticed what appeared to be a string of lights in the sky ahead of me to the east. I noticed that objects were close as they were to my direct left after I drove about half a mile. I then could see that they were stationary in the sky and appeared to be lantern/disc-like structures that glowed gold. I pulled to the side of the highway and put on my emergency lights. They were in a formation that appeared to be like a scoop. They were silent and hovered over an open field maybe the equivalent of five or six city blocks away from where I was parked. I was able to snap a few photographs what I had seen and when I was manipulating my digital camera to change settings to get a clearer picture, I looked up and noticed that the lights were quickly hovering and moving in unison southbound. I pulled my car back into traffic and continued driving south and noticed other vehicles pulled over to the side of the highway.The lights then seemed to disappear behind hills. I then noticed 2 fast aircraft with red lights flying toward the general vicinity of where I had seen the formation of lights.  I drove 10 miles further south and switched over to 880 south via Mission and looked east and noticed an intensely bright gold light with a smaller light above it hovering over a distant town.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
