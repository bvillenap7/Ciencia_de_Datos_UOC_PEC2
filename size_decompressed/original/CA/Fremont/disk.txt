Clear sighting of UFO;1982-08-01 23:30:00;Saucer;Clear sighting of UFO I was looking out the window of a moving trailer. I then suddenly saw a saucer with little square windows all the way around lit up with light. The saucer was flying fairly slow and low to where it was clear of view. The saucer span in circles while moving forward. For example, like if somebody is holding a spinning basketball on their fingure, and walking forward while the ball is spinning. The saucer flew out of my view.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
The craft  skipped across the sky very fast without making a sound.;2003-05-30 19:30:00;30 sec;The craft  skipped across the sky very fast without making a sound. While talking on the telephone I was looking into my backyard through a sliding glass door. I noticed a silver disk with a white dome on top flying overhead. I ran outside for a closer look,this craft was moving very fast heading south. It did not make a sound or leave a trail of any kind. Im an aircraft mechanic and I know what conventional aircraft look and sound like. I would say it was less than 3000 feet up and moving at several hundred mile per hour. It was so perfect it looked like it was turned on a lathe. It had the look of stainless steel or satin finished aluminum. The dome on the top looked like white plastic. twenty years ago I saw seven disks at night flying in a V formation. They were on the very same flight path. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is an aircraft mechanic.  We have corresponded with him, and he seems to us to be a quite credible witness.  PD));37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
strange shiny silver object flew fast over the hill, stops, then disappears;2006-08-08 14:09:00;25 sec.;strange shiny silver object flew fast over the hill, stops, then disappears OK. I don't know how to explain this. I just saw something fly over the hills behind my house. I usually sit on the back porch in the afternoons, leaning against the screen door, looking at the cows on the hill. 10 minutes earlier as usual I was quietly observing them. Then from over the hill this silver thing flies in a fast, straight line, just over the hill. It kept moving forward a little, but seemed to have stopped and turned around. It stayed in place until it found a direction. It started moving to the right slowly. I was standing up by this time and moving closer to the fence. By the time I got to the fence the thing disappeared. It was gone. It didn't fly over the hills again, it had already moved a good way out from them. Unless it moved faster than I could see... I saw it and then it disappeared.  I was thinking, maybe it was a balloon? But the wind was going over the hills in the other direction. When it came over the hills in my direction it was coming fast, then it stopped. It still moved upward and north the last time I saw it. I distinctly saw the shape of it and it wasn't round, nor was it oblong, it was not the shape of a balloon. It looked like a flying saucer with a lid on it. It was flat and shiny on the bottom, and the top looked like an oval cut in half and attached to it. It was definately bigger than at least eight big black cows put together. I saw its dimensions after it flew over the hill and turned around abruptly. It moved to the left, then back to the right, slowly moving toward the Bay and shifting direction, until it disappeared. It was silver and shiny and distinctive in the clear blue sky. There was nothing else up in the sky at that time. Nothing flies that low over the hill in the direction toward my house. I can't think of anything that would move so erraticly. It sure wasn't a bird or a plane.;37.5473346246972;-121.985918159806
2 figures and craft seen on ground near San Francisco Bay.;2007-04-26 06:45:00;5 seconds;2 figures and craft seen on ground near San Francisco Bay. I was riding my bike on Thursday (4/26/07) morning around 6:45am on the Alameda Creek trail in Fremont, CA. As I came to the end od the trial about 300 yards to where it meets the San Francisco bay, I saw 2 figures and a large object out of the corner of my eye to my right about 200 yards away.  Occasionally I am looking down at the gravel road as I am riding and as I began to look up I saw the figures. This startled me, causing me to veer into thick gravel and look away from the figures as I tried to regain control. I quickly came to a stop and looked to my right just as the figures which appeared to be looking at me turned away and began walking away as they suddenly became translucent and faded away. Immediately afterwards the large object that was about 50 feet in length which I had not focused on also became translucent and faded away.  All of this occurred in 5 seconds or less.  I do wear prescription glasses, I am near sighted, I did not have them on and I am not required to wear them while driving.  I tried to focus to see if I could still see them again but I did not. I then began to look around me as I sensed a presence near me. This spooked me and I quickly got back on my bike and began to peddle away towards the bay. I stopped about half way and began looking around again, but saw and sensed nothing. I then went to the end of the trail and waited there probably 15 minutes and was spooked again by what sounded like foots steps on the gravel. I then got back on my bike and I took the longer more difficult route along the dikes towards the Dumbarton Bridge instead of going back in the same direction that I had originally came.  I believe I had seen 3 UFOs in my life, 1 of which occurred on the Menlo Park side of the Dumbarton Bridge around the time and before the lights sighted by many in Phoenix Arizona in 1997. These lights were very similar, were south west of Menlo Park/Palo Alto. There where 5 lights all in a row and they did not move. A passenger plane also passed behind them. I did not stay long maybe a couple of minutes as I called my brother on my cell phone and left him a message telling him what I was seeing. I was very excited when I saw the original news footage covering the Phoenix Lights as it was very much what I had witnessed just a short while before.
