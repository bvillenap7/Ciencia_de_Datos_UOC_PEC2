Fireball moving across Marin sky.   ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor??  PD));2015-11-11 18:00:00;5 seconds;Fireball moving across Marin sky. I just got out of my car at my brother's house which is at the top of a hill in a residential area.  My brother confirmed that I was facing North.  I saw a white fireball move very quickly across the sky.  It appeared to travel directly East to West.  I can't say how high up it was, but it was definitely lower that a commercial airplane. Observer Background:  I'm 60 years old and the mother of an adult daughter.  I live in San Rafael, CA.  I work as an accountant at an independent school. ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor??
