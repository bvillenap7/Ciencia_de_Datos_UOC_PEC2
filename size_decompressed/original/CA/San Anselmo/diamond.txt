Close up sighting of 2 yellow orb like objects in almost broad daylight conditions;2018-02-22 18:10:00;10 minutes;Close up sighting of 2 yellow orb like objects in almost broad daylight conditions This sighting happened in broad daylight blue skies.  Two huge yellow gold objects were hovering side by side about 30 feet away from each other.  The sighting was already in progress when I arrived.  I watched these 2 huge star like objects for about 7 to 10 minutes until one of them turned off and the other continued to hover.  The other object started to strobe and slowly move to the west.  These objects looked semi-transparent and looked more like floating sheets than any kind of structured object.   I have seen so much orb and UFO activity in this month of February that it would take several reports to even talk about it.  The multi-colored orange and blue and yellowish green lights were seen on 2-08,2-09 and 2-15 for long extended periods of time hovering at tree top level in horizontal lines and V shaped formations.   A second sighting on this 2-22 night occured at approximately 9 P.M. over this Christmas Tree Hill area of Corte Madera with V formatio! ns and 2 bright gold objects side by side for several minutes just like the 6 P.M. sighting.;37.9861;-122.5688
