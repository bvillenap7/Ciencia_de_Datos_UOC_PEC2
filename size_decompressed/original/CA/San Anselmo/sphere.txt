Cluster of 8 objects is witnessed by 3 people;2017-08-30 22:00:00;45 minutes;Cluster of 8 objects is witnessed by 3 people. I was seeing multiple formations of swarming darting objects that were sometimes hovering and then would disperse like a swarm of bees.   I took a walk closer to this activity when I ran into 2 other people that were also watching the lights.  The 3 of us then witnessed a tight group of 7 to 8 objects at pretty close range.  These were the yellow-white foo fighter type lights as seen in clusters frequently around this area.   After this night within 24 hours we have this record shattering heat wave in San Francisco on 9-01 and 9-02 etc.;37.9861;-122.5688
