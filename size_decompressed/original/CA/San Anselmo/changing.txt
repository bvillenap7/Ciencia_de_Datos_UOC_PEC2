Large orange Carlos Diaz type craft  seen  along with  clusters  of  other  glowing  objects.;2014-04-20 22:00:00;3 minutes;Large orange Carlos Diaz type craft  seen  along with  clusters  of  other  glowing  objects I don't think my report went through the other day so anyway I was able to see a giant object appear through a pair of 10-50 binoculars in what looked to me as some kind of bending light beam technology.   I was on top of a mountain near Mt. Tamalpais when I saw two huge rectangular shaped lights coming tpwards me with some kind of invisible object in between.  These two lights merged into one giant light which materialized into a giant upside down funnel looking cone which next took on the shape of a domed disc which kept getting thicker on the sides and more rounded while I watched it.  It started drifting toward a nearby hill and turned into what I would have to say is the identical Carlos Diaz plasma type craft seen in Mexico.   This object next took on the shape of an oval turtle shell looking object, kind of lumpy and rigid looking before finally turning into a long glowing orange object that looked like a croissant that you would get at a bakery.  It was a blinding fluorescent orange and slightly bent at the end and seemed to drift right into this hillside or go behind it and never reappear again.  Meanwhile I was seeing clusters of these orange lights appearing over this hillside for a solid two hours that just seemed to come out od nowhere all taking on an orangish glow.   Much of these objects just looked like four pointed stars and were consistantly appearing in pairs and clusters. ((NUFORC Note:  We are unclear as to whether this is a serious report.  Witness indicates that the event took place on a date that is a week in the future.  We have amended the date, believing that he may have meant to type 20, instead of 29.  PD));37.9861;-122.5688
