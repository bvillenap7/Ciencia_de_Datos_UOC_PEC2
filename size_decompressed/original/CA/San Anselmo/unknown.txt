Bright as a distant star but moving across the whole sky on a path.;2005-05-11 21:55:00;1 minute;Bright as a distant star but moving across the whole sky on a path. I noticed an object in the sky that looked like a distant star.  It was moving very slowly across the whole sky.  Moving way too fast to be a plane/missle/helicopter.   I thought for a moment that it might be a shooting star but it was too constant in its movement to be anything natural.  Please tell me that someone else noticed this.
