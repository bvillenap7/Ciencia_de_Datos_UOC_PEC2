Red, white, changing object moving around erratically over Santa Barbara, Ventura, Ojai area;2008-07-26 00:30:00;15 minutes;Red, white, changing object moving around erratically over Santa Barbara, Ventura, Ojai area We saw a shape that seemed like it was about 50 miles away north closer to Santa Barbara.  It started as a red flickering dot that moved very easily in all directions, slowly, then fast...then it changed color to white and became a long vertical light, then blue or green...and to a tall triangle and continued to move around, but more slowly.  It mainly stayed red, but the way that it was moving was what held our attention side to side in a zigzag pattern, circular, up and down.  The whole thing lasted about 15-20 minutes until it slowly moved out of our view line.  Totally amazing sight and we have never believed in this before tonight.  There also happened to be meteor shower of some kind going on simultaneously.;34.4448231132077;-119.253947169811
