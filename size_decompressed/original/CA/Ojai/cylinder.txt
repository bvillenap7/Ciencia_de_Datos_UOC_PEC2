Silver/white cylinder object hovers then vanishes;2013-12-15 16:30:00;1 minute;Silver/white cylinder object hovers then vanishes I was driving at the time, heading North on the 33 toward Ojai, afternoon sunset behind me. Saw what looked like a plane in the sky.  It grabbed my attention because it looked taller than a commercial aircraft (as if the passenger area was 4 levels tall), and it also seemed to be moving too slowly to stay aloft.   I kept an eye on it with the understanding that it could easily be an optical illusion created by my position relative to the object.  As my physical location became clearer to see this thing, it became obvious that it was barely moving forward at all.  The size and its speed did not follow the known laws of physics.  The last moment I looked up at it, it simply became less and less opaque until it vanished from sight.  This vanishing (fading out) lasted about 2 seconds.  An interesting sighting that could be off Earth, or may be advanced military. Who knows.;34.4448231132077;-119.253947169811
