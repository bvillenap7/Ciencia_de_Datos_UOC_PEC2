Before Moon came up behind hills, I looked to the East over Topa Topa Mtn. and saw a very bright object.  My first thought was that it was a craft just hanging still in the sky - the discussion at the moment with my partner was about life in the Universe, etc. and Hope for Mankind.  It was at that moment I saw spherical light that I think became momentarily brighter ( pulsed).  I told my partner Quick Look!.  He looked then, as it began to dim - more and more dimming as it moved out and up in oblique angle --- and then disappeared.  It felt special and significant to both of us and seemed to be carrying some consiousness(subjective impressions). ((NUFORC Note:  One possible explanation is the characteristic flash of an Iridium satellite.  The www.heavens-above.com website is down at the time of this writing, so we cannot check for an Iridium sighting for this time and date.

three objects above field in ojai ca;2005-02-24 17:56:00;60 seconds;three objects above field in ojai ca driving, saw three sperical objects in the sky above some powerlines about 1/3 mile away in a field.  Thought they were aircraft power-pole safety markers at first.  They were tightly bunched, one on top, two below like a triangle.  As we got closer we could see that they were not solid, seemed to swirl and quiver like jello.  Were silverish white but changed to orangish color.   The top object shot straight up into the sky, followed by the other two following slightly slower.  Hovered very high in the sky for a few seconds then slowly started to dim/disappear.  Almost looked like baloons, but moved very fast.  There were two other cars on the road that runs parallel to the road that we were on (on the other side of the field).  Objects were closer to them than us.  Both cars stopped. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD));34.4448231132077;-119.253947169811
Red meteor like object streaking, stopping completely, looking like a satellite, then extinguishing altogether.;2010-09-20 21:08:00;4 minutes;Red meteor like object streaking, stopping completely, looking like a satellite, then extinguishing altogether. I observed a red object with a tail that traveled very quickly across sky.  It really looked like a red meteor! I expected, that as a meteor, it would quickly burn out.  However, it then stopped and stayed in one place, still red. Meanwhile the tail had vanished, and looked like a satellite.  Then it went out altogether.  Could it have been a satellite burning up?  Then why would it maintain it's red bright color, with no tail, then extinguish?    I expect that many others also saw it, as it's a pleasant night and many folks might head out for a stroll.;34.4448231132077;-119.253947169811
