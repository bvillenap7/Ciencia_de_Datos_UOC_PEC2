In 1987 a UFO passed a few feet above our car near old Creek Road in Ojai, CA.;1987-01-15 00:00:00;A few seconds;In 1987 a UFO passed a few feet above our car near old Creek Road in Ojai, CA. Some time in 1987 my wife, childeren and I were driving home at night along Old Creek road in Ojai California. I was shocked to see a glowing object pass a few feet above our car. I was so socked I woke my wife and childeren but they never got a chance to get a look at it. Although it was just a few seconds, the object appeared to be emitting a faint red light and I could see it rotating (reminded me of the rotating craft in Close Encounters of the Third Kind movie) as it went over the hills. Strangest thing I've ever seen in my life, I'll never forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.4448231132077;-119.253947169811
Caught (something) on video!!;2011-10-22 14:05:00;3-5 minutes;Caught (something) on video!! (goto http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeQtnheMM6c for a small portion of the video)  I was in Ventura County California and in broad daylight(2PM PST - 10/22/11) I witnessed first what looked like a ball of neon blue light as bright a giant star, to my north-east, moving slowly across the fully lit sky moving north.  My first instinct was something from space falling to earth, like a meteor but it surprised me that it was moving so slow and I was able to see it in the daytime.  After 30 seconds I suddenly noticed there were many more of these lights (around at least 6-10)across a good portion of the sky northeast of me, all moving north.  Its kinda funny, I kept thinking to myself wow these things are so bright how could I keep losing sight of them and as soon as I'd think that they'd be gone and I have to refocus my eyes to find them.  They were barely pinpoints in the sky but they were super bright.  What really stood out to me at this point was 3 lights that were in a triangle formation(I will admit at this point I was seriously contemplating if they were UFO's)  The leading light was bright red(I remember thinking it was the color of those tiny little red mites you find in grass).  This was the only red light I saw.  I ran in, got my camera, and filmed about a minute and a half of, what before editing looks like, a blank sky.  Because it was so bright outside I didn't realize what I had caught on video until I edited the brightness/contrast the next day.  After what I saw I don't know what it is.  My best guess is I filmed a satellites reentry into the atmosphere.(a faulty German satllelite was supposed to fall to earth later that evening over the Indian Ocean/Thailand around 7 hours later and, as of yet, there have been no sightings and it been almost two weeks)  Whatever it was changed speed and at one point one even appeared to stop, and on the video one appears to split into two lights, and one of those split into two.
