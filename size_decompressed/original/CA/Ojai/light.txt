This siting occurred on Besant Road, in Miners Oaks, a part of Ojai, CA at approximately 10 p.m. in the evening on May 27th, 2002, Memorial Day. Weather conditions were quite clear, beautiful stars and a nearly full moon just rising.  There was some humidity in the atmosphere that gave a slight halo to the moon, as well as to the object of interest soon to appear. My girlfriend and I took an evening walk, looking at the stars, waking east, with the moon just peaking through the silhouettes of trees ahead and to the right a few degrees.  We were discussing the large amount of water/ice just discovered on mars. I was just commenting about how the prospect of life on other planets would affect many people's religious beliefs and how it would shake up the world …when my girlfriend called out for me to look up …and said that she had just seen a big pulse of light! I looked and saw a very bright star or planet, brighter that any object in the sky with the exception of the moon.  It had a small visible halo, the only planet besides the moon that did, and was basically a very brilliant single white or yellow/white light.  There was no blinking or movement. At first I thought maybe this was the ISS reflecting or a possibly very large satellite. From the time I saw it, the light sat frozen in place for what seemed at least 5 seconds, then suddenly it began to move.  Its intensity began to dim quickly, the halo vanished, and then it then appeared more similar to a satellite in motion, except that it reduced in size very quickly, so quickly that in approximately than 5 seconds it was gone completely. To the eye it appeared to be going away very fast from the earth's surface. Specifically, I was facing east and the object was positioned overhead and forward some, maybe 10 degrees East from directly overhead and slightly to my left or North, surrounded by a group of stationary stars. It moved diagonally toward my right and forward or in a generally southeast direction slightly, and at the same time outward very fast. It was positioned near a small cluster of stars, maybe three or four fairly bright ones, but none comparing to it in intensity.  They were my reference for the object's motion. The total length of its movement in the horizontal plane appeared to be less than 10 degrees while the movement outward appeared infinite. Note: My girlfriend previously submitted a report to you which I have not seen. ((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station passed over Ojai, CA, at 21:17 hrs. on this date.

Luminiscent lights dancing in front of large cloud bank.;2004-05-22 22:45:00;1 hour;Luminiscent lights dancing in front of large cloud bank. I live on the side of a mountain in Ojai and have a clear view of the entire valley and the night sky.  This is a remote area and at 10:45 pm there is no ambient light. I stepped out on to my porch and looked up at the night sky.  There was a huge cloud bank covering half the sky.  In front of the cloud bank were 5 maybe six very large luminiscent sheets of light.  These translucent forms danced and darted around the night sky and then all of them came together.  After a couple seconds of being together, they would shoot out of the center and dance around the sky again, then back to the center. Each explosion from the center started a new direction for each light. This lasted for about an hour.  It slowly diminished, to 4, then 3, 2,1 and then gone. And so was the large cloud bank. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length via telephone, and found her to be quite sincere, and quite lucid and objective in her description of the events she addresses above.  We do not know what it was she witnessed.  PD));34.4448231132077;-119.253947169811
