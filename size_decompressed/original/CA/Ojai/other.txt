I was outside playing some basketball with my little cousin when I look up toward my house I see this blue streak that was a definite object. It looked exactly like the ship from the last scene of M.I.B 2 that is driven ny Will Smith but it was blue. I didn't notice that till after my grandpa died. He was the only one too believe me. I don't expect anyone too believe this but it only matters if I believe it. THe only two explanations that were possible to rule out was an alien space ship or a really advanced jet made by human beings. It was going about 6 g's and about a 100 yrds away from me and about 60 yrds from the roof of my house. This object left a very long trail that dipersed all most instantly behind it. This was the most memorable 15 seconds of my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.4448231132077;-119.253947169811
