oval white light in sky just offshore of Moss Landing, CA;2006-11-23 16:00:00;20 min;oval white light in sky just offshore of Moss Landing, CA i was at the beach on thanksgiving day, late afternoon, with a friend, taking photos. i am a photographer and wanted to catch some beach shots. i noticed an oval white light in the sky near the power plant while I was photographing the plant.   Shortly after, I saw the same object about a mile offshore. i could see the buoy marker in the water. The object was at about a 45 degree point in the sky.  i watched it appear suddenly, remain stationary for a few seconds, then zip up and over a few hundred yards, then again the other direction. It disappeared suddenly, then reappeared further away, just left of it's previous position.  As it moved/reappeared, i photographed it.  It is clearly visible. It appears smaller when it is further away, and is fairly horizontal most of the time, then diagonal at one point.  The sun had just set, it was not the sun, or the moon (the moon is visible in the photos, barely a crescent, NOT an oval, not like the object=NOT a camera reflection).  I am very familiar with lens flare and camera reflection, and it is neither.  I watched the object with my own eyes, between photographing it.   It appears on the photos, 35mm, and negatives, very clearly, and is not a camera or developing error. The location was the beach at Moss Landing, near the Monterey Research Institute, a large power plant, and marina.  When the object was over the ocean, I was facing with my back to the facilities. It was not a reflection or anomilie from either one. At times it appeared to change shape within itself, becoming a sphere within an oval, but it was always a white light, from what I could see, and photographed. There was no noticable sound.;36.8122;-121.7769
