From a hilltop of approx 1300 ft alt. I observed to the east, a contrail that was an inturruped stream of Puffs, I am an aircraft fan, and having seen the same contrail in preceeding weeks, photographed with my disposable camera, what I deduced was an experimental aircrafts trail.  When the photographs were developed, I was suprised to see what appeared to be a winged flying pole. It did not appear to be connected to the contrail I had observed. I showed the photo to some at my workplace on 10/29.  They told me the same object had been seen on a news story on local channell 8 news on 10/28. It appears to be an identical object.;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186
