The reasion I stoped and looked was becaue about 6 months ago I saw a light the exzact shape and color that was flying close to my house and acting very strage. I was watching this object and it just seemed to be moving around in maybe a circular pattern would be the best way to describe it but really no set path and then I saw it appear to drop stuff. The object its self is a bright orange ball. If you took like one of the lamps off a police chopper in the front but had a orange tint to it thats what this looks like and makes no sound. It was too high to be a chopper because my estemations it was at over 30,000 feet for over 5 min so it couldnt be a chopper because the air is too thin to run the engines that high. But it appeared to drop objects from the circle, the best way to describe it was it looked like slag (the hot pieces of metal that come off from welding) was falling off of it. It did that about 3 times then it dissapeared for about 30 sec to a minute then it came back droped another piece of slag then it dissapeared for good.

Balls of Fire  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness, a student, elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));2005-02-24 13:30:00;5 mins.;Balls of Fire I was with  my cousin, walkin outside when we heard the sound of a glass breaking. We turned our heads the left and saw what appeared to be two circles of fire in the sky. We were in a shock because we did not know what had just happened. The UFO's did a circle in the sky then one of them streaked across the sky left a trail of smoke and disappeared. The other one hovered for about 5 seconds and streaked the other way left a trail of smoke and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness, a student, elects to remain totally anonymous.

Bright orange object;2012-04-09 12:05:00;15:00;bright orange object While driving home from the post office I noticed a bright orange stationary light in the sky to the left of me over I would estimate be Carlsbad,Ca.  I pulled over to watch the orange light as it flickered like a candle and was very bright and did not move at all.  Then it slowly faded out until it was not visable( not too sure but I thought I saw it shoot straight up with tremendous speed after it went dark). After that I get in the car and drive back home and call my fiance and tell her.  She then tells me she sees the same light over oceanside, ca about 15 to 20 miles north of where I saw the object.  I rush home and see the object again reappear and disappear several times.  One strange thing did happen and it was that after it disappeared one time it reappeared right after it disappeared for a few seconds then was gone again.  Whatever it was would like to know( I would count flares out because of no smoke trail and how it re-appeared after disappearing ! right away).;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186
Group of 10-15 small circular lights in San Marcos.;2016-11-19 20:00:00;30 minutes;Group of 10 -15 small circular lights in San Marcos. I was sitting in the courtyard of my building lit by a few lights on a small walkway on a cloudy night around 8pm when I saw a number of small perfectly circular lights flying thru the clouds above the buildings where I live, opposite the mountains in San Marcos, CA.  There were almost 10 to 15 of them.  There were 3 or 4 of them coming together at a central point at a time, then spreading out in all different directions, and then came back together again to the center.  Sometimes only 2 or 3 came together, sometimes 5 or more did.  They flew around quickly very fast, for over 30 minutes.  Then they just started flying around in circles individually and not coming together anymore.;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186
