It disappeard, & thought nothing of it. I looked out side again & there it was.  What I though was the wind blowing the trees making it appear & disappear.  Looked more like a light blinking off and on. There was no wind.  I looked away & it was gone.  I looked out side again & there was a bright light in a different place.  I watched it & realized it was hovering and the light around it seemed to be circling it, as in movement, very high & moving a little, & asked my boyfriend to look.  He also saw it moving.  I watched it as is slowly moved out of sight. The object was very far away & was very hard to tell what shape it was.  There was a light that looked to be circling the out side of it, because it wasn't completely lit on what looked to be the top & bottom of it.  It also seem to have a main light that circled it.  It moved in up & down & side to side & hovering motions. The light would be very dim at times & very bright at others.  It gradually, slowly moved in a wesward direction, on the same plane of travel.;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186
Bright green in formation --others smaller following.;2003-08-23 21:10:00;about 10 minutes;Bright green in formation --others smaller following. It started out as 6 bright green lights in a round shape coming over the house from the Northwest heading toward the Southeast. As they were passing, at least a couple dozen  more, but higher up and smaller came over and split off in different directions.  The original ones kept going and finally disappeared from sight.  But we could still see some of the others.  We concentrated on a grouping of 5.  They were pretty high, but we could still see the green color.  They stopped and moved toward each other.  Then they seperated and seemed to follow each other. Then they disappeared.  Their speed was faster than an airplane, and on the right direction for a satelite. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally lucid and objective about the sighting she and her husband experienced.  We suspect they are highly credible witnesses.  Also, we received another telephoned message of a sighting from the San Diego area, close to San Marcos, for the same night, but the witness failed to leave her telephone number, so we were unable to return the call.

Orange Light over Highway 78;2004-11-25 23:15:00;1-2 Minutes;Orange Light over Highway 78 I was alone outside on my deck looking up at the sky and east towards Escondido. I live directly under the flight path for Palomar Airport and I'm accustomed to seeing aircraft flying overhead as they make their approached. I looked up in the distance and I saw one little light in the distance.  It was bright orange and appeared to be stationary or moving very slowly over highway 78. I was very puzzled what this could be? A plane or helicopter would have distinctive flashing lights, but this was just one orange light all by itself and no aircraft attached to it! After a minute the light seemed to drop in heighth and disappeared from my view heading in a southeast direction. I dont know if I saw a UFO, but it definitely was out of the ordinary and now I'm going to look at the night skies a lot more and keep my camera handy!;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186

The fact i have seen this thing drop something...which does worry me;2013-07-26 21:30:00;3 minutes;the fact i have seen this thing drop something...which does worry me we first noticed a round red light kind of flashing dimly coming from the San Marcos area where we see planes fly on their route, but this one was coming toward us slowly then stopped .. it started to pulse slowly and dimly while two others where below it.   An airplane flew over the first one before we saw the other two. then what looked like the first one dropped something bright straight down very fast then slowly dimmed out or faded out, as one by one the other two flashed dimly and faded.   This isn't the first time we have seen this but its the first time we seen more then one. I watch the sky at night allot not long but to see and I always find something odd.;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186

Hovering and Accelerating Multi-colored Light.;2014-08-22 20:15:00;15 minutes;Hovering and Accelerating Multi-colored Light. While relaxing in a Jacuzzi, I spotted a bluish circular light with subtle orange/greenish/reddish colors moving straight down a hillside (Emerald Heights near Indian Rock: also known as “Bear and Cub”).  It looked very strange to be a car or helicopter since I see them all the time along that hillside.  Then the light moved in a horizontal direction left, hovered there for a while and then right. It would pick up speed as it accelerated and then smoothly come to a stop each time it changed course.   Then I thought that maybe somebody had a sophisticated laser device having some fun. But then the light moved vertical again going above the hillside in to open air.   The light did not dissipate in luminance or outline, which I thought was too strange to be a laser since the sky probably couldn’t create a perfect solid backdrop.   It continued this type of acceleration and directional pattern for about ten minutes, when I decided to go get a video camera.   By the time ! I got back (three minutes later or so), the object disappeared as I was setting up the camera (proper lighting).   This is no hoax!;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186
One light would get brighter (bigger), while this happened the other got less bright (smaller). The lights were a yellow/gold.;2014-08-25 22:28:00;40-60 seconds;I went to pick my roommate up from the Sprinter train station.  First day of school.  He didn’t know that the sprinter didn’t run that late at night.   He told me he saw two circular lights hovering around the P, on top of the Palomar hill.  One light would get brighter (bigger), while this happened the other got less bright(smaller).  The lights were a yellow (goldish) color.

Sudden Green/Blue flash over entire sky with source in the west toward the coast in Oceanside-Carlsbad.;2017-04-10 19:00:00;<5 seconds;Sudden Green/Blue Flash over entire sky with source in the west toward the coast in Oceanside-Carlsbad I was standing outside discussing a car accident with my neighbor.  Many neighbors were outside.  I was facing west, the sun had just set, and the sky lit up green/blue for a few seconds.  With the source over by the coast in what looked to be the Carlsbad and Oceanside Area.  Was over very suddenly. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible green meteor, we wonder?  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  PD));33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186
