I noticed the aircraft first, it was hoovering over the freeway about 300-400 feet.. It was not so much a circle, but it had a solid line of red lights on the back of it. It had 4 bright white lights in the front with one brighter then the other 3. We pulled off at the next exit and came back around, by this time it was heading south pretty fast. The time it took for us to catch up to it, it was already gone. No moutain ranges so we would have seen it flying away but it was gone in less then 4 seconds. I don't know what we saw butt it couldn't have been military because Camp Pendelton was about 15 minutes North of us. The object went South, down the coast.;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186
Out of this world looking craft!;2010-04-06 20:57:00;30 seconds;Out of this world looking craft ! What we saw tonight was unlike anything we have ever seen before in our life. My mother was upstairs when she summoned me to come up and look at something. I went upstairs and she pointed out at the window. I was startled at what I saw. It looked like a huge craft with 5 or 6 bright lights in an oval shape and made out of individual boxes. It was hovering or moving very slowly to the West near Washingtonia Dr and Cocos lane in San Marcos. I knew instantly that this was something very strange indeed!  I ran downstairs to grab my camera and ran outside but it was gone. My mother said it left just a few seconds after I went downstairs.  I have seen a variety of craft but never anything like this. I'm a pilot and know what conventional aircraft look like and this was nothing in any way conventional! It look like something completely out of this world and I so wish I could have snapped a picture of it or maybe someone in San Marcos or north San Diego county saw i! t too hopefully.;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186
