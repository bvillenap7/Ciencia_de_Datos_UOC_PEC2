Captured on film 9/16/02 Southern California Sky;2002-09-16 04:15:00;1 1/2hrs at least;Captured on film 9/16/02 Southern California Sky My friend called me outside after a flash of light in the sky caught his attention. Reluctantly I followed and I will describe it as a circular light that at times changes colors to red or green and it jumps from a spec of light to a very big flash of light and when it does enlarge for those brief moments there is a lot of detail that is visible.  It almost seems translucent.  My friend and I both had video camera's on hand which is strange in itself as we don't go around with camera's typically.  My point is that we have never reported a sighting before and never went looking for this to happen but look forward to someone telling us what this is on our film. One more detail to add is that when we both were looking in our viewfinders recording it...at times you would think we were zooming in and out when we were not.  That is how much it would enlarge then shrink.;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186
