Moving lights with very bright colors moving from horizon to horizon.;2003-08-23 23:00:00;15 minutes;Moving lights with very bright colors moving from horizon to horizon. At approximately 10:50 PM I saw a faint blue hazy object in a westerly direction. I thought it was unusual and continued to watch and realized that it was moving in my direction. I watched the object continuously for about 15 minutes only leaving twice. Once to get my wife and the once to get binocculars. As it got nearer, the object appeared brighter (no doubt because of its proximity) and also other colors were evident. I waited too long to look at it with binocculars but when I did was suprised at the richness of the color. The front was a deep blue approaching violet. The center was a brilliant green and the back was a deep red. It was difficult to perceive any definite shape. There appeared to be at least a dozen lights within the colors but didn't appear to be the source of the color. It's important to note that the colors I saw didn't look like a reflection off of any kind of fusalage but rather appeared as a glow like one would observe from neon. The object made no noise, didn't change direction, speed or altitude. The lights didn't change in intensity nor did they blink. I am posting this after having read another post from my town around the same time. I think they entered the time wrong, however. http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30886.html Also, because of the time of the sighting and the direction it was going, I think the sighting of an object in Mt Laguan at 12:10 that morning may somehow be related. http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30871.html I do have a posting on the internet for the next morning at an independent source so it can be verified that I reported this before reading the the other sightings in the area.;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186
enormous size blue ufo followed over 3 cities;2004-12-21 06:30:00;20 mins;enormous size blue ufo followed over 3 cities started out on a ride to pick up a friend when i saw a blue glowing UFO with white strobe on top hovering over apart of the city in background at which i made my gf pull over and we watched for a min as it went further behind a mountain. a few moments later i said lets go try to get close to it babe see if we cant get a good picture  at that point she said i dont want to be close to a ufo . but i convinced her to get onto the free way which we got onto and did not see this object we got off on a part of the city where it had a freeway overpass which i ended up seeing the object further down the freeway over the hill almost at the 78 freeway and 15 freeway merge at that time i found the disposable camera we always keep in the car we merged onto the 15 where it was going over a hill crossing the 15 south freeway slowing down cars before you hit the north county fair mall when object stopped moving accross free way and went back over near the hill at that point i tried taking a picture of it in distance which i am developing pictures tomorrow we tried to follow the craft for about 15-20 minutes then it disapeared behind some mountains in rancho bernado by the del dios highway behind some very dark black mountains...  the object headed east from what apeared lake san marcos area and moved from that location almost over the cement companys area and then over del dios high school area then south towards mira mar over mountains me and my girlfriend do not know what to think of this instance because sightings in this area have been occuring more often and we believe people have the right to know.... thanks;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186
black mass hovering/circling slowly in sky with white lights & white aura.;2019-02-24 17:36:00;15 minutes;black mass hovering/circling slowly in sky with white lights &white aura. We noticed a bunch of black objects in the sky.  one up close and 3 or 4 more in the distance, the ones in the distance proceeded to go off and up into the distance/sky and disappear. the one larger one got closer to where we were and it looked as though it was like a person standing and squatting....but in like a aircraft shape ,reminded us of like a man with a cape or a demeanor from Harry potter, but not because it was all black with white lights on it and it gave off a white aura/force field looking glow around it.and it just spun in circles opening and closing .I'm assuming it was quite large from the side I was seeing it and where it was in the sky.  and it slowly as it spun moved counter clockwise.  it was in the southern area of my yard and when it finally started going outward into the distance it had moved to the eastern side of my yard. the other ones that started with it never returned nor did we see this again. and my friend was recording on his phone also and his phone would go blurry when mine would, also even thru binoculars it would at times appear blurry when it would cause the blur on the phones also there was an occasional red light.;33.1247691860466;-117.179476744186
