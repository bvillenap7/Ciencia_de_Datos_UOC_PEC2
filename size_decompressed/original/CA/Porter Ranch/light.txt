Extremely bright yellow-orange light zipping across the San Fernando Valley.;2004-10-03 20:10:00;1 minute;Extremely bright yellow-orange light zipping across the San Fernando Valley. I live in Porter Ranch in the Santa Susana Mountains on the northwestern end of the San Fernando Valley. Tonight at about 8:10 PM in the southern sky halfway between the horizon and zenith I saw a large very very bright yellow-orange light. With my arm fully extended and my thumb up against the light, it was about 1/4 the width of my thumb. It surprised me to be where it was, I was not aware of any planet or star of such magnitude in that part of the sky. It was not flashing as an airplane light would. I then noticed that it was slowly moving further south and then shooting up into the sky and becoming a white pinpoint of light as it continued traveling south across the San Fernando Valley. It finally grew too faint to see through the city lights. There was no sound. The incident lasted about 60 seconds.;34.2601;-118.5789
White object streaked across sky, broke apart, and crashed in Porter Ranch, CA;2010-02-03 19:25:00;2 seconds;White object streaked across sky, broke apart, and crashed in Porter Ranch, CA I was stuck in traffic along I-5 in the San Fernando valley near Pacoima, CA. I noticed a bright white streak going from west to north over the Santa Susana mountains above Porter Ranch, CA.  It was breaking up and the pieces were leaving their own white streaks behind.  The object was traveling at tremendous speed as it went from the western horizon to the north in less than 2 seconds.  It appeared to be headed below the mountains in Porter Ranch not over them.  I believe that it crashed in Porter Ranch.;34.2601;-118.5789
