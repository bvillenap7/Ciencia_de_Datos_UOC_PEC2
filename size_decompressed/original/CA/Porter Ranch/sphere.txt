Stationery pulsating jellyfish like object flashing purple, green, white and red lights over San Fernando Valley April 12, 2008;2008-04-12 23:50:00;1 hour +;Stationery pulsating jellyfish like object flashing purple, green, white and red lights over San Fernando Valley April 12, 2008 My husband & I arrived home about 11:40 p.m. on 4/12/08 from a night out of bowling and proceeded upstairs to bed.  I opened the sliding glass door in our bedroom because of the nice breeze & temperature outside and noticed what looked like a flickering star but it was flickering purple & green & white.  So I went and got the binoculars and went out on the balcony and sat down in a chair and steadied the binoculars on the railing and saw what I would best describe as an object that was stationary but pulsating different very brightly colored lights, blue, green, purple, white & red - the object looked very much like the body part of a jelly fish without the tentacles.  I watched as it at first looked like a circle with lights all the way around, and then it seemed to tilt on its side and looked like a see-through dome on top.  I watched this for 10 minutes and had my husband look through the binoculars and verify that I wasn't making this up!  I then called a girlfriend of mine at 12:05 a.m. who lives 2 minutes away and she hopped in her car and came right over.  She also saw the same thing I was seeing, although we did notice that, although appearing to be probably 25,000 to 35,000 ft. in the sky, it looked to be above a mountain in the Sylmar area that has some kind of buildings with lights at the top of it.  But there was no beam of light coming from any of those lights on the mountain to what we were seeing in the sky.  It is now 12:55 a.m. and it is still in the same spot.  It is now almost 1:00 a.m. and it is still there!!!  I will look again tomorrow evening and see if it is up there again, then maybe I will believe it is somehow tied to the lights on the mountain.  If anyone could shed any light on what those buildings are at the top of those mountains perhaps that could narrow this down to a logical explanation.  But I have never in my life seen anything remotely like this up in the sky!!;34.2601;-118.5789
Witnessed red sphere traveling low, silent at very high rate of speed across valley at 2:00 a.m.;2012-11-13 02:00:00;3-4 seconds;Witnessed red sphere traveling low, silent at very high rate of speed across valley at 2:00 a.m. Upon awakening at 2:15 a.m., I was looking out a window, North facing in my house. I then witnessed what appeared to be a small, bright red sphere flying very low (approx 300-400')in a NW direction.  This object was NOT man-made.  It traveled silently in an extreme straight attitude and traveled in what I estimate 2-3 miles in about 4 seconds. I live high on a hill.  The most remarkable thing about my sighting is speed and attitude of the object. Straight as can be fast, silent.;34.2601;-118.5789
