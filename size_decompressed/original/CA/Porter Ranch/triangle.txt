Red flashing lights in porter ranch seen by security.;2016-11-07 17:49:00;18:00;Red flashing lights in porter ranch seen by security. At 5:49 pm, I heard a loud hovering sound in the sky when I looked up I saw red flashing lights in a triangle shape, the hovering sound lasted for 4 minutes but the red flashing lights lasted for about 6 minutes when I grabbed my phone to record it  the red flashing lights were gone but I did see some white hovering lights in a triangle shape then it disappeared   it looked like the lights are hovering above the 118 freeway  Before I heard the noise I felt strange but after the noise and lights disappeared I felt better and I noticed scratches on my right arm;34.2601;-118.5789
