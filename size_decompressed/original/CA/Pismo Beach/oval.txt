GLOWING LIGHT OVER PIZMO BEACH PIER ON NEW YEAR'S EVE.;2000-12-31 20:00:00;20 minutes;GLOWING LIGHT OVER PIZMO BEACH PIER ON NEW YEAR'S EVE. MY FAMILY AND I WERE VISITING PISMO BEACH ON NEW YEAR'S EVE.  WE WERE WALKING BACK TO OUR HOTEL ALONG THE PIER WALKWAY AT ABOUT 8:00PM WHEN I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT COMING FROM THE EAST (OVER THE CITY OF PISMO)  I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS A HELICOPTER BECAUSE I SAW OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA AND IT WAS MOVING ABOUT THE SAME SPEED, BUT THE GLOW OF THIS OBJECT WAS MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER AIRCRAFT.  AS I  WATCHED IT COME CLOSER, I JOKINGLY TOLD MY FAMILY LOOK AT THE FUNNY LOOKING UFO COMINGTHIS WAY.  IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 1200 FEET ABOVE US, MOVING TOWARDS THE OCEAN.  MY MOTHER AND FATHER IN-LAW COMMENTED IT LOOKED LIKE THEY PUT CHRISTMAS LIGHTS ON A HELICOPTER. THE LIGHTS WERE GROWING BRIGHTER THEN DIMMING AS IT WENT PASSED THE PISMO BEACH PIER.   WE COULD NOT HERE THE SOUND OF ANY ENGINES OR HELICOPTER BLADES.  THE OBJECT ALL OF A SUDDEN, STOPPED, TURNED A LITTLE TO THE NORTH AND THEN HOVERED IN ONE SPOT. WE WATCHED AS IT CONTINUED TO GLOW AND DIM, BY THEN ANOTHER FAMILY OF FIVE WERE CURIOUS AS TO WHAT WE WERE ALL SEEING.  THEN WE SAW SOMETHING OR SOMEONE FALLING FROM THE OBJECT.  IT WAS ALSO GLOWING LIKE FLAME, POSSIBLY BURNING FUEL OR MATERIAL.  IT DROPPED THIS MATERIAL TWO OR THREE TIMES, THEN THE OBJECT GLOWED AND DIMMED A FEW TIMES AND FINALLY WENT COMPLETELY OUT.   IT KEPT THE SAME ALTITUDE AND POSITION BUT DISAPPEARED.  THE HALF LIT MOON GAVE OFF ENOUGH LIGHT TO SEE THE SURF AND SEA BELOW THE OBJECT, BUT WE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING SPLASH DOWN OR LAND ON THE OCEAN.  MY TWO DAUGHTERS AND NIECE WERE ALSO THERE.  MY DAUGHTER AND NIECE AGREE THEY SAW TWO SETS OF THREE LIGHTS ON THE SIDE OF THE OBJECT, AND THAT'S WHERE THE GLOW WAS COMING FROM.  I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE SAW, BUT I CAN SAY FOR SURE IT WAS NOT A PLANE, HELICOPTER OR METEOR. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness submitted second, revised statement, which follows.  PD)) THIS WAS NOT A PLANE OR HELICOPTER/ WE WERE AT PISMO BEACH PIER ON NEW YEAR'S EVE AT ABOUT 8:00 pm WHEN WE SAW A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT COMING OVER THE CITY OF PISMO, WE THOUGHT IT WAS A HELICOPTER, BUT THE LIGHTS WE GLOWING ORANGE &  WHITE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE OBJECT.  IT WAS POSSIBLY 500 FEET ABOVE THE CITY.  AS IT HOVERED OVER US WE COULD NOT HERE THE SOUND OF ANY PLANE ENGINE OR HELICOPTER BLADES.  IT HEADED OVER THE BEACH AND ABOUT 500-1000 FEET BEYOND THE PIER AND AT THE SAME ALTITUDE AND STOPPED COMPLETELY.  IT BEGAN TO GET BRIGHTER THEN DIM OVER & OVER AGAIN,  THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE SAW SOMETHING FALLING FROM THE OBJECT.  IT APPEARED TO BE ON FIRE LIKE DRIPPING MATERIAL OR FUEL ON FIRE.  IT DID THIS TWO OR THREE TIMES AND THE OBJECT KEPT DIMMING AND GLOWING. THE HALF LIT MOON LIT THE OCEAN ENOUGH FOR US TO SEE IF ANYTHING FELL TO THE SEA, BUT WE DID NOT SEE ANYONE OR ANYTHING SPLASH DOWN.  THE OBJECT FINALLY DIMMED OUT COMPLETELY.  I READ A SIGHTING REPORT FROM A WOMAN IN WOODLAND CALIFORNIA THAT SEEMED TO BE VERY CLOSE TO OUR SIGHTING.  I AM NOT SURE WHERE WOODLAND IS IN CONJUCTION WITH PISMO BEACH BUT CAN YOU CHECK TO SEE IF VANDENBURG MAY HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH SOMETHING.  I HAVE 12 WITNESSES. MY HUSBAND, MY TWO DAUGHTERS, MY NIECE, MY FATHER & MOTHER IN LAW AND A FAMILY OF 5 STANDING NEXT TO US.  PLEASE EMAIL ME @ ((e-address deleted));35.1611;-120.6495
