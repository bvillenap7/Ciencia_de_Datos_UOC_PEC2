It was not jet exaust, it was fire.  And the fire looked like it had debris or bits and pieces of something in it including red and blue lit peices.  The fire left a strange trail of debris.  My passenger asked is it launching a satalite?.  The object looked like only about 1,000 feet above and infront of us.  I pulled over on the side of the freeway and opened the moon-roof of the car and watched the object.  Fire continued coming from it as it moved slowley westword.  At first I thought it was a plane coming apart because of the debris coming from it and the fire.  At one point an object came out of the fire and consisted of 6 or 8 blue lights in a line (or around it).  The fire object bagan to move faster and faster and turned upword and began gaining altitude upward and away from us.  We watched it until it turned into a tiny speck and we could not see it anymore.  The blue-lite object remained stationary, and we left.  I am an avaiation buff and I am aware of most all aircraft.  This was nothing like anything I have ever seen or heard of before.;35.1611;-120.6495
