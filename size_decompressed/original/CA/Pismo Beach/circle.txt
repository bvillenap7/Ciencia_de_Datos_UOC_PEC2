1 orange circle zig zagging at a very fast pace across the night sky above the ocean changing direction often.  ((NUFORC:  Sirius??));2003-01-01 05:00:00;30-45 min;1 orange circle zig zagging at a very fast pace across the night sky above the ocean changing direction often While visiting pismo beach for new years with a group of friends, we stayed in a hotel suite with a patio overlooking the ocean.  Around 5:00am everyone fell asleep except me. I wasn't very tired so I decided to grab a blanket and lounge on the patio over looking the ocean.  It was still dark outside, and I was deep in thought when suddenly I noticed a small orange circle in the sky. I thought it was a star but then as I stared at it I realized that it was moving. It was zig zagging all over the sky at a very fast pace changing its direction often.  I was so stunned, to scared to move or blink. I just layed there frozen following it with my eyes. At some points it would go so far away that it was barely visible but then suddenly it would change direction and zig zag its way back to my direction.  I layed there watching it for about 45 minutes to an hour until the sun came up and it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at the star, Sirius.
