My husband's friend was with his granddaughter and her boyfriend  flying his drone when they saw a triangular shaped craft in the clouds at a very high altitude higher than normal planes fly while approaching Sacramento Airport in the area.  It was reflecting the sun as it flew from cloud to cloud in a circular pattern.  They watched it with binoculars for about 45 minutes and could tell it was not a jet although it was about the same size.  I jokingly asked him if he experienced any missing time and he said no.  Altitude was much higher than the drone's 1000 feet.  I have urged our friend to make his own report I'm a MUFON member and this sighting was too good not to report second hand.;38.5671474358975;-121.551737179487
