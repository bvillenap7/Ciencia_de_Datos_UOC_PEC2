Not a plane as first thought.No sound.Unusual  red glow ..nothing like the standard warning light of planes.  Vanished after maybe 30 seconds..blacked out?  This was the first with any lights, colored or otherwise that i've noticed..  most if not all previous unknown craft i've noticed were merely reflecting light [whitish]then they lost the reflections and vanished [blacked out].. very unusual!

Unknown lighted or reflecting white-ish object traveling NW to SE, no sound,no red FAA required beacon lite;2013-06-21 22:25:00;30 seconds;Unknown lighted or reflecting whiiitish object traveling NW to SE,no sound,no red FAA required beacon lite whitish light or reflection on unknown object traveling from NW to SE at approx 5000 feet altitude.  An incoming jet was approaching the Sac Int airport and was just below..the pilot must have seen this as well as Air Traffic Control. Object dissappeared as it had no lights to the rear and certainly no red warning beacon as required by FAA.  No sound eminating!   Very close proximity  to that incoming jetliner and had they been at the same elevation, a collision would have occurred.  I have seen this same or similar illuminated craft at least 4 times in as many years.;38.5671474358975;-121.551737179487
