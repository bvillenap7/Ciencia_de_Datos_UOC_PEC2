T;2004-08-03 02:00:00;Split Second;It left skid marks in the sky with a trail of smoke. It was a blue light of a flash which I thought were fireworks that never popped. The blue flash seemed to appear rising up in the sky for a split second and then peeled out into hyper space like the millinium falcon.  I know i was not the only witness since I was driving on the freeway about a mile from the Harbor Blvd. exit in West Sacramento along with two freight trucks and at least a half dozen cars within a mile radius. But I would be a fool to call this occurence extra-terrestrial. Maybe some government is testing nuclear missiles, I'm not sure but something happened on August 3rd, Tuesday at about 2 am near the Harbor Blvd exit in West Sacramento, Ca. I need a second opinion.;38.5671474358975;-121.551737179487
