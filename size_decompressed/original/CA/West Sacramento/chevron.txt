Lights in a chevron shape flying over West Sacramento, CA;2014-12-23 22:15:00;5-7 seconds;Lights in a chevron shape flying over West Sacramento, CA I saw 4-5 lights in a chevron shape fly above a layer of clouds.  I only saw the lights and could net see any shape to whatever the lights were attached.  The lights were somewhat dim due to the cloud layer.  It was completely silent and flew northwest and then made a sharp turn to the northeast.  It flew faster than the commercial airliners the regularly fly over my house.  No one was present with me.  This is the third time I have seen such a craft.  Twice, my ex-wife and I saw one fly over the family student housing complex for the University of California, Berkeley, when I was in attending school there (the housing complex is in Albany, CA, and I reported these sightings to this website too).  I think these were in May 2002 and May 2003.  In those cases, I could see the craft.;38.5671474358975;-121.551737179487
