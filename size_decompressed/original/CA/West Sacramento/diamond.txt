It was between a triangle of three stars straight above me. I looked up and I saw an orange light kind of triangular shaped. As soon as I looked up at it the lights turned off on it and that I couldn't see it anymore. I don't know how long it it been there I'm just surprised that I caught it.;38.5671474358975;-121.551737179487
