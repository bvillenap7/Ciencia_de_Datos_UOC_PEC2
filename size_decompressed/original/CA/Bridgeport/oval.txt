At 2:20 while searching for the bear with my night vision with inferred, with weak batteries.  My nephew with high intensity light was sweeping the area, when I saw an orb hovering 8 feet off the ground about 150 feet away.  The orb was the size of a baseball.  I told my nephew to hold the light in place, as I observed the orb which my nephew could not see with his light.  It moved to right out of the beam of light, I then told my nephew to move the light just to right.  I observed the orb again, and this time it knew I was on to it and scattered away.  I saw the same type of orb in 8/20/2006 and reported 8/29/2006 to the NUFORC.  These orbs from a distant are fainted light, but up close as I saw in 2006 with night vision, which you see thing in phosphorus green.  It showed that it was violet and plasma blue, over riding the phosphorus green.  The astronauts in the shuttle took video of these same orbs.  I call them the Plasma Orbs;38.2592;-119.2114
