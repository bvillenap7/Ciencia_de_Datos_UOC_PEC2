The amazing thing was the color of violet in my night vision. It hovered over me for twenty-five seconds, with no noise,no wings and no wires. It started to back up slowly and then accelerate up. As it was doing this it started to go invisible. this all started and ended in 35 second. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

As the clouds passed, we could determine that the object was below the cloud altitude.  I assumed that it was some kind of weather balloon or man-made object just floating up there, but it never moved from the position that we originally spotted it. The next morning we saw the exact same thing happen.  Our vantage point was from the Mono Village campground, looking directly down the lake at about 15-20 degrees above the horizon.  Since we were on vacation, we did not stare at it until it disappeared, but we could not see it after about 10:00 in the morning. We looked at it several times for a couple of hours each day and using a tree limb as a vantage point---it never changed position on either day.  We attempted to take photographs, but they did not show up---Too far away??;38.2592;-119.2114
