Got out of the truck and watched the very brilliant light hover over us at approx. 1000 ft. for 2-3 min. It did not appear to move, their was no sound, bright light spherical, could not discern outline of any aircraft. The light then began to travel at rapid speed to the west(no sound), gaining elevation as it went. Watched for several minutes as it gradually faded from view over high mountain peaks approx. 50 km. to the southwest. A haze developed around the light as it travelled away from us.;38.2592;-119.2114
