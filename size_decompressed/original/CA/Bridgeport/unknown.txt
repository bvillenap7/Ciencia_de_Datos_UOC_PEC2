A buzzing flying spike crashed in front of use.;2010-08-12 13:00:00;Two seconds;A buzzing flying spike crashed in front of use. Aug 12, 2010.  Bridgeport reservoir. My sister and I were fishing the Bridgeport reservoir from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm we were anchored in the Buckeye channel both facing north, and at about 1:00 pm we herd an extremely loud buzzing sound that was making a shallow dive.  It dove 10Ft in front of me.  The object was a blur, and the speculating speed of the object is 125 to 150 mph.  By viewing the splash of 6 inches width x 11 inches length zipper shape.  I discovered that object has approximately two counter rotating props when it drove it self into the water.  The props are approximately 5 inch in diameter on a approximately 1 inch diameter x 12 inches fuselage.  I thought that this is the creature called the Flying Spikes, but this is not a creature but a mechanical projectile supposedly from the military.   When we arrived to port at 6:00 pm we saw a GMC suburban with four tuff looking men inside just waiting, and when I came up to the suburban the driver said how is it going?  As I past the suburban I over herd one of the men inside say, he’s with his sister.  How do they know I’m with my sister?   When we got back to our campsite, we herd and saw two gray C130 planes flying over use, extremely low through the cannon towards Bridgeport. Putting 2 & 2 together, I think we have a top secret recover taking place.  The crash site Position Coordinates is as followed:  38* 16’ 41n 119* 14’ 48w;38.2592;-119.2114
