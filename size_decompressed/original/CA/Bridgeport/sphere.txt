Observed a white circular 3-D sphere floating silently along at what I thought to be about 35,-40'k (higher?).  ((anonymous report));2018-06-20 19:30:00;5 seconds;observed a white circular 3 demensional sphere floating silently along at what I thought to be about 35,000-40,000ft (possibly higher) I was camping along Highway 108 on top of Sonora pass (@ 9,350 ft. elevation in the Sierra Nevada's) near Bridgeport, California, in the national forest 6/20/18.  I just so happened to look up to the sky and observed a white circular 3 dimensional sphere floating along at what I thought to be about 35,000-40,000ft (possibly higher) in altitude at roughly the same speed as a airliner, and along the same flight path as previous air traffic earlier that day.  It was heading northeast.  I was obstructed by the forest trees so could only observe for about 5 seconds.  It was completely silent, and I was really taken back by that, it actually kind of scarred me.  The sphere dimensions took up about as much space as a 747.  About 90 seconds later a regular airplane continued along that same flight path as noisy as they always are.  1st time seeing a UFO.
