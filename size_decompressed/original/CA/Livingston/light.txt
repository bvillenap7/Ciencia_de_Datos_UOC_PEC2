Three family members and three neighbors, none of us acquainted with each other, saw the “moving stars” traveling from NW to E behind unusual cloud cover.  At least a hundred that would alternate between brightening and dimming.  Some moved past each other faster than others, some in formation and some not.   Lasted for almost two hours.  About an hour into the event a high altitude airplane flew very quickly under the moon on the opposite side of the sky, so we know these lights where not airplanes.  None of the lights made a sound, but the Earth had a strange vibration.  None of the sounds were from a train, a/c unit, or from highway traffic there is a difference between these vibrations.  Even some of the backyard dogs started barking and howling without any seeming provocation.;37.3742;-120.7225
