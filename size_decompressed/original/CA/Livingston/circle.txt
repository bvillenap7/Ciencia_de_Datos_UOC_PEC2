Me and my family were leaving to church at 9pm. My father was the first out the door, and as he walked out he sudenly stoped. I was right behind him and I saw an object in the sky that I could compare in size to what a full moon looks like. The circular object was hubering above us moving slowly. The circular object was emiting a bright white glow that iluminated the floor. The light would turn off and then turn back on in a different spot. It did this twice before it left at a very high speed and left a trail which I belive was just the bright light it was emiting. When the object was right above us it felt like vibrations similar to what u feel when u stand in front of a woofer with base, the only diference was that this light had no sound. When I arrived to church, other people from close by towns saw a similar object. To this day I am still not sure of what it was. When I tell this to my friends most of them laugh or think I made it up, but it was one of those things that I just couldn't explain! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
