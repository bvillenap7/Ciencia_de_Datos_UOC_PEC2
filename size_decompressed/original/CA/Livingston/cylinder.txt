Cylindrical objects in morning sky. ((anonymous report));2019-07-13 09:00:00;10 minutes;Cylindrical objects in morning sky I was driving in Livingston when I saw two cylinder shaped objects in the sky.  I first noticed them when the sun was reflecting off them.  They were both shiny.  At first I thought it was a plane with a glider plane following.   The second object was trailing behind the first object.  Suddenly the object that was following the first, glided under the first object.  I followed them to try to get a photo but they disappeared when I reached a clear area.;37.3742;-120.7225
