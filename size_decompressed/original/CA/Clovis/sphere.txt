A bright gold light that zoomed toward me when I acknowledged it.;2010-02-01 06:00:00;3 min;A bright gold light that zoomed toward me when I acknowledged it. I have seen a UFO and I am so grateful. I believed in them all my life without proof or much mental debate. I just figured we aren't all that exists and if intervention ever happened, the entities sent would be from a material plane like ours so they'd need vehicles. Then one morning around 6 am, I was heading outside to walk my dog. I sat on the bench near the front door to put on my shoes. I heard calm, deep male voice say, “Look to the South.&quot I wasn't afraid or even questioned the existence of the voice outside myself but said dismissively, &quotI don't even know which way South is.&quot  The voice said just as calm and repeated, &quotLook to the South.&quot I said &quotOK&quot and finished putting on my shoes and went outside. I went to the end of my driveway, looked up (which was actually North West but South might have meant up). There was a bright orange star. Brighter than I had ever seen. I thought, &quotThere isn't a morning star in that direction. Wait is that a star?&quot and in that second it rushed down toward me and got as big as the sky. Its surface was moving like the sun. I was gold, orange and warm yellow swirling with “energy”. Then the instant I smiled at it in wondrous awe, it shot straight up and out of sight into the outer atmospheres and was gone. It left more North West than its current position so I saw it zip away. Believe it or not, I had no initial response to the event. I turned south and went on my walk. I said out loud, &quotGee thanks. “and then said,”  You said HI to me&quot. But as I walked I kept looking back to that spot in the sky and smiling to myself.  As I walked along I replayed the three minutes over in my head and that is finally when ego began having a conversation with me about it. I wanted to question its purpose, origin, and meaning.  But then realized it was just an acknowledgement of some kind and had no more meaning than those I placed upon it.  I just accepted it as a personal experience. The next two years were the most trying of my life a complete destruction of all my ego attachments and ego identifiers.  But whenever I felt very alone, confused, overwhelmed and frightened about the drastic changes occurring around me, I always remembered that I had a nod from whatever is &quotmore&quot and could gently release my attachment to the outcome of so much change.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Two glowing spheres observed hovering then moving in the night sky Halloween night.;2011-10-31 19:15:00;60 seconds;Two glowing spheres observed hovering then moving in the night sky Halloween night. On October 31st, 2011 at approx. 1915 hrs (7:15pm PST), I was walking my kids around an affluent neighborhood in NW Clovis when an adult in a separate group pointed up toward the southern star filled sky and stated loudly, Look, there they are again.   I looked up and observed two (2) glowing objects.  One was blue the other orange.  They were at least five (5) times larger than the visible stars. At first they hovered then slowly separated.  The blue one remained stationary while the orange one moved further south.  As it slowed, the blue one also began to move south then both changed direction and faded into the night.  I wasn’t sure if the disappearance was due to the light source going out or they sped away so fast that they appeared to fade?   I am unaware if there were any documentations of the event.  My cell phone camera would not have been able to capture anything due to the lighting conditions and the other group mixed in with the rest of the family groups.  I was unable to reestablish contact with this individual.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Bright orb over Clovis emitting Second Orb.;2014-10-09 19:08:00;155 seconds;Bright Orb over Clovis emitting Second Orb On an early Thursday evening of October 09, 2014, approximately 7:08pm.  I was sitting on my porch, when I witnessed a bright orb directly over me, moving slowly on a north/northeast trajectory.  I had my Canon VIXIA HF R50 camcorder with me and started to record the object.  I recorded the object until it blinked out.  After recording the object, I went inside to upload the video on my computer.  When I started to watch the video in 1080p HD, you can see another smaller orb power up and leave the first larger orb.  Clearer this shocked me because, I don't know of any craft that can do something like that.  I am an amateur when it comes to recording so excuse the shakiness.  The video is on Youtube under Bright Orb over Clovis!;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
