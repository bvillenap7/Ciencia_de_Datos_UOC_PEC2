Very large V shaped object with  seven lights on the leading edges heading southeast from the northwest. No noise, the lights were the same color as the stars (dim white) and the only reason they caught my attention was that they moved slowly together as one. My husband and I watched and as we continued to watch another object that seemed to be towed by the V shaped thing made us both ask each other if we were seeing the same thing. It was a roundish, orange, dimpled disk that seemed to be dragged behind the darker v shaped thing with the lighted edges. The disk rolled and undulated from side to side, like a kite, as it was pulled along.It was the strangest thing either of us had ever seen. We live very near an Air National Guard base and they fly mostly during the day. But it was odd that just before we sighted this object, 2 or 3 Fighters had taken off, headed to the northwest. Were they aware that something was out there? We telephoned the FAT tower, the Air National Guard officer on duty, and a local TV station. No one else had seen or heard anything (even on radar), so they said. It was very strange, but I would like to see this thing again.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
