UFO MAKES HIGH SPEED TURNS;2005-04-01 01:00:00;15 second;UFO MAKES HIGH SPEED TURNS I was sitting on the steps outside my apt. door having a cigarette. I often looked at the stars looking for constellations with my star chart. As I looked around something grabbed my attention from the corner of my eye. I turned my head to see what I thought at first was a shooting star, but as I watching it the object slowed down. It made a 130º left turn traveled straight for about 2 seconds then made a 90º turn, again traveled straight for about 3 seconds. After that it made a series of 4 more high angle (greater than 120º) within 5 seconds and then headed northern but away of the earth as I could see it get smaller until it was out of range with the naked eye.

UFO over Clovis California in June 2007;2007-06-06 22:30:00;few minutes;UFO over Clovis California in June 2007 Around 10 to 11pm my husband stepped out to our back yard to smoke a cigarette. After being out there a short time I heard him yell for me. Annoyed that I had to get up and go out back (I was tired from working all day) to see what he wanted I was stunned when I approached him and he was pointing at a brite white object in the sky. He explained to me he had spotted the object and was watching it and noticed there were no flashing lights like a plane or helicoptor have on the outside, and the object seemed to be perfectly round in shape and all white (like a perfectly round ball of light). It was flying at a really high altitude, but still very visable.  My husband does not believe in aliens and he thinks UFO's are probally just new top secret aircraft by the government.  However when 2 fighter jets scrambled and began after the object he called me out to see.  I observed the white object in the clear night sky and I watched it streak across the sky in a straight path.  After the jets took off  (we live close to the airport) it went off it's then straight path and began to rapidly zig zag from one point to another.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing, no known aircraft I know about could be moving like that. We watched the objects and the jets as long as we could, till the trees got in our way, and we then ran to the front of the house and stood in the middle of the road. By the time we got to the front we could still see the 2 fighter jets but the object they were pursuing was now gone. Background on us: I am a medical assistant for well known doctor in Fresno. I have no criminal history and do not use drugs legal or nonlegal and do not drink.  I do believe in aliens and UFO's.  My husband owns his own buisness and also does not do drugs legal or nonlegal however he occasionally drinks beer.  He does not believe in aliens and thinks UFO's exist however they are just unknown top secret aircraft.  We are both christians and have kids.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523

Circular light over Fresno county, seen in Clovis.;2010-07-29 01:00:00;10 seconds;Circular light over Fresno county, seen in Clovis. I was lying in my backyard with my girlfriend and we were looking at the stars.  She was turned looking at me and talking to me while I was looking up at the stars, and I see this circular object, made of all light, fly across the sky.  It flew by pretty fast it took about ten seconds to get out of my sight.  It was bigger than the stars from the distance away it looked like the size of a ball.  We BOTH heard a sound come from it, but my girlfriend didn’t see it (since she wasn’t looking at the sky).;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
