We were driving down High 99 according to our car compass we were traveling S.E. at exactly 10:10 pm California time both my sister and I saw a HUGE almost flourescent green colored craft in the air. It was almost like 2 circular shapes on the outside and a blackness in the middle. It hovered for a a good 5 to 10 seconds and then disappeared. We thought it may have hidden behind clouds but there was not a single cloud around. Clear skies and nothing but stars to be seen. As quick as it appeared, it disappeared. At first we both didn't say anything to each other almost like we didn't believe what we just saw, then finally I said...Did you see that Sis?! and she told me exactly what I had just seen. Awesome what ever it was.....;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Very dim round light moving fast;2007-12-26 19:30:00;10 seconds;Very dim round light moving fast Date: 20071226 Time: 1930 Conditions: Clear sky, no moon. I was in my house and went to the side yard to have a smoke. I was looking into the southern sky just looking at the stars and passing satellites when out the left side I saw an almost see thru, very dim, brown, round light. It was flying south west and 45 degrees in the sky when I first noticed it. I am not sure of the altitude since it was night but I would have to say it was at least 500 feet and lasted about 10 seconds until I couldn’t see it anymore. It faded into the horizon. I can’t tell the size of it since I don’t know the true distance but to me it looked like 3/4 the size of the moon. Sometimes birds flying at night can glow from lights in cities and I have seen this before but this didn’t seem like that. It was flying way to fast and it didn’t change direction at all. It was very windy so if it was a bird it would have been tossed around a bit. I have been around and worked on all types of aircraft most of my life so there was no chance of it being one. I can usually explain everything I see at night that other people might find strange but this one has me a little baffled. I just thought I would report it. Maybe someone else saw something. I doubt it though. Most people don’t look to the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Thousands of transparent, faintly illuminated objects flying over Clovis, CA 10/13/08 9:20 pm;2008-10-13 09:20:00;50 minutes;Thousands of transparent, faintly illuminated objects flying over Clovis, CA 10/13/08 9:20 pm My sister was sitting on a curb and looked up.  She spotted unusual white and/or amber lights and got my brothers attention.  They watched as hundreds of lights passed overhead, silent, in different shapes and sizes, some changed direction while others rotated effortlessly. They were transparent but were outlined with what appeared to be similar to rope lighting with uniform spacing.  They were heading from East to West and turned toward the Southwest.  They appeared to be about a mile in altitude.  Some seemed to be about a mile in circumference.  When looking through binoculars, I saw a craft that had wavy edges, another that looked like a backwards P.  We watched as they changed direction.  We live near a park with flood lights.  A police helicopter flew overhead around 10:00 pm, and the stadium lights went out and we could not see any after they went out.  There were birds and bats flying around for comparison reference as well as cobwebs hanging from the stadium light posts.  These lights were not birds or debris. There were also airplanes in the sky.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Dark three curved shaped object at Clovis, CA;2013-05-16 19:10:00;10 seconds;Dark three curved shaped object at Clovis, CA The craft was shaped like three circular objects in a triangular shape.  One side appeared red and switched sides every distance to each sphere.  It traveled unusually fast headed NE to S.  Dark in color.  No sound,  at first I thought of it as balloons but then it continued traveling fast from low to higher in altitude until disappearing to the distance.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
