Went outside to see Oval Shaped Object in Sky, with Red Flashing Light. Making dinner in my kitchen with my girlfriend.  Its a cool spring night, we have all the windows in the house open.  Hear a loud burst of noise.  Sounds a lot like that of a hot air balloon.  This was loud, and right over my house.   Went outside to see a Oval Shaped Object, flying above my house moving South/East.  My neighbor also ran outside to see what the noise was.   It had only a bright red light flashing.  The noise kept toggling on and off, just like that of a burner on a hot air balloon.   I watched it for about 2 minutes before it was out of sight.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
