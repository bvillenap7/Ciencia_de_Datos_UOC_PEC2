My first impression was that they were helicopters.  But what got my attention was that these objects were not moving at all.  Puzzled, I went outside to get a better view.  These objects were motionless, flashing a red color, then yellow, almost like a flare or welding arc.  They then shot straight up into the air at an incredible speed until I could only see one them. At this point, the one that I could see looked like a tiny star.  The object then began to move north across the sky at a very high rate of speed, creating a haze around it as it traveled across the sky until it could not be seen anymore.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
The lights seemed to be pulses of bright white lights,  like nothing I've ever seen.;2012-08-20 20:45:00;10 minutes;The lights seemed to be pulses of bright white lights,  like nothing I've ever seen. I was showing my grandchildren some constellations when we noticed what seemed to be fire works, it looked like sparklers.  As it rose up from the horizon they moved in formation from north to south east.  It was visible for 5 to 10 minutes.  The lights seemed to be pulses of energy. I'm am Viet Nam veteran, I've seen a lot of military craft but nothing like that.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
