Bright light or meteor lights up the sky in rural area outside fresno california;1982-06-02 11:00:00;1 minute;Bright light or meteor lights up the sky in rural area outside fresno california I was listening to a radio broadcast tonight on coast to coast and they said to report ufo sitings and talked about why people never do. I always think about this experience even though its been over 20 years ago and really started to think about it after that police dash cam caught that light in the sky recently... that is exactly what me and a few friends saw out in the country while playing outside. We all were around 16 years old and in pitch darkness or at least hardly any light. It was very late and all of the sudden the whole sky lighted up like daytime and we all could see each other. It was so weird and we talked about it after but we never told anyone as we were kids and just thought it was a big meteorite.... I however have it etched in my mind that it was way way to bright for a meteor. It brought light as if it was daytime. The ground and everything lit up as if it was daytime. It was almost as bright as the sun or so it seemed. We actually could see each other for about 10 to 20 seconds. If you ever heard about this incident, I would really like to know what it was. I am not sure about the date but it was either in 81, 82 or possibly 83. I think it was closer to 82.  I also had another strange thing happen in a dream I had about a UFO one night. I used to live by fresno state college and one night had a dream about a ufo. The next day there was a crop circle in the field that was part of fresno states ag department. It happened right about the time that the movie 'signs' was coming out about the ufo crop circles. They said it was a college prank but I thought it was strange that I would have a dream about it the night before it was seen. The dream was very strange and I could actually see the craft. The next day it was found. They would not let anyone in the field to view the evidence and threatened to prosecute any students that destroyed the crops. They said it was a prank but never caught anyone and never let anyone in the field to view the evidence. Anyway I always thou! ght that was a strange coincidence... the dream and the crop coming after it. remember, I was living at the time about a block away from where the crop circle showed up.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Beam of Light near Strawberry Field;1994-03-15 00:30:00;5 minutes;Beam of Light near Strawberry Field It was around 12:30am and I couldn't get any sleep.  Then I was a flash of light so bright it lite up the shy!  I went to my window and saw a large blue light fly over a strawberry field two 3 blocks away from my house.  It was very odd beacuse it made no sound at all?  It looked like the size of a bus! It seemed to just hang over the fields for 3 minutes until it shots a blue beam of light from underenith it! It did this for a minute then stopped and in a matter of just a second shot into the sky and dissapeared. The next day I went to the field to find all the strawberrys where all dead when the day before they where all freash and full of life! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It's a plane, it's a star, NO it's a UFO!;2000-01-01 05:00:00;1 min;It's a plane, it's a star, NO it's a UFO! It was a clear cold morning.  There was no sunlight yet and only a near by street lamp to illuminate the night.  I was going fishing with my father and brother that morning.  I am a stargazer and love to look at the stars, so that morning I looked up into the sky just to enjoy the moment.  I carefully looked for shooting stars and could see a plane in the distance with its beeping lights fly by.  As I was gazing, one star caught my eye.  It looked exactly like a star, only it moved.  At first it moved passed 1 or 2 stars real slowly.  It made a sharp turn and quickened its pace.  It went straight for about 5 more stars and then it suddenly zipped away and disappeared.  I knew this couldn't be a plane because planes cannot move like that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Please respect my privacy.  The object was bright and changed directions;2000-05-29 21:00:00;15 minutes;Please respect my privacy.  The object was bright and changed directions On Sunday May 29th or 30th.  My mother, my brother, my newphews and nieces and me all watched a light in the sky.  I first assumed autmatically that it was a plane, but right away I knew it wasn't.  It moved slowly across the sky.  Then it changed directions and moved back.  It went north and then east.  It seemed to be harassing the planes that passed by.  Then it looked like it was looking for someone.  I then went in and grabbed my camcorder.  I filmed all over the sky.  But didn't see anything on camera.  Later when I put the tape in the VCR the object showed on film.  I was suprised that I had filmed it.  The object goes slow across the sky.  It changes direction in the film.  It also changes shape.  I do not want any publicity or our privacy violated.  This is why I took so long in reporting this.  This is the first time that I got a good look at something like this. It resembled the light a plane gives when flying. But once you see the film you know it is not a plane.  It seems to have an intelligence.  Like it knew what it was doing.  If you would like to make a copy please write me. I will not surrender original copy because it has family members and pets in it.  The part of the tape with the object is not that long any way.  Please contact me by mail.  At first it was exciting to watch it in the sky. But after a while it got boring.  When writing or calling ask for ((name deleted)).  Please write.  Will not accept collect calls.  I did not mark check by being contacted by investigator.  Again it is due to privacy reasons.  I am willing to share tape with you, but someone else has to record off original copy. I don't know how to make a copy.  Thank you for your time.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Follow up on the lights observed on May 2, 2005 in Clovis, CA;2005-05-02 21:00:00;1 minute;Follow up on the lights observed on May 2, 2005 in Clovis, CA This report is a follow up on the red lights we observed on May 2, 2005 in Clovis, CA. I was looking through your site and there is a picture of what we saw...the red lights were reported in TINLEY PARK, ILLINOIS, OCTOBER 31, 2004. I believe these red lights are EXACTLY what we saw.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Bright white light flased in the sky, followed by 2 red flashing lights move up and down, back and forth.;2005-05-02 21:00:00;about one minute;Bright white light flased in the sky, followed by 2 red flashing lights move up and down, back and forth. A friend of ours called us to go outside and look to the Eastern sky.  He had been sitting out in his yard and saw a very fast white light move from East to South.  By the time we got outside, we only saw 2 flashing red ligths.  They were moving back and forth, up and down, (really all over the sky).  We watch the red lights for about one minute until they were out of sight.  We saw a plane fly toward them, but I don't know if the plane was chasing the red lights.  There is a Air National Guard in the city so it could have been a miltary plane.  I work with computers and my husband and friend are both college professors.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
3 dimly lit objects traveling VERY fast passed directly overhead, with no sound;2005-10-09 22:30:00;7 seconds;3 dimly lit objects traveling VERY fast passed directly overhead, with no sound It was about 10:30 pm. I was on my porch having a cigarette, when I saw 3 dimly lit objects pass directly overhead.  They were quite dim.  I would not have seen them at all, were It not for the fact that I was looking straight up at the stars.  It's hard to tell how high tey were, but I'm certain they were more than 5,000ft in altitude.  These things were moving FAST!  They traversed the entire sky(from horizon to horizon), heading north to south, in probably 6 or 7 seconds, and no sound at all.  They were in a triangle formation, one behind another, and the third slightly to one side.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
On the night of November 27, 2008 (Thanksgiving) from 7:05 to 7:10, my sister & I witnessed a strange red/orange light in Clovis, CA.;2008-11-27 19:05:00;5 min.;On the night of November 27, 2008  (Thanksgiving) from 7:05 to 7:10, my sister & I witnessed a strange red/orange light in Clovis, CA. I was inside a family member’s house when my sister came to get me, saying there was a strange light in the sky.  We went back outside and noticed a strange red/orange light drifting in the sky in an upward motion traveling east to southwest.  The object looked like it was on fire, and my first thought was maybe someone had their fireplace going and it was flaming debris, but the motion of the object was floating upward and there was no wind to carry anything.  That and given the distance of the object to us (at arm's length it was about 1/4 diameter), the object was too large to be debris.  I ruled out a flare as it wasn’t falling.  It almost looked like it was something suspended from a balloon, but it was traveling to fast and it was traveling too fast to be a balloon.  If it was a balloon, then it would have been visible or at least a reflection of the light would have been on the balloon. I rushed to my car to grab my digital camera and my sister took hers out of her purse.  I snapped a picture, but it was too dark so I deleted it.  I then decided to change the settings on my camera in hope of maybe getting better luck.  As soon as I looked back up, the object was gone.  Total time of occurrence was five minutes.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Flashing lights over Clovis dancing in the sky;2009-08-06 00:34:00;90 seconds;Flashing lights over Clovis dancing in the sky I was watching t.v. in my living room and kept hearing a deep thunder like sound. I went into my 14 year old daughters room and asked if she was making that noise. She said no she was hearing it to. The weather report said possible thunderstorms that night but unlikely, so I said well it must be thunder. I was about to go out for a smoke anyways so I asked if she wanted to see if there was any lightening over the foothills. As we approached the door she said mom I see stars and clear sky not clouds. So I thought maybe its a motorcycle or something, but unlikely way out in the country like we are. We barely stepped out when we saw them. There first was 3 flashing white lights that were dancing in the sky moving all over the place. Then suddenly there were 6 of them as if they multiplied in front of our eyes. They were dancing like fire flies in the sky. Then they just stopped dancing and formed a pyramid formation. These things seemed to move so fast  and compared to our tree line they appeared to be pretty high. Then a 7th flashing light shot across the formation like a shooting star arcing in the sky. It came to the end of the formation and it abruptly turned to fall in line at the end. They headed east toward the Sierra Mountains zig zagging every now and again. In a matter of less than 2 minutes they were gone. We still don't know what caused the sounds we heard but were amazed at what we saw. From our house we can see all the way to the foothills and mountains without obstruction and are surrounded by fields. It was around 12:34 am or so in Clovis Ca.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Two self- synchronously blinking red lights in night sky;2012-05-08 20:30:00;ten minutes;Two self- synchronously blinking red lights in night sky Two red lights were sailing in parallel and blinking synchronously.  They blinked three times then paused for a moment then blinked three times again before turning off for another few seconds and then blinking again.  They did this as they moved across the sky before disappearing from sight.  They were silent.  There were no other identifying lights of other colors. I cannot guess their altitude or distance from each other.  They did not move rapidly nor did they move slowly. I’ve never seen this before and thought it might be a military or other experiment in self-synchronous communication or a psychological experiment. After work in the spring and summer I sit in my gravity chair by the pool and watch the sky.  I live near the Fresno Yosemite Airport and I watch the planes and the satellites and clouds and stars.  It is relaxing and enjoyable.  I’ve seen all sorts of craft but never two independent objects behaving like this.

Bright light that weaves from left to right and was a fast mover.;2013-08-04 22:00:00;30 seconds;Bright light that weaves from left to right and was a fast mover. At the approximate time indicated my family and I had just come home from a vacation from in Santa Cruz.  I was in the process of unloading our vehicle when a very bright light caught my attention from the west (West being Fresno area)  I decided that it was nothingbe but a plane and continued unloading the vehicle.  At this point I noticed it was moving way faster than any plane I have ever seen...and that's saying something since there is a NGAFB with NORAD connections in Fresno.  I then decided to stop unloading temporarily to watch it's path and try to confirm to myself it was a plane.   As I continued to watch it my mother had come out to help unload the vehicle.  When I told her I jokingly said  hey mom look a UFO, haha.  It was at that point I realized it was something I had never seen before.  As I looked up again my mother chimed in it's moving in a left to right movement.  I watched and to my amazement it indeed was moving from left t! o right very very fast!  Almost as like a radio wave on a monitor going up and down on a sort of curve.  If you can picture that but of a bright object in the sky that's exactly what it looked like.  To make it even more weird there was absolutely no sound to this object.  It continued in a NE direction until fading from view.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Unusual light glowing brighter and then fading and becoming larger while fading away.;2014-09-12 05:50:00;7 seconds;Unusual light glowing brighter and then fading and becoming larger while fading away. I saw a moving bright light similar to a fan-tail.  It grew brighter and then seemed to dim and grow much bigger at the same time until it faded to nothing.  I am a sober, early morning dog-walker.  I walk the dogs every day and have never seen this before.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
I saw a blue shimmering light in the sky that made a vertical descent.;2015-09-26 21:30:00;5 min;I saw a blue shimmering light in the sky that made a vertical descent. I was outside in th backyard with my mom, dad, and little brother.  My brother noticed it first and yelled for me to look up in the sky.  I saw a bright BLUE light in the sky, it seemed to be shimmering and had this strange aura around it.   As I looked at it, it made my vision go blurry, I said Whoa!  And at the same time my brother said, Did you just go cross-eyed too?   The light started to dance around a bit, moving slightly from side to side. And then it started to descend straight down vertically and changed to a purple color.   We lost sight of it at that point because of the trees.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
Fast white light moving through the sky.;2016-05-04 21:30:00;5 seconds;Fast white light moving through the sky. I saw a light in the sky traveling from the north east to the south west.  The light looked to be about the same size as the white light you see on a helicopter.  The light was moving across the sky so fast that it managed to get my attention.  I said to my wife who was facing me, “look at that behind you” and as she turned around the light suddenly made what looked like a 90 degree turn and dart off to the east so fast that my wife was not able to see it.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
White light traveling fast across the sky.;2017-04-11 20:40:00;30 seconds;White light traveling fast across the sky. My wife and I were just happen to be looking up in the sky as we were taking our dog for his final potty break for the night.  While I was looking up, I saw a light of an object traveling at a much faster speed of a typical airplane or any other object that I could identify. The time was 8:40 pm.  It was dark and the sky was clear.  I was facing east and looking at the moonrise just beneath Jupiter.  Out to the southeast, I noticed this object that had a white solid light traveling in a straight path to the northeast direction.  The first thing I noticed was that the light was solid and did not flash or flicker like the traditional airplane lights we see in the sky.  I quickly brought got the attention of my wife and showed her this moving object and compared it to the much slower-moving airplane lights in the sky to contrast the difference between the object I am describing in this text. Once we identified this particular object as being so different, we continued to follow its path. It was a straight path.  At first, and as it was moving overhead, the light seemed to get brighter and larger. My wife described the light to become elongated.  The light quickly dimmed as the object continued to travel into the northern direction.  As it approached the Northern horizon, there seemed to be a flash of light (kind of light a shooting star), then the object disappeared. The total arc of its pathway that we witnessed was approximately 90 degrees arc and this took about 30 seconds.  The light was a constant white light. The speed of this object was much faster than any other planes in the sky. There was no sound with this object. Because it was nighttime, we could not see any vehicle. I could not identify what that object was. I looked up the ISS location and found it to be over South America at the time. As I continued to observe the sky, we saw lots of airplanes, helicopters that night. I even saw what appeared to be a satellite traveling overhead with the usual speeds that I've observed in the past. But nothing was even close to what I just witnessed. My personal background:  I am ((deleted--forties)) years old.  I am in Healthcare working as a ((deleted)) working in ((specialty deleted)) for the past ((deleted--2 decades)) years.  My prior career was in electronics, computers and mechanics.  My wife is a homemaker who used to work in ((deleted--medical field)). I am really interested in knowing what this light/object could have been.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523

Sometimes it will blink dim, and sometimes really really bright like a shooting star.  It would also appear or blink in different spots in a general area, so not in a straight path.
