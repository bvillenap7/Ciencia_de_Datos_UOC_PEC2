I was looking at some stars to he right of me, and out of the corner of my eye I notice moving light. I focused on it and it wasn't one, but three its! Moving from my right to left (directly in front of me, but way off in the distance). I could clearly see three dim red lights flying equidistance apart. They weren't flying directly behind each other, but as if you turned a straight line at maybe a 45 degree angle. After they caught my eye and I quickly realized what I was seeing, I immediately sat up and and said out loud, Oh my ((deleted)) god. Shortly after I said this, they disappered. I don't know if they flew away at an insane speed, or if I just couldn't see them anymore because of a street light that was then blocking my view. I've believed in UFO's for a while but never saw any. Now I have! There is no doubt in my mind that what I saw was proof of E.T.'s! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.
