No noise. A friend of mine left my house at approx. 11:10 pm heading west on Herndon Ave.  It being a clear night, he looked out his windshield to see the stars. There weren't any. It was then that he noticed a large isosceles triangle shape directly above him. The object was about as big as a football field and had completely blocked out his view of the stars.  There were 3 white lights on the underside, one at each corner. The rest of it was dark.  It was flying (or floating) very close to the ground, approx. 100 ft. above him.  He said it seemed close enough to hit with a rock.  He pulled his car off to the right shoulder of the road and turned off the engine and radio.  He leaned out the window and looked up to watch the object.  There was no noise.  He couldn't see how thick the craft was. It hovered silently for a few seconds, slowly rotated to its right, then proceeded to slowly move towards the southwest.  Suddenly, it shot upwards and away at an angle with lightning speed going in the same direction.  He noticed a sulfer-like smell in the air after it left. There were no cars on that section of the  road at the time of his sighting.  He immediately drove back to my house and banged on my bedroom window.  Thinking he had forgotten his keys or had car trouble, I rushed to open the front door.  He looked me right in the eyes and said, I just saw a UFO!  He was visibly very shaken up.  I went out outside into my driveway with him and he explained what he'd seen.  I looked in the direction of his sighting but could see nothing.  A few weeks later, we were watching an episode of Unsolved Mysteries that dealt with the UFOs sighted in Belgium.  They showed a picture of a large triangular craft with 3 lights on the underside, and he told me that was something like what he'd seen, but without the red light in the center.  We decided not to report the sighting until now because he was too shaken up by it at that time. I've known him for quite a long time and I have no reason not to believe him.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523

View looking south of Fresno at an approximate 30 degree angle from horizon.  Maintaining formation, they lowered until I could no longer see them past the trees.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523

Triangle craft with three red lights one on each corner.  It also had smaller white lights that flashed along the side.;2014-08-12 22:15:00;7 minutes;Triangle craft with three red lights one on each corner. It also had smaller white lights that flashed along the side. My husband and I were in our front yard watching the Persieds meteor shower between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday, August 12, 2014.  We had a pair of binoculars with us to see the stars better.  I walked inside the house for a moment when I heard my husband yelling my name in an urgent manner so I ran back outside and he was looking up at the sky in Northwest direction.  I looked up and saw a red light low in the sky, moving slowly from North to South directly over a house about 4 houses down.  As it came into my view, a second light was directly behind it.  The distance between the two lights was about four times the distance of the length of a helicopter.  As I watched, a third red light came on next to the second red light making a shape of a triangle. The first thing I noticed was how huge the object was. I had never seen anything even close to this size it was enormous.  I also noticed there was no sound at all.  The object was extremely low so it was odd that it was completely silent.  As soon as I realized this was no ordinary object, I called for my son who also came running outside and witnessed this as well.  I had the binoculars at the time so I watched the object through the binoculars for the remainder of the sighting. I could see that the three lights were large red spheres on the bottom of the craft and there were much smaller rectangular white lights along the side of the craft that flashed on in a sequence.  As I watched through the binoculars all three red lights stayed on at once for a short time and then one of them turned off but I could still see the sphere, it was dark grey or black.  All of a sudden all of the spheres turned white at the same time for a couple seconds and then two of the lights turned off while only one white light remained.  I could still see the spheres with the binoculars, but when I looked at the object without the binoculars I could only see the white light.  At this point the object appeared to be an ordinary aircraft with my naked eyes.  We continued to watch the object for a few minutes until it was too far to see anymore.;36.8328509174311;-119.67343027523
