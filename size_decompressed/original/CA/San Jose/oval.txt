I was seated on an aircraft landing at San Jose International Airport, I looked out the window and saw a white, oval-shaped aircraft flying above the community at a very very high rate.  It was about the size of a house.  I saw it from above and during the afternoon, so I could not see any lights from the craft.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
possible  UFO  crash debris discovered in southwest New Mexico  (recent);2000-09-21 23:00:00;3 hrs;possible  UFO  crash debris discovered in southwest New Mexico  (recent) This is a piece of debris found in southwest New Mexico 1998,1999. This person ((name deleted)) drove upon a 25' x 15' oval dip in the road with melted metal imbedded in the asphalt and debris scattered on both sides of the road,no vehical fire and no vehical was found.  It's as though something came down scrapped the pavement then left.  I traded a small nickel iron meteorite for a couple pieces,then sent them to Linda Moulton Howe to be sent to a lab for analysis, the results were mainly aluminum with other trace elements. I'm trying to have an isotope ratio analysis to be perfomed.  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Large, high altitude, oval-shaped object sighted over San Jose, CA;2009-08-22 03:45:00;3 minutes;Large, high altitude, oval-shaped object sighted over San Jose, CA I'm a licensed private pilot (22 years) and avid skywatcher (40 years). I was up late and went outside to check the sky. I was looking at Cassiopeia which was near the mid-heaven. Passing close to the star Segin, I noticed 2 lights moving together in a N-NE direction. The lights were roughly 1/4 degree apart. I noticed the lights appeared to be on the opposite outer edges of an dark oval shape. The oval appeared to have numerous additional lights around the periphery. The object was silent. I saw no sign of navigation lights, flashing lights, or strobes. There was no trail behind the object. I was able to watch the object move in a straight line traveling approximately 20 degrees in about 3 minutes until a tree blocked my line of sight.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Two Oval Shaped Craft Flying Low and Extremely Fast in Tandem Formation Over San Jose California!;2010-12-09 16:00:00;7 Seconds;Two Oval Shaped Craft Flying Low and Extremely Fast in Tandem Formation Over San Jose California! I was released from the San Jose hospital on December 9th in the afternoon and it was a very nice sunny day with no clouds in the sky and shortly after arriving to my home I was resting in a chair in my back yard facing to the South at around 4pm when all of the sudden I noticed two oval shaped objects come into my vision from deep in the Western sky.  They were traveling together and within very close proximity of each other just as two side by side blue angel jets do when they fly in tandem formation during air shows. After they had caught my eyes attention, I focused directly on them for approximately 7 seconds as they went from the far right hand side of the Western sky all the way to the left of the Eastern sky.  I tried to get my friend’s attention who was standing to my left and facing me to turn around and look at the two fast flying ufo’s.   As he had turned to face them, they were already two thirds the way across the sky which caused me to get up out of my chair and walk forward passing by my friend to catch the last glimpse of them as they went over the far Eastern hills. The two ufo’s were traveling at approximately 4,000 feet above the ground and were about 3 miles or so out away from my home and seemed to be traveling at a speed of at least 1,000 plus miles per hour as it appeared from the distance that they had covered in such a quick time. The way I figured their speed at about 1,000 plus miles an hour is because I lived near the San Jose airport which is about 2 miles North West of the home that I was living in at the time and I use to watch the incoming and out going planes flying overhead all of the time in the sky at about the same distance that I had watched the two oval shaped ufo’s flying and they don’t cover anywhere near the distance of skyline in such a short period of time that the two ufo’s did in that day of December!   Everything that I have mentioned in this statement is 100% true and as accurate as I can remember.  My eyesight is 20 20 in my right eye and 10 20 in my left eye which is much better than average, so, what I was looking  at was very clear to my eyesight!;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Cigar shaped object, could be blimp, over east foothills of san jose,( calaveras reservoir area) during afternoon commute.;2010-12-16 16:00:00;5 minutes;Cigar shaped object, could be blimp, over east foothills of san jose,( calaveras reservoir area) during afternoon commute. Seen above east foothills during commute going north on 880. Initially thought it to be a traffic copter given its size. It remained in apporox. the same location while I drove, instead of gaining on it it remained just above the hills and size unchanged. 5 minutes elapsed going 70mph on freeway. assumed it must either be the Goodyear blimp or the 1 zeppelin airship that does bay area tours out of moffet field.   Never witness either of those crafts in that area in the past, it's unlikely airspace for either craft. It finally dipped out of sight behind hills before I could pull over and view it with binoculars.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
South San Jose, bright orb flying over mountains near Almaden Valley.;2012-06-17 21:00:00;15 minutes;South San Jose, bright orb flying over mountains near Almaden Valley. I live in South San Jose (Almaden) and first spotted UFOs over the Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve on 16th June at 8.50 pm - my wife saw them too.  I took this video (on my phone) the next night when just one UFO appeared at the same time, and hung around for 15 minutes.  On both occasions, the objects emitted white, green and red slow pulsing light.  They object in this video moves from side to side across the sky and at times soars high above the mountains in the distance.  It's hard to see just how bright the light is from this video, but the objects really shone when at their brightest then fade to almost disappear before glowing again.  I estimate the UFO is about a mile away from where I filmed this, which should be close enough to hear some sound from a conventional aircraft, but there was complete silence.
