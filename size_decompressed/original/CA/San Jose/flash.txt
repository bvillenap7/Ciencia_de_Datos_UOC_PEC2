I was lying down in the back seat passenger side gazing out the window at stars when I saw an explosion of light looking like a kaleidoscope in the sky.  It filled the side window which was probably 18x20.  The light from the blast lasted probably near 20 seconds, with lots of color then slowly faded.  We were traveling south on monterey road in san jose ca. This occured nearly overhead yet somewhat off the west. returning home we called the mercury news and moffet naval air station to report. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date of June 30, 1977.  We would welcome other reports about the incident.  PD));37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
A bright flash illuminated a third of the sky originating from a point like a star.;1989-10-17 22:30:00;5 seconds;A bright flash illuminated a third of the sky originating from a point like a star. All I can remember is that my cousin and I were looking up at the sky at approximately 10:30.We were noting the constellations, when all of a sudden a bright flash illuminated about a third of the sky. The flash originated from a small point , but appeared to grow from it. We became very terrified and ran home. I will always remember it because it happened the same evening as the 7.1 Loma Preita earthqauke.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Very low, very long, metor-like flash across sky;2002-03-17 22:00:00;10 seconds;Very low, very long, metor-like flash across sky I was driving alone on 101 N at approximately 10:00 PM (had left Castroville shortly after 9:00 PM). Having just crossed San Jose city limits to the South (the area that is still undeveloped, just hills and fields along the 101), I saw a flash in the sky that caught my attention, proceeding from the West (to the left of the highway) to the east (to the right of the highway) ahead of me. It was like a shooting star, but much longer and lower than other meteros I have seen, which generally flash for a second high in the sky and then are gone. This one seemed low, like a plane approaching landing, and lasted maybe 10 seconds total, leaving a luminous trail as it went (again, like a shooting star, but lasting much longer). It was gone without any sound, or explosion. I found myself cringing as it passed, it had seemed so low I thought it might hit the hills near the freeway.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
A small blinking object in the sky flying at unusually high speed.  After 10-15 seconds, it disappeared.;2018-01-03 19:05:00;15 seconds;A small blinking object in the sky flying at unusually high speed.  After 10-15 seconds, it disappeared. I was sitting on the right back side of a car.  The sightseeing happened approximately at 7 - 7:05 PM, somewhere on Camden Ave and S Bascom Ave./Union Ave in San Jose, CA 95124.  A small blinking object was seen in the sky, flying at unusually high speed.  I first thought it was an aircraft, but again, but I never saw an airplane flying that fast.  I don't know how to describe the speed, but it flew faster in the sky than the driving car.   After 10-15 seconds, it disappeared.  I still cannot give a direct answer what that really was.  Maybe it really was a UFO, or just an aircraft flying at very high speed and then hiding through the clouds.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
