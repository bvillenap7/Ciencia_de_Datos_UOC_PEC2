It was red and shaped like an upside down U.  The red was very bright and it looked as if there were red dots (or lights) under each of the sides a bit less luminous.  The object moved from a stationary position (hovering) to a straight down and out of my sight then returned to the same hovering position location.  I first saw it at after several seconds.   The object then made a fast move directly west (to my left) and the hovered..dropped down out of sight, then back up and a fast move back to the east to the original place I first saw it.   I attempted to call my son at that time to get him to acknowledge I was not crazy but he did not answer.  So I went back outside and it was still in the same place.  I continued to watch it hover for at least 5 more minutes then it disappeared and I saw a huge circular object (that was at least 10 times the size of the original red object) glide up and out of the sky...the thing was dark but more like a shadow or almost invisible or like you could see through it and observe it at the same time.  I am still in shock!;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
