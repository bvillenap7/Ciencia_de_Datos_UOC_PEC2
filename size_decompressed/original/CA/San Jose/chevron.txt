One star shaped object, another V shaped object blending in with the nighttime clouds;2005-10-01 20:05:00;10mins;One star shaped object, another V shaped object blending in with the nighttime clouds I was sitting outside watching the nighttime clouds moving from the hills, and I observed a bright star-like object that would move behind the clouds, stop, and continue moving. This object was too high to have been an airplane, and was flying at a much higher altitude than planes do. I then called my sister to come and see this object. She could not find the object I was talking about. As we were talking about the object, a V shaped hang-glider looking object was slowly moving in the opposite direction of the bright star-like object but at a much lower altitude, and was almost blended in to the colour of the clouds. It moved back and forth, then continued to travel Southwest. My sister and I both determined that this V shaped object was not a bird, because it was much too large, flying higher than birds do, and was gliding the entire time we saw it. We also knew it was not an airplane, because there was no sound at all, and absolutely no lights. After the V shaped object had vanished into the clouds, the bright star-like object was mysteriously gone, and a helicopter flew by quickly, going in the same direction as the V shaped object.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Bright orange-red light seen over San Jose, CA.;2009-08-10 00:08:00;12 mins;Bright orange-red light seen over San Jose, CA. A bright orange-red object was seen from a bedroom window.  We went outside to get a closer look.  It was really high up in the sky, and was really bright.  It seemed to be over downtown San Jose and moved toward the Cambrian area of San Jose.  It moved slowly at first and then before it disappeared moved quite rapidly.   At first it moved quite slowly, drifting to the right and then arcing over to the left.  Then it took a straight line to the left and quickly rising and eventually disappearing.  The light was solid and then quickly flickered before it disappeared.  The object looked like it might have been in the shape of a boomerang, but was really high in the sky to confirm.

Chevron and small sphere craft going south over 95128 area. Amazing to see.;2015-09-09 21:30:00;10 seconds;Chevron and small sphere craft going south over 95128 area. Amazing to see. We looked up and saw a chevron shaped craft headed South towards the Santa Cruz Mt. range.  It moved quite quickly.  It had seven oval shaped dim lights on it that we could both see clearly.  It was dark in color and after about 5 seconds it slowly dimmed its lights and vanished. Then, about 5 seconds later, there was an extremely BRIGHT, small  round craft that flashed and then shot off towards the same direction as the first draft and vanished. It was amazing.  Amazing.
