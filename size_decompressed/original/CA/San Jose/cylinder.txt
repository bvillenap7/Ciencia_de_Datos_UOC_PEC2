Glowing Amber Floating barrel size object.;2016-06-01 11:30:00;10 minutes;Glowing Amber Floating barrel size object. I saw an object about the size of a 55 gallon drum, glowing amber, without bright lights, floating over the top of the houses in my neighborhood, while I was walking my dog.   I observed that it flowed over the top of the houses, then floating between two street lights, then up past some trees at the end of the street and then it faded from vision as it moved out into space.   I drew pictures of it when I got home.  It was glowing amber it was not bright light and seem to be glowing from the inside.  It was the shape of a cylinder or a 55 gallon drum.  The barrel type of object floated quietly.   I asked someone who I saw on the street about 5 minutes later if they had seen it and they said no.   I'd really like to know what it was.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Capsule/Cylinder shaped object.;2021-06-21 14:45:00;10 Seconds;Capsule/Cylinder shaped object. I was talking outside with someone and noticed a object with a shadow underneath moving east before turning quickly northeast. It originated from the west and I only noticed it when it came from behind a tall building. It almost moved like a submarine moving through water. It seemed like a capsule or a plane without wings or a rutter. I noticed no sound. Other people were congregating outside at the time but most had there backs turned. I was the only one to actually notice. I told my friend but he was not too serious about it. No clouds were in the area at the time although the area is known for heavy air traffic.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
