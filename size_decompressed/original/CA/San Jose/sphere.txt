As I looked up at the gulls,I noticed above them at about 4-5 white spheres traveling east to west at about 30 to 40 thousand feet. At approximately 1:30pm on 3/13/98, I was in my backyard when I looked up and noticed a group of seagulls flying over head. Directly above traveling in a east to west direction over San Jose and heading twards the coast I noticed four to five bright spheres. I focused on the birds again to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me, then back on the spheres. These objects were white and completely round in shape. No other characteristics were observed.It was hard to tell how fast they were moving. They were traveling in a box formation. One trailing object moved from left to right over another and then moved back to its original position. It was at this time I decided to go in the house a get my binoculars, when I returned they were gone. For the next couple of days I told myself that what I saw could not have been a UFO, but there were no wings, perfectly round and very bright in color. I have not told my family because they would think I was nuts. I had to make this report because I think its important. I know what I saw and they were not planes nor were they baloons. If you are able to find out what these were, I would appreciate it if you would let me know. Thanks, salarussas@msn.com;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
A bright, shiny, metallic-object, seen from commercial passenger aircraft.;2000-04-24 18:08:00;2 seconds;A bright, shiny, metallic-object, seen from commercial passenger aircraft. I and another witness (seated behind me) were travelling northbound on Southwest Airlines flight #770 from Burbank, Calif. to Oakland International (Calif.) Upon descent, near San Jose, California, at an approximate altitude of 5-8,000ft., we witnessed a bright, metallic spherical object travelling south in the opposite direction of our airliner, approx. 7 o'clock low seen from the port side of our aircraft. Speed is hard to guess, we saw it for only about 2 seconds, just enough for our brains to realize there WERE NO WINGS. I would guess our airliner to be travelling at 2-300 mph, the sphere probably 3-400mph in the opposite direction. I wished I had stayed to ask the pilot if he had seen it, I was almost afraid to. Now I see why these things are never reported to the media, who would listen? (and I AM the media!);37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

Light spotted early evening moving  rapidly for 30 sec then becoming stationary appearing as white bell-jar shape.;2004-05-17 18:45:00;Approx. 2 min;Light spotted early evening moving  rapidly for 30 sec then becoming stationary appearing as white bell-jar shape. At about 6:45PM PST on 5/17/04 I observed a moving light flying from the east foothills of San Jose, CA toward the southwest.  The light, first estimated to be about 2500ft altitude and 3 mile distance, drew my attention because it appeared to have the intensity and quality of a bright aircraft landing light as observed in the night time.  The initial velocity was considerably faster than aircraft often observed flying at that altitude and range.  The object flew at relatively constant velocity and altitude for the first 30 sec. and then came to a gradual stand-still during the next 15 seconds with the light dimming and finally appearing as a white circular diffuse object with relatively sharp edges.  I retrieved my binoculars (7X35 power)within 30 seconds and viewed the object which appeared more like a bell jar shape (1:1 aspect ratio)with an occasional sliver of black at the bottom observed.  The object seemed to move slightly up and down and sideways hovering just below one of the white cumulus clouds (elevation 3205 ft per local meteorological report).  I continued to view the object through binoculars for an additional minute until it disappeared upward into the cloud.  The object never reappeared during an additional 15 minutes of observation.  No sound was heard from the object. Initial AZ and EL angles were later estimated using a protractor jig.  Using these angles plus the flight time and cloud height, a set of latitude and longitude angles were derived using MS Street Finder application.  The calculated date is given below.  Observer location:  LAT.=37.38720 deg. N   LONG.= 121.84012 deg. W Initial object location: LAT.=37.41150 deg. N   LONG.=121.78898 deg. W Final object location:  LAT.=37.37613 deg. N   LONG.=121.80665 deg. W  Elevation:  3200 ft Avg. velocity: 234 miles/hr Final slant range:  2.1 miles Est. object size: 15 ft +/- 4ft diameter based on est. angular size and slant range.

Round black object with rainbow-halo seen in San Jose sky after May 17, 2004;2004-05-31 17:00:00;1 minute;Round black object with rainbow-halo seen in San Jose sky after May 17, 2004 On May 17,2004, I was assaulted by a White man who had an Asian Indian companion on Avenida del Roble, a block away from my house on Entrada Cedros while my brother was in the Philippines. A week or so later, I seem to remember reports of thunderstorms in San Francisco, I tried to have my citizenship changed at the Philippine Consulate general.  There were two Caucasian Filipinas at the Consulate who said something about the Embassy of France, and one of them said, “Thank you” to the people at the customer service window. A few days later, I was walking on Velasco Drive, also a block away from my street, when I saw a round black object appear in the western sky.    It was surrounded by a rainbow-colored halo, and it moved slowly through the grey sky until it set behind the Santa Teresa foothills. I saw the Filipinas again in a dream I had in February 2009. I have tried to get out of the assault situation by reporting a dream about my boyfriend Quetzalcoatl from Rolling Thunder, the Cherokee shaman, on May 14, 2009, after which I woke up crying and made some hot chocolate, along with other information, to the Records Office of UC San Francisco Medical Center where my mother drove me on the day I was assaulted . In the first week of June, there were thunderstorms that I did not want throughout the state of California.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Sphere emits Rainbow of Colors;2005-02-04 09:45:00;2 Minutes;Sphere emits Rainbow of Colors I was leaving work to go deliver some parts, and as I was closing the door I heard a roar of an airplane, The Company I work for s located near San Jose Minneta International Airport. I looked up to take a look at the plane as I always do, and right above the flight path of the plane I noticed a sphere shaped object glistening in the sunlight. It was probably at 2,000 - 3,000 feet hovering motionless. I stood there staring at if for approximately 1 minute and then it began emitting a rainbow of colors, very intense and bright and it definitely had a pattern to it. I waved my arms, convinced that whatever was occupying this unknown object had intelligent life forms aboard it. It then began to move westward and then took off at amazing speed. Nothing significant, but it was something unusual.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

My surveillance camera took pictures of a spook on, 3/13/07!   At 6:19:19 AM a floating softball sized glowing white and green orb with a wispy aura set off my front door camera.  It slowly moved out of the field of view at the top by 6:19:52.  At 6:20:36 it came back down and went back out the bottom at 6:20:42.  It repeated again, the same way, at 6:21:28 and disappearing at 6:23:54.  At 6:28:00 it reappeared at the lower left hand corner of the camera image then disappears only to reappear at 6:29:29 in the same spot, then disappear.  When I told our neighbor about it she had to come and see it.  Neither of us could explain it!  I thought it might be a reflection of the sun coming up, but sunrise was not until an hour later and a reflection of the sun or moon would not reverse itself, repeat, or be three dimensional!  Does anyone know who I should report this to before my DVR writes over it in a few days?  To add more mystery to this, the anniversary of my mother-in-law's death was the previous day and my wife dreamt about her mother that night.

I was on the fourth floor of Valley Fair mall in the early morning and was watching the usual government chemtrail's killing us on a daily basis, that's when I noticed a small orb or sphere that could maybe fit a single person in it. It was about 200 to 300 yards away I have more than perfect 20/20 vision I can see perfect far and close. I noticed the chemtrail coming out of the back of the plane when the orb appeared and did three full circles around the chemtrail itself and then flew to the very end of the chemtrail and back to the very front of the chemtrail right behind the plane. After that it quickly broke away from the chemtrail and flew towards Valley Fair mall about maybe 50 to 100 yards closer. It then did a sudden sharp turn and seemed to slowly and leisurely fly toward the Mount Hamilton area and disappeared. The orb was silver and smooth I could not see any widows, lights, markings, or contrails coming from it.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

I'm a network admin/wireless technician for a small company in the bay area. We have access points up on monument peak in Milpitas CA. In the San Francisco Bay Area.  I was up on one of our towers on monument peak, swapping out an access point, when the other technician with me. Looked out to the left where our office was in San Jose.  And yelled at me to look.  When I looked out, I saw a gray, sphere object omitting light from it.   I watched it for several seconds.  Just wondering what it was.  And then I could see the omitting light, began to intensify.  till it got to a point where it was close to being as bright as the sun.  Which was over to my right, high up in the sky.  Far away from this object.  One the object got to this point it sustained that level of brightness, and appeared to come towards the Hill we where on.  But then Stopped, omitting such a bright light and resumed its greyish/soft omitting light. Right after that, I kinda sweep the whole bay, from where I was, and now saw 3 identical small objects show up in sequence, and at parallel height. (could draw a straight line through all 4)   At that point, I was panicking, and wanted to get off the 25ft tower I was on, and rush to my truck, just down the hill to grab my camera. (Truck was about 500 ft away from the antenas) So I did and returned with my camera. The first main object was gone, and the other 3 behind it where leaving in sequence as well. I was able to snap off pictures of the 4th orb/sphere/object, which was closer to San Francisco, out over the south Bay. I've been up there 30-40 times this year, I have never seen any lights up there that could compare, ive never seen any reflections that could compare or have ever been 1/10th as bright as these in clear sunny day light conditions. I just cant explain what these where.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
white/red orb  (photos taken);2011-05-01 16:59:00;12 min;white/red orb  (photos taken) Witnessed object from front door window.  Going approx. east to west, started 80 deg from horizon.  I saw object as a bright star at first, it then changed to a red star, then to a black sphere in the span of about 15 seconds.  I have witnessed this object multiple times in the past, so i was prepared and grabbed my camera from my desk.  Just seconds later i was outside my front door with the camera, at this point it was almost directly above me.  Again it appered as a white star but changed red, then a few more times from white to red, but not always a complete change sometimes only half way. I do take pictures as it slowly floats over my house.  I go to my backyard to get a better view and it now apperars much higher/smaller and is now just a white dot in the sky, and it is now almost stationary. I observe it for another 10 min, then it slowly faded away, i tried to take more pics but was largely unsuccessful.  It is very difficult to see with the naked eye! so its twice as hard to get on my cameras view finder (cannon 10x optical zoom digital camera).   I do my best and snap pictures anyways most of the time i see this thing, most dont come out and the ones that do usually just show a white or red dot in the sky.   Needless to say disappointing, however this time two of the pictures came out with some good detail if zoomed in.  When i witnessed the object i didnt see the detail that shows in the picture.  I think its because the pictures were shot when the object was changing colors, and in real time it happens almost instantly and the change is self is not really visible.  p.s. I just found out as i was typing this report that Usama bin laden is dead at the hand of US forces. An interesting day for sure;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

2 orange lights moving in the sky non typically in San Jose CA;2012-08-10 21:50:00;5-10 min;2 orange lights moving in the sky non typically in San Jose CA 9:50 PM Aug 10th, Friday night in San Jose CA, intersection of Camden Ave and Crystal Springs, my daughter and her friend (They are 13) and I (I am 43) were taking a walk around the block like I’ve done many times before.  The sky was very clear, as we walked up Crystal Springs away from Camden Ave about ½ way up the street I looked up to the left ( about 60-70% up in height in the sky) and there were 2 orange, what looked like bright stars, amongst the stars. These stood out because they were about 2-3X the size of others and were bright orange amongst all the other white stars. I pointed them out to the two girls with me and we watched them for about 5-10 min. At first they were stationary, then one started to move down and at an angle.  After moving a distance, in terms of the size of the light, about 20-30 times it size down,  it turned at a sharp right angle and traveled about 10-20 times it’s size to the right and stopped. Then it started up toward the ! other to a point that I thought it was going to go right into the other, then about 2-3 times it size away from the other, it stopped. From there in descended again, this time its light starting to flicker  and reduce in its brilliance, several times it almost went out but then lit up again, all the while it was descending, then it faded one last time and was gone. The other remained there and then it too descended and flickered and then at last it was gone entirely.  All 3 of us were watching the whole time and the kids were asking me what I thought it was, all I could say was that it was not an airplane, not a satellite, not a star, I’d never seen anything that color in the sky move in those directions and then disappear, so I said it must be a UFO. When we retuned to the house, I sat in my back yard hoping to see something else looking up in the sky. While I did not see any more orange lights moving about, at 10:10PM my entire peripheral vision saw what looked like a meteorite streak across the sky with its tail in full view the entire time even after passing for a moment, it was lower than any shooting star I’ve ever seen, I would have thought it was the height of a high flying airplane. In the morning I looked hoping to see something in the local news paper but here was nothing so I Googled “strange lights in the sky” and saw clip after clip about just such orange lights. Then I Googled “Strange lights in the sky last night” and did see a post about someone in another state and possibly another county on the same Friday night, same time frame, seeing the same thing. Looking up now more often than even before….;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
White, semi translucent orb moving in erratic directions, hovering and then leaving at immense speed.;2014-05-13 16:00:00;1 minute;White, semi translucent orb moving in erratic directions, hovering and then leaving at immense speed. On 5/13/14 at approximately 1600 hours I observed an object in San Jose, Ca, near highway 237.  The object was a sphere or orb, white and semi translucent. The object appeared no bigger than a soccer ball.  The shape was very clean, not distorted, a perfect orb or spherical shape. I first assumed the object to be a plastic bag or seagull but the object stopped in midair in what appeared to be 15 – 25 mph winds heading South by South East.  The object was at an altitude higher than a six story building but lower than the aircraft taking off at the nearby San Jose Airport.  Several commercial aircraft, 2 or 3 mostly 737s were visible during this time. The object moved in an erratic behavior dropping 50 – 60 ft and then climbing vertical another 50 – 60 ft.  The object moved right to left in a 50 yard area and then suddenly headed south and vertical in an upward motion at a speed much faster than the surrounding aircraft, birds, or insects that I observed.  Another way to characterize the speed, I have worked closely with F-18 Hornets and have never seen them capable of travelling at this speed. I doubted my observation several times thinking it could be a plastic bag, a bird, a drone, an insect, or even a piece of flying pollen.  None of the above items match the flight characteristics that this odd craft showed as it seemed intelligently controlled, capable of stopping and moving about in any direction, at any speed despite the winds. There were no visible clouds, no light shining on the windows of the building that I observed the object through.  I have never seen anything like it. There was no visible propulsion system, jet intake, propellers, or anything that would indicate the power source this craft used to move about.  If I had not been staring where I was at that exact moment I never would have seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Observed 2 spherical unknown airborne objects moving in sync.;2014-06-14 19:10:00;15 minutes;Observed 2 spherical unknown airborne objects moving in sync. June 14th, 2014, 7:10 PM PST  Odd sighting of unknown airborne objects.   My family with, my kids and their kids were out on our deck in East Hills, San Jose, CA (just below Mt. Hamilton).  My daughter was pointing out a large jet airliner traveling South from the North to our grandson, and she noticed way above the jet two objects traveling West from East that were moving very slowly together much that appeared to be much higher than the jetliner.   We all then looked from her pointing them out.  My first thought was balloons, but because they were moving so perfectly together (in sync) slowly and going against the wind and clouds.   The clouds were coming in from the North West going east.  Not sure if it was light reflecting off of them, but they appeared to have small arced wings, again most likely spheres?   We watched for about 15 minutes and then it just disappeared in some clouds.    My whole family saw them, and we can only say there were like nothing we've seen before in our area.    We do have a lot of jetliner activity over our area going from SF to LA (North to South). Spheres, commercial sub-orbitals, balloons, or small drones?  I do know that NORAD had two Russian jets that flew 50 miles outside CA coast, not long ago.    http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3166571/posts;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

10 Red-Fiery Lights with Red flame-like-flares coming from the sides flew over San Jose, California 95111;2015-02-01 20:30:00;30 minutes;10 Red-Fiery Lights with Red flame-like-flares coming from the sides flew over San Jose, California 95111 The moon was bright and it was a cloudless night.  I was in my hot tub just looking at the stars and there appeared a round red fiery light with red flame-like flares coming from the sides of the UFO.  It was traveling in a straight line from the West going East.  It was the most spectacular thing I have ever seen in the sky.  As I watched it travel across the sky, I was wishing I had my camera. To my great surprise, right before the UFO disappeared, another UFO came into view following the same path as the first one.  It was exactly the same, flying the same speed and everything.  I yelled louder and louder for my wife to come outside.  She came outside half dressed to see what I was yelling about.  She saw the UFO and was greatly amazed also. She went back into the house and got her camera and started taking shots of the UFO’s.  I went into the house also and got my camera so I could try and get some shots.  I was able to shoot about 50 shots but only some came out.  I do have some interesting shots even if they are not great.  My wife took about 10 shots and some of hers came out good also. It was very amazing because the UFO’s kept on coming out of the West.  As soon as one got about three-quarter of the way across the sky another one would show up.  There were a total of 9 or 10 UFO’s that flew over my house.  At one point it appeared that one of the UFO’s stopped and the other one that was following started catching up.  One of the craft appeared to be higher in the sky as they got closer to each other.  The closes they got together was about the distance of two moons apart, then they move on and disappeared.  At one time I could see three UFO’s all in a row traveling the same path then one would wink out and the the next one would disappear and so on.  It seems some of the craft had different spacing that others.  They were not all the same distance apart as they traveled across the sky. This happened between 8:30 PM and 9:00 PM on Sunday February 1, 2015, above San Jose, California 95111 USA.  In general the UFO’s were a round shape.  The craft was round and the red fiery like flames were toward the front on both sides and also toward the rear on both sides.   The UFO’s came out of the West (Pacific Ocean), they were traveling almost due East (East Coast)  The first 5 or 6 UFO’s all had a “halo” of red-flame-like-flares coming from the front sides of and the rear sides of the round body of the craft.  All craft followed the same course West to East and also about the same path (a straight line across the sky)  There were no commercial planes in the sky that I could see during this time  The moon was very bright it seemed I almost needed sunglasses  The red glow of the craft got brighter as they came from the West and when they were three-quarters of the way across the sky they were the brightest. When they passed the three-quarters mark they started losing their glow and soon winked out and were gone. It seem they all disappeared in about the same part of the sky My photos were taken with a Nikon D800 with AF-S Nikkor 23-120 mm 1:4 G ED lens about 50 photos  My wife’s photos were taken with a Nikon Coolpix P510 Nikkor 42X Wide Optical Zoom ED V 4.3 - 180mm 1:3-5.9 lens   The craft had different distances between them  As I looked to the South the crafts were traveling West to East below Orion’s Belt and below the moon’s position in the sky I will submit Photos as soon as I figure out how (on February 4th, 2015);37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

Spherical-shaped UFO sighting in Almaden Quicksilver Park, San Jose, CA;2021-07-24 14:40:00;Under 10 seconds;Spherical-shaped UFO sighting in Almaden Quicksilver Park, San Jose, CA I was hiking with my daughter in Almaden Quicksilver Park, San Jose. This is next to Mnt. Umunhum, where an old Air Force base resides on top of the mountain. The large rectangular building on top of the mountain is very prominent and often referred to as the cube. My daughter and I were looking at one of the huge power line structures just off the trail. My daughter walked off the trail, toward the structure, while I looked up at the birds sitting on top of it. I believe we were facing south and part of the sky was in view but there were also trees partially blocking the view as well. I saw a bright spherically-shaped object flying right to left at what appeared to be a very fast speed. The object appeared to be emitting a bright white light all around it, yet had a slight silver shimmer to it as if the sun was also partially reflecting off of it. My daughter did not see the object from her vantage point. We walked a few yards down the trail whe! re we could get a good view of the horizon (no trees in the way) but the object was long gone. I wish I had my phone out to take a video but it was gone in a matter of seconds. It was definitely not a plane, not a drone, and not a bird.  It is difficult to determine how large the object was. It looked extremely high-tech.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
