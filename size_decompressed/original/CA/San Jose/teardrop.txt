I was standing on a train platform in San Jose California, I had just checked my radio controlled Casio wristwatch watch, it was 1:38 pm, when my coworker our engineer said hey look there, he was pointing up in the sky towards the east by south east. I looked where he was pointing, the sky was very clear there were a lot of clouds as we were having rain showers that day, which made the sky very clear and free of dust and pollutants.  What I saw, at first glance, I and my coworker thought to be a weather balloon moving from east by south east towards north by north west in a straight line, moving at a high rate of speed. However, I quickly realized it was moving against the prevailing winds which were pushing the clouds in a northeasterly direction.  The object I believe to be small about the size of a midsized compact car. The object appeared to have a shape similar to a light bulb. The front was round and it tapered to a small almost pointed tail. The object was brightly polished gold metallic in color as the front bulbous area reflected the sun as it moved away from us.  The object was well above the clouds, its speed did not vary, and the object did not tumble or roll or vary its direction. We are just about one mile from the San Jose International Air Port. The jet planes that were crossing over at this time were moving much slower than the object.  The object did not leave a trail behind it, neither was there a flame coming out its tail end, it did not have wings, and it did not have a tail that would control its movement.  As the object was moving directly over us its bottoms color seemed to very in intensity like waves in a darker shade that moved from the front to the rear.  From the time we started to observe the object the object remained in sight for about 40 to 45 seconds.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
East San Jose - Large metallic object with lights hovering and moving slow across East foothills;2014-10-05 23:00:00;20 minutes;East San Jose - Large metallic object with lights hovering and moving slow across East foothills The large object appeared from behind trees in the distance (approx. over Eastside San Jose) and hovered for about a minute.  It was moving  South to North along the East foothills.  It moved extremely slow and would stop and hover from 30 seconds to a couple minutes each time. Looking through binoculars -  It was a teardrop on its side – round at front and pointed in back.  It was illuminated in front half – I could see metallic reflection. The back end had red, blue/green, and white lights.  There were other aircraft in the area that were clearly smaller as if they could fit inside this huge object.  When they looked like they might be going towards it the large object would brighten and flash 3 large red lights in triangle formation.  It travelled into my site and travelled out behind trees, poles and houses.  It had to have come from Gilroy area (South) going North towards Oakland/San Francisco.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

Bright greenish orb with reddish tail fell at 45 degree angle over West San Jose.;2016-10-01 20:35:00;15 seconds;Bright greenish orb with reddish tail fell at 45 degree angle over West San Jose. We were driving South on 880 (Nimitz Freeway) and we saw a large bright greenish circle with a tail--sort of tear-drop shaped-- with a bright reddish back edge falling at a 45 degree angle from left to right towards the ground in West San Jose.  We were South of the San Jose Airport's usual landing pattern and this object appeared to fall/descend too quickly to be a safe conventional aircraft landing.
