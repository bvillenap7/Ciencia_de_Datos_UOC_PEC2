First Encounter: I was 14 years old or so.;1974-05-15 12:00:00;3 minutes;First Encounter: I was 14 years old or so. Riding my bike home from a store and my brother 13, was with me on his bike. A semi-busy street, mostly sunny day, some broken high clouds, bright sky, about 12 noon. I noticed two boys directly across the street from us going the opposite direction on their bikes. One of those two boys had stopped and was pointing straight up into the sky. I was intrigued so I stopped my bike to look up.  My brother asked me, what are you doing? I said look! I was looking at a round metalic object about 10,000+ feet straight up. It was rotating in a curricular motion. It had a white bubble on the middle bottom.  It was not moving other than the circular rotating.  The object seemed blurry possibly due to it's distance and/or a heat source emitting from the object. My brother said what is that! And I immediately responded, a UFO! Suddenly, as if the object realized it could be seen, it went left and right at an extreme speed and then it went higher very quickly in a bit of a spiral motion as it did leave a chemtrail until it reached a certain altitude and then it went poof! Disappeared. No sound was heard.  Both sets of bike riders went their separate ways.  I have always wondered what made that boy notice it before I did.

My Second Encounter.;1990-08-15 22:00:00;5 minutes or 5 hours;My Second Encounter. Close Encounter: 16 years after my first sighting. I had driven 1,000 miles from Spokane, WA where I was living to San Jose, CA where I grew up. I had stopped at Sacramento, CA to take a required 1 day class I needed to take. Only my mom and dad where living in the home and they had went to bed in the back of the house at 10:00pm. So I lay down to sleep on the couch in the livingroom which had two large uncurtained windows directly in front of me at my feet about 12 feet from my feet. As I lay there thinking about my day and many things on my mind still very much awake, able to hear the sound of traffic on the nearby road and fire truck sirens which were common, as well as the sound of the kitchen refrigerator and the nearby grandfather clock to my left, I noticed thru the large windows at my feet, what looked like helicopters in the distance traveling left and right with a large bright white search light going straight down from each one. I estimated 3 or 4 of these were in the air just from my view. These objects were flying at a low altitude of 500 ft. or so. Suddenly one of them changed direction and began to come straight toward me. I noticed there was no sound and that scared me because helicopters are loud. As it got closer, I slowly pulled the blanket over my head hoping not to be seen. Suddenly there was a very loud roaring sound kinda like an engine but like none I ever heard. More like an electrical hum. The room became very bright with an extremely white light that was so bright it was hard to look at. I was frozen in fear. The room being very loud and very bright. Couldn't see anything. Just bright white.  Suddenly, I saw them. Three of them. They were standing right next to me on my left. They were hard to see in the brightness of the white that filled the room. In that brightness, they appeared dark, possibly black with two large even darker eyes. Strange shaped head, long skinny arms with an elbow. Only two maybe three fingers. All three of them were reaching out toward my body touching or poking at me. And they were also looking at each other. I could hear nothing due to the lound electrical hum in the room. Suddenly, all the sound was gone. The three entities were gone. The room was still completely white. I could see nothing. Then a small round hole began to open up on the large window so that I could see the sky thru it. The rest of the room still bright white. The hole became larger and larger until the white was gone. As my hearing also began to return, I noticed I was beginning to hear the grandfather clock at my left and the refrigerator in the kitchen. But no street traffic, no sirens. It was very quiet and that confused me because 5 minutes ago, I was hearing the traffic. I turned to look at the grandfather clock and it read 3:00am. Five hours had passed in what felt like 5 minutes.  To this day I believe that I was abducted for 5 hours. My parents did not see or hear anything.  I have wondered since then if they implanted anything in me.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

It made no sound ;1993-06-01 21:00:00;5 minutes;I eye witnessed a floresent orange object that ended up darted off into deep space at light speed (lightning speed).  It made no sound despite the great feat it managed.  It was some type of unkown to man technology.  It must have been nuclear powered. [This event happened some years ago when I was about 22-23 I am 30 now] I was playing pool with a freind in his garage on a weekend night.  Two of his younger relatives (around 12 yrs old at that time) then came running into the gargage with their hands up in the air yelling look outside look outside hurry up your gonna miss it. My friend and I hurried outside with the two boys and they pointed to a strange object in the sky.  It was a florescent orange object moving very slowly toward us.  We whatched in awe for several minutes trying to figure  out what it was.  I coulnd't identify it as an aircraft because it didn't have blinking lights or even resemble anything I have ever seen (my dad used to own his own Aircraft Repair hanger, I have seen many types of conventional aircraft in my time).  I could see a shadow of a structure above the orange glow, it must have been pretty large.  Suddenly it dripped a large tear on fire (similar to orange molten lava dripping) down to earth.  Next it folded over and we could now see two florescent orange glowing circles.  The tear burn't out before it made it to the ground.  It started to climb rapidly and all the sudden it darted off into space in a straight line at lightning speed (or maybe even faster).  My friend later described the way it darted off as being plucked out from space (imagine a catpult slinging something).  During our entire sighting it made no sound and left no trail.  We were standing in an empty parking lot (Snell Rd / Blossom Hill Rd) behind the grocery store when we saw it.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

However, fighter a/c do not stop.);37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Looked like very bright stars over San Jose Ca, but stars don't float that fast across the sky!;2002-04-17 20:55:00;35 seconds;Looked like very bright stars over San Jose Ca, but stars don't float that fast across the sky! Last night(April 17th 2002 at 9:55 pm) my husband had his telescope out to show me how bright venus was. He also was pointing to other planets telling me what they were. I got cold (actually I got bored) and went back into the house.  A few minutes later he stuck his head in the door, and said you gotta come see this! His eyes were bulging out of his head so I thought maybe I should go.  He pointed to what looked like 2 VERY bright stars.  One higher than the other. They sorta looked like other group of stars to me, so I said ya, what about them?  He said MY GOD, THEY ARE MOVING.  I took a better look and sure enough they were not moving like a plane would, but more like floating and floating very fast. They were both moving at the same pace, one was higher than the other.  They were moving from north west to south east.  It only took say 30 seconds to move from one side of the sky all the way to the other side.  Then all of the sudden the bottom one disapered, right while I was watching! Then within 2 seconds the top one just vanished.  Where they were floating it was perfectly clear skys. There were several airplanes in the area, so we could compare movement and lights.  These were very different.  The light was so intense, especially for as high as they were, Like I said when we first saw them they looked the same size and as far away as the stars.  Only these were brighter. And the way they just seemed to float or, I don't even know how to explain it exactly. It was just so different.  And they were in perfect harmony with each other. It was 2 crafts, not one with two lights. Well, it was quite a site that we will never forget.  To bad neither one of us thought to swing that telescope around and have a better look.  But really they were flying to fast for that.  Guess I'll have to go star gazing with my husband more often... I never thought it could be so exciting.

very small spheres, three one frame flashes at equal time and distance intervals;2002-04-25 11:30:00;2 seconds;very small spheres, three one frame flashes at equal time and distance intervals Honestly I'm not sure what I've got in this video (taken with a Cannon XL1 mini DV camera.  There are 2 instances that night while shooting a local commercial spot (I'm not sure of the exact date by the way.)  One video clip shows a very small cigar shaped object similar to one I've seen in other video clips. It is maybe one inch long or so and pops into the frame at what seems to be around 60 in/sec (2 or so in into the frame if measured from the bottom, may have come from the top.)  Unfortunately this sighting is only one frame long (1/30 sec.) as it is the last frame of the shot. The second one is a little bit more valid.  As I was going frame by frame in another clip to find where I wanted to cut it I found one frame with what seemed at first to be a pair of headlights in a window reflection until it dawned on me that it was only one frame of video.  There were two very small round objects about 1/2 - 3/4 in apart apparently white in color.  What I found strange was that 1 sec 8 frames later the same two round objects, the same distance apart flashed again only for one frame about 6 inches or so away and once again 1 sec. 7 frames later about another 6 inches, traveling left to right across the screen before disappearing into the lights.  there are a total of three one frame (1/30 sec) flashes with a definite trajectory all equal in time and distance apart. The objects also stay the same ditance apart from each other. The rate of travel is not very fast (less than 1 foot/sec)so my guess is that these are very small spheres of light emitted from something even smaller than they are.  These spheres are too small to show any kind of detail even with a pro quality camera.

Green object in San Jose, CA;2002-05-11 01:00:00;2 seconds;Green object in San Jose, CA Sitting on the PC at 1am. Lights on in the room....next to a window. No visible stars could be seen due to the light on in the room. Look out the window as something caught my eye.... At that point I watched a green light float down to the ground apparently....my first reaction was that it was a flare....but the light was consistent and color did not fade or vary at any point. Speed was slower than a typical shooting star by a wide margin. I have seen comets....but there was no typical tail to this object. just a floating circle....in a straight line to the ground. Then no more sightings. Before this happened...I was intrigued by the sound of a helicopter, which at this time in the night is rare unless it is a police copter....I know the San Jose copter is very quiet due to high tech blades it has for low level flying and stealth. The copter I heard was flying just before the incedent for about 15 minutes before it went out of range....but though I searched for the copter with lights off for 5 minutes....no lights were seen. Then 5-10 minutes later ...I saw the light.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

Cloud form moving with intent, providing cover for multiple circular lights as they passed over a city;2002-07-01 11:45:00;1 - 2 Minutes;Cloud form moving with intent, providing cover for multiple circular lights as they passed over a city When I was around 15 years old, my family lived in the Santa Teresa/Bernal area of South San Jose. My house sat directly at the bottom of the western foothills of Santa Teresa County Park in a small cul de sac between Bernal Middle School and the Norred/Mine Trailheads off of Heaton Moor.  My friend and I had taken my dog to Bernal middle school to skateboard on the large blacktop area near the baseball field and open grass area the school had. My dog was chasing us around, we could hear the sound of the neighborhood, cars driving around, neighboring houses playing music etc. Everything was completely normal. My dog began barking in the western direction towards (what we thought at the time) the houses that had backyards whose fences lined the blacktop area and field areas.  I was attempting to calm him when I noticed in the clear blue sky above us a large pure white cloud was moving quickly over the western foothills and crossing the valley that San Jose is nestled in. It was moving in a straight line in an easterly direction and within seconds had bisected the valley from East to West.  I called my friends attention to the strange cloud, as the sky was clear blue for as far as the eye could see in every direction from North to South. We looked on in amazement as 15 to 20 pink circles moved through the cloud from East to West. They moved relatively quickly, each at an even pace in no particular order or formation from the Western foothills to the Eastern Foothills.  Each circular light was about the size of a quarter if you held it at arms length to the sky.  I don't know if it was the shock of the experience or the OZ effect, but all other sound disappeared (from my recollection at least). My dog was no longer barking but sitting and staring with us at the sky.  As soon as the last circle passed over the eastern hills and out of sight the tail of the cloud followed and quickly moved across the valley and out of sight to the East.  This has one of two UFO sightings I have experienced in my life. The second can have a possible logical explanation, but without further evidence remains unidentified. This experience was wholly otherworldly.  It occurred in broad daylight. When I questioned other people that day and around the same time not a single person had seen a thing. If it weren't for my friend being with me I would not be able to believe this memory to be real.  Everytime I speak to this old friend I actually have to ask if he too remembers this occurance just to remind myself that I am not crazy.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

((COPIED CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Dear Ms. ((deleted)) Thank you very much for your report!  What was the apparent size of the light, please, relative to the size of a star in the night sky?  Do you think that the object might have been a satellite, by any chance?  How much of the sky, in terms of degrees of arc, did the object cover during the 14, or so, seconds you witnessed it, please? Thank you, again, for sharing the information with our Center!  Cordially,  Peter Davenport, Director NUFORC ((END NOTE)) ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, This object was 1/4  the size of the moon. (Same brightness as a full moon)  Not a satellite as I have seen many satellites and the movement of this,  was, in comparison, similar to that of a shooting star in terms of rapidity.   From my field of view the object covered about  half of the horizon from my bedroom window in those few seconds. It  was traveling at an incredible  rate of speed without sound.     I had, in fact, last year reported something very similar on your network, however the size of this was remarkable today.  Coincidentally, the former sighting occurred at roughly the same time of day, although that object was traveling from North to South. Could it be North Korea? Ha!

Bright object over mt umunhum, vertically rises, saucer shaped object over san jose.;2012-10-03 20:20:00;5 minutes;Bright object over mt umunhum, vertically rises, saucer shaped object over san jose. Its barely night and Mt umunhum has a height of about 3400 feet, and I saw a bright object flying from the south toward/over Mt umunhum at about 1/2 distance higher than the moutnain or about 5500ft. The reason I noticed this was odd is because it did not fly on the standard flight paths used by military or commercial planes following over and into San Jose International Airport.  The military craft fly over south-west San Jose at about 30-40000 feet, nightly every 15 minutes or so. I noticed this object-light was different so I ran in the house to get a camera. Within the 15 or 20 seconds of getting the camera and getting back outside, the object-light was gone...I could not believe it.  I know spaceships exist, and have no doubt, so I started looking for it directly above the earth. Behold, about 30 to 40,000 feet I saw a saucer shaped object flying over ahead continuing toward San Francisco. I was facinated on how fast this object was able to vertically rise from about 5500 feet to 30-40,000 feet in about 15 to 20 seconds.  Unfortunately I was not able to see the vertical rise while I was getting the camera.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Yellow-green-white lighted objects flying over mt umunhum mountain range.;2012-10-04 20:45:00;20 minutes;yellow-green-white lighted objects flying over mt umunhum mountain range A strange streak of yellow-green-white light falls from the sky, falls behind or toward Mt umunhum in the horizon.  I lost sight when it hit the earth due to the roof tops of houses.  The interesting thing about this light and tail was it did not appear falling from outer space as though it was coming through the atmosphere. It only seemed to leave a tail in the lower half of the sky.  Normally when an object falls from space you see a tail in the top half of the sky which burns out in the lower half.  This was opposite, the tail dropped from half-way up in the sky into the earth horizon of Mt umunhum. Coincidentally about an half-hour later I was walking and noticed two lights flying low over the Mt umunhum mountain range.  At first look it seemed like one object, but later after they turned south I noticed the lights were independent.  It was two separate objects, presenting a flight path similar to a military excerise flying over mountains.  Very unusual to see in a very populated San Jose Bay Area.  They were not flying the usual flight paths. The fascinating thing about the ojects was that they had a glow of green-yellow-white lights similar to the object that fell vertical out of the sky about 30 minutes eariler. These are just two of the six incidents of UFO objects I have seen around Mt umunhum in the past 6 weeks.  These objects or events seem to occur around 8:15 to 9:30 pm when I noticed them...just after dark.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

In addition to the fireworks, the usual commercial airliners were visible (our house is under flight paths for SJO, Moffet Air Field, and several local airports).   When we looked out to the area of sky above the house across the street (300deg NW), we saw two objects that appeared star-like, but were moving quite slowly in a northerly path and had blinking red-orange lights.  There were two commercial airplanes in the vicinity that were travelling at much faster speeds and were audible.   The two lights suddenly disappeared and within 10 seconds a single similar light appeared in the direction of magnetic north, slowly ascended in altitude before suddenly vanishing.  We were unable to see any further similar objects, though we continued searching the sky for approximately 30 minutes after we lost sight of the object. This is our secong New Year's experience, though the last year's experience was with a differnet light pattern and possible craft outline.   While my aunt and I are always excited to see unidentified lights and keep binoculars and cameras at the ready, our neighbors are quite frightened of the lights, often wanting to return to the perceived safety of the indoors.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
