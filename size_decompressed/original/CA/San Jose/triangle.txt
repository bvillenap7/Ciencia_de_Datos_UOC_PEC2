triangles made of 9 lights--no object seen;1973-06-15 22:30:00;15min+;triangles made of 9 lights--no object seen I submitted an account of this event two or three years ago. It apparently was not received, as it is not in the website database. Since that submission, my recollection of the event has improved and therefore changed somewhat.  This is a recollection of a sighting of unknown lights in an unusual pattern sometime in the early 1970's, perhaps 1973 or 1974. I have tried to remember details and circumstances as accurately as possible. I am no aviation expert but I have grown up around aircraft, living near Reid-Hillview Airport, well before it was purchased by Santa Clara County and became a FSS, and I was acquanted with the former owner, his daughter and her family, as well as others who worked there or had tiedowns or hangars, so I know more than a little bit about aviation. There are some explanations for those who are unfamiliar with aviation as well as to explain why I do not believe that the lights belonged to any ordinary aircraft.  In the early 1970's I was at home during a late spring or summer evening and looked up to see nine orange/amber lights arrayed in three equilateral triangles which were themselves arrayed as one large equilateral triangle. Each orange light was at the point, or vertex, of each small triangle which themselves were at the points of the larger triangle, nine lights in all.  The night was warm and the smog was thick enough that no stars could be seen. There was no moon. Typically, above the smog, I am told there is a strong Westerly wind in the evening and into the night.  The array maintained perfect equilateral triangles as it headed roughly north-northwest in a straight line, It appeared to move slowly, like a light airplane but seemed to be silent. I watched the lights closely for some time, from when it was almost overhead, as it passed overhead and then was lost in the smog and reflected city lights somewhere over the north part of the city, trying to see the outline of some object and watching the lights to see if any moved independently, as well as for any lateral drift. I never could see any object, just the lights, none of the lights moved relative to the others and no lateral drift was observed. I estimated it could be seen for at least fifteen minutes.  The array was unusual as no navigation lights were seen: No red, no green, no white, no strobe or flashing lights of any kind, just steady orange/amber lights, which I realised later had the same color as low-pressure sodium street lights.  I know what aircraft look like in the sky at night, as I lived next to a small civil airport at that time and lived directly under the southbound departure route for the city's major airport and I often watched aircraft go over, trying to guess what kind it was. Sometimes, because of the smog, all that can be seen are the navigation lights. I have never seen such lights on any aircraft before or since. It occurred to me that the aircraft might have been some of the new SR-12's recently made public but the lights never moved relative to each other, they never drifted from course and there were no navigation lights, as would be required near the airports under VFR rules.  There was no engine noise. At the time, jet engines were still quite loud and some DC9's, 727's and 737's, as well as DC8's from Mexico were still using turbojets instead of the quieter fans. Neither turbine nor piston engines were heard.  The array was viewed through smog which reflected the streetlights so there was only a view of the orange/amber lights. No solid object was seen, no reflections. The smog was thick enough that no stars could be seen, neither could any aircraft from either airport. But somehow those lights could be seen.  Because of the smog,  the exceptionally slow speed and the lack of any visible shape I could not determine the altitude or the size of the object or objects attached to the lights.  I asked around to see if anyone else had seen the aray of lights no one had. The FAA and the local newspaper both pointedly expressed their lack of interest in the event. It remained forgotten until I saw another very unusual sky object while in Monterey. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Post earthquake flying Triangle gave us a quick visit.;1989-10-17 21:00:00;10 sec;Post earthquake flying Triangle gave us a quick visit. On the evening following the 7.1 Bay Area earthquake a friend and I were sitting outside our university dorm room waiting for the school to inspect our builings.It was a quiet and dark evening in down town San Jose as a result of the Quake. We were both starring straight up into the night sky and saw a triangle shape block out the stars directly above us. It swooped straight down from above just about 100 feet over us. It seemed as if it came from no were, as if it de-cloaked? Suddenly I saw the object's lights come on in a pattern outlining the triangle. And as quickly as my brain could make out what I was seeing it quickly accelerated off and vanished out of sight. The strange thing is even though the object felt like it was just above us neither of us could hear it. It moved in silents. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of this report elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was a clear starlit night when I noticed an object in the south-eastern sky.  At a distance I assumed it was an airplane on the flig;1997-12-01 21:45:00;2-3 min.;Summary : It was a clear starlit night when I noticed an object in the south-eastern sky.  At a distance I assumed it was an airplane on the flight path to the international airport in the north-west. When it got close, only five lights were visible in an enormous triangular configuration.  Three lights were large, bright white, unblinking, and made a smaller triangle at the forward point of the object, the other two lights were dim, white, unblinking, and at the other two corners of the larger triangle.  It was 3 or 4 times the size of a passenger jet, and under 2000 feet, but no engine noise could be heard. Monday, December 1, 1997 	At about 9:45PM tonight I was driving southward on the Monterey Highway when I noticed what was either an experimental air craft or else I’ve had a sighting of one of the new triangular ufos.  I initially thought I was observing the bright landing lights of a couple of incoming commercial jet liners, since they were in the usual flight path for San Jose International Airport from the southeast toward the northwest. 	However, when I was stopped at the signal near the Edenvale shopping center on the approach to the Blossom Hill underpass, I was able to clearly see something which was not a plane with which I am familiar.  I wondered if it might have been some kind of stealth plane, because I could not make out the body of the plane against the night sky.  All I could see was five lights. 	Three lights were very bright, they were larger than normal running lights, and they were arranged in a tight equilateral triangle on the bottom of what I thought may be a plane’s fuselage (the triangle was about the size of a silver dollar at arms length).  But, if it is a conventional or experimental airplane, the fuselage is two or three times as wide as most commercial jets.  There were also two small white lights placed where I imagined the wingtips were located aft of the triangle, (from the triangle to a “wingtip” was about the span of a 5 inch ruler held at arms length, or it was between 11 and 12 inches from tip to tip) but once again, they indicated a much wider wing span than is typical. 	Looking for a place to park and observe the craft, I rolled down the window and turned off the radio to see if I could hear the engine, but I could not.  It may have been too high, although its unusually large size indicated it was low enough to hear (perhaps a couple thousand feet above the highway).  If it was too high to hear, then its dimensions had to be too enormous to contemplate. 	I proceeded onto the cloverleaf and emerged slowly onto the eastbound side of Blossom Hill so I could look toward the craft’s flight path, but it was long gone.  Never-the-less, off in the distance, on the same path were some large red lights which I assumed were probably the tail lights of the same air craft, primarily because they also were much larger than the running lights of most planes. 	 	I also watched other planes to make a comparison.  As expected, I was able to clearly see the bodies of the other planes.  I also found that their lights were not configured like those of this large craft, nor were the lights as bright, or as large.  Furthermore, there were the usual flashing lights on the airplanes, but all the lights of the other craft were steady and unblinking.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

White triangular craft over San Jose CA in broad daylight.;2001-03-17 14:00:00;8 minutes;White triangular craft over San Jose CA in broad daylight. 2:20pm 3/17/01 It's a first for me as regards sightings. And right now it's a UFO, until I manage to identify it. Saturday March 17th 2001, visible from 1:55pm to 2:03pm. Trying to figure out how to call San Jose airport. Moving due south, spotted in Almaden Valley, from our garden. May have originated from somewhere near the airport, which lies almost due north of here about 5 miles. Height anywhere between 2000 and 10000 feet. No loss in height. No noise. Highly reflective on this sunny day with light clouds. Estimate speed over 100 knots. Visible for 8 minutes from zenith to 30 degrees above southerly horizon, when dwindled to a point. No course deviations observed. Wife saw it at zenith (90) down to about 80 degrees azimuth. Called me, and we both then tracked it until it disappeared into the distance. No time for telescopes or camera too busy trying to figure it out (hey, I'm a virgin UFO spotter so sue me). Wife asserts (too late for me to tell by the time I got there): * triangular * not a hang-glider (too fast) * not a balloon (wrong shape) * not a parachute (no height loss) * something swinging from the bottom. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2:45pm  3/17/01 I used to fly small planes, so I can say that as an ex-pilot I'm mystified. I called the airport ATC. * Nothing reported from San Jose ATC in the tower, except for a helicopter taking pictures close to the airport. * Wind on ground around 12 knots, little to no gusts. (So unless the wind increased to over 100 knots at a few thousand feet, this wasn't flying unpowered, therefore.) * Visibility: 10 miles. (So - and this is very rough - 10 miles in 8 minutes = 75 knots roughly. Agrees roughly with my estimates. Also, I reckon the visibility due south was more like 15 miles, which makes my estimate of 100 knots even closer.). A nice sunny day with very light and intermittent clouding. No clouds near the object for the entire time we tracked it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6pm 3/17/01 I expected to be excited and/or elated or something, but I guess today being tax return payment day, my reactions are dampened! Also, my wife got the best view, and all I saw was a bright, highly reflective object receding into the distance. We agreed that differentiating between a high large object travelling fast, and a lower, smaller object travelling slower, is damned difficult with no other nearby skycraft as references! There's some more info left out which my wife and I pulled together: 1. It seemed not to be metallic, but rather the texture of bright white silk. 2. The assemblage hanging down and swaying was entirely white, and the same colour as the triangle. It was about the same length as the traingle's span. The hanging part appeared to consist of a single U-loop of rope/cable, whereby nothing (e.g. a load, a person) was noticeable at the bottom of the U. 3. The triangle was neither thick nor thin maybe 10:1 ratio between span and thickness. It appeared to be a rigid body, unlike the hanging assemblage. 4. The prevailing wind, according to reports, was between 5 and 12 knots, at every altitude from zero to 10,000' MSL. It was in direction 310 degrees (out of the NW), which lines up pretty much with the observed course of the object. 5. We also discount a helicopter on two counts a) wrong shape b) no sound whatsoever. 6. The course of the object relative to our south-facing garden (from where we observed it) appeared to be about one half mile due east, so it did not travel directly overhead. 7. At zenith, when only my wife was observing, the angle subtended by the object was approximately that of an object of size 0.7 inches held at arm's length. When I observed it first, at roughly 80 degrees azimuth, it was about 0.3 inches, and dwindled down to a sparkling point as it receded. 8. At the time of the initial zenith sighting, my wife had been looking up because of the noise of a passenger jet flying by (to or from the nearby airport). If the object were making sound, this could have masked it until it was too distant to hear. Hypothesis: an electric hang glider? Andrew Palfreyman San Jose CA, 3/17/01 I am a professional engineer with over 30 years experience in electronics. I have a degree in physics from Oxford University UK. I am 51 years old. My wife is 30 years old, and has a degree from a Michigan university in theatre. We were both drinking non-alcoholic beverages (and we don't do drugs!) at the time of the sighting. It was a sunny day in the garden with the children, and we were both relaxed and fully aware. We were both  wearing our glasses during the sighting, so long-distance vision was excellent.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

Near dusk, but the sky was still bright blue. I saw two black, triangles hovering in a very slow flight pattern. They did not fly like our planes or birds. I watched for 10 minutes as they headed from the east to the west and then slowly, back toward the west again. They moved closer together, progressively and appeared to be about 45,000 feet, or possibly higher. Several jumbo jets passed by at maybe 15-20,000 feet during my observation, and these objects were clearly not flying like the planes, nor did they look anything like any kinds of planes I have ever seen. I am a private pilot and am familiar with flight patterns through the skies in this area.  I have also observed many birds of prey (hawks,and others, in this area and these objects were not like this animals. This is the first time I have ever observed anything like this. I have always been extremely skeptical about UFO's and have not really thought they were anything but mistaken identities. However, these objects were clearly some kind of object that I could not identify. I am wondering if anyone else observed them today.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Red & White Triangle;2003-09-25 21:00:00;4-7 minutes;Red & White Triangle As I was driving on the freeway between Gilroy and San Jose, Ca. I saw a bright white object (plane) on the side of the freeway. It was bright with several lights and looked like an odd lobster shape. The lights were at varying intensities of white light, sometimes becoming more intense and then a lighter dull and changing (very slowly). It was flying at such odd pace (kind of stopping and starting and very slow). Then as it made it's way over the freeway it turned and came towards the cars on the freeway. It stopped and hovered over the freeway. It was very close! with bright white and red lights. Then I saw it was triangular in shape. It was very still as it hovered the freeway and then I passed underneath it, the red lights were illuminating the entire bottom of the triangle and at each corner of the triangle was a bright white light. I saw directly underneath it as I drove underneath this hovering triangle and after I passed underneath it I turned around to look back at it and it disappeared. All that I saw was one bright white light that became bright in intensity and then flickered out. Also there were many other planes (objects) in the sky.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

Initally notice two or three small eye like lights, near the top of the object. I opened my eyes wider because I did not want to miss anything. The overall shape was like a small christmas tree with just 3 branches, an inverted V, a cone.  It was 2 feet tall.  It hovered and later moved  3 feet off of the floor.   However it was structured like a kids building toy - the one with the sticks and the round connectors.  The entire thing was like a dimly lite Transluscent pink light or peach colored christmas tree like structure. Clear translucent 1/2 diameter tubes about 5 inches long with 1 inch node like connectors and a node or nodes on the tips of the branch like structure.

2nd sighting Metallic object rotating in the morning sky.;2006-06-18 09:25:00;5 minutes;2nd sighting Metallic object rotating in the morning sky. This is the second Sunday morning in  two months that I have stepped unto my balcony, looked to the NW and observed this metallic-like sphere/triangle shaped object in the sky, very high up. Higher than a Skywriiting plane!  Each occurence has been against a crystal-clear bluesky backdrop.  You can make out that the object seems to rotate in place the sun can been seen glinting off the object as it rotates.  With the naked eye, it appears to be oval but in the picuture I canptured, zoomed in to 1600%, the object seems to be triangular. Each time I would call out my wife to confirm what I was seeing she could immediately see the object, on both occasions, and it looked to be the same object, in about the same  location in the sky. I also noted commercial airliners, high flying birds (gulls) and even the Moon these all  help reference how high the object was.  You would really have to be looking for it with the naked eye or you would simply see a clear blue sky.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

During this time I witnessed 10 moving lights. The first I seen one moving light or as i call them Traveling Stars! It was coming from the southeast moving north. It moved slowly, then disappeared. A moment later coming from the west another Traveling Star was going to the east. That as well disappeared. About 5 to 10 mins after that, i seen 3 Traveling Stars in a triangle formation, moving together slowly, then fast then slow again. I called my 22 year old nephew out side he came very fast, by the time he got out there was a 4th, they all moved together in like a alomst box formation, then the 4th disappeared and the 3 continued to move. I asked my nephew if he seen what i had seen and he said yes, and this time i dont know what to say! He was in shock. As we watched them go south, and disappear. 2 more came from the north and south, they were both moving in a slow manner, they were goign straight then the would move to the side. Now the movement goes for all traveling stars. Then when i was about to go into my house, 2 more came from the west and proceded to the east. I have to say this was so crazy.. They seem to come out more if I had my cell phone with me. I have observed this for some time. I think they like the light that flashes on my cell phone. Also there was one traveling star that was flashing it light and then it would disappear, i seen a total of 2 flasher!;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

On February 26th, 2015, at 12:30 AM, my friend accompanies me on a dog walk, as I get out of late.  I noticed a bright orange light, too orange to be a planet, in the sky.  Because it was moving slowly we agreed it was not a planet or meteorite.   I asked him, is that an airplane?  He answered no, if it was an airplane it appears it would be falling. It began to get slightly brighter and continued moving slowly.  Too slow to be an airplane, or helicopter, completely silent and nothing like we've both ever seen before.   My friend noted a triangular shape.   This  lasted a total of maybe three minutes.  Then, it began to get dimmer in brightness.  Then within a 5-10 second time span, it began to appear to blink, getting smaller and then completely disappeared.

I was taking my dog out for the night and looked up as I usually do.  Some movement in the sky caught my eye and upon focusing I found I was watching an unlit object cruising through the sky northward. The object banked slightly and I was able to make out a triangular shape.  The object made no noise that I noticed and had no lighting on the bottom or sides. (or at all)  The light pollution in the sky provided decent contrast with which to view the object.  It moved quickly through the sky and was only visible for approximately 10 seconds.  The object was moving substantially faster than any other aircraft I've seen to date.  It appeared to be much higher in altitude than most other aircraft as well.  (my viewing position was nearby an airport)  Being close to the airport, I commonly see all manner of aircraft which is precisely why this one stood out enough to make this report.  The speed of the object could be likened to a satellite transiting overhead.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

Triangle  3 minutes  I saw 3 red small lights in a fixed triangular formation traveling very slow. I was visiting McDonald's restaurant last night on Blossom Hill Rd. and Kooser Ave. while sitting in my car in the parking lot with the window open I started hearing a noise that sounded like someone dragging a big bag of rocks across the sidewalk very slowly. as I exited my vehicle I looked up above my head into the night sky.  I saw 3 distinct small red lights in triangular formation that were blinking together but not always consistent.  This area above my head in the sky always has heavy commercial airline traffic.  The lights traveled in such a consistent orientation that it led me to believe that this was 1 craft, and not 3 separate crafts.  The speed of this craft was very slow.  I observed that this craft was also well under the elevation of the airport traffic itself.  I have seen planes land and take off at night and day and am familiar with the mass silhouette of area that the wings and fuselage cover. this craft by comparison was maybe 9 to 10 times the size of a full moon in the night sky. as it passed over my head I was trying to determine the shape of this craft.  I did not see any defining edges to this craft no matter where I looked for it.  It is as if the lights were visible but not the craft.  The best way to describe what I saw while looking for defining edges was that this craft appeared to me to be cloaked. showing 3 lights in triangular formation that were on a craft that was cloaked from my view.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
