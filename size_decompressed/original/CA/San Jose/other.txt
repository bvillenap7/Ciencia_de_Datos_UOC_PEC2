Lower than the peak of the surrounding hills.  When I fully became aware of the UFO it stopped in its place. As if it noticed me.  From my peripheral vision an identical craft floated and stopped right next to the original one.  The two crafts stayed next to each other for a moment.  Until eventually the second one took off into space in an instant.  Leaving a trail of light that curved as it shot into outer space.  The original craft stayed and hovered there until I could no longer see it.  This was event was profound to me as I actually saw the UFO take off at light speed into space.  Opening up my mind to the idea that the impossible is reality.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
