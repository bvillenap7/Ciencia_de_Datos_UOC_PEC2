The overcast north-eastern sky was flashing like a strobe light, lighting up the entire horizon.;1999-02-20 20:20:00;10 Seconds;The overcast north-eastern sky was flashing like a strobe light, lighting up the entire horizon. This is not a report of a craft sighting, rather, it is a report of an unusual event seen in the sky.  The event was witnessed from San Jose, California, just north of the Almaden Valley.  It was exactly 8:20 pm, Pacific time, on Saturday, February 20, 1999.  The sky was overcast. I was inside the office in my house, and I happened to glance out the office window, which faces due East.  In the nort-eastern sky, I noticed that the entire sky was flashing quickly and regularly, like a strobe light, only slower.  The flashes were bright enough to have been lightening, but I doubt they were, because they were too frequent, and too regular in frequency.  I would estimate the frequency of the flashes to be around 4-5 flashes per second, evenly spaced in time. The entire duration of my sighting was approximately 10 seconds.  The entire portion of the sky that I could see was lighting up, but it definitely appeared as though the source of the flashing lights was in the north-eastern sky, which happens to be the approximate direction of the Mount Hamilton observatory (I think that's the name of it -- during the day, the telescope is visible on the mountain top).  Just for reference, the San Jose airport is north-west of my house, and would have been roughly at my back at the time of this incident.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Grays up in my FACE!;1999-07-07 03:00:00;1 Sec;Grays up in my FACE! I actually saw a Gray up in my face when I was in high school from 1995 through 1999.  I'm 28 years old now.  They Gray had slanted eyes and words can't describe the skin.  I just know it glowed like the moon times 5.  Well, it showed up right next to my face and I flipped over to look up at the ceiling because my heart was pounding like it was gonna explode out my chest because I was so scared at the time and then it was gone when I looked over.  Don't know what it wanted from me because I ain't got nothing it wants. Never heard or seen from it again.  Didn't know who to report it too at that time so was just a memory. Just watched 4th kind and it sparked answers. That's all I remembered. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

Ilistened to the radio, but no one reported it, surprisingly. My friend said she saw the same event twice in the sameplace in quick succession, I only caughtthe last event. The streak came from nowhere and an object appeared, also green and then faded, (not reducing in size apparently) distance could have been in orbit or very high up. I have previously (in the last few months at different times, again travelling on HW680) twice seen bright blue balls of light descending at night towards Moffet Field direction-don't know if that is something they were doing (Nasa Aimes is there too) I have often seen shooting starts (meteors) but nothing even remotely like this. I am a CEO of a small telecommunications company (Engineering background), my friend is a Director of Montessori Academy. Driving on 680 south at 9.00 am 8-25-99, both I travelling in my car and my friend who was on the same freeway heading the same southerly direction saw something in the bright blue sky above and slightly south of us. I noticed a green (bright light color)streak, but instead of the streak disappearing into nothing it became more intese and bigger resulting in some kind of object. The object was green for 2-3 seconds and totally vanished. My friend said she saw exactly the same thing, only it had repeated twice. I only saw it the once. I have seen glowing blue balls before descending quickly in the Moffett Field/Nasa Aimes direction. his happened several months ago, I did not report it then. I am now very convinced that soemthing is going on. Note the object got bigger after a trail, not the reverse which would suggest a meteor perhaps. The object appeared last, and from the distance could have been any shape, the duration was several seconds, but very very bright and very observable for anyone with good peripheral vision on the freeway.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

I saw what, at first, I thought was a star, but object didn't seem to be furthur than the atmosphere, object was completely stationary, not moving as a meteor would be or satelite going by. I saw two plans heading in different directions in the sky at the same time and noted them as pasenger airlines. After 20 to 25 seconds of viewing it seemed to dim as if a faint cloud had past before it... (althought the sky was prefectly cloudless, although a bit smoggy) object became increasingly fainter then seemed to be two or posible three objects then faded completely, as if turning off a light.  I wasn't sure who to report this to so I did a search on yahoo and found this site. I have never seen nor reported any abnormal object before.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

Shiny object moving slowly then rapidly up into the atmosphere.;2004-07-17 12:10:00;3 minutes;Shiny object moving slowly then rapidly up into the atmosphere. It was around noon time and I was traveling in San Jose going north on Saratoga Ave. south of 280 hwy. While at a stop light, I a bright shiny object was up in the sky ahead of me in my field of view. I could see other objects that were flying in the sky over San Jose. All objects in the sky were aircraft except one object that stood out and was obviously not an airplane or jet or helicopter. This object was moving very slowly at first giving the impression that it may be hovering. Then the object seemed to suddenly move rapidly and then slow to a stand still. The traffic light turned green and I turned off into a parking lot to get out of my car and observe this shiny object and to determine what it was. I saw that the object was slowly moving southeast. I was wearing sunglasses but still could not make out its exact shape. My best guess was that it looked like three bright shiny baloons or spheres connected together that seemed to reflect suns light or emit bright white light. The baloons or speres of light seemed to change shapes. It took the shape of a triangle and then change to form a cylinder shape. Two minutes passed and the object seemed to quickly ascend high in the atmosphere and appeared to look like a bright star and climbing much higher and going east south east and getting harder to see. I hope someone else will report seeing this because I know that it had to be seen by a lot of people especially those traveling north on Saratoga ave toward 280 hwy during noon time.

2 quick flashes of light distant from eachother appeared in the sky over the Santa Cruz mountains.;2004-07-26 02:24:00;1 minute;Cloudless night. Was looking at the stars on my back patio and noticed a tiny blue flash which appeared to be far too high for a plane and not the proper colors. I expected it to be a plane however and watched for its lights to trail off. No lights appeared until about 30 seconds later. A second blue flash appeared slighty east in the sky from the orgin. This dispelled my guess of it being a star.  In Summary: 2 quick flashes of light distant from eachother appeared in the sky over the Santa Cruz mountains.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

Possible Chinese Spacecraft Launch??;2005-10-12 22:00:00;5 minutes;Possible Chinese Spacecraft Launch?? I was sitting in my living room watching TV when I heard a fairly loud, deep rumbling noise coming from outside that lasted approximately one minute, that sounded different than any normal aircraft that I know of.  I then went outside to investigate and looked up at the night sky and noticed an odd, wide, fairly short contrail situated right next to the moon.  It looked to me like it possibly could have come from a Vandenberg missile launch (I've seen several of them in my lifetime out here on the West Coast). I called Vandenberg today and was told there was no missile launch from them last night.  I ran across news reports online today of the launch of a two manned spacecraft in northwestern China yesterday morning, and the time of that launch seems to correspond with the time that I experienced the rumbling and observed the contrail.  I checked and noted my local time before I went outside to look around, and it was 10:00 PM PST exactly.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Possible Explanations For Roaring Noises?;2008-02-06 23:00:00;8 minutes;Possible Explanations For Roaring Noises? I also experienced the intermittent, fairly loud roaring sound that other people reported here around San Jose on the evening of Feb. 6th at approximately 11:00 PM. It seemed to be a deep, low, intense rumbling off in the distance from my southwest San Jose location, that would stop and then start back up again. I could easily hear it while sitting and listening puzzledly at my computer within my enclosed apartment. I soon went outside and scanned the night sky, but couldn't see any aircraft that might be causing it. I even called a friend on the phone who lives a few doors down, but he didn't hear anything because of the volume of his TV.  I have heard something exactly like this several times before over the years in the Santa Clara Valley, and surmised that it could have been the NASA Ames wind tunnel that was producing it. That's what I had read in the newspaper and saw reported on TV previously when I had heard this same kind of sound in years past.  Also, there is/was? a rocket motor test facility south of San Jose that could also be capable of producing this same kind of noise.  I'm not sure if either the wind tunnel or this rocket test facility are still currently in operation, but they both could be possible explanations for these sounds. Also, I thought it might possibly a loud jet engine at the airport, not following anti-noise procedures. Curfew at Mineta San Jose International Airport begins at 11:00 PM, but jets sometimes still do operate after that.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Roaring noise over house that started and stopped suddenly four times, appearing to originate from different directions.;2008-02-06 23:00:00;8 minutes;Roaring noise over house that started and stopped suddenly four times, appearing to originate from different directions. My girlfriend and I were watching TV in our room at around 11:00 PM when we heard a very loud roaring that sounded much like a large rocket booster and seemed to be right above the house. We live very near the San Jose International Airport, so hearing roaring noises in the sky is not unusual. What WAS unusual, however, was the volume, behavior, and the proximity of the sound to our home. 	The normal flight path of aircraft into San Jose international airport puts them a few miles east of our home. However, whatever was causing the sound seemed to be directly above our house. Furthermore, it didn’t get louder (approaching our home) and then quieter (passing over and leaving our home). Rather, it was a very loud, very steady roaring noise that sounded as if it was directly over our home. 	We were lying in bed, and we both heard this roaring in the background as we were watching TV. The longer it went on without changing in pitch or volume (which would be an indication of movement towards or away from our home), the more that sort of “there’s something wrong here” alarm was going off in my head. Finally, after about three minutes of this steady roaring, we both looked at each other at the same time and vocalized our mutual curiosity as to the nature of that sound. She said, “what is that noise?”. I jokingly replied that it was probably a UFO, and she should pack her nice clothes because we might be about to take a ride. As soon as I had finished saying that, the sound stopped instantly. There was no winding down, there was no lowing of decibels, it was as if someone had just flicked a switch and turned it off. As if that wasn’t enough, it started up again after a few seconds in what seemed to be a different part of the sky, but still very close. The start of the sound was as instantaneous as the ending. It was just suddenly “on” again. Again, there was an extremely loud, very steady roaring for about a minute, and then it stopped suddenly. 	At this point my girlfriend was actually getting scared. She had lived in this area all her life and had NEVER heard anything like this before. When the roaring started a third time, I jumped through our window into the back yard (there was no screen) so I could get a better look at the night sky to try and get a visual on whatever was causing this noise. I was able to determine that the roaring seemed to be coming from the South, but was unable to see the source. I ran over to the patio door and knocked on it to get the attention of my roommate who was playing video games at the time, and told him to come out and listen. He did, and said to me, “it’s probably just an airplane.” Then it stopped suddenly, as it had done twice before and his attitude changed. Again, it had lasted about a minute and stopped for a few seconds only to start up again this time on the NORTH side of my home. Now he was clearly as curios as I was about the origin of this sound. The rumbling/roaring sound went on for about thirty seconds or so this time before it again stopped suddenly. It did not start up again.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Two bright silent red lights coming in from west to east, ascending, light intensity increasing, headed west - and then disappeared.;2012-08-13 04:00:00;6 minutes;Two bright silent red lights coming in from west to east, ascending, light intensity increasing, headed west - and then disappeared. This description was reported in an earlier report – this is what we saw – with the exception there were 2 separate red steady lights – (similar report) Bright light high in sky that went out to a very dim red light traveling north to southwest just west of the dipper.   First one spotted was heading west to east – then started to ascend  - there was no noise.   The intensity of the light increased before ascension.  The second craft was coming in eastbound on apparently the same path – followed the first – and ascended.   Once high(er) – the light grew very dim.  There was no sound.  It moved in a way that seemed to be controlled but was curious.  The speed heading west seemed to be very fast after apparently not moving real fast.  The other witness and I couldn't really describe what we saw as relating to any modern aircraft that we are aware of.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Strange increasingly loud noise over East San Jose that is indescribable.;2013-01-31 04:10:00;5 minutes;Strange increasingly loud noise over East San Jose that is indescribable I was walking my dog in East San Jose, just off Berryessa Road.  The night was clear, with moon out.  Suddenly this sound started quietly at first and it got progressively louder.  I looked up and saw nothing except these three red and white blinking lights too far away so I dismissed them as being the source of this sound.  It grew louder and louder and I thought a plane was going to crash.  It was that sort of sound although I must say I've never heard a sound like this before.  After about 5 minutes it began to fade and dissappear.  I suddenly noticed this man walking across the street, in a dark hooded shirt, black pants.  He looked at me, several times, even turned around twice. I can't say I saw his facial features, just that he looked like a man.  He walked swiftly and then when I passed a tree near me and looked again he was gone.  Wish I could tell you more.  I did not see any craft just the loud roaring noise.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
This event was actually two related sightings on the same night at locations that were within 10 minutes of each other.;2015-12-14 22:40:00;20 seconds;This event was actually two related sightings on the same night at locations that were within 10 minutes of each other. The first sighting occurred at approximately 10:35 pm on Monday, 12/14/2015.  I was driving my car, turning right onto Cropley Ave. from Conifer Ln. in San Jose, CA.  As I looked left to make sure there was no oncoming traffic, I noticed quite a bright star streaking toward the easterly direction.  It lasted less than two seconds, tracing across perhaps a fifth of the sky. My first reaction was that I had seen a meteor.  But the object wasdefinitely a small round disc (like a golf ball seen at about 30 feet away).  The luminosity was similar to that of an LED light and, although moving rather fast, it did not exhibit a tail as the natural light from a meteor would do.  As I made the turn and continued to drive, I really didn't think anything more about it. My drive proceeded southwesterly along Cropley to Morrill Ave., turning right on Morrill to get to Landess Ave., where I then turned left.  Landess heads roughly westward and turns into Montague Expressway after the Highway 680 overcrossing.  I proceded southwestward down Montague, crossing over Highway 880, until I stopped at a red light at either Zanker Rd. or N. 1st St. (I'm not sure which one.)  The time was approximately 10:45 pm and it was here that I saw the golf-ball object again while looking up to the left through the windshield at about a 40 to 45 degree angle.  Instead of streaking as it did before, it made a sort of randomly hilly curve in the sky that lasted about as long as the first sighting. I was rather surprised, however, to see that (in the background sky of the golf-ball object) there were (I believe) eight lights of much lesser intensity than the golf-ball.  Each light was (as best I can describe it) shaped kind of like a flattened diamond. The most noticeable feature of these lights, to me, was that they were divided into two rows of four lights each, one row below the other by perhaps 5 to 10 degrees, from my vantage point.  Each row's lights were evenly spaced, and the bottom row's lights were aligned directly below the top row's.  The lights alternately dimmed and intensified, in unison, with a period of perhaps two to three seconds. As I stared at the configuration, I thought it might be due to an optical artifact of the area's street lights reflecting on my windshield.  But I rolled down my window and stuck my head outside to look they were still there. It also occurred to me that there could be Christmas lights on the top edge of a nearby building.  I wouldn't be able to see the building because it was night and the brighter street lights would interfere with any ambient backlighting behind the dark building.  However, at the angle and direction I was looking (~ 45 degrees up, southward), no buildings are that tall when one takes into account the distance between my stopped car at the intersection, and any building to the south. Finally, the lights could not lie on a possible power line because both rows were arranged absolutely ruler straight, whereas there would likely be a slight bow in the arrangement if attached to a power line (due to line sag). The whole sighting at the stopped light on Montague probably lasted about 15 to 20 seconds.  Just before my traffic light turned green, there were (I believe) three other cars at the intersection: one next to me on the right, one in the opposite direction that was beginning a turn northward onto the cross street, and one waiting on my left on the cross street, at his red light.  I looked to see if I could detect any awareness of the unidentified lights by the person on my right, but it was difficult to see the driver inside the car.  It seemed as if no one else noticed. The sighting was over when each row of lights split in half, two lights accelerating to the right, two accelerating to the left.  The intensity of the lights quickly dimmed to zero as their speed increased, and they never deviated from their ruler straight horizontal paths.
