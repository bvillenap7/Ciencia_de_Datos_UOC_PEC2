At the so;1974-10-20 07:00:00;5 minutes;The Santa Clara Valley is bordered on the east by the Hamilton mountain range, and on the west by Santa Cruz mountain range.  At the southwest corner of the valley, in the Santa Cruz range, sits Mt. Umnum.  Mt. Umnum was the sight of a very large and powerful US Air Force radar station. One clear cold autumn morning, I was sitting in my car, at the foot of Mt. Umnum, waiting for the rest of the crew to arrive, so we could begin our job of landscaping a new housing tract.  As the sun slowly began to ascend over the Hamilton range to the east, turning the sky above the still shadowy valley a bright blue, I noticed what appeared to be a morning star, or lingering planet above the fog enshrouded peak of Mt. Umnum.  As my gaze lingered upon the brightly shining object, I noticed that it appeared to be oscillating back and forth ever so slightly.   This immediately grabbed my attention, and as I now gazed intently at the object it began to grow brighter, and appeared to get larger as it continued to oscillate ever so slightly. this process continued for about 2-3 minutes until the brightly shining object descended to the same altitude as the fog enshrouded radar station, and hovered there, still visible, about a half mile away from the station.  It hovered in this position for about 5 to 10 seconds, at which point it changed direction and headed directly for the radar station.  As it entered the fog bank, it literally burned a hole in the mist.  This hole lasted for several seconds before finally converging in on itself. This sighting leads me to believe that this particular fireball may have been of U.S. military origin, as the radar station was supposed to have a landing strip in it's proximity. The radar station has since been decommissioned.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

The trail was like you would see from fireworks - bright, with very definite glowing sparkles trailing behind - not a flame like trail. My wife and I saw it straight in front of us (facing south), at an elevation of about 30 degrees. It moved left ro right. I would describe the left to right movement as going from 12:00 (straight ahead) to 11:00 in 8 seconds or so.

Very bright cobalt blue fireball over highway 101 near Minetta San Jose Airport;2005-01-17 05:30:00;10 seconds;Very bright cobalt blue fireball over highway 101 near Minetta San Jose Airport January, 2005 at approximately 05:30 AM   Very Bright Cobalt Blue Light   I was southbound on Highway 101 near Minetta San Jose Airport when I saw a very bright, cobalt blue light in the sky.  At first I thought it was a missile (I’ve never seen a missile) and that it was headed for the airport.   I was afraid, and so pulled the car over to the side of the road.  The bright light suddenly leveled out, stopped and made a sharp turn to the left and disappeared.   Its movement was definitely purposeful, it was not a meteor (I have seen many falling stars) nor was it a plane.   Airplanes don’t travel at that speed, nor do they suddenly stop and make abrupt turns in mid air.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

red/gray fireball in San Jose, Ca  1/12/11;2011-01-12 08:52:00;90 seconds;red/gray fireball in San Jose, Ca  1/12/11 Location: San Jose, CA  Evergreen Time: 08:52am Weather:  Clear skies Object: red/gray orb Angle from horizon: Approx. 60-70 deg. Flight path:  Approx: East to West with a slight arc upwards at the end. I observed  red fireball in the sky, that changed size and brightness.  It appeared to “flare up” to a bright reddish ball about twice the size of Jupiter, then would lose luminosity  and size to become a dull red color and about the size of Jupiter.  Even more interesting it would shrink down to about half the size of Jupiter, turn  a dull gray color, and looked almost oval.  It repeated this pattern several times before slightly arching upwards, then it sort of faded out of sight  in approx. 10 sec.   The entire sighting lasted  90 sec.  My mother observed this as well but didn’t want to report this herself  (sorry Mr. davenport).  What appered to be a Southwest passenger jet was in the air at this time.  My phone camera could not pick up the object. I am a father of two kids, a homeowner, and a logical person.  I have no reason to lie, and only reporting this because I’ve seen these fireballs about 15 times through the summer of 2010.  I just want to know what they are. I doubt I will find out though.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

I reported the following incident via your hotline:  On Friday, April 29, 2011 at 8:45 pm, my husband and I both witnessed 15-20 glowing orange objects in the sky over our house in San Jose, Ca.  The objects were clustered together at first, then separated randomly.  They were visible for about 5-10 minutes. They travelled in a southeast direction. From the ground and at night, it was impossible to tell the altitude, speed, or size of the objects.  It was like watching airplanes in the sky at night. Winds were 28-30 mph, out of the north.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Either a ground or sea vessel based launch of missiles viewed from a substantial distance.;2012-05-13 21:45:00;10 min;Either a ground or sea vessel based launch of missiles viewed from a substantial distance. In the Northwestern sky, I saw what I thought was an aircraft coming over the horizon.  Based upon the location, I assumed it was military as the coloration was different and appeared in the same vicinity from my vantage point as Moffett Field in Mountain View, California. Upon assent, it was apparent that the object was a missile of sorts as it had a distinct amber trail.  As it climbed in elevation, the relative perceived speed provided a clue the object was much further away that originally thought. It appear to reach the upper atmosphere and the object's propulsion begin to lighten in intensity and then disappear.  I then asked two family members to witness the remaining two launches.  I believe this was probably launched from a vessel at sea given the distance. It appears the path was due South from a launch point somewhere near the Farallon Islands. I don't believe this was extra terrestrial, just some sort of military testing however I can't believe I would have been the only one seeing this as there was plenty of commercial and private aircraft traffic airborne at the time. Now at least there is one documented sighting.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

I look to make sure it was recording, my phone showed that it was.  As I am recording I look at my phone screen and notice the there are two more smaller orange/red orbs that could not be seen with the naked eye.  All three obs formed a triangle together.  They were floating there was no noticeable movement.  My friend pulled up so I stopped recording.

I didn't see a tail or hear any noise as the object appeared to be at least a few miles away over southbound Hwy 101 toward Morgan Hill.  I knew that night was the peak night for the Perseid meteor shower, but those were supposed to be in the northwest sky, and I saw several of those early the next morning and they didn't look like that.

I was with my father in a mall parking lot when I noticed a couple pointing at the sky. that's when I saw a cluster of reddish-orange lights in the sky, about six, they were flying around each other forming different shapes in the sky and then some would randomly start to fade and disappear in the night sky. While these lights were gathering other lights started to come fly over from another location and join this group of lights.  They all flew over from the same location and joined in the same location. This occurred until all the lights had faded into the sky. We saw at least 20 lights, if not more. They were pretty high up in the sky and didn't resemble any kind of aircraft we've seen.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
3 fireball objects in San Jose/Campbell;2012-09-27 20:00:00;3 minutes;3 fireball objects in San Jose/Campbell 3 fireball objects seen in a floating pattern just past the downtown Campbell/San Jose border. Was driving home from a store and noticed the three distinct objects upon looking up at the sky while stopped at an intersection.  It was immediately obvious that they were not aircraft as they seemed to hang up in the air, and the red/orange glow they gave off was very bright and luminous, making their distance close enough to rule out any stars. They hung in the air and upon closer inspection I could see them moving across the sky in a relatively equidistant triangular pattern.   After about three minutes they seemed to get very far away or dim quickly (it was hard to tell) and winked out. This is driving me crazy because I am skeptical about these things and my first instinct was that these were some type of weather balloons or chinese lanterns due to the appearance of them floating and being a fire-y red/orange but there was something very strange about them that I couldn't put my finger on that made me continue to watch until they disappeared.  Anyways, I'm just very curious to see when the new batch of reports come out if anyone in my area saw these as well!

I was walking down the slope from our house (suburban, well lit area) when my daughter started chasing after me.   I turned around to stop her from reaching the street, and I immediately noticed two bright orange lights above the foothills that rise behind the neighborhood.  They were moving slowly west, silently, one slightly behind the other.   The trailing light broke off and made a tight, slow  U-turn and disappeared, while the other stayed, continuing to drift west for a good minute before fading from view.

Orange red fireball seen 4 times above San Jose, Ca.  8/3/13;2013-08-03 23:30:00;30 minutes;Orange red fireball seen 4 times above San Jose, Ca.  8/3/13 8/4/13--  I was sitting in my back yard last night with 2 friends discussing a upcoming vacation.   It was about 11:30pm pst.   I was facing directly East,  and was looking up at the stars ( because normally you can't see them...). It was slightly cloudy,  kind of hazy out and in the mid 60's.   The eastern sky was the only area of the sky that had visible stars.   At some point around 11:30ish I noticed a bright orangish red ball flying above the the hills,  right above Mt. Hamilton.   I stared at it for almost a minute before I knew for sure that what I was looking at was something I could not understand.   It looked like a ball of light and it moved like an airplane at first.  I then pointed it out to my 2 friends,  and let them know that I had been staring at this and can't figure it out.  They immediately thought it was an airplane,  due to the size and speed.  But then it seemed to stop in mid air,  not to mention it wasn't really moving in a straight ! line.  So then we thought it was a helicopter.  This also was disproved by the size and speed.   I would say it was the size of a 3-4 bedroom house or slightly bigger.   So it moved toward us, and seemed pretty low, but then moved away,  then North,  then back to the West,  back North again before it looked to be moving away from us upward!  When it moved it was either really slow or extremely fast.  It shot up into space and disappeared within about 10 seconds!  This ball thing also seemed to be changing color from red to orange,  and I think I could see the colors moving all around the ball.  At a certain point I could see light radiating from the ball in all directions.  It looked like seeing a red light through a wet window,  or like how a bright star looks in the distance.   This lasted at least 2 minutes.   I was then walking around my yard going through every possible explanation,  and one of my friends was also doing this.  The 3rd friend was in denial and kept maki! ng up excuses as to what it was,  but non of them made sense a! nd I cou ld disprove all of them.   After a few minutes we sat back down and attempted to restart our conversation.  I however couldn't stop staring East.  Then, after about 2-3 minutes from the last occurrence,  I saw it again!  Except this time I saw it immediately,  as it rose above the East hills.   I started yelling for everyone to look at it,  and scared them because it made me jump up.  This time we all 3 saw it from start to finish.   The weird thing was that it took what seemed to be the same path as the 1st fire balls we saw.  A lot of discussion went on during this second one,  and all possible explanations were thrown out the door.  It was official,  what we were seeing defied all logic based on our knowledge and the available technology.   It was gone again,  after it shot off into space,  and we were all left staring up into the eastern sky wondering what the f@*k just happened.  Once again after a few minutes I spotted it again in almost the same spot.  The 3rd time we! were very big eyed and quiet just observing and inside freaking out.  After the 3rd occurrence I went inside the house and told my girlfriend to wake up and put her jacket on.  I had to have another witness, and someone to explain to me what was going on.   She came outside and we all told her what we saw.  By this time we were all climbing things to get a higher view,  and she thought we were nuts!  But just my luck it happened one last time.  The 4th time we saw it,  it seemed to get closer to us before it shot off into the horizon.  Also,  during the whole thing all of us saw several shooting stars each.  All of also can't remember ever seeing more than one shooting star ever in our lives,  from San Jose that is.   I got my 6ft. ladder out to get a better view,  thinking it would happen again.  What I saw over the top of my very tall fence,  on the very tops of the hills,  was some odd lights.  It looked like street lights but all the way on the top of the hills.  I've ! lived here 32 years,  and I consider myself a very observant p! erson. I've never in my life seen lights on top of these hills.  I pointed them out to everyone and mentioned they were not normally there.   Everyone thought they were lights from someone's house on the mountain,  but I knew there are no homes there.   No more strange balls of fire showed up so we went and sat back down.  About 5 minutes later,  I got up and climbed up my ladder again.  When I looked to the top of the mountains,  the lights we saw were gone!  Also,  today with the sun up I used my binoculars to get a good view of that area,  and there is nothing there...  I don't know what we saw.  But it wasn't an airplane,  helicopter, remotely operated device, wasn't a meteor, missile, rocket, weather balloon,  and took off into space.

At around 21:00 i looked outside my window and noticed a red circular object flying coming closer to my house.  I didn't think it was a plane because there were a number of regular planes flying nearby and they didn't look like this.  It was not blinking any lights it was plain red and it seemed to be flying closer to me.  I took a picture but it didn't turn out good.  After about a minute or two of it flying it just disappeared it was an open space so it didn't go behind a tree it was just flying and then it was gone.  I wouldn't report it otherwise but i thought it was really weird that it just vanished out of nowhere.  It did seem to look similar to a fireball.

As we were talking and facing South, several more appeared to the West and went up and over our house to the East and disappeared.   I ran inside to get my camera and the binoculars.  It was hard to tell if they were in any organized pattern.  Two of them went East and it seemed one almost caught up with the other, they moved around a bit, and then disappeared.   It was also hard to tell the shape even looking through the binoculars.   One of my pictures shows a perfectly round orb and yet they also seemed to be on fire.  As one would disappear, we'd look right (West) and others would show up.   My husband saw several more than I did.   What was odd is that they seemed close and far at the same time.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
