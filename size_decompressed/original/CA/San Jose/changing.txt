Elongated, ablong, all black object floating end-over-end and quickly accelerating out of view to S. San Jose.;2001-03-15 18:01:00;2 minutes;Elongated, ablong, all black object floating end-over-end and quickly accelerating out of view to S. San Jose. Here at work in San Jose on the 5th floor my coworker came over to my cubicle and told me to look out the window and check out this thing.  We looked out the window and nothing was there.  He hurried me to the otherside of the building and I saw what looked to be a black helium baloon slowly rising.  I told him that it was a black baloon that someone had lost.  He then said wait, just look at it.  I looked a few more seconds and realized that all of a sudden it was either much closer or it had expanded.  It was no longer a small looking baloon but an ablong egg-shaped ojbect floating end over end.  It appeared to be the size of a large van, not quite shaped like a cigar but not as round as an egg.  It was all black and possibly shiny on one side as it tumbled in the air or it was polished on all sides.  It tumbled more or less as if something in space out of control end over end.  It continued to rise and then accelerated rather fast and shortly disappeared heading south of San Jose while continuing to rise.  Within seconds it was gone.  There's absolutely no way it was a helicopter or another such aircraft.  It was positively all black, nothing protruding, and possibly changing shape.  The reason why I say possibly changing shape is because it was to me quite obvious that it was a round baloon.  Then all of a sudden it was much larger and elongated.  It either changed shape or it was extremely fast and I could see it much clearer when it came closer.  There was no sound, no lights, no windows, nothing but a shiny black object. I called the Airforce base in Sunnyvale and the local police department.  My background is Systems Administrator for a large financial company and I honestly don't believe in U.F.O's.  The person he grabbed me is an outside consultant that was working a little late on database issues on one of our servers.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
Dark gray object going straight up, changing shape as it went.;2001-07-25 20:30:00;3 min;Dark gray object going straight up, changing shape as it went. Was sitting on my deck which is on the second floor of my home.  When something caught my eye.  I said out loud what the heck is that.  My first thought was it was baloons.  I was looking to the NW.  I grabed my biculors, the object was dark grey and very long. appr. 6 from top to bottom, and 1 1/2 wide.  It was moving very slowely and going up in a spiral direction straight up.  There was no marking on the object. When it would turn 1/2 way around, I could make out a red and green ball at top and middle of object.  Then the object changed shape and looked like a plane banking and turning in a circle at which time it would go around once and turn back into the shape that is going straight up.  I thought it was a group of balloons that were different sizes.  You could only see the red and green baloons when it would turn completely half way around.  It was still going straight up.  it would make two turns and then change into a plane.  After it had changed three times I lost sight of it as it went into the clouds.  Very dark grey with no marking I could make out. It moved very slow, and moved straight up. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be quite credible.  The apparent size of the object was somewhere between the size of the sun and the size of a star.  It almost certainly was not any type of conventional aircraft.  The event occurred at 8:30 p.m. we have amended the date here.  PD));37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

During Barbecue our party observed what we thought at first to be two balloons floating high in the sky moving at a slow rate of speed North to South. Then abruptly both objects stopped. Minutes later they again began moving until they both moved into the mist of a large diffusing chemtrail. While in the chemtrail they both again stopped, hovering side by side. Through binoculars (10X) they appeared to be rotating and or changing shape. We could make out a red color that appeared to be a large part of the structure. After about 10 minutes they moved out of the chemtrail and abruptly disappeared. Someone in our party said they were having a rash of UFO reports in the San Jose area.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

It has been in the same area of the sky 3 to 7 days a week, mostly in the summer months. I appears from about 12:45 am till about 3 to 4:00 am. With the nakes eye, this object appears to be a flickering white star just over the foothills and appaers to look like all the other stars in the sky. When I look at this object with my Binoculars. This object is a very bright blue and red and white flickering object that seems to move. I have called the San Jose international airport / tower.

real ufo's;2008-04-11 11:12:00;15min;real ufo's on 4/11/08 on a clear and sunny day a friend and i were walking in the back of my grandmothers house to watch my daughter in the back yard. i set my daughter  on the ground to play and my friend looks up and notices a round white orb shaped object in the sky. as it approached above us and it started to shape shifted into a boomerang  shape.  then started  to rotate 360 every angle. i called my other friend that lived across the street on my cell phone to bring some binoculars so we can see better. with the ufo already in eye sight and now i can see even better with the binoculars. as me and my friends watch my friend decides to get a telescope at his house.  as he leaves the ufo shape shifted back into an orb, when it shape shifted  back to an orb it started to light up into a white light. a few moments after that a second orb came and and started to float next to it but this orb was red  then it also started to light up but not white like the other one, red. now two ufos lighting up, a third ufo comes and lines up. the third one was also white but i did not light up like the others. my friend comes back from looking for a telescope and the orbs float away.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
sun shines of fuselage of very large high altitude object, small stationary light visible afterwards;2009-07-01 15:00:00;3 minutes;sun shines of fuselage of very large high altitude object, small stationary light visible afterwards I was sitting outside looking to the northern sky toward Milpitas.  i saw the sun shine of off an object.  at first i thought it was a high altitude plane with the sun shining off the fuselage.  i usally see the sun flicker off the fuselage of passing commercial jetliners. this is where it gets interesting.  after i see the sun shine off of this object, the object proceeds at a stady pace to the east.  it then stops in the low horizon to the east and i all see is a small red light. the light is hard to see so i grab my binocs.  the light stays motionless for about 2 minutes in the air until it finally moves or dissapears.  i would guess the object was 60-80,000 feet and very large. possibly a football field in length. but this is just a guess.  no sound made.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
1 orb and two orbs that changed shape into moonlike objects.  ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the objects are clusters of balloons.  PD));2011-04-15 14:57:00;4 min;1 orb and two orbs that changed shape into moonlike objects Picking up my daughter from school i see a white star in the sky.   Ive been seeing these ufos for over a year now so when i saw it i knew to run to my car and get my camera(that i carry with me all the time now).   On the way to the car i spot another brighter white star below i to the right.  So im looking back and fourth between my daughter(8yrs old) and the two white orbs, when out of thin air a third red orb appears to the right of the white orbs.  They are approaching my location from the east at about the speed of a small plane, at this point im running to my car for camera.  When i get my camera they are just about overhead, the first orb i spotted is quite faint and looks like a small star at a high altitude. The other two however, to my amazement, have changed thier shape.  They appear like two small crescent moons, one bright white the other bright red, and they are slowly spinning.  The spinning motion is not constant, the spinning is fast at times then! slow at other times, going one way then the other.  Both the red and white moons are spining but independently, at this point even my daughter is kinda freaking out.  The other star like one was still slightly off to the left of the two spinning moons but kinda just floated along with them from the east to the west.  So now these things are above me and i actually can see them in my cameras view finder.  I do get 8 pictures of the two spinning moon like objects and accidently get a 2sec video. When i got the pics home and inspected them closer i was excited, although the pics don't do the sighting justice some of the detail when zoomed in i could not see with the naked eye.  After seeing the detail ive concluded that they were not only spining they were changing shape. In the pictures you will see the two spining/changing ones, but the third starlike one was there above to the left out of view.  The sighting ended with the object flying over the homes/trees that i was standi! ng next to and out of sight. The only thing i would like to ad! d was as im on the sidewalk next to my daughter,taking pictures and both of us looking up, about a dozen kids with parents also leaving the school walked by me. Almost as amazing as the ufos flying above my head was that NOT ONE person asked me what we were taking pictures of or even bothered to look up to see what i was looking at for almost 5 min. This truly disturbed me, i wanted to scream look up, but it just felt awkward so i didn't. In retrospect i wish i would have tho. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the objects are clusters of balloons.

Ghost-like orange orb was seen in Alum Rock, California, on June 4, 2014.;2014-06-04 22:40:00;3-5 minutes;ghost-like orange orb was seen in Alum Rock, California on June 4, 2014 Between the time of 10:30PM-11:05PM PST a strange ghost-like orb was sighted by me.  It was seen 310° NW in Alum Rock, California. I looked up above my neighbors house, and this ghostly orange orb was seen floating vertically at an 80° slant.  This orb can barely be seen with the naked eye, but was an obvious object that had a ghost like appearance.  It was not glowing, let's make that clear  it was a light orange color that blended into the dark sky..   As it moved it was like an upside down flame, floating ever so slightly leaving a ghost-like trail behind it..  It would stop a couple of times and would revert back to its original form a sphere.  Gazing upon it, for about 3-5 minutes, it disappeared blending into the night sky, I tried to keep motionless and staring at it, but soon it vanished without a trace.  It was an eerie heart-beating event, I've never seen anything so astonishing in my life. I also want to point out, there were many aircraft in the sky, less than a dozen had been spotted during the time of 10:30PM-11:05PM.  They could have been military, but as it was a moon lit night so I couldn't be certain.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
((HOAX??))  MASSIVE UFO SIZE OF TWO SKYSCRAPERS APPEARS!!;2015-03-12 12:25:00;60 seconds;MASSIVE UFO  SIZE OF TWO SKYSCRAPERS APPEARS!! I was on the freeway when I saw a Huge Spaceship hovering above.  It looked like it was trying to hide in the clouds, which were extremely out of the ordinary dark, but not rain clouds.  The ship popped into view suddenly and disappeared along with the dark cloud. I swear it was there!  I didn't get a chance to catch it on my phone, but my girlfriend and I both saw it.  It was the size of two skyscrapers surrounded by a massive disk like structure, with a crown like top structure.  It Resembled district 9 movie spaceship!!  The craft disappeared in a flash... getting smaller like as if a vortex had sucked it back in.  The White clouds around the object that disappeared the clouds were streaking to one point    After I pulled over I saw several small dark clouds hovering low in the atmosphere, these clouds were like nothing I've ever seen ... these clouds were traveling at an unusual rate across the cities and they started to vanish very quickly into thin air.  Within a matter of seconds they disappeared. Latter I traveled to Liver-more where i was surprised to find several of the same dark clouds scattered around town... that were dissipating just like the ones I saw in San Jose.
