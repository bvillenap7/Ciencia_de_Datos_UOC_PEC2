Lime green lozenge -shaped light shot across the sky.;1969-11-13 21:03:00;7 seconds;Lime green lozenge -shaped light shot across the sky. I was sitting on my back porch with my cat.  At a few minutes after 9pm, a lime green lozenge-shaped light appeared on my right heading toward the Santa Cruz mountains.  There was no sound and no disintegrating effect like a meteor.  The edges of the light were fuzzy.   The light shot over the mountains.  As it did, it illuminated the underside of the clouds.   I ran into my house yelling that I had seen a UFO.  I immediately telephoned Vandenberg Air Force Base to ask if they had launched anything and they said no. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Red, green and gold light amazes multiple witnesses over Santa Clara Valley;1986-10-14 20:30:00;2 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate.  One of three dramatic reports from the same source, reported since October 2002.  We do not know whether the reports are authentic.  We will contact the witness.  PD))   Red, green and gold light amazes multiple witnesses over Santa Clara Valley I was talking to several friends in the parking lot of Lynbrook High School in San Jose, Ca. when I noticed a big, bright, red light swinging back and forth like a pendulum about a few thousand feet up in the dark sky behind them. It was similar in size and brightness to a large crimson one I'd seen before on the back of a helicopter, but whatever it was made absolutely no noise whatsoever. I looked closely, but couldn't see any type or shape of an aircraft body, just the round, unblinking light. It then suddenly stopped swinging back and forth, remaining motionless for a second and then began slowly moving to the right in a straight line into a cloud bank. When it hit the clouds, the light turned to green, and then gold and then back to red again. It then disappeared into the clouds.  I called the local TV station and reported it when I got home, and asked the anchorwoman that actually answered the phone if anyone else had called in . She said 'No, you're the only one'. Another newsperson semi-jokingly reported it later on the air on the eleven o'clock news.  About a week later I saw the following article in the newspaper ( I kicked myself for not cutting it out at the time!), and then realized that there were other witnesses besides myself that had seen this object on or about the same time that I did. Mine was the Tuesday night sighting because I was taking a Tuesday-Thursday college class at the time, and we had just gotten out of class and were getting ready to leave when I spotted it. I found the article again recently listed online, so I thought I'd include it for historical reference:  Mystery Lights Return To Saratoga  By Kathy Holub  Mercury News Staff Writer  A beautiful apparition has been glowing in the night sky over Saratoga ,leaving viewers baffled and entranced. About 15 people, all agog, called Santa Clara County dispatchers on Tuesday night to report a mysterious bright red light that hovered in thesky from 8:15 to 8:30 and then disappeared.  Dozens of callers described a similar phenomenon on Oct. 16, same time, same place.It was very exciting, said ((name deleted)) of Los Gatos, who watched last week's display during a break in her real estate class at West Valley College.It was very bright, much larger than the lights you see on airplanes. At one point, something burning or flickering dropped from it. It was just a tiny little flicker that came down. We all went: `Oooh, what was that?'  No one seems to know.  That includes ((name #2 deleted)) of Saratoga, who spied the object Tuesday night while lounging with her husband in their backyard spa.Yauger said the light appeared high in the northwestern sky, first moving toward them, then away. Through her binoculars, the apparition became a cluster of lights. It was scary. When it started get- ting larger, it seemed to be coming down, she said. Yauger didn't see the object fade from view because she had just gone into the house. Her husband told her the light turned green and slowly disappeared.  Spokesmen at Moffett Field Naval Air Station said nothing flew out of their airfield Tuesday that looked like that. And officials at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc said they didn't launch a thing Tuesday night. Ditto for Oct. 15.Other watchers of the night sky - air traffic controllers and astronomers at Lick Observatory - said they saw nothing unusual.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

It looked about 1/2 the size of Mars and was flying in a short zig-zag hopping fashion from the south to the north in the eastern sky.  It seemed to be far too high for a helicopter (maybe 30,000 feet). When I went to the front yard to see if it continued in the same direction it could not be seen in any part of the sky. My back yard is on the south side of my yard. At about 22:30 I looked up toward the eastern sky.  I believe that the planet visible in that part of the sky at that time of night is the planet Mars. I noticed that the planet was slightly above and east of what seemed to be two overlapping red balls of light, one on the left and the other on the right.  The red lights were about half the size of the planet but equal to its brightness.  A bright white light kept flashing in strobe fashion from the midst of the red lights. Althought they constantly moved in a northerly direction, the lights moved from the south toward the north in short zig-zagging eastward and westward  hops. I watched for about a half minute before entering my house and going to the front yard to see if the lights were continuing in the same direction. When I reached the front yard on the north side of my house I could not find the lights in any part of the sky.  Thinking that something could be obstruc- ting my view, I walked fifty feet to the west and fifty feet to the east of my house for a different perspective.  I was still unable to find a sign of the lights in any direction or at any distance.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

Odd color. hello, i live in San Jose, Ca. back in march 2000, i saw something in the sky that was different from anything i've ever seen. it was night time and i was on a regularly busy freeway, Highway 101. i didn't catch it at first because it looked like a glare on my windshield. but i started to notice that it didn't move. it looked like a light blue, squarish streak. like thrust or something but in the shape of a parallelogram.  it's like taking a light blue hi-liter and positioning the tip at 2 o'clock, then draw a short straight line.  it wasn't thin like a shooting star, a bit more thicker.  it was stationary and solid in color. when it finally did move, it was slow, but then moved like a meteor/shooting star at a high speed horizontally accross the sky from left to right on my point of view. after it acclerated, it disappeared. it was very hard to tell if the distance was within our atmosphere, or something in space.  but it was definitely there.  i heard from friends that there is a missle test sight in the area.  but all my 20years of living here, i've never heard of one.  i was suprised that it wasn't on the news or anything, because it was around 8pm or 8:30pm and there were plenty of people on the freeway.  and plus there were at least 4 aircraft/airliners in the area during the time.  i don't have any pictures because i was driving, but i remember it well.  i clearly saw it.  it might've been a meteor, but what makes me question it is the shape of it.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

The color and glow of the lights were odd.I watched them thinking they were just planes. but the longer I watched the stanger they seemed.  They didn't seem to move in a constant path and the light were red and orange but not like any plane light I have ever seen.  They seemed to disappear only to reappear in a different spot.  I was trying to figure out what the hell they were. as we traveled farther down about ten min I saw another light to the west and then I really started trippin, at the same time my friend mentioned that she to had seen the strange lights up the road but didn,t say anything as well.  We then saw another to the east and noticed the car next to us pointing to the sky as if they to were seeing the same thing. the first thing that came to mind because of the recent world events was that they were military crafts or that we were being invaded I know it sounds funny but they were that strange, and my friend and I are MAJOR skeptics I really got scared because it seemed 2 more were coming from the east. They had some strange red cross like lights on the bottom not all of them but at least 3. We were traveling and could no longer see them but as we reached salinas about 7 or 8 miles down or more I saw another to the east which then disappeared and then reappeared to the west of me and it had the strange red lights to. I don't know what they were but they were very strange and scared me to death I'm very curious to know if anyone else witnessed these strange lights? ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Orange star like object observed in nighttime San Jose sky;2002-11-11 20:08:00;1 minute;Orange star like object observed in nighttime San Jose sky My friend and I were just leaving the post office at Camden and Ross Aves. in my pickup when I saw an orange star like object moving slowly beneath the moon. I asked my friend, Do you see that? He replied, Yes!. I stopped the truck in the parking lot and we both quickly got out for a better look. It was an orange, flame colored, star like object that was moving slowly east. Slower than a plane, it all of a sudden seemed to just disappear - maybe possibly into the nighttime clouds or haze behind it, and then I briefly saw it dimly flare again, and then it seemed to be totally gone. We observed other, more traditional aircraft in the sky over the next few minutes and none of the operating beacons or landing lights had this same strange orange color that the object we first observed did.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Red and it looked like it shot straight out - towards space.;2003-10-09 20:15:00;1 minutes;Red and it looked like it shot straight out - towards space. We were walking the dogs tonight (about 8:15 p.m.) out in a baseball field - we live in the San Francisco Bay Area (near San Jose, California) when we stopped to watch what we thought was a satellite.  We watched for about a minute as it kept a straight course.  I looked down to step forward and when I looked back up my eyes focused on a rather bright star - next to where the satellite had just passed.  My partner did not stop looking up.  As my eyes found the satellite, we both saw it turn red and it looked like it shot straight out - towards space, then disappeared.  It happened really fast, like, a second or two.   We watched the sky for another couple of minutes – thinking it would reappear – but it did not.  Planes come by our way frequently as we are almost beneath the flight path for Ames Research/Moffett Field.  Shortly (within about 30 seconds) after the satellite disappeared there was one such flight coming into Moffett.  I don’t know if this came from the Moffett plane, but a contrail floated across the sky – visible to our eyes – roughly in the same path that the satellite had been going (we think it strange but probably not connected).  Perhaps it was the exhaust from the Moffett plane.  Perhaps you will have others reporting about this in the Bay Area and we aren’t the only ones who saw this.

As I look to my right, south, i saw a bright triangular actually,  wedge shaped light flying through the sky very fast.One solid light. It looked very much like a shooting star because it was flying perfectly straight and appeared to fly towards the ground as a shooting star would. Except I noticed it was very low and had to have been in our atmosphere because we saw it continue until the tree blocked our view except where there were spots through the trees where we could still notice that it was flying  fast and  low southbound, and made no noise, did not leave any trail,. Very strange and suprising. She said maybe it was from moffet field, but i dont know.

Light traveling at very high rate of speed across the morning sky.;2004-10-11 05:00:00;12-15seconds;Light traveling at very high rate of speed across the morning sky. The early morning sky was crystal clear.  No clouds or ceiling present.  A light moving at an extremely high rate of speed entered my field of vision from the north- west quadrant of the sky.  It continued at a rapid pace at an even altitude for approximately 12 to 15 seconds before it left my field of vision as it headed in a southerly direction.  My first impression was that it was a shooting star.  However, I am perplexed as I have seen many shooting stars before and they have never been that clear nor have been flying in such an even pattern.  There was no discernable noise and the luminosity of the object was in fact very similar to the brightness of the stars in the morning sky.

Because of the cloud, the estimated distance was about 2 miles out and about 1500 ft. high. The area that this was observed is about 5 miles from the NASA-Ames research center at Moffit Field.

The top light got brighter and changed colors to an amber red for second. These lights were seen west of San Jose, towards the Pennisula and the Bay. We see many planes and helicopters in this area so we know how they appear in the sky these lights were much more brilliant - both were as bright as a rising Venus at certain times of the year. I could not detect any sound. As they dropped below our sight, they kept the same vertical alignment, same distance apart, and moved at the same rate of speech.

Small white dot high in sky similar to 7/2009 case over San Jose.;2010-08-05 15:00:00;5 minutes;Small white dot high in sky similar to 7/2009 case over San Jose. Similar to 7/1/2010 case over San Jose. Small white dot appears over San Jose.  Observed from South San Jose.  The dot was quite small but clearly visible with the eye .  Binocs didn’t help much.  I think the dot disappeared after about 5 minutes.  Too high to be a plane.  Space station moves and this was stationary.  The angle was looking almost at 60 degrees in the sky from my position to the north. Could it have been a star visible during the day time? If so, why would it disappear after five minutes.

2 High Altitude Craft over San Jose, CA.;2011-08-18 22:15:00;30 seconds;2 High Altitude Craft over San Jose, CA. 2 Lights flying very high altitude, similar to the eye as satellite movement, but with 2 distinct craft. I had a near full horizon view from south to north to view the lights.  The 2 lights were flying south to north approximately.  No blinking lights were visible and no sound of audible, only solid white lights of similar brightness of a satellite or medium bright star.   At approximately 10 seconds into the sighting, the lead craft accelerated and separated at a high rate of speed.  The trailing craft light became less visible then invisible to the eye at about 15-20 seconds into the sighting, the lead craft which had accelerated away was visible until it disappeared into the horizon.  Judging from the angle, I would have to guess the craft were flying at 60,000 - 70,000 feet.    The amount of time to cross the entire horizon from first sighting was roughly 35 seconds maximum.   Could they have been fighter aircraft?  Possibly, but are fighter aircraft emitting solid white light at high altitude flight?

The lights were moving in a straight line almost like cars then began shaping into what appeared to be buildings, meaning they looked like long horizontal rectangles.   Then the lights started to scatter around, then start to go into a V formation which started flying over to our direction and it was HUGE!  Once it got just about over the car to the right it totally disappeared. There was plenty of traffic so im sure the cars around us noticed it as well. there were so many lights moving around and once it took on that V formation theres no way anyone could miss it, even if they werent looking up it was that big.   Hopefully more people can make a report to verify what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a time for the sighting, so we have assigned an arbitrary time above.

They were 2 to 3 times the size of the reference stars visible that evening, and about twice as bright, coloring in, like stars, white/blue.  The 3 lights were moving independent of each other, though retaining a general left-to-right margin distance of approximately 3 1/2 to 4 inches thumb-to-finger distance at arms length (I’m 5’10 1/2”).  Each light &quotmoved quickly”, which is to say that within this margin, these lights traveled the full distance in slightly-curved lines with tight, elevated/declined curves at the margins in about 1/2 second.  They did this sporadically about 5 times within the 30 seconds.  When not “moving quickly”, they seemed to stay still, though there was some “drifting away” in what appeared to be the same south by southeast direction. After witnessing this event, I rushed into the house to get the kids and the camera by the time I returned (1 to 1-1/2 minutes later), the thick-blanket cloud cover moving in from the southwest had obscured the lights;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

Helicopter pursues/escorts ufo.;2013-12-23 17:50:00;1 minute;Helicopter pursues/escorts ufo A helicopter was hovering over a 1 mile radius for approximately 25 minutes. After that time I suddenly noticed a white light hovering closely to the helicopter that was not present minutes before.  The helicopter immediately followed the solid light about five miles into the distance.  The white light was not visible after the helicopter traveled 3 or so miles alongside away from my ground position.  Then the helicopter returned and left. The white light was easily distinguishable from the helicopter and hovered closely.  This caught my eye being there were no running or hazard lights on the vehicle the helicopter was running aside and appeared to be persuing.  It largely appeared the helicopter was present for another reason and happened to come across this vehicle.  It appeared to either be a police or traffic monitoring helicopter and then changed its course once the light appeared.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
White point of light.;2013-12-25 16:30:00;~5 minutes;White point of light My brother and I were outside in front of our house on Christmas day.  He noticed what he described as a star, but with the sun still out I told him it was probably Jupiter.  I ran into the house quickly for about a minute and then came back out.  He was still fixated on this object, so I looked up and found it difficult to locate.  When I did see it, I noticed a small, rather unremarkable point of light just lingering there so I thought nothing of it.  It was almost directly overhead, the light was constant, and the weather was clear. After another minute or perhaps less, my brother said it was moving so he ran to grab his binoculars.  I found it harder to locate this time as indeed it had changed its location.  It was moving approximately ENE across the sky, but not particularly quickly, more like drifting across.  Now I knew it wasn't Jupiter so I went to grab my spyglass.  I asked him if it might be the ISS or a satellite but he said no as he was looking through his binoculars.  He couldn't make out the actual details of the object as it was difficult to focus on it with cheap binoculars, much less the fact that it was drifting across the sky.  It appeared to be slowly drifting faster until it was no longer there!  It was still overhead at the moment of last sighting and then we couldn't locate it any more. I'm not sure what this could be, and I'm pretty sure there's an explanation.  I'm sort of a skeptic when it comes to UFO sightings but am open to the idea of government/military experiments or atmospheric phenomena as explanations for most of them.  For this particular sighting, neither of those make sense to me.  If anyone has more information, I'd love to know.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

As planes do use that corridor fairly regularly, I paused to watch as it was very bright.  There were no flashing lights or sounds of an aircraft.  It appeared that there were two white lights in close proximity to each other, such as would be found on an airliner.  The object moved somewhat slowly and I guessed it was about 4-6 miles away.  After about 20 seconds, what looked like a spotlight from the object aimed at an approx. 200º down and to my left.  I then thought that it must be SJPD’s helicopter.  The “spotlight” continued for about 30 seconds and I wonder why it remained in the clouds/fog instead of dropping to get a clearer view of the subject.  It was not a helicopter as far as I could tell.  I then looked around the sky and realized there were no other clouds or any fog.! The “spotlight” was in fact a trail of smoke/vapor, etc., and it was about 20º long and continued into a much larger marshmallow-shaped cloud.  I could still see the light as it continued on and seemed to curve slightly upward to the west and away from me before disappearing.  The event lasted about 2 minutes.  The “spotlight” part of the cloud remained for about 15 minutes, glowing bluish-white.  The moving light itself faded after about 7 minutes.  The cloud formation stretched about 60º across the sky.

My son originally spotted the object. My wife got a couple of good photos. The object appeared to e emit a cone-shaped plume of white illuminated material. There also appeared to be a lingering green beam of light behind the object. The green beam appeared to be about as wide as the full moon and very straight and consistent in its pale green color. The green beam persisted for several minutes and appeared to stretch toward the horizon behind the object. The white plume appeared to be illuminated and appeared to grow as the object proceeded toward the west/northwest in a straight line. After watching the objects and plume for more about a minute the plume suddenly cut off and the object continued to move ahead in a straight line. The plume expanded behind the object and appeared to be approximately 5+ degrees in width. One other witness and I continued to watch the object move toward the western horizon. After approximately 4 minutes the object appeared to brighten and become stationary. As we continued to watch, the object appeared to change directions, turning about 90 degrees to the left heading toward the southwest. iPhone photos will be submitted via email. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S.

The white light shining down went out from the point of light at an angle towards the ground and it expanded out in a very distinct come shape that had very clear edges to it. In the center of the cone of white light was a green stripe of light that glowed like radium and nearly the same color. The point of light emitted no sound and was traveling upwards from the earth. The cone of light itself began to come apart like a fog. The point of light was going higher and higher and made a turn to the west northwest.

At around 2:30 am 04/01/2016, I looked up in the sky because I thought I heard a plane. When I spotted this thing I knew it was not a plane I am the manager at the apartments I live at and have access to all the lighting so I went around and shut off all the lights on the grounds to see this thing better when I looked up it had barely moved.  Then I flipped it off and began flashing my led flashlight at it thinking it was a drone that the county uses.   At around 3 am a tenant came and asked what is going on I told him and he grabbed a pair of binoculars remembering that I had a pair too I did the same  He said he had seen this before, and it was a satellite.  When looking at it through the lenses it moved up and down and side to side quickly it was hard to keep it in the lenses when looking at it with the naked eye it just seems to hover in one place when I told this guy that he laughed and said yea they are a trip and he left.   Well, I just looked out my front door and it is still there at 4:36 am pst it is not saucer shape it is more oblong when looking at it through the lenses it changes it is a ball of fire then just a light that seems to have two parts at times.  Anyway, I'm off to see if I can get more people to see it so there is better proof if you need it.  I called the news room at ktvu and have not heard anything so maybe its nothing.  Oh, I got four other people to look they said it was unusual too.  thank you;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

But then a few moments later it comes back on in the same exact spot . All the while other lights are fading on and off much dimmer around the object , I'm thinking they were more far away but these lights were actually moving then would stop move some more stop fade in fade out .

I tried to see where they were coming from but there seemed to be no trail.  I called my folks to come out and take a look and they to saw what I saw.  It almost looked like they were dropping out of the sky.  They were very high, too high to be planes.  They seemed to be traveling at a fast pace.  I counted twenty in all.  After about 25 minutes it stopped.  I went in the house and returned outside about five minutes later and saw two more disappear across the sky.  The sky is dark tonight with no moon .;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656

A single line of 25 flying light objects flying moving faster than a satellite;2020-12-02 18:00:00;1 minute;A single line of 25 flying light objects flying moving faster than a satellite I live in San Jose, California and today is December 2, 2020. I went outside of backyard thinking that I have not seen a satellite in months.  I was watching at the sky around 6:00 pm (was already dark) and few minutes later  I started seeing 3 or 4 satellite going in different directions. After minutes not seeing a satellite I started seeing a row of 3 or 4 flying light objects in a single file and I was surprised that more flying objects light were traveling from West to East.  I was thinking that I was feeling dizzy but I was not and started counting 6, 7, 8, 9 and I was standing 4 feet from our bedroom windows and was thinking to call my wife to come outside but I felt like frozen and I was not able to talk.  Finally I counted 22 flying objects lights but I know I missed I least 3 more flying objects lights that flew from west to east across my house up here. They were in a single file and going really fast. And the last flying object followed at a different distance that the others. I know those flying light objects were not satellites because these objects were moving fasters compared to the satellite.  Unfortunately I only had my cell phone that was not going to be able to capture the event.;37.3279713771828;-121.882327209656
