Last night at around midnight I saw it outside my window.  It scared the bejesus out of me, and I walked to my room and put the covers over my head.  I'm so disappointed in myself.  I wish I would have gone out to investigate.  It was BRIGHT orange and it lit up the sky as it traveled.  First I saw it behind the trees and then it ascended upward over the roof of my house so I couldnt see it anymore.  I got a cold chill looking at it.  I'm such a wuss!;35.5419;-120.7128
