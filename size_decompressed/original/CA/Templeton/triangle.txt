Buzzing triangle aircraft.;2014-12-26 00:00:00;5 minutes;Buzzing triangle aircraft. Standing outside in the afternoon when I heard a buzzing.  I work at a military base and know what the electric UNmanned aerial vehicles sound like- a high pitched buzzing.   Saw the triangle craft fly low  and slowly overhead maybe under 500 feet altitude.  Flew slowly along well established flight line from east to west.  It was a rounded edged triangles the same shape as the TR-3B (Google it), though without the central light.   What I saw looked like a small duty aircraft in similar shape as the Boeing X-48- it even sounded similar thought it's underbelly was white and grey.  It had lights like a normal aircraft.   Everyone thinks I'm crazy but I know what I saw.  Perhaps it was an RC remote controlled craft.  Please post of you saw something similar in the vicinity.   My dog was out with me but had no abnormal response.  Thank you;35.5419;-120.7128
