White funnel shape light with giant blueish white tail and bright white head!  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.

PD)) It’s 6pm Saturday November 7, 2015 in rural Templeton, CA.  I arrived home and stopped at the bottom of my driveway to manually put my truck in 4 wheel drive so I can drive up to the house without spinning my tires on the dirt driveway.  Just as I locked the hubs on my front wheels I noticed a very bright light above the home across the road from me. It looked like a huge comet with a large blueish tail and a huge funnel shape fan head with a bright light at the apex.  It was traveling from the southeast toward the west.  The widest side of the funnel took up about 20 degrees of sky which was as wide as my hand held at arm’s length with fingers up.  It was traveling parallel to the horizon.  By the time I reached the top of the driveway and called my wife to come and look, the lights had faded and the bright point of light in front had vanished, however the tail was still glowing blueish white but seemed out of focus and was fading away.  The entire incident took about 10 minutes and the tail remained for about another 5 or so. I’ve never seen anything like it. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));35.5419;-120.7128
