One very fast, very low flying rectangular object changes direction, stops, then seperates into three equally fast smaller objects.;1997-10-15 17:30:00;6-8 seconds.;One very fast, very low flying rectangular object changes direction, stops, then seperates into three equally fast smaller objects. It was very still and quiet that late afternoon after several windy days. First, I heard a low, muffled buzzing sound to my left. When I turned to see what was causing it, I saw a roughly rectangular object moving very fast in a ENE direction. When the object reached the south end and east side of a local hill, it abruptly changed direction, now heading NNW. After about 3 miles it stopped, without slowing, for about 2 to 3 seconds. Then it seperated into 3 smaller objects which headed ENE for about 8 miles. All 3 objects then abruptly turned NNE before becoming too small to see. The 3 objects were evenly spaced as they moved, and the objects were about 400 to 500 ft in altitude. All were a dark charcoal in color with no visible lights. The 3 seperated objects seemed to leave a very brief streak in the lower atmosphere. There is more to this report that does not fit into the criteria set forth for the report. Please contact me if you can. I'd like to know the truth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));34.8684;-116.8847
