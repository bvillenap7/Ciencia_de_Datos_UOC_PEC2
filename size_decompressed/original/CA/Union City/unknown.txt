Object enter triangular light, then light pinch shut.;2003-01-08 22:00:00;2 minutes;Object enter triangular light, then light pinch shut. I was walking west on Alvarado-Niles Road in Union City, Ca  94587. Just past H Street walked into a darken area and looked up at about 1:30 postion looking SSW at a rough estimate height of about 30,000 feet. Weather condition was cool crisp air with cloudy sky with patches of clear area. Heard nothing unusual, but saw a large solid whitish-yellow triangular light that seems to be origninating from the left side.  Then there is a dark gap, then the light is seen reflecting off a small cloud bank. As I watch the light is motionless for approximately a minute, then I see a tiny dark object enter the triangular light and head toward the left vertex of the triangular light.  After the object reached the left vertex the triangular light closes up in a pinching fashion. Could not see any object in the left vertex of the triangular light. Could not see any objects at the approximately 30,000 feet altitude after the triangular light pinch shut. There were a couple of aircraft flying around heading in a westerly direction, but they were really low compare to where the triangular light was.;37.5889999999999;-122.0461
Unknown Aircraft Hoovers in Silence;2009-11-22 18:45:00;10 - 15 mins;Unknown Aircraft Hoovers in Silence Sunday, November 22, 2009 I was driving home from the grocery store.  I was headed East on Decoto Road at around 6:45pm when I noticed a flying aircraft of some sort traveling South parallel to Mission Blvd, right above the hills.  I noticed one red light, one teal looking light and one white light.  Naturally I thought it was a commercial airline until it made a very quick right turn going west.  That is what caught my attention right away.  I came to a red traffic light and continued to watch the aircraft fly west to the right of me.   As it got closer I noticed it switched angles and I could now see only three vertical, round red lights blinking in a sequence.  Then not a moment later the aircraft came to a complete stop in mid air and hovered in the same spot.  I honked my horn to get the driver next to me to look up and see what I was seeing, but they just drove off.  The traffic light had now turned green, so I pulled my car over to the side of the road and got! out.  I stood and watched this aircraft hover for about a minute or two. I noticed that I could not hear any sort of noise coming from this aircraft either.  I think it might have been about 2 or 3 football fields in the air.  It defiantly seemed noticeably close.  The aircraft then started to move again and it continued west until I could not see it anymore.;37.5889999999999;-122.0461
Very large meteor or something on fire over San Francisco Bay.;2012-10-17 19:45:00;3 seconds;Very large Meteor or something on fire over San Francisco Bay. At 7:45 PM on Oct 17 2012,  I sighted what looked like a very large meteor in the western Sky I sighted it in Union City CA ( the east side of the San Francisco bay).   At first I thought it might be a firework but it was too high and too far away.  I have seen Meteor showers before in the mountains but this was far bigger It looked like I thought a comet would with a tail that went about two degrees long from where I was standing.  It was about 35 degrees up from where I was standing.  It was going from my left to right or South to North as I was facing West.  It was angling slightly downward then broke up into 3 pieces, all on fire, and began more of a arch going down then they burnt out.  This lasted about 3 seconds.  It may have been longer but I just saw it as I got out of my car and did not see when it started.  I hope it was not a airplane going down into the SF bay. Union city is in a flight path for the Oakland, Hayward and San Francisco Airport, I can always see at least 4 or 5 planes somewhere in the air and would be surprised if one of them didnâ€™t see it.;37.5889999999999;-122.0461
