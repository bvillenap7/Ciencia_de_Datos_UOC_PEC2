My husband and I were looking at Venus through the telescope when I noticed what at first looked like other stars in the sky which I quickly realized were definately not stars because they were girating and disappearing and reappearing at a different spot in the sky. As these ships would rotate they appeared to change shape from disk shaped to almost like that of a eagle. There was flashing lights on these objects and what appeared to be beams of light being shot down from them. Where we live being that we are near 3 major airports there is generally tons of commercial air traffic at all times of the day directly overhead, however the commercial air traffic was obviously being rerouted to accomidate these visitors. The ultimate confirmation though was that there were military planes circling the area we saw at least 4. Our friend that was over visiting was really tripping because it was his first time seeing a ufo. This was just the most recent sighting at this location for my husband and I. Prior to living at our current residence I had never seen a ufo, but our 1st night here 5/20/01 I was awakened to the reality that we are not alone. We have seen ufo's many times since that night here,it appears to be a hotbed. Really it makes perfect sense since here in the extremely populated Bay Area there is so much light distortion and air activity they could conduct whatever business they have without hardly ever being noticed by the general public. We most definately noticed though and if granted the privelage in the future we will continue to notice as often as possible. ,;37.5889999999999;-122.0461
