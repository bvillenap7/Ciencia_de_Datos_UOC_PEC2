I witnessed two amber glowing lights opposed on each side with no structure slowly crossing the southern sky about 600 feet from my sight.  I was standing in my backyard on a clear Oct. night and heard no sound from the sight I watched.  The vehicle crossed above me and disappeared when it went behind a large pine tree in my neighbor's yard.;37.5889999999999;-122.0461
