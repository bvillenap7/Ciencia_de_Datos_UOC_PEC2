The object I saw was at first almost like a airship as it had 2 bright lights that seemed to be following close behind but spaced apart. Then the light in the middle seemed to have been shaped as a can like shape really although stubby it had a flat top at one point but it seemed that the light was off for a few minutes and then kind of flickered almost as if their were problems with it but as a few minutes passed the middle bright light was back on and remained on as I was video taping a segment that was 15 min long. As this was taking place the object in the middle was moving quite rapidly and then had seemed to at one point stand still as if it was looking at me as well. (a little creepy to say the least!) the colors were mostly a orange hue or red hue but not much more than that as the 3 white lights were really what stood out and that's what got me to look up and wonder what the heck... I was outside in the front of my house at 4 am EXACTLY as I couldn't sleep for some reason so I stepped out to have a cigarette and as I was lighting it I just glanced up and noticed these 3 bright lights that seemed to be either attached to eachother or following eachother in perfect formation. I always take my cell with me even for a smoke as once I was locked out and as I say ONCE I was! So O got my cell out and turned it on to take a video of what caught my attention. This was a little exciting;37.7586269230769;-121.934136538462
My kids and I just saw this exact same craft depicted in link below pass over us while playing outside.  ((anonymous report));2018-09-10 18:50:00;1-2 minutes;My kids and I just saw this exact same craft depicted in link below pass over us while playing outside.  It was as big or bigger than airliner.. no wings... no sound... clear as day... moving fast... not blimp speed... no visible means of propulsion... tried to get my phone cam out but had left inside. http://lightsinthetexassky.blogspot.com/2010/07/navy-veteran-witnesses-cylinder-shaped.html   We saw another higher flying airliner a few minutes later and although about twice the altitude could see its wings clear as day.

I was sitting at a traffic light heading back to work. This was in broad daylight during lunchtime.  I just happened to look up through my front windshield when I noticed a silver, metallic, cylindrical object that seemed to be spiraling towards the earth.  There were no wings, protrusions or sound coming from this object. I thought that it would have to crash and make a large boom, but it continued to spiral down and went behind the tree line where I could no longer see it.  I never heard any booms or saw any indications of a crash.  I checked the news and other sources of media to see if anyone else reported it, but no such luck.;37.7586269230769;-121.934136538462
