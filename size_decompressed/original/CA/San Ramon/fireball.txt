The object I witnessed moved just like a shooting star except it was bigger and looked like a fire ball. The object was glowing white light for the few seconds I saw it. It flew above and in front of my car. The object sped Northwest. The other person that saw this object was my mother.;37.7586269230769;-121.934136538462
