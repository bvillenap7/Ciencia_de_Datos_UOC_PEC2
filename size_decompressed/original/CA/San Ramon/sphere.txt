Sphere with red white green flashing lights;2012-08-08 00:05:00; 20 minutes (ongoing);Sphere with red white green flashing lights As I lay in bed looking out the window a flashing light caught my eye.  I went outside to get a closer look and the sphere was alternating between white/green/red light in random order. Occasionally the light would spread out into a number of lights in a row.  This happened sometimes vertically sometimes horizontally.  I estimate it was located north west of san ramon about 10-15miles away.;37.7586269230769;-121.934136538462
