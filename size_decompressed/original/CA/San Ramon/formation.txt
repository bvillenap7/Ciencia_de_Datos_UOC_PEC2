Hello, I live in San Ramon California 94582.  The sighting was at 7:38PM Pacific Time on November 25th 2012 I was looking at an approximate 45 Degree angle just under the Moon at 126 Degrees South East. I noticed a very bright group of spheres in a offset Triangular pattern moved from 126 Degrees SE to 86 Degrees E in a matter of 3 seconds.  They were totally silent. I could not get my iPhone video recorder up fast enough before they disappeared entirely from sight at 86 Degrees East.  My exact coordinates are 37 Degrees 46’ 31” N, 121 Degrees 56’ 56” W.  I would really like to know if anyone else saw this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.7586269230769;-121.934136538462
