Point of light with faint, wispy weather-balloon-shaped feature protruding from its side.  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket.  PD));2016-02-10 05:20:00;45 seconds;Point of light with faint, wispy weather-balloon-shaped feature protruding from its side. It was a point of light travelling slowly westward from about 5 deg west of Polaris, with a faint, comet-like tail protruding sideways toward the north.  The end of the tail seemed to end in a roughly spherical cloud.  It traveled westward for about 45 seconds where I lost sight of about 15 deg above a relatively brighter horizon.  The fuzzy teardrop-shaped feature was large - about three times the diameter of a full moon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
