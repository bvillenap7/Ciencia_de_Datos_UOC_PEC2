It sat like a star for a few moments, then quickly darted back and forth, north and south, then suddenly darted off to the west so quickly I lost sight of it. There was no sound.;37.7586269230769;-121.934136538462

This was a clear-blue sky with only a few small clouds visible.  I was sitting in our home talking to my wife, looking outside when I saw a flat object moving in a west-bound direction, SW of our location. The object was a bright blue color and am not sure if the color was from the object or a rereflection off of the object. It remained at a steady speed and came to an abrupt stop positioned between two clouds (they seemed to be two only two in the sky, making it easy to reference where to tell my wife to look...)  As it hovered, I told my wife to look, and we both sat and stared for a while. The object dipped both up and down. The color of the object then started to fade in and out, with the object still slightly visible as it shifted angles. This shifting activity went on for about 10 seconds and then it just vanished.;37.7586269230769;-121.934136538462
