Streak of light from left to right near top of Mt. Diablo in San Ramon, CA.;2015-03-05 18:30:00;10 seconds;Streak of light from left to right near top of Mt. Diablo in San Ramon, CA. Our living room window face north where we have a clear view of Mt. Diablo.  This particular evening, my daughter and I were home while my husband was at work teaching evening classes.   While our daughter was doing her homework at the table, I was getting ready to close our blinds.  I saw this white streak of light or something that caught my attention and it flew from left to right near the top of Mount Diablo from my vantage point.  Having only been here since June of last summer, we were excited to be back in California from North Carolina.   My hair stood on end because in my mind, I knew what I saw and while I was processing this, I didn't t want to believe this.   I asked around and apparently found out that this area in the Central Valley/East Bay (San Ramon) area is known to be a hot spot for activity.  This truly scares me because I'm so used to hearing/seeing this in the media but never did I expect to see what I had seen that evening.  It truly scares me.  I won't go near there as I know people hike the territory etc., when I drive into work every morning, to be honest, I'm scared to death of walking to my car because it's so dark and creepy here.  It really is.  For anyone that knows this area well, it is.  I wish we had known this prior to moving here.;37.7586269230769;-121.934136538462
