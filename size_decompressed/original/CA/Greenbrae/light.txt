We were heading back home towards the east I saw a big star: must have been Saturn or something. And below it was also a star.  I looked at it and it started to blick at me as if to say hello, you are not alone in the universe.  We are glad to meet you.  We are blinking just for you because we know who you are.  It blinked rapidly on and off for about a minute, then went dark.  I felt very calm, happy, and at peace.;37.9483;-122.5379
