A bright light moving in a straight line too fast for a plane and too slow for a meteor;2007-03-01 20:19:00;10 sec;A bright light moving in a straight line too fast for a plane and too slow for a meteor A bright white oval, moving in a straight line, far too slow for a meteorite and far too fast for an airplane.  The light did not blink or have a tail. It moved beyond the horizon.  At first it seemed like a meteorite, then it seemed like a plane falling out of the sky, given its slowness and size.  The straight-line trajectory makes me think it was most likely a meteor or a falling piece of space junk. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
