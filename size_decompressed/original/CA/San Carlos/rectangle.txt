Eerie rectangular shape in san carlos CA;2009-12-14 00:00:00;5+ minutes;Eerie rectangular shape in san carlos CA I was delivering Pizza and noticed a rhombus/parrellagram shape with 3 flashing lights on it.  I thought it was a plane at first but it was flying way to low and way to slow.  It was a very very eerie event, because I see planes all the time.;37.4967;-122.2665
