Large ball of white light low in the sky streaking at high speed towards ground.  Diminished in size as it shot overhead until finally shrunk to nothing.  No surrounding light or noise.  Looked the same size, brightness and shape as a full moon on a clear night at first sight.  Several other motorists stopped to watch as it shot past us.;37.4967;-122.2665
