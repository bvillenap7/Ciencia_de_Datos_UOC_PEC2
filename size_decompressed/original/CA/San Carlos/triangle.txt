Red Triangles Near San Francisco Bay Area Northern Sky;2004-02-14 23:00:00;1 hour;Red Triangles Near San Francisco Bay Area Northern Sky Aproximately 23:00 PST, a friend and I were heading to the market when I noticed 2 orange/red triangles in the northern sky. The objects resebled triangles with a red dot similar to a nuclei near their base. The objects appeared to be moving away in a north easterly direction. During their visability the Objects would revolve around one another and eventually appeared to merge into a singular object ( Possible Angle of Vision responsible ) The Merged Object began to move away in an accelerated fassion again in the North Easterly direction. Aproximately 5 minutes after loosing sight of the Objects, a plume with a redish/orange coloration began to appear faintly at a great distance. I would Estimate at the 40,000 Ft+ lvl. This plume began to grow and then out of nowhere a new triangle became visible near the location where the first two were sighted. Aproximately 20 witness were on hand from a small valentines day party that was taking place.;37.4967;-122.2665
