Star flying South with purpose like an aircraft;2010-11-09 21:30:00;1 min;Star flying South with purpose like an aircraft One object alone was seen. Flying Southward, it looked exactly like a star in the night sky BUT it was moving horizontally (south) and with purpose, like an aircraft.  It had all of the characteristics of a star commonly seen in the sky but did not move like a normal star.  We are just average joes that happened to notice this so we thought it would be important to report.  We initially thought it was a satellite but are thought satellites orbit outside of our atmosphere.  We want to remain anonymous.
