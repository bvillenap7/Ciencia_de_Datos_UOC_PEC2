What I saw  was a star like object moving slowly across the sky and then speed up really fast, and then disappeared.  										Showing up again with in seconds to the N/W sky.  This when I recorded the object.  Then, very quickly, was moving up and down and would disappear and be in a different place, when it reappeared.											  It also would go to a spot repeatedly to where what seemed to be three smaller star like objects, shaped in kind of a diamond with a reddish glow in the middle, I'm guessing.
