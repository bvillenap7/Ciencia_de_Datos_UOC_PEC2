Did not float away like a typical helium balloon. This was not a hallucination or anything close. However, it first appeared like just a basic (foil) balloon that was shaped like a sun...round with a bunch of pointed things.  Like a disk-star shape. After watching it, it didn't float up any higher, or come down any lower. It just hovered and drifted. My daughter, coincidentally, saw the same object...reported to me later. She saw it about 1/2 mile from where I was . Thought it was very unusual...as it seemed to be controlled in the way it was hovering...it was very peculiar. Looked like it was being remotely controlled and it was not too high up (maybe 500 feet- maximum).;32.9937;-117.2598
