luminiscent sphere;2004-04-30 19:30:00;10 minutes;luminiscent sphere My 15 year old son was at home alone.  Just at sunset he glimpsed a light in the field behind our house.  He went outside.  As he opened the door his cat ran inside apparently scared.  He stepped out onto a porch and looked east and down the property.  He saw a light object flash briefly (like the speed of lightning).  It was very bright, about the brightness of the moon.  It was about 350 yards from the house. Shortly again he saw the same type of object appear about 30 feet away next to the barn.  It was a solid object which gave off light.  It was approximately 10 ft. wide and 12 feet high.  It was spherical and clearly defined in shape.  The color of the light was white.  Before the last sighting he felt the air as breezy and cool then it suddenly changed to very still and warm.  He was very startled by the experience  He ran back into the house, turned on all the lights and played loud music until his brother returned. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS' MOTHER))  Correction - (mother speaking) I am sorry about the date on the previous 2 submissions.  I should explain.  I went to a movie on the night my son saw the object.  When I made the report I looked up the date on my ticket stub then I submitted the report.  But then I looked at the data base and saw the report for Cotati on the next night.  Cotati is only 3 miles to the north of our house.  I  looked up the date my ticket purchase was recorded by the bank and it was ofcourse the next day.  However, if the date on the ticket stub is correct, the sighting must have been on the 30th. I'm very sorry for muddling up the issue.;38.3129;-122.6441
