I was watching one of those flashing disco in the sky lights for a few hours, while outside on a porch with friends looking into the sky east past Shasta.  It seemed very suspicious, as the lights were even flashing between colors,  it was very far off and it stayed in a constellation with 2 background stars as the constellations rose from the east.   At about 3:30am, a second flashing light flew up from the south, they did a dance, and the second one replaced the first one.  The first one then greatly dropped altitude at around a 20 degree angle from vertical down and then took off straight east towards Nevada at a much lower altitude skimming the mountain top. Pretty much the only popultion center is the I-5 corridor so it isn't hard to do some basic trig to hide in constellations.  Now that I've seen one of these they seem to be all over N.
