Bright gold/white light flying low over Lake Shastina area.;2012-02-03 05:30:00;1-2 minutes;Bright gold/white light flying low over Lake Shastina area. An extremely large ball of white/gold light-- brighter and bigger than any star, yet star-like in nature.  It was flying very low and in total silence from the horizon behind Lake Shastina and traveling towards Mt. Shasta. The night sky was dark and clear as the moon had set already.   There was no noise anywhere at five-thirty in the morning dead quiet.  It made it's way within a minute to the Shastina cone of Mt. Shasta, faded to a dim spot, and seemed to drift down into the mountain jaw dropping.  I don't see things like this... ever.  To be honest I see satellites but this was just too bright and golden colored-- and too big.  There was no way a plane could have passed over without being heard by me-- it was too low.  Today, one day later, a big black helicopter flew over-- never seen one of those here, either, and it was loud.;41.4201;-122.3933
Flickering light over the house and funny star close by.;2017-10-29 05:45:00;4 seconds;Flickering light over the house and funny star close by. Oct 29, 2017, I was awake at 5:45 am.  As I was looking outside where it was very dark and then the lawn was flickering with light.  It lasted about 4 seconds.  This area is probably 100’ x 200’, and the house sits in the middle.  The light was not extremely bright, and it seemed to come from over the house, as if a helicopter was hovering over the house (there was none) and there was no sound..  Then I looked out beyond the yard and saw a large star north east of Mt. Shasta very low in the sky slowly go straight down very slowly behind the mountains that are about 10 miles away.;41.4201;-122.3933
