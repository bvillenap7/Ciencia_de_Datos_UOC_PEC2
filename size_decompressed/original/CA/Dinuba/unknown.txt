Lights over Central Valley California;2007-12-09 18:00:00;2 to 3 min;Lights over Central Valley California It looked like the edge of something larger, it was small red and white lights all next to each other and then I could barely make out a light was illuminating from the top of it, you can see the light coming from the top better in the picture I took.  The whole thing only lasted a couple of minutes and in that time it passed from the far south sky to the far north sky before I couldnâ€™t see it anymore.  I was looking up and towards the east  when I first saw it and it was moving south to north.  Thats pretty much it. I hope maybe you guys can shed some light on what it was I saw.  Thanks for your time;36.5346;-119.3909
