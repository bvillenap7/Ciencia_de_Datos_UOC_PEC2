four red light in shape of a triangle gliding over the city of Dinuba CA.;2009-02-02 20:45:00;2 to 3 minutes;four red light in shape of a triangle gliding over the city of Dinuba CA. February 02, 2009    Between 8 and 9 o’clock, I stepped outside, like I normally do around this time to smoke a cigarette before heading to sleep.  I like gazing up at the stars while I’m smoking and that night I heard like a humming sound, I looked around and then proceeded to look up at the sky.  From the corner of my eye (towards my right) I noticed something coming in fast.   As I turned to see what I had seen, the object slowed down and glided across Dinuba, CA.  I would guess about 1 ½ from where I was standing and about ½ mile up in the sky.  I know that this was not a plane because I have seen planes go across the sky and this did not move like an aircraft.  It had four red lights and it was in shape of a triangle.  Three lights coming down one side and one on the other side.   I ran inside the house and got my mom to go outside.  My mom also seen what I had seen and she was just saying, What the heck is that?  It glided for about five minutes and then it just speeded off.  Before speeding off, the lights turned from red to a yellowish orange color and then it speeded off.
