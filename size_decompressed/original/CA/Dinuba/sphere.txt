This day I noticed, what I thought was a flock of birds circling, a group of sphere-like flying objects several feet in the air. Approxmate height in the atmospher is around the level a long distance commerical flight would fly. I thought at the beginning it was a flock of birds, but they were hard to make out and appeared to be 1/3 of the size of a commerical plane flying by seconds after they disappeared. 10-12 sphere flew in a circle 8 pattern in two separate locatioins in the air and flew at a rather high speed considering the height in the air. They flew in two separate locations for approx. 10 minutes. They disappeared as soon as two commerical airlines flew into view from the south and east. It truly an amazing sight to see with our two 2 year olds and 5 year old as we viewed the the sky from the front yard of our house.;36.5346;-119.3909
