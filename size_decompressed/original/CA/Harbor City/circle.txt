We then saw this object appear at 3:00 (position to plane)and had a circular/disk shape. It followed alongside(@3:00)to the jet for minutes. My girfriend & I were at a coffee shop and had a cup of coffee. I walked her to her car and we were looking how pretty the sky was and how pretty the jet smoke trailed out from the jets across the sky. We could see perfect detail on the jet like the wings, rear tail, etc. We then noticed after looking 20-30 seconds at the jet a circular object that at first I thought was an escort jet. I realized that it was completely circular, metallic in color, appeared larger than the jet, and left a very short tail maybe 2 object lengths long. The trail was not smoke. The object was alongside the object at 3:00 and stayed there for the duration of the sighting. I could not make any out any detail except completely circular that seemed to glow a bit.;33.7987;-118.2993
