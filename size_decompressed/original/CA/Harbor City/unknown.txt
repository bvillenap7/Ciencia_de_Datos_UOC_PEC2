UFO Sighting in Harbor City, CA area;2008-12-21 06:40:00;3 minutes;UFO Sighting in Harbor City, CA area Around 6.40 pm last night, we were driving east bound on Anaheim ave. as we saw something in the sky. It was a purple light that kept moving from left to right and than up and down, in very fast motion. As it moved it also changed colors 2 times. The person sitting next to me said that it had multiple different lights on it. We can explain this sighting other than it must have been UFO. We have never seen anything like that. It couldn't be an airplane because it moved very fast and in a strange motions. This would be impossible for any aircraft to move like this. We believed this lights were above the park near by so we drove that direction. There was no one at the park, it was very dark already, but the lights disappeared.;33.7987;-118.2993
