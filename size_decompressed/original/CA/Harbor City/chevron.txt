On August 2 about 10:30pm in Harbor City, CA a 45 year old Californian of European and Scandinavian ancestry.was laying down in the driver's seat of his car, looking in the sky while listening to the radio, when an object shaped like a trapezoid or a thin thimbal flew silently over the Harbor City and Lomita border, travelling from north to the south. This object was decending as it moved along. There were no lights and it was a greyish color.  I was able to see it because the city lights illuminated it to a certain degree, from below. I lost sight of it when it was low to the ground and a few miles away. I was confused as to what that was. At first I thought it was a white owl flying late to nest, when I concluded it had no wings. Guessing it's altitude as it passed overhead, 1,500 feet.  Size, possibly 100 feet long and it seemed to be going at a few hundred mph.  Around 10:45pm another object went from west to the east at approximately the Lomita and Palos Verdes border, at approximately 3000 feet and 500 mph, silently. Lit from below from the city lights, I could see the shape was a flying wing. This object must have been about half a mile wide.  It looked top heavy because it was higher top to bottom than it was long, from front to back.  The shape of the back side was irregular.  There were shapes such as tubes and other shapes.  There were 5 dim lights on the underside, shining a yellowish white light.  I saw no windows or beings of any kind. The objects weren't doing anything except as I described, flying straight and/or descending.;33.7987;-118.2993
