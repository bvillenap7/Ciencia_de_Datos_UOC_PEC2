Slow moving ball of light.;2011-07-30 22:00:00;10 seconds;Slow moving ball of light. I've lived here for about 6 years now and I'm a sky gazer.  For the past 4 weeks or so, I have been seeing strange lights in the northern sky.  I've only seen one at a time.  They look like bright stars, but they are moving slowly in the sky.  I only see them for a few seconds before they completely just disappear. Last nights sighting was a little different.  This time it was closer and it flared and then disappeared. In the 6 years I've lived here, I have never seen these before.  They are not airplanes.  I see airplanes all the time in the night sky and I know the flight patterns.  These are just balls of light that appear and disappear.  They don't blink, or pulse, other than the one that flared brighter before it disappeared.;36.7071;-119.1814
