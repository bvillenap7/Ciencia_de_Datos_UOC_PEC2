Strange light has ocasional shape and departs at high speeds.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a star or planet.  PD));2010-04-21 22:00:00;every week;Strange light has ocasional shape and departs at high speeds. Object appears between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM for a specific duration of 1:38:00.  From my point of view level being 0° objects settles at roughly 25°.   Object may appear up to three nights a week and has no movement other than when you stare at it a optical illusion makes it seem to move.  However when viewed through a telescope it appears to have shape and remains solid in position.  Object does change colors but I can’t determine if it’s actual color change or just atmospheric light distortion.   The only reason the object caught my attention is the abrupt entry and exit speeds of the object.  I have clearly seen aircraft around the object by the indicator lights on the aircraft, but the aircraft’s were not pursuing the object.   Unfortunately I’ve tried both camera and video camera to capture the object but all I capture is a big blurry ball.  I’ve tried to take a picture through the telescope but this also was a failure.   I cannot determine the entry and exit speeds however it does leave a trail of light through the sky which only lasts briefly.  It’s entry and exit patterns very day by day.   Too dark to get a genuine shape however occasionally I will get a glimpse of a reflective surface on moonlit nights.   There is no noise that I can hear from this distance and other people have seen it but think it’s an optical illusion and I believe it could be an optical illusion myself however it might be worth checking out.;36.7071;-119.1814
