WE WERE LOOKING AT HAIL BOP AND MY SON SAID LOOK AT THAT,I WAS LOOKING THROUGH BINOCKLURES AND SAW A TRIANGULAR SHAPED CRAFT WITH WINDOWS,YA WINDOWS. IT HAS TAKEN ME YEARS TO TELL ANYONE BECAUSE WHAT I SAW IN THE CRAFT SCAIRED THE HELL OUT OF ME. IT MADE NO SOUNDS,AFTER A SHORT TIME IT TURNED WEST AND IT WENT AWAY FAST. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We think that Hale-Bopp was most visible from North America in late March 1997, but that is only an estimate based on memory.  PD));38.1654;-122.2573

It was loud and flying slow, but changed direction. I heard something quite loud right over my house and ran to the window.  I saw a large unidentified craft flying pretty low and slow.  It was about 300 feet up in the air and I could not see its color.  It was flying south and in a straight line but then started flying sideways.  It soon went out of sight.;38.1654;-122.2573
