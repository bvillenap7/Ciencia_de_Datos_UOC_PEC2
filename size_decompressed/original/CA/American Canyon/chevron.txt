I stopped in the middle of the road. driving my car to the store and looked up to see a chevron shaped craft overhead. approximately 300 feet in the air with blinking lights on the two ends.  very low and going very slow. I stopped in the middle of the street to watch where it was headed but it was too slow and I was sitting in traffic.  Others had to see it.   I then drove to the store and bought something. I was in the store for about 5 minutes and drove back to my house.  The craft was still overhead, a little further away but it was hovering in mid air. I then ran back inside my home to report this. I have seen quite a few unidentified objects recently and wonder if it has anything to do with the power station across the street from my house.;38.1654;-122.2573
