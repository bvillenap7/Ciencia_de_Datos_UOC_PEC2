I can see planes flying towards Ontario Airport all the time.  I saw an object that felt closer than it should be and it was moving very slowly, almost just hovering.  It had 2 lights, white and red. it moved slower and slower and then it stopped tilted on it's side and shot off.  As it moved, I could see underneath a green, neon pattern of some sort. It was very loud and it disappeared quickly.  I have never seen anything like it.;34.2354;-117.2345
