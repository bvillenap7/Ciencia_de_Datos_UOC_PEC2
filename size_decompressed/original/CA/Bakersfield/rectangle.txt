The three of us were laying, in the front yard. We were watching the night sky for shooting stars or weird stuff as we normally do. When my youngest cousin says whats that it looks like a big bird. I then look up and focused into the Nw part of the sky and saw a rectangular object moving slowy across the sky. Were the wings would be both sides were dark, and the body seemed to be grayish.There were no lights on it and made no sound. I ran across the street to get my cousins and when we came out and looked up it was gone......For once in my life i know what i saw and is what not a plane or any thing iv ever seen before.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
