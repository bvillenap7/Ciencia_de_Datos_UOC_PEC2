A saucer flew over the roof of my car several times.  ((anonymous report));2002-06-06 01:00:00;15 minutes;A saucer flew over the roof of my car several times. Some time ago, while I was headed South on I-5, outside Bakersfield CA, a flying saucer made several passes over the roof of my car.  I did look out my window and could see an array of circular lights on the disk as it was approximately at each pass about 100 feet from the roof of my car.  I did not stop and maintained a speed of 60 mph as I was extremely afraid, but at the same time curious.  This happened in a time frame of about 15 minutes.  The saucer would sway out from my cars roof to 45 degrees to the side of the car at 200 feet then swing back over my roof.  It then would go to the other side of my car at about 45 degrees to an altitude of 200 feet again.  The diameter of the saucer was approximately 50 feet. I was outside of the city limits of Bakersfield, driving along the I-5 an oddly I was the only car on the freeway headed South.  I did not notice any traffic headed North bound either?  Was this an attempt by aliens to abduct me?  Yet they elected not to EMP my car, because I would have crashed.  Do you think they were waiting for me to stop the car?  The year was 2002.

We were out side watchin for shootin stars after we lit off the fireworks and at about 12:30 my buddy noticed 3 circular objects travling at what I would say pretty fast concidering how far away they appered to be, I would say at least the distance of the moon they were travling in a triangular or pyramid shape they were totaly across the sky in about 30 seconds well it was more like 3/4ths of the sky from were we took notice and were they vanished. once they were about to the third quarter of the sky one by one they took off out of sight starting with the first (tip of the triangle then the right corner then the left corner. We stayed up looking for about an hour or so and didn't see a thing. I have had an interest in extrterestrials but have never seen any thing out of the ordanary untill yesterday and I am going to spen more time looking twords the stars in hopes of seeing another simlar or closer ufo or what ever and I will hopefuly have a good camera that I can snap a shot and send you gies but intill then, later ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have observed the triplet of satellites, thought to be part of the U.

Dark disk or hole in sky motionless, small shiney  object looked to exit and fly away from dark one at high speed.;2005-06-15 16:00:00;1 min;Dark disk or hole in sky motionless, small shiney  object looked to exit and fly away from dark one at high speed. Accured in Bakersfield California and objects were over the vicinity of bear mountain between Bakersfield, Arvin, and Tehachapi california. during a sunny day with clear skys i saw a large dark (completely black) circle in the blue sky. it appeared to be very large and very high. Realative diameter would be the same as a dime held at arms length. the dark circle was motionless and appeared very suddenly in an area i had already been looking and did not see how it apeared it was suddenly just there. it was so dark and round with no light reflection that it looked like a literal hole in the sky. after about 20 or 30 seconds I witnessed a much smaller object move from the dark circle and move at high speed directly to the south. the smaller object was bright white or silver in color with a high ammount of reflection from the sun which was behind me. the smaller object moved to the south east untill it was out of site, i turned my attention back to the larger dark circle and it was still there motionless for several seconds longer, i took my eyes off of it for just about 3 to 5 seconds to attempt to use my video camera which I forgot i had next to me on the bench.  when I could not see the dark circle through the viewfinder I looked with my naked eye to make sure i had the camera at the right angle, but when I looked up it was gone. The dark circle stuck out very well against the blue sky which I had a good area of view of but could not see it anywhere, it was gone as suddenly as it came. and i regret I did not see how it functioned to come and go. was it a hole that closed up? or a craft that accelerated quickly or turned on some kind of optical stealth? who knows. the difference in size between the large dark circle and the small shiney object was equivalent to a boweling ball and a small marble;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924

She said it was a circle with bright lights. She said it didn't look like any kind of plane.  Well it was started going over toward this gas station but by the mountain . People were stoping and taking picture of this ufo. The ufo was staying in that same spot for ten minutes and it was very low.  A truck driver told my friend that there were 5 more in town. Then the army went to the gas station and started taking peoples phone away from them.  My friend then told me to go outside and see if I can see anything. So I went outside and I thought it was a plane at first but the lights were not blinking and it starting coming down closer and I can tell it was a circle with lights all the way around it.  I went inside to tell some family members to come check this out. And they couldn't believe what they were seeing. Then the ufo went higher up in the sky and stayed up there for about 30 minutes to an hour then just left.  My friend was also telling me it looked like it was landing behind the mountain and the army people and some men is black suites were asking her if there was away up to the mountains this way and she said yes.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Neon green and red lights seen Danicing in the Eastern Bakersfield skies;2008-07-25 03:35:00;4 minutes;Neon green and red lights seen Danicing in the Eastern Bakersfield skies At approximately 3:35AM as I was on my way home from work I seen in the Eastern Direction a Green Neon light that seemed to be dancing as I would describe it, in the sky towards what is known as the Tehachapi Mountains. Although I do not believe it was that far. The Neon green light sometimes went to red very briefly but at some points the neon green color would be brighter than other times. Then the light would disappear for a moment. From the movement of it did not seem like a plane or a flare or anything of that sort. It just seemed to “dance” up and down swaying side to side. That is the only way I know how to describe it. I watched it for about 4 minutes after noticing it then I drove off to get home.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924

It was a very clear and cold January latenight .  When i'd stepped out to close my gate someone had left open .  And just as i was about to go back inside .  I'd noticed a very bright white light low in the western night sky .  At first ,  I'd thought it was just a jet .  But with my mini binocular i just happen to have in the pocket of my fleece pullover .  I soon seen ,  it was no jet plane .  This craft was circular in shape .  Perhaps 30-40 ft. around with a Garnet Red luminous ring from top to bottom around the craft .  It looked to be part of the craft which was heading my way .  Just then i'd called out to a friend of my .  Who was inside my house to come check this out .  As he stepped out to see what was up ,   I just handed him my mini binocular's and said ,  &quot check it out &quot .  We both got a good close look at the craft heading from west to east .  As we stood watching ......  the craft began to slow then stopped .  A plume of smoke cloa! ked the craft ......  perhaps ,  so was not too see it ?   Once the craft began to moving eastward for a moment ,  then stopped again .   Once again it cloaked itself w/ a plume of smoke .  Both time's the plume of smoke  was the same shape as the craft itself .  As we stood passing the binoculars back and forth trying to determine just what is we're looking at .  The craft began to move  ( actually float )  passing right thru the plume of smoke that cloaked east bound .   It didn't get far ......  before it made a sharp righthand .  Still floating and now heading south ........  Vanished .  And was gone ,  only the star's in the clear cold nightsky were visible .  Where the craft had just been .   But the strangest thing other the craft itself .  Was those 2-plume's of what I thought to be smoke .  They both began stretching out first flat and then apart .  To the point of a fine Cat Whisker .  I can't quite recall ever seeing smoke as I know it .  Act in this manner .....! ..  I know what is wasn't that cold January night ......  I sa! w .

Me and my friends saw a big orange ball descend from the sky and release 3 small orange balls onto earth, and it went back up and away.;2010-06-30 03:00:00;2 minutes;Me and my friends saw a big orange ball descend from the sky and release 3 small orange balls onto earth, and it went back up and away. This is my 2nd UFO sighting.  I was with my boyfriend and my best friend one night, and we were being loud in my parents house, so we got in my car, and drove a couple of streets away to a remote street.  I parked, turned off the car and started my iPod.  Maybe 4 minutes go by and we all see this big orange ball of dim light float slowly down from the sky.  It was round.  When it stopped very close, it released an identical ball, only smaller, and it floated off to the right (N), then a second to the left (S), and finally a third, straight below, and it seemed to not know where it was going.  It went to the right, left, right, then went straight down to earth.   I freaked out thinking it would find us or it was a bomb.  Then the big ball went slowly back up into the sky until it disappeared.   I started the car and left.  We all saw it.  We all want to know what it was.

Orange Lights Over Bakersfield California;2011-07-30 22:30:00;5-10 minutes;Orange Lights Over Bakersfield California On the night of July 30th, 2011, at approximately 10:30 PM, my son had gone out to the backyard.  He came back in right away, and told me to hurry and come outside.   I hurried out, and he pointed to the sky and there, in the West, was a long line of round, orange lights heading straight toward us.  There had to be at least a dozen to 20 of them.  They were in rows of 2-4 each.   I told my son to run and get his dad, because he's a skeptic, and he'd never believe it if he didn't see it for himself.  He came out and witnessed it too.    It was exciting, yet scary too, because my first thought was we were being attacked, and those were missiles.  But as they got closer, I could see that they weren't missiles...they were round objects, that  moved slowly in formation...all at the same pace, and they never moved out of that formation.  All of them were the same size.   There was absolutely no sound coming from them, and no flickering lights as they passed over us.  The sky was clear, with the exception of one small whispy cloud over the house next door.  Every one of those objects went into the cloud, and never came out.  There were openings in that small cloud, and we didn't see any of the objects pass by any of those openings.   When it was over, I tried to find out if anyone reported the sighting, but only one news station answered, and she said they were short handed and nobody reported it.   I went back outside to check the sky, and the cloud was gone as well.   It was very frustrating!  I was kicking myself for not running into the house and grabbing my cell phone to try to film it.  I was afraid if I went to look for my phone, I'd miss the event.   I don't know how high up the cloud was, or how low the objects were, but those objects had to be really big if that cloud was very high up, because they weren't  small dots in the sky.  They were a good size, and appeared to be  close.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924

Neon white craft in the southern Sierra mountain range.;2015-11-15 17:30:00;5 seconds;Neon white craft in the southern Sierra Mountain range. Let me start this by saying that I have had a lifelong interest in the ufo subject.  I am 29 years old and was born and raised in Bakersfield, CA.  Despite this, I have never seen anything that I could not explain in the sky.  I believe that changed on Sunday, November 15, 2015. I was driving home on Rancheria rd. which lies about 10-15 miles east of Bakersfield. Rancheria runs north and south and will take you from east Bakersfield all the way up to the Alta Sierra area. This particular day was a very rare and stormy day for this area. There was rain, snow and tiny hail coming down all day.  I am a 4x4 enthusiast and was going up a trail called Freeway Ridge with a small group of friends.  This trail starts at hwy. 178 and ends at Evans flat campground and traverses through the southern sierras.  After a long and muddy day of 4 wheeling we finally reached the end of the trail.  Rancheria road is the quickest way back to Bakersfield.  Rancheria is winding road that is very dangerous, especially when wet. We were going south at an average of about 15 mph.  It is 25 miles back to Bakersfield as the crow flies but it takes at least an hour to drive on any given day.  Visibility was very low because of rain, fog, and mud covered vehicles.  This day it took us about 1.5 hrs to travel this 25 mile road.   Now on to my sighting.  About 15 miles south of Evan's Flat campground, I see a light coming down towards the mountain.  It looked like a small plane at first and was approx. 4-500 yards to my left.  I am a golfer, so I feel like I am a good judge of yardage.  I almost panicked at first because it looked like this small plane was going to crash into the mountain to my left.  It was very low to the tree line.   As I focused in on this light (difficult with mud covered windows/windshield) I could see that it was not a plane of any kind.  I got a clear look at it for about 3-4 seconds.  It was 2 bright neon white round balls with a thin neon white line connecting them.  It did not produce any halo of light behind it.  It was traveling on a horizontal plane and coming down diagonally towards the ground.  Its flight is why I originally thought a plane was going to crash.  After the 3-4 seconds, I could see it fly behind some trees, and then it disappeared.  Let me also mention that this was 15 min. after sunset with complete cloud cover and rain.  It was basically dark outside. While this whole experience was seemingly mundane it was also very spectacular to me.  I couldn't begin to come up with a logical explanation of what this thing could have been.  It gave me the chills and made the hair on my body stand on end. I apologize for the wordy post but I wanted to be as thorough as possible.  Strange things are definitely out there. Thank you!;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924

Strange light objects in central California.   ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-23 05:00:00;10 minutes;Strange light objects in central California I went to check mailbox early in the morning and noticed what looked like a satellite tracking through the sky. I watched it for a few second and notice another object behind it, and then another appeared. There ended up to be 15-20 objects tracking in a straight line across the sky. They had the same appearance as a satellite in the early morning before the sun comes up, how you can only see them in a certain part of the sky because the not yet risen sun is shinning on them. They appeared in the southeast sky and and lost illumination in the northeast sky. I thought that was odd because of the orientation of sun in the early morning will usually illuminate satellites all the way into the southern sky. Anyway, I shot some video with my cell phone, but it came out real grainy of course. I tried to theorize what it possible could have been, at the time I thought maybe a meteor or some string of satellites. Meteor would be out of the question though because all! the objects were uniform in size and there was no flare like activity and they were illuminating themselves or reflecting the sunlight. The whole event lasted for about ten minutes;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
