One dim light grouping with two other dim lights in a triangle pattern, switching directions;2003-07-05 23:30:00;appx. 1 minute;One dim light grouping with two other dim lights in a triangle pattern, switching directions Me and my friend were laying outside (after he had previously seen a group of ufos the night before) in hope of spotting some.  At about 11:30 he points out a dim light moving across the sky.  It was not blinking, therefore not an airplane.  However, my first conclusion was a satallite.  After watching it move forward (from the position we were watching it) it grouped up with 2 other dim lights and changed direction, heading right (from our point of view).  We watched them as they formated into a perfect triangle and moved over a certain amount of sky.  They eventually traveled forward and, due to ambient light, we lost the sight of them.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Bright white light (twice the size of Mars) moving slowly in the sky and then fading out.;2003-09-21 19:45:00;10 seconds;Bright white light (twice the size of Mars) moving slowly in the sky and then fading out. I was outside smoking a cigarette looking up at the stars and was facing east so I could see Mars when a bright light appeared moving very slowly just north of where Mars was.  I am not a good judgement of distance or speed but this was pretty high and moving alot slower than an airplane.  This light was twice the size of Mars and really a bright white.  I watched it for approximately 10 seconds and then it just faded out.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
UFO sighting over Bakersfield, CA that lasted for almost an hour!!!!;2004-04-28 21:15:00;45 minutes;UFO sighting over Bakersfield, CA that lasted for almost an hour!!!! UFO Description: As seen by myself (36 year old graphic designer) and my girlfriend (42 year old events manager) from our apartment balcony - A dramatically moving bluish-white light. Through binoculars we could just make out an oval shape and a slight glowing purple mixed in with the blue. It was like looking at both a star and an oval-shaped, lit, flourescent black-light tube.  Duration of sighting: 45 minutes.  Direction (best guess): 290 degrees W by NW from our location.  Location in sky: 17 - 20 arc degrees above the horizon.  Weather: Unusually windy - very gusty.  UFO behavior: Zipping, darting, sharp and rounded/sharp sudden changes in flight, lazy zig-zag pattern, abrupt descension and ascension, inverted arcing patterns (opposite of Falling Leaf), sudden speed changes, long and short bursts in a direction. All the while a liquid smooth flight that was a testimony to the mastery over gravity. We eventually stopped watching only due to the fact that the UFO had eventually made it's way far enough North/West that the dust in the air (due to all the winds that evening) made viewing almost impossible at that distance. When we went back inside it could just barely be seen by us but, was still doing it's thing. We went back outside 10 minutes later and it was still there, barely visible. I went back out alone another 15 minutes later and both the UFO and the gusty winds were completely gone.   Special Note: I have FIVE MINUTES of video footage! Yes it's your typical grainy footage/blurry light evidence BUT, what makes this video stand out is that on three seperate occasions I had a stationary refernce point (power lines, tree tops and a plane that flew by) to be able to campare and signify the UFO's movements!!!  Opinions: Considering the duration of this sighting (and the fact that the only reason we stopped looking was that the UFO had moved off to another location for others to witness), I still can't believe at the time of the filing of this report (two days later) that I still haven't heard anything on the news.  May my UFO footage be a testimony to the fact that there can, indeed, be a UFO right in front of our faces and no one would even know because most of us are too preoccupied with trivial things and we have forgotten to look up.  I feel fortunate to have witnessed two events, now, in my life (first sighting was late November, 1994 in San Jose, CA.  I feel even more fortunate that this time I caught it on tape! ((NUFORC Note:  We surmised that the witness might have been looking at Venus, but he took strong exception to that suggestion.  We include some of his comments below.  No other sightings reported from this area of the country for the same time and date.   We believe that the description of the location of the anomalous object matches the location of Venus in the night sky, but the witness strongly disputes that fact.  He claims, after the fact, that he could see Venus, as well.  The video would resolve whether there was one, or two bright objects in the northwestern sky.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Pardon my bluntness but, IS THIS A JOKE?      I am an amateur astronomer and I know EXACTLY what Venus looks like and I know EXACTLY where it is every evening. Along with - as far as all the other naked-eye planets that can currently be observed - Saturn, then Jupiter and in the Eastern sky, Mars, all seen as of 9:00 p.m. every evening.      Lets say we are up in the sky looking down at the land and setting Venus in the west is in the 12:00 position, making north in the 3:00 position. The UFO would have been between the 1:00 and 2:00 position. Like my report said, about 290ยบ west by north west. A significant difference in position.      I can imagine you have to be extremely cautious about screening people who think this whole UFO/Contact subject is a joke and I can respect that but, please DO NOT treat me like half of the populace on this planet (opinions may vary) - too uneducated to know the difference between a planet and a street light.      I have video evidence, I mentioned that in my report. All someone has to do is view the footage I shot and the evidence is clear. Three times I caught the UFO on tape flying next to (as seen on a one demensional screen) stationary objects. These three objects were across the street from my location so it's not like I could just move the camera around to make a stationary object in the sky look like it was moving around. I have the UFO flying behind POWER LINES, around TREE TOPS and sharing the same section of sky while a PLANE FLEW BY.      God, almighty! I take the time to try and share my experience with the organizations that can benefit from this (one problem has always been a lack of proof) and I actually HAVE some proof that can help support and legitimize this highly controversial subject and I get the typical Project Blue Book treatment. You saw Venus      I don't mean to be rude or disrespectful, Peter, but, REALLY. You know darn well the description of the movements of the UFO in my report doesn't even come CLOSE to describing Venus or any other planet. Nor did it look or behave like any type of plane, helicopter, balloon, remote controlled object (which still has to obey the laws of physics as the big objects like a jumbo jet and can't turn on a dime), flare, meteorite, fireball, comet, satellite, the International Space station or any kind of bird, bat, or owl.      This is VERY frustrating and I could understand when I had my first sighting in San Jose back in '94 why very few believed me. Evidence is key. Otherwise you hear, Do you live next to an airport? Di dyou have anything to drink tonight? That is why I bought my $1500.00 digital camcorder two years ago. I told myself I would never forgive myself if I didn't at least try and be prepared for another sighting (although I never expected to see another one). I just couldn't take the chance.      I have a massively bruised shin from hitting the door jam when cutting the corner too close when running into my bedroom, and a door to my balcony who's bottom hinges now knock whenever I open or close it due to the fact that I slammed it open too hard when I came in from my balcony to scream at my girlfriend to Get out here and look! all in the name of trying to get my digi-cam as fast as I could. I truely expected the sighting to be over by the time I got back outside. Please reconsider this. You're passing up a legitimate sighting with video evidence!

Star like object turn lights off after being flashed with light and took off, then came back 15 min later.;2007-04-14 21:30:00;about 40 min;Star like object turn lights off after being flashed with light and took off, then came back 15 min later. at around 9:30 pm it started raining pretty good outside so i went out back to take a look, I saw what appeard to be a very bright star well below the cloud layer maybe 300 feet high or so. it seemed odd but i didnt pay too much attention and went back to watching the rain. I then saw what appeared to be a small dimer star come out of the big bright star. I then figured this was an aircraft and checked for movement by standing so it appeared right next to a telephone pole a stationary object, to check for movement.  There was non.  The dimmer light took off to the north and went out of sight by this time. The very bright one just stayed there.  I then went in and got my night vision goggels what i believe to be russion helecopter pilot goggels no brand name if its important only markings are a c inside a triangle inside a circle and the letters OH 1x 20 if that information is needed. Looking at the starlight object was way too bright but could clearly see total cloud cover above it as the could cover was reflecting light very well. I then decided this was no aircraft or star and did what i always thought was a bad idea.  I took my dive light and pointed it at the object and began to flash it, seven flashes twice. The object which had been very bright and totaly still up till that time then shut off the light. An orange afterglow still was visable and it went skyward very fast through the cloud layer. this whole even took about 10 min. I waited and went in and out for about 15 min, and started looking over my house by the way to make sure it wasnt over me. After about 15 min the object again came back to the origanal location.  Wanting to get a better view i got my binoculars a pair of stiner comanders, they are old but work well.  what i saw was an object inside the light that appeared to look like the capital letter D. I watched it for about 15 more min as it changed color from bright orange to white.  It looked very much like a star but with the binoculars you could see an object insid! e the light quite well. I viewed the object till about 10:15pm and attempted to call my wife at her grandmothers house at the time, the phone didnt work at this time but gave me the option of leaving her a message. I since talked to her this morning and that message never made it to her.  I dont know if that is related or not.  I do know the object did take notice of me flashing it with my divelight and turned its lights down and took off. I also belive the object was small as it didnt seem very far away less than a mile, but cant be sure.  I do know it was much closer than an average helecoptor flying over the area and belive it was over the houseing track behind mine. As for the size and this is only a guess I would say the size of maybe a city trash can.  I will be looking at the sky much more now and if i see anything i will let you know.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
My sighting was in Bakersfield, California. I was leaving work late one night with my girlfriend (at the time) and another friendโwe wo;2009-05-01 22:00:00;1 second;My sighting was in Bakersfield, California.  I was leaving work late one night with my girlfriend (at the time) and another friendโwe worked in a performance theater, and had finished a show. It was around ten at night.  As we were preparing to get into the car, I happened to be facing the North-Western sky. My girlfriend also had a general view of that sector, but the other friend was distracted and looking elsewhere.  The sighting lasted no more than a second. Very suddenly, I see a light zoom over us in a north-westerly heading (I couldnโt discern any sense of a bodyโjust a light as if from an afterburner).  I judged its distance from its trajectory:  it wasnโt travelling โacross the skyโ but very perceptibly forward. Also, the size of the light subtended the same amount of area as, say, a golf ball held at armโs length (as it passed overhead).  These observations together led me to believe that it was relatively close to the ground-at least within 500 - 1000 feet.  Thatโs just the sense that I have, judging by how it moved across my field of view.  I didnโt feel like it was very far above us (not as far as a helicopter would be, for example). Its speed seemed notable:  it appeared and disappeared within less than a second, which, given I had a clear line of sight for quite a distance, is remarkable. The color of the light (or afterburner) was also notable: I remember it being not orange but a pale blue/green. Perhaps the most notable aspect of this sighting was the soundโor lack of it.  As it passed over us, I heard no sound.  Not an engine, not even the sound of a body moving quickly through the air.  Even a commercial airliner can be heard from the ground at some heights. Judging how close this seemed from its trajectory, I was so surprised that there was nothing. The night was as silent as before it appeared. After the quick moment, I exclaimed to my friends. As hinted earlier, my girlfriend had also seen โsomethingโ, though my other friend had not been looking at the sky (and without a sound, there was no reason to look up).  My girlfriend didnโt know what to think of what she had seenโshe would only ever say that, sure, she had seen somethingโI think she was less willing to attribute the sighting to anything and more comfortable with shrugging her shoulders. But I was surely confident that it was something extraordinary.  It may well have been just an advanced aircraft tested by the military, but it was certainly something you wouldnโt reckon youโd ever see.

Bright Light In Sky Suddenly Disappears.;2013-03-05 18:15:00;1-2  minutes;Bright Light In Sky Suddenly Disappears I was in my backyard on March 5th looking at the stars.  At approximately 6:15 PM, I saw what I thought was a bright star in the South East sky.  After watching it for about a minute, I realized it wasn't a star... that it was moving, and heading in a North West direction.  I decided to start filming it with my i-phone just in case it wasn't an airplane.  After filming it for about 30 seconds or so, it just suddenly disappeared in the sky.  It was clear that night, with no clouds. I didn't think it was a plane because it didn't flash any colored lights.  It was a bright light that looked similar to the ISS, but I knew it wasn't.  The ISS usually comes from the other direction.  I also checked the schedule to see if it was going over at that time, and it wasn't. I'm not very good at sending videos from my phone, it always says it's too large, but I have no problem sharing the video, if we can figure out how to get it to you.

Small white lights over BAKERSFIELD, CA;2013-08-14 22:30:00;~10 minutes;Small white lights over BAKERSFIELD, CA I was looking up at the sky at around 10:30 last night, because weโve been having a meteor shower and I hadnโt had the time to see one yet, as we live in a pretty bright area.  As I was looking up (facing south) I noticed there were four stars in a trapezoid shape.  I thought it was strange because Iโd never noticed that star constellation before, when all of a sudden the two โstarsโ on the right side of the trapezoid started to move upwards and westward, together. I called my fiancรฉ out to look. They had a very fluid movement to them, they moved together but sort of drifted a little more together and a little more apart at times.  They moved fairly quickly for what tiny lights we could see.  They looked just like dim stars but the lights pulsated instead of twinkled the way stars do. The lights ended up stopping to the west aligned with a bright star.  A few seconds after the lights stopped, the biggest meteor I have ever seen streaked across the sky, and right as it happened, the craft or crafts adjusted themselves to face where the meteor had just been. We continued to stare at the lights for about 10 minutes, but they just hung there, very still in the sky.  We decided to go inside.  A half an hour went by and my curiosity got the best of me, and I looked out to see the โstarsโ were still there, just frozen still.  Tonight the stars are no longer there, which is why we firmly believe we witnessed a UFO last night.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924

After a few minutes, the orange went away and what looked to be two red lights appeared in its place.  There was also a white light clustered just beneath these two red lights.
