Off to the south I saw a silver cylindrical shape which was horizontal and appeared to be a jet but was moving very slowly as it moved across the horizon north it changed shape and became more like a saucer continuing north it flattened out, wavered back and forth sideways and the completely disappeared into thin air.  The sky was completely blue.  There were no clouds for the object to disappear behind.  The object was flying in front of a mountain range which was visible behind the object.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Strange craft passed in front of the moon.;2006-03-11 18:00:00;2 Min;Strange craft passed in front of the moon. I would have reported this sooner if I had known your organization existed. I just learned of your site from the Discovery channel. The date of the siting is within 30 days of event date.  I live in the northern most part of Bakersfield California, In a small sister city called Oildale.  My son and I left our house traveling west bound on seventh standard road  just as the sun was setting, The sun had already dropped behind the mountians, but the sky was still illuminated enough to see. The moon was in the southwest portion of the sky over the city of bakersfield. The moon was halfway between straight up and the horizan, The sky was completely clear.  There was enough light from the sunset that you could still makeout a blue tint to the sky.  The moon was 1/3 crescent and looked like a giant sized cereal bowl slightly tilted as if it was spilling some of it contents. Thats what attracted my attention to the moon and I said to my son jokenly, Look the moon looks like a cereal bowl, maybe thats what GOD eats his breakfast out of.  My son who was 12 years old at the time started asking me some questions about the moon so I pulled off the road to look at the moon safely. We exited the car looked and talked about the moon for 2 or 3 minutes or so and just after I answered his last question. remember the sky is clear and there is still just enough light to see faint blue sky. The background was faint blue sky.  As we both where looking directly at the moon something like a dark, fuzzy like cloud started to move in front of the moon from the left side to the right, But there was no clouds. None! It was like the cloud/ship? was only visible as it moved in front of the moon and only at the right edge of the moon as it moved across.  This is where it really get strange and hard to discribe.  As this thing moved from the right side of the moon to the left, as more of it moved in front of the moon it changed from fuzzy dark smoky cloud looking to horizontal lines as it moved across in front of the moon. But the lines where like see through so you could see the moon through it. But you could still make out the lines.  It was like this ship, craft whatever it is. Was projecting an image from the outerspace side of it to the earth side of it and was having technical difficulties and not doing a very good job of it.  It only seemed to have trouble projecting the moons image, Because before it moved in front of and after it passed the moon it was invisible.  As for the size. It must have been huge because it covered the whole moon with its lines/image as it passed. The lines where something like when you get to close to a bigscreen TV. It was like there was a image line then a thinner black line then image line then thin black line etc.  The speed seemed slow. It took aprox 2 min maybe slightly less to pass completely in front of the moon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

orange light in sky in western sky;2008-08-24 19:00:00;7 minutes;orange light in sky in western sky we were sitting on our porch and looking towards the west.  my son asked me what that bright thing was in the sky.  we speculated a possible reflection of the sun from an aircraft or a large star, but it did not move.  I went in to to get the phone to call the local tv station to see if they knew what it was, they did not.  my son came to get me and told me that it had move rapidly to the right then as we watched it seemed to begin moving upward or to the left and looked as thought it had a possible flame.  we weren't sure what it was so looked online and found this sight looking for answers.  we could not have been the only one's to see this.
