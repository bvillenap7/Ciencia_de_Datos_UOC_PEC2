I made a complete stop and I froze from that sight.   I kept pushing my brakes hard, and still felt like some massive pull is trying to get my car to cross the gate.   I was really afraid at this point.  That's when the gate and the light disappear.   I never discussed or talked to anyone about this until a co-worker was talking to me about UFO's, and she gave this site to post what happened with me.  Even though it has been a long time ago.

Light Blue boomerang shaped object hovered.;2004-04-09 06:20:00;30 minutes;Light Blue boomerang shaped object hovered. The object was spotted east of Bakersfield towards the Tehachapi mountains.  The object was seen from far distance as a small mettalic like light blue object that shimmered in the light. The object hovered in the sky for several minutes without movement and slowely left from right several times and in and out of the clouds all for about 30 minutes.   We observed the object through binoculars and the craft appeared to be a dull baby blue color and the materieal seamed to be plastic like.  It almost seemed fake as if  the whole thing was an object from a cartoon or something.  Up close it was not mettalic at all, only at far distances did it seem this way.  At first glimpse the object was boomerang shaped.  Then throughout the 30 or so minutes the object slowly moved around and flipped over several times.   At second glance  the object seemed to flip slowely and at one instance the object seemed to be shaped like a large L on its side.  The object moved further into the sky until it was no longer noticeable.  The whole scene was surreal as if it we couldnt believe our eyes.  There was no condesation or anything left behind, however the object floated and was solid colored with no lights or anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Two  slow moving tethered objects;2004-05-13 18:55:00;15 minutes;Two  slow moving tethered objects I was standing in my driveway, looking northwest, and observed an airplane taking off from the local airport. I noticed an object, reddish in color, and angular, moving much slower than the airplane and quite a bit higher moving in almost the same direction, northwest to southeast. I then noticed quite a bit higher than this object was a small black dot, moving at exactly the same rate of speed as the reddish object, as though they were attached. My initial thought was a ballon or kite, but these objects were way higher than the the airplane. I ran inside to get my digital camera. I tried to focus on the objects,, but they did not show up in my viewfinder. I took pictures anyway. The object continued to move at a very slow pace until it was almost directly overhead, when my brother returned from a trip to the store. He immediately saw the objects as well. I gave him my camera nad told him to keep taking pictures while I went to get my video camera. When I came back, inoticed three or four of my neighbors also pointing and looking at the object. I tried to find the object in my camera viewfinder, but it did not show up. I took footage anyway. The object continued on a straight line, seemed to be gaining in altitude, until it went out of site. As a side note, I had no trouble at all getting Venus to come into focus on my digital camera, an Olympus C2100 UZ. I am in the process of transferring the images to my computer for further analysis.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924

A boomerang hovers in the sky over Bakersfield;2010-12-01 17:30:00;1 hour;A boomerang hovers in the sky over Bakersfield On my way to college on Dec. 1, 2010 at approx. 5:30 p.m., off the 204 freeway between Buck Owen’s Blvd. and F Street we saw a boomerang shaped object with six round very bright lights under it.  It hovered the entire time we were traveling the freeway about four minutes. My wife dropped me off at the college and proceeded to the annual AIDS vigil downtown, perhaps three to four miles from where we originally saw the space craft.  During the ceremony she noticed it glide by and disappear. We both found it to be quite strange and different from anything we had ever seen before.  We looked in the paper and watched the local news to see if there were any references to it.  There was nothing mentioned that we could find.  Maybe if we placed an article in the paper we would bring forth more witnesses that observed this phenomenon in the sky. I am a bookkeeper and college student and my wife is an educational instructor, we are both in our forties.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924

At firs;2012-03-26 18:20:00;12 minutes;Driving northbound on highway 99 outside of Bakersfield CA.  Just pass 7th standard road exit.  Saw bright light over freeway.   At first did not think anything.  But then as I drove north on the freeway, I noticed the light did not move and remain bright.  The sun was still out.  Clear day no clouds.  A few minutes into the drive, maybe 10 miles out of Bakersfield.  I noticed the bright light was still above the freeway and at that time I asked my son, who was in the passenger seat if he saw the bright light.  He stated he had been looking at it for some time now and notice it had not moved.  My younger son who was in the back seat sat forward to see and stated that the light appeared to be hovering over the freeway 99.  We kept looking at the bright light and then as we got closed, noticed now two bright lights and still hovering.  At that point my sons said what is it.  It is not a plane or helicopter.  It is too low and it is not moving.  It appear to be ho! vering over a pass.  I started to slow down to 50 miles and kept looking at the light and notice the cars behind me also slowed down.  As I drove near the upcoming pass,it appeared to be right above the freeway pass. I notice the object was a dull grey with two bright lights and no sound.  My son tried to get a photo with his phone but was not able.  I slowed down to see the object which now was on my right side and hovering over an orchard off the freeway just before the exit.  We were maybe 8 minutes from the Lerdo exit towards Shafter.  We tried to see what it was.  We exited and looked towards my right side above the trees.  As we looked back, it was gone.  No noise.  It hovered for a good 12 minutes over the freeway.  First one big white bright light and then two bright lights, It looked like boom-a-rang shape.  Grey in color with bright lights on the ends.  We could not identify the object.  It was not an airplane.  Do not believe an airplane can stay in one spot for t! hat long. Dark grey object hovering a few feet above freeway 9! 9.

We were coming home from an evening out.  My husband got out at the corner from car to get mail.;2015-10-16 21:20:00;10-15 minutes;We were coming home from an evening out.  My husband got out at the corner from car to get mail.  He started commenting and I couldn’t hear him.  He finally told me to get out of car and look.  I looked up and told him it was stars.  A lot of beautiful bright stars!  He said, “No, it’s not right.”  I looked further and realized the formation in the direction was all wrong.  Then I noticed along with him that they were moving.   We tried calling a news station, and the first one we called wasn’t really interested.  The weather man was off for the evening.  So we took some pictures and tried to get video but it was too high up to get any great footage.  They are tiny dots by this point.  They started to the west of us, moved overhead, off to East, then North-West, till we could no longer see them. Our location was Calle Alisos, just West of Stockdale Hwy., and Jenkins Rd., Bakersfield, CA 93314.  The objects were in a star-like formation, almost like one of the dipper’s.  Bright white like stars, were moving very slowly at first.  So slow, you almost missed the movement, then began moving seemingly faster, from East to West, then North-West, until out of sight.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924

Cluster of lights which changed colors and a group of red lights that seemed to be targets.;2019-07-23 03:30:00;>2 hours;Cluster of lights which changed colors and a group of red lights that seemed to be targets. d openly talked about a Space Military possibly be already created and what I saw was it in Practice?  This was My theory at least after thinking about it for two days  I do not do drugs have not even had a aspirin in 20 years  Do not drink and I am not a Nut job.  But what I saw is driving me crazy trying to understand what I saw and Hope it being reported to you will help You Guys figure it out and maybe one day you can say what it was to the Public in General I will be watching for a answer.In looking at the questions Below May I add these lights were in outer Space not that close to Earth Possibly Hundred or Thousand of Miles away they were mostly a group of Light points and the same for the red Lights.  so I had no way of telling How really big they were.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
red/orange, bell shaped object observed over Bakersfield Ca. on the 4th of July!;2020-07-04 21:54:00;50 seconds;red/orange, bell shaped object observed over Bakersfield Ca. on the 4th of July! I've been a school bus driver for 26 years and on the 4th of July 2020 ,I was watching the the aerial fire works (which are illegal in California) when a bell shaped object came in to view approximately 300 feet or so above the ground over Bakersfield, Ca.  It hovered like it was in observance of what was going on.  The object was fully illuminated in a dull red/orange color, with no flashing lights and no sound. I grabbed my binoculars for a closer look and was in awe of what I was seeing.  It then drifted toward the east then zipped out of sight, only to return once again a few seconds later and hovered for approximately 50 seconds, then again drifted toward the east and zipped out of sight again.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Blobs that look like birds flying real fast;2020-10-22 20:50:00;4 minutes;Blobs that look like birds flying real fast In north Bakersfield east of Chester Ave there was a fuzzy blob in the sky moving straight south about 10 minutes to 9 pm.  It was totally silent. It looked like it was at a couple thousand feet and moving about 200 mph.  It could have been an airplane flying with no lights on or a huge mechanical bird.  There was no indication of anything in that area on Flightradar.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
