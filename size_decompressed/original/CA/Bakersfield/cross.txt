I'll do my best here. At aproximately 9:00 PM Pacific, a business partner and I were travleing west on Stockdale Hwy just before Montclair, when my partner said what is that and I said what, he pointed to the sky to the West just dew north and I said it was an airplane and I was trying to get a better look and still drive. I was thinking what is this thing doing, there is no airport any where close and this thing was like hovering around what I thougt to be 200-300 feet high it set there probably around maybe five seconds and it began to turn North we turned right immediatley and tried to follow it(It did not just disapear but it accelerated very quickly from hovering, also it was like it did not hardly tilt to make its turn)at this point we could make out the shape pretty good. If you could picture one of those little airplanes that have the big wing in the back that look like they fly backwards like a craft with three fusolages but maybe even like one of those three sided bumerangs the nerf type. It seemed to be around the size of a McDonald Douglas Super 80 It had bright white lights all the way around all three sides like landing lights and one red rotating light on what I call the back around 10-15 total lights(all three sides looked the MDS80 size. Rather large to be hovering with no audible noise) and it like started flying right over the neighborhood not fast at all kind of slowly, continueing its turn to the North that ended it up heading more West than North we followed it through the neighborhood for as long as we could see it, which was about 15 seconds we never seen it go higher but it like just disapeared, we even drove to a clear spot on Easton Drive which is about a mile north of Stockdale Hwy and could see to the North and the West clearly but it was no where to be seen.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
