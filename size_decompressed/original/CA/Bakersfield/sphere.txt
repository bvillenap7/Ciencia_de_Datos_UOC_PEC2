sphere flying over traffic congestion in Bakersfield Ca January 05;2005-01-07 08:03:00;3 minutes;sphere flying over traffic congestion in Bakersfield Ca January 05 I was traveling to the gym for a morning workout at 8:00 am on Rosedale highway heading east and traffic was heavy. I spotted a flying object which I thought was a helicopter flying at about 1,000 feet elevation. It seemed to be gaining speed and as it neared my vicinity, I was trying to see the blades or the tail of the craft. It was about 1/2 mile away and at 1,000 feet. Thinking it was a helicopter, I thought that it must be on a heading for some crime that occured in our area. But, it didn't slow down. It was picking up speed and then turned northwest and as it did, I could see that it had no wings, tail, or blades. It was shaped like the front of a helicopter and on the back were 3 large round purple sphere. It made no noise and seemed to just glide along. Then, I thought it might be a weather balloon. But, the direction of the winds were easterly at 30 miles per hour due to a rain storm earlier in the am. It was heading against the direction of the wind. It gained altitude about 500 feet and maintained its speed north west. There was no jet trail, or sound of it moving. It was if it was scouting for something or sightseeing our city and the traffic.  I took several pictures with my throwaway camera. They have been developed and you can see a small object in the distance in each photo. But, because I used a cheap camera, anything more than a 1,000 feet away is just a spot.  I called the airport radar tower. They didn't want to say anthing about it.  I called the paper, they just sd send an email and copy of the pic. Oh well, I did see other people in thier cars staring at it. As we were stopped at red light for at least 1 minute. I pulled over and took the pics.If there is anybody else that saw the object this morning. Maybe you also took a  photo.  email me at ((e-address deleted));35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
witnessed a white spherical object zip downward across the sky at an 80 degree angle.;2005-07-19 01:30:00;3 sec.;witnessed a white spherical object zip downward across the sky at an 80 degree angle. We (my co-worker and i) were driving eastbound when we saw a spherical object in the early morning sky. it moved like a falling star but it was about the size of the full moon while its on the horizon. (much to big to be a meteorite) the object quickly disappeared from view. it fell at about an 80 degree angle. the light that it gave off was a Soft white light.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Friend and I saw a planet or moon.  Reddish yellow and craters. Half showing in west,  20 times size of moon half showing with horizon.;2006-01-29 20:00:00;prolonged;Friend and I saw a planet or moon.  Reddish yellow and craters. Half showing in west,  20 times size of moon half showing with horizon. I could not cut and paste on my computer.  My friend and I were going about 6 blocks away to Lowes.  When we turned West on Panama Lane, I said, &quotDo you see what I see?&quot My friend said, Yes.   It looked bright and reddish yellow with craters.  I thought it was Mars and then the moon.   It wasn't far from us.  It was about 30 times the size of the moon.  It seemed as though it would collide into Earth.  (It was that close)  We could see half as it was in the horizon like the sun going down.  I was so busy and figured that I would here about it from TV or radio or newspaper.   I was so busy that I didn't even try to here from the media the next day.   So many people were driving.  I should have flagged people down or ran back to get my camera.   It bothers me that I don't hear about anyone seeing this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
3 highly metallic, highly reflective spheres moving rapidly together, then quickly ascending out of sight;2006-05-29 12:00:00;1 to 2 minutes;3 highly metallic, highly reflective spheres moving rapidly together, then quickly ascending out of sight Three metallic (highly reflective) spheres.  They also looked like they could have been pairs of spheres attached to each other.  Three of these moving very quickly, and I saw them for around one minute.  There had been a cloud stream-producing aircraft to the north of these objects moments before they appeared.  At first I saw one, then almost immediately two others appeared.  Then within a minute, they had moved farther southeast and higher into the sky until I could just barely see one of them, then I could not see them at all.  By the time I took photos, only one was visible to me (barely), and it did not show up on my digital camera photos.  Also, the objects seemed to be silent.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Bright round orange object observed above above northern horizon.;2006-12-28 17:51:00;6 minutes;Bright round orange object observed above above northern horizon. Large circular orange colored object observed about 45 degrees above almost due north horizon (a few degrees west of north). Location observed from was Bakersfield, California location Longitude -118.974 latitude 35.389.  Time of observation was about 3 minutes before and 3 minutes after the time I took two pictures of the object at about 5:51pm on Thursday, December 28, 2006.  The pictures are not worth any detail other than to document the time the object was being viewed. There were two other viewers at my location that confirmed the object(s).  Size of object increased in magnitude from about that of a bright Venus to about twice that of a bright Venus in a period of about 5 minutes.  I don't know how long the object was in the sky before I first observed it but a few minutes after first observing it - two smaller orange objects fell away from the larger object appearing to fall straight down and away to the north from the larger object of which they fainted out disappearing at which time the larger object started to faint away also and completely disappeared also.  Note that the larger object appeared mainly stationary with a very small drift downwards - so it must have been coming straight towards our location.  I assume the object to be the debris of some man made space object such as a satellite falling back to earth.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924

round spinning;2019-12-17 05:30:00;5 minutes;round spinning Hi Last week on the 17th of December I was in my back yard trying to finish up some yard work before the darkness set in it was probably around 530-600 when I happen to look up and notice an object in the sky.  I star gaze every night and know exactly where every star in the sky sits, and know what airplanes look like when they fly overhead, and this was not a normal star or an aircraft. I have a video  that I recorded of the object and it is clear to see this object is not what one can call normal.  It appears to be round and spinning. My husband and I both observed the object for about 5 min before it disappeared. I live in Bakersfield Ca, and this is not the first time my husband and I have witnessed an object such as this. The event prior to this one happened in San Simeon as we were driving back from Morro Bay to our hotel on Hwy 1 an object similar in appearance popped into existence and shown very bight for about a minute and disappeared just like it appeared.  Unfortunately, I was driving and could not video this event. I am not completely positive of the exact date, but it did happen in February of this year.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Floating orange lights that showed up, moved across the sky and disappeared within 3 minutes.;2021-04-10 20:10:00;3 minutes;Floating orange lights that showed up, moved across the sky and disappeared within 3 minutes. We looked an we saw glowing orange lights floating in the night sky, with no discernible fornation. They moved at the speed of balloon bit they were larger than balloons and we would not have been able to see ballons at this time of night. After a few minutes the lights just faded away. Even our two dogs stopped playing long enough to watch this happen.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
