Orange glowing fireball with structures radiating from the light source;1998-12-16 23:18:00;2 minutes;Orange glowing fireball with structures radiating from the light source I witnessed a glowing object hover/float silently in the air.  It appeared to be some kind of glowing fireball against the night sky.  It left no trails.  It appeared to have arms radiating from its center to other spherical shapes much like a jack (like ball and jack kids game piece).  I watched the object extiguish its glow.  For a couple seconds after that I could see the jack shape against the night sky.  It looked metallic.  I was driving south on hwy 99 near the California Avenue exit in Bakersfield, CA.  I watched the object as I exited the freeway and had enough time to pull over and get out of the car to observe.  Approximately two minutes had passed since I had made eye contact with the object.  The skies were clear.  I am a college graduate. I work as a commercial producer at a radio station.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
I observed what I believed to be a meteor, however I watched it cross the entire sky for about 90 seconds.;2000-06-27 21:50:00;90 seconds;I observed what I believed to be a meteor, however I watched it cross the entire sky for about 90 seconds. On June 27, at approximately 2150 hours, I saw what I believe was a falling star in the western sky at about 30-35 degrees. As I watched it, it travelled east across the sky until it was beyond the eastern horizon. The event lasted about 90 seconds, allowing me time to get binoculars from the trunk of my car and watch it travel. The altitude remained constant throughout my observation as did the object's speed. The object appeared to be very far away, orange in color, with a tail. The object appeared to be very hot or burning because as I looked at it through the binoculars it appeared to have smaller pieces falling from the tail and they too would create a tail, but they would drop in altitude. A co-worker of mine also witnesses the object, as did my neighbor, who was outside at the same time as me. My co-worker thought it was something from Vandenberg AFB, but I have never seen anything from there travel inland.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Mars.  PD))  Bright Star changes direction at high speeds.;2005-10-12 00:00:00;2 + hours;Bright Star changes direction at high speeds I live in Bakersfield CA and i was wondering if anyone saw anything weird in the eastern skies on the 12th of this month.  I saw what seemed to be a BRIGHT orange star, at first.  Then it started to travel what looked like straight down, (resembling a meteor or asteroid) and had a tail or vapor trail.   It made some strange 90 degree turns at high rates of speed and continued this behavior for at least two hours.  It looked like it was it was somewhere around Edwards AFB which makes me just a little skeptical but still i dont know of a human occupied craft that could perform such maneuvers.  Please right me back with a response or suggestion on what this might be.  Thank you  Cwalkwthme@aol.com     (P.S.--Shortly after first observing the object military aircraft were seen flying directly over my house, my GF and I both observed this even for about 2 hours) ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Mars.

I WAS MOVED FROM MY BED TO THOUSANDS OF FEET ABOVE MY BED- GOING THROUGH THE CEILING OF MY ROOM.  IT WAS LIKE IT WAS TRANSPARENT. I COULD SEE SEVERAL RED LIGHTS MOVING BACK AND FORTH AS I WAS BEING TRANSPORTED UP THERE.  I FELT THEM TOUCHING ME.. AND I COULD HEAR NOISES LIKE CLATTER SOUNDS... I COULD NOT MOVE TO MAKE ANY SOUNDS FROM MY MOUTH. I AM STILL SCARED. WHEN I AWOKE..  I REMEMBERED EVERYTHING.. BUT WITHIN A FEW HOURS MY BRAIN WAS CLOUDED.  THE STRANGE THING ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING IS MY FRIEND AND HIS NEIGHBORS, EIGHT OF THEM SEEN THINGS IN THE SKY AROUND THE SAME TIME- HOWEVER THEY WERE ABOUT 75 MILES SOUTH OF ME.  I WAS UNAWARE OF THIS UNTIL THE NEXT DAY- WHEN MY FRIEND SAID HE AND 8 OF HIS FRIENDS SEEN A STRANGE LIGHT SHOW IN THE NIGHT- AND IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Saw an orange light with flame like trail completely silent traveling from north to south headed toward Los Angeles.;2015-06-17 21:00:00;5 minutes;Saw an orange light with flame like trail completely silent traveling from north to south headed toward Los Angeles At the above listed date and time, I was walking into my kitchen to go out in the back yard, and could see an orange ball of light, with just a small tail behind it (like flames coming out of the back).  It was coming from the north, going south, and I tried taking a picture of it, but couldn't focus my iPhone.   I want to say it slowed when it was right overhead, but I can't be certain.  It seemed like maybe it wasn't going at a high rate of speed at all.  It was completely silent and there were no flashing lights at all.   I watched it until I couldn't see it anymore, and if it continued in the way it was going, it would be going over the Grapevine into LA with Edwards Air Force Base off to the east.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
