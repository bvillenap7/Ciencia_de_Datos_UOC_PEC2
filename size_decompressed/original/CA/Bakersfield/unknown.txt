Electrical interference (TV/lights), massive, fast-moving shadow covering whole yard and more. Silent.;1998-07-13 15:38:00;3-5 seconds;Electrical interference (TV/lights), massive, fast-moving shadow covering whole yard and more. Silent. At home that afternoon my brother and I were disturbed by some electrical interference. Our flourescent and incandescent lights dimmed, our TV displayed odd patterns, and the A/C stopped for a moment. I looked outside into the yard to see a gigantic shadow with a curved leading edge race across the ground outside in the backyard. I ran outside to see if I could see anything but there was nothing visible (our yard is partly covered by trees). We heard no sounds out of the ordinary, felt no motion, and do not live in a flight path (in fact, the shadow moved the wrong direction for our local aiport's typical takeoff or landing routes). The shadow moved an an incredible speed. As it passed over the whole yard became dark. Please contact me if & only if this corroborates other reports. Thank you for your time.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Observed two lights moving fast and near miss to aircraft;2002-05-28 21:15:00;20 secs;Observed two lights moving fast and near miss to aircraft While sitting on my back porch, I observed a single light with the brightness equal to that of Jupiter on a southwest to northeast track. The light was a blue-white light, like a star or planet. There was no sound. I followed the light until it was obscured from view by trees. Compared to commercial aircraft that fly over my house, on a southeast to northwest track normally, this object appeared to fly about twice as fast. Also, there was no strobe activity, and it seemed to be lower in altitude than commercial aircraft that fly over. Approximately 10 minutes later, I observed a commercial aircraft on a northwest to southeast track, with strobes flashing. What appeared to be above, and on a perpendicular track, was a single light similar to the one I saw earlier, only not as bright. The dim light actually intersected the path of the commercial craft, but it seemed at a higher altitude. I also followed this light until it was obscured by trees.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
An eractic object with three bright white lights traveling with traffic over I-5 in the middle of California;2003-08-16 21:45:00;3-5 minutes;An eractic object with three bright white lights traveling with traffic over I-5 in the middle of California My wife, my parents and I were driving down I-5 towards LA in heavy traffic traveling about 65 miles per hour.  Ahead of us the traffic started slowing down.  All of a sudden three lights popped over the field to the east of us and swooped overhead.  We were all looking at this object (I say an object because the lights seemed fixed to something but we couldn't see any structure - once I thought I saw a long pole-like boom heading to one of the lights, but I can't be sure) as we, it and the rest of the traffic moved south at 45-50 miles per hour.  It bounced up and down, looked like it landed in a field to the west of us, then zoomed back over the interstate.  At first I thought it was a crop duster, although it was very dark to be spraying.  But the object didn't follow any field pattern I know of, nor did I see any cloud of pesticide ejected from the object which I believe would leave a haze that would fog the lights from the farm houses in the distance.  Those lights stayed crystal clear.  Also, the object would speed up ahead of us then return along the interstate.  My wife thought it might be a small plane or ultrlight in distress, but the object didn't have any colored wing lights, just three very intense white beams one of which disappeared every so often (I think the bulk of the object blocked the far light at these times, but I have no special reason to think so).  The object stayed around the highway for a few minutes, then rushed off to the east.  It seemed to have set down in a field about 1/4 mile behind us.  As I was in the backseat, I kept watching it wondering what it might be.  It appear once more well behind our car and moved west over the interstate a minute or so later.  We were well away from it I could only see the lights as dots.  None of us heard any noise although we could easily hear car engines and crickets (as we discovered later) while moving at speed.  The radio wasn't on.  When I asked what size they thought the object was, three of us felt the craft couldn't have been more than 20 feet long (my wife and mother compared it to the size of a large car).  My father thought it was relatively large.  (As an amateur astronomer, I know that appearent dimensions get funny at night.  So I gave my parents a test to help them visualize the size of the object (my wife already knows this test).  I asked them to compare the object to the full moon.  Then I asked them which coin is roughly the size of the full moon when held at arm's length.  My mom thought the object was much larger than the full moon, say about 8 to ten disks wide, and correctly said a dime is roughly the disk of the moon.  My father didn't give me an estimation, but incorrectly believed a quarter matches the appearent diameter of the moon.)  We figured the object never went very high above us and estimated the closest approach to be about 500 feet to the west and less than 100 feet above from the appearent height of the power lines running along the highway and the height of the crops it disappeared into.  My wife and I are teachers (she's a pre-school teacher and head after-school teacher I'm a middle school science and math teacher).  My mother just retired from teaching 5th grade for 37 years.  My dad retired from brokering steel.  I noted the time from the clock radio in the car and the inital distance from a mileage sign to Bakersfield.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Object was flashing orange/white lights and moving in circles very slowly and vanished;2004-05-06 12:59:00;6 Minutes;Object was flashing orange/white lights and moving in circles very slowly and vanished I was looking outside of my bedroom window waiting for the cab to arrive. As I waited I looked up into the sky and seconds later there was like a circle-shaped object in the sky flashing red/orange and white lights. I watched it for a few minutes longer and it seemed to move from right to left and then back again. After about 6 minutes or so, the lights faded into the sky and disappeared.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
While driving to work at 6:30 am I observed a jet trail streaking across the sky at a very fast rate. what appeared to be faster than m;2005-09-27 06:30:00;10 minutes;While driving to work at 6:30 am I observed a jet trail streaking across the sky at a very fast rate. what appeared to be faster than most airplanes.  The distance of the object was at least 40 miles east. but the jet trail reflected the craft going fast in a straight line then turning abrubtly at a 90 degree angle with out curving out as planes must do in order to prevent black out and being ripped apart. this craft just went right then traveled upward and then turned left angled with a curve down to where the jet trail dispeared. This happened again and I got my camera out to take a picture. I was able to get a shot of the jet trail just when the craft moved after taking a right turn again sharply at 90 degrees. then it did the same movement and curved left and down and dispeared. 30 seconds later it performed the same procedure.  I have one eyewitness that also saw the event while driving to work in the same direction. weather was clear skies.  the area that the craft moved may have been in the edwards airforce base area. where they test aircraft. but this must be a very advanced vehicle.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
I-5 UFO Sighting appox 40 miles north of Bakersfield;2008-08-14 02:00:00;1 minute;I-5 UFO Sighting appox 40 miles north of Bakersfield My parents and I were driving north on Highway 5 and saw what seemed to be an extremely low flying aircraft.  It was so low to the overpass we were approaching that it looked like it was going to land there.  I could not make out any distinct shape of the craft.  I thought it was a plane at first because of blinking white and red lights like those normally seen on a plane, but the way it was moving seemed inconsistent the capabilities of a normal airplane.  It seemed to disappear for a moment then we saw it over the fields to our right.  The fields were full of trees (what I assume were nut trees) of similar shape and size.  Suddenly the field lit up and it seemed that the craft was down amongst the trees.  It got dark again and we then saw the craft behind us.  It circled around again to the overpass, and although most of the time the craft was dark, there were three lights that turned on for a few moments and then were extinguished.  I continued to watch for the craft out the rear car window....saw the blinking lights for about 30 seconds then got out of range.  In hindsight, we should have stopped the car for a better look, but we were on a long drive from Phoenix and anxious to get home.  We did not hear any sound coming from the craft, however our car windows were rolled up. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Red object displaying bizarre flight patterns before shooting directly upwards into space;2012-11-09 19:40:00;9 minutes;Red object displaying bizarre flight patterns before shooting directly upwards into space While smoking a cigarette, I looked up into the sky and noticed an object moving at a far higher altitude than any plane I have seen.  The object, which appeared red to the best of my ability of sight, moved backwards, foward, sideways, then in a zig zag pattern.  Due to recent numerous similar events, I was convinced the object was far from any flight capable object I had ever seen.  When the object changed course west, it stopped near a star and the star began glowing brighter as did the flying object.  The object flew east at incredible speed, immediatly stopped, and flew upwards towards space in a similar fashion as a rocket ship, directly upwards.  As it was on its path towards space , the clouds behind it became thicker and formed behind the object, covering any way to continue viewing it.  Throughout it's flight patterns, it consistently flew behind clouds near the shining star.  I highly stress to inform this is not the first time I have seen an object mane! uver such bizarre flight patterns and shoot directly into space, seeming to somehow each time influence cloud patterns.

Lighthouse rotating light in the sky.;2015-07-17 23:00:00;1 minutes;Lighthouse rotating light in the sky. this craft was moving very slowly it was a cloudless evening and this started as a pinhole size light and got larger and appeared as though it was behind a fog like blurry.  It looked like a very slow moving light house light in a fog rotating very slowly.   It then started to shrink in size again, until it was no longer visible.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Saw a craft shoot out a blue beam across the sky.;2015-11-07 09:30:00;10 minutes;Saw a craft shoot out a blue beam across the sky. I was going outside to my car when I thought a helicopter was shining a light above me.  I looked up confused because I didn't hear any sound.  All of a sudden, this craft opens with a red light on the back, and a really bright light in the middle.  I was facing south west.  It was directly above me when it shot out this massive ray of blue light.  It then disappeared in a moment, but the blue beam stayed fixed in the sky for about an hour.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Plane trailing behind gray smoke coming from unseen object.;2016-01-14 13:50:00;5 minutes;Plane trailing behind gray smoke coming from unseen object. I saw an airplane traveling southeast towards the mountains just south of Bakersfield, CA.  In front of the plane was a smoky grey area.  It looked like it could be exhaust from a craft but I could not see any other aircraft in front of the plane.  It looked like the plane was following this grey cloudy formation, almost looked like something was cloaked that created this grey funnel.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
