Disppeared into thin air. 4 or 5 aircrafts about 1 mile ahead of me while driving.  They looked like they were goin to land but would just do a 180 and fly upward and disappear into thin air.  They were doing things any earthly aircraft can't do. (my dad is a pilot- i'm pretty familiar)  Then it was as if they saw us- we were on I-5 heading south and one appeared on the left side of us on the other side of the freeway and was going the same speed as us (75-80 mph). It was at the same height as our small truck- maybe a few feet higher. It started swaying from side to side like it was going to crash.  It stayed with us for about one minute and then dove down into the corn field and completely disappeared.  We kept looking back and never saw it or any others again.  It looked like a long cigar with a white and I believe a green light on each end pointing forward (i guess they can't see in the dark:-) ).  They were about 50 ft. long.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924

Moving unnaturally, undirectionally through the sky at a controlled speed Two of us were sitting on a trampoline in my backyard when my dog ran to the east corner of the yard and barked once, which caught our attention.  When she ran back to us, we noticed a bright object to the east in the sky.  It looked like a planet, but brighter, and vertically shaped.  It was moving at a constant, controlled speed, faster than a plane yet incredibly slower than a shooting star or a meteor.  There were no flashing lights and no tail, only one solid white light.  It was moving from south to north, first at a downward curve, before it moved closer to us which we were able to notice by its increasing size, and then once more at a downward curve moving north before it disappeared behind trees.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Extraordinary sighting of cigar shape craft over Bakersfield.;2014-07-02 03:14:00;45 minutes;Extraordinary sighting of cigar shape craft over Bakersfield. Past three years have seen many things in the skies.  Yet nothing I feel confident enough to say is a ufo.  Until the morning of July 2, 2014, approximately at 3:14 am. What I saw is something I have never seen before.  It was so amazing it sent chills down my spine.  As real and dramatic as my experience was to me.  I was hesitant to make a report.  I changed my mind because when I arrived at home and turned on the news like every other day.  One of the first segments was a segment on ufo sightings.  Followed by a segment about the rocket luanch the night before.  I felt that the local news was trying to discredit what was clearly a dramatic sighting.  That meant I was not the only one to see it.  I wanted to go ahead and report my sighting and hopefully find out if there are more reports in my area. At 3:14 a.m., I noticed a bright red Orange ball of light coming in to visibility.  Much like an approaching plane that is going to soon land.  Then it came to complete stop.  This was extremely bright orange red light about the height that police helicopters fly in a city.  Then it made what look like a right turn yet when it did this, it went from being a ball of light.  To what seemed to me to be a long cigar shape with three lights in the middle...orange, red, orange.  Then it slowly moved in what I can only described as a snake slithering.  Then it slowly faded to a flashing light.  That stayed stationary for about another 45 minutes.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
