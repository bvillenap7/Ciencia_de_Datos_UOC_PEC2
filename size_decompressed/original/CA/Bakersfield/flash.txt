UFO FLYING OVER RACEWAY IN CA.;2010-03-27 13:00:00;2 SECONDS;UFO FLYING OVER RACEWAY IN CA Ok...I'm not an expert at all but I took this video back on March 27th 2010 at Famoso Raceway near Bakersfield CA.. It's footage of a dragster racing at 236 MPH.  As fast as that is, that isn't the interesting thing about this video.  What is interesting is at the end of the video is what appears to be a UFO flying very fast (perhaps faster than the human eye can see)into the upper right hand side of the frame.  I didn't notice this until a few months ago when I was reviewing this footage. If you slow it down you can see what appears to be some kind of glowing thrust.  It's at the end of the video about 28 seconds into it. Had I noticed this at the time I took the footage   I would've kept the camera rolling. Please let me know what you think.  I apologize for the F-bomb that I made just before the footage end.  It was aimed at just how fast this car was going and not at the UFO that I didn't know was there until now.  I'm also sorry that the advertisements pop in ju! st about at the very end and make it so that you can't view the very end.  I don't know how to fix it so that doesn't happen.   I sent video footage..not sure if you will be able to view however because I'm not very good at using the video editor.  I just trimmed the video down to the last few seconds but for some reason I don't know how to save it in a format I can e-mail and have the receiver view it. here's the your tube version:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhi98ew0rLk;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
Bright Blue light flashed in sky, left small smoke puff. No sound.;2021-07-28 23:13:00;2 seconds;Bright Blue light flashed in sky, left small smoke puff. No sound. Sitting outside in Northwest Bakersfield, clear night, just happened to look up as an intense bright blue light in the sky about 200 yards up, flashed, burned out and left a small puff of smoke behind, which quickly dissipated. Absolutely no sound before, during or after flash. Initial thought was that it may have been a strange firework, or unusual rocket. But that theory was not plausible, being as no sound proceeded or accompanied it. It may have also been witnessed by an aircraft traveling south but at incredibly high altitude.;35.3759480132446;-119.058406594924
