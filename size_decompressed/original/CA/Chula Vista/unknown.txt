((HOAX??))  Lights that moved abnormaly.;2016-02-28 20:05:00;5;Lights that moved abnormaly. I saw two what looked like two orange airplane lights coming toward me as I was looking at the stars.  Nothing special until they stopped.  Then they rotated and started moving upward.  I whistled and yelled at my friends to come see what I was seeing.   Once they came to my back yard all they could say was onions left shoulder looked orange VS. BRIGHT.  One them said that us seed to be moving for a split second but then lost the movement I am not a nut I was shocked when what I thought was a plane stopped and started rotating and moving away with great speed.

Multiple orange lights falling from the sky in a spiral and disappearing.  ((NUFORC Note:  USN parachutists reported in area.  PD));2018-10-12 18:45:00;5 minute;Multiple orange lights falling from the sky in a spiral and disappearing At 6:00 we were waiting for our frend to leave a basketball practice.  While waiting we noticed multiple burning red-orange lights spiraling down to the ground west of our position.  While watching we recognized that they couldnâ€™t possibly be planes because thay were slowly falling leaving behind a small trail of light.  They intermittently came out of view and more joined in falling.  We noticed this happening at 6:44 and watched for a minute, and then i used my phone to film the last remaining one falling behind the trees.  We moved to get a better view by car and saw a flash of light on the horizon.  By the time we got to the to of the hill the lights were gone.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
