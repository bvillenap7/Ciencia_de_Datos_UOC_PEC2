Blimp shaped craft floating over I805  January 21, 1981, 5pm.;1981-01-21 17:00:00;5 minutes;Blimp shaped craft floating over I805  January 21, 1981 5pm I was 31 years old at the time , single and working as a technician for At&t. On January  21, 1981 I was on my way to a wedding in Bonita, California called the Chapel of the Roses.  I was coming from west Chula Vista.  I  came down E St. heading east and got lost.  I grew up there so I was surprised that i was lost. In those days Bonita still had farmland up in the hills and I  found myself near one and on a dirt road with a great view overlooking  I805 looking west.  It was still light with little  clouds.  I saw the Goodyear Blimp over the freeway which wasn't unusual, although this one had  lights covering the ENTIRE body, not just a screened area.  The lights moved clockwise together vertically, row by row. I was actually enjoying watching it just floating over the freeway very slowly and calmly going in and out of small clouds and not too high. Blimp height, just like a blimp. While I was watching this and thinking how I hadn't ever seen a blimp like this, it suddenly took off upward sooo fast leaving a trail toward the south.  My hair stood on end.  I realized it was dark now and shook all the way down the hill. I found the Chapel and was still shaking when I told my friends.  No one believed me. I did report it to a UFO reporting sight where you could call in the sighting.  The guy who took my report said there were no other reports in that area that night.  I no longer remember what reporting entity it was but it was in Washington State.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
Black, shaped like a clover, slowly rotating, surrounded by what looked like heat waves.;2000-07-21 18:00:00;3 min;Black, shaped like a clover, slowly rotating, surrounded by what looked like heat waves. I was standing out by my pool and looking out over the city towards the ocean. I live some what on a hill. In the distance I noticed a black object coming in my direction, I continued watching the object for a while. At first I thought it was a helicopter, but I did not hear any noise. I continued to watch the object and it appeared to be shaped some what like a three leaf clover, as I was watching it, the object appeared to rotate a quarter of a turn every once in a while it also appeared to have some type of visual disturbance around it, like heat waves or a mirage. I continued to watch it and it started to accend, as it was accending it did not appear like the three leaf clover shape, but rather just a round object. it continued to rise into the sky until I could not percieve it any longer.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
