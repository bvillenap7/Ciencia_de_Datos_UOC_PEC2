Silver disc object over Mexican airspace;2015-07-29 13:30:00;2 minutes;silver disc object over Mexican airspace My friend and i were leaving his house, only a few miles away from the US/Mexico border.  I looked out over Mexico as we were driving down the street and saw a large silver object just hovering over what i presume to be the Tijuana area.  We stopped the car and looked, my friend wrote it off as a large bird. Upon resuming our drive, while i kept an eye on the object.  After passing a tree, the skies were clear.  I leaned out the window to look in all directions, but the object was gone. The object appeared to be disc shaped, with a definite metallic color and shine to it.  To me, it appeared silver.  I've end was lighter, almost white against the sky, and the usually hazy air was clean around the object.  It was hovering in an area i have never seen any aircraft in before.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
