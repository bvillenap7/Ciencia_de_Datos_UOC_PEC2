Three white diamond shaped objects floating slowly high up in the sky over the 805 freeway.;2014-06-14 18:00:00;20 minutes;Three white diamond shaped objects floating slowly high up in the sky over the 805 freeway. I noticed something in the sky (clear blue sky with some faint scattered wispy white clouds lower on the horizon) out my big second story window that faces east at approximately 6:10 PM.  I thought at first it was a small airplane pulling a banner but the shape and movement was wrong.  Then I thought it might be a parachute but it was not that.  There were two objects, a larger and a smaller one, it was like the smaller one was being towed by the larger, both very high up in the sky up over the 805 freeway. Both were kind of floating, moving slowly yet steadily.  Maybe diamond or triangle shaped, if I had binoculars I might've been able to see more detail.  It seemed almost like a kite type of a floating or debris of something that caught the wind but they were not kites.  I looked out my other bedroom window that faces south and there was a larger one that was slightly closer yet still high up in the sky.  It was similar to the other objects but I just couldn't make out what it was. I had never seen such objects in the sky before, they weren't planes.  I watched the third object until it disappeared in the blue sky. I went back to my east window and the two original objects were gone.  I should note that I could see airplane traffic in the distance to the north-east, planes travel a set path to land at Lindbergh Field and I could easily see even from a far distance they were planes.  The objects I saw were not the same.  Could not identify them as anything specific.  I thought maybe I could see a very faint aura around the two in the east but it might've been the light or my eyes adjusting.

Experienced what looked like a string of diamonds in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Cluster of Starlink satellites.  PD));2019-11-11 18:00:00;2-4 minutes;Experienced what looked like a string of diamonds in the sky Just after arriving home I looked up in the sky and noticed what looked like a string of lights moving in a southerly direction, some of the lights were brighter than others. This line was not a perfectly straight line, it kind of reminded me of a sting of birds and how their line would be a little random, and not looked like it had a purpose. I have a watch that has a compass in it and that is how I knew which way they were traveling. The logical person in me kept looking for an explanation. Eventually the lights went dimmer due to the clouds in the area. It is the closest thing I've experienced with out explanation. Very interesting, This night has a Very Full moon, that had just risen in the east. The moon was not in the area where the lights were seen;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
