East Chula Vista, CA Friday, November 25, 2011 at approximately 7:30PM while observing the night sky for meteors my brother in law pointed out a triangular shaped craft moving from west to east.  A total of four of us immediately looked to see the approximately 1,000 foot wide equilateral triangle with three white lights traveling at an estimated 5,000 miles per hour directly overhead.  It took approximately 5 second for the craft to travel the entire horizon from east west direction before disappearing from sight.  There was no noise.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623

I looked up at them and saw a triangle shaped object.  It was, at most, 300 feet in the air.  There were bright lights on the underside and it was completely silent.   It flew over my house from the west, heading east.  I tried to get a picture, but by the time my camera app opened it was too far away to see anything on the camera.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
