It was glowing so much that I couldn’t tell what kind of shape the object was for most of the encounter. What I found kind of odd though was that as I I’m staring at this glowing object, there was another aircraft of some sort not far behind it (Keep in mind the sun has gone down) . The 2nd object blended in with the night sky so good that if it wasn’t for the red flashing light that this craft had, I wouldn’t have been able to see it at all.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
