V Shaped Formation of White,Cross-like Objects Observed in Chula Vista, California;2002-08-03 13:05:00;10-12 min;V Shaped Formation of White,Cross-like Objects Observed in Chula Vista, California I observed a V shaped formation of cross shaped objects in the sky overhead at aprox 1500-2000 feet AGL.The formation was accompanied at a slightly lower altitude by a triangular object I first thought could possibly be a parachute or ultra-lite.The objects were not birds or seagulls. The formation remained visable for aprox 5 minutes.  Then a group of low level clouds moved through and the objects were hidden by the clouds moving eastward. When I reached my house(within 2 minutes) I ran inside and grabbed a camera and binoculars and went back outside. The clouds had,by now, moved off to the east.I scanned the sky,but nothing but blue sky was visable. Then I observed a single white cross of in the distance (due west).It looked like a large white airliner making a turn. I started to observe the object through the binoculars,when it instananeously shot over head in less than2 seconds.
