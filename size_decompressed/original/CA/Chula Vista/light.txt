Logged in as what though? I don't know! Same as above(q.v.);32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
20 Minutes;2003-01-07 05:00:00;30 minutes;20 Minutes On this date January 7,2003 the winds was blowing hard due to a Santa Ana condition and the palm trees were falling and hitting the house. I want outside at approximayely 4:45 AM and seen this bright light in the sky thinking its a star. But it also appeared it had red lights by it. I picked up the palm leaves and noticed that it moved then stopped again aand thought what is it? So I got a digital camera and started to take a couple of picures as it moved again then stopped again. Upon dowloading the pictures on my computer I noticed that 1 picture didn't show a light on the object and I am trying to figure it out, and a couple of pictures shows a circular blue and white light in the center of the object. Can you please look at the pictures and explain what it is?;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
large bright yellow light  and four smaller red,green and blue flashing lights in the eastern sky ((Venus??));2004-08-18 04:20:00;40 MIN;large bright yellow light  and four smaller red,green and blue flashing lights in the eastern sky Woke up by our dog's bark early am i went and got a glass of water cutting thru our back patio and a light cought my eye and it wasent moving, it was way to early for planes to be flying into San Diego. It was in the Eastern sky and it was bright and large with shoots stemming from it and there were four others (smaller or much further away) with red, green and blue flashing lights.I wanted to explain it off to planes but i woke my wife and she saw thje same thing and asked about the rays shooting out from the large yellow object she got nervous and dident want to watch any longer after a few m,oments loking thru binoculars. They all stayed motonless in the early eastern sky till the clouds blocked my view. I really wanted to right it off to planes or satellites but we never saw them before or since that early morning. large yellowish light in eastern sky On or around 4:15am i was awakened by one of our dogs barking, i went out onto the back patio and dident notice anything to be concerned about. I got a glass of water and headed back thru the back patio to our bed room and a large yellowish light cought my eye i wrote it off to an airplane untill i got to the bed side and it was 4:21am no planes would fly around here at that time. I went back out and looked up at the eastern sky and the light was still there i watched for a few moments and it dident seem to be moving, I woke my wife and asked her whats that? She got up, she dident know we both rubbed our eyes trying to get a  clearer non sleepy view but we both saw this large bright yellowish light with kind of light rays protruding from it and saw four more objects in an apparenet furhter distance they seemed to have a red, green and blue flash to them. We watched for a while thru binoculars they stayed motionless the dawn was starting to break but the fog line moved in about forty mins. after i first saw them. Any explanation to what it was? I wanted to believe they were satellites but we never saw them before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness observed Venus.  PD));32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
A friend and I saw flashing lights in sync. before violently flashing and disappearing.;2006-07-25 21:00:00;5 minutes;A friend and I saw flashing lights in sync before violently flashing and disappearing. I used to work at Knott’s Soak City in Chula Vista and in July of 2006 when a friend of mine and I got off of work we were waiting for a pick up from my friend’s mom because were about 16 years old.  We were waiting in the pick-up zone and it’s about between 8 and 9pm.  We were looking out east towards what was then called Viejas Amphitheater and we saw two (2) blue lights off in the distance.  We can tell they were pretty far away from us and if I had to guess how far apart from each other they were I’d say three (3) miles. At first I thought they might have just been military helicopters because we are a big military city and have military aircraft in the skies all day every day.  But then they started to alternate between one flashing and then the other kind of like two (2) buoys on the water. One is dark while the other is lit.  Then suddenly both flashed rapidly and went dark and all the crickets got quiet.  A few seconds after, the clouds lit up and flashed twice like lightning behind a cloud layer in the same spot. So my buddy and I were amazed but that being said, a little spooked too so we headed down the street a little to get picked up faster but then again we saw the same thing happen this time to the north: two (2) lights far apart alternately flash before going dark then the clouds flash and that was it. We didn’t hear any thunder or sound following the flash. I didn’t know this website existed until recently while listening to AM 600 Kogo and hearing these reports, so I’m making up for lost time now.  Haha;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623

Object Hovering Followed Bicyclist;2011-08-29 12:30:00;1 hour;Object Hovering Followed Bicyclist I was riding my bicycle, as I felt some presence in the sky following me I strolled faster the object what first seemed to look like a Star followed me.  It got as close a 2 light poles high above me. I started to get scared and rode faster and faster to a near Mexican food restaurant that's opened 24hours, Santana's.   I called the could to come outside and he collegue followed as well.  They were shocked to see the light so close and hover over us, now the object was a greater distance above but too close to be a Star.  You close see an oval circular line, which led me to believe only one light was on. we tried to take picture with our phone and even video but due to the poor quality it would not come out.

3 bright lighted aircraft that was a shape of boomerang or somthing (green, white, and red);2011-09-09 22:00:00;8 min;3 bright lighted aircraft that was a shape of boomerang or somthing (green, white, and red) On the evening of 9/9/2011 at 10:00 pm during the Blackout in San Diego County we my family were all sitting in our living room probably like most families with candles all over.  We had no electricity through out the county what so ever.  My wife and kids were on the lap tops. I was just sitting there with them but we had the radio on to see when we can here the electricity would come back on. At 10:00 pm I decided to go outside to see if any of the surrounding housing areas lights had come out. It was very hot as well. I walked in the middle of the culdisak and looked down the street into the valley. As I was looking I glanced up into the sky. I seen an object that was really bright.  I mean real bright! It was green, white, and red bright lights all around it. It's shape was kind of a boomerang or something like that.  The only thing though again it was real bright. As I kept looking at it it was not moving. After about 20 seconds of still looking at it I sai! d to myself that is a UFO. I then seen it move from one area where I will call point A to another point where I will call point B It would go back and forth for around 3 different times to point A and B. It would stop at each location. I say it was around 15,000 ft in the sky. I base that on because an airplane is around 30,000 ft.  The movement to both points were not very fast it seemed like it was cruising. After 3 min or so I was still amazed.  I then ran to my neighbors house accross the street and banged on his door to see if he can comeout and witness what I was looking at. His house was the only one with generator on. But he did not answer.  The object was stil there just going back and forth. I then called a friend named Melinda to run outside of her house so she can see it. I called Melinda because she lived close by. But no Answer. I then called a friend of mine named Jarvis. He lives in South San Diego. He answered and I told him to run outside his house to see if ! he can see the object. He could not see it. I guess he was too! far sou th. After I got off the cell with him I then ran back into my house and yelled to my wife and kids to run outside.They ran outside and I told them to look into the sky. They all looked up and said what is that. I told them this is crazy but this is a UFO an Unidentified flying object! They looked at it and just kept looking at it. I was so excited of seeing it I do not remember how it left. I was tripping out! I will never forget how it looked. Bright green, white, and red lights all over. It was the size of maybe a 727. I also remember it took a dip into the valley and shot back up. Well after my kids and wife looked at it I then went to my front yard and called a few friends to tell them what I saw. They just were listening and asking me questions. After I got off the phone with them I then went back into the house and yelled not to loud but I wish I would have recordeed that. Well little did I know my son recorded it with his I phone and my daughter with her cell phone.! The video you will see on wwww.youtube.com is nothing you have ever saw or witnessed before. The beginning of the video is where I witnessed myself the most. You know looking right at the shape and everythng.  When you go to wwww.youtube.com and put in the search bar (UFO sighting 9/9/2011 during San Diego blackout) you will see my video.

Flying light being chased by a helicopter over Interstate 5 Chula Vista California 30 March 2015 10:20 PM;2015-03-30 22:20:00;10-15 seconds;Flying light being chased by a helicopter over Interstate 5 Chula Vista California 30 March 2015 10:20 PM While driving home from work I was traveling on I-5 in the south bound direction, shortly after passing under the 54 freeway overpass, I noticed to the left of me on the eastern side of I-5 a bright light traveling Northern direction but coming towards me,  I then noticed another light following the first light but not quite as bright, it appeared to me at first that it might be two fighter jets doing maneuvers, the first light then quickly turned West crossing I-5 at a very high rated of speed I'm guessing about 250 to 300 Mph quickly pulling away from the second light.   When the second light passed in front of me I noticed it to be a helicopter, I know this because I work with helicopters and it had the distinctive shape of a helicopter red light on the top of the tail and I could see that the tail rotor was enclosed in the tail pylon. I believed the helicopter was chasing the light because when the light quickly turned south over the bay and disappeared the helicopter turned north and broke off the chase.  I could not make out any shape to the first light it just looked like a very bright light moving at a very high rate of speed and because I'm a military veteran I've seen many types of aircraft at night and I have always been able to make out their shapes, such as a helicopter, passenger air plane or fighter jet. I could not make out any shape at all around this speeding light so I can only believe that I was some special military project or something unknown to me.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
Witnessed a red pulsing light and what we thought was a white star.;2017-06-15 17:15:00;10 minutes;Witnessed a red pulsing light and what we thought was a white star. This incident occurred in Chula Vista, CA, between 5:00pm and 5:36 pm.  My Daughter and I are in town to assist my Mom after a surgery last week.  My Mom’s Neighbor invited my Daughter and me to take advantage of their swimming pool while she and her Family went out of town to go camping.  So we decided to do just that.  In her yard she has a lounge and as my Daughter and Niece were enjoying the pool I decided to lay on the lounge to relax.  As I was laying in the lounge I noticed a plane flying really high in the sky.  My Mom regularly has planes fly fairly low while waiting to land at Lindbergh Field.  This plane was definitely cruising much faster and much higher than other planes. This was when I noticed a faint white star in the North Eastern sky as I was lying facing North. It was clearly above the plane that flew by.  The star was faint enough to lose the image of the star in the ocean of blue sky in So. Cal if I looked away.  I used a palm tree to pinpoint the faint white star and kept staring at the star because it seemed to elongate then turn into a pinpoint, but I figured it was because I was literally staring at this star in the sky and my eyes were playing tricks on me. I decided to open up my star app on my phone, my Daughter and I love to use it up where we live in Auburn, CA.  The star app showed the tail end of ursa major or ursa minor I don’t quite remember which constellation.  In addition I am not sure if the app was calibrated properly.  Another plane flew by, again high in the sky, but not in the path of the star, which I thought was strange because I first saw the star because of the flight path of the first plane.  Then I considered the current plane is probably flying from a different airport to a different location hence the different location of the star in the sky. I continued to stare at this star when all of a sudden a red round light appeared right next to the star. Appeared is not the correct explanation it faded into view.  This red light pulsed and faded into itself.  The size of the round red light was smaller than the size of a round sewing pin when it was wide open and it disappeared when the pulse collapsed in on itself. I sat and stared at this pulsing light that was way above the next plane that flew by.  It circled around the white star all the while pulsing. At that time I thought I was seeing things.  No way could a red pulsing light be so high up in the sky circling around what I thought was a star.  So I called my 11 year old over and asked her to lay with me.  We use specific words to pinpoint stars in the night sky regularly so I directed her to the faint star in the sky.  She said, “Oh my god Mom!  I’ve never seen a star in the daytime before.  Is that a planet?”  Then she said in a concerned tone.  “Mom, what is that?”  I asked her to describe what she saw.  She said, “What is that pulsing light? Mom? What is that light circling the star?”  She had a little fear in her voice.  I said to her I was not sure what we both were seeing and that I’m glad she saw it too.  We both laid there and watched this pulsing light slowly move around the star one last time and then it moved east.  A tiny little pulsing red light expanding and collapsing in upon itself about 12” to 16” in the sky and then poof.  It was gone. I continued to watch that star for an additional couple of minutes and then I realized.  The faint star had moved North East in the sky about 6” toward the palm tree.  After thinking about this incident for the last couple of days I realized that stars move from East to West in the sky and that star moved East so slowly that I didn’t realize it until after I stopped looking at the star and took one last glance up.  What I saw was not natural.  It was not a meteor. It was not a plane. I have no idea what we saw.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
This object had a look of something I've never seen before.  ((anonymous report)) ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch?  PD);2017-09-23 23:00:00;90 seconds;There is much commercial and military air traffic in this area, however this object had a look of something I've never seen before.  It was a point of light traveling from north to south along the coastline.  The object gave off an aura such as you might see when an airliner is moving through low clouds or fog but the conditions were severe clear tonight.   It was about 60 degrees above the horizon and I thought it might be a jet heading to Brown field.  An airliner out of San Diego Lindbergh Field flew across its path, but I couldn't tell if the object was below or above the jet. The object cast a bullet shaped aura.  I thought it might be a meteorite crossing the sky, but this thing moved much slower across the sky than any meteor I've seen before.  As it moved across the sky to my left, the aura ceased and the point of light faded as if it had gone behind a cloud.  There wasn't a cloud in the sky. At this point the light reappeared without the aura and then was gone after about 5 seconds.  I don't know what this could have been.  I watch the airliners fly out bout to the east over my house all the time.  I have a commercial pilot license.  I'm a federal law enforcement agent.  I am in possession of all my faculties.  But ((what)) was this thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623

On Wednesday December 02, 2020 at approximately 1744 hours while working out at Norman Park in Chula Vista, California located at Del M;2020-12-02 17:44:00;1 minute;On Wednesday December 02, 2020 at approximately 1744 hours while working out at Norman Park in Chula Vista, California located at Del Mar Ave and F Street I observed 20 to 30 lights that looked like the size and brightness of satellites you would see in the night sky. The objects were traveling above me in a straight line spaced evenly apart. This was observed for 1 minute flying from southwest to northeast and another male person working out also observed the lights. The park lights were bright which made it hard to record, but when observing the recording you are able to barely see the lights in a single row. The other male witness called his family (3 members) telephonically and they walked to the park a few minutes later but the lights were gone. However we did spot 2 more lights traveling in the same direction and both instances were recorded on an IPhone X.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
