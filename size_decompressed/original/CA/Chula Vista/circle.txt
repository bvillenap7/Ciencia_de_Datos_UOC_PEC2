At first I thought it was man made but it didn't make noise and it had lights going counter clock wise with all sorts of colors...its hard to discribe it the UFOs on TV don't come near it..

Bright object moved slowly across the sky in clear daylight and in formation with at least 10 other objects.;2003-01-04 14:30:00;10 minutes;Bright object moved slowly across the sky in clear daylight and in formation with at least 10 other objects. At approximately 2:30 p.m., on a very clear day, I looked up and noticed a long contrail that had gone across most of the sky Southeast to northwest.  I also noticed a very bright object high in the sky.  It was so bright that it looked like a very large star, except that it also appeared somewhat elongated, and this was in full daylight.  It was moving very slowly high in the sky so I decided to quickly grab my binoculars from my truck.  Using my binoculars I was totally surprised to see that there were actually a total of 10 to 11 circle shaped objects within the background of the brighter and larger object.  These other objects were also moving with the bright object in a formation-like manner (triangular and diamond shaped formation).  I could see these smaller objects only with the binoculars and were not at all visible with the naked eye.  These smaller objects appeared like white faded spots around the bright object and they did not reflect much light.  My fifty-six year old sister also saw the objects with me.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623

I was watering my backyard at around 6:30 PM when I noticed that there were circle of lights sporadically flying or moving fast in different directions in the sky over the clouds.   I quickly stopped watering and grabbed my camera inside my house, then started shooting pictures of the circular objects moving in different directions.   This sighting lasted for approximately 30 minutes.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
