Fiery ball of flames that was no meteor being fallowed by helicopters.;2016-03-17 21:25:00;3 minutes;Firey ball of flames that was no meteor being fallowed by helicopters. My wife, daughter, and I were driving, when I look up in the night sky and I noticed what appeared to be meteor with a firey tail.  What was strange about this sight was that it wasn't falling at a extreme speed.  It seemed to moving west towards the ocean.   At first, i thought it was plane that was on fire because I noticed it had two red blinking lights.  As we stopped at an intersection waiting for the light to turn green, we continued to watch the firey ball.  Then the blinking red lights separated from the firey balls and it came clear that the red lights were from a helicopter following the ball of flames.  The ball of flames then vanished upwards leaving the helicopter.  We arrived home, which was just around the corner from the intersection where we first saw the object.   I Immefiately stepped out of my car and looked up into the sky and noticed that there were many helicopters flyer overhead in what it appeared to looking for the firey ball.  I noticed a neighbor walking and asked if she noticed the object and she replied that she had been watching it since arriving home from work for over an hour.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623

We were at a concert and prior to this UFO, 2 white owls came flying above the crowd.  It was very unusual for these birds to be there.  Shortly after, this UFO is to everybody's left.  Soaring down very slowly and then changing direction very quickly.   Everyone started freaking out but no ones phone would take a clear video.  I took a picture though.  It then disappeared behind a mountain very quickly.;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
