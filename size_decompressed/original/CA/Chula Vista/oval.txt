Slow Moving, Oval shaped, very low in the sky, and a very bright white,and it vanished…  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS?  PD));2008-08-07 21:05:00;1:40;Slow Moving, Oval shaped, very low in the sky, and a very bright white, and it vanished... I saw a slow-moving, oval shaped, bright white  object in the sky.  It moved App. NW to SE and it lasted about 1 minute 40 seconds.  It moved then it made a sharp left turn then a sharp right blinked red once and vanished.   Also I am a student pilot so i know a airplane when I see one and this was not an airplane ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS passed directly above Chula Vista at 20:53 hrs. on the date indicated, traveling from NW to SE.  However, it would not have been low in the sky, except during the early and later part of the event.  PD));32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
One Oval Spining above Chula Vista;2010-01-05 02:11:00;10 seconds;One Oval Spining above Chula Vista On January 5th, 2010 at 2:11 am I thought I saw what looked like a UFO about 60-75 feet above my house (my house is about 18 feet tall at the highest point). It looked like an oval in the sky with a purple and a green light. It looked like it was circling in the sky. I could see the outline of the figure. It wasn’t very big it looked like the size of a Cessna airplane but round. It moved very fast it lasted about 10 seconds  (I was looking thru my 4 by 3 foot window). I knew it wasn’t a reflection from anything. It also was not a light from outside because almost no lights were on, the only lights that were on were from a stop light but those were not the colors of lights I saw. I never saw anything like that before. When I saw it I didn’t think of anything but “UFO”. Thou I don’t have any proof such as pictures or videos I know what I saw and nothing can change that. I do believe what I saw was a UFO thou I only saw one. Thank you;32.6304275409836;-117.02763442623
