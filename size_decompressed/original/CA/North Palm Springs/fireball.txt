Fireball traveling from Palm Springs, Ca. towards Joshua Tree National Monument at 4AM on May 11, 2011.;2011-05-11 04:00:00;3-5 seconds;Fireball traveling from Palm Springs, Ca. towards Joshua Tree National Monument at 4AM on May 11, 2011. While traveling east on Interstate 10, my husband and I observed a fireball cross the freeway from South to North at a high rate of speed.  It looked low in the sky.   From our perspective, it was about the size of a beachball (not tiny like a star).  It disappeared toward Joshua Tree National Monument.  We thought that it could be a meteor. There were other people traveling on the freeway at that time and they would have seen it also.;33.9267;-116.544
