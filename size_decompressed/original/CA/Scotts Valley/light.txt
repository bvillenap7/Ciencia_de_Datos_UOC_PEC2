Helicopter chasing a UFO;2005-07-06 22:00:00;45 seconds;Helicopter chasing a UFO I was checking the mail as I came home from work and I heard a helicopter overhead. I looked in the direction of the sound to the west but couldnt see anthing at first. I then saw a bright white light that I first belived to be the aircraft. But as it got closer I saw that the helicopter had a red flashing light and was FOLLOWING the white light!!  The light had a diamiter of about 1 foot, and was about 100 feet infront of the aircraft. They flew almost right over my head and the light started to fade. They flew for another 100 yards or so and the light dissapeard. At this point the aircraft stoped and hovered for about 30 seconds, before turing to the north and flying off.;37.0604730769231;-122.019296153846
