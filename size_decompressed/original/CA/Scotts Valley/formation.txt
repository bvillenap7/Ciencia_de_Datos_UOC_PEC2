3 Rods in a Unilateral Triangle Formation appeared to follow Hiway 17 Northbound;2000-03-14 16:35:00;2 Minutes;3 Rods in a Unilateral Triangle Formation appeared to follow Hiway 17 Northbound 3 reflective (or light emitting) Rods in a unilateral triangle formation came into my view while walking between buildings where I am employed in Scotts Valley. It was 4:30 PM, early evening with plenty of sunlight, against a clear blue darkening sky. The Moon appeared in the background of the sighting. The object(s) moved slowly (25 MPH?) at a distance of 1500(?) feet from my vantage point. There was no associated sound, although the hiway drone was moderate. The formation stopped momentarily, made 2 full clockwise rotations (parrallel to the ground) and proceeded on its previous northwest heading, apparently following Hiway 17 toward the direction of Los Gatos. The first impression of the light was similar to a highlight following the contour of a chrome bar (of each independent Rod) as they reflected sunlight, while manuvuering the rotations. Then doubt followed, as the yellow and blue light was irratic and became very bright not characteristic of reflective light at all, but perhaps emitted. The object(s) continued in the direction noted, got very dim several times and abruptly dissappeared.;37.0604730769231;-122.019296153846
