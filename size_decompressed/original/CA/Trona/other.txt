I was driving on SR 395 southbound, headed for Rancho Cucamonga, Ca, passing near the Trona turnoff, when I noticed a formation of red lights in a semi-lozenge pattern, with the outer lights flashing in a regular manner resting on the desert floor. What struck me as unusual was that there was no headlights or stoplights that a gravel combination would have had, and the pattern of lights shifted relative to my position. Owing to the fact that I had neither binoculars nor time, I did not stop my combination to more closely observe the phenmenon. On the return trip, the conditions were similar, but there were no lights, so any idea of a mining installation was out of the question.;35.7481;-117.3808
