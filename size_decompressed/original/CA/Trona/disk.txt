It seemed to be very distorted and was wabbling very bad. It seemed to change shapes for a few seconds(10 or 20)untill it turned into a UFO.It was a disk that then started our way. It flew right over us at least 30ft. from us. It was so close that i could have hit it with a rock! Anyway it was going a couple of miles an hour only as it passed! It was close enough to see detail. It had grooves on the bottom 2 closer to eachother twords the out side and the third groove more twords the center. As it was going by the dome on the top of the ufo would open from the center outward! When it would close i couldn't see a seem.But when it was open there was a red light coming from it. This light seemed to be coming from behind a red diamond shape pattern.The dome doors would open periaudicly It seemed that since we could see the red diamond shape pattern that the dome wasn't spinning yet the rest of the disk was.Anyway it wasa great sighting and i've been looking ever since.Till the sighting i submitted today over Ridgecrest Ca.    17 years later!;35.7481;-117.3808
