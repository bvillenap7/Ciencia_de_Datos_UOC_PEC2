7 Orange Flying Orbs Over Chino/Ontario, CA.;2014-05-13 21:30:00;20 minutes;7 Orange Flying Orbs Over Chino/Ontario, CA. I was walking at a park in Chino, CA. (south side of the park) and I saw to the North of me, pretty much over Ontario, CA several extremely bright orange lights moving slowly and low (relatively speaking).  Three of these orange lights were in formation like a triangular formation with at least another two single orange lights near it.  These lights began to ascend upward and toward an eastern direction with their lights becoming dimmer as well. I would then see another orange light also hovering low and from the North direction it too began to ascend.  Finally, the last orange light came slow and low from the north as well. This one hovered for a minute or two and then also began to ascend.  I was able to take some pictures with my LG Android camera (older version) the pictures do not do the object justice compared to what I visually saw.  FYI:  The orange lights were bright and amazing, meaning, nothing I have ever seen before color wise in the sky.  For the record, the park where I was at west of it would be as if though you are headed to L.A.  East of it would be as if though you were headed to San Bernardino.  South of it would be as if though you were headed toward Temecula or San Diego and North would be as if though you were headed to Ontario, CA or Upland, CA or the Mountains such as Mount Baldy.;34.004269047619;-117.681879166667
