Saucer craft remained motionless in the sky. It has been a long time, but it still haunts me, or intrigues me I'm not sure.  I had just picked up my ex-wife from school in Ontario, CA. An hour, or so past dusk. It had been several months since we moved from the Chino farm home we were renting, to live with my parents to save money. Something provoked me to take a detour that night, through the desolate farmroads of where we had begun our marriage.  It was a fairly clear night a couple scattered clouds. Thinking back, the whole thing sounds staged. We saw what we thought was an eclipsed moon, at first. I only caught a glimpse, then made a right turn, but continued looking at it in the rear view mirror.  Although the light surrounding it resembled the moon's corona, it was clearly oval in shape, and some sort of craft.  I looked forward, as I was driving and there was the moon in front of us. I had to stop. I turned around, drove toward it slowly, as we approached a stop sign. Here is the corny part just past the stop sign, there was a mid-80's sedan, stopped in the middle of the road, the interior lights on, the headlight on[I think], all four doors open, and unoccupied, apparantly.  We continued to stare at what we now clearly identified as the typical saucer shaped UFO, somewhat concerned with the empty car in front of us. The craft was extremely still, and although it's appearance was not vivid, it was well defined that is to say, it could have been a hoax, but it was the most elaborate hoax ever.  We looked on uttering silent profanities for roughly 10 minutes, maybe 10 seconds, maybe an hour, who know's.  Then, a streak of light. Suddenly, the patch of light was visible in another location, farther away, but how much farther, I couldn't say.  In fact, I don't know if the craft, while in front of us, was 100 ft., 1000 ft., or higher in the sky.  Hoax? Goverment craft? I will never know.  But I will always know it was not an illusion.

Round UFO with yellow-orange moving lights traveling east to west and disappeared.;2010-09-26 22:12:00;2 minutes;Chino, Ca.  Round UFO with yellow-orange moving lights traveling east to west and disappeared. On Sunday,  September 26 at  10:12 pm, I was sitting on my front porch facing to the south.  I saw a UFO traveling from east to west moving at a slow to medium pace and it was about a quarter mile away from me and about 600 to 700 feet in the air, but could still slightly see that it was round in shape. There were lights that appeared to be yellow-orange in color on the side of the object, rectangle in shape, vertical and solid.  There were about 4-5 single lights separate from one another. The lights moved from left to right in succession and didn't see the lights again for about 2-3 seconds and repeated, as if the object was round, so the lights went out of  view until they came back around in view.  The entire sighting lasted for about 2 minutes traveling to the west, and then completely disappeared. I am a college graduate currently in the health care industry as a medical coder and biller.

UFO over chino California caught on film...;2011-07-04 08:00:00;2-3min;UFO over chino California caught on film... On the Fourth of July of this year 2011 we had a few friends come over.  As night fell we went to the back yard to watch fire works.  As my friend went in side the house I notice a red bright light out side coming toward us flying over head.  I yelled at my friend to hurry bring out the camera there is a freaking UFO fly over us. As he grabbed his camera, he caught the tail end of the UFO on tape.  I turned left witch is north east toward Los Angeles is where the UFO was coming from a second UFO came into view.  He filmed this and got a real good shot of it.  You can really see the shape of the craft saucer shape.  On the video it looks bright orange or red but in person I could see other colors like green radiating from it.  I would like to post it but we don't have the cable to the camera.  On the video the craft looks like the middle is separated as if it had windows where they can look out.  The craft made no noise and it appeared to fly slow and smooth. I called Chino police is where we live in California, to see if anyone else has reported the sighting and they said no.  As soon as I get the cable to the camera, I will download it and post it here and Coast to Coast.  The video is very clear witch I believe to be one of the best UFO videos ever filmed.;34.004269047619;-117.681879166667
