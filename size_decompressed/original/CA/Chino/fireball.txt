I then snapped about 3 pictures, all my neighbors were in shock due to we were just explaning the same situation the night before. the weather was partly cloudy and these objects were below any of the clouds.  Estimated distance 2nd night was 10-50 miles away, 1st night was same weather and about 5-25 miles away.;34.004269047619;-117.681879166667
