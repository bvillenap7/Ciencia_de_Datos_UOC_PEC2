Dancing Lights in the Sky;2007-11-26 04:30:00;15-20 minutes;Dancing Lights in the Sky As I was leaving for work at 4:30am - I noticed 2 - bright circluar lights in the sky above me. It seemed to be above the clouds - and they were chasing each other - at a very high rate of speed. They were going in circles and back & forth - appearing to be playing. I wasnt quite sure what it was....I tried to video tape it with my phone - but it did not come out. I proceeded to leave my house - heading on the freeway and  noticed there were other people slowing down to look at the lights as well. Then all of a sudden - the lights just disappeared. Does anybody know what this was ?? Possibly a UFO ???;34.004269047619;-117.681879166667

5 plus orange lights over the south land of Chino, CA.;2016-06-10 23:30:00;10 minutes;5 plus orange lights over the south land of Chino CA On 6-10-2016 @ approx. 23:30,  5 orange lights swarmed into the sky in front of us to the south of Chino, Calif., and kind of maintained an orbit, almost hovering for several minutes, then a couple of the  orange lights just disappeared as 3 more appeared followed by 2 more.  I  thought at first it looked  like helicopters no noise all of the lights just vanished.  There was  a minimum of air traffic which  is unusual since approach  for LAX is in that path.  Shortly thereafter air traffic seemed to resume and noticed some high flying aircraft criss-crossing in the skies above jet sounding like military.;34.004269047619;-117.681879166667

Orange lights over Pomona and Chino on 1-28-19.;2019-01-28 21:00:00;2 minutes;Orange lights over Pomona and Chino on 1-28-19 I observed 3 orange lights traveling in a southeast direction three at a time.  They traveled over Pomona and over my house in Chino.  Aircraft from ONT were traveling West from ONT airport.  The first 3 orange lights traveled about a half mile apart and disappeared in the low clouds.  The next three traveled in the same path and the last one stopped overhead, hovered for about 10 seconds and disappeared in an upward motion.;34.004269047619;-117.681879166667
Series of lights appear on ridge;2021-01-15 23:20:00;15 minutes;Series of lights appear on ridge Lights on the ridge near KSOX Doppler Radar Tower and Black Star Canyon.  Unusual lights high in the sky that seemed to be a small line of blinking lights.  Viewed through 2nd story apartment window.  Noticed it was not moving closer or further away as I was in the kitchen and where the lights were coming from were high at the very top of the ridge. Often just a single light but sporadic moments of multiple lights, sometimes fading in and out.  One time 3 lights in equal distance from each other were twinkling on.  Then later it was two lights but closer together.  At the brightest intensity, it was quite bright.  Not unlike when you'd see an airliner's lights directly on.  Activity ceased around 11:35pm.  The ridge is dark now.;34.004269047619;-117.681879166667
