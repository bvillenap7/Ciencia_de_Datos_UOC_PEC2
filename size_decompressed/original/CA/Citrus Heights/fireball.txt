Fireball object seen;2012-03-07 20:15:00;2 minutes;Fireball object seen Saw large fireball shaped flying object.  Thought it was a plane on fire at first.  It wasn't just an orange light it was flickering.  It then must have turned because it started getting smaller.  10 minutes later we saw choppers in the area ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Four fireballs move from west to east in the Sacramento sky.;2013-06-12 22:20:00;West to East;Four fireballs move from west to east in the Sacramento sky. I was leaving a friends house in Citrus Heights and driving north, when I looked up to find four fireball like objects that appeared to be burning in the sky.  I thought it was something falling from the sky.  At first glimpse it looked like a plane crash or something. I quickly pulled over to continue watching the action.  When I looked back into the sky, the fireballs were still there.  The scary thing was that they were not falling.  They were flying across the sky from the west to the east and moving the same speed as a commercial airline would, only, the fireballs appeared to be flying at a lower altitude than a commercial airline would (hence the reason why I may have thought they were falling at first glimpse).  They were however flying at a higher altitude than a helicopter might.  The fireball in the leading position was flying about 30-60 ft. ahead of the other three.  The three following all seemed to be mimicking the lead fireballs movements.  The firebal! ls moved from Right to left in an arch formation, stopped, and then shot from that stopping point about the same distance as the arch in a diagonal line from bottom to top.  The other three fireball were about 10-20 ft. apart from each other like they were playing follow the leader.  This all happened in approximately 1-2 minutes and then they continued on east until unseen.  The leader was almost already unseen while the other three were still making the formations. It was a very exciting and interesting experience.  I have never seen anything like it before.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
