Slowly floating object with strange lights, moving across the city.;2012-03-06 21:00:00;2 minutes;Slowly floating object with strange lights, moving across the city. I was standing outside of my work waiting to get picked up, and I see over a building something floating really really slow, not even going 10 miles per hour, with lights I have never seen before.  It looked about a mile away from where I was. I watched as it floated slowly across until I couldn't see it anymore.  I was to shocked to go get someone and my phone wouldn't be able to see it that far away in the dark.  It was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life.  I believe in UFOs a hundred percent and now I know for a fact that they are here on earth.  A plane could not go that slow, and a helicopter doesn't have that shape.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
5 or 6 bright red-orange balls w/white light on bottom slowly following same path in C. H., CA night  sky.;2013-03-07 20:45:00;5 minutes;5 or 6 bright red-orange balls w/white light on bottom slowly following same path in C. H., CA night  sky Around 8:45 on Thursday March 7, 2013, I was walking my dog in Citrus Heights and I noticed a bright  red-orange  ball with a whitish light on the bottom moving slowly in I believe a southwest direction. I didn’t think anything of it-  then I saw another one and another one and another one.  All spontaneously showing up and following the same path, equidistant apart, going the same rather slow speed.  I’m not sure now if I saw 5 or 6 I started fumbling with my phone trying to take pictures. They seemed to be moving in an upward direction and then 1 by 1 they disappeared from view.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
Two lights traveling north in the western sky without sound that stop and fade out.;2014-02-13 23:30:00;1-2 minutes;Two lights traveling north in the western sky without sound that stop and fade out. I was walking my parents out to their car at approximately 2330 on 2/13/14.   As we were standing in front of my house, which faces west, I saw an orange/amber colored light moving north.  It was coming from behind the tree across the street when I first saw it.    At first I thought maybe it was a plane or helicopter, but there was no sound and the light was solid and there were no other lights flashing around it.  It was large and oblong in shape.   It slowed down to less than half the speed it was traveling and then another light, exactly like it followed.   As the second light got closer to the first, they both began moving north at the same speed.  They stopped and hovered in place.  I ran into the house to get my phone so I could record it.  My parents stayed outside and watched the lights.   As I came back outside, I began recording the lights.  The first light faded out, followed by the second light shortly after.  Total recording time was 49 seconds.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
Strange Object Flying over California's northern valley.;2016-09-16 19:50:00;3 seconds;Strange Object Flying over California's northern valley. Over the night sky around 7:59-8:01 pm facing south I was standing in my driveway smoking a cigarette, when in the sky appeared a oval object that was descending rapidly north-west. It lasted in sight for no more then 3 seconds. It had a orange fiery trail behind it,the frontal part of the descending object had a kinda opal glow on the front side as it fell.  The sky was open in front of me no trees blocked my view,also it appeared as if the object had slowed its decent after a second of me noticing it,it had slowed by what I would calculate as 30-40% maybe the strange part was after only seeing it for a few seconds it vanished as if it had flown behind something I couldn't see, the trail of orange followed into the same absence of sight.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
