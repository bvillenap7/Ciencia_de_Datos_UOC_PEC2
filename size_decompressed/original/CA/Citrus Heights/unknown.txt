When they moved they all seemed to kind of float together keeping the same formation. They floated south and them seemed to disappear by fading away. A whole bunch of cars stopped near the intersection of Antelope and Old Auburn Blvd. When we drove a little south and stopped near Woodchuck Way. Some neighbors in that area said one of the objects had come down real close within a few hundred feet above their homes. I don't know exactly what they said they looked like but I thought for sure I would hear something on the news but not one thing.. It is still a puzzlement.

Orange Triangle or Orange flames?;2003-12-26 01:40:00;3 to4 mins;Orange Triangle or Orange flames? At around 1:40am I went to the backyard it was about 36 degrees w/ an exceptionally clear sky. My backyard faces East and there were no surrounding lights so the stars were very bright white and  ltblue, appearing to twinkel.As I was admirring, a different color caught my eye, coming from the East, a very large orange light was flying in the same manner as a plane but only a mass of orange light could be seen, keeping my eye on this orange light I called for my son. When he came out to witness it he thought it looked triagular in shape.Because it was so late and cold it was also very quite, and this thing had no noise before or after it passed over. By then my son(16)had told his cousin(17)to come take a look, at this point I was facing south on my tip toes watching this object still glowing orange as if to be flames, and suddenly a a smaller mass or ball of orange light or flame popped or broke off from the larger one and slowly decinergrated into air as the larger one was desending and very slowly appeared to dim and then it faded out or we lost sight? we were in total awe, waiting to here a sonic boom or see an explosion but nothing. I have seen questionable things in the sky before but this time I had two witnesses. I felt driven to share this after finding this web sight today for the first time.I'm curious if someone in the same area saw what we did.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
I saw a bright light traveling South by Southeast. As it headed south it gradually faded away.;2004-05-29 21:43:00;45sec - 1:30 min;I saw a bright light traveling South by Southeast. As it headed south it gradually faded away.  I didn't think much of it at first but it happened again tonight. The first time was a couple of days ago in the same location.  It also could be a metor.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
Colored lights in the sky over Sacramento;2016-01-04 20:30:00;30 minutes;Colored lights in the sky over Sacramento Stationary object hiding behind the clouds. Pulsating color lights in the sky that repeated the same flashing pattern of red to purple to blue and green.  It was very cloudy that night and I could see the lights illuminating behind the clouds.  I watched it do this for approx. 20mins and then it switched from a flashing light reflecting in the clouds to a straight thin beam of light that flashed the same colors and in the same pattern.  This was especially an amazing sight to see.  It did this for another 10 minutes, or so, before I finally went inside.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
I started investigating on my own starting the end of month July up to present day. Unless objects just disappeared for whatever reason;2016-08-10 01:00:00;5-6 hours;I started investigating on my own starting the end of month July up to present day.  Unless objects just disappeared for whatever reason which is unlikely being that every night I see them generally in the same area but spread out as if strategically positioning themselves from all directions in my particular view (front porch).  Every night after 1200am to 500am they will either hover still in same position for hours or IV seen them move very slowly at random times with no warning and or logical reasoning.  Some are very high but some get very close. close enough to get a real look at its detailes perhaps.  These lights/orbs/star-like pulsating flickering of blue red green yellow and white pulsating lights.  They can look like bright stars or near by planets but I've done alot of reading and investigating to find a close enough report that resembles mine;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
Pulse boosting light;2019-09-21 00:30:00;20 seconds;Pulse boosting light Partner and I having cigarette just after midnight.  Clear sky but a considerable amount of light pollution.  After we sat down I looked south into the night sky and saw what looked like a star at first but upon focusing my eyes better it looked like a dim fireball very far off in the distance at about 30* up from southern horizon.  Looked like tiny fireball boosting leaving a tracer, breaking or slowing for an instant and then boosting again as if some kind of pulse propulsion.  Had a tiny decline between pulses.  It boosted about 6 times.  So distant I had to look away and blink a few times to make sure I wasn't seeing a bug under a lamp etc.  Incident occurred quickly over about 15-20 seconds and was gone.  My partner watched the whole thing too.  We both questioned our vision at first before I actually spoke up.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
