Object of an unknown type cruising at a low rate of speed over the area of Citrus Heights;1997-05-08 05:15:00;2 min (approx);Summary : Object of an unknown type cruising at a low rate of speed over the area of Citrus Heights While on my newspaper delivery route, I observed an object which I initially believed to be an aircraft decending to land. It then occured to me that it was in the wrong area to be either leaving or arriving at the airport. I then noticed that the lights which I had though were the wing tip lights, (which as you know blink red and green) were only white and that they were blinking in a circular pattern. There appeared to be a red light on the underside of the object which did not blink. The white lights were very bright and continued flashing the entire time that the object was visible to me. The object appeared to be cruising very slowly approximately 1 to 2 miles away. I could not hear any sounds coming from the object even though it is very quiet at that time of morning.The object appeared to be circular in shape but overall was similar to the shape of a derby hat with a domed section on top. from my vantage point I would estimate the size to be approximately 25 feet in diameter. As ti travelled I eventually lost sight of it as trees in the area blocked my view. I am a 45 year old male, I wear glasses and the other observer was my son who is a 15 year old male, he does not wear glasses. The entire sighting lasted approximately 2 minutes.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832

In broad daylight in the middle of town, myself, my friend, and strangers watched in amazment and puzzlement.;2004-04-01 14:30:00;30 minutes;In broad daylight in the middle of town, myself, my friend, and strangers watched in amazment and puzzlement. My coworker and I went out in front of our county office for a cigarette and when we were about to go back in something caught my eye.  There was a black object above the residential area across the parking lot and across the street.  It was very large, it seemed as big as a house.  What is that? I said.  ((name deleted)) looked, but couldn't identify it either.  It made no sound, had no lights, and was turning in it's orientation very slowly and changing shape as it hovered about 500 feet above the residential area at a distance of about a half a mile.  It was impossible to make out any features, it just looked like a black lump with a flat underside.  Sacramento is littered with aircraft and I've flown myself.  There were no lift planes, no engines, nothing that could be identified with any type of aircraft, and it was completely silent.  I told ((name deleted)) to go inside and get the sheriff, but he had already left and another coworker came out to see what she was talking about.  Two men who had also been watching the object from our parking lot came drove up to us adsking, what is that thing?  At the same time on of our clients and her children came out and saw us looking up and also saw it.  It seemed to be getting closer, moving silently and slowly.  Everyone else began to leave but ((name deleted)) and I stood and watched as it slowly started to drift hight and higher.  As it did the bottom showed a distinct triangular shape.  ((name deleted)) went back inside but I continued to watch as it just rose ingto the stratosphere and disappeared.  I felt very strange afterward.  Very confused, but very tranquil.  I think it's because it wasn't some flashy sci fi UFO thing.  I had seen it, and others with me.  On my way home I called a local news station on my cell to see if anyone had reported seeing anything at that location.  They said no but wanted to know what I saw.  I told them briefly but neither they or I pursued it further.  The tranquil, huanting feeling followed me for days, despite being teased by our coworkers.  I think it just confirmed what I believed was true, in broad daylight with one of my best friends with me as well as a bunch of strangers. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Sighted several bright green, rectangular lights both descending and ascending sighting lasted about 2 minutes.;2005-10-04 00:50:00;90 seconds;Sighted several bright green, rectangular lights both descending and ascending sighting lasted about 2 minutes. What I saw is as follows:  There were approximately 9-12 bright green rectangular objects (lights).  When forst observed, they were approximately 175-180' away and approximately 75-100' in the air and descending rapidly in what appeared to be an undulating movement.  While most of them appeared to be about 9-12 wide and maybe 14-18 long, there were 3-4 which were larger possibly 14-18 wide and maybe 24-36 in length.  After descending, they appeared to go into/behind a large pine tree.  At that point, we were only able to observe a greenish glow which lasted for approximately 60-70 seconds.   All of a sudden, they began ascending at a high rate of speed (faster than they had descended) and when they reached a height of approximately 200' above the tree (which is about 60-65' high), they suddenly disappeared from view.   While my wife thought she heard a faint whooshing sound, I didn't.   It is also interesting to note that there's a large Doberman who resides at the residence next door to where the pine tree is.  Although we have both heard this animal barking numerous times, on this night, the barking was totally different in its tonal quality.  Rather than the usual barks of a large animal, at the time this was happening, it issued only 3-4 barks and they sounded fearful...almost as if the animal was shocked.  Although we usually go out for air several times/week at around the same time and have done so for almost 10 months, this was the first time we've ever seen anything. The following evening, we looked all around the neighborhood for anyone who might be displaying green garden lights however, there were none observed.  We were unable to locate anyone else who may have witnessed this event.  FYI:  I am a former police officer and have been a professional investigator & trained observer for over 25 years.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
 I though I saw a satellite, I watched it, then saw several more.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-24 05:25:00;5 minutes;I woke up early and took my dog outside, it was still dark and I was looking at the night sky when I though I saw a satellite, I watched it for a few seconds before it disappeared, I then noticed several more following in the same direction, all equal distant apart except for one which was flying to the right of the group, I counted ten in a row that were going North to South. The all looked like satelittes or stars (very high), no flickering from lights and they were moving too fast for an aircraft.   I was an aviator in the US military for 30 years and have never seen anything like this.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
