Stationary sphere-with-a-flat-bottom with white lights turns on edge and zooms away.;2005-11-03 17:21:00;1 minute;Stationary sphere-with-a-flat-bottom with white lights turns on edge and zooms away. We were traveling eastbound on I-80 and exited the Freeway at Elkhorn/Greenback lane in Citrus Hts, California.  The light was red so my mother and I were just waiting on the exit ramp for the light to change.  I noticed an unusual object hanging in the sky above the trees at my 2 o'clock.  I thought it must be attached to the top of a very tall antenna hidden by the trees because it did not move.  Viewed from this angle it had the shape of a pan of Jiffy Pop (halfway popped) without a handle.  The pan was solid with a row of white lights set into the side. The rounded top appeared to be a framework of wire with a hazy, gauzy covering sort of like the angelhair that people put on Christmas trees.  I thought I could see through the framework because the rounded part of the object was the same color as the sky.  I observed the object for about a minute.  It did not move and the lights didn't move in that time.  Suddenly, the lights flashed a couple times and the object turned on its edge showing us the top. Then it looked like a frisbee, on edge, suspended in air for a second or two.  Then it flew away on edge so quickly we were startled.  It was still the same color as the sky giving the illusion that we could see through it.  Traffic had started to move when the lights blinked so I could only follow the object from my 2 o'clock to my 5 o'clock.  My mother turned to follow it but it was gone.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
Heading North on Sunrise Blvd. and saw circular object with lights around it's rim circle 2 and a half times and vanish.;2008-11-20 19:30:00;30 seconds;Heading North on Sunrise Blvd. and saw circular object with lights around it's rim circle 2 and a half times and vanish. I was heading North on Sunrise Blvd. I was in the left hand turn lane at Antelope Rd. and Sunrise Blvd. The object was north of me and about 1200-1600 ft. in the sky. It was circular with bright white lights rounding its rim. It circled 360 degrees two and a half times, at a 45 degree angle and disappeared. If the moon where the size of a silver dollar hanging in the sky, this craft was about the size of a penny in comparison if flying in front of it.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
6 shiny metallic sphears in formation,  that was maintained through turns,crossing the sky fo10 to 15 minutes.;2013-02-02 14:00:00;10 minutes;6 shiney metallic sphears in formation,  that was maintained through turns,crossing the sky fo10 to 15 minutes. Febuary 3, 2012  UFO sighting approximately 2:00pm 2/2/2013. The location was over Citrus Heights, California, and witnessed by neighbors along with us.  What I saw was a formation of round shiney objects,  6 total, that were very high up in the sky.  They were slowly moving from a northeast direction that made a perfect L turn that changed the direction to the north. The front 3 objects made a perfect triangle and the fourth was in the rear.  Two others were following behind and every move that the 6 objects made were in sync with each other.   We watched this for about 10  to 15 minutes until they were out of sight and appearing to go in the direction of Beale Air Force Base. They were not airplanes or hot air balloons or birds or anything that I have ever seen before. I called my son and his family who also saw these.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
Large orange orb hovering above neighbors house. Made no noise at all.;2020-04-15 19:00:00;2 minutes;Large orange orb hovering above neighbors house. Made no noise at all. I was on the phone, I went outside to smoke and this huge bright orange/red orb seemed to be hovering above my neighbors house. It seemed so low, but I thought this can't be, this huge orange blinking orb right here? I was telling my cousin on the phone what I was witnessing. It scared me, so I went back inside. I never even thought about taking a picture.  Here's where it gets really weird. The following day I had zig zag scratches on my back and a mass near my spine. The scratches are gone, the mass is still there. I'm not sure if related, but they weren't there that night and were the next day. Scary.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
