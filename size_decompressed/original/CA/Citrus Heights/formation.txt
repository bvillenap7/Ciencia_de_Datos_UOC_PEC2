Four gold glowing globes of light in formation, then breaking formation.;2008-01-01 01:00:00;10 min.;Four gold glowing globes of light in formation, then breaking formation. Four objects or gold glowing globes of light in formation then separating from each other.Very high altitude. Eventually some began to move vertically some horizontally. One dropped a small object to the ground of the same glowing color. Two of the objects seemed to collide or merge then disappear.Appearance looked like Mars or other bright stars. Was witnessed by a local teenager by himself and he was very uneasy about the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible party lanterns, but that is a guess.  Many other reports.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
3 Translucent gray equidistant circles connected by straight bars;2011-06-24 23:05:00;5-6 seconds;3 Translucent gray equidistant circles connected by straight bars On June 24th @ approx. 11p, my son and I were talking and having a cigarette in the backyard.  I was lying down on my chaise star gazing, as I do every clear night, looking northeast.   Something large and low suddenly caught my eye to the southwest.  As I was turning my head I thought I was going to see a bird, until my eyes locked onto the object. Three gray/translucent perfectly equidistant disks connected by lines/bars flew slowly and silently overhead, then completely disappeared before a tree positioned to my left (northeast).  The size of each disk was apparent 1 degree in diameter.   My mind was quickly running through all of the things it could have been tethered balloons?  No, flying perfectly aligned together, never breaking formation.  Remote-controlled toy?  No, it was translucent with a dull luminescence and the way it was flying was just too odd and absolutely disappeared in flight.  The only way I can explain its appearance and flight path is as if I was looking at the back end of a vehicle in flight, but couldn't see the front body of it.   It only was visible for about 5-6 seconds then completely disappeared BEFORE it would've gone behind a tree.  I'm really not sure of the height, but it looked about 200-500 feet in the air hard to tell because of its translucency.  Unfortunately, by the time my son looked up it was already gone. I've been an avid star watcher for a few years, so I know what is normally in the sky.  I know which are satellites, iridium flares, space station, stars, planets, planes, helicopters, etc.  This really was nothing I've ever seen before. My other grown son and couple of his friends have also seen transparent low flying crafts at the height of 200 ft (explains the craft as cigar shaped, transparent as if looking through a heat wave & having 3 gill shaped lights on the underbelly) late at night at our house 1 last year and 1 about 2 years ago.   Three yrs ago, my grown daughter and her friend were lying on the roof.  They saw an enormous triangular black craft with a white light at each corner (she explains it as about the size of her hand at arm's length) fly directly, silently over them at approx. 600-1000 ft high.  It scared them so much they were crying hysterically and ran inside.   My kids and I are truly objective, grounded people who I believe have just seen very unusual things.  I work as an analyst, so it's my job to be observant, analytical and objective. I would very much like to know if anyone else saw it or have ever seen anything like what I've described.  I've attached a drawing of what I saw at my perspective lying down on my back porch overhang to my right/southwest (where I first spotted it), tree to my left/northeast (where it disappeared PRIOR to the tree).  Hope the visual helps.   Thanks for your time.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
Star formations moving in unison in a straight line for an hour.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 21:00:00;1 hour;Star formations moving in unison in a straight line for an hour. Starting at 9:00PM us 4 saw 3 star looking formations in shape of an acute triangle moving over the sky in unison perfectly spaced from each other. Then following the triangle came about 20 more star formations followed in a straight line perfectly spaced. Then a pattern of straight ufos move along with triangles. It happened for 20 minutes in one direction then they would start in another direction. They kept coming like they were in orbit together lasting an hour. We found out they were not satellites.;38.6971318584071;-121.290543362832
