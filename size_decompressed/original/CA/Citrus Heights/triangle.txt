There were three very distinct bright lights flying in a triangle shape. There formation would change shapes from a triangle to a line and back. They were flying from the southwest to the northeast. It was cloudy but they were flying below the clouds. Finally one by one the lights slowly went out. I couldn't quit tell there speed but it didnt seem to be to fast. It lasted between eight and ten minuts. This was the second time two of my friends had seen these lights. They saw it sometime in early 2000. None of my friends cell phones worked when this happened. They called aand all they could hear was there own voice talking back. About a minute after the lights dissapeared a helicopter headed towards the general area of the crafts, if this is relavent.
