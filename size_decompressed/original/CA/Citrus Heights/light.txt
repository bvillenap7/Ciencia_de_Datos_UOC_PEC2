I was driving down the road when I looked up and saw six lights (two sets of three) in a 'V' formation moving slowly two what was my right.  About a mile up the road I saw a bunch of cars pulled over looking up at the sky.  It was another mile before I reached my apartment I loked out the window and at his point they looked as if they were forming a circle (they were all in a circle except one).  I then went out my front door and was standing on my stairs but I couldn't see the lights do to my building.  Within a minute or two an upside down triangle formation came into my view as startd to pass my building.  They moved fairly slowly and the bottom light slwly dimmed to nothing.  Then the top left light dimmed to nothing then the fourth light came into my viewpassing my building.  That light then dimmed.  Finally the top right light dimmed to nthig.  I couldn't see what happened to the other two lights.  The lights were a yellowish color.  They were steady and slow moving.  I didn't hear any noise when I got out of my car.

It would drop suddenly at a arch and change colors to blue led like light with 1 orange light.  When it didn't move it looked exactly like a star.   We recorded this with our iPhones. Then we got our binoculars and that's when we saw the multiple colored lights. This was no doubt in our minds a UFO.
