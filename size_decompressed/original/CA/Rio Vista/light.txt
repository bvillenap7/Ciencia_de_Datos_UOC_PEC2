Strange objects flying in perfect formation above Rio Vista, Ca  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-14 04:45:00;10;Strange objects flying in perfect formation above Rio Vista Ca This morning on my way to work I stopped at my normal stopping place and gazed up at the stars when I noticed an object/light almost star like flying high as I followed it through the sky about 15 one after another came behind it perfectly distanced apart looking like stars in the sky.  About 7 or so in there was one that flaked another and as they passed it was like a reflection was bright enough to make them shine like a bright spotlight in the distance;38.164;-121.7002
