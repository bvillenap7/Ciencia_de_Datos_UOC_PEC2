Military Cloaks Plane;2009-09-03 04:49:00;8 seconds;Military Cloaks Plane While traveling west on 160 just south of Rio Vista before the draw bridge I noticed a faint glow at around 1500 ft and traveling 400 - 600 mph.  The object if you could call it one had a trail behind it roughly a few hundred feet.  The thing I saw is kind of hard to describe.  The front of the object, (assuming the front was pointing to the direction it was traveling), had a copper like glow emitting from it and the trail behind it had the same glow just less intense.  I tracked the object as it went from east to west until I lost view of it.  I do not believe what I saw is extraterrestial but a military cloaking plane on a test run.  This is the second time I have seen this object.   The first was a few months back but in Stockton, CA.  Same description.;38.164;-121.7002
