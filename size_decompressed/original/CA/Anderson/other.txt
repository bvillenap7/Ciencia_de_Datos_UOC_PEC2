This did light up the sky too, there seemed to be a trail of exaust like sparks emitted from this thing;40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998
Bright floating tinfoil looking object.;2016-08-08 14:30:00;10 minutes;Bright floating tinfoil looking object. I was walking home from the store, and almost home, when I observed in the eastern sky above my neighborhood numerous white and different color objects that looked like floating paper or tinfoil.  They were lit up or reflecting light, and were coming out of nowhere, and never landed (except we saw one headed toward the earth).  The rest of them just disappeared some went across the complete sky.  They were just floating sporadically around with no visible means of propulsion and no particular direction, and then just disappeared.  I ran inside the house to get my camera, and got a little footage of one object.  I have the video in slow motion.  The second object I saw today (8/9/16).  It looked like floating tinfoil high in the eastern sky, and stayed in the same spot for about three minutes or so, and then headed west.  I chased it but lost sight, and I never saw it land.  Keep in mind, the camera was shaking when I recorded.   This sighting was at about 5:30 P.M.  Last year, I did the Robert Bingham UFO summoning technique, and managed to get a couple sightings.  However, this year I have now had four sightings in the space of a month, even though I stopped the summoning technique.  It seems like I opened a portal, and these things are swarming in.;40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998
