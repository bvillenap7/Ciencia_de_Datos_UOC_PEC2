Redding/Anderson  Fireworks July 3rd, 2000;2000-07-03 21:45:00;2:00 min;Redding/Anderson  Fireworks July 3rd, 2000 We were watching fireworks in Anderson, Ca on July 3rd, 2000, from Millville Plains.  A flat plains area 10 miles east of Redding at the start of the foothills towards Mt. Lassen.  Are view was slightly south of west from that vantage point.  Fire works were @ fair grounds in Anderson . Anyway , aprox 9:45 while fireworks were going my girlfriend and I saw what seemed to be a shooting star going east to west.  It burnt out, from our vantage point, right above the fireworks, but up in the sky a bit.  (an open hand's width @ arm's length).  Then right at the spot it burnt out this light started blinking.  (The light was quite a bit brighter than any of the stars and didnt have a steady blink like a aircraft.)  Then the akwardly blinking light moved horizontally toward the north we'd say half the distance between anderson and redding in a couple of seconds.  (5 miles distance i think)  Then it went south back over the fireworks, stopped, blinked a few times  then the blinking stopped and that was it. It def. was not any aircraft i have ever seen, my pops a pilot and i have grown up around avation, and that was no plane!  We could see the commuter flights going out of redding heading south and they were way slower and lower on the horizon than the blinking light.  Neither of us has seen anything like this and it was exciting when we saw it.  We listen to Art bell and just thought we would give you are info of what we saw for the books.   Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar reports for July 4, 2000, from across the U. S..  We presume the correct date for this report is as indicated by the witness, although we are surprised by the fireworks display on July 3rd.  PD));40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998

Moving lights that changed colors and sped away at a high rate of speed.;2011-12-31 23:59:00;5-7 minutes;Moving lights that changed colors and sped away at a high rate of speed. 1-1-12 Report of UFO in Northern California skies, witnessed by 7 people Dec. 31st, 2011 at about midnight. On Dec. 31st 2011 at my residence, at approximately midnight, 7 witnesses, including myself noticed 8 reddish/orange lights in the southern sky that appeared to be large stars that moved slowly in a westerly direction.  The light from them seemed to twinkle and they would sometimes fade in and out. They hovered still for a few minutes, then they started moving west, slowly twinkling/fading in and out, then they disappeared.  All 8 seemed to be at a similar distance from the horizon, but not in a parallel line (approximately where the sun would be at 3-4 p.m. at that time of year, but in the south).  The weather was calm with no clouds visible.  There was no commercial airline traffic visible.  In retrospect, I realized that I live in the flight path for commercial air traffic from the south into the Redding Airport.  It seemed odd that there were no flights that night. After they disappeared from the southern sky, 3 more of them appeared in the North Eastern sky, slowly rising from the horizon.  They behaved the same as the other’s, except that after a few minutes of hovering and flying around in the same area, they started moving south along the horizon, slowly moving higher in the night sky.  When they got about where the sun would be at 11a.m. at that time of year, they changed color to a white/opaque (like a ghost) and shot away in a southerly direction very fast. 2 of them seemed to follow each other in a south westerly direction and 1 went south by itself.;40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998
One orb of light shooting away from the smoke, another orb of light behind smoke, and one beam of light coming from top of the smoke.;2015-02-03 09:30:00;~2 seconds;One orb of light shooting away from the smoke, another orb of light behind smoke, and one beam of light coming from top of the smoke. The 3 of us were at Walmart, and right next to Walmart is some sort of factory that always has white smoke coming from these giant pipes.  I wanted to take a picture of the smoke in the sky, and so I did.   But when I went back to review, in the picture it looked like some sort of orb of light was shooting out and away from the white smoke.  There was another orb of light inside or behind the smoke, it looked as if it was not moving.   There was also a beam of light coming from the top of the smoke. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the stripe of light that appears to be radiating from the top of a column of steam is a lens flare, caused by the camera's being pointed at the Sun, but we cannot be certain.

Blue light with patterns about 4’X8’ on ground at our feet moved about 20’ then gone.;2019-10-27 21:00:00;5 seconds;Blue light with patterns about 4’X8’ on ground at our feet moved about 20’ then gone. Sitting on our front patio we saw a blue light that was about 4’ wide and about 8’ long move at our feet from left to right and moved about 20’ then gone.  In the blue light it had several patterns that I could not detailed on.  We have no traffic in area and we live at the end of a road next to a river area.  No head lights could be seen from where we were.;40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998
