Brilliant white fireball over Redding, CA.;2015-01-12 19:00:00;5 seconds;Brilliant white fireball over Redding, CA I have seen numerous fireballs overhead in the past couple of months, but this one was huge. Two of my neighbors also witnessed this one.   It was a brilliant white ball which appeared abruptly at about 45 degrees above the horizon just north of west from our location and maintained both its size and luminosity as it descended to the horizon (unlike a meteorite).;40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998
