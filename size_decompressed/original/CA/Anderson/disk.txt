We noticed several red pulsing lights to the south above the tree line.  The lights were moving slowly to the right, some were higher from the tree line but both high and low each individual light would become stationary for a moment and then continue.  The lights disappeared from the right as if going behind a curtain. Immediately to the west, over a 20- 30 minute span, lights began rising one, two, or three at a time. Two might start close together but usually separated with one ascending at a faster rate, and drift to the right or left as if following the gravitational pull of the earth, some meandering around on their own accord until the pulsing lights winked out. It wasnâ€™t until the last three that we noticed that once the pulsing lights winked out, nearly transparent discs continued though the night sky, and just like the lights the discs would pause stationary one moment, then continue in a seemingly impossible trajectory.  I focused in bewilderment on one of these discs after ascending as a light continued as a disc traveling from west to south until it too disappeared. I witnessed this along with 6 other people on new years morning just after midnight. None present were under the influence of alcohol or drugs and all agreed that, what was witnessed was beyond any explanations we could think up.;40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998

We could see blue lights, then switched to red lights spinning fast.  It descended down slowly and got brighter then it disappeared.  20 minutes later we saw 3 more high above the sky moving, like satellites, but going all different directions.;40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998
