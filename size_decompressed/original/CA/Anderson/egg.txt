It suddenly stopped and trippled in size and changed colors from white to blue.  Then it changed back to it's original size and took off just as fast as it showed up. First, I live in Redding, California, (northern).  At around 12:00am I was standing in my friend's room and smoking a cigarette.  I was hanging out the window so the smoke wouldn't fill the room.  I looked in the sky (north west) and saw what appeared to be a white colored falling star about 3 times larger than the brightest star but it had no tail.   It was moving very, vary, fast north to south (faster than any man made object i've ever seen)and all of a sudden it appeared to stop.  It changed colors from white to blue and at the same time appeared to tripple in size.  At it's largest size it was aproximatly 1/5 the size of a full moon.  It stayed this size and color for around 2-3 seconds and changed back to it's origenal size and color and continued south, taking no time to accellerate and leave just as fast as it showed up.;40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998
