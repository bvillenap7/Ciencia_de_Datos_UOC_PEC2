I was in the 7th grade at the time. I was out in a large open playing field at my school during lunch time. It was a clear sunny day.  The bell had just rung (ending lunch break) and I noticed that I was the last person out on the playing field, so I started walking back to class.  For some reason I then looked up into the air and saw two round reddish orange metallic disks flying overhead.  At first I thought they were balloons, but I quickly dismissed that idea as balloons do not fly in formation (side by side) and they do not fly into the slight wind that was blowing.  I then thought they were two fighter aircraft, because of the small size, but the objects were round, with no wings, no tails, no projections of any kind and they were completely silent.  I stopped walking and started tracking them with my eyes and turning my head to keep them in view.  They were moving from my left to my right almost directly overhead, ~ 850.  After watching them for about seven seconds or so, t! he disks started to approach the area of the sun in the sky.  I turned away when the glare became too great.  I waited for about three seconds, thinking that I could see the disks again as they came out on the other side of the sun, but I could not find them.  I looked all over the sky for several minutes but they were gone.  I went back to class (no one missed me) and told my teacher I had just seen two UFOs (no reaction).  Back at my desk I wrote out a short description of my experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998

Well this night upon awakening I saw a lot of stars as I was turning away I saw movement. Looking closer I saw movement.  Moving the speed of a plane (being a F-14 mechanic in the Navy), these star shaped objects reached the south side of Mt. Lassen and started doing curly Q's and half moons then disappeared.   I am used to counting geese fly over so pretty sure of the number.  Strange.;40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998
