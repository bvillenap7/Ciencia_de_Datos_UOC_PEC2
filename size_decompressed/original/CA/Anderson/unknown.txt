Strange bright lights in Northern California sky;2004-01-11 19:03:00;varies;Strange bright lights in Northern California sky Shortly before Christmas of 2003 we noticed a very bright light above the hills off our back deck.  At first we thought it may be a star but have never seen it before.  After observing the object for several hours it would suddenly disappear.  This piqued our curiosity.  We have seen it only on very clear nights...it begins to appear around 17:00 and disappears at varying times.  We finally tried to view it through our binoculars and then the telescope...Our best picture, of the one closest to us, was captured on video tape about a week ago....Last night was the first clear night since the video was taken so we took a picture with my camera.  We also saw it land on the hill directly behind the house but it is not close enough to check it out.  We live in the country with a canyon behind our house.  They appear to move and disappear and then reappear later. The video tape show bright flashing lights of many colors and does appear to move just as we witnessed with our telescope.  The camera showed something completely different.  It showed two objects...one that looks like a giant spider but with only 4 legs and the bright light looks like it has a light field in front of it.  Very strange objects...have no idea what it is....Has anyone else reported a sighting such as this? ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been observing a twinkling star, but that is only a guess.  PD));40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998
