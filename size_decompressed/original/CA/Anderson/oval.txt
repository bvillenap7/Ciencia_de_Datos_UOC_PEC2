White orb/oval object high in the sky with no smoke or sound moving from East to West.;2014-10-13 15:30:00;2 minutes;White orb/oval object high in the sky with no smoke or sound moving from East to West. On October 13, 2014, at around 3:30 P.M. I saw what looked like a white orb high in the sky moving slowly from East to West.  There was no sound and no smoke.  It's possible it was a balloon, but I could not tell because it was too high and moving into the Sun light.;40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998

There was one other witness. I summoned them. I had a major UFO sighting today. This afternoon I experimented with Robert Bingham's UFO summoning technique.  I did not get any obvious results. I then walked to the store to get some food and a pair of binoculars. When I was walking home I saw a white orb moving from South to North. I then communicated with it telepathically, and asked it to come closer. Then the one orb divided into a whole fleet of brilliant and spectacular white orbs, forming a whole fleet of about one hundred orbs, and moving from North to South. I could not believe my eyes, and stood there in total shock. This man happened to be walking by me, and I pointed to the orbs. He also saw them. He just happened to have a knife, and cut open the plastic container holding my binoculars. We both looked through the binoculars and saw the UFO fleet. The whole vision lasted about five minutes. And then right before my eyes the orbs vanished. I tried to record on my Flip video recorder, but since i! t has horrible zoom, I could not see anything. I was in such an exuberant state anyway that I don't think I even focused on the right spot. I was too excited. I cannot even describe the shock and emotions I was experiencing.;40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998
Black object with luminescence seen in western sky moving south east.;2017-06-10 10:15:00;~20 minutes;Black object with luminescence seen in western sky moving south east. At about 10:15 A.M., I was talking to my neighbor outside on my porch, when I noticed high in the western sky a black orb looking object with luminescence.  I then ran inside and grabbed my camera.  The object was slowly moving south east, but stopped and changed directions several times, even moving north.  There were times when it was not moving at all.  It also seemed to cloak at times and bi-locate once (jump from one space to another) and there may have been a couple other white orbs in the vicinity.   It's hard to describe the shape of this object, and I will let the video footage speak for itself.  It was not a balloon because it was changing directions, stopping, appeared to cloak a few times, and was even motionless at times.  My neighbor and I witnessed these strange aerial phenomena for about twenty minutes.  They just seemed to vanish into thin air and disappeared out of site.   I was unable to capture on video the other orbs because there were no background clouds for reference, so I couldn't see them in my camera.  I was astonished at what I was seeing.  The object just seemed to vanish in thin air as it was heading north.  I have two video clips.  The one with me talking is at normal speed.  It is quite shaky, because I did not have a tripod.  In the second clip, I slowed the video down two times and added a sound effect for entertainment purposes.  You will see at 53 seconds, in the slow video, that the object appears to materialize out of thin air, or de-cloak.  My neighbor was with me, but could not see the black object, but he claimed to see three others nearby.;40.4538000000013;-122.328199999998
