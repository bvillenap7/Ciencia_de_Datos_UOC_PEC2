Bright light, followed by blue/red lights. I noticed the object to my left, I was driving south on US 101 and the object was on the Eastern horizon, but appeared very close.  It lasted only about 30 seconds.  It was strange because it was flying very low to the horizon, just above the ground fog.  I thought of a missile launch from Vandenberg AFB, but the object was travelling SSE and most launches from VAFB travel WSW toward the Marshall Islands.  I mentioned this when I got to work, but no one else appeared to have seen it until someone spoke up during our staff meeting.  He was traveling East on Hwy 46 and the object appeared toward the south, out his right window, also travelling in a SSE direction.  He checked the time at 06:43.;35.8993;-120.5976
