The red light and the portal.;2013-09-11 21:00:00;2 minutes;The red light and the portal. My wife and I were driving home from San Francisco CA to Los Osos, CA, we were just about to pass by San Miguel when we both saw a light in the sky.  It was a craft that was sort of triangle shaped. First there was two lights one red and one white, then the red light vanished and the white followed.  I suggested that it might have been a plane, although the lights were not flashing.  Then my wife saw a plane about a minute later, she saw something that freaked her out.  What she explained to me was that of a oval shaped light near the area in the sky where the plane was, she said that the light expanded 10 times its original size then disappeared very quickly. I'd like to think that it was a portal that the light/craft went through.  But who knows?;35.8993;-120.5976
