bright light strait up in clear blue sky,did not move or blink,very noticeable.;2007-01-03 16:40:00;3 min;bright light strait up in clear blue sky,did not move or blink,very noticeable. we saw a bright white object twice the size of venus strait up in the sky 20 minutes before the sun set. it did not twinkle, it appeared to be reflecting sunlight.we watched it for about three minutes in which time it did not move or change at all. then it dimmed almost completely,and looked like a wisp of white smoke,reappeared for 15 seconds and dimmed out.during the whole episode it never moved at all,the best we can figure is that it may have been a geo synchronus sattelite,can these be seen in broad daylight?;37.0914;-121.6067
