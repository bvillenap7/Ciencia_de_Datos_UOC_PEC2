I had driven east on Sepulveda Blvd and turned north onto Madrona (Prairie Ave), traveling north. As I was passing Del Amo Fashion Mall, I casually glanced up at the sky and saw what I first thought was the exhaust trail of a jet plane. I was going to dismiss it but it looked kind of odd. It was white and kind of short and stubby looking, like the plane had just turned on the exhaust.  The shape reminded me of the forked tail of a bird.  The thing that was most unusual was that it appeared to be at an angle that looked like the jet was diving.  This was an angle of about 60 degrees or more from the horizion.  It was sighted to my left, northwest of where I was driving. I thought it was somewhere near LAX Airport or over the ocean near the airport. Because of that angle, I began to keep my eye on it because it looked like something that was crash-diving.  I thought that it may be a meteor or space junk re-entering the atmosphere but it did not appear to move.  The trail did not get any longer and it did not dissapate.  It did appear that the two tails were merging into one. At this time I looked at my clock and the time was 7:55 PM PDT.  When I noticed that this exhaust cloud had not moved I paid closer attention because it did not act like a jet or anything leaving an exhaust trail behind.  Then at about 8:00 the exhaust cloud appeared to move!  At first I thought it was an optical illusion since I was still driving so I closed my eyes quickly and then looked back at it and it was moving!  The whole cloud had began to move! What I thought was the leading end (pointing downward) started to arch around, pulling the whole cloud with it into a horizontal line!  As it moved it began to glow and changed colors from white to a  bright orange-white line that then remained stationary in the sky glowing orange-white.  At this point I came to a stop light where there were cars ahead of me that cau! sed the view to be obscured.  When we started to move again, this line  was still horizontal to the ground but it also seemed to be lower in the sky than before.  Unfortunately as I moved toward Hawthorne CA, the houses and trees were more dense so it was more difficult to see this object.  I continued to sight it until I reached the area of Marine Ave and Prairie Ave where it was then obscured by trees and buildings.  I stopped at my home for less than 5 minutes and then tried to spot it again as I drove toward the 105 freeway but I could no longer see the object.  I don't know how it moved away or if it did but it was no longer visible.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594

8 Red-Orange Lights Rising off Redondo Beach, CA, coast.;2014-07-08 21:15:00;10 minutes;8 Red-Orange Lights Rising off Redondo Beach, CA coast Tuesday, July 8, 2014 at about 9:15 pm Pacific Time.  Torrance, CA looking west toward the Redondo Beach coastline.   There was a marine layer several hundred feet high and appeared to be off the coast. I stepped out of my house to make sure the cars were locked and noticed a bright red-orange light rising from the horizon.   Looking in this direction you can often see aircraft departing from Los Angeles International Airport.  I am a pilot so when I saw the odd and very bright light I looked to see if there were any of the flashing position lights normally seen on aircraft.  There were none. As the light rose to what I estimate to be about 1,000 feet I noticed two additional red-orange lights rising from the horizon.  I refer to these as lights 2 and 3. Recognizing this was unusual I called by two adult sons to come witness what I was seeing. Light #1 dimmed to a faint white light and stopped in the sky at about 2,000 feet.  The other two rose together then separated their formation.  Light # 2 appeared to track out to sea in the direction of the northern end of Catalina Island.  Both dimmed like the first one but could still bee seen.  Light 3 continued to rise and stop at roughly the same altitude as Light 1.    This pattern continued with four to six more lights.  Some of the lights moved in a straight path.  Some changed directions and stopped in one place at times before continuing to move. I continued watching Light #1, as it approached us.  As it got closer it appeared translucent and white.  It was wobbling and the closest thing I can describe it resembling is a modern parachute.  However, this was no parachute!  It passed us to the south and we lost it as it went behind some trees. Very bizarre!;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
