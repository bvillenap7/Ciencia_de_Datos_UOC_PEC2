Having seen two very bright flashes in the sky, (similar to lightning without thunder), I was watching for more and listening for sirens thinking that the flashes were caused by a traffic accident nearby.  Looking up into the cloudless sky, I observed four lights, slightly dimmer than stars, moving east to west at a tremendous speed.  It could have been either four objects in formation or one object with four lights in a chevron pattern. This craft was MUCH faster than an airliner and was out of sight in about seven seconds. There was no sound in fact, I had noticed before this that there were no planes (large or small) or helicopters in the sky, which is unusual for this area. Never did find out what caused the flashes.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
