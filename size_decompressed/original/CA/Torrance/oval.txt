An oval-shaped flying object appeared on one of my photographs that i have taken for school's yearbook duty.;2006-09-27 12:46:00;less than 1 minute;An oval-shaped flying object appeared on one of my photographs that i have taken for school's yearbook duty. I was going through old photographs today (1/1/07) and found three weird photographs. In first photograph, the flying object appears to be a dot in left hand side. And on the second photograph, flying object is on upper right hand side. Finally, on the third photograph, oval-shaped flying object is cleary visible on the photograph. The incident happened when i was taking photographs for my school's yearbook photos. The photographs were taken within 1 minute time period. Some of my friends insisted that it is an advertisement baloon, but i do not think there is no advertisement baloon that can travel considerable amound of distance within just a minute. My friends also made a good argument on the photograph. On the third photograph, there are two boys looking up to the sky and posing as if they have thrown something in the air. My friends assumed that flying object is an object that those two have thrown in to the air. However, in previous two photographs I could not find those two people carrying any visible and significant oval-shaped object. I do not recall seeing that object because it happend to quick and it happend three months ago.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
Red balloon-like orb traveling at a high rate of speed.;2014-11-20 23:20:00;30 seconds;Red balloon-like orb traveling at a high rate of speed Saw what appeared to be a red balloon at first, but it was traveling quickly, as if motorized, but was silent.   Watched it cross the sky only a few hundred feet up, heading northeast, with a red glow as it disappeared in the hazy lights of the city.  The sky was mostly clear, except for a few clouds in the distance.  No moon, but the stars seemed brighter than normal.
