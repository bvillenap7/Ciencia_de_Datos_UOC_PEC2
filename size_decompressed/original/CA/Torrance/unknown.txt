space craft fly's like a lightning bolt;1992-06-01 23:30:00;45 minutes;space craft fly's like a lightning bolt I was sitting in my mom's car, looking up at what I thought were stars, when the one I was looking at took off after just sitting there and it made sharp turns left right left and then it went so fast and so far that I'm sure it left Earth's atmosphere.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
aluminum color, real bright, and it moves forward real fast then it just stops, then it comes back to its original spot, then go away..;2000-03-13 13:00:00;8min;aluminum color, real bright, and it moves forward real fast then it just stops, then it comes back to its original spot, then go away.. Well, it was about 10,000 ft up, it was an aluminum color, real bright, and it would move forward real fast then it would just stop, then it would come back to its original spot, it kept doing this for about 8 min then it finally it just zipped off.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594

Flying object with flashing lights , traveling at great speed, observed flying NW and returning to point of origin.;2012-01-02 19:00:00;2 minutes;Flying object with flashing lights , traveling at great speed, observed flying NW and returning to point of origin. One flying object observed 02/01/2012 @ 19:00 PST. Description: Two steady lights, two flashing lights, each at equidistant perpendicular distances from the center of the line connecting the two steady lights. Left thick trail of fumes behind it (possibly a military jet? Not ruling out possibility) Altitude: Seemed substantially higher than jets (two planes flew by a few moments later, at a more normal altitude, which added to the mystery of the observed object) Flight path: Headed NW, then changed direction abruptly to N. At 19:13, we observed it travel back to the direction it came from (SE). Speed: Surprisingly fast for a plane, which is what initially captured our interest. Traveled the entire horizon of our view in under a minute. Travelling back it seemed to be going a bit slower, did not change direction.

A giant bird flying across Torrance.;2012-05-06 14:00:00;5 mins;A giant bird flying across Torrance. We were sitting in the dinning room when all of a sudden a shadow passed from the backyard. I was sure it was something big flying.  There were three of us and we all saw the shadow. it took me a while ( less than a minute) to convince my self to check the sky to see what could have caused it.  There were no clouds in the sky and I was amazed to what I saw. it was about 3 miles away from where I was standing but I could still see the size of it like it was just a small bird flying across the street.  I was sure it was not a plane because I could still notice the wings flapping and the way it turned around.  I tried to call the other two friends but they couldn't hear me. so I went to the door to call them but as soon as they got out, we could not see it anymore because of the house blocking the view.

Large Bright object over the sea CA.;2013-08-29 19:16:00;13 minutes;Large Bright object over the sea CA ball of light over the ocean. should be too bright at 7:16pm to see any stars. light was several hundred feet in the air at a distance of about 20-30 miles (difficult to judge distance accurately over water) extremely bright flickering object hovering. within 10 min 2 small jets (what a assume where jets) approached the object from the north. both pilots made two passes in a oval pattern around the object before returning north, the entire time maintain a reasonable rate of acceleration.  At 7:29pm the Bright object lowered in altitude by a few hundred feet at a very slow pace, stopped and made a 90 degree turn at impossible speed traveling north.  The object crossed the span of my visible horizon within 1sec.  The rate of speed and distance traveled was not at all congruent with current aerodynamic understanding.  no noise of any kind was hear. no sonic boom.   Few days later No radio (scanner,SW,IPC,Am/fm)/tv(domestic/international)/media communication of any kind seen in the following days.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
