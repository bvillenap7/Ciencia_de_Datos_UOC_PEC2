silver bright flashy hovering object over southern california beach cities;2018-05-31 15:45:00;>1 minute;silver bright flashy hovering object over southern california beach cities Date of report:  June 1st 2018  Date of sightting:  May 31st 2018  Time  2:45pm PST  Approxiamately UFO Description:  Silvery reflective object  Description of UFO object actions:  Remained stationary well over, one minute and then flew away in a westernly direction. location of the witness UFO sighting:  Torrance Memorial Medical Center, in the middle of and northern section of the medical facility on the 5th floor.  Visiting family member there!. Estimated location of UFO:  Mahattan beach and Redondo Beach in the state of California! Estimated altitude of ufo over hover location 500 or more feet AGL. My statement regarding the UFO:  I saw the silvery reflecting object hovering and motionless,  I looked at it and carefully did some motions  I moved left and right looking for any anomilies reflection off of other objects no result determined maybe UFO.  The view i had I can see LAX traffic departures and determined object was too far south of LAX traffic departures and to low as well.  I determined a UFO at this point, attempted to picture of UFO with cell phone object was unable to be seen in screen and no picture was attempted, at this point attempted a 2nd time object was losing brightness and moved away reflection brightness gone. My statement of my background: I have general aviation flying experience though no longer active, I have flown in high wing Cessna mostly 152 and 172 models and low wing Piper PA-25's mainly. I have worked at LAX as a ramp service agent and refueler.  I attend airshows and I am avid aviation afficienado.  I fly drones general hobby consumer products and R/C Model aircraft.  I'll state this “if it's got wings I am pretty much familiar with it.”   Final statement:  Airplanes require forward movement to maintain flight or go higher in height this did not happen and ruled out helicopter because of windy conditions, and reflections not consistent with rotor blades spinning i.e. rapidly continuing pulsating flashes of light and police helicopters would be only authorized to fly low over a city and still have a forward motion for hindering ground gun fire common practice!.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
Bright red and green flashing lights with no flight path and rapid acceleration below horizon.;2018-10-18 17:00:00;4-5 minutes;Bright red and green flashing lights with no flight path and rapid acceleration below horizon. Sitting and watching for satellites after sunset. saw several and turned toward vega and cygnus. immediately saw a tiny flashing light and thru 10x binos were clearly seen to be a bright red and green flashing light.  no other part of a craft was seen. estimated to be aircraft in size. a tiny white light accompanied each flashing light.  difficult to tell, but seemed to be on no course and made a lazy circle with no darting. ran to get camera and it had moved toward polaris.   after fumbling with camera,  looked up and item dropped like a rock out of the sky, straight to horizon.  could have accelerated, but no way of knowing.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
