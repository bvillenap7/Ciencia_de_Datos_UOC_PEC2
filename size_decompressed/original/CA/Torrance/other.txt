square shaped object over Southern California;2006-01-19 19:00:00;2-3 minutes;square shaped object over Southern California Driving home from work, from the corner of my eye, I noticed a grid of lights to my upper left. It was already dark, a clear night. I was driving alongside the Harbor Freeway (110) and this structure, fairly reminiscent of stadium lights, sat above it. I pulled into the large Alpine Village parking lot to observe. It was square and thin, and I always thought it matched a CD jewel case in dimension ratio-wise. It appeared black in the night sky, with circular white lights that ran in rows throughout the bottom, with one pulsing red light in the center. It was low, about 250-300 feet above the freeway, and would probably be covered by 3/4 of my hand extended as I watched from about 150 yards away. It was about 25 feet on each side. I could hear no sound. And traffic flew by on the freeway below, as this thing didn't really appear all that unusual. But I wondered what purpose a light grid served that high over the freeway. It was completely still, no wobble or sway, as if it were attached to a pole. After a minute of suspension, it cruised south in a straight line over the freeway , about 30 mph and stopped.  A moment later it traveled north again about 1/3 of the way back. Stopped briefly again, then headed east towards the city of Carson, slowly, and dipped it's left side and straightened out again. I decided to give chase, but my car was in poor condition and soon lost it.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
Cloaked UFO shadow seen on low cloud layer;2006-05-20 15:00:00;30 seconds;Cloaked UFO shadow seen on low cloud layer In mid May of 2006 while watching light aircraft on low final approach to Torrance airport from my location about 2 miles East of the airport, I suddenly noticed a blimp sized shadow on a low layer of clouds a few miles to the West moving slowly. Since the Goodyear blimp operates in the South Bay area of Southern California I started looking for it between the sparse cloud layer and the sun that was visible above and to the left of the clouds from my position. To my surprise, nothing was there.  Since the sun was fully visible and the clouds were thin I couldn't understand how the blimp was casting a shadow if it itself wasn't visible where it should be located.   As I watched the shadow, it headed slowly to the North changing shape as it moved over the edges of the scattered clouds as one would expect to see from a large moving object above them creating the shadow. The cloud layer wasn't too large so the shadow finally disappeared as it left the layer on the right after about 30 seconds.  I continued to watch for anything that could have created the shadow thinking it would appear out of the sun maybe or was obscured by the clouds.  Nothing was ever seen in the sky for the 15 or so minutes I continued to watch and no other clouds were in the sky that afternoon at any level that could have caused the shadow. No sound was ever heard and considering the size of the shadow and the estimated four to five thousand foot cloud layer, from past experiences if it had been the blimp I'm sure I would have heard it as it would have been upwind of my location and not all that far away. This sighting has haunted me for months now without an explanation and I am submitting it in the hopes that someone else around this time period may have witnessed it as well. I consider myself to be a credible witness being a private pilot with a passion towards anything that flies.  I've seen lots of strange things in the sky but can usually figure out what they are with some time and logic.  This one has me totally baffled however. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
August 10th, 2012 at 12: 20 AM. I was driving north along the El Camino College campus road when I stopped at a stop sign.;2012-08-10 00:15:00;5 Min;August 10th, 2012 at 12: 20 AM. I was driving north along the El Camino College campus road when I stopped at a stop sign.  I was staring up at the sky in the west when I saw what looked like a star but was moving at the speed of a commercial airliner. It’s flight pattern was at an angle and was heading from south to north.  When it reached a certain height it’s white light went out but seemed to flicker like a dying bulb before doing so. It then changed direction. From south to north to east. This time flying at a level plane.  I saw that it was headed in my direction so I waited till it was above me. When it was overhead of me it was far away but I was able to see that it looked like a grey bubble or blob that was spinning like a saucer.  All this time Ive been stopped at the stop sign though no signs of any auto failure. The nearest cross street was Marine Ave and I facing North on Crenshaw Blvd. It was also a very clear night sky. The moon was also very visible in the east side of the sky. I believe it was a Third Quarter moon. I didn’t see any one else around who might have been staring at this also.  It continued to fly East. I would have stayed out longer than I did to watch it but I was in a hurry. Definitely one of those moments where a good camera and some photography skills would have been great to have.  Thanks, hope this helps.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
Football Shape 10 minutes:  Football like shape lights white translucent than red.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD));2015-11-24 05:35:00;10 minutes;11/24/15 05:35 Torrance, CA  Football Shape 10 minutes: Football like shape lights white translucent than red. UFO Sighting Report:  Nov. 25, 2015 (0535-0540) Torrance CA Shape: Football like shape (bright half halo above the object).  My daughters and I watched it move across the Eastern Hemisphere for about 10 minutes.  I first noticed the object lights, were white almost clear or translucent.  As it moved across the eastern sky the lights changed red and remain a duration of 8 minutes and changed back to white as it move back northeastern and disappear into the clouds.  We realized that it was not commercial plane, jet nor helicopter… however, it was “UFO” appearing during the dawn of Tuesday morning.  Note: from the car it appeared to be ‘triangle’ from the car.  I managed to take photos with my cell phone.  Note: saw same image in Santa Monica, California, around 1710...the moon set in the southern hemisphere - same object hoover and shot immediately from where I was walking behind the moon.

Fake plane, or we have hologram and/or cloaking capability.;2016-05-09 18:49:00;seconds;Fake plane, or we have hologram and/or cloaking capability. Last year I observed a plane with a contrail from a distance of a few miles.  I kept my eye on it intermittently and upon returning my gaze upon it it had vanished. It was clear in the sky, there were not clouds or anything else obstructing my sight of it.  Trail and all, gone instantly.   Today, while arriving home, I spotted a similar plane and contrail, arising from the West as well.  I thought it would make a good reference photo so that in telling the story, people could see what I'm describing rather than have to use their imagination.  Grabbed my camera a Canon SX120 PowerShot and aimed at the plane from my backyard.  The first photo I zoomed in.  Took a second without zoom, for a realistic perspective.   It was now at about 80 degrees angled from me, heading east, and nearly directly above me.  Took aim for a third shot.  Couldn't locate it.  I quickly checked my camera, everything was fine.  Lowered the camera to relocate the plane in the sky and it is now go! ne.  As before, the sky was cloudless.  It was in plain sight, not fading out and getting lost in atmospheric perspective.  At the rate it was traveling, it should have remained in sight for a few minutes more.  I didn't see it blink out.  It was visible and then I suddenly couldn't find it in my camera.  There one second.  Gone the next.   It happened again.  I grabbed someone from the house immediately to corroborate the fact that there was nothing in the sky, that I wasn't missing anything.  I knew I wasn't but this was the best I could do next to having a real-time witness.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
