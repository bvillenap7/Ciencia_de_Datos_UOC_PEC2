Silent Black Silvery Triangular Object with red light visible undernearth to 1 of 3 witnesses vanishes 12/1/2009;2009-12-02 00:00:00;5 minutes;Silent Black Silvery Triangular Object with red light visible undernearth to 1 of 3 witnesses vanishes 12/1/2009 On December 1, 2009, two friends and I were leaving a restaurant at Del Amo Mall in Torrance, California.  We were the last patrons to leave and the well-lit parking lot was pretty deserted.   As we were walking east, I an astronomy buff at heart decided to show my friends the constellation Orion, whose belt was directly overhead.  I was standing in the center with witness two to my left and witness three to my right.   As I pointed to back Orionâ€™s left foot (from my viewpoint), out of my left peripheral (north) I could see a triangular shaped object with a massive tailwind.  The tailwind was more than 10x the size of the object it caught all of our attention.   I began to dialogue with my friends asking if they could see the object and they both agreed that could. We all conferred that it was approaching.  On the northeast side of the mall complex there is a parking structure.   The object approached rapidly and silently over the structure.  While standing there, I asked if they seen a large black silvery (similar to Hematite) triangular object with slightly rounded corners.  They again answered yes.   The object silently flew over our heads covering Orion, the size of the object, the distances away above us, or how much time passed is hard to describe.  It felt close but seemed far above, I tried to size it as it was approaching with my arm extended upwards, and it was the size of my hand making the letter C.   Again, I began to describe the object to my friends as it headed south towards the mountainside of Palos Verdes, CA (not sure actual name of the mountain range) and I asked did they see a red illuminated circle underneath the bottom closer to one of the points of the triangle.   They did not see the red light the red light was very visible to me.  As it neared the mountainside we watched it for a while longer (not sure how long) and it disappeared before getting to the mountainside.  It felt as though this was possibly t! hree minutes longs.   A few minutes later two helicopters appea! red clos e to where the object disappeared, they were substantially smaller than the object and we could hear them faintly.   There is an airport east of the mall but this object vanished with us all facing south.  We talked about it for a while in the parking lot.  Jumped in our cars and went home. Witness 1: A 31-year-old woman from Los Angeles, CA.  She holds a degree in International Business and a Certified Paralegal.  She studies astronomy (seven years), and is an avid sky watcher.   She has an eleven-year-old daughter. Witness 2: 31 year old male from Los Angeles, CA. He holds a degree in Public Administration and a MBA concentration Finance.

Black, silent, triangular, opaque object moving slow over los angeles;2012-05-05 21:00:00;5 minutes;Black, silent, triangular, opaque object moving slow over los angeles Hi! I live about 7 miles southwest of LAX.  Usually planes do not fly over me.  They usually fly around south of me around Palos Verdes because of noise ordinances.  Normally, we have, in the Southbay a heavy marine layer from the ocean, so seeing stars is a real treat when can. Last night I was cleaning my house. It was about 9pm at night.  I wasn't tired.  But, I went out on the balcony to shake out some rugs in my house. I stopped to notice the marine layer gone and how beautiful the stars were that evening. I look up towards Venus,the largest star.  There was about 4 stars around Venus.  I had my direction directly above and low and behold there was something moving. It had no lights that were very bright.  And it appeared totally black.  Against the black sky, one would have missed it if they were not looking directly at it.  It moved at a normal airplane pace but there was no noise. My line of site followed it.  If I looked away, I probably might have lost it. It! was heading northwest towards LAX. As I tried to make out this opaque plane, I could tell there were 6 dim lights on the bottom of it.  These lights followed a triangular pattern.  My gaze followed it until I could not see it anymore.  My first thought was that it was heading towards Vandenburg air force base.   We frequently get a lot of rockets and entrails around that direction.  My second thought was that it was some kind of military drone.  But, why the triangular shape? And it was silent, totally silent. Or, maybe the stealth bomber? not sure.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
Triangle with three lights flew over, very low and completely silently.;2014-06-22 21:00:00;15 seconds;Triangle with three lights flew over, very low and completely silently. Family was outside after my cousin's graduation party. It was dark but we hadn't turned any lights on to avoid the June-bugs.  We were looking up because my uncle had an application on his phone that showed the various constellations.  Then, from one side of the sky I thought I saw movement, but it was hard to focus on what was going on (whatever it was blended perfectly with the light-polluted sky).  I pointed at it and told everyone to look. It flew directly over us.  No sound.  I wouldn't have been able to see it had it not been for the lights that appeared on the corners.  What was strange is that the lights appeared to be facing inward towards the center of the aircraft itself.  As it flew over I was become annoyed by the fact that nobody was saying anything, so I asked, Is anybody seeing this!?  Two of my cousins replied exuberantly, with a hint of horror (which I understand completely, because this was really a strangely terrifying experience).  It disappeared a few seconds later into the light pollution coming up off the horizon. The people who saw it were myself (a 16 year old high school student), my cousin (an 18 year old who just graduated), my second-cousin (also a high school student), and another second-cousin (also a high school student).  Also present were our parents, and two other cousins, all of which did not see it themselves. P.S. I am not including my name or number in this form, simply because I don't know anything about this website (no offense). If you contact me via email I will give my name and number because I will GLADLY discuss further details.  ALSO, if necessary, I might be able to get the other witnesses to talk to you guys. Honestly, if they hadn't been there and seen it themselves, I definitely would have thought I was hallucinating. It was so low and clearly visible.
