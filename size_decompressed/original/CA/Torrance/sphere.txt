White/silver  round balloon like object that behaved uncharacteristically of a balloon over SW Los Angeles by moving up and down.;2000-08-11 10:30:00;2-3 minutes;White/silver  round balloon like object that behaved uncharacteristically of a balloon over SW Los Angeles by moving up and down. I saw  only one object that was silver in color and round or spherical in shape.  It appeared to be a baloon at times but did not  behave like one at other times. It  stayed in one spot for awhile then moved East slowly. Then appeared to change altitude and hover before moving more East.  Then it moved faster and stayed at the same elevation until it was several miles to the East of me. At this time it moved faster and higher and a little South. It went out of sight to the East of me and I was never sure that it really was a balloon. This report is to see if any one else saw it better than me  and reported it. Thank you, 9(name deleted));33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
Gray/Green UFO sighting withe multiple lights around it, in Torrance, CA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet, we suspect.  PD));2009-02-20 20:30:00;1 hour;Gray/Green UFO sighting withe multiple lights around it, in Torrance, California It was 8:30pm on Friday night, 2/20/09. My brother saw the craft up close and ran back home to get his camera. We took pictures on our rooftop. The object was diming its light very low, then very bright about every couple minutes. From what my brother said it was just as big as a comericial airplane or even bigger. It also traveled very fast from east to west. The pictures reveal it to be green and purple, but my brother said it was grey up close. There are other unknown crafts in the picture that we did not see that night. These ones were in triangle formation, and when zoomed in it revealed a saucer with red lights around it. Almost all of the pictures also have little blue dots in them. It then traveled too far for us to take pictures, so we went back inside. When we went back outside 30 minutes later it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet, we suspect.

Reddish orange orb over Torrance, CA;2012-07-22 20:40:00;5 minutes;Reddish orange orb over Torrance, CA On July 22, 2012, at roughly 8:40 pm, in Torrance, CA, 90505, I had just arrived home after a walk and looked up at the eastern sky and immediately noticed a reddish orange spherical light.  It approached me at an altitude approximately the same as that of small aircraft, which were flying at the same time.  Its size was about twice that of a small airplane’s red light.  The Torrance airport is 2 miles north, (plus LAX is 15 miles north) and there are frequent landings/takeoffs, so I thought that it might just be another airplane.  Airplanes usually have white lights in addition to red ones, so I remarked that this object only had a red light.  I did not hear any unusual noises. This object was too bright to be a star or Mars.  It was dusk and there were no stars in the sky yet.  The light did not flash off and on.  It oscillated slightly in brightness in a pulsating fashion.  It did not twinkle like a star.  The light glowed and had a very faint circular haze around it.  It approached my position and flew roughly from east to west slowly, at about the same speed as small aircraft.  This object’s trajectory indicates that it was not a flare.  I saw it fly for about 3-4 minutes and then it stopped.  It remained stationary for about 30 seconds then the light slowly faded out and disappeared.  I did not see a structure in addition to the light. The most unusual part of my observation was the sudden fading out of the light.  If the light did not fade out I would have dismissed the light as an airplane.   I did not see any other observers near me.  This was the second UFO I have witnessed, both in the Los Angeles area.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594

I noticed up ahead a bright two spheres flying, at first I thought airplanes but they were tiny comparing to a plane size.  Looking directly at them I saw the bright light spheres to be what seemed to be shiny silver spheres.  It wasn't real large [huge] but wasn't tiny either.   I grabbed my cell phone and turn the camera on when I looked again they disappeared.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594

Object slowly moved west off the coastline.   At times, the object would go into rapidly changing light sequences.  It almost seemed like a pattern.  Like it was trying to communicate. I watched the object through binoculars for 15 -20 minutes.  It flashed very brightly a few times and then would display color light patterns.;33.8266129659643;-118.320688249594
