Single bright light blinked out and back to different positions Emitted powerful triangular search beam to ground.;1976-05-29 23:00:00;6 minutes;Single bright light blinked out and back to different positions Emitted powerful triangular search beam to ground. On May 29, 1976, three (3) adult witnesses, ages 21-23, observed an extremely bright white light just Southeast of Fallen Leaf Lake at about a 50 degree angle above the Southern horizon while camping in Desolation Wilderness. It did not move across the sky, rather it disappered and reappeared in a different part of the sky instantaneously. It disappeared/reappeared twice. There was no sound, no wind,a new Moon, no other lights were seen that night. This event occurred at approx. 23:00 hours PDT. The white light in the sky (UFO) emitted a triangular beam of light down to the ground like an extremely bright searchlight beam which lit up the entire mountainside like daytime.  When we tried to to &quothide&quot from the view of the object, it would move to realign itself with our line-of-sight. I used a flashlight to send a Morse Code message to the object, but there was no response.  When last viewed, the object appeared to be descending from an altitude of 4000-500 ft. to an altitude of 1000-2000 ft. about 1 mile away when it disappeared behing the tree line.

It was in the winter of 1980 in a place name Lake Tahoe, California, I was living with my parents in a 4 bedroom town house, I was watching TV in the living room with my younger brother, my mom was in the kitchen and my sister was upstairs in her bedroom, it was a normal evening ,  all of the sudden the light in the TV and the light in the house all around got dimmed next thing you know from the top of the house from and back there was a light (orange) light not yellow or any other color it was  pure orange,   even though I was close to the window I froze I couldn’t move and I could feel some kind of vibration or energy around me  I look at my mom and she was stunned also we both couln’t move the light was there I am not sure how long could be about 5 minutes then that light went off and a search light came on it was pure white  And it was searching for something in the back , oh  in the back there was a meadow in between our house and a elementary school .  so the white light look around for few seconds probably 40 seconds or so.  And it finally went off. My sister came downstairs and started to talk about what she sow from her bedroom she sow the yellow light but she couldn’t sow the white light. My cousin and his wife lived in another building in the same community at that time she was pregnant she said that she sow the white light only but none of us were  brave enough   to look at the window  The next morning we notice from my cousin’s place we look up and there were in the sky it was like hiding in the clouds we could see a ring at the end of the cloud that cloud was there for a long time 2 or 3 days,  I just hope to find out some day what really happen that day and if you guys could ask more about it I am sure there should be more people with more information on this case I hope this letter Makes it to your heads;38.9199521172641;-119.98509169381
Bright light over South Lake Tahoe, CA ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus.  PD));2004-04-11 21:50:00;1 hour;Bright light over South Lake Tahoe, CA I went out onto an upstairs balcony for some air and noticed a very bright light, low in the Western sky, over Echo Summit in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. It was too large and much too bright and in the wrong place to be a star or planet and it was relatively stationary. As I watched it began to move slightly down and to the right and then it remained stationary once again. It was not blinking or 'twinkling', though the light appeared to shine much like a diamond. There was no sound. I called to everyone else who was home at the time to come and look at it. They saw it move as well. When videotaped, the object appeared to grow larger and smaller, though we think it was just becoming brighter/dimmer and it was difficult to see what it was since the night was very dark and there was no other stationary frame of reference for the camera. When viewed through binoculars the shape was spherical, rather violet in color with rotating green rings about it with a slight red/orange trail. We called some friends, who lived in other areas nearby, but a few miles away to ask if they could see it as well - which they could. We sat watching it for some time, while it continued to 'hover' and move slightly up, down, left and right. It (very) slowly began moving West and then disappeared at around 10:30pm.

Saw 3 lights zig zagging across the sky over lake tahoe. caught on tape.;2006-06-14 03:30:00;30 minutes;Saw 3 lights zig zagging across the sky over lake tahoe. caught on tape. light(s) zig-zagging across the sky, also smooth rotations back and forth.  Sometimes saw 1 light- then 2 more appeared, then disappeared.  The 1st one has remained steady.  The light intensity changes frequently. I have at least 10 minutes of activity caught on my video camera (including some using the night vision feature on my camera).  I am colorblind so I don't know what color the lights were.;38.9199521172641;-119.98509169381

Bright pulsating light that was met up or buzzed by secondary craft.;2016-12-12 18:30:00;10 minutes;Bright pulsating light that was met up or buzzed by secondary craft. I was driving down the street I live on heading north, I noticed a abnormally bright light that was pulsating straight ahead.  I pulled over to get a better look.  While watching some kind of object that had a flashing light came from above at a very high rate of speed and either buzzed past at very close range or met up with the bright object because I could not see where it went because of the large bright object.   After approx ten minutes, the large bright object began moving south at a high rate of speed until I could not see it any longer.;38.9199521172641;-119.98509169381
