Too round & bright to be a plane it was quiet moved slightly erractically disappeared in a flash;2021-04-04 20:20:00;4 minutes;Too round & bright to be a plane it was quiet moved slightly erractically disappeared in a flash I was just finishing picking-up yard debris in my backyard when my husband came outside.  I mentioned how beautiful the stars were looking tonight.  As I was looking up I saw what I thought was a plane but it seemed a little too bright and round to be a plane and it didn’t have the red and green blinking position lights.  It was round but not perfectly round.  The edges were slightly jagged.  I followed it and it wasn’t moving in a straight line.  It was wiggly, moving suddenly slightly to the left and then to the right.  I asked my husband if I was imagining, thinking something was wrong with my eyes.  He said he sees it too and mentioned that the craft wasn’t making any noise so it couldn’t be a helicopter.  He exclaimed I think it’s a UFO!  We continued watching it and as it moved further away. The brightly lit craft started to flicker then it dimmed and “poof!”  In a flash, the light of the craft went-out and disappeared!;38.9199521172641;-119.98509169381
