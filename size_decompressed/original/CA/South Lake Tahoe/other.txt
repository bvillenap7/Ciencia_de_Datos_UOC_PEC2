UFO captured in hiker's photo in South Lake Tahoe;2016-06-08 13:35:00;<1 minute;UFO captured in hiker's photo in South Lake Tahoe As I was looking over the photos I had taken while hiking in Van Sickle Bi-State Park, I noticed a UFO in the sky in one of my photos.  I did not see the object live, I only noticed it after the fact.  I also took a 2nd photo that was identical in composition to the UFO-bearing photo just a few seconds later.  There was no UFO in the 2nd photo. Both photos bear the time stamp of 1:35PM.  It was a bright and sunny afternoon.  There were a few other hikers in the area, but the park was largely empty while I was hiking. The UFO in my photo is somewhat rectangular, with a black bottom, silver sides, and an antenna coming out of the top.  There is also a bright circle of light on the underside of the UFO.;38.9199521172641;-119.98509169381
