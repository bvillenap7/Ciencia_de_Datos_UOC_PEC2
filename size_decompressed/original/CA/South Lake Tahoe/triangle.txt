Strange Formation in clouds.;2006-07-04 18:15:00;.5 hour;Strange Formation in clouds. We back packed into Desolation Wilderness 07-03-2006.  On 07-04-2006 we hiked to the top of Mount Tallac 9735 feet.  After setting up camp, I started taking pictures of the surrounding area.  My wife noticed a stranged formation in the clouds across from us.  A brown triangle shape formation.  We shot several still photos of the object within a ten minuted window.  Then shot an after object photo.  The object seemed to not move as the clouds passed over it.  I have sent the photo to a editor for magnification.;38.9199521172641;-119.98509169381
