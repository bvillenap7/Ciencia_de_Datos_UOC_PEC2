Spherical metallic UFO spotted in Lake Tahoe Ca;2008-04-30 15:30:00;1 minute;Spherical metallic UFO spotted in Lake Tahoe Ca I was down by Lake Tahoe on the southern side taking pictures of the sunset.  This is something I do quite often since I moved to Lake Tahoe.  As I was standing there on the beach I noticed a small very spherical object moving awkwardly around the clouds.  It looked metallic which is why I believe it was so shinny because the sunset was reflecting off the metallic surface.  Initially the brightness of the object caught my attention but then I realized that this object was moving much faster than a plane and in any direction without losing speed.  I watched this object for about a minute while I was trying to zoom my camera in close enough to get a good photo of it.  I managed to get one clear picture of the object.  I didn't see it leave the area.  I looked up from the LCD screen of my digital camera after I tried to take a picture of it and it was just gone.;38.9199521172641;-119.98509169381
