Mothers Day 2012 Fireball sighting over Lake Tahoe.;2012-05-26 22:00:00;1 minute;Mothers Day 2012 Fireball sighting over Lake Tahoe Mother’s Day weekend 2012:  We were visiting South Lake Tahoe CA.  We stayed at a hotel right on the lake.  We checked into the hotel around 10:00pm.  The first thing we did when we got into the room is check out the view from the balcony.  My boyfriend saw it first, and pointed at this orange ball in the sky over the lake.  It was moving towards the other side of the lake.  I was freaking out and desperately trying to figure out how to take a video or picture on my phone, but couldn’t figure it out.  Then it just got smaller and disappeared into the distance.  This all happened in less than a minute.  A weird coincidence is that we went to dinner earlier and there was broken glass all over my seat and I cut my figure.  Now my left index figure has a triangle shaped scar right below my figure nail. It always reminds me of what we saw.;38.9199521172641;-119.98509169381
