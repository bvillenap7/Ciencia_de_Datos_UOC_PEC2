White stationary dot in the sky;2021-06-11 16:00:00;About 1 hour;White stationary dot in the sky On Friday June 11, 2021 around 16:00 my wife brought to my attention an object in the North Eastern sky over Sonoma County, California. It was white. It was very tiny. It was way to small to describe any details. It did not appear to be moving. The sky was very clear and there were no clouds, at least in the direction we were looking. By around 16:45 the sky slowly began to cloud up and we could no longer see the object. There is not a lot to tell except it was very small, white in color, appeared stationary, appeared approximately 45 degrees relative to North. Trying to report this object was extremely difficult as the UFO center is the only place that responded and that was 3 to 4 hours after we called them.;38.3226;-122.7
