It traveled west to east and disapeared out of my view over the town of Cotati. This object first appeared to be a shooting star but normally when I those they appear high in the sky.  This object appeared to be much closer to the surface of the earth. By this I mean possibly at the same height of a low flying plane.  I did not at first think to do or say anything about it until I saw a news blurb on NBC for a later broadcast that people in the north bay had seen a green comet like object in the sky.  This was at 8:00 PM only 30 minutes from the time of the sighting.  I was eextremely tired from my day and missed the late night news.  No reports in the paper this morning.;38.3226;-122.7
