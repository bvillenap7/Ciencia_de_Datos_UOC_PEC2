climbing light observed;2004-05-01 22:45:00;30 sec;climbing light observed For cross data verification. Observed a light climbing at a steep angle until it faded probably due to height in the vicinity of 80 degrees high south aspect. We regularly watch from hot tub and are quite familiar with airliners, satellites, iridium flashes, rockets and unknowns. We first thought this was a Vandenburg rocket but none appear to have been launched that night per web search.;38.3226;-122.7
Green ball of light sending down green light to the ground.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;10 minutes;Green ball of light sending down green light to the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD)) Was outside feeding my horses at dusk when i saw this green ball of light sending down this green light to the ground, which i thought at first was a helicopter with a search light. The ball of light went higher and higher into the sky until it disappeared, and no helicopter noises either.  The green light stayed even though the ball of light disappeared and it turned into what looked like a neon green smoke or mist, it expanded like one of those into the sky and i sat and watched it for about 10 minutes with confusion. It then got dark so i couldn't see it anymore ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.3226;-122.7
Strange light with green streak.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:55:00;8 minutes;strange light with green sreak ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD)) A very bright light in the sky shining down like a spotlight.  A green trail ( smokelike or like a jet stream) was attached to the light and not the object... The light was shining for about 3 minutes. It was so bright that I felt that if it shined on me, it would be too bright to handle. It never shined down on me. I saw that the light was moving in my direction and this black blanket covered it completely. The green streak stayed there as this ufo floated slowly way up and out in the distance. After it was no longer visible there was white smoke in its place where the black blanket had covered the ufo and light completely.;38.3226;-122.7
Strange light streak over Cotati, CA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Smokey trail appears to be from a missile launch.  PD));2018-12-19 17:41:00;10 minutes;Strange light streak over Cotati, CA At 5:41pm my mom called me and told me to look out my back window, which faces West. She was at the Costco in Rohnert Park and said there was a strange jet-stream in the sky that was glowing brightly.  The sun had already set and when I looked out the window, I was shocked by how bright this was.  It looked like a lasso in the sky.  The oval was on the top right and it trailed down to the left. It slowly faded over 5-10 minutes. After looking online I found this was identical to the lights seen over Reno, NV, at the same time.  However, I am in Cotati (very close to the coast - maybe 30 minutes) and I was also looking West towards the coastline. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.3226;-122.7
