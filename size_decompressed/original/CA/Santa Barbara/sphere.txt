Large yellow-tinged spheroid in predawn sky over Santa Barbara at 30,000 and 300mph;2001-05-14 04:30:00;2 minutes;Large yellow-tinged spheroid in predawn sky over Santa Barbara at 30,000 and 300mph At 4:30am I got up before dawn to go out to my car parked on a Alta Vista Rd not far from the center of Santa Barbara. It was perfectly quiet and still outside and I scanned the sky as I always do for UFOs and I have done so the past nine years with no results until today. I was facing northeast, then looked up and just overhead and to my right I saw a lumious spheroid shape, moderately bright, white and yellowish-tinged, passing in a straight line from the Santa Barbara Channel in the southeast, to the northeast towards Bakersfield. It travelled in what seemed to be a course crossing directly over the southern end of town. At first I had to eliminate other possibilities: airplane, satellite, meteorite, space station, etc. I felt that it was too low to be in space and it was silent, so it couldn't be a plane of any kind. Also the light itself was too round and uniform in shape, and too yellowish in luminescence, from the point when it was over my right shoulder to the time I watched it disappear over the horizon of the mountains. A conventional space vehicle or satellite would show bright white and gradually either brighten or dim out as it crossed the terminator. This did neither. This thing was just too big and yellow anyway and did not change much in luminosity. It was just too big to be either a marker light or a landing light of any kind and it was not on any established airways. I estimate that it was at somewhere around 30,000 feet give or take a few thousand and the light was easily the size of an airliner. I also rule out any natural phenomena such as meteors. There was no flaming tail and no streaking. It was just not that fast either. It cruised along at a fairly brisk pace which I would estimate at a up to 300 hundred miles per hour. But it was high enough for me to watch it for at least two minutes. I noticed no fluctuations in its course, but it did seem to fluctuate in speed and altitude slightly. I am extremely careful about such things and this is my first report in nine years of sky-w! atching. I feel I have a good sense of such objects from being a private pilot and having spent four years in the Air Force. I have never seen anything like it in my life. I am about 90% sure it was not of this world, but am open to other explanations.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Bright green sphere over Santa Barbara;2007-12-14 19:30:00;5 minutes;Bright green sphere over Santa Barbara I was out on my patio with a friend and looking up at the stars, saw a shooting star cross over the Orion constellation. Seconds later a plane passed. Then after the plane noise died away, I could hear a strange noise that sounded like something being dragged on the ground, but it was loud and coming from above. Immediately after that, a bright green light appeared in the sky, out to the West. It hovered in the sky for a moment, then disappeared as it fell below the roof level of the house in front of mine. The only reason it didn't seem like a flare was that it was much larger, and didn't leave a trail as it moved. My husband, who was in the house, also witnessed the  sphere through a window.  The reason I mentioned the shooting star is because a previous poster mentioned seeing shooting stars in conjunction with his UFO sighting in Lompoc, 60 miles away, about a month ago. Anyone else see it tonight?;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Orange orbs over Santa Barbara;2009-04-21 20:15:00;5 minutes;Orange orbs over Santa Barbara Biking along the beach on the bike path, my girlfriend and I came upon a very bright orange colored orb, that appeared to come out the water or beach area.  There was no indication of a trail of smoke, or any noise.  Then another appeared right next to it.  They hovered in the same spot for several minutes before drifting off at what appeared to be a high rate of speed.  We were not the only people who saw them. A woman walking pass us as we were staring up at the sky, said out loud oh my god what is that?   We said that we weren't sure.  As we continued down the path an additional 100 feet or so, there were a group of people who were commenting on the strange and very bright orange orbs.  It was pretty amazing, because   I have not seen anything like it in my 45 years.  They were not of this world.

White orbs with wings.  ((anonymous report));2019-05-04 13:00:00;15 minutes;White orbs with wings. Weather was partly cloudy (thin marine layer over sea, clear over land), wind nw 10kt.  I and a few passersby noticed 4 white dots in the sky.  They had no discernible trajectory but appeared to be moving in a brownian motion (random path) while remaining more or less stationary on a measurable scale.  One was seen through binoculars and the object(s) appeared as a white ball with wings of an indescribable shape.  After some minutes three of the objects disappeared leaving one, which subsequently faded to nothing.  These orbs appeared similar to ones commonly seen launching from offshore (Pacific Ocean) off Pt. Mugu naval sta. seemingly into space at least 5 times faster than rockets launching from Vandenberg, also visible from SB.
