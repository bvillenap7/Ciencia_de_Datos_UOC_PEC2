Black triangle;1994-10-01 20:00:00;3 seconds;Black triangle My dad and I were sitting up on our roof, when all of the sudden, a black triangular shaped object flew right over the tree in our backyard. It was transparent against the black sky, but we could still see it. It had red rights on each end of the triangle. It made no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1994 is approximate.

My wife and I were walking towards our car through the back parking lot of Andreas Restaurant after dinner. I was looking towards the d;1996-08-16 20:15:00;3 seconds;My wife and I were walking towards our car through the back parking lot of Andreas Restaurant after dinner. I was looking towards the direction of where the car was parked when I noticed with my right field of view, a very large  dark object that was moving from East to West just above tree top. The event happened so fast that I could barely point fast enough with my hand (while yelling Look..Look!) towards the object, hoping to get my wife's attention. Even though black in color, it had dimly glowing light along all the bottom edges and the sihlouette of the object was easily distinguished as a large silent triangle. The scene was fairly quiet and I was able to clearly hear in the background the motor noise of a small plane, during and well after the event took place. I was so shook up with my heart pounding that I could hardly breathe. After the event took place I noticed that to attract my wife's attention to the black triangle I used my index finger with my arm fully extended.  This would later provide me with a scale of the relative size of the object.  The speed of movement across my field of view (in this case approximately 70° to 80°) took ~2 seconds. The altitude I estimated had to be less than some visible background mountain peaks that are ~3000ft about ~5 to 6 miles from wher I was viewing. It travelled right over the city and made no sound whatsoever!.  If I had not been gazing at exactly in the direction of the mountains behind the city, I would have missed the event.  It was that quick and that lucky.  After gaining my composure my wife and I exchanged information, but it was clearly evident that she had missed all the initial trajectory as i was trying to get her to follow the object by my pointing towards it.  The next morning I went back to the exact place I was standing the night before and took a picture.  From the picture I was able to determine the relative speed at >800 mph!...and an object size (when compared to some features of the background) observed the day I took the picture. I estimated the object to be some  60 to 80 meters? in some size (It's hard to extract all this from such a short mental picture). It also looked blunt at the back, not aerodynamic per se.  I noted that fromthe perspective that I saw it dissapear behing the trees, it looked more like a wide arrow head but was flat across the back. I purchased newspapers and asked around if any reports were submitted, but was not able to confirm any other observers which would have seen this craft.  I decided to document all my findings before submitting the information back in 1996, but regrettably I lost my report on a disk crash and later was not able to recover the file.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Black triangle about the size of a mid-size commercial jet liner.;2000-03-11 21:00:00;2 min.;Black triangle about the size of a mid-size commercial jet liner. Object approached us from the south at about 400-500 ft. elevation. Object was traveling smoothly and and slowly like a Piper Cub coming in for a landing. Object never changed altitude or speed and made no sound that we could distinguish. Object had a white flashing light at rear end of left wing/tail. We could not make out the rear edge of the object clearly so we could not tell if it had cut-outs like a B2 bomber. We observed this object from the grandstands of a foolball stadeum where Westmont College was having their Spring Sing. There were about 1500 people there but I could not tell if anyone else noticed...A lot of people had video cameras.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
I observed three pale white lights spaced equalaterally rapidly moving in the the sky from east to west above Santa Barbara California;2002-10-30 18:20:00;4 seconds;I observed three pale white lights spaced equalaterally rapidly moving in the the sky from east to west above Santa Barbara California In Santa Barbara, California at 6:20pm on Wednesday, October 30th, 2002 I observed three white lights, spaced equilaterally to each other, traveling at what seemed to be high speed, passing from east to west over the city across about 70 degrees of arc for about three to four seconds until they faded from view into the darkness. There was no sound. I was standing outside my apartment looking up at the night sky while the nearby football field lights illuminated and suffused the sky making it difficult to make out if there were a dense body between the lights. At first I assumed it was a single triangular craft, but upon reflection, I realize it  could have been three separate objects flying in formation. However the lights appeared to be disc-shaped and flat with a pale white glow to them more consistent with lights that might be built into the underside of a single craft. There were no usual red or green navigational lights or strobes at all. This group of three white lights would just fit behind my thumbnail held at arm's length or slightly larger. They seemed to slip through the air silently without reguard to their relative positioning along their lateral axis and were far off the normal flight paths of either high altitude passenger jets or of local air traffic. The spacing of the lights remained consistent throughout the viewing. I do not know if anyone else in Santa Barbara saw this. I have been watching for UFOs for over ten years and this is only the second one I have seen that qualifies as unexplained. Its only speculation, but I would say it could be very similar to the many sightings of triangular craft (minus the central red light) that have been witnessed increasingly since the Belgian triangle flap several years ago.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615

Large dark triangle with very unusual orange lights flying low, slow, and was completely silent.;2005-11-24 20:00:00;15 seconds;I witnessed a large dark triangle with very unusual orange lights flying low, slow, and was completely silent.  Years have past and I have only now decided to report what I saw so the date and time maybe not accurate, but have recently decided to see if anyone else had reported on your web site what I had seen and to my surprise other people have reported the same thing around the same time and place.  This is what happened.  I left a friends house in the down town part of Santa Barbara , I think sometime between 9pm and 11pm on Thanksgiving to drive back to my house in Ventura.  The parking lot directly behind his house was surrounded by trees, 2 and 1 story houses.  I walked to my car and just gave a glance up to look at the stars as I normally do on a beautiful Santa Barbara,CA nights when I noticed that there were no stars, but just a very odd light that was dull orange in color, it was bright, but gave off no hue as bright lights do.   I then took in a wider perspective and noticed that there was not 1, but 3 of these strange orange lights.  They were aprox. a 100 yards between each light forming a perfect or near perfect triangle.  One single light at the front and  the other 2 light were at the back.  On the outside of the triangle lights I could see the stars, house and street lights, etc., but between the orange lights it was black, therefore the triangle was solid.  The triangle UFO moved south to north aprox. 20 to 30mph and was aprox. 100-150 ft. above me.   What really struck me was that a moving flying craft that large and that low with orange lights that I still have not seen since, made no noise as it went overhead, It was completely silent.  As soon I lost sight of it, I got in my car and tried to find it again, but could not.  I have been around airports and military compounds all my life (39 yrs) and have never seen a flying vehicle that had the shape, lights, and audio characteristics of this UFO.

Silent Soaring Triangle with greyish tips heading West very Ominous.;2009-04-17 00:47:00;5 seconds;Silent Soaring Triangle with greyish tips heading West very Ominous. April 17th 2009.  Around 12:47 and 12:48am, I was outside paroling an area in Santa Barbara just South of Highway 101 facing West.   I flinched, thinking that I caught a glimpse of an owl soaring silently through the night.  My eyes caught a visual of a dark triangular object its' three corners were a grayish white, there was no flashing and no other signs of markings, no sounds, no exhaust.  The triangle was acute, I would say it had a 90 degree angle in it.  The unidentified object was at a low altitude, I would estimate 600' - 1200'.  Holding my pointer finger out the object measured 2.   The object appeared to be soaring at a steady speed compared to an owl.  The object was visible for 5 seconds, heading westward. 20 minutes later I got a hold of a police officer who directed me here. I called the National UFO reporting center in Washington state at about 1:15am on the 17th of April 2009.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Triangle shaped craft with lights;2009-05-14 21:00:00;5 minutes;Triangle shaped craft with lights Saw a small triangle craft with lights on all of the points appear in the sky along the beach bike path in Santa Barbara, CA. The same craft or perhaps another one identical to the first appeared again, and then met up with another triangle craft and they seemed to attach to one another. There was no sound, and my girlfriend and I both saw them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Large triangular craft with yellow/orange bright lights flying very slowly heading due east, no sound.;2013-09-01 20:40:00;8 minutes;Large triangular craft with yellow/orange bright lights flying very slowly heading due east, no sound UFO Report Sighting date: 9/01/13 Time of Sighting: approximately 20:40 P.M. P.D.T. Location of Sighting: 15 miles north of Santa Barbara, Ca. LATITUDE: 34.46226N  LONGITUDE: 120.02726W El Capitan State Beach Tonight at approximately 20:40, I witnessed a large triangular shaped vehicle with approximately 7 bright but muted or blurred lights* traveling at a slow speed headed due East towards Santa Barbara California. Craft made no sounds. The vehicle caught my eye initially because of the color of the lights.* The vehicles altitude is hard to judge because it was dark but if I had to guess I would say approximately 1500 to 2000 feet. If, that guess is correct that would make the size of the craft maybe three times the size of a Boeing 747. The craft was witnessed by myself and I was accompanied by wife and there were approximately 15 guest of the park who witnessed the craft at the same time. I brought the vehicle to the attention of the group and asked if they were in fact seeing what I was witnessing?  All answered in the affirmative. The vehicle was moving so slowly we all got a good look at its speed, then it appeared to come to a complete stop, but only momentarily.  Then the vehicle began to move in a forward direction but also appeared to be headed in a vertical direction.  We continued to monitor the vehicle its movement was vertical and slowly east. It then began to appear to gain momentum but suddenly it disappeared. Initially, I thought it may have been an aircraft of some sort because we are on the approach to the Santa Barbara Airport. I also thought that it may have been an aircraft from Vandenburg Air Force Base, which is just to the north of the park approximately 30 miles.  Although it is my understanding that no flight wing exists at VFB, I have witnessed missile launches from that base, both daytime and night launches, none of those launches were anything even remotely like the vehicle we witnessed tonight.  No craft I have ever seen have the ability to accelerate so quickly that they disappear. Having witnessed hundreds of commercial as well as private and military aircraft I knew this was not any of those aircraft at least of the type I had ever witnessed. I must mention that during my career I spent 6 years working in the Mojave, California area, where my office was on the perimeter of the Mojave Air and Space Port as well as our neighbors to the southeast Edwards Air Force Base. I have witnessed thousands of aircraft flying in and out of both of these facilities as well as China Lake Naval Weapons Station which aircraft are in the air almost constantly. The vehicle that was flying over the Park this evening was like nothing I or any of the other witnessed that I discussed the sighting with tonight had ever seen. I then traveled to the other side of the park and spoke to another guest who was a retired firefighter and his wife, they too saw the vehicle and were unable to explain the vehicle in any other terms than, We saw a UFO this evening. The behavior of this vehicle is like nothing commercial, private or military I have ever witnessed. *Nor was the lighting, the color of the lights were something between yellow and orange and very bright.  Those are not colors normally associated with any aircraft I have ever witnessed.  The vehicle had no strobe or marker lights whatsoever.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Triangular, red and green lights, hovering and moving, varying from 300-1000+ feet in Santa Barbara, CA, 2 witnesses.;2013-09-12 23:30:00;~10 minutes;Triangular, red and green lights, hovering and moving, varying from 300-1000+ feet in Santa Barbara, CA, 2 witnesses. Two of us just saw something hovering and flying over Santa Barbara, CA, starting at about 11:30pm, near Hollister and Modoc Rd., when we went outside to get in the car. It seemed to come from the foothills north of Rte 54 and head toward the ocean, eventually hovering very low, maybe 200-500 ft over the ground near us. Then slowly, stopping to hover and slightly alter direction several times and going much higher, over a period of maybe 10 minutes from our vantage point, it disappeared over the foothills on the other side of Rte 101 and north of Rte 54. It was triangular or a thick wing shape, with red and green lights, I think more green than red, possibly 4 green and 2 red.  When directly overhead, we heard a sort of buzzing/whirring sound.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
V-shaped formation of steady, bright, white lights moving close to ground, slowly, silently across night sky.;2015-06-06 22:00:00;10 seconds;V-shaped formation of steady, bright, white lights moving close to ground, slowly, silently across night sky. I was looking up at the stars in sky when I saw steady,bright, white lights in a huge, narrow, V-formation, like an isosceles triangle, moving slowly, silently across sky and close to the ground, in a North to South position.   The point had one light with equal number of lights along sides which I didn't count but guessing at least 10 lights on each side. The body of object blended in with dark sky and could not be seen. Googling images resulted in one UFO seen in Europe.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
