I saw a bright emerald green gigantic object hovering over the Pacific Ocean for two to three minutes.;2007-07-01 21:30:00;two to three minutes;I saw a bright emerald green gigantic object hovering over the Pacific Ocean for two to three minutes. About one year ago, July 1, 2007, I was walking home from a friend's condo to mine in same complex about 9:30 in evening.  At the top of a gentle hill I looked straight down the road running through the condo complex to the Pacific Ocean.  At the foot of the hill there are tall Norfolk pine trees on both sides framing the Pacific Ocean beyond.  Between these trees, over the ocean (cannot judge how far out) in the dark starless sky I saw a gigantic bright emerald green object that looked like a beach ball crushed from top and bottom into a shape like an oval with very narrow sides.  It was deeper green around the edges of the object.  It seemed to be floating over the ocean but I could see no reflection on the water.  I was quite fascinated by the vibrancy of the green color one the outer edges of the object.  I stood there watching it possibly two and a half to three minutes and then it shot off straight out to sea, not up, as best I could tell and disappeared immediately.  No afterglow as it disappeared.  It was just gone!  I rushed inside and called the Santa Barbara Sheriff's office and asked if they had any reports on green foreign objects in the sky.  Non emergency calls were being picked up in the Santa Maria Sheriff's department for some reason and I was told I could not get a contact for a non-emergency here in Santa Barbara.  The woman who answered informed me, Whatever you think you saw it's three days before Fourth of July.  If you really did see something it was early fireworks.  I am 79 years old and I've seen fireworks all my life from Los Angeles to Washington DC to France to China.  I know fireworks when I see them.  This had nothing to do with fireworks!  I then called a friend who is into astronomy seriously and he contacted people he knows involved in it but none of them saw anything.  I didn't know where else to turn so dropped it, other than for conversation starter at boring dinner parties.  Seeing you on Larry King tonight I decided I would file a report.  I was not drinking, I am a very successful published author and lecturer. still working at 79, who is totally balanced mentally and I have good eyesight.  I know what I saw and it was unlike anything I have ever seen before, outside of science fiction movies and my granddaughter's cartoon shows on TV. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Silent craft observed extinguishing white lights, the dark oval shape continued across the early morning sky;2018-01-24 04:10:00;6 seconds;Silent craft observed extinguishing white lights, the dark oval shape continued across the early morning sky On January 24, 2018, at 4:10 AM, in the backyard of my home, I observed a bright white light that I first thought to be an approaching aircraft.  However, I immediately noticed the movement of the object was different from that of an aircraft it moved like an object seen in low Earth orbit (as one might observe the international space station traversing the sky). The movement was smooth and consistent very similar to the way the space station or a satellite would move across the sky but this object was much lower.  I estimate the altitude was between 3000 and 5000 feet. I observed the white light for approximately 2 seconds when suddenly the light completely extinguished. The object went completely dark however I could see the dark shape of the craft continuing across the sky.  The night sky was sufficiently illuminated by the stars and I could clearly see the dark object continuing across the sky from the north to the south (right to left from my position) with absolutely no lights. The lights of the craft blinked out instantly.  This was not a conventional aircraft, there were no red or green directional lights on the craft, nor were there any strobe lights. There was no sound admitted from the craft.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 6 seconds before I lost sight of the object behind the house. Just after the sighting I became rather nervous that I had possibly seen something I shouldnâ€™t have seen.  I was actually thinking that I might come in contact with an alien being.  This thought terrified me and I immediately went inside the house.  There were no additional occurrences after this. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere, and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very reliable witness.
