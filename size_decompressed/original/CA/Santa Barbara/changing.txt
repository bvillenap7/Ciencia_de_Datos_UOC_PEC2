Reflective metal craft seen high over mountains;2003-01-08 15:30:00;30 seconds;Reflective metal craft seen high over mountains As my friend and I were leaving Evergreen Park in Goleta, just north of Santa Barbara, I looked up as we were in the car, through the sunroof, and saw a silver oval or cylinder very high in the air over the mountains.  My friend was driving and I told him to pull over quick so I could watch what I believed was a UFO.  At a stop sign he looked at it and thought it could be a handglider.  I don't think so though because it didn't seem to move and I could clearly see just a metal cylinder or flattened oval-shape.  My friend kept driving and seemed uninterested, which upset me a little because this is the first ufo I've seen during the day that seemed unexplainable.  As we continued to drive I watched it more and it appeared to bank a little without changing position in the sky.  I looked a little more ovalish or disc-like at this point.  A few seconds later, the car went downhill on the highway into a valley and I lost sight of the ufo.  As we came out of the valley I continued to look for it but I couldn't see it anymore.  The whole sighting lasted a little over half a minute.  I have no idea what it was, but it definitely wasn't an airplane because I clearly saw no wings.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Fast craft transformed multiple times and dropped off something that hovered in the sky.;2005-08-24 23:00:00;3 minutes;Fast craft transformed multiple times and dropped off something that hovered in the sky. A bunch of friends and I were at Knapp's Castle (ruins in the mountains near Santa Barbara) when my sister noticed a strange blinking white/yellow light in the sky coming from a westerly direction (over the ocean).   After maybe five to ten seconds it transformed into a string of three or four (I think it was three) lights moving in an east/southeast direction.  By this time the lights had stopped blinking. Then the last of the lights dropped off and moved away from the group.  This light stayed pretty much in the same area for the whole time and blinked.  The other group continued in an E/SE direction when suddenly it transformed again into a glowing red/orange ball.  The glow was like nothing I had ever seen before.   Then we noticed a trail behind it. The trail was not like the ones created by a jet, it was wide, but was more transparent.  It was moving faster than anything else in the sky.  All of a sudden it made a right turn toward the ocean and then another heading south.  Then it appeared to stop, giving the impression that it was heading away from Earth.  It then suddenly diminished in size until it had disappeared.  The last bit happened in less than a second and it was definitely moving away from us.  We had lost track of the blinking light and it was not visible in the sky. Seemed like it was a reconnaisance mission to deploy or drop off some sort of probe.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Black object tumbling and moving in sky over Santa Barbara, CA on June 25, 2009 7:15 pm;2009-06-25 19:15:00;10 minutes;Black object tumbling and moving in sky over Santa Barbara, CA on June 25, 2009 7:15 pm Sitting on the porch of the ((name deleted)) restaurant, located at the corner of Anacapa and Ortega Streets in Santa Barbara, CA, two witnesses sighted an unidentifiable object which appeared at times to be a flipping disc shape in the sky which exhibited a tumbling motion as it came straight toward us for about 3 minutes.   The object appeared to be very far away, as it tumbled or shifted shape, it also made very sudden and purposeful changes in direction.   The object moved primarily in a north-eastern direction.

Large orange light moves over Santa Barbara then moves toward the channel islands. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2011-04-14 21:26:00;4 minutes;Large orange light moves over Santa Barbara then moves toward the channel islands. From my back yard a long, orange, very bright light was coming straight in my direction (south east). I think it was at an altitude of 5 to 6 thousand feet high but it was hard to tell. My first thought was that it was a large meteor streaking in the sky but it didn't look to be descending at all. I thought it looked like a meteor because it was the color of fire and very large. It was totally silent. I ran across the yard and told my mom to come quick I see a UFO. Before she could get out side the object changed direction from coming directly to me and started moving toward the west over the ocean. As it moved it began to diminish in intensity and started to move faster. My mom and I began to try to explain what it could possibly be but it was clear it fit no identifiable explanation. As it continued to move westward it began to blink out then it would flare up again. It did this 3 or 4 times then just didn't come back. After it disappeared  my mom and I noticed that there was an unusually large number of airplanes in the sky. As we were looking around at the airplanes and commenting on the blinking lights and the differences from what we saw we noticed another strange light that didn't look like the other airplanes going almost directly over us heading north. As it got closer we noticed it was also totally silent and was a large triangle shaped craft (TR3-B I believe). We watched it continue slowly right over our heads and went directly over the mountains to our north. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 21:24 hrs. (Pacific).

Moving SEMI-VISIBLE striped waving object.;2013-08-20 16:00:00;>>5 minutes;Moving SEMI-VISIBLE striped waving object Hello, I saw something a few weeks ago just hasn't been sitting with me well. I remember being very tired that afternoon so I decided to lay down outside. I looked up to the left and saw a bright red light, but I realized that the light was flashing and there was a blue one right next to it.  Of course this was an airplane, however a few seconds later a smaller WHITE light flashed turning into a BURNING/ORANGE-EMBER color before somewhat disappearing. The reason I say somewhat is because after the light vanished I could literally see the SAME light when looking indirectly at this object as if it burned a hole in the sky. Very similar to how stars appear around early dusk.  Only slightly visible, however this object was clearly surrounded by some type of LIGHTLY GLOWING BLUEcloud or wavy membrane. This may sound odd as this scared the living hell out of me. This object just came right down to where I was, and as the object was moving I c! ould clearly see it had STRIPED/CHROMATIC colors tailing behind it. It seemed to happen instantaneously and I could see it hovering a couple hundred feet above my house, moments later. I was astonished at the complexity and clarity of what I was looking at even though I was not able to look directly at it and notice it.  The only way I can explain it was like seeing a previously unknown spectrum of light, if that makes any sense... This object appeared to have had waving, spaghetti-like strands in a double-helix pattern circling around it just before it zoomed off into  a cloud. This cloud expanded at least 10-15 x its size as 5 or 6 light colored objects flew in. That was the end of my unexpected encounter with a UFO. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and if anyone else out there is... know that we are powerful beings of light . We need not give into fear and intimidation if we are to get through these challenging times . With the universal power of love anything! is possible. - Light. Love. May the best be with you all.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Orange line above Santa Barbara, CA.;2014-08-13 06:15:00;10 minutes;Orange line above Santa Barbara I was driving South on Highway 101 Near Goleta California heading towards Santa Barbara. At about 6:15 AM (Pacific), on my right hand side to the North, I saw what appeared to be a rocket leaving the atmosphere.  It was an orange light that was difficult to gain focus on so I put on my glasses.   The light slowly changed to a line that was tilted up on the left side to about 50 degrees.  This line seemed to stay in the same spot and changed shape slightly as I was driving south.   After about 6 minutes the light seemed to gain momentum as it traveled East Southeast, eventually moving over the horizon. This glowing orange line seemed to be reflecting the rising sun which had not yet peaked over the mountain range.  It was not a celestial body as it moved far too fast.  That being said, this line was very high altitude and moving very fast. I am documenting this in case other saw the same thing, but it could easily have been a very rare anomaly that occurs naturally but I have never seen anything like it.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
