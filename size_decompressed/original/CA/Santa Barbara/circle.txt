At first they were in a V- formation then stretched out to an ungulating line. They ungulated about a thumbs length above the plane for quite awhile until the last orb zoomed to the front of the line and then they all disappeared. The line of orbs started above and in front of  the plane and trailed behind. The plane was about in the middle of the line. At first, the orbs were farther away in the V formation and were darker in color. They then swooped toward the plane and spread out and were shinnier (possibly sun reflection) Just the strangest thing we have ever seen. Not scary just odd. P.S. Are you on any other radio program? We sure miss you on Art's show. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates Santa Barbara, DC.  We presume she means California, and we have amended the report above.  PD));34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615

There was one light that was spinning around the ship. There was three wht. lights in the shape of a triangle (one at each point), one red light right in the middle. The ship was not very high, in the sky. It was about as high as a plain that is about to start landing. This took place in the night, there weren't other lights around ( like street lights) There wasn't a lot of star's out that night.  Later is seemed as if there was 2 to 3 more, in the sky, moving around.  But they were much higher in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Three bright orange orbs, equal distance from each other, moved slowly in a row, then stopped for several seconds before vanishing.;2012-08-10 21:15:00;2 minutes;Three bright orange orbs, equal distance from each other, moved slowly in a row, then stopped for several seconds before vanishing. My friend and I were returning home about 9:20pm, she driving, when I saw three very bright, seemingly round in shape, orange orbs moving in a row, not rapidly, not slowly, (about the speed of a small aircraft).  I called out and my friend looked also.   As I watched the three (about as far apart as the visual length of the big dipper) they stopped, simultaneously, and remained perfectly still for several seconds.  Before we could find a place to park and get out of the car to watch them more closely, they had vanished. My friend and I both have Masters level education as psychotherapists.  I am now retired. I enjoy studying the night sky and have been interested in ufology and extraterrestrials, although I am no expert.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
12 bright orange spheres moving slowly over the ocean in Santa Barbara, CA.;2012-08-18 21:00:00;30 minutes;12 bright orange spheres moving slowly over the ocean in Santa Barbara, CA. My wife and I watched approximately 12 very bright orange spheres move slowly across the southern sky above the ocean in Montecito (Santa Barbara), CA. We live approximately 1/2 mile from the ocean so it was impossible to tell if they were close to shore or farther out to sea.  Some moved horizontally while others moved diagonally upwards.  I was easily able to observe all of the spheres with my binoculars as they were moving slowly with no herky jerky movements.  In each case they simply vanished in the sky.  There were no clouds or fog to obstruct my view. My father was a mathematician/physicist at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in Pasadena, CA., so I grew up with a great telescope looking up at the sky.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615

Silver pulsating object.;2015-06-30 10:00:00;15 minutes;Silver pulsating object. I noticed a small metallic circular object in the North East sky.  I thought it was a foil balloon at first but I noticed that it was stationary for over 10 minutes, and it was pulsating from bright to dull at a precise rate that lasted for 10 minutes. If the object was a balloon I don't think it would have pulsated between bright and dull so precisely for such a long time.  I think it would have been a lot more random in its flickering of sunlight.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Yellowish orange, odd circular object observed over Santa Barbara Ca.;2015-07-19 22:12:00;2+ minutes;Yellowish orange, odd circular object observed over Santa Barbara, Ca. Leaving Santa Barbara airport, watched aircraft on aprouch to land when daughter noticed a odd object some distance behind.  At first thought it another plane.  Object was circular, a yellowish orange color and much larger then plane on aprouch.  As plane came in on glide slope to land, we noticed object drop straight down to about level of plane and get brighter as it got closer.  After about 2 min., object then changed direction (without turn or other movement) and went east.  We noticed a long comet like tail for several seconds before it quickly disapeared.  A few minutes later we saw the object again towards northwest as we headed north on hwy 101.  Object was higher in sky, brighter and quite large, about the size of a nickel held at arms length.  Watched object for about twenty more seconds till clouds obscured it.  Object was circular and brighter towards the edges.  No navigation or other lights observed.  Very odd looking thing.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
