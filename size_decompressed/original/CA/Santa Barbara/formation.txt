Four hazy circular white lights flew over Hope Ranch at 1:00 a.m., June 1971.;1971-06-30 01:00:00;~2 seconds;Four hazy circular white lights flew over Hope Ranch at 1:00 a.m., June 1971. In June, 1971, I was living with my family in Hope Ranch, below the La Cumbre Country Club hill.  I woke up at 1:00 a.m., and looked out my bedroom window towards the hill and the starry night sky above the hill.  That's when I saw what looked like four hazy white circular lights fly quickly over that area of night sky and out towards the ocean.  If you hold your right arm and hand straight out in front of you, then tilt your arm and hand 30 degrees to the left (tuck your thumb in), the four hazy white circular lights were about the size (and location relative to each other) of your right hand fingertips.  They were equally spaced in a perfect slanted line, like the right half of a V-shape (including the center point of the V being at the lower left).  Their spacing didn't change.  The lights flew by many times faster than any airplane or satellite I'd ever seen.  Could not have been spotlights because they didn't act like typical spotlights (no moving around or twirling, no spotlight beams).  The lights made no sound as they flew over.  Saw no evidence of anything going on at the country club at that time.  Using Google Earth, I've checked the lights' flight path relative to my former home's location and the location of the country club.   Conclusion: the lights were moving in a southeast direction, which means they were coming from the direction of Vandenberg AFB.  They may have flown over Vandenberg AFB, considering how fast they were going. Have not seen anything like that since, as of 05/03/19.

I was driving along the coast in Santa Barbara between 4 and 5 am this morning and noticed 2 strange lights hovering over the ocean very close to each other. They were in a diagonal formation and one was brighter than the other. It was hard to say how high they were hovering, but id say at around 1,000 feet above the water. I pulled into a parking lot on the beach to observe them to see what they were or if they were moving. I sat in my car for around 45 minutes listening to music and keeping an eye on the lights. They did not move. I proceeded home and was able to see them from my home until daylight a few hours later. I asked around about it and someone claimed to have seen the same light formation at 9 pm the same night. I attempted to take a photograph with my cell phone but there wasn't sufficient lighting.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
