Fireball;2009-01-19 17:00:00;seconds;A sudden fireball flash of an obvious head and tail streaked across Santa Barbara Bay from east to west. It may have been an asteroid, but it was seen while we were driving south on the 101 fwy prior to dusk. It seemed to disappear right across the city to the ocean. I have been lucky as this has been my second sighting within months. The first was in Bend, Oregon also driving on the fwy. before dusk on 12/3/08.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
An orange ball of light, (possible fireball), above ocean.;2011-09-09 20:00:00;1 1/2 min;An orange ball of light, (possible fireball), above ocean. My Husband and I were sitting on our porch when we noticed an orange light, which was bright enough to be a spotlight, but had no directionality to the light.  It was always an orange fire color. In fact it looked almost as if it could have been on fire, with the way it pulsed and grew and dimmed with light.  It was moving slower than an airplane, and much to slow to be a shooting star.  There was no noise from light at all.  It was moving west then either dimmed out or turned south and moved away so quickly it seemed to go out.  That was just as another plain came into our area, as we are in the landing path of the Santa Barbara Airport.  It all took place with in a min-min and a half.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Meteor-like object broke up into three pieces then a bright light appeared where it ended it's travel.;2012-10-19 19:15:00;1 minute;Meteor-like object broke up into three pieces then a bright light appeared where it ended it's travel. Driving west out of Santa Barbara towards Santa Ynez along Lake Cachuma, my two kids, 10 and 6 yrs of age, and I witnessed what initially appeared as a meteor which started at twenty five degrees of elevation in the west and traveled toward the northern horizon.  It travelled slower than all other meteors that I have seen.  Approximately thirty degrees of sky were traveled in eight or ten seconds.  Toward the end of travel the object broke into three pieces of white light and extinguished.  Within a few seconds a light of magnitude -4 (like Venus) appeared in the vicinity of the extinguishing point of the meteor-like object and remained stationary.  This light disappeared after fifteen seconds or so and a flashing light of magnitude 2 (like Mercury) appeared five degrees above the brighter light location.  This light disappeared after ten seconds.   Having grown up in the Davenport, Washington area myself High Five to Peter Davenport!;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Curving fireball followed by blinking light.;2017-04-26 00:00:00;1:30;curving fireball followed by blinking light. the first craft was a fireball, the second craft was a blinking light. i assumed the second craft was following the fireball but they appeared to separate when i first noticed them. craft number 2 gave me the impression it was ours... but at first, when they separated, it looked like pieces breaking off, which did happen later with the fireball, but they changed speeds and gathered distance really quickly. About 30 seconds after they separated, the fireball also slowed down and started to turn outward from the california coast and i assume upward, or still, based on the angle because it slowly faded.  But maybe 45 seconds before the fireball died, the blinking light disappeared after pulsing rhythmically for the first 45 seconds.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Bright green fireball flew across the sky;2019-12-11 19:00:00;2 seconds;Bright green fireball flew across the sky Looked up into the sky just above the Santa Barbara foothills and watched a green glowing object descend at a high rate of speed, not sure of the degree angle but it would have moved from the 10 o’clock position to the 4 o’clock position and was lost behind the foothills. It was only in view for a second. This is the second time I have seen this type of activity in the same area. Not sure if it was a ufo, a meteor or one of Vandenburg’s rockets coming down.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
