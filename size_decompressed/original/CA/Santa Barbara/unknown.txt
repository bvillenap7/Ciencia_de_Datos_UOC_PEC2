Fast flying object in Santa Barbara;1971-07-04 19:00:00;10 minutes;Fast flying object in Santa Barbara It was July 4th, and not yet dark.  I was in the tallest building in Santa Barbara, where the radio station was.  I was in the control booth.  I was looking out towards the ocean.  From where I was, you could see the bay and on either side were hills that come up.  Often times you see private plans flying or an occasional airliner descending to the airport further north.  What I saw this day was a very fast moving object that covered the distance between the two hill rises (on either sides of the bay) faster than any plane, or commercial jet could.  It was also lower in the horizon than planes flying in the vicinity.  I asked the DJ, did you see that?  They had not.  I was then transfixed at the window.  I wanted to see it again.  Lo and behold, it came back the opposite direction about five minutes later.  That's it.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615

two lights over santa barbara mountains;2007-06-22 22:00:00;20+ minutes;two lights over santa barbara mountains Looking South-Southwest from Goleta, Ca. toward Ventura. I saw a bright white light over the local mountain range.  I thought it was a passenger jet with its bright lights on but it was not in the usual flight path going to the Santa Barbara Airport, and then I noticed it wasn’t moving closer as a jet should have been.  It just stayed over the mountains.   I thought maybe it was headlights from a car on Gibraltar Road but it could not have been a car because of the size of the light and the distance it was.  Then another light showed up but it wasn’t as big or as bright and it also lingered. Then the brighter light disappeared for a few seconds then it reappeared.  I watched for 20 minutes or more but could not reconcile in my mind what the heck it was.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615

It was moving towards the WNW over Santa Barbara, CA at a constant rate and was orange in color.  It also appeared that small whitish specs were falling off the sides at irregular intervals.  At least 3 planes were visible at the time to compare for size and shape, and this was not a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

2 very fast silent objects pass over being followed by a helicopter.;2013-04-09 21:15:00;a few seconds;2 very fast silent objects pass over being followed by a helicopter 04/09/2013  Approx: 9:00pm-9:15  Duration: seconds  Two objects  Santa Barbara California, near Cottage Hospital.      It was dark out, and a friend and I were walking down the street.  We paused to watch a helicopter leaving from the Cottage hospital heli pad.  In the past week or so many different agencies have been making landings, more than normal.  I assume they are practice runs for the pilots. The helicopter passed out of site towards the south.  I turned around and looked up (I like to look at the stars) when a very fast completely silent object with one dim white light on the bottom passed over heading west.  I got excited and was yelling at my friend to look up.  I pointed towards it and it faded into the night.   As I was asking if my friend had seen it, another very fast completely silent object with 2 dim white lights one in the front and one in back passed overhead in the same direction and speed as the other object.  I yelled at my friend to look, and again it was gone. A few moments later I heard the sound of a helicopter coming from the east,  It soon came into view.  Much more slowly than the other 2 objects it passed overhead in the exact same direction as the two strange objects.  Their were many lights on the helicopter just like all the aircraft we see at night. I had seen a silhouette of the two unidentified objects, but the shape was vague.  The two objects were different somehow (one with one light and the other with 2)   Yet they were obviously the same. Vandenberg airforce base is a one hour car ride in the same direction the objects were travelling.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615

Three stars that formed a triangle moving slowly then fading out.;2021-02-13 19:30:00;30 seconds;Three &quotstars&quot that formed a triangle moving slowly then fading out. I was pacing around my front porch, on the phone with my cousin. It was about 7:30pm. She was talking to me about our aunt, as she's talking to me I stare up at the night sky and I see this really bright star to the left of our big sticky gum tree, which caught my attention. As she is talking I move over to my left to get a clear view and notice that the bright star that formed a small triangle with two other fainter looking stars. As my cousin is still talking to me, I'm staring at (what I thought was a constellation) the triangle of stars, the top star looked like it was moving. I then realize that all three stars that formed the small triangle were slowly moving downward. I then interrupted my cousin to explain what I was seeing, as I was talking to her the three star looking objects slowly faded out, with the brightest light that was on the left being the last to fade into nothing.  After I hung up, I went on a skymap app I have on my phone, to try and map out where I saw the triangle of lights. The small triangle of lights looked like it was in a larger triangle of stars. Which I believe was, Y Uma (the point), Dubhe (bottom left), Merak (bottom right).  I have never seen anything CLOSE to a UFO before. I'm still trying to rationalize this!;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
