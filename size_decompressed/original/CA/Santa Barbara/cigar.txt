I looked out my balcony and a large orange stick like thing was in the sky to the south. It was coming down and then stopped and hung there for a few seconds and then started to desend until it was lost in the city & harbor lights. It was say 18 inches at arms length and straight up and down. Very orange and very bright. It went very slowly. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Peter, This was told to me by one of my customers after I told her of my sighting. She is very reliable, but she didn't want to tell you herself. She was really concerned and very glad I brought it up. Hope you have had a chance to get some rest. Thanks again.

Bright orange vertical cigar shaped something at 45 deg. slowly drop into ocean?;1999-09-01 22:30:00;5 sec.;Bright orange vertical cigar shaped something at 45 deg. slowly drop into ocean? At approx 10:30pm Wed. 9/1, I saw an orange something that I thought was an airplane on fire and going slowly down towards the ocean. Facing SW just under and slightly to the right of the constellation Sagittarius at about 45 degrees. It wasn't shooting as fast as meteorites I have seen and it was wider then tails I've seen and definately orange from tip to tip. It was 6 at arms length. It was a ball type front that didn't taper down to the tail. I am searching the skys all the time and never saw anything like this. I know this is fragmented, but I don't know how else to explain it. FYI. Thanks for your continued good work.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
