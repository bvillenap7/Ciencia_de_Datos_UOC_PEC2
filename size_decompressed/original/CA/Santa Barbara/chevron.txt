Huge boomerang-shaped object seen over San Marcos Pass/Highway 154.;2001-01-02 17:00:00;1 minute;Huge boomerang-shaped object seen over San Marcos Pass/Highway 154. I was travelling back from the Santa Barbara area over Highway 154 (Northeast, towards the Santa Ynez Valley) when both my mother (the driver of our vehicle) and myself (seated in the passenger seat) witnessed a very low flying, extremely large, boomerang shaped craft fly over the mountain top.  We witnessed it approximately 1 mile or 1-1/2 miles ahead and above us. Highway 154 is a curvaceous road that has been cut into the contours of the Los Padres Forest mountains overlooking Santa Barbara, California.  At the top of the pass there is a sort of gouge or small cleft in the mountain tops, where the pass reaches its summit before descending into the Santa Ynez Valley. It was my mother who first pointed the craft out to me.  We had our car windows rolled up.  Therefore, we were unable to discern at to whether or not the craft made any noise.  It caught my attention for a number or reasons.  Some of which I outline below. 1.  It was larger than any conventional aircraft that I know of, including the huge military personel and equipment carrier planes that occassionally are seen flying from the vicinity of Vandenberg Airforce Base (Lompoc, California = approximately 35-45 miles from the Los Padres Forest witness site). 2.  It was boomerang or chevron shaped, much the same as pictures I have seen of stealth bombers.  I could roughly make out its shape because of the time of day in which it was seen.  The event took place during dusk/sunset.  I watched it fly and then bank near the summit of the Santa Barbara side of Hwy. 154.  I watched it on this side of the mountain for approximately 30-40 seconds. 3.  I have never seen anything, other than a rare helicopter, fly so close to the summit/mountain top.  The craft was witnessed by us to be heading over the summit of the 154 pass, towards the Santa Ynez Valley.  It was approximately 200-300 feet from the summit/mountain top.  This placed it very close to the cleft in the mountain pass when it banked to the right.  This banking maneuver struck me as unusual for something so large.  I brought this to the attention of my mother. 4.  It had 3 white lights at each point of its chevron shape.  This also struck me as unusual because I am under the awareness that all conventional aircraft must use red and green lights.  As the craft made the banking maneuver it turned on some red lights which seemed to pulse more than to blink.  These were only on a few seconds.  My mother witnessed these also.  Thereafter, on the Santa Ynez side of the mountains, at a distance of about 3+ miles, I witnessed the object for a short time  (approximately 20-30 more seconds) to be flying very close to the ridge tops of some neighboring foothills.  I pointed out to my mother that I thought that the object was SO large still, even though it was getting further away from us.  Its sheer size is and was a mystery to me.  When I viewed it after it had banked it no longer had any red lights on (only the aforementioned white).  Total sighting time (including Santa Barbara and Santa Ynez sides of the mountains) = 1+ minutes. FYI:  I am almost 30 years old, college educated and employed in the medical field.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Three round chevron-formation lights in Santa Barbara sky March 24, 2008 at 8:30 p.m.;2008-03-24 20:30:00;15-20 seconds;Three round chevron-formation lights in Santa Barbara sky March 24, 2008 at 8:30 p.m. I was on an after-dinner walk with my family in Santa Barbara, Calif., at approximately 8:30 p.m., March 24, 2008. We were naming the constellations, when we noticed three, not-very-bright lights (outlining a chevron--one light at the point, two lights at either end of the chevron)cruising very smoothly and at amazing speed through the sky. I thought it was a airplane, but there were no flashing lights. The lights were round and chalk-colored. My husband, both of my young children and I witnessed the lights. The lights flew above us (at the height of a low-flying airplane) and then seemed to speed up and, instead of lowering in the north near our airport, whisked away into the upper reaches of the sky until we couldn't see them anymore.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
My boyfriend and I were riding our bikes along the oceanfront heading east along the Santa Barbara coastline around 9pm when we stopped;2009-05-14 21:00:00;30 minutes on and off.;My boyfriend and I were riding our bikes along the oceanfront heading east along the Santa Barbara coastline around 9pm when we stopped for a moment on the adjoining grass to talk, I was speaking to him when he first saw movement in the sky, he told me he saw a diamond/triangle shaped craft flying over us, I thought he was being funny and didn’t look up but then realized by the look on his face that he wasn’t joking. We had already witnessed two orange orbs in the same area about a month ago so I looked up and a few seconds later I saw one for myself except it was a “boomerang” shaped craft with 5 orange lights one at the tip, one on each end and one on the center of each “arm” it was difficult to tell how high it was flying but I would guess approx. 3,000-4,000 feet, about as high as the local mountains. It was larger than an airplane next to a full moon I would estimate it to be about a sixth of the size. It flew NW and disappeared into the clouds. I kept looking up into the sky when we both saw another (or the same, I’m not sure) object flying NE, then from the opposite direction one of the same size and shape came towards it, I thought they were going to collide but they instead seemed to merge into each other and become one larger object which then changed shape the orange lights on both objects began to sort of swirl around then the craft(s) took on a double diamond shaped appearance before flying off in a NW direction. We then went back to our apartment about 7 blocks away once there I witnessed another chevron or “boomerang” shaped object flying south through the sky from our front patio. At that point we decided to get our digital camera to try and record the objects and went back outside. I saw the chevron shaped object at least two other times, once flying north and then south. At this point we went outside to the street for a better view. A couple of minutes later I witnessed another chevron shaped object that appeared to be larger and flying lower than the others. It also had the orange lights on the bottom, more than the first, however this time the lights seemed to be moving in a very coordinated pattern, as I watched the lights seemed to swirl around each other in circles. There was absolutely no noise from any of these objects. Unfortunately our camera was unable to pick up the video we tried to record, however we’ve decided to take it with us when we go out riding now just in case. I will update if we see anything else. ((NUFORC Note:  I spoke with these witnesses, and they sounded to me to be quite sincere, and serious-minded.  PD));34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Large Chevron shaped craft and bright Orbs over Santa Barbara, CA.;2010-04-22 22:50:00;15 seconds;Large Chevron shaped craft and bright Orbs over Santa Barbara, CA. At approximately 10:50PM on 4/22/10, I stepped out on my balcony like I do almost every night just to get some fresh air. I walked down to the far end of the balcony towards my neighbors front door, I turned around to come back to my area of the balcony, and as I turned I rested my hands on the wooded side of the balcony, and I looked up. I noticed a dark shadow moving west directly above me very slowly. As my eyes began to focus, I clearly saw the outline of a very large rounded boomerang shape ship with no lights. I could make out the outline very well. I would guessed it to be flying at between 2500-3000 feet, because it appeared to be lower than the mountains, which are around 3200 feet. The ship was more rounded like a half a circle with sharp points or horns coming off of it, sort of like a Chinese throwing star. It was low enough that it was reflecting light off of the bottom part of the ship. From the reflection I could clearly see that it was a sliv! er/light color. The object slowly faded away in the distance. The entire experience was surreal and very eerie.  On the same night at 11:05PM, I also saw 2 bright orbs connected to one another to what appeared to be a rod of some sort. They traveled in the same direction as the other object, however they moved much faster, and the objects appeared to circle each other as it moved across the sky heading west. This object was also seen by my fiance whom just arrived home from work.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
