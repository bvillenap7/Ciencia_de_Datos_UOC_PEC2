3 circular lights with orange tail & sudden white flash over Santa Barbara.;2013-11-06 21:49:00;10 seconds;3 circular lights with Orange tail & sudden white flash over Santa Barbara On November 6, 2013, I was driving south on the 101 in Santa Barbara California along the Pacific coast in light traffic.  The sky was dark as there are no lights illuminating the coastal highway.   At 7:49 pm as I passed the Sheffield Rd. exit, three parallel circular white lights trailing an orange streak suddenly blazed across the night sky and then burst with a flash of intense white light and then the arc of light rapidly disappeared.   The movement was from North to South, across the highway and out across the ocean, and lasted only about 10 seconds.  I thought, Oh my God a plane exploded and is going down, but there was no evidence of any crisis on the sea or in the sky following that.   On reflection I found it strange, too, that there had been no sound given how intensely bright the streak and burst had been. I am a 57-year old female professor.  I have never seen any other such phenomenon.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Pulse of green streaking through sky very quicky for short duration.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  PD));2014-10-10 18:30:00;1 second;pulse of green streaking through sky very quicky for short duration. I was on a sunset boat trip from Santa Barbara,.  I looked up and saw a green flash/pulse streak across the sky, it was similar to seeing a shooting star but was rich in  green colour.   I am an airline pilot and have never seen such a phenomena before.   Another guy on the boat witnessed it.   Very strange, would love to hear some possible explanations, military test area?  Pulse engine technology?  Or a strange shooting star? ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  PD));34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
High altitude flashing white light that hovered and appeared to be approached by much larger object.  ((anonymous report));2018-02-19 04:30:00;10 minutes;High altitude flashing white light that hovered and appeared to be approached by much larger object before disappearing. Blinking white light object never moved in the sky appeared to be very high altitude.  Object blinked  approximately once every 10 seconds.  It was not visible between flashes.    After approximately 10 minutes it looked like another much larger craft approached and both disappeared.  This happened at a very high altitude and I didn't see anything definitively but it was very unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Abnormal flashing object in SoCal.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-06 20:45:00;5 minutes;Abnormal flashing object in SoCal As an avid skywatcher since birth (51 hrs), I take pride in my recognition skills concerning flying objects.  While relaxing on my back porch after a long day of work I noticed what appeared to be a flashing satellite.  The trajectory was circumpolar and velocity was consistant with average satellites.  The object was first noticed at the zenith.  The first flash was of approximately -6 magnitude brightness and lasted 3 seconds.  So far this seemed normal for a rotating solar paneled satellite.  Every 22 seconds the object flashed at a consistent magnitude until it disappeared over the northern horizon.   The odd thing is the flashing was consistent brightness as though the light was radiating all directions.  Normal rotating satellites will flash at most twice before the change in orbital position relative to the observer makes the solar panels flash to a single spot on the earth's surface.  The next flash would be hundreds of miles away from the observer one would think.   This is the first time Iâ€™ve seen this phenomenon and have seen thousands of satellites in my skywatching. This is my 23rd unexplainable sighting of aerial phenomena. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Repeat of last night.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-07 20:55:00;5 minutes;Repeat of last night Apologies if the previous report was sent twice.  Regarding the latter, I witnessed a nearly identical uap to the one witnessed last night.  The trajectory and apparent velocity were the same however the flash frequency was about 60 s rather than 22 s. i.e. the object flashed 5 times tonight and 11-12 last night.  Direction was nw. Flash brightness was constant from zenith to mountainous horizon.  This is not possible with a rotating satellite unless its axis of rotation is changing with my location as tangent wrt the sun. . This is exceedingly unlikely. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
