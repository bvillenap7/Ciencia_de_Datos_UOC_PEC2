A  bright ball of light hovered for a couple minutes;2004-04-23 09:15:00;2 minutes;A  bright ball of light hovered for a couple minutes At about 9:15 AM I was having my coffee out in the backyard when I noticed a ball of light climbing slowly in the sky.  It seemed to be at a very high altitude and far away.  As it climbed a little higher, it stopped and hovered in the same spot for about 2 minutes. I ran inside to grab my video camera but when I came back it was gone. It was a crystal clear day with no clouds to obstruct my view. I live towards the coast and saw this object high over the mountains to the east.  This is the third time I have seen this kind of light in the sky.  I had previously seen it 2 months ago during evening ours. During these occurences, the light was extremely bright, it hovered for about a minute or two, then took off to the east, disappearing very fast. I live close to Vandenburg AFB, so i'm thinking it might be test flights of some kind. Hopefully someone else saw this or has seen the same thing. Please let me know. ((NUFORC Note:  The only launch from Vandenberg AFB we are aware of was of the Gravity B satellite, which was launched April 20, 2004.  PD));34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Bright light that vanished;2005-11-11 17:00:00;5 min;Bright light that vanished At 5:00 pm I saw a bright (like that of Venus) object hanging in the sky to the North, over the Santa Ynez Mountains at about the 11:00 o'clock position (not quite overhead.)  It simply vanished after five minutes. The object was brilliant white and seemed to hang and twinkle.  Some slight motion seemed to happen, but this could have been my eyes.  No shape was discernable, though it was not point-like. it seemed to have planet-like girth.  I know the night sky well and for a brief second thought it could be Polaris (was in the same general direction) but it was still too light out and no other stars were visible.  When it vanished, I knew something unusual was up.  It was not moving like a satellite, though I cannot rule out a large geo-synchronous object of some sort (ISS?) This could be checked I suppose.  It seemed to be lower than a star.  I can't say that for sure of course, but it appeared inside the atmosphere.  I do not have the ability to judge altitude.  The sky was perfectly clear and a few planes flew near it but made no approach.  After it disappeared, an old bomber looking plane flew over.  That was unusual but may have no bearing whatsoever on the sighting.  For the record, it was NOT Venus or any other planet.  Wrong side of the sky, way outside the orbital plane.   I'm only making this report because this was an unusal event and perhaps other people saw it... ((NUFORC Note:  Given the witness's experience with viewing the nighttime sky, we agree with his assessment that the object almost certainly could not have been a celestial body, i.e. a star or planet.  However, we have to address the possibility that the light might have been the landing light on an approaching a/c, possibly the bomber-like plane.  However, that is just a guess.

some stars are ufos.....;2006-01-28 05:00:00;2-5 minutes;some stars are ufos..... This month of January I've been seeing alot of ufo's in the sky during my paper route. They appear to be stars at first and once you lock your vision on the star it begins to move. Sometimes I see one star move and pass another star and then that one starts moving also...?! They always fly VERY high and fly out into space until the light dims out. From comparing 'high flying alltitude' planes I would guess they are moving atleast 1000-2000 mph.  there is also a telepathic connection between the lights and myself before and during the sightings. I believe these sighting are end times signs in the heavens and all of you who read this please take time and look into the sky and ask them directly....they are up there, have patience and you will see them.....

Bright light after sunset in Southern California;2007-09-17 17:30:00;1 minute;Bright light after sunset in Southern California My friend and I witnessed a bright light in the sky on Monday September 17, 2007 at approximately 7:30-7:45 pm.  We did not check our watch, but Venus was very visible and few other stars were showing. The light was about equal in brightness to Venus and did not appear to be moving. There was no visible trail, and we thought it was another bright planet.  It was approximately 45 degrees off of the horizon.  After observing the light for approximately 15 seconds, the light vanished and a white haze lingered in its location for less than a minute. The location of the light was almost due north, as I noted the direction and compared it to the presence of the North Star and big dipper once they appeared.  We were located on a boat at the Channel Islands in Southern California.  Specifically, we were anchored at smugglers cove on the east end of Santa Cruz Island, and the light appeared above Santa Barbara. My first thoughts were that it may be a satellite, but I have never seen a satellite that was that bright.  The white haze had me thinking that it was a missile or rocket launch from Vandenberg AFB, but my research so far shows no launches that evening.  I have seen missile launches before and have seen a haze after the rocket left the atmosphere, but this did not appear to be moving and there was no contrail.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Dim Green Lights viewed in the University of California, Santa Barbara;2009-05-15 21:05:00;20 seconds;Dim Green Lights viewed in the University of California, Santa Barbara I was walking directly under the Santa Barbara flight path, when an airplane was taking off. The airplane was heading in a north direction and some hundred feet away you could see a set of dim green lights trailing behind it, but then the UFO quickly changed directions, heading east. The actual body of the moving object was vague but a I could make out  a sphere like shape with particularly, the three green but dim lights.

Sighting of orbs after report of large boomerang shaped craft.;2010-04-22 23:05:00;On and off 30 minutes.;Sighting of orbs after report of large boomerang shaped craft. On Thursday, April 22 my fiancee called me and asked me to come home as soon as possible around 10:55 pm. He said that he had witnessed a boomerang shaped craft flying low over our apartment. (around 3500-5000ft.) This has not been the first time we have witnessed an event like this, we had a similar one last year. When I came home he explained to me that he had seen a large craft flying overhead. We are used to seeing planes fly over us all of the time and he knew that this was not a plane. Also from our previous experience last year I assumed that if I waited outside long enough I might see something else, which I did. Flying north towards the mountains, off to my right, there were two slightly glowing orange orbs circling each other in formation. This is when I called to report the event. Then about ten minutes later a single orb flew in the same direction off to my left. Then again about 5 minutes later another one flew over but seemed to vanish as I was! looking at it and I could no longer trace its flight path. They were much like the orange orbs I had seen last year however not as bright and this time they were flying much closer to the ground. I would say lower than planes yet higher than birds if that makes sense.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615

My girlfriend and I were at the East Beach in Santa Barbara adjacent to Cabrillo Beach House and Grill. We were both lying face-up and;2012-10-14 16:45:00;15 minutes;My girlfriend and I were at the East Beach in Santa Barbara adjacent to Cabrillo Beach House and Grill.  We were both lying face-up and talking.   At some point, we noticed two intense pink-red light moving slowly across the sky towards the direction of Los Angeles (i.e., along the coast).  We thought, at first, that they were military aircraft because they seem to move in formation.  We both thought it was strange because it was a sunny day and all the other airplanes would have appeared white (instead of red).   A number of planes criss-crossed the skies at various altitudes but we could always make out the fact that they were planes because of the shape.  These other things were just...lights.   Then, after about 5 minutes, these lights disappeared in the distance.  But here's the strange part - after a couple minutes (maybe 5) two pink-red lights appeared AGAIN!  They appeared in the same position and same &quotformation&quot (i.e., one was ahead of the other the! trailing light to the left of the leading &quotobject&quot) as before and moved in the same direction as before.  They seem to be very high up in the sky (as before) and left no trails and made no perceptible noise.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Orange light over Santa Barbara;2013-05-24 21:25:00;4 minutes;Orange light over Santa Barbara No craft.  One orange light, like a flame glowing.  No noise. We are up on the Riviera.  It was up above the city, in from the ocean, but with the ocean and full moon in the background on a clear night.  It was in a direct line up from our bedroom french door looking out to the ocean.   It was lower than the moon--in a straight line from our window to start.  Opened the door and walked to deck to watch it. It was still about a minute, don't know how long it had been there.  It then rose very slowly, one orange light.  It was not a perfect oval, but it was round.  It was slightly oblong, longer horizontal than vertical.  No smoke.  It traveled slowly in an upward direction and slightly to the right, a bright dark orange glow like a fire flame.  The glow maintained it's color as it rose slowly up in a line.  After a few minutes it was moving higher up and finally becoming distant and getting smaller.  Near the end of the sighting from the distance it looked possible to then ! be composed of three lights together but couldn't tell because of the distance.  It finally disappeared.  All at the same slow deliberate pace.  Our neighbors saw it too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615

No blinking indicator lights or other colored lights. Initially thought it was a shooting star due to the solid white light with no blinking or other colored lights.  However, it continued on an Easterly path with no diminishment of light.  Possible aircraft but another high altitude aircraft past beneath by a considerable distance and it had blinking red lights and the white light was somewhat yellow and the intensity diminished as it passed, also the aircraft made noise where the white object had no sound..

Bright, circular light moving slowly across NW sky, suddenly shrank into space.;2014-08-25 20:20:00;20 seconds;Bright, circular light moving slowly across NW sky, suddenly shrank into space. Friend visiting.  We were outside.  I looked NNE, just looking for planets.  I saw a round white light in that direction slowly moving NE.  At first I thought it was the ISS, but knew that it would be traveling along our horizon from W to NW tonight the opposite direction from where I was seeing this bright light. It then began to get smaller and shrink into the night sky, as if it were heading out into space.  I tapped on my friend's shoulder telling her, Look, look!, but by the time she turned around, it was gone.   It was approximately 20 seconds from first sighting it to when it disappeared.

A red-orange, star-shaped, mobile object shining in the sky.;2015-02-05 00:40:00;5 minutes;A red-orange, star-shaped, mobile object shining in the sky. Midnight-ish of February 5th, in UCSB (University of California Santa Barbara), my friend and I were looking out to the ocean (southward), when we spotted a star-shaped, red-orange object in the sky.  It looked as if it was slowly swaying inconsistently left to right, and perhaps drifting closer to us.  A bit concerned (perhaps frightened) we ran inland to where it eventually vanished. The object was alone and, to our knowledge, was not preceded nor succeeded (we checked for succession) by any other objects of its kind.  It emitted five (natural) rays of light (not beams or searchlights) that almost shaped in a star, with one ray shining upward and the other four fanning downward. A plane flew by shortly after.  We considered it may have been the aircraft emitting the light, but immediately decided against it as it flew in from the opposite part of the sky, and was in no way close to illuminating as bright as the red-orange glow.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615

Mysterious green light seen during fireworks celebration.;2016-07-04 21:15:00;10 minutes;Mysterious green light seen during fireworks celebration. Last night there was a fireworks show in the Santa Barbara harbor.  A group of us were watching it from the Riviera hillside overlooking the city and harbor.  A few minutes into the show my attention was diverted to a green light ascending rapidly off the coast a couple of miles southeast of the harbor. It was traffic light green and appeared to be round. After a rapid vertical ascent of thousands of yards it stopped.  It stayed stationary for a couple of minutes, then resumed another vertical ascent up to about 35 degrees above the horizon.  Then it stopped again.  Another couple of minutes passed and it began a very deliberate descent (not floating like a flare might do) to roughly where it had initially stopped.  Another couple of minutes passed and it wobbled side-to-side briefly, then descended straight down to either the ocean or near the ocean, then the light blinked out.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
