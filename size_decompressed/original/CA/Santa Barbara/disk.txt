multiple ship sighting in Santa Barbara;1975-08-19 01:00:00;15 minutes;multiple ship sighting in Santa Barbara a friend and I were hiking from our small farm in the Los Padres National Forest to a friends farm in Cuyama Valley. We made camp half way through the journey. In the middle of the night, I became completely awake and looked up to my left. I saw a large disc shape craft that had what looked like portholes with, what looked like a ball of light going around it. When the light went around the back of the vehicle, the light could be seen glowing over the hull. I shook the girl I was hiking with and told her to look up in the sky. She lifted he head up and then plopped back down - not interested. As I continued to watch, I noticed there were about nine samller discs coming toward the larger disc at about the 2:00 height. They weren't lighted, but I could see them against the backdrop of stars. As they were nearly to the hull of the larger disc, it began to evaperate. As the smaller unlit disc entered into the are where the larger disc was, they disappeared from light also. We wouold also see disc shaped clouds over our heads while working on our ranch. It would often be windy and the disc shaped cloud was often close - about the height you to throw a ball - and wouold sit stationary, while the clouds were flying by. The perimeter of the disc shaped cloud was cleary defined and looked like it had energy radiating off of it. We were always happy to have them around. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Hovered, slight climb, hover, slight climb. Lights flash about every three minutes. Color grey to black, black to grey. My name is ((name deleted)), age 47.  First sighting.  Retired.  My wife noticed object out of bedroom window looking north over mountains.  She told me to come quick and see it.  We both observed it for approximately 15 minutes.  I saw it as a disk, color light grey, than dark grey, then black. It kept changing color.  Altitude was approx. 1500- to 2500 feet. Kept hovering.  Saw flash of light from it on two occasions. Very sudden bright flash like a flash bulb going off. We were able to go outside and view it as it gained altitude.  My wife got a picture of it. It's distance from us was hard to determine.  Could have been one to three miles away.  I reported it to our local police department and they in turn gave me your hotline number where I obtained this website address.  We have tried to understand what if anything could it be.  We are convinced that is truly was a UFO sighting.  You can contact me at 805-((number deleted)).  Sincerely.

Played peek-a -boo behind a cloud, common for Santa Barbara.;2001-05-16 13:00:00;45 sec.;Played peek-a -boo behind a cloud, common for Santa Barbara. Played peek-a-boo with me and my friend behind a cloud by the mountains. Observed from a tree house. We also used binoculars and noted the craft was smooth and black. When I talked to others in the area they had seen similar things but at different times. Appeared to zoom off after 45 sec. I was in third grade at the time.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
2 Fling Discs Seen In Santa Barbara 1-5-02;2002-01-05 09:30:00;7 Minutes;2 Fling Discs Seen In Santa Barbara 1-5-02 We videotaped 2 objects that hung in the sky for 7 or eight minutes.  They did not appear to be moving then they moved in and out of each other.  They then disspeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the objects were that the witness describes, but the description of the two objects coming together make us wonder whether the sighting might be an artifact of the camera's focussing system.  When a video camera is set on Auto Focus, if it is used during darkness, the lens will hunt for something to focus on, and double images will result.  They can be seen in the viewfinder, and on the film.  PD));34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
Single saucer shaped object in sky, just before sunset.  Strange energy field emitted, making it difficult to see clearly.;2002-10-27 17:00:00;10 Minutes;Single saucer shaped object in sky, just before sunset.  Strange energy field emitted, making it difficult to see clearly. Date: 10/27/2002 Time: 17:00 Weather Conditions: Clear late afternoon, no breeze Temperature: 60-65ยบ F Location: Lower East Side of Santa Barbara, CA Number of Witnesses: 3 Description of Event: Three of us were taking a break from work on a Sunday evening outside of our software development company.  I noticed something reflecting in the sky that hadn't moved in the last 30 seconds.  I have spotted many satellites in our skies but this was different, due to the intensity of the reflection and the time of day.  It was 30 + minutes from sunset, the time that satellites are spotted in our skies.  Also, unlike satellites, it was oscillating between reflections, as if it were spinning.  This struck me as strange and highly unusual for skies.  Something else of note is that we had all just commented on how much activity was in the sky.  Not vehicular, but almost as if the sky were alight with an energy that was beyond the usual intensity.  It had almost a vibration to it. I called to my co-workers to have a look.  It took a moment for them to spot it and once they did, they too commented on the strangeness of its pattern.  I had a pair of 20x binoculars in the car so I grabbed them.  I fixed on a stable surface and peered into the bright blue sky.  What I say was the unexpected.  It was a disc angled in such a way as I could see the bottom as well as a good deal of the top.  To best describe it, it looks very much like the typical UFO that has been depicted many times, by many people.  The Disk had a slight warble to it and it stayed in a fixed position.  There were dark spots around the upper half they looked like what would be windows or some form of exterior ventilation.  I described what I saw and the others decided to have a look.  As a little background, I have extraordinary vision.  It has been rated at 40/20.  In other words, I see at 40 feet what most see at 20. They stared with amazement.  Though they couldn't see the full clarity as I could, they could make out exactly what I was seeing.  We continued to take turns looking at it with the naked eye and through the binoculars.  As the minutes passed, the previously mentioned phenomenon of the increased energy in the sky began to grow stronger.  It was almost as if the color of the sky intensified significantly.  It became increasingly difficult to focus on the portion of the sky that the UFO was located.  We had to avert our eyes many times due to the power emitted.  Then, all of a sudden, it was gone.  There wasn't a trace.  The sky also resumed its normal brilliance though to our eyes everything took on a glummer hue. This may not be the most fantastic form of a tale but it really did happen.  After that, the three of us shared a couple of stories of previous encounters, or at the very least, we thought them to be encounters.  To this day, we talk about the strangeness of the event.  Was it some form of US military operation with a new high tech tool, or was it in fact what we really think it to be.  We may never know, but we figured we would share it, in the event others saw it too.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
My family and I observer a silver disk shaped object moving in a straight line turning end-over-end.;2003-08-24 11:30:00;15 min.;My family and I observer a silver disk shaped object moving in a straight line turning end-over-end. As my family and I were leaving a restaurant, we observed a disk shaped object moving toward us in a southwesterly direction. It was moving in a straight line  flipping slowly end-over-end.  One side was a dark color and the other was silver and reflected irredescent colors.  We watched the object for approximately 15 minutes  before continuing on to our destination. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found he testimony quite compelling.  Please see similar reports from Santa Barbara and Laguna Niguel for May 11, 2003.  Witness here reports a sighting of seemingly identical object over Santa Barbara in July, as well.  PD));34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615

One Round circular pale orange object rising almost vertically to the South,then over us heading North.;2011-11-26 20:45:00;10 mins;One Round circular pale orange object rising almost vertically to the South, then over us heading North. My friend and I happened to be out in the backyard when he remarked and pointed out dimly lit round object in the sky to the South.  What was peculiar was it's flight patternas it was ascending nearly vertically at first,then headed towards, then almost directly over us, on a Northerly course,which we viewed through binoculars.  Upon getting a closer view we both concurred that the object was round, a pale orange/yellowish color and no regular aircraft running lights appeared. We are both fairly skeptical middle aged men,sober and have aircraft experience ,possesing analytical and perceptive observational abilities.  We both concurred that what we saw had to be a UFO.  Regrettably no pictures were taken,but we both know what we observed an hour ago was not any kind of plane or type of aircraft either one of us have ever seen.;34.4301388888889;-119.718623202615
