Silent Triangle craft sighted Venice, CA May 3rd 2011 21:20;2011-05-03 21:20:00;15 seconds;Silent Triangle craft sighted Venice, CA May 3rd 2011 21:20 I went out to walk my dog at about 9:20PM on May 3, 2011.   As I walked southwest down the alley behind my house I noticed movement in the sky and I looked up, at first I thought it was a hang glider.  Approximately 150 feet up above the rooftops flying southeast I watched it for ten seconds before it flew beyond my field of view.    The craft had no loss of altitude, and made no sound whatsoever.   The craft was totally silent, with no lights.  Appeared to be a dark blue or black chevron shape, like the top of a triangle with no base, with yellow painted circles under each wing.   I could not discern any texture to the bottom as it flew by it was seemingly flat and smooth.   I also did not see anything on top of the craft - there were no ducts that I could see at the back of the craft for propulsion.  Conditions were a cloudless sky and it was a new moon! night.  Estimate the size of the craft to be 30 feet across the base of the triangle, fairly equilateral i! n terms of proportions.;33.9955;-118.4644
