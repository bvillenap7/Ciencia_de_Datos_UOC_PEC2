Two light orbs with propulsion flares on bottom  flying above Venice,CA;2005-11-24 00:00:00;20 min.;Two light orbs with propulsion flares on bottom  flying above Venice,CA That morning I arrived at the desntist office at 8:00 am. The doors were not open yet and people where starting to arrive. It was a very clear day so I noticed the moon in full view,then I noticed a ball of light on the right side of the moon.I pointed it out to everyone and then we noticed it moving very slow and very very high. We did not think much about it untill I looked up again before we started in the office and wow! there were two now but directly over us moving up very high then down low.I filmed this because I just happened to have my camera to bring to take pics of my friends new store in the area. This was Lincoln blvd and Rose Ave. in Venice,CA. I downloaded the footage on my computer and blew them up. They looked like balls of light with a force from underneath. I had to stop and go in for my apt. When I came out they were gone.;33.9955;-118.4644
It was like a star was bouncing around inside our world.;2008-04-18 22:00:00;30 seconds;It was like a star was bouncing around inside our world. Much smaller than a real star of course., But amazing! My wife and I where in bed watching television, and then suddenly we both saw what seemed to be a bright shooting star outside of our window. We both thought that it was a little to bright to be a meteorite and zip that fast through the sky like that, so we both said at the same time Did you see that!?? We both got up out of bed and looked out the window and saw this perfectly round bright dot in the sky that seemed pretty far away. It looked just like a star, but was not flickering like a star usually does. We just focused on the what we though was to be a star for a short while before it suddenly started bouncing around in the sky at a speed that I have never seen before. I am 100% positive and sure that it was something that was from out of this world! At first my heart was racing and we were both startled trying to figure out what we both just saw. Then later we picked each others JAWS up from the ground, shook our heads in disbelief and calmed down. We both talked about it for a whie and still can't get it off of our minds.;33.9955;-118.4644

Covered a great distance in less than two minutes I walked out the to beach at approximately 10:45 pm last night and sitting on the beach looking at the blackness. After about 15 minutes, there was a light that came from the south horizon, near South Marina, hovering over the water moving faster than anything I have seen. The light stayed steady, it did not bob up and down like a boat would and it moved as fast an airplane.  It covered the distance of the full horizon from the Marina all the way to Malibu in just about two minutes possibly less. It was somewhat close to shore, made no sound at all and moved faster than any boat possible.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen.
