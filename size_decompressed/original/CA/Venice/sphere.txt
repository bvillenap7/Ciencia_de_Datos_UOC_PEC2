I was on the lawn with my daughter and was lying down and looking up.  I saw a very small dot that flashed. It was so high it could not be a plane.  We both saw it flash a couple more times then disappeared.  It was hard to see being so very high.  The flashing seemed to be it catching the the sunlight and reflecting it.  It moved slowly across the sky.;33.9955;-118.4644
