They  seemed to be on a dimmer as they were hard to see -yet they had an essence of being reflectors instead of bulbs emitting light  --- no engine sound but a very slight whishing. Each light seemed to be about the size of a dime at arms length. Altitude was around 3500 ft. The entire sighting could have been no more than 6 seconds to cross the sky as much as I could see from my yard. I live in Venice 5 blocks from the beach --- as there are lots of city lights about my viewing is somewhat limited.  In November around the same time of evening I saw the same formation only a full V --- 11 lights total ---- as they crossed the sky and before losing sight of them the light at the apex seemed to move to the right leg of the V --- I thought it was a flock of geese and dismissed it as wishful UFO sighting --- however, each light  was about the size of a dime at arms length. I would estimate the altitude to be around 3500 ft.  The most curious thing was that I knew earlier today that I should go out tonight and that I would see the lights again. Around 6:15pm I bundled up and joined the cats on the trampoline for observation. Seeing only 1/2 of what I had seen before was a little disappointing but it flew in the exact same spot and at the same speed with the same silent whishing - like a big bird passing overhead.  I have spent many evenings in my yard looking at the sky and lots of air traffic. My father was a pilot and I have extensive knowledge of military, commercial, and private aircraft --- and many years of attending air shows in the LA area.;33.9955;-118.4644
