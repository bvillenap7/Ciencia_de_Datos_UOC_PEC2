Speed was slower than most planes from Santa Monica airport. Looked like the vehicles were white or metalic/see through reflecting light from city.  Very smooth flight.  NO noise at all, which would never happen. I own DJI drones and observes planes all day from LAX and Santa Monica airport, but this was NOT the case.  No sound and flight looked Delta formation and could have been changing shapes to thinner as it picked up speed to leave the area into the black over ocean. This happened between the first 1-2am before daylight savings time. The sky was clearest in months after a MASSIVE electrical storm the night before.;33.9955;-118.4644
