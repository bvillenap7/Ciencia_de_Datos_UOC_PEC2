Venice Beach 2 Long Jetstreams..  ((NUFORC Note:  Photo shows contrails behind a twin-engine airliner.  PD));2010-08-23 19:35:00;~5 min.;Venice Beach 2 Long Jetstreams.. I went to see the sunset/full moonrise last night, 8/23/10, and right after the sun set, I saw what looked to be a rocket launching vertically through the sky with 2 long jetstreams following behind it. It was difficult to zoom into the craft itself with my camera, but the jetstreams are very apparent. The craft was launching into the sky north of where I was seated on the beach, perhaps near the canyons. I also filmed a video to show how quickly it was rising. I contacted Vandenberg AFB and they said they did not launch anything that day and will not until September. ((NUFORC Note:  Photo shows contrails behind a twin-engine airliner.
