I got halfway down the street, approaching the intersection of Rose and 3rd Avenues, when I noticed what appeared to be a very large swarm of agitated black balloons.  At first I thought someone must have released the balloons for a festival, or perhaps the balloons were released by some cruise ship out at sea.  I struggled to make sense of what I was looking at. The entire cluster seemed to be visibly composed of 8-12 large individual black spheres, all rapidly moving around each other. They were swirling and leapfrogging as though an animated cartoon. The words nightmarish and cartoon-like come to mind.  Each sphere seemed blacker than black - mere silhouettes.  When I realized I was observing something incredibly out of the ordinary, I hit the brakes, shifted into reverse, and back tracked into my driveway. I then went into my apartment to grab my camcorder, stepped outside, and started taping.  This entire process took about 4 minutes.  In 4 minutes, this cluster, size difficult to determine - appeared to be as large as a car or perhaps house, managed to travel from above the intersection to the clouds you see in the clips.

We have looked at the footage, and conclude that the cluster may, in fact, be a group of balloons, which are tethered to one another.  PD));33.9955;-118.4644
