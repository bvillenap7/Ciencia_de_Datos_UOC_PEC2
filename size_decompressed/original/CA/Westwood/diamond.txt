Second sighting by my son and I within the past week or so. This was simular if not the same craft as seen on 12/28/07 only from the side and from a distance of between 1 to 3 miles away and either at a lower elevation or extreemly huge and not so high. This time it was moving from s/w to n/e and was silent and traveling fast. I and my son watched as it continued for what seemed like an extremely long time, which made me realize just how huge it was by how long it apperaed in my view between the mts. miles away.
