3 bright shiney luminecent like objects houvering in the horizon over san diego 1985.;1985-08-15 13:00:00;10 to15 min;3 bright shiney luminecent like objects houvering in the horizon over san diego 1985. It was mid summer around 1:00 to 3:00 pm from what I can remember, my sister and mother and I were just getting out of our car and we all seemed to stop silently without a word to and we were frozen in our footsteps, we were looking out over the horizon towards the ocean, ramona where we were is high elavation and you can see the ocean on a clear day, but we all stood for what seemed to be a long time and watched as three bright, very bright lights, seen clearly even in the summer sun, houvering and moving together in a triangular position and just as we were able to speak,after the shock, the objects vanished. I know this is from 1985 but I have no doubt that what we saw was a ufo. I feel that having the paople who you are closest to you've known all your life to share in such an unbelievable experience,one we will never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Ling string of lights heading south east that appear in orbit. Various brightness for each of the lights. ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 05:20:00;2 minutes;Ling string of lights heading south east that appear in orbit. Various brightness for each of the lights. Moving at a steady pace like a satellite. Checked SpaceX site for location of there satellites space link. They should not have been in the area. Looked like them though.;33.0313;-116.8579
This string of lights was moving faster than a jet aircraft would at what appeared to be a comparable altitude.;2021-02-18 05:00:00;90 seconds;At approximately 5:20 on the morning of 02/19/2021, from San Diego Country Estates in Ramona, California, I observed a long “string of lights” moving west to east over San Diego County. I originally had thought they were stars, as they had similar intensity of light as stars in the early morning sky. Then I noticed their uniform horizontal movement as a group, staying equidistant from each other.  This string of lights was moving faster than a jet aircraft would at what appeared to be a comparable altitude. The string consisted of 20 - 30 lights that remained horizontally in line with each other and moved in complete silence. The movement of the row of lights appeared as though they were attached to each other by a single string.  The wind was coming from the east and the lights were moving west. There was no noise at all and the lights were white with a similar intensity of brightness as the surrounding stars. They were too low to have been a satellite.;33.0313;-116.8579
