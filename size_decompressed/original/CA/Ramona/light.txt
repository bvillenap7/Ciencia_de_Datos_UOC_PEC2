It was a greenish glowing object which moved at unimaginable great speed.;1979-06-30 21:00:00;aprox. 2-3 min.;It was a greenish glowing object which moved at unimaginable great speed. MY UFO SIGHTING REPORT   While driving a   neighbors’ dog home my older sister and I caught an unusual light from the corner of our eye.  I say this because it moved so quickly that you could not keep sight of where it was going.  I was only 9 yrs. old but I remember every detail as though it was yesterday.  This is something you don’t forget. After a minute we saw it again.  I’ve never seen anything make maneuvers like this did.  It moved horizontally and vertically. While the object was still visible our headlights began to dim and the radio went completely static.  The size of it I’ll describe as best as I can.  If you hold out your thumb up in front of you it is the approximate size of the object. The color was a light blue-green kind of glow. Anyhow the object seemed as though it noticed us for a few seconds then it took of so quickly straight upward in the sky.  Then the static disappeared from the radio. I know what I saw was not of anything man made.  I wet my pants. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.  PD));33.0313;-116.8579
A small light flew across the sky pretty slowly. It wasnt a plane there were no flashing lights.;1999-04-12 08:30:00;1 minute;A small light flew across the sky pretty slowly. It wasnt a plane there were no flashing lights. A small light flew across the sky on an actual flight path but it diped up and down to fast to be a plane of any kind. Then my stereo turned off and on about 6 times. The object flew out of site and everything returned to normal.;33.0313;-116.8579
Bright lights seen in  Ramona mountains, California;2000-01-05 21:00:00;2 minutes;Bright lights seen in  Ramona mountains, California Night sky, high cumulous clouds, in a rural farming area, 360 degree view of surrounding mountains. We have a nearby small airport with lots of traffic during the day.. No other craft in the sky at this moment. Two brilliant lights, traveling parallel to one another, about a mile east of the farm, just under the cloud level, occasionally passing through them, one a mile east, the other about 5 miles away, farther east, both traveling due North. Both lights/craft were absolutely silent, with no blinking or wavering lights additional...just a steady, brilliant glow. Appeared to cover horizon to horizon in about 2 minutes. Background sounds were several coyotes barking and light breeze.;33.0313;-116.8579
Large light in the sky in San Diego County, the light turned off while I was watching it and did not reappearwas not a planet.;2008-05-16 04:30:00;20 Seconds;Large light in the sky in San Diego County, the light turned off while I was watching it and did not reappearwas not a planet. My friends and I were on our way to Cuyamaca Rancho State park to go hiking early in the morning before our classes began, as we drove through a barren stretch of highway in the rural areas of San Diego County, I looked out the front window at what I believed to be a planet. The object was not twinkling which made me believe it was perhaps a planet, the object was extremely bright for an astronomical object and the light was of a white/blue color. While I looked at the object, trying to discern what it could be, the light was extinguished, It seemed to me as if some kind of object had come in front of the light, obscuring it. Though it occurred quickly, it seemed as if a dark circular  object roughly the same size as the light moved over it, causing the light to be unseen. The night was very clear and cloudless, I looked in the location the light had been and nothing in the air was present that could have blocked it out. Over the next half hour,  looked in the same location hoping that it was merely a cloud that passed by abd that the object would return  to being visible. The object did not return, there was nothing in the air that could have obscured any astronomical  object. I believe there was something flying within our atmosphere that deliberately extinguished this light.;33.0313;-116.8579
I heard a pulsating sound, thought, That's a weird sounding helicopter.  Looked up and saw a jet following a light.;2015-07-29 20:27:00;1 minute;I heard a pulsating sound, thought &quotthat's a weird sounding helicopter looked up and saw a jet following a light.  I heard a pulsating sound, thought that's a weird sounding helicopter looked up and saw a jet following a light.   Since I have a good idea how big fighter jets are, the light was between 5 feet across they flew directly from Poway to the Ramona airport should have gone right along the north end of highway 69 Ramonas Main st.   About 1000 feet in altitude as slow as the jet could fly.;33.0313;-116.8579
Glowing blue orb over Ramona, CA.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;>1 hour;Glowing blue orb over Ramona, CA On the night of Nov 7th, my 2 sons and a friend of theirs walked out our house to the back yard, and when they did, they shouted Oh my god, what is that thing!? I ran outside to see what was going on, and in the sky over us was a large glowing blue orb thing, with a huge circle of haze around it. The blue was an intense, ultra blue. And it was night, so the sky was black.  As we watched, the orb lights seemed to be moving VERY slowly, which I guess was an indication of it being pretty high in the atmosphere. The part of the scene we saw slowly dissipated until we couldn't make it out anymore, and the circle of haze around it disappeared.  Our friend called her grandmother who lives on the outskirts of Ramona to see if she witnessed the event, and her grandmother said yes she had been watching it for a while. She said before we saw the orb thing, she had seen some type of explosion out of the light, and she said she thinks the blue orb and haze were a result of the explosion. And the full event was over an hour.  While we were outside, I heard our neighbors all around us freaking out over the orb and they were taking pictures too. And my kids also saw a green line on the orb, but I couldn't see this with my poorer eyesight. I did capture a bit of the event on my cell phone, but it's hard to see because it was dark and the object was not extremely bright. You can see a bit though, and hear not only us, but our neighbors talking about it too. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));33.0313;-116.8579
