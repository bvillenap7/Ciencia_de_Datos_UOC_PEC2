I went outside to have a smoke, as my mother and father are not smokers. After a short while I saw a beam of light coming down from the sky. The beam was only about 75 to 100 yards from where I was smoking. It seemed as if the light was searching for something moving here and there, up the hill and then down the hill. At first, I thought it might have been a helicopter searching for something, but I didn’t hear the sound of the blades cutting through the air. The sky was very dark blue and the stars were out, but when I tried to see where the light was coming from I couldn’t see a thing. I thought at least I would see a silhouette of the thing from where the light came. I called to my nephew, who was about 9 or 10 years old at the time, to come outside.  He yelled back that he was watching something on television. A few minutes later the light went out. This was the strangest experience I ever had and remember it forever. Every time I hear the word ‘UFO,’ or ‘alien,’ I always think of this strange moment in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.0313;-116.8579
10 red and white lights moving erratically across Ramona skyline;2007-07-11 22:00:00;25 minutes;10 red and white lights moving erratically across Ramona skyline I walked outside of my home this evening and yelled back to my mother who was still in the house to come see how clear the sky was. Once my mom was outside she said do you see that? I said, see what? Those lights over there. I looked up and just North East of our home we saw about 10 lights red and white in color blinking very slowly, getting dim then bright again.  I said those are planes and yuo re being ridiculous. It was tehn I realized there was no way planes could possibly fly that close together.  All of a sudden about 6 lights darted away from each other and were moving erratically across the sky, then they would allrace back twards each other. This went on for about 25 minutes.   I still am not positive what they were, but I won't rule ut UFO's.;33.0313;-116.8579
