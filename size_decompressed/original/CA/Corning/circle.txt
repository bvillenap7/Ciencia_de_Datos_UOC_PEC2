It was round and silver-white in color with a bit of dark on the bottom.  A military type jet flew over traveling in the same direction, then a minute later another jet going in the same direction flew by.  About 4 minutes later one of the jets flew back in the southerly direction and disappeard in a large cloud.  We feel that the jet was looking for the UFO. Addendum:  The original statement sent to you earlier today stated that we had seen one craft at approximately 15:40 hours in the sky above our house, which traveled north at a slow rate of speed. There was no sound. And a slight rotation of the object. It disappeared into the clouds.  About 20 minutes later another, or perhaps the same craft, appeared in the sky to the east of our home. It too was the same shape, but this one performed a acrobatic manuever, before it too disappeared into the clouds.  We DO have video tape of both events.  If you can send a snail-mail address, we can send you a copy of the video.  Also, exactly 6 months ago today on October 3, 2000, at approximately the same time of day as the previous event, we video taped another craft over our home. The same discription of the object was seen.;39.9283;-122.201
