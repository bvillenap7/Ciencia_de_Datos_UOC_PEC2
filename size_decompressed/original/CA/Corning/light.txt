Three bright lights seen in many Californai towns;2003-01-25 18:00:00;about 3 hours;Three bright lights seen in many Californai towns I saw the three lights from many different towns in the Californi valley, the witnesses included me, siblings, parents, and grandparents.  We saw them at first around 6:00PM and they were three circular lights that flew in circles, the two dimmer ones followed the brighter one and they were going pretty fast.  They went in the same path untill around 9:30 when the two brightest ones dissapeared. The dimmest one kept going for about ten more minutes befor dissapearing.  We know they wern't planes or anything like that becuase we went to different towns to make sure and they were always there and we were to far away for them to be search lights.;39.9283;-122.201
