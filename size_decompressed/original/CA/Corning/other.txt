Unitentified object reported in northern California.;2011-04-08 03:00:00;4 sec;Unitentified object reported in northern California. I am a maintenance worker at a local casino I work from 12am to 8:30 am.  I was finishing putting away some equipment when the sighting occurred.  In a brief window above the casino the object was moving from south to north.  The object consisted of three circles in a triangle formation rotating counter clockwise.  It only took around 4 seconds and my boss was to far behind me to get him out there to see it because it was over so quickly.
