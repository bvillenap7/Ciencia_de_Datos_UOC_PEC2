The object moved slowly from a great distance, then appeared to change course due south. Several seconds later, it emitted what I can describe as small colored tear drop shaped orbs (2 or 3) straight to the earth, it repeated this process twice more, about 10 to 15 seconds apart then disappeared.  The path of the object seemed to be manulipated. It first appeared about 30 degrees above the horizon and slowly dropped elevation a few degrees, it was a cloudy nights with only a handful of visible stars high overhead.;40.5835;-124.1473
