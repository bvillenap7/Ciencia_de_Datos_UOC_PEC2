After watching it for an half an hour it began to move slowly down to a point above the Van Duzen river then followed it to the junction of the Eel River.  It then proceeded down the Eel river to just past Fernbridge where it fired off three long translucent bolts reminding one of the O in morse code.  When it came closer approx 1000 ft or so above the river-bed it was HUGE. In passing, it lit up the entire vally.  It also had a force field around it, that was clear excpt for the edge of it which appeared very bright.  We could see the stars through the force-field.   Calling the police and fire Dept.'s, the lines were busy till 430 a.m. ... no wat in. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sightng may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Bright, low flying orange craft drops several orange orbs before vanishing.;2008-03-15 23:00:00;5 Min;Bright, low flying orange craft drops several orange orbs before vanishing. While walking on a clear night near a large park, I looked to my left and saw a big orange ball of light heading my direction. It was coming towards me completely silent about the same height that a private plane would fly.  As I stopped to watch, it came and hovered over me. In complete shock, I put my arm up to shield my eyes from the light to get a better look, but couldn't see anything. After hovering over me, it quietly resumed flight. After a few seconds, it stopped again (this time some distance away) and dropped two smaller orange orbs from it's bottom. Both orbs disappeared before hitting the ground. The craft then suddenly moved away quietly as I ran down the sloped street I was on.   When I got to the bottom, I looked back, only to see that the craft was gone.
