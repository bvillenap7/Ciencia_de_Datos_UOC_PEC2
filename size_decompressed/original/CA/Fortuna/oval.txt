Bright orange oval object, located over Hwy. 101, Fortuna, California;2000-11-03 22:35:00;30 minutes;Bright orange oval object, located over Hwy. 101, Fortuna, California Object located over Hwy. 101 near Main Street Exit, northbound traffic lanes. Object was oval in shape, bright orange with no other lights noted, no sound or noise heard. Object was stationary in the sky, estimated altitude 750 ft. Observed object for approximately 30 minutes, then I had to leave the area (was on my way to work in Eureka) This object has been seen before--first sighting January 17th, 1998, and has been observed by myself on 2 other occasions, with the last sighting February, 2000. On this occasion, the object was not seen to emit sparkly objects from the bottom of the 'craft' however, this phenomena has been observed on 2 other occasions. ((NUFORC Note:  Because of recent UFO reports from California, we requested additional information.  Our request, and the subsequent response, are below:   Dear ((name deleted)), Thank you very much for the report!  I am interested to know who the other witnesses were.  Would they like to submit reports, as well?  Did they leave the scene at the same time you did? Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport  -- Peter B.

Traffic was light and some of the other cars were slowing to look...2 vehicles stopped. One was in the southbound lane, and  one was just behind me. This was a man and a woman (I  think), he asked me What the hell is it? Good  question. As I stated, I have seen this object before,  it appears to be the same thing each time with no color  variation except when it drops the sparkly-looking stuff  from the bottom. I can supply the names of witnesses to  the Jan, 17th 1998 (first) sighting which occured at  02:30 this sighting was the most dramatic and clear of  them all so far. Something weird is going on up here...  please: any ideas of what??????;40.5835;-124.1473
