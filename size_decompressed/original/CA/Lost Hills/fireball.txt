Blue streak that split into two, seen over 5 freeway in Kern County;2008-01-27 17:45:00;15 seconds;Blue streak that split into two, seen over 5 freeway in Kern County We were in our vehicle going south on Interstate 5 through Kern County at approximately 5:30pm-6:00pm. Were not sure about the exact location, but it was somewhere between Kettleman City and Buttonwillow. The sky was pitch black and stars were visible. My wife and I both saw a glowing fireball of light in the sky moving from east to west. The fireball was very bright with a blue tinge. It appeared to be low in the sky moving in a perfectly horizontal streak. The instant we saw it we thought it might be a shooting star, but then it continued to last for about 15-20 seconds. The light did not dim or arc as a shooting star typically does. It continued horizontally and then split into two bright lights. Next, the two lights immediately moved in opposite directions and disappeared. We were shocked because it looked nothing like a shooting star and it was definitely not an airplane.;35.6144;-119.6971
