I was spending afternoon in San Marino, near Pasadena when I noticed an unusual shape flying in the sky.  A few us took notice.  The object was very high.  A small aircraft passed near it which gave me the impression the object may have been 30 feet wide.  It rotated and would reflect off the sun every rotation.  One end was mirrored or metallic and the other was darker.  I couldn't quite make out the shape so I took several photos hoping that would answer questions. Unfortunately because of the height most people, once they didn't know what it was went on with their day.;34.1253;-118.1112
