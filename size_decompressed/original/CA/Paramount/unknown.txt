Falling star slows ..stops... Lights up sky.. And takes off..  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;5 minutes;Falling star slows ..stops... Lights up sky.. And takes off.. A light looking like a falling star slowed down..  Then began to drop melting material from its tail stream..  As it slowed it then stopped...  And the melting stopped..  It sat in the sky for a brief minute..  Just looking like a regular light in the sky..  Then it got extremely bright. And lit up the night sky..  And with unseen speed just took off into outer space..  Leaving behind the brightest after burn effect and a blue substance in the sky for minutes after it was gone...
