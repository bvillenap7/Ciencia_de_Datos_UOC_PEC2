UFO sighting near Paramount, California;2020-03-15 20:00:00;3 minutes;UFO sighting near Paramount, California On 3/15/20 at 8pm PST I was going to my neighbors to let her know dinner was ready, when I noticed a reddish/orange light to the east of me that looked like it was on fire.  The object was approximately 30 degrees up in the sky from my angle.  I was with my neighbor and pointed it out to her.  At first we thought it was a plane that was on fire and crashing and then the fire appeared to stop.  The object was still very bright but had a darker circular center area.  Then again it appeared to be back on fire with flames shooting high in the sky above it and it started moving very irratically, up/down, forward/backwards and diagonally. We then realized that this was very unusual.  We tried to film it with my neighbor's iPhone but it would not show up on her camara but it was clearly visible by eye.  This lasted for about 3 minutes and then the object left eastward at an extremely high rate of speed and went from looking like a blimp on fire to a pin point in less than a second and disappeared and was over.;33.8959000000001;-118.1649
