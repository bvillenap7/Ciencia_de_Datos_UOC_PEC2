Holding out hand, size was thumb nail, above cirrus clouds did not dissapate but disappeared immediately. I was traveling northbound on I 5 and in a late afternoon sky I saw a circle or disk shaped object that was a greenish silver and was irredescence in color.  The streak lasted some 1/2 second and by holding out hand it was about the size of my thumb nail.  I noticed it was above the thin layer of cirrus clouds. It was too big to be a shooting star.  The sky was still blue and the sun was still in the sky.  I was amazed by how bright the object was inthe daytime sky.  It was moving faster than anythng I had seen before including shooting stars.  The object came from behind me out of the southeast and traveled toward the northeast.  Without dissapating, the object just disapeared.  No jerking movment or obvious change of direction was observed.  I couldn't tell if it had a tail of if I was observing the visual stretch of the object due to the speed.  I don't think this was space junk because of the size of the solid part of the object.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168

While observing a low cloud that was splitting and evaporating, I saw an unexplained object in the sky.  Looking up from approx a 45 deg angle from my truck, I saw a round object at a very, very high altitude.  It was by chance I saw this it was directly right of the cloud formation I was looking at and was quite high I doubt I would have seen while even looking up at birds.  At first I tried to reason that it was a high flying aircraft or a maybe a passing satellite.  But after a very brief arch like movement in the sky, I viewed this object in one spot for at least 20-25 minutes.   After a few minutes I grabbed my Carson binoculars out of my truck to get a better view which made a bit of a difference.  It was just motionless in the air (jumping around in my binoculars since you cant keep your hands perfectly still) and then I saw a blue, what appeared to be arrow-tipped shaped object rotate around the original round object that I was viewing.  After about 10 minutes the arrow seemed to be gone and the object seemed to emit a red and white (alternating) light. This could have been the sun/light anomaly but I was observing the lights in timed intervals.  I was looking at this for another 10 minutes.  For a third time I took the binoculars away to see where the object was in relation to the tree in front of me, but this time when I looked up I couldn’t locate it again.  I started to view this at appox. 3:40 pm PST on 08APR06.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168

Very large UFO chased away with fighter jets numerous times;2016-01-14 06:30:00;6 hours;Very Large UFO chased away with fighter jets numerous times UFO Sighted in Southern California (Santa Clarita)  On the early morning of Thursday, January 14th 2016 around the time of 0630 I was unwinding watching TV on the couch I just finished working my usual night shift. Now to quickly paint a picture our house sits high up on the side of a small mountain the back of our house faces east (facing the Los Angeles National Forest Mountain Line). While watching TV I noticed a large object hovering still over the top of one of the mounts in the LA National Forest, the morning sky was just starting to light up with the sun rising in the east behind the object, but the sun hadn’t peaked over the mountain just yet.  The object caught my attention since it was the only object in the sky at first I thought this was only a cloud, however there wasn’t any other clouds in the sky.  I took a couple photos and then sat back down on the couch continuing watching TV but still keeping an eye out the window when all of a sudden 5 or 10 minutes later the image moved a bit and had looked like it broke up showing other objects hovering below and to the sides of the larger object that’s when I confirmed to myself its only a cloud since it had broke up a bit..  But then what happened next is when I realized it’s a UFO.., the object came together as one again and started to leave it moved east away from where I was. After the UFO left I noticed the morning sky filled with more then a dozen fighter jets. About 1 hour later around 0730 the object repapered the UFO was cloaked and appeared as a large cloud next there were 2 fighter jets which flew over our house and headed east toward the UFO.. as the jets approached, the UFO started to leave and head east away from the incoming jets pursuing it in the distance I noticed what looked like the first jet to plummet down (as if the jet was shoot down or it pursued a drone or something).  The scale of how large the UFO was enormous, in the pictures you can tell that the size of the jets in comparison were tiny, this UFO dwarfed our jets, this was their mother ship as it's referred to or a floating city. One hour later the object reappeared and headed west toward our house and then north and dropped down behind the mountain ridge.  In the distance you could see jets flying all around in that direction.  Further I saw another plan flying overhead, this was a radar plan, the plan with the large circle dome on the top of it. There was a lot of activity over the Los Angeles National forest this morning I called the news station and the LA National Ranger Station, but no one followed back up with me. ((NUFORC Note:  The object in the photo seems to us to be a cloud.  PD));34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168
