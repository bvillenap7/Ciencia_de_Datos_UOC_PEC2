Very large, slow moving boomerang/flying wing craft with blinking red lights;2005-06-13 21:15:00;1 minute;Very large, slow moving boomerang/flying wing craft with blinking red lights It was about 9:15pm, and several of us were drying off after swimming in a neighbor's backyard pool.  My wife pointed out an object flying in the sky above us, and about 7 of us saw it (four adults and three children).  The object was a boomerang/flying wing shape, and it was very large, larger than any craft that I have seen or am familiar with.  It was flying slowly across the sky approximately south, and it had a unique engine sounds, similar to powerful jet engines, but quieter.  The body was dark and barely visible, and it had small blinking red lights across the length of the craft (approximately 7 or 8 lights).  The lights appeared to blink without a pattern, which seemed kind of strange, and they did not resemble the lights normally seen on the commercial aircraft that fly over regularly.  There was (what appeared to be) a fighter aircraft that flew by a bit west and somewhat behind the craft.  We assumed that it was an escort, as it did not appear to be in pursuit, although it was clearly following/staying close.  It would occasionally bank and maneuver.  Strangely, about 10 minutes later, another similar craft flew over going in the same direction.  This one was further away from us, but it also appeared to be smaller.  It had similar lights and appeared to have a similar body shape, although it was difficult to tell.  It also emitted the same jetlike sounds. A few minutes later, a fighter aircraft flew back in the opposite direction and then banked east and flew off.  We are in a flight path of Burbank Airport, but there were no other commercial jets flying over at the time.  We are also about 50 miles from Edwards Air Force Base.  The crafts appeared terrestrial (as opposed to the object I reported in November of 2003 over Valencia, CA, which was extremely out of the ordinary).  I am an executive for a major financial services company, and I had considered myself to be more or less skeptical until 2003.  I feel strange reporting something for a second time, since I had not seen anything unusual through my entire life until then.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168
