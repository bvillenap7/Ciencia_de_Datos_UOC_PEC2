A yellow/orange  fireball/orb like object  hovering then dissapearing about 20 stories high of the ground in Santa Clarita, California.;2012-12-25 19:00:00;3 minutes;A yellow/orange  fireball/orb like object  hovering then dissapearing about 20 stories high of the ground in Santa Clarita, California. My husband is a nurse at a hospital and I am a stay at home mom to our one son.   On Christmas day we drove to my grandparents house to have a Christmas dinner with my side of the family.   As my husband was taking our son out of the car, I noticed a orange/yellowish fire ball/orb like object moving extremely slow in a horizontal direction going right, then it suddenly stopped and it was just hovering there for about a minute, not moving or making any sound at all it was completely silent.   It was a really quiet night in a really quiet neighborhood, so we would have been able to hear if it was a plane or a helicopter.   When my husband finally got our son out of the car, I showed him the orb.   We stood and watched it.. it was about 20 stories high of the ground...way to low for a helicopter or plane.  It appeared to be on fire..or glowing.   Then suddenly it just went up and to the right in a diagonal motion extremely fast and after about 10 seconds we could not see! it anymore.   It definitely made that Christmas a memorable one.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168

A tail on one end, and a ball at the other (like a flash).  Appeared only seconds, and then disappeared.  At 6:37 a.m., I saw a greenish/blue object in the sky.  It had a tail (for lack of a better word) and a ball at the end.  It flashed for only seconds.   What the heck was it.  It basically looked like what a meteor looks like, but was greenish/blue.
