Small white and bright ball over Santa Clarita skies;2003-02-09 15:00:00;15 min;Small white and bright ball over Santa Clarita skies Sunday we went to fix the antennas of our repeater (we are Ham radio operators)at Contractors Point and in the way down I saw a small white ball comming to our direction.Suddenly the object stoped or reduced the speed and was floting in the sky for at least 15 minutes.We stoped the car and my friend tried to take a picture with his digital camera but the object suddenly disappeared.My friend was taken pictures before of his daughter and also he took me a picture fixing our antennas. When he uploaded the pictures in his computer he detected a small white ball in two pictures.Those pictures were taken 3 hours before I saw the object the first time.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168
Bright red lights hoovering over Santa Clarita;2004-12-12 17:00:00;30minutes;Bright red lights hoovering over Santa Clarita I was walking my dogs when I noticed a bright red light. Round shape. The light was travelling from west to east at a slow pace. The light stopped travelling east at some point just north of the Santa Clarita Valley. As it hovered it lost altitude and began to hover at about 2,500 ft. It would  move from left to right in a very slow manner and then make 90 degree turns upward and gain altitude. I watched it for the better part of 30 minutes. There were many witnesses at Costco, both customers and employees. The object did not make any sound and had no visible means of propulsion.  The object began to travel away from me in a westerly direction at a very shallow angle, again with no visible means of propulsion. It climbed and travelled at relatively the same speed. Never increasing speed. There were times as I watched that the object would bounce up and down and side to side as if being affected by turbulence. The most amazing thing, as I continued to watch this, is I realized the object left the earths atmosphere when the red object began to twinkle.  I continued to watch it until it was no longer visible to the naked eye.  I am very familiar with the aviation, and I am not aware of any aircraft that behave in that manner.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168
Strange flying light visiting the same area in Southern California multiple times.;2012-08-29 20:30:00;40 minutes;Strange flying light visiting the same area in Southern California multiple times. A strange flying object has appeared over the Santa Clarita Ca. Area for the last month.  I personally have seen the object 3 times (twice this week).  The object changes colors (green, red and white) and it flies at different altitudes. I uploaded an iPhone video to YouTube  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV8vb0VKXb0;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168
