Last night my Father (a retired Lockheed employee and WW2 Army/Airforce Vet)was setting in a lawn chair in my backyard when he said to me,Do you have Fireflys around here? I told him no And saw he was looking into the southern part of the sky. I then walked over to him and looked into the sky and asked him what he saw. He said he saw a streak of light in the sky that looked like a Firefly. I then looked in the direction he was looking and suddenly I saw a quick, Bright streak of light that was very thin moving from West to East. I said that looks like a meteor. about 30 seconds later, another streak of light was in the exact area but this time it went from east to west. I was then kind of freaked out to see the same thing, in the exact area but going the opposite direction. At that time my Mother, my Brother and his Girlfriend walked over to see what we were looking at when the same streak of light appeared again, This time going from North to south in the same exact area. We were all wondering what we were seeing. I attempted to explain it as a meteor shower but we all agreed it would not be in the exact same area in the sky. About 1 minute passed when we then saw a bright strobe type flash in the sky Just south and lower in the horizon from where we saw the steaks of light. about 5 seconds later, another flash of light appeared futher south and even lower in the horizon. We continued to look into the sky for several more minutes when we once again saw the bright flash of light, This time is was towards the east of the other light flashes. It was now we all realized that this was no meteor shower so I ran in to get the Video Camera. Unfotunately we never saw the objects again. I can only describe the steaks of light as Pencil thin,White Streaks with no contrails. They only went a distance of your hand streached out in the sky. All 4 steaks of light (3 which I saw)were within an area of the sky where as if you were to hold out both hands and make a circle with your thumbs and pinky fingers. The l! ight str eaks appeared to be way up in the atmosphere and traveled at least 5 times faster than any meteor or falling star that I have ever seen. The 3 bright flashes we saw resembled an Aircraft Stobe light but about 3 times brighter. At about 2030hrs I telephoned the nearest Air Force Base (Edwards AFB)which is about 70 miles away. I spoke to a person at their command post who said he had no idea what I saw and that no information about any flight testing or Military operations could be given out. He then gave me the phone number to the UFO reporting center. I then called the reporting center and spoke with Mr. Davenport and told him about the incident. He said that what I saw was very unusual and was not from This earth. What my family and I saw last night was definately the most unusual thing we have ever saw. We believe the Sightings were of alien nature but we are not really sure. My wife was in the house during the time of the incident and now she thinks im crazy. All I can say is that I saw what I saw and I'm not Crazy. I am a Deputy Sheriff in the Southern California area and have seen strange things before, but not like this! ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC Director talked with the witness at some length, and found him to be a seemingly very good observer and reporter of fact.  His description of the event was very precise, and he had made a note of the exact time of the event.   If we led the individual to believe that we concluded the phenomenon was UFO-related, we misspoke, and apologize.  We have no idea what caused this phenomenon.

Color Changing Light Over Sant Clarita Valley;2012-09-08 20:45:00;10 minutes;Color Changing Light Over Sant Clarita Valley My mother and I were driving home on the freeway when I noticed a very bright green light that appeared to be floating about 1,000-1,500 feet above the wash next to the freeway.  The movement pattern of the light was akin to the way a balloon moves through the air, floating with mild changes in altitude.  The light then changed from green to bright violet blue at which point it became markedly brighter and appeared to grow in size by about 50 percent.  It then shrunk back to it’s normal size then changed colors again to red and then to white and back to green.  The whole time the light was moving away from us and we lost sight of it as we exited to freeway.   However as we turned of the main road down our street we saw the light which had changed back to violet blue over the trees.  As we went down the hill to our house we lost sight of the light and did not see it again even though we went back up to the main road to see if it could be seen from there.  My ! mother and I had both independently witnessed similar lights on separate occasions during the week or so proceeding this sighting.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168

Direction wise, these homes were located along the 14 freeway Northbound going towards Palmdale, Antelope Valley.    These houses were on hills and from the distance it looked as if they were floating low.  All I know is that these lights were a faded green color.    As soon as I registered what I was seeing, the lights slowly faded away and they were gone.   Mind you, today's been extremely windy, so the sky looked especially crystal clear.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168

Suddenly, to the southeast we saw a bright white light float upwards into the clouds and then it disappeared!  Then a second time it appeared and went upwards and disappeared again. This craft was not flying like a normal aircraft.  The white light was brighter than any light on any aircraft I had ever seen!  We did not see it again.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168
White ball of light traveling across the night sky.;2019-10-24 01:00:00;2:00;White ball of light traveling across the night sky. At about 1:00 AM Pacific standard time I looked South out my patio door and saw what appeared to be a white light approaching in the distance. Appeared at first to be the light from a helicopter coming towards me however it appeared to turn west and began to accelerate towards the Pacific Ocean at a 45 degree angle and continued at a decent speed until no longer visible, like if it continued at that angle it would go into orbit. I thought it must have been a rocket launch but it was just a ball of white light.  There were no flashing lights like a jet or some other type of aircraft and no sound. It did not have exhaust like I’ve seen before on a rocket launch but when it turned and accelerated the light seemed to trail slightly behind it like a teardrop till it was too small to see anymore. I wish I grabbed my phone but I knew I wouldn’t get it in time. It really bothered me because I couldn’t explain it. Couldn’t find any reports of a rocket launch either f! or that evening. Never seen anything like it before.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168
