This object was in a cigar shape or vertical craft.  Because it was dark, the actually craft could not been seen, but there were a number of red lights that give off the apparent shape.  There were two large lights at the base, one on top of the other that did not blink at all but just were on.  Then two separate red lights would stream from the top red light upward, kind of like a kid's toy laser gun would have the red lights stream from one end to the other when the trigger was hit.  Now this object was huge. From my backyard I watch planes and helicopters fly by as I relax in my hot tub at night.  If a plane would be a spec in the sky about a half an inch big, this thing was 50 times that size.  Because it was a full moon last night, I did notice that it left a stream, or line in the sky, same as what a fighter plane would leave.  Shortly after the object disappeared over the mountain, a small craft came chasing after it.  This craft was a straight red light, not blinking like most planes do and it was fast.  No noise.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168
