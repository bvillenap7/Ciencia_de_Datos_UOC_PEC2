Moved slowy from North West to South East over Walmart Parking lot in Canyon Country. Witnessed a slow moving object, triangular in shape with red lights on the corners. The object moved slowly from North West to South East and passed over the parking lot of the WalMart Store that myself and my family were exiting. It moved slowly and made no sound.  At the time there was a slight cloud cover and the object appeared to be a good deal bellow it.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168
Triangle ufo over Santa Clarita. Possible man made!;2009-10-28 21:30:00;1 min;Triangle ufo over Santa Clarita. Possible man made! I was outside last nite having a cigarette when I heard a large low flying plane and noticed a large army plane which was not unusual since Edwards Air Force base is not to far away.  But after looking at the plane I notice that out in front of the plane by about 500ft was another craft with no blinking lights just a faint light in each corver, Red, Blue, Green.  I immedietly called my wife who was able to see the craft as well.  It seamed that the plane was following the craft so I dont know if this may be a man made ufo or if they were observing it.;34.4253760036489;-118.513900821168
