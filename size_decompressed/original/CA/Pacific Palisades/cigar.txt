HUGE METALLIC BLIMP-CIGAR SHAPED CRAFT PARKED ABOVE PACIFIC PALISADES.  ((anonymous report));2019-02-16 14:45:00;40 minutes;HUGE METALLIC BLIMP-CIGAR SHAPED CRAFT PARKED ABOVE PACIFIC PALISADES Going down PCH from west Malibu a huge cigar/blimp shaped crafted was seen by many looking towards Santa Monica above Pacific Palisades.  It was parked around 250ft above ground in the sky as if it was fixated.  It must have been there for a good while because driving from West Malibu to Santa Monica took around 30-40 minutes.  This was close to the Sunset Blvd and PCH intersection.  While driving you could see the underbelly of it and it looked to be dark charcoal gray and top part was metallic gray.  It was simply parked completely still in place.  Definitely not the goodyear blimp.  This must have been witnessed by hundreds as it was so obvious.
