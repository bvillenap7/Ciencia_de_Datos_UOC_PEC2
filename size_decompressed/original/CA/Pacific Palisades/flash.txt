A bright flash like lightning followed by a fast moving very bright object like a comet;2008-06-14 22:45:00;3 to 4 sec.;A bright flash like lightning followed by a fast moving very bright object like a comet Me and my date witnessed a flash that appeared to be lightning , then 1 or 2 seconds later a bright light crossed overhead at high speed(similar to what would be a shooting star but seemed much brighter)and disappeared behind some mountains. What made this really unusual was the flash prior to seeing the bright object. We were both sitting in my house at the time and observed this through my large floor to ceiling windows.  I am really curious to know if others witnessed it as well, since it was so obvious. My house is situated near the ocean between Santa Monica and Malibu California.;34.0501999999998;-118.529699999999
