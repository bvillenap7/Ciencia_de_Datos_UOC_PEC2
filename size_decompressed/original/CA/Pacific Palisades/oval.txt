Sitting on my deck facing north, to my right I witnessed first a smaller oval-ish deep orange orb flying at first from north to south and then erratically starting a decent yet almost hoovering at that time a larger likeness orb appeared higher in the sky as the other was dissenting. I noticed this because they were not flying in the normal flight patterns for the planes landing at the local airports (LAX & Santa Monica). I was dumbfounded and at the same time my brain was telling me to take a photo, call my daughter, get binoculars, etc. The best I could do was run out to the front of the house as quickly as I could to see if the orbs I had lost behind a tree would still be thereâ€¦.they were gone!;34.0501999999998;-118.529699999999
