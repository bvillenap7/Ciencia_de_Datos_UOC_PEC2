Multiple blinking lights under of Pacific Ocean.  ((anonymous report));2016-10-20 19:00:00;0:00;multiple blinking lights under of pacific ocean I was passing by the cliffs that overlook the Pacific where I usually pause for a view. I noticed several strobe lights and a small boat close to shore and at first thought it was a fishing vessel. I have lived here for over 50 years and never seen a fishing boat so close to shore.  I watched the lights for some time expecting to see some sort of circular or semicircular formation that would suggest net but the pattern was all over the place. I drove into Santa Monica and looked from the bluffs there but they couldnâ€™t be seen. Driving along the coast, they were also out of site.  When I stopped, again at the first place I had noticed them it was still going on. It sounds more like a test of some sort, point Magu military base is not far off but I am unable to find any indication they were there.  Maybe you can pass it along or make sense of it.
