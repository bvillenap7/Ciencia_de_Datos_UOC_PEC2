Cigar shaped object with 3 bright round white lights;2001-11-16 13:30:00;10 - 15 seconds;Cigar shaped object with 3 bright round white lights Driving west bound on the 101 freeway in North Hollywood. I saw a cigar shaped object in the western sky about 60 degrees. 3 bright round white lights shaped like this, --0--0--0--.  At first I thought it was an airplane because it's around the Burbank airport area and I see lots of airplanes around this way. Object would be about 2 inches across at arms length. What struck me funny was the 3 white big round lights. I've never seen them look that way on an airplane and thought I had an unusual perspective. I expected to see the plane turn and have a different view, however, I had to avert my eyes and when I looked up again a few seconds later the object was gone. It was a mostly clear day, a few clouds further off in the distance and at a much greater altitude.  I observed a plane coming east bound several minutes later with no lights on. (This is the second of two unsimilar objects seen while driving LA area freeways this week, and I also reported the other. This is the first time I have ever seen anything unusual, let alone two in one week).;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
