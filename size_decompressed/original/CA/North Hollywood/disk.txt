It glowed a very bright dark red and stayed absolutely stationery for about 30 minutes. All of a sudden, it moved directly north with a dipping motion, it allso was very easily seen to be revolving as it through off the red dark haze that surrounded it. It picked up speed, still in a dipping arc, and took off like a shot. The spot where it had been had what looked like a star(low altitude!!!!) which diminished over a minute or so. The ship was absolutely breathtaking,beautiful.Next day, we told all in our midst, met with the usual 'yeah, sure' till 4pm when a co-worker arrived with a loud 'you should have seen what my son and I saw last night!!!!!!!!!!!!';34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
