North Hollywood:13061 Vanowen St. Second Floor apartment bedroom window facing southward. Church and unobscured clear weather view of the sky in direct path. Got up to change channel on TV and was drwn towards the window by bright orange glowing objects outside and to the south behind the church. Six Objects in formation. One other that was much lower and cruising appoximately one hundred feet above the power lines. They came over the apartments where I was living and I could see them quite clearly from the center courtyard second floor catwalk. They (6) stopped in mid flight just when passing to my direct west and abruptly changed direction from due north to west. I'd say that they were each about the size of a quarter at arms length away from the body. The rogue ship that was lower never did come up above the horizon from where I was watching this. At this point a neighbor was awakened by what he thought was an explosion and came outside to where I was standing with another person to watch the sighting. I did not hear any noise from the objects during the ten minutes that they were in my complete view. As they ascended at 45 degrees azimuth they seemed to be shooting sparks out from the rear and I could see small silvery disks being ejected from the object that were not illuminated except from the orange glow of the UFO. They quickly were lost sight of after they descended into the darkness. At this time three other presons were returning home from a late night poker game and immediately came up the catwalk to see what was going on. This was approximately 8 minutes after they were first spotted by myself. The next day I talked to another of my neighbors who also witnessed it but was too frightened to come outside and watch it with us. After nine minutes of observation the two objects to the right and left of the center object blinked out. The remaining two objects sped off at a fantastic rate of speed. I could still see them for only a few more seconds before they were out of my vision range.  After the sighting was over we called the local radio station (KGIL) to report the sighting. The overnight board operator said that he received one other report from someone in Van Nuys, CA. The next morning, we called the local US Air Force to report the sighting. the officer told us, We do not know what they are. Also, I observed a LAPD patrol car going down Vanowen St. at Ethel Avenue to the West. I not sure if he saw it too. But, I think that it would have been very visible to anyone that managed to be outside and looking up. I managed to somehow snap a single photo from a Kodak instamatic 126 camera of a single object. It was not very impressive! But, I still have the negative available. Unfortunately, I didn't remember taking the photograph until four years later! So, It was in the early 70's that we finally had it developed.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055

My husband and I were watching Dallas on tv when my son came home.  When he came in he saidhey mom, what's that above our house?We went out to the backyard and right above our house was 4 balls of light rotating simutaneously at a very fast speed. My son and I stayed in the backyard for about one hour to see if they would go away or change positions ,but they didn't. we decided to go in when our dog started to howl and cry at the balls of light.  we also took the dog in the house ,but he kept on crying until they disappeared at about 3:00 am in the morning.

there was a glowin sphere which is still visible right now that is still swayin back and forth in the distance;2007-03-11 04:25:00;2 1/2hrs;there was a glowin sphere which is still visible right now that is still swayin back and forth in the distance basically from the point of view from where my dad, g/f who i called to see it for herself aswell as i. we could all see it in the direcetion of van nuys to reseda. as for her, she was watchin it from sun valley in the same direction. my dad coming from work reported seeing it before but tonight just as he came in brought me outside...it was roughly around 3 when i first saw it and it was a small orange glow that moved slowy from side to side.. then it swayed pretty fast at the distance i was lookin at which outta my guess would be, i think, 15-20 miles out or even further but it moved about still swayin. it is still being seen by my dad at this moment and since i had my telescope here aswell, i tried to see it while my dad had his binoculars. through the binoculars you could see an orange glowin sphere with the bottom being slightly glowin more as if it was a crescent moon with it smilin at the bottom of it. but as i tried with the telescope, the object was harder to spot because it had almost no focus. i thought it would be a projection of light until i saw a plane fly behind it at, i think 4am. but i was able to see it's glow and to my interest continuly spotted a small star lookin object to the right underside of it which stayed following the glow. eventually i gave up on the telescope cuz i couldn't get a good site but with the binoculars i saw it as a orange sphere still glowin and for as fast as it swayed with the distance also, i was certain that it couldn't be a plane or balloon for there was no wind and for how far it was it moved as quick as you would see a balloon move that was 4 ft away after being slighty tapped. it is 4 39 right now at it is still visible seemin slightly smaller but it's diameter is still a bit bigger than this ---->OO;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
6-21-08 Spherical UFO in North Hollywood CA;2008-06-21 20:00:00;90 seconds;6-21-08 Spherical UFO in North Hollywood CA Witnessed a spherical object that was a bronze/metallic in color and had a light that seemed to rotate as it was moving through the sky.   It was far away and was dusk, and at first I thought it was a balloon but its measured slow movement in a straight line across the evening sky made me feel it was something else, and my girlfriend after asked  if that was a balloon, said, No thatâ€™s not a balloon. It was clear to us that it was a UFO, and possibly some sort of advanced technology.   We did not feel scared or anything but it was a peculiar object in the night sky, and something I have never witnessed in all my years. This occurred in  North Hollywood, CA 91606 at approximately 8:00 pm in the evening, just a little south of Victory Blvd..  It was spotted moving from west to east  moving from over Bellaire ave. toward Whitsett  ave..  Possibly above Erwin street. A map is below and would e interested if others saw this event.  http://maps.google.com/maps?q=north+hollywood,+ca+91606&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&resnum=1&ct=title;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
