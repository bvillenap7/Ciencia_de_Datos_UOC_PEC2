I saw a set of green constant airplane lights coming toward me and the Burbank, Airport landing path that I reside underneath.  This was an unusual color pattern and direction so I mentioned it to the man I was talking to.  As the green lights came closer, traveling on a straight line North East towards the South West the 'plane' appeared to be gaining altitude and just as my friend noted that it appeared to be increasing speed when... suddenly it just stopped. It did not slow down nor turn, Just stopped and reversed direction as if it were a film running backwards.  It was NOT spectacular but the green light pattern and the flight path were clearly unusual before we saw it stop motion and change direction.  The lights continued to look the same from the new angle as it moved away. It appeared to be lower in the sky than space. Like an airplane.  Definitely not a helicopter and more than likely too big and fast to have been a drone of any kind.  I am still in awe of the fact it just stopped in mid air.  I had a clear view.  It was almost overhead when it reversed and then returned across the horizon and disappeared from my view behind some buildings.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
