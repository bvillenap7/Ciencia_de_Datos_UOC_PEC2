On January 31, 2009 I was driving a car and heading west on Magnolia Blvd. near Irvine Ave. at about 10:15 PM  Something came front right over me and streaked straight down across the sky in front of me and disappeared past the horizon. My windows were open, but I heard no sound. I know the woman in the car next to me saw it too, but we did not communicate with each other. It was clearly capsule-shaped, (or rectangular with rounded edges) never blurred or faded, but seemed to be glowing from above. It was light bluish-green (more on the green side) and seemed like it was not too far up. It did not seem like it was in space. It looked clear or crisp like it was just over the valley. It was much faster than a plane, but not as fast as a shooting star or meteor, at least none that I have seen before. I was so sure that it was a close object that I was expecting a big crash or explosion or something after I couldn't see it anymore. I have been looking on the news and online, but nobody has said anything.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
