I witnessed a UFO dogfight.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a serious report.  PD));2005-01-01 00:00:00;21 minutes;I witnessed a UFO dogfight. I was coming back home from church after New Year's Service. I was on the S-101 Freeway. My car was the only vehicle on the freeway at the time. Suddenly, mr car stopped. I stepped out and looked around to see if anyone could give me a jumpstart. Suddenly, I heard weird pinging sounds. I looked up and saw three saucers zipping through. There were green trails where the aircrafts had flown by. They were in a tight triangular formation. Suddenly, four or five more saucers in loose formation shot out from the clouds after the previous UFOs (which I think they were). Suddenly, a light shot out from one of the pursuiting crafts after the ones that had previously zipped by. It hit one, and it instantly blew up. When the green phosphorous light caused by what I think was a missile cleared, there was no more light there. From the rear, more missiles shot out. One of the lead UFOs took a sharp banking turn (the light started dimming, which I think means he turned away) and the missile just continued on its path. The other one took a critical hit, and the same thing happened. There was nothing else. The four or five planes in the back seemed to have disappeared because it didn't glow anymore, but later, I saw flashing lights, which I think were indicator lights. Therefore, I concluded that only the first three planes were UFOs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

However, having only glanced through the January reports, I read TWO that were obviously hoaxes: (1/15/05) Las Vegas, and the dancing disco balls!, plus (1/1/05) North Hollywood writer states he/she witnessed a UFO dogfight!  Come on!  Please screen you emails a little better.  You have an AMAZING website, and your standards are usually top notch.  Thank you for the hard work.

Red blinking lights over Los Angeles, Thurs. Feb 14th, 2013.;2013-02-14 23:17:00;2:00;Red blinking lights over Los Angeles, Thurs. Feb 14th, 2013. The craft was moving in a southern direction from Burbank airport across North Hollywood over the Hollywood Hills.  There were two red lights that were blinking in unison, and one was higher than the other.  The two lights were locked in position as the flew and never changed their proximity to one another.  There was no sound and a random traffic/police helicopter flew under it at a different course at one point.

Glinting formation, multiple objects.;2020-02-15 12:30:00;15 minutes;Glinting formation, multiple objects There were about 15 glinting objects that were floating through the sky,  I couldnâ€™t see their shape exactly, but they moved almost like balloons, except they seemed to have more control over where they were going.  They were very high up in the sky and went south east.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
