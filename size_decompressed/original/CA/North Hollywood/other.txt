Immediate reaction. Meditative and Contemplative day.  Various Religious rites earlier. Looked up to see two very bright lights, Jupiter is very prominent right now and they had that kind of shine. Upon my conscious attention tuning into them one light fizzled out, the other flew straight off into the horizon at about 50 degrees  serious speed until it was out of sight.  Then noticed clouds were unusual, rather lively.  Something of weight was there.  A perfect square was cut out in the clouds.  Thoughts of the Mahabharata, and cloud camouflage, then a pyramid.  Potentially another in the distance or mind was running off.  May have been a merkabah.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
