white, blue, & green in the Valley;2003-12-15 22:45:00;2 SEC;white, blue, & green in the Valley As my boyfriend & i were walking east out of a video rental store, i turned to my right to face him as i talked to him & we both saw a comet/firebal shaped flash of horizontal light heading west. It was enormous in size, huge white/blue/green color  ball at what appeared to be the front, w/a white tail behind....kind of looked like this  <   ) i don't know the length of time it was in the sky before we saw it, but we saw it for about 2 seconds, shooting straight horizontal towards the west, extremely fast. It disappeared so quickly, wouldn't say disintegrated because it was so big. To have dinintegrated, we would have probably seen it break down a lot more than just disappearing. It looked really close as well. My boyfriend said his dad told him that sometimes satellites that fall into the atmosphere burn up, & people confuse them w/ufos...

I first saw it at about 10 degrees to the right above my head and I watched it fall directly in front of my line of sight as I walked down the street.  My head was facing about 25 degrees to the west of the north star.   It apeared to disintigrate at about tree top level, there was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object was a meteor, but that is only a guess.  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and he seemed to be a very good witness to us to be quite credible.

Large green ball of light dropping from sky over North Hollywood/Burbank California.;2006-09-03 01:30:00;1 second;Large green ball of light dropping from sky over North Hollywood/Burbank California. I was driving home from Burbank to North Hollywood when I noticed a large green ball of light drop from the sky overlooking Burbank airport.  I thought about what I had just seen and decided to call North Hollywood Police Department to make a report.  They recommended I reach Burbank Airport/Bob Hope Airport Police department.  They, in turn, gave me your contact info.  I already left a msg with the voicemail, but, a move was mentioned so I decided to try the website as well.  Thank you for being around in this random event.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
