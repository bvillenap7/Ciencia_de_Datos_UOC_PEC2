Diamond-ish rotating yellow and blue object slowly traveling NW over San Fernando valley.;2016-06-11 18:25:00;17 minutes;Diamond-ish rotating yellow and blue object slowly traveling NW over San Fernando valley While watching birds with binoculars, I noticed an object that at first appeared to be floating like a balloon but wasn't following the wind.  It had distinct yellow and light blue colors at times which was noticeable because it was a cloudy day with occasional showers. Very gray.   It easily could have been a glider, but that airspace is very restricted over Burbank.  It started as a diamond shape but appeared to rotate.  It almost looked like something was tethered to it at certain angles.  It slowly moved Northwest just before two black military helicopters showed up traveling westward.  Which makes me think I'm not the only one who was aware of it because I'm familiar with the air traffic in this area and those choppers are rarely seen.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055

PD));2018-02-10 16:00:00;20 minutes;2/10/2015 16:00 local Glittering diamond silver in color I was watching an airplane fly over.  I noted a glittering object high up that was stationary.   The object was glittering with silver colored sparkles.  The object after ten minutes began to slowly move.  Then was stationary.   I went inside and got my client to also witness.  She also saw the object.  I used my cell phone to video and get stills.  I will have to process them. By the time I was able to borrow binoculars from my client to get a better look, the object had vanished. I am a commercially rated pilot and certified flight instructor/instrument, also hold airframe and power plant mechanic certificate.  Bachelor and Master degrees from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University.  I teach  aircraft mechanics. Very sure was not a mylar balloon.  I have seen those before' they do not glitter like this. Wind was calm.  A mylar balloon at this altitude would not survive. Local weather at kvny.
