On Saturday June 23, 2007 Between 8:00 and 9:00 P.M. I was viewing the moon with my telescope when I seen an round object crossing the moon's light going east. The object had no visible strobe or any other permanent lights. I seen a total five round objects that night,but not all at the same time. They were several minuets apart. One round object went west across the moon. The objects were a dark silhouette against the moon's light. That night the moon was approximately 45 degrees up from the horizon. I was at that time facing south.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
Bright Orange Light Moving Silently, Low In The Sky;2014-12-24 03:35:00;45 seconds;Bright Orange Light Moving Silently, Low In The Sky I happened to look out of my kitchen window, and saw a large, very bright orange light, low in the sky, moving west to east.  I immediately knew I was seeing something odd.  So I ran outside to get a better look.  It was an extremely bright light (orange in the center, and light orange and white on the very edge).  There was no sound, and although it wasn't actually pulsating, the brightness of the object was very intense, so if it actually was a craft I couldn't ascertain that.  It was moving relatively slowly and then made a slow/smooth move to the south.  I lost sight of it when my view was blocked by some trees.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
White orb on fire.;2015-11-07 18:05:00;2:00 minutes;White orb on fire. It looked like a giant shooting star, and then like it lit on fire.  It then turned the sky white and left a green streak in the sky behind it.   It eventually burnt out and the looked like a faint white orb that was possibly smoking.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
Facing SE from 2nd floor apt.  Facing Studio City/Burbank.  Glowing turquoise circular light.;2016-01-14 03:15:00;10 seconds;Facing SE from 2nd floor apt.  Facing Studio City/Burbank.  Glowing turquoise circular light. If I was holding up a dime it would have bl Facing SE from 2nd floor apt. Facing Studio City/Burbank. Glowing turquoise circular light.  If I was holding up a dime it would have blocked it. Caught my eye out open front door.  Guessing 10 stories high, as close as above the 2 story building across the street/night sky (3:15 am) facing Hollywood Hills backdrop/perception of height and distance might be off due to mountainous backdrop. Mimicked a stationary hummingbird's quick back and forth movement.  Felt slightly nervous/excited, forced my eyes away take photo, eyes back on light instead, duration 3 more seconds/light quickly dissolved, no trail, smoke, color change, no noise, no movement. Don't believe I confused this sighting with the various antenna on the hills.  I've lived in this unit 10 years familiar with the lights on horizon.  I am also a sky watcher. Perhaps a telephone transmitter (my second thought), however, my fixation on the light was enough to contact NUFORC.
