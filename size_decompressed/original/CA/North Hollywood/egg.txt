This happened directly over the MTA North Hollywood Station located at Lankershim and Chandler in the San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles. The object was at approximately 3,000 AGL altitude. This is not a prank report. There was also an LAPD helicopter and an two airliners directly over head at the same time as well, not related obviously. Interesting to note just in case, one of the airliners tyoe craft was way higher in altitude compared to other high flying airliner type jets. Also, the UAP craft seemed to either be blinking a bright white light or moving in a manner that reflected sun light to make to it appear that way from the ground.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
