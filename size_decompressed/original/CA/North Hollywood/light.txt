Large bright red light hovers high in atmosphere then rockets away at unreal speed.;2003-08-26 23:25:00;5 min;Large bright red light hovers high in atmosphere then rockets away at unreal speed. A extremely bright large round red light was observed in the southern sky, not too far from the position of planet Mars.  The light was stationary and appeared very high in the sky.  I had a sense this was higher than aircraft go.  It stood still for several minutes and was brighter than anything I have ever seen in the night sky.  Then suddenly it accelerated at an unbelievable speed, as fast as a shooting star across the sky, and vanished in the night sky.  There was no trail of light.  A faint light remained in the spot as the main light disappeared.  My friend and I have never seen anything like this before and we do not know what it was.  We only know that it was like nothing we have ever observed and it seem unreal and unnatural.  I'm glad someone else saw it with me to confirm my reality.

Lighted Possible Triangular Silent Object Passed By My Complex;2009-05-10 20:20:00;5 minutes;Lighted Possible Triangular Silent Object Passed By My Complex Hey if anyone is in southern Ca, NE of N. Hollywood... I just had a very quiet pass by our complex! It was headed NE from here looked like it was going at a smooth clip but didn't seem too fast because it just glided through the air (my opinion) but I imagine it must have been going very fast. <--- Ok that sounds contradictory... what I mean to say is that it must have been going fast because it was going about as fast as one of theses LAPD choppers when they are cruising by but silent and I guess because of the lack of noise, it just seemed to glide by effortlessly which in my head made it seem like it was just strolling by. Sorry i really suck at explaining this... Bright white light... no blinking just solid Didn't have time to grab a camera but i did have binoculars nearby, through them, god help me I'm gonna say it... it looked triangular but that could be just what was exposed by the light. From what i could tell it seemed like the size of a Helicopter but in no way did it make me think it was one... just a size reference! The light on it was bigger than an LAPD chopper spotlight and it wasn't emitting a beam or anything, at least in my opinion... I see enough LAPD choppers at night to know the difference. Unless he was running with no lights but that one and somehow made his chopper completely silent. Made no noise whatsoever... I even started talking to it, saying hold on, come closer, sounds corny but I really wanted to communicate. God, I'm shaking I'm so excited... this was about 20 minutes ago 8:20 pm PST  Ok, so right after I typed this I heard some LAPD choppers over in the NE direction for awhile and then I heard them pass by my complex heading to what sounded to be in the SE direction. I also noted that the whole time this was going on, including while I was typing this post my cell phone kept turning off and rebooting itself over and over again and stopped after I heard the LAPD go by. Could be the phone though... I hate my blackberry. It couldn't have been LAPD or any other helicopter only due to the fact it seemed to be very close and made no noise at all. I wish it had stopped for awhile;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
Bright White light, hovering still 30 mins, Then moving away slowly, over NW Los Angeles Co..  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));2010-07-15 21:00:00;30 minutes;Bright White light, hovering still 30 mins..  Then moving away slowly, over NW Los Angeles County In the 9 pm hour noticed a particularly bright white light in western sky.  It was strange because it was a hazy night, and no stars or planets were visible, as it was not a clear enough evening.  Not only was this visible, but it was exceptionally bright. The object was stationary, and high in the sky.  I showed my wife who also thought it was strange, because no stars could be seen, but this could.  I decided to stand on my porch with binoculars and look closer. It was difficult to make out any discernible shape, because the white light was too bright.  But it was just sitting still in the sky.  No aviation lights blinking of any kind.  No detectable movement.  It was definitely not a helicopter, or plane.  I watched commercial planes fly by it, and sometimes under it, on their approach to LAX and Burbank airports. I mad sure not to move my position on my porch, so that I could keep the lights position in perspective against the visual landmarks I was comparing its position too.  It remained still, lined up in the same spot and  not moving. I judged this by relating it's position to a palm tree, and telephone lines in my line of view. It was hard to judge how far away it was, because I don't know how big it was.  It definitely wasn't close by.  I would guess hovering somewhere between Woodland Hills and Malibu, CA, both due west of my location. After about 30 mins I was ready to give up, having decided it simply must be a very bright viewing of Venus or something, when it suddenly (albeit slowly) started moving to the north and further away (out towards the ocean, maybe near Thousand Oaks, CA). I watched closely, and had my wife join me.  She had been checking it's location from time to time, during the half hour.  She completely agreed that it had moved significantly off the spot it had hovered, completely still in, and was moving away. I felt that it also seemed less bright, and possibly even a slightly orange hue, during its exiting the area. Eventually it was out of our view.  Too far gone. We have no explanation.

Bright flashing red light moving south in sky;2011-12-26 19:35:00;2 min;bright flashing red light moving south in sky stepped out for a cigerette and looked up to see if i could see the star Betelgeus and noticed a bright flashing red light moving south.  There was no sound. I  watched for a few min or so, then it stopped moving, staying still in the southern part of the sky for about 30 seconeds, then just disappeared. I know this wasn't a plane or a helicopter as i live in the take off area for flights leaving the burbank airport and can hear and see those as they pass on takeoff.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055
