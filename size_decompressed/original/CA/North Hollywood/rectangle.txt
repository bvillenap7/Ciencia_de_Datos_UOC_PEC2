Silvery and very distinct  tail lights super fast;2012-11-04 13:00:00;2 minutes;Silvery and very distinct  tail lights super fast I was the passenger of my boyfriend's car, we were going east on Magnolia Blvd. Less then half a block before we turn, I was looking up and barely above this two story apartment building, I noticed this rectangular shaped silvery moving object. It looked like the back end with two small red tail lights and a exhaust pipe. It was almost like something out of Star Wars.  I started kind of yelling oh look at that to my boyfriend but, he couldn't of course because he was driving.  Turning right on to Riverton Ave.  I was still looking up at the sky and noticed that the object had ascended 150 ft. high, but I could still see the silvery object.;34.1736797535212;-118.380437676055

HUGE Stationary object sitting in the same place in the sky for a month over LA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible planet??  Anonymous.  PD));2018-09-11 22:44:00;1 month;HUGE Stationary object sitting in the same place in the sky for a month over Los Angeles Been seeing a huge light in the western sky over Los Angeles for weeks.  Too big to be a planet, and does not orbit like planets, stars, the ISS.  Seems to be long and rectangular shaped three quarters of it is gold colored, one quarter is red colored.   Tonight it is situated more to the south, the first time I have seen it in a different place since I noticed it a month ago.  Neighbor got out his binoculars but says he couldnâ€™t make out what it is.  It makes me feel nervous.  It sits stationary in the sky except for tonight in a different location, but still not moving.  What is it!!!
