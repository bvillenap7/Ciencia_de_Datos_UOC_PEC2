Silent  Close Range White Light seen on Highway 280 south of Highway 92. Witnessed by 3.;1996-10-15 00:45:00;10 Minutes;Silent  Close Range White Light seen on Highway 280 south of Highway 92. Witnessed by 3. When this first happened years ago - I told my mother, and we together made an online report to a UFO newsgroup. I was interviewed shortly thereafter by three people in the group, but do not recall if it was MUFON or other - so I'm posting this again, in hopes that someone knows something.  I was a Freshman in college driving South on I280 at 12:45am, after visiting my girlfriend in Pacifica. There were few other cars on the highway, but I had been next to roughly 3 vehicles since entering the highway. The night was very clear, no fog, I do not remember seeing the moon or recall if there was a lot of moonlight. It was a warm evening, for I had the sunroof open on my VW Jetta. I had just gone under the Highway 92 overcrossing and was between (2) Vista Points headed towards the Edgewood Rd Exit. I recall squinting my eyes for a bright light was shining through my back window. I reached up flipped the mirror to night mode and assumed nothing. The light passed under the over crossing and continued to bare down on my car and the two next to me. I slowed down and moved over to the slow lane, for I thought it was a police officer with his spot light on. We came around a slow curve to the right and the light had closed to within a 1/8th of a mile of traffic. At that point I realized that it was just too high above the road to be a car, but perhaps a tall truck. I couldn't make out any shape to it, just an intense white light. It continued to close distance and by this point I could tell that it was not connected to the ground for its movement was smooth and frictionless. The light didn't jiggle like that of a car when it goes over bumps. I recall looking at the driver in the car to the left of me and getting a quizical look back from him, I motioned with my shoulders an I Don't know expression... When the light was a couple hundred yards behind us, it was clear it was at approximately 50' off the ground, but I couldn't not make out any sound over my car and the wind noise from the open sunroof. Once again I made an assumption and figured it was a police helicopter with a spot light, or perhaps a small Cesna. My mom and uncle are private pilots and I have a lot of experience around small aircraft. The white light certainly could have been a landing gear light, but I did not see any blinkin! g colored lights to depict a plane. The light then sped up and passed directly over the my car, and the two other vehicles near me. SILENTLY. I could make out a slight dull figure contained within the orb of light, but cannot faithfully say what shape it was. After passing us the light continued off in front of us for roughly another mile, when it made a HARD angular ascent at roughly a 65 degree angle and sped out of site. Shocked, myself and the guy in the car next to me pulled over to the side of the freeway and talked about the thing. Neither of us could explain, or hypothesize what it was. Creeped out by the dark and lack of other cars on the road we left the scene. I exited at Edgewood Rd, and headed to my house on Crestview Dr in San Carlos. I told my Mom about what I saw and retrieved my police scanner. We sat outside on the back deck watching the western sky for hours, too wired to sleep. We heard little on the scanner of reference, but did hear a call for a CHP officer to investigate a bright light seen at a Vista Point, which are supposed to be closed at dusk. I hope this report helps or provides a link to someone else's experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.5544911564625;-122.310303061225

Strange light orb over lake.;2013-03-30 00:13:00;1 minute;strange light orb over lake I was walking my dog, like i do every night while listening to music.  I live next to a lake which is quite dark and deserted around the late evening.  As i was walking my dog along the water i noticed a large light in the distance but ignored it thinking that it was a helicopter with the spotlight on, possibly looking for a criminal and i also saw what appared to be a plane chasing or observing its actions.  As i continued walking, i noticed clouds moving in fairly quickly around the sky but wasnt bothered by it because it was coming in fast but not too abnormally fast.  There was also one rather large dark cloud that began to cloak the moon so it became eclipsed, but you could still see a glow around the cloud.  i found this strange because when i began my walk, there were only a few clouds but soon began to look like a light fog or mist.  As i got towards the end of the trail next to the lake, my dog decided to urinate on a plant as he normally does. Usually wh! en my dog has to stop, i take my time to enjoy my music and stare at the sky and the stars. As my dog urinated, i looked up at the sky and saw the light again but this time it wasnt as far into the distance as before, but still relatively far away.  I stared at the light and tried to determine what it was, and noticed it had a spherical shape with a glow around it.  The light made a slow and small left to right motion and hovered there and then bolted past the trees and dissapeared, i am not sure if the object emitted noise because i was listening to music but a couple seconds before i noticed the light, my phone lost reception but this only lasted a few seconds then returned to normal still before i had noticed the light. This could not have been a comet because the sky was cloaked with clouds at this point and you could barely see the moons glow past the dark clouds and this light was bright and too large to be a comet. I also thought it could be a missile, because of the ! recent threats made by north korea but a missile could not hav! e made t hat left to right motion and just hover. This could not have been a plane or helicopter because of the speed it was traveling as it left, it was going at the rate of shooting star possibly even faster. Prior to leaving my house, i heard rain outside my window for about less than 5 minutes, as well as 2 or 3 car alarms going off but am not sure if it ties into the sighting. after seeing this light, i ran home out of fear and panic along with my dog. Im scared, because i don't know what i saw tonight and feel slightly traumatized because it is the strangest thing i've seen in my whole life.;37.5544911564625;-122.310303061225
