Schools kids witness UFO;1970-01-22 10:00:00;30 Seconds;Schools kids witness UFO Around 1970 I was attending Bayside Middle School in San Mateo, California.  I don't recall what time of year it was, but because of the weather I believe it was either early Fall or early Spring.  It was a clear crisp morning with blue skies and no clouds. I was with a small group of students, about a dozen of us, and Mr. Ford the Physical Education coach doing calisthenics near the swimming pool.  We were waiting our turn to run laps, when we were all suddenly mesmerized by the sight of a UFO.  No one said a word as we viewed this object for about 30 seconds before it disappeared. The UFO was spherical in shape. It was a bright silver metallic color.  The sun was reflecting off it's surface as it rotated in a revolving motion.  Similar to a planet rotating on it's axis.  It appeared to be about 200 feet above the ground and 150 yards from where we were at.  It made no sound, and hovered in one position until it disappeared. The most memorable thing about this sighting was how the UFO disappeared. Almost as in slow motion, it looked like the sky opened up and the UFO slipped in to it.  The best way I can describe what this looked like is if you were to lay a coin on top of a piece of paper.  Cut a small slit in the paper the size of the coin.  Then slide the coin through the slit, so you can no longer see it. That's how this UFO appeared to disappear. After the sighting, Mr. Ford was in shock and disbelief.  He told us not to say a word or tell anyone about what we saw. I never understood his reason why.   Years later I tried to contact him.  Unfortunately he never returned my message. As a side note. At that time I was a newspaper delivery boy for the San Mateo Times, and recall reading a newspaper article about UFO sightings near Coyote Point in San Mateo.  I have tried finding the article at the local library, but without success.  Bayside Middle School and Coyote Point are both on the San Francisco bay just south of San Francisco International Airport.;37.5544911564625;-122.310303061225
A spherical craft shot into the air from a large patch of intensely bright light.;2001-12-03 19:00:00;5 minutes;A spherical craft shot into the air from a large patch of intensely bright light. This occurred while driving south on highway 101. My fiancee and I noticed a large patch of light (approximately the size of 4 football fields) west of us (likely in the ocean). This light like a very bright day in the middle of a dark night. This lasted 5-6 seconds and then a spherical craft shot into the air with a bright white and yellow tail. It had a diameter of approximately 200-300 feet. It's tail turned red and then yellow and it continued straight up until it was indistinguishable from a star. This process took about 5 minutes.  This is the first time either of us have seen anything like this. I grew up in the U.S. and am a physician. My fiancee is from southeast asian and works in the IT field.;37.5544911564625;-122.310303061225
