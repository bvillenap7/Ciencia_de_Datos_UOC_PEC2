2 bright streaks of light with dark object above them observed in clear, cloudless sky.;2006-05-17 20:25:00;5-7 minutes;2 bright streaks of light with dark object above them observed in clear, cloudless sky. We were driving Highway 101 northbound, from Redwood City towards San Mateo, nearing the time of sunset, approx 8:25pm.  It was a very clear, cloudless sky.  I noticed what initially appeared to be two, parallel streaks of bright light, slightly angled to the left of what would have been a vertical position.  When I first noticed the streaks, they appeared to be moving downward.  This only lasted a second or two, and then the streaks appeared stationary. I said to my husband (who was driving) Look at that...what do you think that is?  Neither he nor I could come up with an explanation of what it could be.  It was an interesting phenomena, because we both were expecting as we drove closer that whatever the object was (airplane, cloud, etc) would soon become apparent.  As we drove closer, the bright streaks of light dimmed considerably, eventually becoming just a greyish color, and we wondered if it could have been the setting sun which was illuminating these two streaks.  As we approached our exit, I could just make out a solid dark object above these streaks, and it was obviously much farther away than I had originally thought.  Due to the distance, I cannot describe the shape of the object, other than that it was wider side to side than it was top to bottom. It did not appear to be completely smooth, but to have some shape to it. The object and streaks did not move, rotate, etc. following the few seconds after which we originally saw them. The dark object above the streaks was not lit in any way.  We took our exit and quickly parked our car and ran back near the freeway, but whatever it was was gone.;37.5544911564625;-122.310303061225
