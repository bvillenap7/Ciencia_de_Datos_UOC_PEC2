My son and I witnessed a aircraft that looked like a flying scooter or motorcycle flying just above us, coming from the north towards the west as if it were taking the exit on the freeway but right above us just over the telephone poles even close to rooftops!!  I said whoa!  What was that...I need one of  those so I can ride you on it over the freeway too so we don't have to wait it traffic… I thought for sure it was a something new that was used to transport faster a above traffic to get to an accident or emergency or respond to a child abduction or something serious…;37.5544911564625;-122.310303061225
