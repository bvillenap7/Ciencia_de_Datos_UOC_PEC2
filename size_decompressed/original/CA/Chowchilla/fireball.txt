Then saw a bright white ball with a triangular white glow behind it. Neighbor alerted me to a strange glowing green ball in the south western sky it had a long orange streak from center of ball extending to the west.  Ball appeared as a large full moon but,like vapor the orange streak was four times the width of the ball.  I thought a test misile had been detonated.  The sky around this ball was hazy as if smoke were in the air from an explosion.  We watched it fade for several minutes. I walked behind the house and saw a BRIGHT white ball with a triangular glow heading due south toward Fresno County.  It appeared as a comet, but was not burning up.  The tail on this thing was fan shaped, but not rounded at the trailing edge it was straight edged.  I called everyone out of the house and we watched it for a couple of minutes. Several fast moving aircraft with their marker lights came into the area from the Fresno area and turned as if following a trail.  Up in the area where the ball had been,  Periodic BRIGHT flashes occured as if something was popping of strobe units for photography.  There were no marker lights visible, so if there was a helicopter hovering there, they had no running lights on.  All this took place in a fifteen minute span. Note:  My father-in-law was ((name deleted)).  Worker on the first moon lander, and a top level employee at Wright Pat, (Yes he has been in Hanger 18 and we know what was really there). I do not get excited about UFO's, but this was quite wierd so I thought I would let you check into it.;37.101;-120.2619
