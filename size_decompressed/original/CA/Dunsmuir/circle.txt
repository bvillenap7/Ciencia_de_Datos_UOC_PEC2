My fiancée and I were driving south on I-5, around Dunsmuir, California.  At around 10 PM we both witnessed a bright, circular light on the south east horizon.  We were listening to the radio and both noticed the light in the sky.   After 10 seconds it disappeared and my fiancée interrupted the silence asking, Did you just see that?  I quickly replied, YES!! I DID!  Then about another 10 seconds later to the east of us we noticed the light flickering then it dipped down in a swirling motion, leaving traces of light in it's path and it disappeared again.  My fiancée told me that when she first saw it she thought it was a giant shooting star, because it had a trace of light following it.  She was excited because she had never seen a shooting star, but then the light abruptly stopped in the sky and stayed there until it blinked out of sight (and then later appeared to the east like I described).   We know it was not a plane, it was much bigger than a star, an! d it was far too high in the sky to be a street light.   Whatever it was, we can not explain.  She never fully believed in UFO's until our experience.;41.2125;-122.2689
