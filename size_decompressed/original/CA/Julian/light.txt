Long sighting/studied lights;2006-02-25 04:00:00;3 hours;Long sighting/studied lights I was in my hometown neighborhood, on my way home from a friends house quite late at night. i noticed a bright light behind a nearby mountian. a light figure flew out. i was amazed by the beauty of the light, i saw the visible spectrum in what looked like to be tentacles, made out of bent light! i watched them enter the atmosphere in what I thought was a shooting star, which i later realized to be them entering the atmosphere. i was afraid of the light, being as it came very close to the car my friend and i had parked in. we didnt want to use our headlights in fear of startling the light. the actual light itself would expand and contract, and would sometimes resemble an angel. i watched the craft race at unhumanlike speeds and hover for three hours. the light was almost showing emotion, and stayed with us until the sun rose. i watched the light rise up until it could not be seen anymore. there were 3 total, my attention focused on one.  the main one was at low elevation,  the second one was at around what appeared to be about the middle of the atmosphere. The third was very high up, almost in outer space it appeared. They were alighned an a certian way that it looked as almost they were relaying information. I have a feeling that the creature is as curious about me as I was him. They were not hostile. They played and litterally hid in the clouds. That night was a night i will neve forget. I know the truth.;33.0534;-116.5658
