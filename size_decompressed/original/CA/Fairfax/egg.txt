5 black orbs ,in formation, gather into one egg shape form and fly off at 20 miles an hour ,at 3 thousand feet.;2004-10-18 08:00:00;5 minutes;5 black orbs ,in formation, gather into one egg shape form and fly off at 20 miles an hour ,at 3 thousand feet. I came outside to view the morning sky,the clouds etc. after checking for anything that moved, like planes ,some birds, i turn right above me just about and there was about 5 or 6 black dots about aprox. 3-4 thousand feet, as i made a double take and deciding it looked unusual,a formation, that didnt move,but suddenly they formed into one shape ,perhaps eggshaped, hard to say exactly. Before it did this , each one pusled a  light that surrounded it, then instantaneously became one and moved at about 20 miles an hour towards the south east,towards where the sun was already 20 degrees or more in the sky. I was the only one to see it take shape the others that looked couldnt figure out what i could be. One person said it might be a weather ballon and laughed at me after i said i doubted that since it was first 5 dots that formed into one shape. It might be a coinsidance but i felt that it detected i observed it and questioned what it was. This seems to be my 1st sighting. I feel it was orbs that joined together. However maybe it was alien craft ,with super small aliens?? who knows . ... please notify me if anyone else had seen this craft on that day. ((NUFORC Note:  Second report from same witness.
