black object;2004-10-18 08:00:00;10minutes;black object As i was drinking coffee on the sidewalk outside a cafe i looked up and the clouds since i was wondering if it was gonna rain. I noticed a strange formation that seemed to be a gathering of small dark objects. As it passed directely overhead, maybe 2 thousand feet or less, they gathered into one object ,hard to tell if it was rectangle or circle, it continued to fly due east . If they were birds then how come they gathered so close? I kept an eye on it as it reached the bay ,seemed to be going 20miles an hour. I'm reporting this incase someone had a better look then me . I tried to find a north calif reporting center for ufos and only found south calif. Since i listen to Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast i decided to send it to you. I've never seen birds bunch so close, perhaps they were higher up in the sky ??? and it was a optical illusion? I doubt it, because it seemed to me as it approached towards where the sun was rising ,it was clear to be on object.I felt they were probe that gathered into one shape and where heading towards east bay.  If anyone reports a simulair sighting today please notify me since i've never seen a ufo before, only in dreams. ((NUFORC Note:  Second report from same witness.  PD));37.9866;-122.5909
