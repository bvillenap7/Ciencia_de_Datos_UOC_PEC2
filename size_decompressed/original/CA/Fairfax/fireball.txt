It looked large and close. .The width appeared to be about 4-5 X the size of the moon.  It had a SUPER WHITE brightly-lit rounded front (head) that had shining pink and blues within it.  The tail was wide and long, and was just as bright as the head. We saw it for about a two and a half second duration and lost sight of it as it moved behind a low cloud. A few moments later we heard a loud boom coming from the direction of the objectâ€™s trajectory.;37.9866;-122.5909
