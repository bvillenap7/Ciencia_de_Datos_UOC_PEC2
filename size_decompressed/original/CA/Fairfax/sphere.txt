At first I thought the white orb was a helicopter w/spotlight, then realized first that it was silent,then there was no beam from the light, by this time we all were looking at it.  Then after 20-30 seconds, two orbs, one out of the top and one out of the bottom, the orb out of the top and the bottom circled clockwise, so now there is one smaller orb, large orb, small orb, in a row up and down, at this point we all are amazed at what we are seeing, then after another 20-30 seconds, the two smaller orbs each broke-exploded into 5- 6- 7- smaller orbs, then zigzagged as in the same direction as they got smaller then disappeared, which left the large orb.  After another 5-10 seconds, the large orb got smaller then gone.;37.9866;-122.5909
Light orange sphere periodically brightening and dimming;2012-06-20 23:30:00;22 minutes;Light orange sphere periodically brightening and dimming 21Jun2012 23:30 to 23:52 Pacific time  I was looking from my house in Fairfax [37 deg 59' N 122 deg 36'  elevation: 438 ft ASL] to the east [94 deg magnetic, not adjusted for magnetic deviation] about 4 degrees to the right of Mt. Diablo from my position.  [Mt Diablo is about 3,400 ft], and the elevation of object appeared 1000-1500 ft higher, but seemed closer than Diablo, on a line passing through Berkeley towards Livemore. Total observation time: 23:30 to 23:52. Weather:  clear with slight haze near horizon. No moon.  Object appeared yellow orange over approximately Berkeley [but could have been as far as Livermore], no blinking lights.  Observed it with Bausch&Lomb 20x80 binoculars on a tripod, switching to camera every few minutes.  Photographed [and viewed] through open window with 12x optical zoom 10 MP Lumix [full zoom], on highest resolution [3072 x 2304  Pixels (7.08 MPixels) (4:3 aspect ratio)] , hand-held but steadied against window frame, on setting: 'scene  night'.  One picture I deliberately 'streaked' the image by slight hand movement, to obtain additional light information such as other colors, blinking lights, etc.  Object was nearly stationary, barely moving to SW.   Object brightness slowly varied [not consistently though] over 20 seconds to 30 intervals from full brightness to invisibility [could not see it in the 20x80 either], then slowly brightening again over 20 to 30 secs.  Color varied from light orange to medium orange.  Object was a little fuzzy, even though 20x80 binocs were in sharp focus (which I checked a couple times binoculars have separate left and right eye focus.)  Addendum:  There's a lot of air traffic in the Bay area there's the SF airport and the Oakland airport.  I see all kinds of planes, and they always have blinking lights associated with them, Nor are they a steady light orange color with no additional blinking lights.  The object was higher than the general [incoming/outgoing] air traffic.  Object finally disappeared behind a hill in my foreground.  At full brightness, it was about like Venus or Jupiter, but light orange in color. At it's dimmest, it was not visible at all even when viewing through the 20x80 binoculars.  There was no noticable change in elevation, nor was there any sudden changes of position or speed.  Possible conclusion:  internally lit blimp, though this might be unlikely since, a) there were no navigation lights that I could discern b) it was operating so close to Oakland airport [class C] and San Francisco airport [class B].  The images I sent to you are direct copies from the camera's card.  736: deliberate streak to obtain more light information 739: about to fade from view 742: brightest part of brightness cycle. 743: about half way through brightness cycle;37.9866;-122.5909
Saw a brightly glowing object in the sky that was pulsating red, blue, green and white light and was completely soundless.  ((Sirius?));2013-01-03 20:15:00;10-20 minutes;I saw a brightly glowing object in the sky that was pulsating red, blue, green and white light and was completely soundless. On 3 January 2013, my son and I were watching TV in our living room.  Our breakfast nook is just off the living room and I happened to glance out of the large windows to our left.  I saw a brightly glowing object in the sky that was pulsating red, blue, green and white light.  My son asked me if I saw what was outside the window and asked we what it was.  I replied that I didn’t know and we both went outside to get a better look.  The object was almost due east of our home and we didn’t hear any sound. It was above a ridge to the east and was completely motionless.  After a few minutes I went back inside to get my binoculars and then observed the object for a minute or two. I gave the binoculars to my son to see if he could make out any details. He could not, so I got my iPad and took some still photos.  There was still no sound and the object did not move. I switched the iPad to movie mode and shot a one-minute video of the object.  Since it was rather cold we both! went back inside.  About a minute later I noticed that the object was still in the same position and still pulsating with light so I went back outside and shot another one-minute video of the object.  This all occurred at about 8:15 pm PST. The next day I examined the videos and found that what we both thought was a single light had other, clearly visible lights around it.  There seems to be a triangular shape to the lights.  I have no idea what it was that we saw but I’ve never seen anything like it before.  I enjoy seeing the night sky and know many of the constellations.  Orion was well above the object as was Jupiter.  The night was crystal clear.  I don’t know what I observed I know what I saw.  I am a high school chemistry teacher and my son is in training to be a firefighter.;37.9866;-122.5909
