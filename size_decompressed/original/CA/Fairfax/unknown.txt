BRIGHT LIGHTS MARIN COUNTY NIGHTS;2009-01-14 22:00:00;15 minutes;BRIGHT LIGHTS MARIN COUNTY NIGHTS Me and three friends were on a night hike on the Sleepy Hollow, Fairfax ridge where I hike all the time and look at the stars I noticed three lights from a distance that were in line with each other it was a full moon when we looked back at the objects they had rearranged their alignment but were not moving just hovering in the air they had really bright lights then the lights would dim off  and they would float away and all of a sudden be gone then reappear but their was always at least two of them the whole time we were their when we first saw them their was three the most we saw was about six and when we left their was two during our sighting I called the police and told them what I was seeing in the hills it was a very clear night the police called us back and said to call the ufo expert for the night we did and I told him what I was seeing  he asked me where Saturn was but I didnâ€™t know where Saturn was also one of the objects all of a sudden dropped straight down really quick faster than it could fall but stayed in the sky that was freaky the whole thing was I wish I knew what I was seeing that night maybe I will one day but for now I guess its best to keep me and everyone else wondering I do know it was a ufo what I am wondering is if it was ours or something else also the sheriffs office that called us back were really interested and said they have been getting a lot of these calls lately and the guy I spoke to on the phone he was cool to even though he was getting a little frustrated with me but I have wrote the report like I was asked to do here you go.
