Sudden;2004-10-17 08:05:00;15 mins;I had reported this last year already, but wasnt clear.  I had seen 4 or 5 black stationary dots. to the west ,at a low altitude.  Suddenly, each dot pulsed a white light that surrounded themselfs.  Then, instantaneously ,these dots formed into a flying object, at the center.  It was a cross between a rectangle and a egg-shape. (in a state or morphification?).  It then flew easternly in the sky, at a rate of 20-30 miles an hour.   I turned to 2 other people and asked them to take a look. They both saw it yet couldnt say what it was.  One decided to run into the cafe and get a camera, but by then it was too distant to photograph.  What was first black dots turned into a blue/ray object. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));37.9866;-122.5909
