While camping on the Upper Kern River, 8 miles north of Kernville, CA, we witnessed 3 separate objects approximately 30 minutes apart. They appeared to originate a short distance directly east of the river, (1 mile?). The first 2 were vertical in nature, long & thin, approximately 150 feet long, phosphorescent green glowing consistently & rising slowly as if they were a streamer from a hot air balloon. No balloon or other object was visible above the objects. The third object was 2-3 times longer & had an offset near the top 1/4 of its length. It rose very high over a period of 15-20 minutes, decended slightly & continued east until out of sight. The light from the third object undulated at times & was so long that we couldn't explain what could cause it to rise or what purpose it could be serving.;35.7582;-118.4034
