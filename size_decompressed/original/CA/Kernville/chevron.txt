Chevron Shaped vehicle with blinking red lights;2002-07-23 22:00:00;1 minute;Chevron Shaped vehicle with blinking red lights A massive V shaped pattern of lights in the sky heading south in the vicinity of Kernville, CA.  The lights were red in color and appeared similar to those found on rescue vehicles.  The object appeared to be a single structure.  The body of this aircraft looked as though it was a very dark color.  What really caught my eye was how massive this object was and how preportionally slow it was moving in the sky.  I have never seen anything like this before. but I feel extremely confident that this was not a conventional aircraft.  It was like nothing I have ever seen before.  However, I have heard of sighting of this type of aircraft by climbers around the Mt. Whitney area. ((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports.  PD));35.7582;-118.4034
