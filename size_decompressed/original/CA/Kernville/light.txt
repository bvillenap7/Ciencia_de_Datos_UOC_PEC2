There were many stars that night and it was very beautiful.   Suddenly, I noticed a star moving I guess north for a distance of about nine inches and turned left and disappear from my view.  I noticed it and my friends noticed it also.   Because we thought it wasn't real, we waited for about 15 minutes and again we noticed a star moving this time south from different location.  It also disappeared after few inches of movement.  We saw another one moving I guess west for few inches and it also disappeared.  Another one moved west for few inches and it disappeared too.   At the end, we saw two moving south simultaneous with about one inch apart.  But one on the left was wobbling a little. I don't know exactly what I saw but I did a little bit of research and I believe it's not a plane, satellite, nor meteors.  There is something about moving star but it's not located in our galaxy. ((NUFORC Note:  We, too, do not know what the witnesses observed, but we believe that satellites would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.  Satellites almost never course to the west, but parallax has to be taken into account in this case, we believe.  PD));35.7582;-118.4034
