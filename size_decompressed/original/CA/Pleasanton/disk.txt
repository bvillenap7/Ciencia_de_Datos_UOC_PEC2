I was taking my son’s friend home tonight about 8:40 PM and the boys were talking when all of a sudden my son started saying Oh my God,   So I asked what was he saying that for and he wouldn’t tell us.  At that point we were on Neal St.  Then I turned onto Stanley Blvd. and all of a sudden I saw what he was talking about. There was no mistaking that it was a saucer shaped flying craft.  It was moving very slow and it was only about 50 ft. above the tree-line. It had two red blinking lights and it was illuminated. The saucer was lit up but not really with any kind of lights familiar to me. It was like the silver metal glowed somehow. There was a bubble shaped cabin on top of it with lots of small rectangular windows going all around it, that glowed white. This was a very big disk. If compared to the moon right beside it, then the disk was bigger. It was flying tilted on its side laterally coming from a northwest direction and flying southeast. I could not stop because I was in traffic and I had to get my son’s friend home. Now I wish I had my camera with me. It was just like in the movies the way it appeared and it was so vivid. I will never forget it.;37.6736876811594;-121.881964492754
Large saucer shaped object, with many windows, which was flying slow and low to the ground  was seen tonight.;2007-11-01 20:40:00;3 minutes;Large saucer shaped object, with many windows, which was flying slow and low to the ground  was seen tonight. In the city of Pleasanton my mother, a friend (11 yrs.), and me(11 yrs.) witnessed a UFO at approximately 8:40 PM western time. We were driving in the car. I was the first to notice it. It appeared to have a greenish aurora to the metal body of the craft. The top three rows of windows and the bottom three rows of windows were square  and seemed to be windows, which were emanating an unearthly white glow. There were also two rows of circular shaped windows in the middle of the ship from my point of reference that emanated the same white glow. There were also two red lights one was located towards the top, and the other was located towards the bottom. These red lights pulsed on and off every couple of seconds. There were also many white lights that were around the edge of the craft. The lights had the same glow as the windows. The ship was located 50 to 100 feet above the tree line and was moving around 40 miles per hour. It seemed like I was looking towards the bottom and sides from my location in the back seat of the car.;37.6736876811594;-121.881964492754
