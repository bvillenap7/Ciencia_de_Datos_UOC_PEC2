Observed V formation of 10 objects flying from SE to NW over Pleasanton CA;2002-08-13 01:22:00;15 seconds;Observed V formation of 10 objects flying from SE to NW over Pleasanton CA I saw a formation of orange-colored craft, about 10 or 11, flying from the southeast to the northwest. The fly over took about 15 seconds, during which that crafts retained their forward speed but changed formation several times. The formations were single V, reversed V, multiple V's and a line, all changes were executing quickly and smoothly with no change on forward speed. I also experienced a deep sense of peace while watching these crafts fly over.;37.6736876811594;-121.881964492754
Saw a silver round object high in the sky, unsure what it could be.;2006-12-23 01:49:00;1-2min;Saw a silver round object high in the sky, unsure what it could be. I was driving my car on the way to the gym when I noticed something in the sky that looked to be at an altitude a bit higher than your normal airplane flys.  I watched it, and it seemed to be the shape of a small circle, silver colored.  It was moving slowly in the direction which I believe is to be south of where I was.  I was still driving, approaching a red light, and kept an eye on it.  Once I had a feeling that it was not an airplane, I decided I would turn left into a buisness area to get a better look.  Stopped at the red light, I was able to watch the object for a good 30-45 seconds.  I noticed it was still moving slowly (I was completely stopped), and the color appeared to be a white/silver color.  But every few seconds it would turn a darker color, almost as if it was rotating, and the other side had a different color.  Maybe it was the reflection of light on it, but that did not seem the case to me.  When the light turned green, I quickly turned and pulled into a parking lot.  When I got out to search for the object, I could not find it.  I had no idea where it had gone, maybe it was still around, but I could not see it.;37.6736876811594;-121.881964492754
