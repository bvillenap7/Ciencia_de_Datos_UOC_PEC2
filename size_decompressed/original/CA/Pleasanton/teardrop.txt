This was 6 years ago so some of the details are a little off, but here goes what I best remember. I was standing outside, playing basketball and admiring the wispy clouds when something catches my eye, a black object hovering in my peripheral.  I turn 90 degrees to see it hovering about 1000 or so feet above the ground, not rotating, just hovering there.  I take a step towards it after staring for three seconds and it instantly shoots up about 2000 more feet and hovered there for another couple seconds before jetting off over my head in a very sharp zigzagging pattern at extremely high speeds and disappearing out of sight in a matter of 5 seconds or so.  I felt uneasy afterwards and then headed back inside. My memory on this is hazy as I'd somewhat repressed it in the back of my mind until two months ago when my psychiatrist helped me remember it.  This has recently inspired me to get into the field of ufology and find out what it was I saw that day, or possibly see something like it again.

I was going approximately 75 mph, so I glanced out my side window and saw 7 or 8 objects that were shaped like teardrops or tadpoles.  They seemed to be half silver and half see thru or whitish.  They were traveling up and away and darting around and weaving with each other.   I looked at the road, then out my windshield, and saw the same thing.  I looked out the side window again and they were still there, weaving in and out of their  paths.  Then I saw my exit and planned to stop and get a better look.  But they were gone.   The sky was clear, no clouds at all.  I saw what looked like a plane in the distance, much farther, it was small and white and tubular shaped and it disappeared as well.  They seemed real, and not my imagination.  They did not look like anything I have seen on TV.  The objects did not fit any of the characteristics on the form.  It was an exciting moment.;37.6736876811594;-121.881964492754
