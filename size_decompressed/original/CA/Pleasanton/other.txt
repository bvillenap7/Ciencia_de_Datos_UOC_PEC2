One object Sighted from Sunol Grade at 6:00pm off 680 heading North hovering in place.  Blueish hue in the middle of object.  Two red lights on what appeared to be the end of the object as it seemed to be horizontal in shape, these would blink on and off in strange intervals, top to bottom, they would also switch sides in a slow and odd fashion.  One red light on Top of and white lights on bottom, green lights that blink turn on every once in a while.  At bottom of grade at Livermore Exit Object appeared to hover in place as planes flew within close proximity of object.  Object seemed to transform shape or move lights and could be seen clearly at this point.  Lost Object eventually behind eastern hills as I continued North on 680 until Bernal Exit.  Sighted in the southern sky at this point still alternating lights and hovering slowly gliding east.   Chased object easterly through Pleasanton until an end road off Vineyard Ave.  Stopped car at dead end and exited car.  Watched object for another five or six minutes as it still hovered about 400-500 feet from where I stood.  No engine or propeller noises were heard object seemed very quiet, you could only faintly hear the traffic off Stanley Blvd.  Object came close to horizon floating toward Stanley Boulevard. Could not get pictures or video with my phone camera, which is all I had with me at the time since I was on my way home from work. Object seemed invisible to the phones camera CCD. Object seemed to avoid horizon as I could almost make out the shape, but it glided north over Stanley Boulevard toward the Rock quarries and disappeared out of site.  Time was 6:45pm at this point...Object never seen again.;37.6736876811594;-121.881964492754
Being/Creature/Object Photo.;2018-04-01 12:42:00;2 seconds;Being/Creature/Object Photo. Hello, I find that taking photos when the planes are spraying, often reveals anomalous images.  I took this with my cell phone camera. There were no birds flying in the area at which the camera was pointed.  Also, I did not see this Being/Creature/Object with my eyes when I took the photos – I could only see the plane. Less than 2 seconds later, I took another shot, and the strange Being/Creature/Object is not visible, but the plane is, and from my viewing point, it has not moved very far from where it was in the first photo.;37.6736876811594;-121.881964492754
I witnessed a constant herd of  hundreds of satellites travel across the sky for 33 minutes.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-19 21:45:00;33 minutes;While walking my dog I witnessed a constant &quotherd&quot of  hundreds of satellites travel across the sky for 33 minutes. While walking my dog on Tuesday from 9:45-10:18 ((p.m.)), I witnessed a constant flow of hundreds of satellites travel across the sky for roughly 33 minutes. The satellites were traveling from a north east to south west direction.  It looked as if someone cast a net of hundreds of satellites over the sky.  They traveled in the same direction were similar sizes and moved at the same constant speed.  The sky was so full of these satellites that it reminded me of watching rush hour traffic on the freeway.  I watched until the “satellite traffic” thinned out and cloud cover obstructed my view. I want to make it clear that I saw HUNDREDS of satellites and these were not the Star Link constellation or any type of meteor shower.  I am an avid sky watcher and know that these were satellites.  I realize that you collect UFO sightings, but I didn't know where else to share what I witnessed.  I’m curious to know if anyone else reported seeing them or if anyone knows what their purpose might be.;37.6736876811594;-121.881964492754
