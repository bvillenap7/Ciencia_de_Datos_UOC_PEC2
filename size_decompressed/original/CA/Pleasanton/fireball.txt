It was a straight dowm drop from the larger object. The second object we saw was Northwest from where we were standing in our back yard in Pleasanton CA. This 2nd object was red-yellow and also very bright in appearance, It appeared to fire sometype of projectile to the South, the projectile was quick and as it shot-out from the object it was fast then slowed and disappeared. Were there any rockets or NASA type crafts in our area last night?? also both objects stayed in the same area for a good 45 mins---till we gave up and went to bed.. Would appreciate a response... We are a married couple in Pleasanton CA. My husband has worked at a local Car Manufacture Co, for 27 years. We had not been drinking and were completely sober. We were the only 2 witnesses, as far as we know.I'm sure there is a good explianation for these weird objects!;37.6736876811594;-121.881964492754
Firework like spark close to ground with an oddly high and long Chem trail behind it.;2014-01-19 17:30:00;2 seconds;Firework like spark close to ground with an oddly high and long Chem trail behind it. While a passenger in a car, I noticed what I thought to be a shooting star, but when it dissipated saw it was quite a bit closer to the ground, maybe 100' high.  It flashed orange and yellow, and must have been around the size of a softball. When I looked back to the sky toward where the object would've come from there was a trail like that from a jet coming from very high up and coming down to about 100' off the ground. Also strangely not noticed was any sound whatsoever. A plane was nearby, flying towards it when it occurred.;37.6736876811594;-121.881964492754
