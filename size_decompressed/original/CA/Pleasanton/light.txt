4 bright orange lights in the sky.;2017-12-21 20:08:00;4 minutes;4 bright orange lights in the sky. I was outside in the backyard when I noticed a bright orange light in the sky.  When I saw another light behind it, I called my daughter and her dad to make sure I wasn’t seeing things.  We then noticed two more lights coming up behind them.  The lights went sideways before it started to dim and disappear one by one.  We didn’t hear any sounds coming from it.;37.6736876811594;-121.881964492754
We saw 3 bright lights in a tight configuration not moving in any particular direction.  They looked stationary.;2018-06-28 22:15:00;10 minutes;We saw 3 bright lights in a tight configuration not moving in any particular direction.  They looked stationary but with some slight drift over time.  The 3 lights began to form a triangle shape and it seemed to be almost a equidistant ole triangle but a little off.  Shortly after the triangle formed a 4th light appeared in the same tight cluster.  After seeing these craft and just finishing a film shoot we pulled over and grabbed our camera out of the hatchback.   We stopped and took some photos and a video clip.  One of the lights slowly flew off into the west.  The lights were most likely between Pleasanton and Fremont, CA. at an altitude much lower then commercial airliners, but wouldn't be out of the ordinary height for a helicopter. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness has submitted two high-quality night photos, showing an almost full Moon, and four much smaller lights in a triangular formation.  We do not know what the lights are.  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and found him to be quite serious-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD));37.6736876811594;-121.881964492754
