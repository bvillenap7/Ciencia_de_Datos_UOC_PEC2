An object was seen to the west (over the ocean) that was flashing many different colored lights.  The lights were red, yellow, and green in color.  The movement of the object was most peculiar because it moved quickly and not in a straight line.  It would move left, then stop, then up, then stop, then right, stop, further right, sudden movement to the left, down, left... there was no particular pattern to the movement, it just didn't look like the movement of an airplane or a helicopter.  Myself and one other person watched the object for about half an hour before it disappeared behind a roof line and we could no longer see it.  There was no noise, but it may have been quite far away it was difficult to tell the distance from our home at night.  Both observers are college educated, but neither of us are experts in aircraft identification.  Would like to know if what we saw was really that strange, or an optical illusion, or what!;40.9465;-124.0834
