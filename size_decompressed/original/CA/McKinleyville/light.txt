THe light got more Redish ornge as it got lower in the horizion. But the radicul Movment continued. THis deffanetly wasn't a PLane or helacopter or satalight or jet. It moved way to fast and jumped around. I tryed to get it on film but the light was to small and couldn't pick it up on my Vidio cam.;40.9465;-124.0834
