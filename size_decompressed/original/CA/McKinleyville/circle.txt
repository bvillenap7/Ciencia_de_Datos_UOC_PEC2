Orange floating light over McKinleyville;2012-11-08 01:59:00;5 minutes;Orange floating light over McKinleyville We saw an orange light moving kind of fast towards us, it looked like a plane but then it just stopped, it stayed in one spot for quite awhile and then traveled the other direction, and then disappeared.  There was an airplane above it traveling slow.   I actually fly RC Planes with LEDs on them and i can assure you it was not one, even though there are some in the same general area.;40.9465;-124.0834
