Unidentified object in Montara sky.;2015-01-07 06:50:00;40 seconds;Unidentified object in Montara sky. Was walking my dog back from the beach, when I noticed an object in the distance.  I assumed it must have been a helicopter from a strange angle.   As it got closer I couldn't see the cylindrical length of it like I would have expected, nor could I see any propellors or hear any sounds from it.  It appeared to be almost above me, but still hundreds of feet in the air.  I saw a single light coming from it and the rest of it appeared bluish greenish.   It was a very clear blue sky, so that may have played a part in it.  My dog noticed nothing.   I went to call my husband to tell what I was seeing and once I got ahold of him and looked back up, it was gone.   Maybe it was a fancy adult toy...I am a lady in my early thirties.   I have never seen anything unlike this before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.5473;-122.5116
