Star/Satellite like object in the sky that changed direction;2009-07-14 23:00:00;30 seconds;Star/Satellite like object in the sky that changed direction My friend and I were camping in Sequoia National Park, in the Dorst Creek campground. This campsite is appoximately 8k feet in elevation with no cell phone reception nor many lights. It was around 23:00 hours and we were looking up at the sky and how clear it was. I saw a white star like object pass slowly across the sky and pointed it out to him, saying it was a satellite, as I have observed satellites in the past. We sat for approximately 10 more minutes looking up at the sky, as we observed 2 more satellites pass by during this time. Each one moved across the sky at a steady rate of speed in a continuous, uninterrupted direction. About a minute or so later, we observed another star like object. This object moved as the other satellites previously had, at a steady speed and direction. Yet about 2/3 of the way across the sky, the object made a 45 degree sharp turn, continuing at the same rate of speed it had been moving at, but now headed in a southern direction. We both witnessed this and both of us turned to each other in astonishment.;36.437;-118.8919
Watched and recorded a UFO (for 4.5 hours) in the skies over the Giant Sequoia National Forest. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus or Jupiter?  PD));2010-07-17 00:12:00;4.5 Hours;On the night of June 16, I watched and recorded a UFO (for 4.5 hours) in the skies over the Giant Sequoia National Forrest. On the evening of July 16, 2010, I witnessed an Unidentified Flying Object over the Giant Sequoia Forrest in the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The object resembled a star, although this particular light was twice as bright as any star in the sky, and the light emitted was not consistent with the other stars in the sky.   The object began to move in various directions (upward, free-fall, diagonal, side to side on a perfectly level plane.)   The craft also had the ability to stop and remain perfectly still in the sky. The craft moved through the sky coming very close to my position.   Throughout the evening I recorded the craft with my iPhone video camera.  While the details of the videos are not recognizable, the movements and lights from the craft are visible on my footage.   To my knowledge, there is no current man-made craft capable of maneuvering like the craft I watched.  What I saw is unlike anything that I have ever experienced in my life.
