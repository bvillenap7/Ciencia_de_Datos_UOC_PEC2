Sitting on my sister's deck outside watching the sky in Arnold, CA. which is in the Sierra Foothills, elevation 4000 ft.. First sighting, was an object that looked like a star crossing the sky faster and higher than an airplane with no sound and no other lights visible traveling south to north. Two of the 4 adults spotted the object. Second sighting, all four adults spotted the star-like object which appeared to come back from a north to south direction in a zig zag pattern. Third sighting, all four adults spotted this star-like object which appeared again in the sky from a west to east direction.  All three sightings happened within a 20 min. interval and watched until they were no longer visible. We are four adults, 1 college student, 1 retiree, 1 San Francisco Police Detective, and 1 secretary with the MDUSD.;38.3145;-120.2648
