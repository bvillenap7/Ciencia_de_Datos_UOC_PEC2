I saw in total of 3 objects flying across the pink super moon.  The first two flew left to right together, crossing the moon in about 7 seconds.  The third object passed the moon from right to left in the same amount of time.  The moon at that time was above a grove of pine trees .  I saw the objects through my celestron power 60AZ telescope.;37.9675;-122.2899
