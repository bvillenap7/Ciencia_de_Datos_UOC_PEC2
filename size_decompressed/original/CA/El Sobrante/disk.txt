I got up, let the dog outside and noticed a completely silent, but lighted object in sky. It was brightly lit (white light) and there were very bright flashing lights (white light) directly underneath which were either rotating or pulsating from different areas underneath... no pattern to flashing. The object was travelling South to North, although at first it seemed to be stationary for about 1 minute or so. It slowly made its way to the horizon and left my field of view. Initially I would estimate it may have been approximately  1 mile beyond my location travelling North. Perhaps this was some sort of military craft, although completely silent. Travis AFB is North of my location... very strange indeed. I only wish I had grabbed my video camera. I was just standing there trying to figure out what I was seeing. This is the first time that I have ever seen anything like this and have heard of your website through Art Bell's radio show.;37.9675;-122.2899
