But these crafts were in a single line all spaced apart evenly traveling from north to west it started at 5:20 last one i saw was 5:48am.  Also there was other ones passing but jot in formation just different routes.  Btw they were traveling fast and there was no noise at all you would think all these flying objects and no sound!?
