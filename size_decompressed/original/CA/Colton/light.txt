Faint red star orbits Saturn and flies rapid sawtooth pattern.;2004-07-02 21:15:00;2 minutes;Faint red star orbits Saturn and flies rapid sawtooth pattern. While standing in my yard looking 30 degrees up from the horizon due west at what I think was Saturn, a very close fainter star suddenly moved and made a full orbit of saturn in about 2 seconds. It then moved about, performing rapid sawtooth patterns and normal linear movements and pauses. I called a family member to bring some binoculars. With them the object still looked like a star, red in color and of constant radiance. I lost the object as it moved lower in the sky and blended with the haze of the city lights. Having a masters in physics, and having worked 7 years in aerospace on missile programs, I know of nothing man made that could have flown the pattern this thing did, pulling tremendous G's to reverse direction the way it did.;34.0284000000001;-117.2872
