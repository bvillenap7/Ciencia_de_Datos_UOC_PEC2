Bright White Round Light;2003-12-11 23:00:00;3 minutes;Bright White Round Light I was sitting on our balcony on the starboard side of the coral princess when I noticed a bright white round ball like the size of a volleyball. At first I thought it was a balloon, but then realized that there was no way it could be a balloon. It was following the ship at the same speed and the wind was coming over the bow of the ship at an angle that would have blown it away. It rose straight up and then down, right and left and then  came back to it's original height. I awoke my husband and he stood there for about 20 seconds before it took off and went over the starboard bow in front of the bridge. I didn't hear any noise except for the sound of the wake our ship was making. We don't know what to think, maybe a ufo or a spy drone?? Would love to know.
