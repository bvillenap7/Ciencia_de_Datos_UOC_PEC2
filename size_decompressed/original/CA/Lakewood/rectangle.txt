I have never heard that noise at night or in the day, ever, and I started to become concerned that it was getting closer I couldn’t see anything until  It came into my sight directly from where the sound had been coming from and getting louder,  I first spotted it floating and rising above the neighbors back trees which were taller than my neighbors 2 story house,   it appeared to be of a black dark color and as it then made its way over the electric lines just starting to float over my property, I panicked because I had never seen anything like that before, it was long, rectangular, inside the back end of it was an orange glowing like fire ball, showing through it’s somewhat opaque black shell. I was so frightened I ran and hid on the side of my house waiting for it to pass. My dog didn’t seem fazed by it, sat and watched it pass I thought they might have seen me I couldn’t even speak or go and wake up my husband I was so stunned  I stood and watched it leave from floating over my house and on its journey As its intermittent sound continued I listened to it until I could not longer hear it anymore. When I watched it float above my huge pine tree in my front yard I could hear air passing over the pine needles  It seemed to float just above and clear every tree or roof or electric lines I was pretty affected by this and couldn’t stop looking upwards for several years ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
