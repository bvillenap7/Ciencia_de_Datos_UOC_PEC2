Red streak moving across the sky.;2014-12-12 19:25:00;5 minutes;Red streak moving across the sky. It started as a small red streak going by then changed to just a red moving dot.  It then went back to the streak but then appeared to have a v shaped white light in front of it.  After the v shape got bigger and wider it slowly disappeared.;33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
Thought it was a drone, but it changed shape and made acrobatic moves before traveling up away from the earth.;2019-09-09 20:47:00;5 minutes;Thought it was a drone, but it changed shape and made acrobatic moves before traveling up away from the earth. I was looking up at the moon.  Several degrees below the moon I thought I saw a drone, however, there were no blinking lights or sounds.  It must've been much higher up than I thought.  It traveled from the southern sky to the eastern.  As it got to the eastern part of the sky, it seemed to elongate, and then change shape again -- for awhile it looked like a hawk doing barrel rolls. When it was done with the acrobatics, it must've decided to go vertical because it went from having a visible tangible shape to looking like any other star in the sky, and then the cloud cover made it disappear.;33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
