Two red softly glowing round objects as your guest described on coast to coast 15 sec apart in 1995;1995-06-15 00:00:00;15 seounds;Two red softly glowing round objects as your guest described on coast to coast 15 sec apart in 1995 I only write this because the UFO that is described on the Coast to Coast website this morning 12/20/03 was something that I saw about six years ago. My 5 year old son and I were sleeping outdoors to watch for shooting stars and watched a redish softly glowing object travel from west to east. I measured it's size the same way your guest did. I estimated the first objest to be the size of a dime and the secound objest a bit larger, maybe a nickle. Looking at the first object I wasn't sure if it was round or not because it wasn't close enough. I thought it was but I wasn't sure. About ten or fifteen secounds later the secound object flew over and it was close enough to know that it was round. There was no noise and I would never have seen it had I not been looking up and in that direction. It was a soft red glow and I described it to a friend like the reflection of a red flashlight beam on a piece of aluminum. I just thought that it was interesting that you described something so close to what I saw that many years ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
