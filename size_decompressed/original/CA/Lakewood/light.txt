Single white star-like light traveling from north to south observed for about 8 to 10 seconds before disipating;2000-06-10 21:23:00;8 seconds;Single white star-like light traveling from north to south observed for about 8 to 10 seconds before disipating I was sitting in a chair outside my house facing east, when I looked up at about 75-80 degrees, almost straight up and saw what appeared to be a star moving slowly from north to south. It covered an arc of about 10-12 degrees and then rapidly disipated. I checked Heavens-Gate to see if an Iridium flare was due in that region of the sky, but it nearest event was expected about 30 degrees to the west and on another course. I was kind of surprised, as not a lot of stars were visible as it was a typical hazy evening. ((NUFORC Note:  The description seems consistent with the sighting of a satellite in polar orbit, but that is only a guess.  However, we have no explanation as to why an orbitting object would disappear from sight, the way a satellite coursing to the east would do.  PD));33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
Single red light hovering for 20 minutes below the cloud cover.;2001-11-28 22:30:00;20 Minutes;Single red light hovering for 20 minutes below the cloud cover. Lakewood, CA, USA (N33.8xx W118.1xx Elv:14m) At about 2230, my wife and I went to our front porch to smoke a cigarette. We immediately noticed to our North at about 25-30 degrees above the horizon, a stationary red light hovering below the cloud cover. After about 5 minutes of no movement by the object, I called 911 and attempted to report what we saw. The 911 operator told me they had multiple calls about the object and they did not know what it was. I then called my son from inside the house and he also observed the object. During the course of events, the object began to randomly pulse, sometime disappearing completely, then returning. At times, it appeared to be emitting and/or absorbing what looked like white static electric discharges, but that may have been an optical illusion on my part. There were commercial aircraft in the LAX landing pattern farther north of the object, that may have seen it at around 2250. During the 20-minute observation from my POV, the object's only movement was to drift from west to ease by about 4-6 degrees and gain some altitude. The object continued to pulse until it seemed to drift out of sight up into the clouds or departed at about 2254. We called a friend in Garden Grove, located about 6 miles SSW of our location, but they could not see the object. We had no camera to record the event, but there should be multiple reports logged with the L.A. County Sheriff's 911 dispatch between 2230 and 2254. This is the 4th red light event I have seen in my 43 years and I have no idea if this is terrestrial (DOD?) technology or E.T.;33.84762294686;-118.115295652174

triangle formation;2009-06-10 19:30:00;2 minutes;triangle formation Another series of 3 lights moving towards each other, forming a triangle, moving in unison as a triangle and then disappearing.  This occurred twice between 19:30 and 20:00 in the southwestern sky.  It would be difficult to believe that radar at LAX did not perceive anything, it seemed as if it was right in front of them over the channel, and 30 degrees up.  Definitely not aircraft as air traffic in the area was identifiable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.84762294686;-118.115295652174

The 2 objects moved fast in formation, one trailing the other constantly maintaining the same distance.  Then the objects seemed to just vanish. There was no vapor trail or burning debris or red or green strobe lights either.;33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
Strange bright object hoovering above the house in Lakewood,CA;2013-08-13 22:00:00;1 hour;Strange bright object hoovering above the house in Lakewood,CA Well it was a clear night the moon was almost full.  Went out back around 10-11PM looked up and there was a star or SUPER BRIGHT LIGHT which appeared to be beside the moon, the moon at a distance this bright star closer to us.  I asked my boyfriend wtheck he thought the light was and he said oh, that is just a helicopter!   I stood there a while intrigued watching and listening for movement and noise.  There was no noise and if one stood and watched it you could see it floated and moved not far but just in the spot it was in.  So I go back inside after awhile I came back out and IT WAS STILL THERE!!!  I was stunned because no matter what my boyfriend said, it was no helicopter, plane or star!!!  I still makes me obsessed to try to understand or find an explanation for the thing we saw???   Well, my boyfriend agreed after awhile he did not have a clue what it was, he agreed it was amazing but really did not trip on it like me. The sighting! started around 10 or 11PM and that star, plane, helicopter, or UFO STAYED HOOVERING IN THAT SAME VACINITY TILL AROUND 3AM!!!!  I stayed up the whole time till finally I went out and it was gone.  I took a couple of pictures and recorded a video on my cell phone so glad I did!!! what is strange is the PICTURES, that is how it appeared in the sky and to the eye.  In the video that is not how it looked with my eyes only???  In the video it changes to all these colors???  It always appeared as a super bight white star.;33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
Blue light with strange maneuvers in the skies of Southern California.;2015-11-04 21:00:00;~5 minutes;Blue light with strange maneuvers in the skies of Southern California. Last night as my boyfriend and I were out for our nightly walk, he pointed out a bright blue light in the sky.  The light went up pretty fast then dropped mid sky in close proximity to a plane.   It then moved left towards the plane, stayed there for a while then backed away again.  The light went back up kind of fast, and proceeded to drop towards earth slowly until out of sight.   Object was not observed going back up to the sky.   There were 2 aircraft's in the vicinity of the sighting and they remained there for a long time, as if they were looking for it or waiting for it to go back into the sky.;33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
