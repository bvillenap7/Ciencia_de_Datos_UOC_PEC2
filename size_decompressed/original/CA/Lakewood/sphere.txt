Small bright orb appeared about 15 feet from me.;2003-08-20 22:30:00;20 seconds;Small bright orb appeared about 15 feet from me. The date and time are approximate. I never believed this stuff was real so I just dismissed it.  I was sitting out on my front porch late one summer night and saw this sphere appear just above my rooftop. It could not have been more than 15 feet away from me. There was a full moon out and it paled in comparison to this orb. It was the brightest light that I have ever seen but it did not hurt my eyes. In the center of the sphere another bright light was moving extremely fast in the infinity pattern. I believe it was there for about 20 seconds, it could have been more or less than that. I have no memory of seeing it appear or vanish. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
Bright dots looked like balloons. Moving slowly and forming a triangle in the sky.;2007-10-07 04:30:00;10 minutes;Bright dots looked like balloons. Moving slowly and forming a triangle in the sky. I was at a Park in Lakewood with my husband and our 3 little children. They ran to have some water then my husband looked to the sky and ask me to see.  There were white spheres that looked like balloons. 3 of them formed a triangle and the other 2 followed them in line.  I do not know what that was.  I have never believed in UFO's but this sighting made me so confused and can't stop thinking about it and wish next time I'll have a camera.;33.84762294686;-118.115295652174

Right after a military helicopter approaching from the west, heading east flew over and also an F-15 flew very high over our house for at least an hour, looking for something.;33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
