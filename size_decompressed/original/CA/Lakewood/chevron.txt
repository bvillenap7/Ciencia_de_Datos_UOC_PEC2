While adjusting a new motion sensor light I installed, my wife & I were outside last night talking to a neighbor who was walking by. I was looking for the Orion constallation, when I saw what I thought were stars moving. They were the same color as the stars (blue tint) , not like a plane marker lights-white or blinking.Living near the Long Beach airport I've seen many. As I told my wife and neighbor to look at what I was seeing , I realized that there was no engine noise and they didn't know where to look. I pointed to the chevron, but it was not bright enough to stand out among the other stars . Still they couldn't find it in the sky. It had made a path from the southeast to the northwest and was  in the path of a streetlight and now couldn't be seen without blocking the light with a hand which they didn't do. I followed it past the street light and the chevron faded out. They looked at me funny not seeing anything. I told them you didn't see anything but you also didn't hear anything. Then I pointed out planes in the distance and said but those you can hear. I wasn't sure what it was, but you would have to been looking directly at it to notice it in the sky;33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
