fast-moving fireball;2005-07-17 00:41:00;2-3 minutes;fast-moving fireball We witnessed a fast-moving, brightly-lit, circular type object, which appeared to be on fire.  It moved in a south-east direction and seemed to be falling while emitting periodic flashes of orange light/fire on various sides.  It first seemed to fall very rapidly then sped off without falling.  Anyway, nothing we had ever seen before.;33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
Dripping ball of light;2006-10-03 22:00:00;4min;Dripping ball of light I was driving down some back streets which made the sky really dark. I had the sunroof open that night just to enjoy the night. While driving I looked up through the sunroof and noticed a fairly large orange, redish, yellow ball in the night sky. It caught my attention because it was too large to be a star. When I realized that it wasnt a star or plane I was stunned. I pulled over without taking my eyes off this thing and before I could park it began to drip like a candle. I almost crashed! I got out tripping over my own foot and stood still looking at this crazy site. It dripped again and again!! The drips burned as they fell from this object. What was this ball of light dripping like a candle. It began to change colors (orange/yellow/red) and flickered. Suddenly it flickered out!! Amazing!! All of a sudden it comes back on!!  Flickers for a minute and goes out like it was never there. I was stunned. This light was very large to be a star and very hard to miss.

Diamond fire flames slow dancing.;2015-10-10 22:00:00;3 minutes;Diamond fire flames slow dancing. While driving home I looked up and saw 2 diamond shape fire flames.  I pulled over to the curb.  My friend and I watch these thing's travel real slow in unison.  They were about 350 feet up and were about 10 feet apart, one being above the other.  They looked like golden flames and seemed to be as big as a beach ball from where we were. they started to get closer to each other.  We thought they were going to merge.  They didn't.  They stopped for a moment then one took off towards the North west going low and the other went high. then tiny lights that weren't showing before blinked slowly.  Then it went a bit higher, the tiny lights went off and it disappeared.;33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
