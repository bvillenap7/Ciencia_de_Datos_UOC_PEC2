Object was traveling east to west high in the sky and was of an orange color with no flashing lights or strobes.  It was traveling at a relatively high rate of speed, slowed to a stop and disappeared.

Large red pulsating light vanished.;2020-01-27 22:28:00;1 minute;Large red pulsating light vanished. Dad called me to the backdoor and said, check this out. Large red pulsating light located in southern sky in stationary location. As another identified plane on a straight trajectory path headed toward it, the object went dark. Definitely an odd situation as large red pulsating lights typically do not just disappear.;33.84762294686;-118.115295652174
