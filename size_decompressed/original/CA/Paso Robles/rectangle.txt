Huge and motionless no lights and a silver or grey color rectangular in shape;2000-11-10 16:00:00;10 minutes;Huge and motionless no lights and a silver or grey color rectangular in shape The object was huge, seemed to be square shaped and was quite high in the sky. It was the sky. It was motionless and had no lights that I could see. I was outside in my yard when I first saw it.  I came in and went outside again to see if it was still there and it was. It just was sitting there.  I went in again and when I came out it was gone.  It appeared to be a silver or grey color but I couldn't really see as it was so high.  The thing that impressed me was it's size, huge like a football field or larger.;35.6415898203594;-120.700931137724
Gray/White object moving very fast photographed over Paso Robles.  ((NUFORC Note:  Hummingbird or cicada, we suspect.  PD));2013-05-19 10:37:00;seconds;Gray/White object moving very fast photographed over Paso Robles. I was taking photos of a real estate listing on the morning of 5/19.  Whenever I take exterior photos, I take multiple photos in a burst.   When I got home to process the photos I saw that this photo had what I first thought was dust or a bird. However, upon zooming in to remove it,  I noticed that it didn't look like any dust or bird that I had ever seen.  To me, it looked like a strange aircraft.   None of the other photos in the burst had this in it... which leads me to believe that it was moving VERY fast since the images were taken at 1/1250 sec with roughly 4 images taken in a second. I am a professional photographer and out of the 30,000+ photos I have taken, I have never seen anything like this show up in a photo. ((NUFORC Note:  Hummingbird or cicada, we suspect.
