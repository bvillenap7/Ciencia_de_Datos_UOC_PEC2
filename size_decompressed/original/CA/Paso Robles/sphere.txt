I  followed it with the binoculars, it then changed direction and I lost sight of it, this was very weird!;35.6415898203594;-120.700931137724

I heard a low flying small airplane flying overhead which caused me to look up. When I looked up I saw a white, round, ball traveling at very high speed from the northwest to the southeast. I observed it for about 10 seconds. Weather was clear blue sky, sunny day. Absolutely positive, object was round with no wings or other appendages.;35.6415898203594;-120.700931137724
