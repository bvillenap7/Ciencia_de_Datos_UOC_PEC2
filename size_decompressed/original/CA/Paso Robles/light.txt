Very bright, Color-Changing Light Seen Above Foothills Moving in Left-Right and Up and Down Pattern;2000-06-29 01:00:00;Approx. 1+ hours;Very bright, Color-Changing Light Seen Above Foothills Moving in Left-Right and Up and Down Pattern I have never, in all my years of watching the skies (amateur), felt the extreme need to REPORT an unusual sighting....I usually will rationalize things out in my mind (i.e.... nearby airports, flight paths, weather conditions, etc)...But on the night of June 29th, 2000, I witnessed a strange very bright ball of light that would change colors from red-blue-yellow and sometimes green.... Let me give you some background information as to my location....I live in a rather remote area, 15 miles from the nearest town.  The few neighbors that i have were asleep at the time of the sighting, as was my husband.  I was awake at 0100 hours to let my dog out to defecate...I have a back wood deck and behind the deck is a partially wooded area (Oak trees)and a very remote/unpopulated area that stretches on for approximately one half mile to the large foothills (1/2 mile away).  I stood on my back deck as my dog walked the remote area behind my deck (as aforementioned above)...I looked out at the night sky, as I often do, and was immediately drawn (my eye caught sight of) a VERY bright light that was directly over the nearest foothill to me  (this area would be to the west)...The object, as mentioned, would change colors (MUCH more dramatically than the twinkling i have seen of a star, and I could directly visualize in the very clear night sky, the silhouette of the foothill-top with large trees/etc as points of reference.  It was in using these points of reference that I was able to watch the object move (what i would term 'gently float' left to right then up and down....I estimate that it would move within 1/4 - 1/2 mile of its original place in the sky, as it moved right-left and up and down....At no time did i see it land on the hill, but at times it appeared to be no more than perhaps 100 feet or so from the hilltop.  I watched the object for about 5-10 minutes outside, and then returned inside to inform my husband.  My husband was asleep, and thereby I COULD not inform him at the time (Needless to say i ! did try to wake him up..but my attempt was futile).  I went into my daughters room and watched the object through her levolor blinds for about an hour more...It was still continuing with the same readily apparent movements and color changes..... I attempted to sleep, but awoke after 1/2 hour..looked out the window again and the light was gone.  I am a professional nurse, educated, married and well-respected.. I have never felt the need to report an event before...But I truly feel this was an unusual phenomena.;35.6415898203594;-120.700931137724

Intense Red Light Observed over Paso Robles, CA.;2015-09-27 19:15:00;5 minutes;Intense Red Light Observed over Paso Robles, CA. We were outside to observe the Lunar Eclipse under a heavily clouded sky when we observed an intense red light suddenly traverse the sky rapidly from the South.  The light moved directly overhead where it remained stationary for 3 minutes.  It had lost its red overall color and its intensity, now bright white, yet retaining its red core.   It slowly drifted eastward, began to fade out, then suddenly bursting back to its prior glow.  It soon went out after 5 minutes.  It was backlit sufficiently for us to see a black object in the lights place.   We observed the object fly off in a due east direction at a high rate until we lost it in the tree line.  The object made no sound.;35.6415898203594;-120.700931137724

7 Bright orange hovering objects in sky above Paso Robles Ca;2017-04-07 19:16:00;4 minutes;7 Bright orange hovering objects in sky above Paso Robles Ca I was driving home, was dark and stormy out.  I looked out to the right of my car, above the mountain range where I noticed 3 bright orange lights hovering.  They almost looked like fireballs.  They moved slightly back and forth then another object appeared, the same bright glowing orange.  It swooped around a bit as the others hovered.   It then split into two forming another glowing flying object.  They flew around in a random pattern not leaving that specific area.  Two more bright orange lights appeared right above them and hovered for a couple of minutes.  One of the lower objects disappeared leaving six bright glowing flying objects.   I pulled my car over to take a picture and then they were gone.  It was a truly strange experience, it was not normal and definitely not something that anyone would see everyday. I do believe whole heartedly that I truly saw a UFO.;35.6415898203594;-120.700931137724
