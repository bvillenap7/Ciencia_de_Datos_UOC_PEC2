White objects faded into mist.;2014-09-12 06:00:00;35 seconds;White objects faded into mist I am a ((deleted--law enforcement)) and my wife is an ((deleted--medical)) tech.  I was taking her to work at 0600 and she was standing by the car staring up at the sky.  I was walking towards her and asked what was she doing.  She just pointed to the sky behind me and said nothing.  I turned around and was surprised to see a bright white object moving very slowly.  Only way I could describe it would be for you to picture driving your car at night and to see a motorcycle coming towards you.  It would be about the size and shape of on coming headlights.  Well, as we were both staring at it, speechless, it slowly looked as if it just kind of faded away.  Slowly dispersing into the atmosphere.  It seemed like it faded into most and then it was gone.   It was a clear bright sky.  So how it turned to mist baffled me.   My wife and I just looked at each other, confused.   We just went to the car at that point.  I then came home and reported it here.;35.6415898203594;-120.700931137724
