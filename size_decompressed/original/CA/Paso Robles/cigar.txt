Submarine saucer in the skies- daylight!;1990-07-15 12:00:00;5 seconds;Submarine saucer in the skies- daylight! I picked Cigar shape, but it was more like a submarine sandwich shape. I was driving home my in-laws after a visit in the countryside of town. I glanced over at the hills and saw this HUGE thing hovering over the hill. Looked like a saucer but mor oblong in shape, like a sub sandwich. I had to pull my car over to look at it again (in case another car came by) I just sat there flabbergasted and looked around to see if anyone else was around to share in this experience, but there were no cars, and this was in the middle of the afternoon. I did not have a camera with me, and this was before cell phones. It was massive, and I do not remember a lot of  the details except that I didn’t see any lights on it, but what MAY be a few black windows? I am not sure. However, it didn’t last long and it disappeared straight up into the sky and vanished. Nobody believed me when I got home sadly, and my husband said not to tell anyone else because “they will think you are crazy” is what he said. I often think about that day, and I have shared with a few people since then. Seeing this site, I see there have been many! I am trying to go through all the stories and locate the exact date to see if anyone else may have seen the same one I did. But I’m not exact on the date. I only remember it was late 80’s early 90’s because it was after my son was born. On Lake Nacimiento Road.;35.6415898203594;-120.700931137724

fireball followed by unusual aircraft;2008-09-06 23:30:00;12 seconds;fireball followed by unusual aircraft Myself & friend. 2 male adults were outside facing west about midnight , I saw a flaming fireball travel northeast, duration 3-seconds, not a brief meteor.   As I was still staring at that spot I saw a cigar shaped dim object come in to veiw immidiatly at that spot.  It appeared about 5000 feet high.  I could see a a fulsilage.  But when I told my friend to turn and look, he could only see a flaming red light on the tail.   There was no sound following whatsoever and there were no FAA lights at Fireball followed by unuall.   The object traveled our full length of view across the sky in about four seconds, much too fast for an aircraft.   This event did take place due south of Camp Roberts, CA.;35.6415898203594;-120.700931137724
