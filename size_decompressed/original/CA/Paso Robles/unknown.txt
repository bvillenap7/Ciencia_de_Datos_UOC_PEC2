Erratic moving object in southern Paso Robles Sky moves forward, backwards and vertically at high speeds.;2007-07-02 22:00:00;2 minutes;Erratic moving object in southern Paso Robles Sky moves forward, backwards and vertically at high speeds. My daughter, nephew and I were outside at around 10pm petting our horses, facing the southern sky and thought what we first saw was a plane, but the red, green and white blinking lights where not like a regular plane  - they were irregular and bolder. The way this object began to move around was definitely not like any jet, acrobatic plane (I’ve been to many air shows), helicopter or anything I’ve seen. It gyrated, back and forth, sort of wobbling, then scooped down like it was going to crash, shot back up again vertically, hovered a bit, gyrated AGAIN - even moving backwards, and then swooshed down again and so forth. The kids couldn’t believe their eyes and neither could I. I have never seen anything in the sky move like this. I have seen many Vandenberg air force base launches, and this was not anything like a rocket launch. We hope other folks got to experience this unique air show!;35.6415898203594;-120.700931137724
Bright blue lights trailed off UFO.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.

There was a big area of white smoke between the blue light and craft. What was that? ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));35.6415898203594;-120.700931137724
Line of 10-12 UFOs proceeding in linear fashion at High Altitude. Paso Robles, CA;2021-02-13 05:15:00;4 minutes;Line of 10-12 UFOs proceeding in linear fashion at High Altitude. Paso Robles, CA I was taking a smoke break in our backyard in rural eastern Paso Robles, early in the AM very near to 5:15 - about 40 minutes ago.  Let me say at this point that this is my first DEFINITE UFO sighting. I have been vaguely interested in UFOs for their entertainment value, but I've always been darn skeptical of their existence.  I always like to look at the stars in the morning. This was impossible to miss. In the East-Southeast sky almost directly overhead, there was a long line of stars moving in a slow manner. The Line was almost perfectly linear. Their brightness was appx. that of nearly the brightest star at this time of morning.  They moved appx the same speed a satellite would, but they were clearly brighter than any satellite would appear this late in the morning.  And somehow we could tell that they were nearer to earth than a moving satellite, although their altitude seemed very high.  There was absolutely NO sound associated with them, and it was very quiet with zero traffic noise, etc.  They moved from northwest to southeast, at constant speed.  Once they got fairly near the horizon they disappeared one by one.  I believe there is no moon or very little moon today, and there was no glow from the sun in the east (too early).  I gotta say, this is my first Definite UFO sighting that can't be written off as something else.  Unless the military has craft that can fly at such extreme altitude without noticeable sound, or there are squadrons of low earth satellites being produced.  JUST INSANE !  I tried to film the line of moving objects with my wife's phone but I don't think it turned out.;35.6415898203594;-120.700931137724
