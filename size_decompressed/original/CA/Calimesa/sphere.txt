Daytime ufo observation at high altitude;2008-03-04 12:25:00;15-20 sec;Daytime ufo observation at high altitude Direction:Looking due north, altitude about 75 degrees up from horizon.  Weather: was about 75% clear with broken clouds, numerous chem trails about 70 degrees F.  Event:  I noticed a white sphere traveling to the northwest at around 50-60 thousand feet.  It traveled with a trajectory that a normal plane would have.  There was no con trail left as it traveled.  As it traveled another small white object (sphere) came/fell down verticall down from an old spread out chemtrail overhead and briefly followed the first object.  It begain to do a cork screw maneuver behind the first object then turned back up vertically, keeping it's corkscrew trajectory back up into the cloud from which it orginally came from.  The first object continued on as nothing had happened.  I waited about 10 minutes to see if anything else might happen.  None did.;33.9937;-117.0408
Red orbs over my local mountains;2012-12-30 19:00:00;1 hour;Red orbs over my local mountains This is not the first time we have seen these reddish orbs hovering over our local mountains in the inland empire.  My daughter and I saw 4 of them flying almost directly overhead in July 2010 and again on New years eve the same year.  Tonite my wife and I saw 4 of them, only difference was three of these orbs were a very bright white lite in a horizontal formation.  After watching these lights for approximately ten to fifteen minutes as they stood stationary over our local mountains 2 of them completely disappeared, one of them just kinda dimmed and one red orb appeared for about a minute or two, I asked the wife to grab my binoculars and the second she went to get them the red orb kinda did a flicker thing and disappeared as they usually do?  I have been watching the one white light that remained after the others disappeared for about an hour and I observed it dim itself 2 times.  You can clearly see that there are no houses in the area where they are and I kno! w from personal experience that they are not ranger stations.  I have seen these reddish orbs in the night sky from time to time for over a year now and have discovered that these same orbs are being seen world wide.  There must be a reason why they are often seen in my area, just wish I knew what it is!;33.9937;-117.0408
