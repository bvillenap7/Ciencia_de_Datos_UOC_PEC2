White flashing lights in patterns and a repeated sequence. Might be triabgular or rectangular.;2005-07-18 21:30:00;5 mins;White flashing lights in patterns and a repeated sequence. Might be triabgular or rectangular. I was driving E on 24 towards Walnut Creek CA (mapquest Oakland to Concord CA). At the time I saw the object I was near Lafayette (5 miles from Walnut Creek). Travelling at 70mph i first saw the object near the top of my window. I slowed down and observed the object E in line with 24. The object could have been a couple miles directly ahead of me and maybe severa thousand feet above. At first I thought it was a blimp above Mount Diablo. As I approached 680 North, the object went North in a smooth yet fast rate (100 mph). It had to be going faster than me because it went North and into the distance towards Sacramento and disapeared in the distance in a few minutes (2 minutes maybe?).  Description. The object appeards to be triangular, but since it was dark I cannot confirm. The most important features were a line of lights along the side. rectangular, long and skinny, something you may see at an arena these days. The lights were flashing in different patterns but the sequences seemed to repeate the same sequence over and over. At the top of he object I observed some small red and white lights (like on a plane). I figure the object was triangular since the small red and white lights were in the middle and above the lower set of flashing white lights.;37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
follow up to sighting in SF on 12/06/06.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising light??  PD));2005-07-18 22:00:00;5 Minutes;follow up to sighting in SF on 12/06/06 I am writing as a follow up to what I saw that (7/18/2005 Concord) night and a recent report in San Francisco 12/06/06 21:00.  I saw exactly what this guy saw.  But I have the feeling it may be a plane with a undermounted light sign.  Could somebody look into whether you can have a plane with an undermounted sign like a blimp sign.  While driving home from SF on election night I saw a plane with a light sign advertising for folks to vote for so and so   I would really like to put my mind at rest.  But his description was exactly what I saw the night of 7/18/2005 ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising light??  PD));37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
Red blinking black triangle spotted over highway 24 downtown plesant hill/ geary exit CA;2009-01-04 19:00:00;2 minutes;Red blinking black triangle spotted over highway 24 downtown plesant hill/ geary exit CA As I was driving at about 60 mph on highway 24 through downtown pleasant hill California near the geary road/best buy exit I saw two black triangular craft with bright red lights outlining their black color hovering above the freeway.  They were completely stationary.  While Visible for a half minute or so before actually driving underneath them, from a distance they looked more like bright stars, once below them however they were very detailed and were not bright like a star but had blinking red lights and triangle shape.  They did not appear to move one inch the entire 2 minutes I was looking at them from the time I approached, came up upon, and drove below the craft. The one craft was approx 2000 - 3000 Feet in the air, and further removed from being directly over the freeway.  The other one was lower 1000 â€“ 2000 feet in the air, almost directly over the freeway, and the lights were extremely bright and red on the lower one.  They were approx 300-500 yards apart from each other.  There seemed to be three (3) overly bright red lights at one of the points on the triangle, and less bright ones at the other points.  Since I was driving and only could see the bottom of the black triangle I can not describe the top obviously.  I noticed a couple other cars in front of me on the freeway swerve so they must have been looking at this too.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to take a picture while driving since this is too much of a distraction and safety risk behind the wheel however I am sort of kicking myself for not pulling to the shoulder and taking a hundred pictures with my iphone.  If I see them again I most certainly will.  This is the second time in one month that I have seen these craft in almost the exact same spot.  The previous time there was only one red blinking triangle however and it was above the freeway but on the other side.  What are these??;37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
