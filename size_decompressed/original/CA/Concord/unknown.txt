One is an extremely bright star- looking object that moves slightly  (my perspective). It is not a plane, helicopter or other familiar flying object. Always at the same time another enormous, slow- and low-flying object circles above my house and neighborhood. It is low enough to view pretty well as it has a red light that flashes quickly while it is moving. You can only tell that it is large when the light flashes, but I cannot tell the shape. It is either completely silent or makes an unusual humming noise. My landlord prefers me to smoke cigarettes outside, so I usually am in and out of my house. It is almost always between 7:00 and 8:00 pm in the evening and has gotten so close at times while I am watching it, that it scares me and I run back into my house. Sometimes there are several of the star-like things in the sky, but only one of the large objects, and only one of the star-like objects is closer than all the others. The one that appears the closest is always in the same vicinity. After reading some of these posts, I realized I am not alone in what I see.  I am a little embarrassed to ask any of my co-workers, etc. if they see what I see. I live alone. I took two pictures with my camera phone but they just look like dots.
