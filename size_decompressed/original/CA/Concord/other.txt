I saw what appeared to be a dark 4-sided object, flat in appearance, with no lights,  headed northeast, on the evening of 8/20/01.;2001-08-20 21:00:00;10 - 15 seconds;I saw what appeared to be a dark 4-sided object, flat in appearance, with no lights,  headed northeast, on the evening of 8/20/01. On this particular night which was extremely chilly, the stars were very bright and vivid. I was looking at the stars when suddenly I was aware that there was movement overhead.  In the brightest part of the sky, the night was 'black/blue' in color but within that blue/black there appeared to be an object which appeared as brown (and maybe a dingy purple/brown).  There were no lights on this object.  It appeared as a shadow within a shadow.  I wouldn't call it triangle-shaped.  It had even sides, which flared out, and the backend portion was much wider than the front end.  It appeared to be heading northeast.  At some point it became harder to locate and I turned around hoping to catch it again but in this direction the sky was much darker as this is an area in which there are fewer city lights.  I could see nothing.  In terms of distance (?)I have been asked submit a drawing to scale, using a full moon as a comparison.  For this written description, let's say that if a seed from a lemon could be my moon, then my object would be twice that size.  I have thought since then that perhaps what I saw was a Stealth bomber but it seems the backend of these jets are not one single straight edge and there is a definite nose, isn't there?  And it just seems there should have been somekind of signal (light), but then Stealth bomber facts and data is just not my thing. ((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain what the time of the event was.  We do not know what a time of 21:75 implies.  PD));37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
Chrome orbs size of a basket ball moving from 0mph to speed of ?at about 10 thousand feet up.;2002-06-06 10:45:00;5/7min;Chrome orbs size of a basket ball moving from 0mph to speed of ?at about 10 thousand feet up. On Thursday 6/6/02 at 10:45 in the morning i was working when a coworker was looking skyward i looked up and say 2 balls about the size of a basketball.they were chrome in color.as we talked i noticed that one seemed to be moving up.they seemed to be as high as you might see a passenger jet flying overhead.the secound one was dropping toward us and moving from east to west at first i thought about weather ballons but the closer it got the bottom seemed to have a transparent bottom to it.by this time they were getting further apart from each other the higher one kept moving up it was out of sight in 3 min.the secound kept getting closer it was now moving east to west faster than dropping at about 4 to 5 thousand feet it just seem to slow and stop.we are next to a small airport.it seemed to stay just outside the landing paterns of thr airport.after 5min of watching this (orb) it excellarated so fast to the west if you would have blink you would have missed it.not a cloud in the sky that morning no wind at ground level (i have perfect vison);37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
I watched the object the skys had a real quite still sense other have seen this same object but different times;2002-08-12 00:36:00;45 sec;I watched the object the skys had a real quite still sense other have seen this same object but different times 8/12/2002 our condo unit were all being fumigated and we stood at a local motel. At 12:00am I went to jack in the box and returned back to the motel .When i stepped out of my truck I heard a high hissing noisefrom the sky.I looked up and thought i was a dead man but a second more indepth calm look it wasnt a meteor had no fire it hissed by the air hitting the object and creating a bright white almost crome look.The object was coming straight down faster than what i thought possible.I started yelling for my girl friend she came out waiting for food and as soon as i turn my head back thinking it gonna crash the object made a perfect 90 degree turn and a blink of an eye it was gone no rockets no trace of what powered this my girl friend was shaking and was scared behond reason I was shaken also and still today i shake my head and try to understand a perfect 90 degree turn at maybe 3 to 5 thousand miles and hour;37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
