Ball shaped object with green glow in sky near full moon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flares, caused by photographing the Moon.  PD));2016-01-23 19:07:00;2 minutes;Ball shaped object with green glow in sky near full moon Shortly after 7 pm, Sat. Jan 23, my wife and I arrived home from the picture show.  On the way home we talked about how bright and clear the full moon is tonight. Pulled in our driveway, got out and I took these pictures of the moon.  The three pictures taken with a smart phone show a green glowing object shaped like a ball in different parts of the sky as the pictures were taken several seconds apart but from the same spot and angle towards the moon.  These are original pictures and are not photo-shopped.  The green light high in the sky near the moon is not a street lamp.  This is just weird.  What do you think it might be?  Reflection off the moon in the sky or some kind of UFO? Wife is a nurse and I'm an accountant, not professional photographer or ufoers. ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flares, caused by photographing the Moon.

UFO sighting while driving to work. silver sphere racing into the clouds.;2017-09-05 06:30:00;60 seconds;ufo sighting while driving to work. silver sphere racing into the clouds. I was driving west on Evora Rd. towards Concord, CA, when I hit some stop and go traffic. The traffic stopped for a moment, when I saw what I thought was a star, but then I noticed it was moving upward slightly.  It then moved into the clouds and never reappeared again.   I thought it might have been an airliner glinting in the morning sun, but I could not make out any wing structure.;37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
