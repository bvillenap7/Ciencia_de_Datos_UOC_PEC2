Illuminated objects moving in linear formation.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 21:05:00;25 minutes;Illuminated objects moving in linear formation On April 16 at approximately 2100 hours I took my dogs out to the backyard to relieve themselves. I was outside on the patio facing 39 degrees northeast when I saw a light in the sky moving at a high rate of speed. It was traveling from southwest to a northeasterly direction and appeared to be at a high elevation that was difficult to determine. It was followed by 6-8 other similar objects at equal distance and all in alignment. This formation was followed by several other formations heading in the same direction, but on different linear paths. In all there were about 4-5 linear formations.  Each with 4-6 objects in alignment. There were also other objects heading in the same direction but were outside of the formations and appeared to be solo or providing flank security. At the end of the large formation which consisted of all the smaller formations were a couple of more objects that appeared to be providing rear security. The last object moved overhead at a! pproximately 2125 hours. It should be noted that within the first minute and once I realized I was witnessing a phenomenon I called for my wife to come outside and she brought my adult children to observe also. While we were observing this phenomenon we also witnessed other lights in the southeast sky moving south southeast.;37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
