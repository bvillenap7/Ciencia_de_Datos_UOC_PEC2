Large round craft hovering in place with strobe lights of bright white.   Lights seemed to flash without any sequence.  Craft left so fast it was gone in a second.  Made no noise when it hovered,nor when it left.  This was seen near a closed naval weapons storage base.   Thought at first it was a helicopter.  Observer fully aware of current military aircraft.  This is not on the books, if it is ours.;37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
