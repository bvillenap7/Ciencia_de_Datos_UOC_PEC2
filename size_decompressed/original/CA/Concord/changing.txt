Location: 9 story building with glass windows with 180 degree view... Coworker alerted the rest of the workers about a black object in the sky.. Looked like black balloons tied together.. Object stayed suspended in the sky about 800 feet up. Even though it was a windy day the object stayed in one spot. At the time it seem to be morphing. It was an overcast day with high clouds moving at a good pace. The object was not effected by the wind.. I got ahold of building maintenance to gain access to the roof.. By the time we got there the object was gone.. Note: I've seen many balloons floating past this building.. If it was a bunch of balloons tied together the whole stack would have ascended, not be stationary...;37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
