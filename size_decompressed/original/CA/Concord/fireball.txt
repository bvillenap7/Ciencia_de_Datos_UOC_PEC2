Fluoresent-green short lived fireball over Concord, Ca;2000-12-20 22:00:00;1 sec;Fluoresent-green short lived fireball over Concord, Ca After doing some shopping & loading my car with bags. I hesitated for a split second to find my keys. I stood facing to the west of my center of town position and was gazing somewhat upwards into the very dark, very clear crisp night sky when the fluorecent green (gasseous like)short streak appeared at about a 45-50 degree right vertical (90 degree left-right)position. Horizontal aspect, (ground-upward/lateral field of view began at about, (ground 1, straight up 100) 55-60 on graph. It just appeared as a streak no streaming and longation of the tail Within 1 second-1 sec 1/2 made it's decent of maybe 3 if hands where outstretched ...just ended with loss of visual, no disipation. des Though it was quick and NOT very exciting....I would like to mention my 12 year old son and I have seen this same sort of short lived fireball approx. 6-8 mos back. That particular time we were on the side of town that this sighting appeared to transpire over. That night it was in our easternly field of vision. Appearing almost as a flash and close to us location, and we could have sworn it's decent ended in or between or near the top of two of four or five 10-15 story buildings. One of which is housed with major satellites on the rooftops, (major communications company). What's the big deal? If, IF Icould see the two seperate incidences back to back from both views and locations...... My thoughts & observations would most likey put the two in very tight positions of occurance with each other! Both at around the same time of night, low on the horizon, both quick, both very (seemingly)....much the same........ , OR both within a close vicinity of occurance?;37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
firball craft in sky over concord california;2003-04-04 21:30:00;3-5 minutes;firball craft in sky over concord california I was driving north east on Detroit ave, when I noticed an unusally luminated object in the sky. It was reddish orange in color, and I want to say it was dim in appearance. It had almost a natural color to it, Like that of fire. In other words it didnt appear to be luminated by artificial light. Its would slow down and change directions like nothing I know of, except a helicopter but helicopters  are loud and there was no sound coming from this thing. I pulled over and it was gone. so we drove around looking for it because we thought a building or a tree could have blocked our view, when we see it appear again almost like it appeared out of knowhere. We got out of the car and observed the object and was heading in our direction, maybe about a mile north from us. I began calling family and friends but knowone could see it. I concluded from this that the object was much closer than we thought. And coiuldnt have been much bigger than an average jet. The object began dropping some sort of luminated debris over the city. The debris looked as if it was on fire or luminated as well but it appeared to go out before it hit the ground. But it was rythmically dropping debrit for the duration of at least a minute, every two seconds. This excited me! What was it dropping???? It was actually pretty scary too!! It went passed where we were and finally faded out into the sky like a campfire would go out. This object looked almost organic. It was very bizzare;37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
Oval Shaped Firey Object Near Concord Naval Weapons Station;2003-10-04 01:00:00;10 seconds;Oval Shaped Firey Object Near Concord Naval Weapons Station I was driving South down Willow Pass Road along the Naval Weapons Station, and to the West I saw a slightly mis-shaped oval object in the sky glowing as if on fire.  It lasted for quite a few seconds (10 maybe), and from the outside in quickly faded out of visibility.  The object seemed to be hovering and not moving and was very large, though seemingly distant (If I had held my index and thumb around the edges of the object, it would have been about two inches).  I have never in my life seen anything like this.  I do not believe it was a meteor, as it did not appear to be traveling.  My only speculation is that perhaps it was an airplane on fire, but then again, I did not see smoke, nor did I hear any report of a fallen aircraft.;37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
