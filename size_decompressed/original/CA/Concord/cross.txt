It looked to be like an airplane at first as it flew overhead. I Noticed it seemed like a different light pattern than any I had seen. It had 1 light in front and 3 in back, all yellow and 2 red lights on what appeared to be the wings. As I watched it it suddenly began to slow down. Then it fully stopped in air. It sat there for about 10 seconds. Then it continued in the same direction slowly. Then suddenly without turning around it started moving quickly in the other direction. I continued watching as it sped away about the speed of a low flying leer jet except it was much quieter almost inaudible over the sound of a nearby road. Then it disappeared out of view.;37.9676380733945;-122.011463761468
