2 blue cylinders and 1 white light over Modesto;2009-10-02 22:00:00;1 hour;2 blue cylinders and 1 white light over Modesto I saw 3 objects in the sky, 2 glowing neon blue tubes (from my vantage point) and one white light with a red light on it flying around again. I captured  them on digital video. Through the binoculars the glowing blue lights looked like cylinders and the smaller white light looked liked a little flying thing with a red light on it. I really could not make out the shape.  They were a little farther away to the east than they were the other nights I saw them.  From the posts I have read, these craft are hanging around for many months.  I will try to get better video if they come back again.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
