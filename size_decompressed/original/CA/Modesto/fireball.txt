Strange lights over Modesto;2004-07-17 22:30:00;1 hour;Strange lights over Modesto At first there were a number of helicopters moving from south to north. Then two spotlights came on from the southwest. Then two blue-white streaks moved from southeast to northwest moving much faster than the typical airliner traffic seen in these skies. THEN a F-A-S-T red streak came flying overhead from southeast to northwest!!!! What the hell was this thing? The only airbase that exists up that way is Beale, and that's been out of commission for years. Still seeing some residual helo traffic. Also, some of the digital clocks (not all, curiously) in the house are blinking 12:00. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
I saw a bight blue fireball object that  jetted in front of my car and then went high in the sky.;2005-02-23 03:10:00;30 MINUTES;I saw a bight blue fireball object that  jetted in front of my car and then went high in the sky. I was driving home on a country road and just drove over railroad tracks, when a bright blue fireball came from my left and jetted in front of my windshield and went up in the sky. As I was driving to get on the freeway this object stayed in front of me and almost seemed to be watching me.  When I got on the freeway heading north I then saw 3 objects as in a formation. They were very high in the sky and I now thought maybe I was seeing stars. Very strange experience.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Fiery Orb in night sky, no tail, no sound, seemed to burn out, and looked like a oval disk.;2012-08-02 00:00:00;~5-10 minutes;Fiery Orb in night sky, no tail, no sound, seemed to burn out, and looked like a oval disk. Me and my fiance went out to have a smoke around 12:20am on August 2nd of 2012, and just as I walked outside I looked up into the sky.  I spotted this weird thing, and quickly pointed it out to my fiance because I thought my eyes were playing tricks.  But no, he saw it too.  It was this, almost orb of fire hovering across the sky. My fiance almost thought it looked like someone had shot a flare up into the sky, but it just flew in a straight line, no trail behind it.  It was going about as fast as a plane does when you see them in the sky, but it was a lot closer than a plane.  Almost maybe as high up as a 80 story building. I'm just guesstimating here.  But it was moving at a decent speed, but slow enough to follow for a few minutes. Both me and my fiance caught it on our camera phones.  My camera wasn't to good on the quality, but I'm still going to try and upload it somewhere.  The orb was like a fire color, a little orange, some red, and a little white at the edge.  The camera didn't pick it up that way though.  Me and him followed it for as long as possible, which about a few minutes, before the flame look went away and all we were able to see was a dark grey disk fade behind the tree's.  There was no sound to the strange thing, not like a plane would give off, no crash sound later on from like a meteor, no tail on the thing trailing behind it, just a fiery orb floating across the sky. I had posted the story on my Facebook, onto my paranormal web site, to see if anyone could help to identify it. And then someone sent me a link to this site.  I noticed some others were having similar experiences as us.  All I know is when the craft disappeared, I had the strangest gut feeling that we were not meant to witness that.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Moderately large orange spheres dissapearing into the vast space.;2012-09-28 22:34:00;15 minutes;moderately large orange spheres dissapearing into the vast space. I walked outside into my street to grab something from car and looked into the sky i saw a huge orange fireball looking thing moving back and forth somewhat fast it would stop and hover until it dimmed. about 2 seconds later a second one appeared and hovered near where the old one dissengrated into the darkness this one continued with the same actions and dissapeared fairly slower then the first. At this time my neighbors had been pulling up and asked if we figured out what they were and stated there was a line of over 20 of them. this was not seen by me or my aquantences but by my neighbor and his teenage daughter.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
