Strange Bright Green Light moving through sky near Modesto CA at 2:25 am... visible from I-5 on the left horizon. Very nearby;2005-10-16 02:25:00;5 seconds;Strange Bright Green Light moving through sky near Modesto CA at 2:25 am... visible from I-5 on the left horizon. Very nearby My fiance and I were returning to Salem, OR. from a vacation we took in Los Angeles, CA.   Driving N. on Interstate 5 we neared Modesto at approximately 2:25 am and it was very cloudy and had just got done raining.  My fiance was sleeping on the passengers side when a neon green light shot from the clouds nearly straight down on the left and fell behind the hills.  It was about the size of a silver dollar from my perspective.  It traveled slower than a shooting star typicaly would.  When I returned home I got onto yahoo and typed in Green Light Modesto 2: am 2005 and got a hit from this site stating this has been seen before in the same area and at the same time.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Oval object advancing towards me;2010-03-28 21:30:00;A little over 6 minutes;Oval object advancing towards me I was about to go to sleep early(I do this once a week) and i got on my bed and laid there because my body gets hot.I always stare at the moon for a minute and wonder about things.I saw a weird figure that was nearly camoflagued with the dark sky though emitted a light blue light on the other side of it.It had an oval outline and i saw it getting bigger.I assumed my eyes were adjusting on it but actually did a few seconds later when i notice it was getting closer.I sometimes see planes flying over the sky but they always have a regular red flashing light on them. I live in a house with a large backyard and porch.I immediately got up and get my camera and go outside since it was comming closer and closer i could get a good snapshot of it.I took about 5 shots of it until my camera started having electrical spark sounds and suddenly died.My neighbor next door to the right had a dog and it was barking fiercly at the object and i heard my neighbor come out to his backyard.I told him a strange object was in the sky.We watched it slowly advance towards us until my neighbor's dog gave a final large bark at it and the sky sorta opened up and the object went in and disappeared in a flash of green glow.
