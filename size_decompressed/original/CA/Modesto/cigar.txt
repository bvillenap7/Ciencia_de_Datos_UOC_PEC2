Two crafts spotted over Westfield shopping cntr. Modesto;2009-08-26 21:30:00;45 Min.;Two crafts spotted over Westfield shopping cntr. Modesto 2 crafts 1 with bright lights across could be cigar or saucer shaped. Other was cigar shaped deep bright neon blue glowing. It would glow and then fade out and come back.  The other one hovered up and down quit a bit and side to side like having engine trouble. The blue cigar one stayed close as if to make sure the other was ok. A police or military white I think with markings plain stayed close by flying between them. Then they faded out. The hight I would say would be about 15 to 20 stories up in the sky.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
