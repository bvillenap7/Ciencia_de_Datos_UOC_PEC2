Bright teardrop shaped obj. moving across the night sky with  glowing light trailing.((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:15:00;10 minutes;Modesto, CA. bright teardrop shaped object moving across the night sky with large glowing light trailing and no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD)) I was outside, looked up saw soft looking cotton/fuzzy textured glow of white light that looked like an upside down cone.  At the tip the light was very long and slender.  This connected to one bright teardrop shaped object that was a very bright white light. I thought that it may have been a plane flying through an overcast sky and disturbing moisture or a police chopper with their search light on and looking for something.  The the light glow was not that bright and did not touch the ground.  I ran for my camera and the light was gone.  Then in the distance I saw the point of light, the teardrop shape.  I ran and got my binoculars and could see the tear dropped shape brightly glowing.  It would repeatedly go bright and dim.  There was no sound, noted that the stars are bright, no noticeable haze or clouds a passenger jet was clearly seen moving toward San Francisco airport. The object was not climbing but moving forward and only white. Weird.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
