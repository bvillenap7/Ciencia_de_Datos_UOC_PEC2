Red blinking lights darting and surging high in the night sky;2004-07-19 21:15:00;approx 15 minutes;Red blinking lights darting and surging high in the night sky While on the second story balcony of my townhouse, I noticed red blinking lights very high in the western sky. They darted sideways and diagionally in a seemly random pattern staying within the same general area of the sky. Occasionaly they would surge (sometimes two consecutive surges) extremely fast in a direction, leaving a briefly visible trail of light. When an aircraft flying north to south approached and flew past the area of the lights (but at a lower altitude),the red lights moved into the Western horizon and eventually disappeared from my vision behind a tree (at approximatley 9:30pm).;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

Bright light in Modesto, CA sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2009-04-19 22:30:00;15 minutes;Bright light in Modesto, CA sky. Modesto, CA Sunday April 19, 2009 Approx. 10:30 PM I reside on the Eastern portion of the city and I observed a stationary bright light in the night sky to the WSW. The light appeared to be shifting colors slightly from white light to very slow flashes of very faint red. It was located somewhat low on the horizon at about a 30-35 degree angle.  It was not a hovering helicopter, as I heard no noise and it was completely stationary, with no bobbing or shifting of its position whatsoever. I have never seen a light like this at that specific location. I observed this object for a period of 15 minutes or so. It did not move its position in the sky the entire viewing, I thought it was one of the observable planets, but did not know which one. It certainly looked like a planet. Then suddenly it simply vanished. There was a tree off to the right of my immediate visual area that I was marking its location by, so it was not a matter of losing sight amongst the stars in the sky. It was suddenly not where it was upon my earlier observations. A very strange sighting and I cannot explain it. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect??

3 unidentified aircraft over Modesto, CA;2009-08-27 21:00:00;15-20 minutes;3 unidentified aircraft over Modesto, CA August 27, 2009 9:00pm PCT  I was riding my bike tonight and observed what appeared to be two aircraft of some kind at about 1000 ft. above our neighborhood. There were about 10 people in the street watching. The highest craft had two bright white lights on it, and the craft appeared to be hovering, then moving a few feet, and then hovering again. Beneath this craft was a second craft that had two very bright neon-blue lights. It made wide circles about 100 feet under the other craft. Both craft made small changes in altitude and direction, but generally stayed in the area above our neighborhood for about 15-20 minutes or so. A third craft (with blinking red and white lights on it) started to close on the higher craft, and this one looked more like a conventional aircraft. At one point it flew between the two craft (below the higher one and above the lower one). At that point the lower one (with the bright neon-blue lights on it) began flying in a fast semi-vertical circular pattern. The third craft continued on, and eventually the higher-flying craft began to fly away in a northwestern direction. I ran to my house and got my camera, but by then they were all gone.  I checked, and no else had a camera to take any photos. I called the Modesto Police Dept. to see if anyone else had reported seeing the lights.  I was told that someone else had called in, but no record was made of the call.  Nor were they interested in making one of my call.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

A bright white light that looked like an asterisk flew high in the sky in an arc, then dimmed to a red dot before disappearing.;2011-06-29 22:15:00;About 5 minutes;A bright white light that looked like an asterisk flew high in the sky in an arc, then dimmed to a red dot before disappearing. My boyfriend and I were out smoking a cigarette and looking at the stars to pass the time. I noticed something that looked like it could have been a star or a planet begin to move slowly across the sky.  I pointed it out to him and we watched it slowly move in a strange arc across the sky.  It was a brilliant white light that was so bright, it had a starburst effect, making it look like an asterisk.  It moved well across the sky for no longer than five minutes.  Suddenly, the light dimmed quickly to a tiny red dot, and then it disappeared. I am a college student, my boyfriend is a labor worker, and we have an infant.  We've never seen anything like this before.  We could see planes in the sky that night - they were much, much lower than this light.

Yellow-orange light seen approaching Modesto, CA.;2015-09-18 21:10:00;18-19 minutes;Yellow-orange light seen approaching Modesto, CA At a few minutes after 2100 PDT, 09/18/15, I was talking on my cellphone (with a hands-free device) with a friend just a moment after my wife and I had stopped at a restaurant (approximately 4 NM from MOD airport) for a late-night hamburger as I walked around the back of the car, walking south to east, I stopped to open the car door for my wife to get out of the car and noticed a very bright light NE of the town heading in our direction.  The distance of the light from town was initially difficult to judge, not knowing precisely what sort of craft the light was part of, but judging by the rate of its approach and estimated altitude, I am guessing that I first noticed the light 30-40 miles NE of our location and possibly at 14,000'-17,000' (very difficult to judge with any precision).   Weather at the time: no clouds were visible the brighter stars in constellations were all visible from horizon to horizon, so I'm assuming that the weather was CAVU.  There is absolutely no possibility that this light was a planet, for Venus had set sometime earlier in the west, and the light was much too large to be Mars, Saturn, or Jupiter.  (I served as a volunteer amateur astronomer at a nearby observatory in Oakland, and can assure the reader that whatever the light was, it was not a planet, star, or satellite.)  I've flown for a intra-state airline out of Modesto for 7 years and have lived in the city NE of MOD airport for 28 years the path of the bright light didn't match that of aircraft flying from Sacramento southbound along low-altitude airways it didn't match air traffic flying the typical arrivals into KSFO or KOAK, where the traffic crosses the Modesto VOR at 10,000' MSL and flies outbound on a WSW radial before being vectored by Bay Approach for arrivals at KSFO or KOAK the light did not appear to be heading to MOD airport or distant KSJC I thought that the light might be traffic heading for MOD VOR, but the heading wasn't quite correct (it would pass west of the VOR on the observed heading), so it didn't appear that it was on the Modesto arrival for KSFO or traffic bound for MOD.  Judging by its size the speed of its approach angle of approach and vertical relative motion, I believe that the light was descending.  The closer that the light came, the more impressed I was by its apparent size it was yellow-orange in color, which may have been caused by smoke from fires that had burned in the vicinity of Modesto in September, but which I seriously doubt is the case as the color had not changed to any real degree in its approach to Modesto since the time when I first observed it some 9-10 minutes before.  During this time, I didn't see any change in relative motion that might have indicated that an aircraft had leveled off.  When the light appeared to have more lateral relative motion, I looked very carefully for red and green navigation lights and white (wingtip) or red (tail, or fuselage) anti-collision strobe lights and observed none [I can almost always see the anti-collision strobe lights on commercial jets at 10,000' on the Modesto arrival -- procedures dictate that arriving flights cross the MOD VOR at 10,000' and in clear weather, I can usually detect the red, green, and white position lights of traffic overhead, though not the color with the jet being at that altitude (my vision is 20/10 or better in both eyes)].  As neither my wife (also a pilot) or I could not see any position (navigation) lights, after removing the earbuds of my cellphone's hands-free device from my ears, I listened for powerplant noise and could not detect any sound of a reciprocating engine propellor-driven aircraft, no jet engine powerplant(s) nor could I hear the blade noise from a helicopter (our home is less than 3 nautical miles E of a hospital that has EMS helicopter service, or, that of the helicopter that serves another hospital approximately 4 miles WSW of us).  Puzzled by the size of the light (at this point, much larger than any I've seen on private civil, commercial, and military aircraft) and the lack of both navigation lights and powerplant noise, I ducked into the backseat of our car to pull my professional Canon EOS 5D Mark III DSLR camera from its bag, turned the camera on, removed the lens cover (about 7-8 seconds at most), only to find that no aircraft or lights were visible whatsoever.  Usua! lly, if police or hospital helicopters are flying away from me, I can see at least one position position and two or more strobe anti-collision lights of aircraft that have over-flown my zenith -- and usually, there is just enough dust or haze in the air that a landing light will display an apparent beam down to the ground which can be seen from all over the city.  (The street that our restaurant is on is Oakdale Road, which points directly at the midfield of the MOD airport to the south of us: any aircraft landing at Modesto airport should havqe clearly been visible for several minutes more.)  I scanned the sky east through northwest several times and could find absolutely no lights in the sky except those heading to or away from the MOD VOR at an altitude of approximately 10,000' MSL the strobe lights of commercial jets on Jet-One (J-1) at high altitude heading southbound or transiting the skies far to the far south, apparently jet traffic heading into KSJC.  No lights could be seen flying left- or right-traffic in the traffic pattern for landing at MOD airport or going in to either of the two local hospitals.  The light had apparently and simply disappeared.  Any aircraft going into MOD or the two hospitals should have been visible another 2-4 minutes if landing at the airport or 1-2 minutes if landing at one of the two hospitals.  Even looking through my camera's zoom lens, I should have been able to see at least some of the usual lights aircraft display, but saw nothing.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

I went outside at 5:20 AM. It was a dark sky. I immediately noticed 2 bright stationary star-like white lights (brighter than any other star or planet then visible) at about 10 degrees west of straight up or at an altitude angle of 80 degrees from the Western horizon. The lights were aligned in North and South direction and were spaced about 4 to 6 diameters of the moon (2 to 3 degrees) apart. The moon was quarter crescent.  They then faded out beyond visibility within about 15 seconds at the same time as if there were coordinated.  I thought I should report this because it is the second time I have noticed this same type of event.  About a year ago in the Spring I saw the same thing happen with a pair of star-like white lights in the evening about 8:30 PM at an altitude angle of about 45 degrees above the North horizon. Those lights were spaced about the same and were aligned East West.  Maybe these were both satellites but they must have been in high orbit because they did not move perceptively.
