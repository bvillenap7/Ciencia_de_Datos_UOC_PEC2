Two  luminescent spherical ufo's  in flight pattern over Modesto, CA.;2003-10-18 16:10:00;8 minutes;Two  luminescent spherical ufo's  in flight pattern over Modesto, CA. I was working on the sunroom addition to our house and I was looking upwards at the top plate of the frame to see if it was level. In the sky, in my line of sight, I saw a bright spherical shapped object which was moving slowly to the SW. The ufo moved from straight above my position to a point about 35 degrees above the SW horizon, where it stopped. It remained stationary for about 30 seconds, then it began to move slowly towards the NW. As this ufo moved back towards my position, I noticed a second ufo of the same shape, size, and color and traveling on the same trajectory as the first ufo. The first ufo was beginning to dim as it moved to the NW. The ufo on the SW course remained bright. The two ufo's passed each other moving in opposite directions. As I was looking at the second ufo, I lost track of the first one. The second ufo also stopped in the same manner as the first, and then it also proceeded on a NW track. As the second ufo traveled NW, it too began to fade as though it were gaining altitude. I watched this ufo until it finally faded out. Both of these ufo's traveled on an identical triangular path in the sky,stopping at the same position, and turning to travel in the opposite transverse direction. The movement was very perfect, as though a designated flight pattern had been precalculated.  The entire sighting lasted for about 8 minutes.  Also, both ufo's had a soft, yet intense white luminescense. And both ufo's were initially bright, and it was 4:30 in the afternoon, in bright sunlight on a partly cloudy day.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

From about 1:30am to 5:00am it gets brighter (closer) when the sun comes up it dissapears. I filmed it for 10 minutes, I have incredible footage of a jelly fish like appearance (transparent) with electricity running through it. It seems as though it is breathing (expanding and contracting). It is out tonight! ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Orange translucent sphere's traveling at high speed just below the clouds in the direction of 135 degrees SE.;2005-06-17 23:00:00;10 seconds;Orange translucent sphere's traveling at high speed just below the clouds in the direction of 135 degrees SE. Sitting outside in a chair on my pateo, I was gazing up at the sky. I was on the tail end of a cloudy sky (above me and to the East were clouds, a clear sky coming in from the west).  Directly over my head, I saw a sphere moving under the clouds horizontal to the earth. The sphere was a translucent orange. I stood up immediately wondering what it was. My first thought was that some kid must have lost a balloon, but soon realized the object was traveling far too fast and in a strait line. I later determined with a compass it was traveling in the direction of 135 degrees SE. I watched it until it faded out of site on the far side of the horizon which took only a few seconds. I could see other planes in the sky at various altitudes. All were much slower than the sphere. It must have been traveling at a very high rate of speed.  I stood out there on the patio trying to figure out what I had just witnessed and continued gazing up in the sky (this time looking for orange'ish spheres). About 5 minutes after the first sphere, a 2nd sphere was spotted. This sphere was not directing overhead, but a distance to my East (maybe a mile). It also was traveling in the same direction as the first sphere and at the same apparent speed (same color). There was no sound at all.  I continued looking up in the sky for the next hour, but no other sphere was seen. This is the first time I've ever witnessed anything like this. Wouldn't believe it if I had not seen it for myself.  These sphere's were definately not man-made. They were almost like an orange plasma ball of some type, except they traveled at a high rate of speed as though they had a distination.  I'm still trying to figure out what they might have been. I have no clue.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Multiple Spheres dancing in the sky over Modesto, California;2007-03-26 12:30:00;2 minutes;Multiple Spheres dancing in the sky over Modesto, California I have always been a UFO skeptic, yet, at the same time,all of my life I have always wanted to see something for myself in order to beleive.  Today, I finally realized that what I have always wanted to beleive is actually true.  My experience is plain and simple.  I was visiting my sister in Modesto, California.  My neices kept bugging me to take them out to the back yard where they have a swing set.  As I walked out, I saw to jets going by to the Northwest skies above the city.  I normally dont stop and stare at passing planes or jets, but this time I did.  As I saw these to jets criss cross each other at different altitudes of course, I stared at the contrails they left behind, when suddenly, to my amazement and out of nowhere, in the vicinity of approximately where these jets were going by, I focused my vision as best i could to this area of the sky because I noticed something strange.  At first, I thought it may have been some high flying birds but to my incredible amazement, I stared and focused my eyes as much as I could and clearly what my eyes saw was without mistake 5 spherical objects doing some kind of what I will call a dance in the sky.  These objects seemed grey in color and at times seemed to have a metalic shine to them.  They moved in a strange pattern, one in which I don have the words to explain. As I stared at the objects, without removing my eyes off of them, I yelled at my neice to call my sister, at the time, my sister had a call and was not able to get to where I was on time.  By the time she did step out to see what I was yelling about, just as suddenly as these spheres(for lack of better terms) appeared, they dissappeared from the sky.  I dont know what else to say or to write, but now, finally, I can relate to the thousands of people who see strange things in the sky, yet feel so alone with their experience, that they rather just keep it to themselves and go on with life as if nothing happened.  I stand before my God, who is my only witness of what I experience! d today, that what i have written here is the truth.  I dont know whats going on, or why, but something is going on in the skies above us.  We need to pay more attention to the sky, thats a lesson I learned today.  This is what I experienced today, and its funny, but its really all I have to say and share with all of you.  Thanks for providing me the opportunity to share my sighting with the rest of the world.  God Bless.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

Several glowing red orbs seen flying overhead from the west to the east the night of July 4th in Modesto, California.;2013-07-04 21:30:00;15 minutes;Several glowing red orbs seen flying overhead from the west to the east the night of July 4th in Modesto, California. I live in Modesto, California.  At about 9:30 p.m. July 4th, 2013 myself and six other people witnessed glowing orbs flying overhead from west to east. There were six groups of them flying by that I witnessed. The first group were three orbs, glowing red. They seemed to flicker. There was no sound. They looked pretty low, I would guess maybe only a few hundred feet above. They were moving fast, way faster than the 10 mile an hour winds the weather report says for our area. As they moved closer to the east they seemed to fade but you could still make them out, we watched until they went too far to make out with the naked eye. The second group was another three orbs. The third group was three orbs as well. The fourth group was two orbs. The fifth group was two orbs. The sixth and final was a single orb. These all followed the same path, from west to east. They all moved about the same speed, although in the first group, one was moving out ahead of the others at a faster speed. We are all dumbfounded as to what this could have been. There was no sound. They were moving very fast. This event lasted about 15-20 minutes. I have witnessed lots of balloons, lanterns, remote planes, toy rockets, flares, fireworks, etc. and I can definitely state that this was not that. The only thing that might even remotely explain this would be some type of lantern, like the Chinese floating lanterns. But that doesn’t explain the speed at which they moved or the exact path they took across the sky. I can definitely say that this is the most eventful 4th of July I have ever had!;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

UFO cluster imaged from ISS.;2020-04-13 22:14:00;1 minute;UFO cluster imaged from ISS I took several images from the international space station external HD camera ( EHDC ) of luminous sphere shaped objects.  The ISS was located over the southern tip of South America so I believe that the UFOs are close to the Antartica Peninsula.  I have these images posted at my web site mysteryportals.com  It was past midnight in that region.  One photo shows the objects in a spiraling formation which is fascinating.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
