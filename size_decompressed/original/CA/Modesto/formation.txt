Three luminous disks trail a jetliner;1999-09-10 12:35:00;15 seconds;Three luminous disks trail a jetliner I was walking into the toys r' us store on Sisk Rd. I looked up and saw three circular white lighted disks flying in a triangular formation following behind a low flying jetliner. One disk was in the lead and two followed behind, one on each side to form a perfect triangle. The objects trailed behind the jetliner for about ten seconds, then they stopped and there was a flash of light where they had been. The objects seemed to disappear straight upwards.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
These aircraft were not running any FAA required flight gear!;2000-10-21 21:15:00;45 seconds;These aircraft were not running any FAA required flight gear! We witnessed what appeared to be four aircraft flying side by side in formation across the sky from south to north over our home in Modesto, California. They each had a reddish-orange light, but not like other aircraft flying in the area with flashing and running lights. They covered the area from horizon to horizon very quickly and then suddenly changed formation so as to be traveling in line one after the other and then abruptly took off in four different directions at an extreme rate of speed. We could not see much as far as a description of the aircraft, however their manuevering was unlike anything we are used to seeing in this area which is heavily travelled by commercial aircraft. They also seemed to be at a very high altitude, much higher than other aircraft in the area. And the aircraft seemed to be very large.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
10-12 white/shiny objects in changing formations over Modesto, CA;2008-11-30 13:30:00;1 min;10-12 white/shiny objects in changing formations over Modesto, CA My wife, step-son and I were working in the backyard when I began to watch a helicopter fly from east to west just north of our location.  As the helicopter flew past I noticed what I thought was a large swept-wing aircraft flying south to north. It was much further away than the helo, at a much higher altitude. It was also moving south to north. As I began to concentrate on it, it became clear it was not a single aircraft. It was a formation of maybe ten to twelve white or shiny objects. The edges of the objects were not clearly defined,but appeared to be round or oval in shape. As the formation moved to the north it began to change shapes. The objects would form a line and then transition to a circular formation and back to a v-type formation. I thought maybe it was a flock of birds, but based on the perceived distance from my location(maybe one mile), they were moving too fast. The formation began to move in slightly different directions, even stopping at one point.  The changes of direction were not drastic, but certainly enough for me to notice. The objects moved in a very mechanical fashion in that the movements were smooth yet deliberate (if that makes sense). Weather conditions were clear and sunny except for some faint remnants of morning fog.  I eventually lost sight of the formation in a low-lying cloud north of my home.  I tried to point out the formation to my wife, but she could not see it.  My sixteen year old step-son saw it and referred to it as a silver line, but he did not say anything until I mentioned it. I am a nearly twelve year law enforcement officer and I've seen some strange things over the years, but nothing that struck me like this.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
3 brightly lit formation in the sky in Central California;2009-09-13 20:00:00;2 min;3 brightly lit formation in the sky in Central California Driving on mchenry ave near penlendale ave.. I saw a formation, all had white lights, except two which had a bright green light and seemed to be the leader or mover of pack, moving in ways a regular plane would not move.  The third craft had a bright blue light and white lights emitting from it. I pulled over and watched it for two mins or more. Then a regular plane flew by, while this was going on, so I knew this could not be a regular aircraft. The sky was over-cast, and other people driving by could see it also.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
This was definitely not from this earth I’ve never seen one before ever;2021-02-18 05:25:00;5 minutes;This was definitely not from this earth I’ve never seen one before ever At 5:25 AM Pacific time. I was taking out the trash and I saw something moving across the sky at a high rate of speed and the sky was perfectly clear I saw a big dippers I saw ordinary planes going around in the sky but this one was no plane it was moving so fast it was unbelievable to see a large cluster of white stars shot across the sky from north to East going at a high rate of speed faster than a plane would ever go there was at least 15 to 20 moving across the sky. They were not physically aligned they were all in different shades moving across the sky happened so fast by the time you pointed at them they were already across the sky headed east.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
