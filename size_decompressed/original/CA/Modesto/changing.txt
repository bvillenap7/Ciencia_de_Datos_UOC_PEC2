UFO 's video taped over Modesto, California on Oct. 19th 2003 , showing bright starlike objects;2003-10-19 02:45:00;2 hours;UFO 's video taped over Modesto, California on Oct. 19th 2003 , showing bright starlike objects I reported these same ufo's yesterday and they were back today. I was working building a sunroom onto our house and as I looked up to see if the upper frame was level I saw a ufo coming from the north. It was bright, starlike, and it made a loop around the house and hovered above me for about five minutes. I went into the house and got binoculars and looked at it. In the binoculars it seemed to change shape, from a sphere to a elongated figure. My daughter came out of the house and I showed her the ufo. She was surprised to see a bright star in the middle of the day. I gave her the binoculars and she also commented that it was changing shapes. This ufo gradually grew dim and we went into the house to eat lunch. After lunch, I decided to get the video camera out with me in case the ufo returned. I went back to work and as I was coming out of the garage with some wood I had cut, I saw three ufo's coming from the north. I quickly grabbed the video camera and recorded the ufo's as they traveled above the house. These ufo's were bright and closer , and are the ones in the video. They were also spherical in shape, and traveled in unison. I also got another shot of a ufo moving above the tree, but this is shorter. Most of the video I took that day did not turn out. I am hoping that these tapes will be examined by experts to determine more about this .;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

Blue UFO in North Modesto, Ca.;2010-02-09 21:00:00;15 min;Blue UFO in North Modesto, CA. I was driving down north on a busy street when I saw a bright blue object gently moving side to side.  I pulled over into a parking lot and took several pics with my cell phone camera.  It would get brighter then dim sometimes to nothing.  It would come back and gently sway side to side.  Then it headed north and I followed it.   It stopped about mile up the road and I pulled over again.  It just hovered below the clouds and genlty swayed.  After several more minutes I watched vanish into thin air.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
3 red lights in triangle shape change shape and fade away;2013-01-01 00:04:00;3 minutes;3 red lights in triangle shape change shape and fade away At 12:04 am I was standing on my balcony facing North, listening to the New Years celebrations.  I noticed in the distance three red lights.  I initially assumed they were from fireworks or a nearby cell phone tower.   The lights were in a triangular shape, but appeared to be rotating counter-clockwise and backwards.  The rotation made the triangle change its shape.  The lights moved in a very fluid way.  They were bright but at the same time appeared dim enough to possibly look like nearby stars.   At 12:06 am two of the three lights faded away.  The last light remained until 12:07 until it also faded away.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
