However, there were no aircraft lights, and there was absolutley NO SOUND coming from it. I could tell it was not at an extreme altitude, as its wings and fuselage were highlighted by the ground light around us.  It was moving at a speed equivalent to a jet fighter, but again there was no sound at all.  Almost simultaneously, we all said to each other, what is that?.  It then DISAPPEARED!  I couldn't belive what I just saw, and my two friends said they saw it disappear as well.  We watched for a while longer, but it did not reappear.  At no point did we hear any jet sound.  It was shaped like a Y. I have never witnessed a UFO, but I think this is most likely a top-secret, very advanced military aircraft.  Incidentally, there were a few distant aircraft in the westward sky, with normal identifying aircraft lights, but no were close to or seemed to be following this aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request more information from the witness.  We would like to rule out the possibility that the object might have been a satellite.  PD));37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Boomerang shaped object in central California;2005-01-11 21:10:00;30 seconds;Boomerang shaped object in central California Sitting in the spa under a cloudless cold night. I love to watch the winter stars and the high-altitude jetliners as they move across the night sky. The stars move slowly from east to west, and here the jetliners move swiftly from east to west as they make their way to the bay area airports. My wife went to bed early so I decided to soak in the spa for awhile (one beer when I got home and a single glass of wine with dinner). Facing due south in the spa a boomerang shaped, translucent object entered my field of vision (from behind and to the right) moving from NW to SE. Lack of visual reference cues makes this thing impossible to size, but it moved like a big object and the reflection of the street and city lights glowed dimly off the curved bottom surface at a seemingly moderate height, well below the airliner traffic. It made no sound and really seemed to be more a boomerang shaped disturbance in the air rather than a visible object. Speed was impossible to judge, except to say that it took 20 to 25 seconds to traverse my field of vision. I jumped up and stood in the spa to view as much of this thing as possible while it disappeared behind the houses across the street. This is the first clear and cloudless night in central California after many days of rain. Could the Airforce be out and about with some new toys?

5 white lights arranged in chevron pattern, silent;2005-01-30 23:12:00;5 -10 secs;5 white lights arranged in chevron pattern, silent After I (along with two others) witnessed a strange, silent Y or chevron-shaped aircraft two nights ago, I decided to stand out again on my back porch at around the same time of night, curious to see if it would appear again. At around 11:12 pm, I was facing westward, when I noticed 5 relatively dim white lights, arranged in a chevron pattern, over my left shoulder.  It was travelling from a southeast to northwest direction.  This time, I was not able to discern the outline of an associated fuselage.  There were no starboard, port, or flashing running lights, as would be expected of a normal airplane.  I estimate the altitude at around 1000 feet or less, and the speed was about what you would expect from a private jet.  I would say the size was that of a B-2 bomber.  However, it was completely silent.  It had a straight flight path, and a constant speed. Having lived in the area for some time, I know the normal flight patterns and altitude of commercial aircraft on approach to the Bay area, and small private aircraft from nearby smaller airports. This definitely did not fit the appearance of either. Now that I've witnessed this a second time, I believe it must be some type of advanced military aircraft.  I'm going to try to get a picture of it tomorrow night, if on the off chance it appears again.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Chevron style with dim light blue lights.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-15 00:05:00;15 seconds;Chevron style with dim light blue lights. Was outside smoking.  Very dim light blue lights (angled) on 2 sides were observed.  Craft was not more than 3000 to 5000 foot elevation and ran totally silent.  Speed about 200 to 250 mph.  Moved from east to west.  Would love to take a ride. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Shooting start transitioned into a black boomerang shaped craft.;2020-10-22 20:30:00;00:10;Shooting start transitioned into a black boomerang shaped craft. My girlfriend and I were in our backyard around 8:30pm and 9pm star-gazing when we noticed what we thought was a shooting star. As it started moving overhead it then transitioned into a black boomerang shaped craft.  The craft was silent moving from West to East. It seemed to blend with the night sky yet at the same time repel it's surroundings. The only way we can describe it is that it was pushing through the sky. We could see some type of 'aura' or some kind of 'field' emanating off of the craft.  The entire sighting lasted about 10 seconds.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
