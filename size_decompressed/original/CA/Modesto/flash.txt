I saw a circle of white clusters of light and radiating spikes of light spreading out from the center.;2012-01-15 18:00:00;ongoing, 2 nights;I saw a circle of white clusters of light and radiating spikes of light spreading out from the center. Sunday, 01-15-2012 Modesto, CA 95350  I stepped outside taking some fresh air around 1800 hours, and looking off to my west-southwest was an object, not moving, but flashing occasionally with a white, blue-white, greenish flash of light around the object. It looked to me like an electrical discharge of some kind. I then looked around the sky to see if there where any other stars or lights from aircraft. Looking directly up, I saw what appeared to me as the twin of the object to my west. The object had radiating spikes of light like a corona, but the “spikes of light” did not move. I called my friend and ask her if see could see anything in the night sky that seemed strange. She saw the same thing I was witnessing, so I went to get an old SLR with a telephoto lens and a doubler to see if we could make out any more detail. With magnification, the object seemed to have a rectangle in the center of a circle with smaller rectangles on each side of the larger rectangle in the middle. I didn’t get any pictures as the old camera with the long lenses had no film in it. After watching these objects for about 15 minutes, I went next door to see if my neighbor had seen them,or take him outside to see if he saw what we saw. He said he saw the same objects the night sky the night before in the same spots in the sky. From my best guess these objects must have been very large. The time right now is 1915 hours, 12-15-2012,and the object that was in the west is gone, and the object directly overhead has moved a few degrees closer toward to west and very visible even through an overcast sky. Thank you. I hope there may be other reports of this same sighting, whatever it is.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Stationary blinking white light.;2013-10-30 21:30:00;~1 minute;Stationary blinking white light Approximate date of sighting 10/29 or 10/30, approximate time 9-10 pm. I was outside in my backyard briefly letting the dog out, and looked up at the night sky, as I frequently do on a clear night.  Within my peripheral vision, I caught a rather bright flash (approximate astronomical magnitude -5) of white light of less than 1 second duration.  I would estimate the size of the light to be slightly larger than the planet Venus, and was noted at the straight overhead position, 90 degrees above the horizon.  This white blinking light reoccured several times, at an interval of ~10-15 seconds, and for a total duration of less than 1 minute.  It then abruptly stopped.  The blinking light remained in the exact same position throughout that time.  My impression is that it had an altitude of at least 20,000 feet, but possibly greater.  No associated object/fuselage could be observed.  I would say that it had a very similar appearance to a bright, blinking white beacon light that one would observe atop a radio transmitter tower.  It was definitely not an aircraft navigational light. I am an experienced observer of the night sky.  I am familiar with the commercial aircraft on their approach pattern to SFO (that path is due south of my location), and all the visible planets and 1st magnitude stars.  This was also not the ISS, a satellite, meteor, nor an iridium flare.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
