Very bright diamond shaped flying object that got dimmer and faded away.;2011-06-29 22:19:00;8 seconds;Very bright diamond shaped flying object that got dimmer and faded away. I had just reached home after going to the dog park.  I opened the door that leads to the backyard to let my dog out, and stepped out too.  It was dark and i looked up at the sky, i saw a very very very very very bright diamond shaped flying object in the sky,  I thought it was an airplane but then i realized it wasn't blinking and it was way too bright and oddly shaped to be one.  I rubbed my eyes and closed each eye to see if it was still there after.  It wasn't exactly flying in a straight line.  It was flying in a slightly curved u shape.   And then as it got closer to a star in the sky it started fading away till it disappeared.  I had called my mum during this but as usual she took her own sweet time to come outside, but she did stop me from stepping backward into the pool.  She unfortunately missed what i saw and instead thought i was looking up into my bedroom window .;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Bright red Diamond shaped object and fog ball object;2012-10-14 02:46:00;2 minutes;Bright red Diamond shaped object and fog ball object I was outside at about 2:40am and I saw a diamond shaped bright red light just under the little dipper it got brighter and then shrank to the size of a pin point then was gone, this lasted about 2 minutes.   Then a few minutes later there was what I can only describe as a fog ball appeared in a different part of the sky slowly floating lik a kids bubble down towards earth.  It was going in the direction of Patterson Ca.  I do not know what this was nor do I have any pictures.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Saw a yellow orange circular object not too far up in the sky and it began to streak downward like a falling star or meteor.;2015-08-04 23:00:00;5 minutes;Saw a yellow orange circular object, not too far up in the sky, and it began to streak downward like a falling star or meteor.  My first thought was that it was really close to the ground, if it doesn't burn out before it hits, but it was not moving fast like a falling star, it slowed its descent and took the shape of a diamond fireball.   It was sparkling like a Fourth of July sparkler.  Light yellow, orange and white in color.  It was coming towards me and was very bright and close and then lowered over a backyard of a neighboring yard a few houses down from my backyard and houvered there for what seemed like forever.  I was scared thinking it might be a hobby drone with lights and camera looking in people's back yards.   I finally decided to go in and grab my phone so I could film it, and when I came back out, I could only see a tiny red light moving slowly across the sky away from my neighborhood, but I was only gone maybe 6 seconds and it was fairly small and far away, by then.  That's what I was afraid of leaving, because I wanted to see if it would disappear or take off fast or slow and I missed it.  It was very close and I couldn't hear any sound at all.
