(prior to this I observed 1 target in the same direction of travel 15 minutes prior, this must been a lead craft) they appeared to be square shaped with a orange white glow, like when the sun goes down,they appeared to be turning in a clockwise direction. As they continued North Bound they disappeared. I lost sight of them. The location of the sighting was in the backyard of my house. I have never seen this type of craft before. These targets were moving at est. 300 kts, I estimate the altitude at 18000-20000'  this whole ordeal lasted apx. 30 seconds;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
