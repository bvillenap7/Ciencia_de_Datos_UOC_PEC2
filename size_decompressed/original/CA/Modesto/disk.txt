Disc moving westerly in Modesto CA.;2011-03-26 22:30:00;15 min.;Disc moving westerly in Modesto CA. Disc-shaped UFO in sky beneath clouds.  It had multiple lights in a row around the edge of the disc that were pinkish-blue in colour.  The lights did not blink nor flicker.  It seemed to move in a westerly direction, although it had disappeared in a blink of an eye (literally) and seemed to have reappeared just as quickly, moving in the same westerly direction.   I proceeded to turn north going home and lost sight of it shortly after that.   Wondering if anyone else saw it too...?
