Triangular object in night sky over central valley in No. Ca., seen from Sierra Foothills;1998-08-10 22:00:00;20 minutes;Triangular object in night sky over central valley in No. Ca., seen from Sierra Foothills 9/19/10  In the beginning of August in 1998, with another family we departed in a passenger van to go on a holiday together. We were headed to Yosemite Valley. We crossed the central valley in No. Ca., heading east of Modesto on Highway 132. We stopped in the Sierra foothills to camp for the night. Our site was on top of some high hills that overlooked (maybe 1500' above) the central valley floor, and it was clear enough that we could see across (50-60 miles) the valley to the hills on the other side. Settling down for the night, my wife, my son (7 years old then), and me, were sitting outside the tent looking up at the incredibly clear and numerous stars that filled the awesome night sky. In the distance (south & north) we would occasionally see lights from an aircraft. Then we saw this darkish object heading from west to east in the sky. What caught our attention was a small flashing light and it was headed in our general direction. At first it's shape was not clear, but eventually we all could see that it was triangular. It was moving very slowly and silently across the valley floor far below it. We watched this unusual object for maybe 10 minutes until it was above (maybe 5000') our position. Then it made an impossible maneuver: it reversed direction in an instant without ever seeing it actually change direction. That was a very curious instant. It was like for that instant something occurred that was somehow outside of time-space. I don't know how else to express it. We continued to watch this triangular object, as it headed back in the direction and path that it had just come, until it was no longer visible. One thing that struck my wife and I about this object that made it seem like it was of terrestrial origin, was the flashing strobe light just like a normal identifiable aircraft has. I can't imagine that intelligent beings from some other location in time-space or from some other dimension, are going to have strobe lights on their craft when they fly in earth's airspace: like they're following FAA rules!  The most interesting part of this sighting was the direction change instant: other than that it  was boring. It moved so slow and didn't do anything, and it just became a “normal” part of what was in the night sky, nothing special, unlike the incredible stars. These type of UFO's are seen so frequently that although they fall into the UFO category, they don't seem like UFO's. They seem like a terrestrial craft with technology that isn't known. I've seen other incredible UFO's that create an indelible impression, but this triangle isn't even close to that level.

Triangle shaped object with red and blue lights hovered for sometime.;2005-05-28 21:45:00;20 mins;Triangle shaped object with red and blue lights hovered for sometime. We were having a gathering outside our home Sunday May 28th, 2005 when my wife noticed an object in the sky giving off a purpleish light. I looked at it and thought it was only a star, because it wasn't moving so I didn't feel it was an airplane or other aircraft.  The object continue to hover for about another 20 minutes and by now more people were looking at it so I decided to get a pair of binoculars to take a closer.   My heart drop when I focused in and discovered that it was some sort of aircraft, but none like I had ever seen before.  It was a triangle shape with a series of bright blue and red lights (really bright lights).  The object hover a few moments more before it started moving in a side to side motion while dropping lower in the sky at the same time. It finally flew out of view after we watched it for about 15 minutes. It was too far away to photograph.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Couldn't believe what I was seeing!;2007-03-08 13:00:00;10 seconds;Couldn't believe what I was seeing! I was in my back yard meditating soaking up the sun, then I started to skim my pool. I looked at some high clouds to the northwest and noticed and odd shape to them I stared at it for a few seconds then all of a sudden this dot appeared out of the clouds headed towards the southeast. As it flew over it had a traingular wing shape with soft, round edges and a hump in the front, greyish blue in color, no lights and completely silent. It went from the northwest to the southwest in a matter of seconds and did not leave a jet trail. Probably at an altitude of 10,000 feet.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Triangular shaped, low altitude, white, solid lights were sporadically moving in the night sky in complete silence, lasted 40 sec;2007-09-02 20:45:00;40 sec;Triangular shaped, low altitude, white, solid lights were sporadically moving in the night sky in complete silence, lasted 40 sec On September 2, 2007 at approximately 8:45 pm, about 130 miles south of Sacramento my parents, wife and I were driving north on the Interstate 5 (I5). Suddenly, on the right hand side, about ¾ mile away from us we spotted low altitude, whitish, solid color dots shaped like a triangular. Each light seemed approximately as big as 10 stars put together. If I took a quarter and stretched my hand toward the lights, I would cover them with the quarter. The lights were hanging in the air for a few seconds, and then with a fraction of a second they jumped over the freeway (approximately one mile) and started rapidly approaching as. As they moved, we saw that they changed colors (I saw one white color changed to red however, we could not agree the exact colors).  Then, they froze in the air for a few seconds and jumped back where they came from. Then the lights started slowly twisting around one light and formed a triangle that looked like a starched V (if you connect the dots, it would look like a long arch). Then the lights flipped over and started rapidly moving away to the fields. The altitude was so low, that they would hide behind the trees a few times. Finally, the lights faded away. The whole scene lasted for about 40 seconds. The night was clear (we observed lots of stars). There was no sound (except the sounds of highway). It was no hallucination, because we all described the scene in almost the same words (I talked to each family member privately after we came back home). Also, I looked this place up in the map and I found out there was so called Crow Landing Field not far from where it happened. Two weeks later I called the Modesto County Police Department and local newspaper, but there were no reports about such thing.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Low level Triangular shaped aircraft with many red and white flashing lights;2008-09-04 21:15:00;90 seconds;Low level Triangular shaped aircraft with many red and white flashing lights I just went for a bike ride this evening, and at about 9:15 pm I heard the hum of what sounded like maybe an aircraft overhead. I looked up, and at about 1000 feet saw what appeared to be a triangular shaped aircraft with red and white blinking lights down both sides (where the wings would be), and across the back (where the tail wing would be). There was also a high beam light on the front, and I could see it's beam across the sky for some distance. My first thought was that it was a plane landing at the local airport, but I have seen a lot of such planes over the past 40 plus years, and this craft looked very different. My next thought was that it looked more like a stealth bomber. I watched it as I was riding my bike, and since it was going in the opposite direction as me I made a quick little U-turn (maybe 2-3 seconds). When I looked back up it was gone. The sky was very clear, and I could see the stars in the sky, but the craft was gone that fast. I called the local PD to see if anyone had reported see anything like I saw, they said no. I tried to call the control tower at our local airport, but they close at 9:00 pm, so no aircraft would have been landing there at the time anyway. This was not the sighting of some fuzzy object, or distant light. This was an aircraft that I could clearly see the outline of by the many blinking lights along its sides (6-8), and back (3-4), and hear the hum of it’s engines.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Triangle shaped object speeding over town at night.;2008-11-06 21:00:00;4 - 6 sec.;Triangle shaped object speeding over town at night. Equilateral triangular shaped object, approx. 700-1000 ft altitude moving south/southwest at approx. 200-500 mph in sky above central Modesto. 'Wing' span approx. 20 ft. About 5 to 8 dim white lights along triangle shape edge, one on each corner and at least one light per side of shape. No colored lights as many planes have. Not blinking, flashing or beaming. Trees lining the street ended any further observation.  Dark, starry night, seen just outside home while having a smoke break.  Closest man-made object would be a stealth bomber, but had the shape of a stealth fighter, albeit much bigger.  I've seen an actual stealth in flight before.  After observation, I thought it might have been flock of birds moving south for the winter, but speed was too great, and they were dim lights, not reflections of light from the ground.  Object made no sound at all.  It was no natural phenomenon, smoke, balloon or known man-made aircraft in my opinion.  Not a satellite or missile.   Local airport assumed not in service.  Moon was out but in another part of the sky, also visible.  Object flew in straight path, did not hover or change course or altitude.    I was not under any influence or intoxication at time of sighting.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

My monitor is 2 feet next to right of my window.  My room is on the second level of my home.   A bright blue light caught my eye at a 45 degree angle to my view of my monitor.    I turned to observe the light and saw a triangle shaped light, very bright and very large moving from west to east.   The trajectory was downward a few degrees and about 14 degrees off the horizon.  It moved fast but not to fast not to make out the shape.   I didn't observe any streaks like you see from a meteor.  No blinking lights, just a very light blue bright object moving fast through the sky.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Triangle shaped aircraft with three lights flying high and quiet.;2020-04-22 23:15:00;40 seconds;Triangle shaped aircraft with three lights flying high and quiet. My husband and I were out stargazing during the meteor shower.  We saw a triangular craft flying south to north.  It had three lights that were dim.  One on each point in a triangle shape, or it was three aircraft flying at the exact same rate of speed in a triangular formation.  It was flying much faster than the average airplane and it made no noise.  It was very dark against the night sky.  My husband suspects it was some kind of military aircraft.  It was so dark that it was hard to notice at all.  It almost looked like a shadow going across the sky.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
huge, triangular craft, silent sighting in Modesto (Highway Village Area);2020-07-20 16:55:00;1 hour;huge, triangular craft, silent sighting in Modesto (Highway Village Area) Me, My husband,Father in law, and 12yr old son were sitting outside our home looking at our zodiac signs in the sky, when all a sudden we spotted a huge light that came towards us at first we thought it might have been a drone until it came right over us and it was a triangle craft with three lights in each corner one light was solid red while the other 2 were whitish-yellow.  It made no sound at all and it was about 60ft wide huge craft.  It moved side to side, up and down, hovering over the 99 highway then would circle around our neighborhood again our neighbors also were watching.  We followed the craft on foot and in our vehicle.  After it got to the salida area it shot out of sight so fast we were in shock.  I posted videos of it on youtube if interested called modesto ca ufo sighting under melissa&jonathan helton.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
UFO'S RESPOND TO PURE INTENT, CONSCIOUS COMMUNICATION, AND EVEN LIGHT COMMUNICATION!!!;2021-06-11 23:00:00;4 hours;UFO'S RESPOND TO PURE INTENT, CONSCIOUS COMMUNICATION, AND EVEN LIGHT COMMUNICATION!!! On the night of june 11th my lady and I decided to go stargazing as we usually do. Now while we usually see a few things here and there that we cannot explain, last night there was an unmistakably great number of lights forming triangles in the sky, not only that but there were many smaller singular lights floating around and even seemingly coming out of these triangle shaped objects which were absolutely massive in size. There were also a great number of regular planes, drones, helicopters and what else have you that we could definitely tell were human made, trying to follow and observe these objects. My lady and I both witnessed these objects firing blue beams of light in all different directions, not only that but we saw massive flashes across the entire night sky as if it was sheet lightning as well as hearing loud explosions the likes of which did not sound familiar to fireworks or gunshots at all. In an effort to try to make peaceful contact I took my ! phone out and began using the flash on it to try and communicate with one of the triangles directly above me. It was then I realized I was definitely not hallucinating as the massive triangle would follow the direction of the light I would place either on the ground or facing directly at it. It would absolutely mirror every movement of the light on my phone, so in an even greater attempt at communicating, we decided to close our minds and try to consciously connect with them, even sometimes out loud asking them to sway side to side or even make drastic movement so we knew we were not making a complete fool of ourselves, and to our surprise it actually listened!!! Not just one of these triangles but a few of them actually communicated back If you would call that a form of communication. I also saw a dark disk shaped ufo only a trees length high doing flips and spins through the air as it passed over the night sky directly above me. This was after I asked them to send somethi! ng or someone closer so I could know the truth about this. Thi! s is not the first time I've made direct contact with these craft.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
