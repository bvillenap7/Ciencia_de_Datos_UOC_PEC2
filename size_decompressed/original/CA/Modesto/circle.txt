Spinning circle in the sky;1992-07-10 23:00:00;15 seconds;Spinning circle in the sky  500 Lights On Object0: Yes This happened in June or July of 1992 in Modesto, California, on the end of McHenry Ave opposite the park- towards the direction of Riverbank and Escalon.  I was lying down on a sleeping bag outside on a field looking up in to the night sky.   Something came from who knows what direction and stopped in the sky far above me.  It was closer than a star and it seemed to be spinning with lights all around it- like a Frisbee with lights I guess.  It stayed there for ten seconds or so, maybe slightly longer and then took off again at an incredible speed.  As far as I know an airplane canâ€™t stop in midair- spin in a circle, and then jet off out of sight in a second or less than a second.  Also, when I was older at my mothers I remember waking up in the middle of the night or the early morning.  There was a bright white light in my room and outside my window.  I got the feeling like something was checking up on me.  Then I went back to sleep.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

I filmed for 3hrs and looked at the film and had a reaction from the star, at the same time the dog in the back yard began to howl for long periods of time. This is not the first time I've seen objects from the star, but this time I have it on tape (VCR). I dont know much about space but I do know what I have seen and have for a long time. I cannot E-mail video because I'm new on the computer.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

From very Bright to dim.;2005-10-04 19:00:00;20 sec;From very Bright to dim. Ilive in Patterson a few miles away from Modesto and was star gazing, when I looked to the East and saw a very Bright object it out shined all the stars and plants in the sky. And it was very low, at first I thought it was a satellite, some times they do that and then then get dim again. And you can see them fly off in a stright line, but after this one went dim not more then 5 seconds later just obove where the other one was a secound light and it lite up and just as bright as the first and and you could see the other one below the bright one, both after they became dim travled North West and out of sight. they stayed low intill I couldn't see them any more, It would be hard to believe that no one else saw them.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

We were sitting on the grass at La Loma park in Modesto having a burger when I looked up and noticed a small metalic like object in the sky. It did not move for about 5 minutes. It seem to be very high up and in broad daylight it just stayed there. I asked all around me if they could see it and they did, we took a few pictures of it but they did not come out too well since it was so high up. it was almost directly above us. Though it did not move at all it did just disapear right in front of our eyes. Have no Idea what this was.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

Single object, glowing red, hovering in place with no nosie or movemrnt in the night sky.;2014-01-01 00:10:00;5 minutes;Single object, glowing red, hovering in place with no nosie or movemrnt in the night sky. Single object was red in color.  Steady solid red color light.  It was not blinking like an aircraft  would.  It remained high over the town, below 10,000 feet would be my best guess.  It did not seem to move but hovered in place.  The duration was like 5 mins until it disappeared in the blacken sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.

It was bigger than the average star and stayed in one place. It constantly changed colors from red, green, blue, white, orange and yellow.  It did not move while we watched it.  All of our pets (2 cats and a dog) and our daughter were very on edge while it was there.  Our daughter has always been a solid sleeper and she woke up right before we saw it and was afraid to sleep by herself.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
