'Bolt' from Canis Major-complete stop at SextansBriliant object leaves no contrail /debris Witnessed by 3-CALIFORNIA,USA;2004-05-31 21:00:00;1.5-2 minutes;'Bolt' from Canis Major-complete stop at SextansBriliant object leaves no contrail /debris Witnessed by 3-CALIFORNIA,USA At approximately 2100 hours on the 31st of May (Memorial Day Monday),in the south eastern sky while glancing up at Canis Major I observed an out of place luminous    object twice the magnitude and intensity as Polaris. Immediately I knew that the object didn't belong in that quadrant of the night sky. I brought it to the attention of 2 nearby friends. At the moment that the individuals gazed in the direction of Canis Major, the object (void of contrail or trailing burn off debris) bolted to the east for about 1-1.5 seconds coming to a full stop within the Sextans Star Formation.It held almost perfectly still for 10 seconds, then In a wobbly manner appeared to decend, as well as dramatically decrease its intensity and magnitude to a faint pinhead object. At this point it was almost behind the house tops. This was a magnificant white light that appeared to (along it's decent) jettisen one other Gold colored object wich remained stationary for about 4 minutes then We lost siter of it. The Main Object was so intensly bright that disearning a shape wasn't possible. If I had to hypothesis I would say it was probably sherical or round.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787

This bright colorful light was spinning it seemed like far away in the north east sky.   ((NUFORC Note:  Probable star.  PD));2008-08-21 01:00:00;30 minutes;This bright colorful light was spinning it seemed like far away in the north east sky. It first looked to be a plane, or maybe a satelite, but it was stationary for at least 15 minutes, but through the binoculars it looked like it was spinning. It also looked like it may have been jumping around a bit. It was emitting red and blue and white lights. After a while it slowly started to move to the right, and then up. I have seen the same object once before about 8 months ago. Very strange.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
Slowly pulsing red light moving slowly in a south east direction over Modesto, Ca.;2009-01-20 19:45:00;2 minutes;Slowly pulsing red light moving slowly in a south east direction over Modesto, Ca. I was driving home from work, south on highway 99 from Ripon, Ca. In the south east direction (30 Deg above the horizon) I noticed a red light, pulsing very slowly. At first I thought it was a tower, but then I realized it was slowly moving. There were no other lights on the object other than the pulsing red. It seemed to be moving further south. I continued to watch it for about 2 minutes, then it was gone. It didn't just fade out, one moment it was there, then it was gone. I'm a former Navy Aviation Technician and a fan of aviation in general. I know what to look for when describing planes, helos, and jets. This object looked so foreign and out of place to me. I called my 13 year old son to look in that direction and he found it. He stated, in a very excited voice that it was buzzing around. I, however, did not witness this. After a few minutes, he lost sight of it as well.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
green light over modesto;2010-06-02 23:15:00;2 sec;green light over modesto I was driving home from manteca heading southbound towards modesto, doing about 65 mph. i saw a bright greenish light pretty far up (can say how far becuase im not exactly sure what its true size was) moving amazingly fast in a north to south direction. i saw it streak from the top of my windshield and disapear in about 2 seconds. this is the second time ive seen it in the last 30 days. last time i saw it it did pretty much the same thing. After 2 sec it simply dissapeared.;37.6597064766839;-120.989695336787
UFO making weird descent at a weird angle I've never seen before and I've seen all kinds of craft overhead for 30+ years, military/non.;2011-05-29 17:00:00;5-8 minutes;UFO making weird descent at a weird angle I've never seen before and I've seen all kinds of craft overhead for 30+ years, military/non. Hi,  I am not a big UFO type person who believes in UFO's.   I was laying out in my backyard, just a few minutes ago.  I was staring at the clouds and watching a few sets join together over a 30 minute period.  It's windy here.   All of a sudden, a bright white, thin object appears between them, descending at an angle I've never seen above me in these skies and I've been here for 30+ years.   There is an airplaine route above since I was a kid, this plane was NOT on the same flight pattern and it was diving in such a weird angle, I HONESTLY thought it was a plane going down or a space shuttle craft descending at a weird long angle.   Next thing I knew, it disappeared COMPLETLY after it went behind A SMALL SET OF CLOUDS.   I backed up enough feet to make sure the craft made it out of the other side of the cloud.  I waited, & waited, & waited.  It was gone.   I could probably draw it, and the clouds, because I have a photographic memory which my relatives and friends can back up.   This is NOT like me to write about UFO's.  But, I saw one.  Not saying it was Alien, but it was the defined term UFO.
