Three white or metallic spheres flying in a modified triangular formation;2018-11-28 13:22:00;5-10 minutes;Three white or metallic spheres flying in a modified triangular formation I was at lunch and heard the sound of a prop plane overhead.   I work near the Perris Valley Skydiving center and the prop planes are making trips several times a day.  (March Air Reserve Base is also within 5 miles of the location).  As I looked directly overhead I watched the white plane slowly pass by in the clear blue sky.  As it passed I noticed a small group of what appeared to be white or metallic dots/spheres, which were above where the plane had just passed.  The planes altitude I would estimate was approx 1500 feet.  My guess on the spheres would be 2500-3000 feet if not higher.  I probably wouldn't have noticed them if they weren't in a modified triangular formation and moving apart but maintaining similar formation.  I continued watching as they moved Northeast across the sky, at a relatively slow speed.  Although they grew further apart they kept the triangular formation.  All I had was my cellphone and I took several pictures and a somewhat grainy video a! s i tried to zoom in on the objects.  My first thought was mylar balloons until they kept formation as they moved in the sky.  The event lasted about 5-10 minutes.;33.8075644295303;-117.316308053691
