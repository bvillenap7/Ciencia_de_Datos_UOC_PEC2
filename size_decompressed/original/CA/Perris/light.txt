At first glance I thought it was a street light, but it was a little to high.  When I relized that it was an unusual light I thought SPACESHIP. The dull orange light was only about 100ft from my car.  I kept driving, not really staring at the light, due to fear. I then made a right on Placentia. The light was now about a half a mile away and now moving north at a rising 30 degree angle. It was heading towards March AFB. I finally got home, told my parents and my sister to come and see the UFO. When they got out side the light was moving slowly up.  The light was, at the most, four miles from us. I did not see it move that distance in that short of time. The light then made a fast U-shaped turn in the sky and went out. The whole ordeal only lasted about three minutes. We were awe struck and went in telling ourselves that there was some simple explanation for that. Ya right. I am a college student at UCR. I have always been trustworthy and honost. My mother grew up in Orange County. She sings in a local church band. My fatheralso grew up in Orange county. He plays drums for that same band and preaches every third Sunday of the month. My sister graduated From Rancho Verde and now has a child and works as crowd control at Disneyland.;33.8075644295303;-117.316308053691
