I am a county employee employed by Riverside County.  I am 26 years old and a mother of four, i am married. I went to bed around 11 o'clock at night.  My aunt which lives with me, who is 39 years old witnessed it first and woke me up to observe it also. She didn't believe what it was she was seeing. I woke up and walked over to my front door and watched it through the screen door from inside my living room.  I couldn't believe my eyes...I was in complete shock. I have never seen anything like this before, I also never witnessed ghost's either we are not big fans of the paranormal. But .....this is crazy....it was round and bright and had a variety of different colors.  Very very bright colors. A mixture of them.  It was red, green, blue, yellow and others also. It moved very rapidly... that is what scared me....if from here it moved very fast as a blink of an eye imagine how fast it really moved up there... it would move from left to right, right to left and slow! ly in a circle movement up and down.  Then after a while I noticed there were four more smaller ones to the left of it they were all lined up side by side....you couldn't see those as clear as the biggest one we seen first.  Eventually it started to move farther and farther away due to the size of it, it was appearing smaller.  The other four stayed in it's places but the big one did appear be moving farther away.  We came inside and talked about it. We are still amazed about what we saw.;33.8075644295303;-117.316308053691
Orange light in sky that makes explosion sounds.;2016-08-22 02:49:00;>20 minutes;Orange light in sky that makes explosion sounds. It started 2 nights ago, on 08/20/16,  my brother was driving home at about 10:15 PM when he saw the object flying in the air.  It was a single glowing red-orange light floating about 150 feet in the air, irregularly pulsating.  He immediately could tell it wasn’t a plane or helicopter, as he came closer to the neighborhood he said that the light grew in intensity and brightness before flashing and exploding in what he described as looking like “sparks and drops of liquid metal”. I was at home at the time, I was organizing some papers when I heard a loud explosion, I couldn’t tell if it was a gunshot or fireworks but didn’t think too much of it.  When my brother arrived home he told me to come outside and check out the strange light.  It definitely wasn’t a plane or helicopter, my first thought was a quadcopter drone.  But those are often loud and usually have red and green lights, if any.  This was a single orange light that was floating silently from southwest to northeast.  I was only able to see it for about 5 minutes before it just suddenly vanished.  Frustratingly, it disappeared before I could get any pictures. It happened a second time tonight (08/22/16).  It was about 2:40 AM, I was staying up late doing some reading and I heard an extremely loud and percussive boom from outside, it sounded like a grenade went off across the street.  It was echoing off of nearby hills it was so loud. I ran outside to see what was happening, dogs were barking all around the neighborhood because of the sound.  I thought about the light from 2 nights ago and started looking up to see if it was there, sure enough, the same glowing orange light was silently floating above my neighborhood, this time it was much higher in altitude, maybe 500-1000 feet.  Again, it  was floating from southwest to northeast, irregularly pulsing in a red-orange hue.  A bit redder than a campfire usually is.  This time though, it kept moving until it suddenly stopped moving and was stationary in the sky.  I was able to get an old telescope out to get a better look, but I couldn’t see any definite features.  Even in the telescope it ! was just an orange light.  To the naked eye it looked completely stationary, but in the telescope you see it slowing moving around, hovering in place.  It slowly faded away until it disappeared about 20 minutes after I started watching it.  This time I was able to capture a few pictures of it on my cellphone, which doesn’t show much other than a dot in the sky, but it does show up.  Very weird experiences.  I’m going to try and be watchful and study it more, if it happens again.;33.8075644295303;-117.316308053691
