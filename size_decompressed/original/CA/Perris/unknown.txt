Slow moving bright light shoots pyrotechnic toward ground over rural Perris, Gavilan Hills.;2016-08-22 02:25:00;40 minutes;Slow moving bright light shoots pyrotechnic toward ground over rural Perris, Gavilan Hills. I saw an unusual light in the sky Mon. 8/22/2016, between 0225 and 0305 hrs., moving from the SW.  It was reasonably bright and not moving fast like an airplane, I suspect it was a drone.   As it got closer it released or fired a pyrotechnic mortar that went down a 100 or so feet and exploded with a very loud boom, this was an airburst apprx. 150 feet above ground with a smoke cloud that drifted north this was at 0245.  I continued to watch as it turned east and continued till I lost site of it at 0305.  I reported to local fire dept as this could have started a brush fire had it made it to the ground.  Their response was no response.;33.8075644295303;-117.316308053691
