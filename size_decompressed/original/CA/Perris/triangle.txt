Incredible flying triangle of immense proportions with unbelievable speed and eerie stealth!;1990-08-15 03:00:00;5 Seconds;Incredible flying triangle of immense proportions with unbelievable speed and eerie stealth! I was gazing into the early morning sky at around 03:00 during the time that Haley's comet was supposed to be seen, hopeing to view what was supposed to be visible by eye.  It was a very clear, quiet night with no moon visible.  As I was looking southwest I noticed movement in my periferal vision from the west and glanced in that direction.  I was stunned by what I saw.  An object traveling from the west to the east was blocking out the stars in the sky as it flew past at an extremely high rate of speed directly over my head.  The object was triangular in shape with the widest part being wing tip to wing tip.  The shear size of the object took my breath away.  It flew low to the ground, less than 600 feet.  From wing tip to wing tip I would estimate it to be 300 yards across.  From nose to tail approximately 100 yards.  It appeared to be rather flat from top to bottom, no more than 20 yards thick.  All of the edges seemed rounded, not sharp or crisp.  This object had no external lights that could be seen from below.  It had a dark, dull metallic sheen similar to the dull side of aluminum foil which reflected city light from below.  It's stealth and speed was nerve shaking.  As it passed I looked for exhaust flames, ports or vapors and I was astonished that there were none.  I waited for the sonic booms to follow as I new that this aircraft was traveling in excess of Mach 1.  I have seen small Air Force jets at Mach 1 or greater and know the speed and sounds they create at those speeds.  This huge object flew faster than any aircraft I have ever seen and did not make a sound, not even a low rumble.  There was nothing but silence.  I was in awe and disbelief of what I had witnessed.  I stood there for 30 minutes or more hoping to see another flyby and still contemplating what I saw and if I really did see it.  The total length of time of this brief veiwing lasted no more than 5 seconds. I waited for days to read something in the newspapers to verify what I saw by others.  I lived very close to March A.F.! B. and t hought that surely they picked this craft up on radar and would leak something.  I have told only a select few friends of what I witnessed that night, not wanting to be labled as crazy.  They think I'm crazy.  I just happened to be at the right place at the right time, looking up at the sky.  What prompted me to write my account at this late date was an account by someone else that was very similar to mine, who posted with your site.  The occurance date was 4/27/2001, location-Alpine, CA. and Triangle shaped.  My mm/dd/yy may be off slightly as I am not sure of the exact date but I can pinpoint very close due to certain events that took place during that time.  Haley's comet was to be visible by eye and a certain pilot of a famous politician or celebrity died in an experimental aircraft testing crash in the Nevada desert I believe.   I am an honorably discharged veteran of the Air Force and have seen many of our government aircraft including the stealth bomber and stealth fighter aircraft as well as the SR-71.  This craft is none of those or even close.  I only hope that it is one of ours, if it's not, we are seriously outmatched! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.8075644295303;-117.316308053691
Followed by pulsating triangular lights in the night sky for 45 mins through the desert;2005-11-12 22:00:00;45 mins;Followed by pulsating triangular lights in the night sky for 45 mins through the desert We were followed by these lights that were triangular shaped but pulsated from the center  out and back in again for approx 45 mins. From the CA State I15 hwy north to the I60 east to the I10 east to Palm Springs CA they stopped when we stopped at the whitewater turn off. I told my wife as we were being followed to slow way down just to see if it was nothing but then it slowed to our speed too!  My 2 girls 12-13 were getting very jumpy as was my wife the driver. Me, I didnt know what to think. Finnaly I told her to pull off and stop. I wasn't going to take this thing home with us!  The lights then hovered over us pulsating in and out in a triangular formation. I called the CHP and explained the situation.  They said they would have a car dispathced. At the off ramp there was a trucker who was also looking up at the unusual activity in the night sky. But why where they following us?  We sat there for a good 10 mins waiting for the CHP and of course they never showed, when all at once they were gone just as fast as they showed up.  No trail or nothing just gone, no noise nothing just the lights pulsating then nothing. We got back into the car and headed on down the I10 east to home.  A night to never forget. Now my girls freak out when ever we travel that stretch of highway. And at times they swear they see them in the night desert sky. I guess they'll never be the same.;33.8075644295303;-117.316308053691

Large black triangle hovering between 1500-2500 high then slowly crept northward at 50-80mph.;2010-01-28 18:10:00;10 minutes;Large black triangle hovering between 1500-2500 high then slowly crept northward at 50-80mph. Date: Jan28, 2010 Time:  ~ 6:00 pm. I was driving southbound on the 215 from Redlands, CA towards Temecula.  I saw lights hovering for many minutes wondering what it was off in the distance.  Typically I see planes flying low along this stretch of highway because they are landing at March Air Reserve Base, but this was no jet.  I was just north of Ethanac exit when the object was directly overhead.  The object had caused many of the drivers on the freeway to slow and gaze upward.  I pretty much stopped and stared up at a huge black triangle.  There were 3 lights, white, not blinking at all at each apex.  The triangle was equilateral in shape.  It did not make any noise. The object was between 150-250 ft across, from tip to midpoint of opposite edge. I exited the freeway and made two rights to head north again.  I phoned home and told my girlfriend what happened.  I tried to catch up to the object but with recent rain and poor quality of roads as well as obeying traffic laws I could not get underneath it again.  Eventually I pulled over and watch it float northward directly over the base and continue going. Background of witness: •	College Graduate:  BS Geography •	31 year old male •	Long time resident of area where triangle observed •	Working professional for large geographic science software company •	20/20 vision – good health (mentally and physically) •	Familiarity with commercial and military aircraft shapes and sizes. Personally witnessed B2 stealth bomber flying over Chargers stadium during super bowl. What I saw was not a b2 bomber.  Lived just north of NAS Miramar for many years. •	Upon reading findings from The National Institute for Discovery Science regarding triangle sightings I decided to report what I saw.;33.8075644295303;-117.316308053691
