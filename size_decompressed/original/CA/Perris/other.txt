WHEN I WHENT OUTSIDE SHE TOLD ME TO LOOK UP AND SHE POINTED.  AT FIRST I DID NOT KNOW WHAT SHE WAS POINTING AT BUT AS I LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION SHE WAS POINTING AT 7 OBJECTS IN THE SKY.  THESE OBJECT WERE HOVERING IN THE AIR, GOING UP AND DOWN, SIDE TO SIDE, THEN THEY SEAM TO BE GOING IN SOME SORT OF FORMATION. THE FORMATION SEAM TO BE A 3 AND ARROW FORMATION.   THE OBJECTS SEAM TO BE CHANGING COLORS  FROM WHITE TO GRAY AND BLACK AND ALSO A TITANNIUM COLOR.  THESE OBJECTS LOOK LIKE THEY WERE HALF A SPHERE.  I TOLD MY BROTHER TO GET THE CAMERA, THE OBJECT  WENT INTO A V FORMATION AND TUCK OFF TOWARD HEMET AND DISAPEARED.;33.8075644295303;-117.316308053691
2 vertical lines of red lights seen and were moving right to left like tilting right to left;2015-02-05 20:10:00;10 minutes;2 vertical lines of red lights seen and were moving right to left like tilting right to left weird lights in Perris.  I walked out of the house and looked to the left to see what looked like two sets of 5 lights, the top light on each side would go off and on same time and the whole thing moved left and right.  I know the top of that hill I have been up there.  There are no homes there for about a mile or so.  If you could imagine a string going vertical 15 feet up with 5 red lights on it and then another string same as the first with the same 5 red lights on it about 5 feet apart is how I can kinda describe it. here is the youtube video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkQgn2r92OQ&feature=youtu.be;33.8075644295303;-117.316308053691

I could hear airplane of parachuters but no sound of craft.  It flew approx. 1000 ft overhead at approx. 200 mph.   I thought it was a Cessna at first with wings up and down flying sideways but was too fast.  no lights or colors.;33.8075644295303;-117.316308053691
Large cluster/array (about 150 small and 5-10 - much larger white ones) of multi-colored lights slowly descending below the tree-line.;2019-10-18 20:07:00;2 minutes;Large cluster/array (about 150 small and 5-10 - much larger white ones) of multi-colored lights slowly descending below the tree-line. I saw a huge cluster of lights in the night sky shortly after 10:00 hours. It is difficult to estimate the size of the array but the majority of the lights - about 100-150 - were primarily multi-colored (not vivid but soft hues pink/yellow/green/light blues etc) with several white lights - 5-10 - that were much larger in size. The cluster was low on the horizon above the tree-line when I noticed it. My best estimate is that it was at least 2 or 3 miles across and 1 mile from top to bottom and 5-10 miles away, perhaps even 20 miles away. I stared for a few seconds before going inside my house to ask my wife to come take a look. I immediately realized the cluster was slowly descending below the tree-line and we could only see the upper portion. The array was still clearly visible and she witnessed it too. She went to get her mom from inside the house but the lights had descended out of sight from our viewpoint.;33.8075644295303;-117.316308053691
