silver  sphere over refinery by LAX;2002-03-03 12:00:00;30 minutes;silver  sphere over refinery by LAX At approximately 12 noon, on or about 3 March, 2002 I saw a silver, spherical object (looked like a giant ball of tinfoil) floating over the El Segundo Refinery. The airspace over the refinery is restricted. The object hovered at approx. 1000ft and was about the size of a minivan, and was being buffeted by the 10-15mph wind blowing from the Northeast to the Southwest.(The wind normally blows from West to East). The object slowly floated up in a northern direction but generally remained over the refinery and south El Segundo, California. If it was a balloon of any type, the wind would have blown it out over the ocean. As it floated out of sight, the shape seemed to waiver(did not maintain a distinct shperical shape) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.9214000000001;-118.413
High speed ball follows jet, and becomes two smaller objects.;2004-01-07 16:50:00;15 seconds;High speed ball follows jet, and becomes two smaller objects. I observed a lear jet, approx 3-5000 feet and climbing,traveling southwest probably out of Hawthorne airport. I then saw a black ball about 1/3 the size of the jet approach at a very high speed from the east. I thought I was seeing a missle heading for the jet. Then the object stopped, and began following the jet !  At that point I said to my friend, what the hell is that? He replied, a UFO! The object followed the jet for about 5 seconds, then the object split into 2 objects!(Horizontally or left and right)  These objects were half the size of the original ball, and looked either white or metallic, as they now looked to have the same reflectivity as the jet. We watched these two smaller spheres follow the jet for approx. 5 more seconds until the three objects traveled out of our range of sight.;33.9214000000001;-118.413
