Floating Orb over LAX;2009-02-18 05:56:00;2 minutes;Floating Orb over LAX I got up early this morning to search for the comet Lulin in the direction of Virgo and Leo.  As I pointed my binoculars directly to the ocean, West, I saw what appeared to be a white light moving steadily north.  As it got closer, it got my attention, because it had no strobelight.  It flew over the Los Angeles Airport and I was able to keep an eye on it for approximately 2 minutes till it faded north into sky.   I have seen planes in the area and have become accustomed to see them.  This was not a plane. It was either a satellite, but it appeared too low and too close to be one or something unusual.
