What I'm seeing, please help.;1994-01-01 00:00:00;30 minutes;What I'm seeing, please help. I live in El Segundo, Ca.. I live on the very Westside of my town. Where I live my backyard ends and a sand dune begins for about a football size then starts Hyperion station begins then you’re at the beach. I’m a night owl in bed by 4am. To the south of me is a Chevron refinery and to the north of me is LAX Airport.  For about 20 years or so I’ve seen odd lights in the sand dunes, i.e. (transparent shapes of crafts with lights on top or bottom or the sides or in the middle. The lights are always dim. ).  This happens in all kinds of weather I thought it might be reflex ion from planes taking off or landing or maybe flying over real high but they should change but they don’t.  I don’t have any great cameras that can take black night pictures so I don’t have pictures of them.  The oddness is I have sat in my back yard for 5 mins.  To 1 hour. And odd things happen. In that time have gotten up made myself a cup of tea and have come back and they are still there but if I go 2 house down to a gate to get into the dune they are gone and when I go back home they are still gone. Can they know I’m watching but don’t want me to get to close?  Please can you tell me what I’m seeing?;33.9214000000001;-118.413

I was in a vehicle heading south on Sepulveda Boulevard when we stopped at a red light.  I was in the passenger seat and I looked up at the brilliantly lit skyscrapers on the next block.  It was then that I observed a pitch black flying wing shaped object swoop across my field of vision. It emitted no lights and was moving quite rapidly into a headwind.  I did not see it long enough to get a size but it was approximately forty to fifty feet off the ground and it crossed a sixty foot space in less than three seconds.  It was only visible for a couple of seconds before it vanished into the night sky.  It was so black as to be completely invisible once it was no longer silhouetted against the building.;33.9214000000001;-118.413
