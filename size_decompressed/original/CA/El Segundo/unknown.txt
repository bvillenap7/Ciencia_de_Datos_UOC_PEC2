Invisible Silent Aircraft (UFO) over LAX on 15 Oct 2014;2014-10-15 19:10:00;5 minutes;At approximately 7:10 PM I had a sighting of an Invisible Silent Aircraft (UFO) over LAX on 15 Oct 2014.  It had two white flashing lights (NO red lights like all other aircraft in area had) the distance of approx.. 300 ft. between them. I could compare it to the size of the 747 aircraft  â€“which I could plainly see (with the airline paint color scheme too) - taking off beneath it.  The flashing lights were at first just hovering over the airport runway (just west of the control tower) at a height of 1000 Ft, with the aircraft landing and taking off beneath it.  I at first thought it was a couple of police or news helicopters there, until I saw that there was NO RED flashing lights that all aircraft are supposed to have.  Then the lights started to slowly move one behind the other  in a eastern direction to where Sepulveda Blvd. goes under the runway thru the tunnel.  Then they  moved in  parallel  to each other,  and flew south over Sepulveda Blvd.  at about! 100 ft. until it was near the intersection of Rosecrans. There was NO SOUND there was NOTHING VISIBLE between the lights but I could plainly see that the lights were fixed to a solid object.  At that point it continued to slowly move one light behind the other  in a eastern direction again until I could not distinguish it among the line of aircraft lined up to land at LAX.;33.9214000000001;-118.413
