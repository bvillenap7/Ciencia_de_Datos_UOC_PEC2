Flying V shaped lights, newport beach, ca.1973;1973-06-30 23:00:00;10 seconds;flying V shaped lights, newport beach, ca.1973 It was early seventies in Newport Beach, California.  It’s so long ago, I’m not sure of the exact year, possibly 1973.  I wentto attend a little nightclub there.  It was about 11:00 on a summer night when I parked in the parking lot of the club, walked across the dark lot and looked up, and saw lights in the sky.  There were six white lights flying in vee formation at a very great altitude, like satellites, which I had seen many times in Arizona.  They came up over the hill of the horizon, and flew towards the ocean. There was a light at the tip of the vee, but missing one light at the end of one arm of the vee.  They were bluish white, like medium bright stars, and they made no sound, and flew halfway across the arc of the sky in only about ten seconds.  Suddenly I felt ecstatic and began to leap up and down with my arms outstretched.  They blinked off and vanished all at once. At that time I assumed that they were six separate objects.  In those days there was no talk of giant vee shaped craft.  It didn’t occur to me that anything could be so large but I was still puzzled as to how they could fly in such unwavering precision.

Sitting on Balboa Island looking in the direction of the pavilion which is NW two objects.;2016-02-15 18:00:00;30 minutes;Sitting on Balboa Island looking in the direction of the pavilion which is north west two objects started out being too sets of red lights in a triangle they were about a hundred feet apart but they kept moving in sequence up and down away from each other and then back together at some point they would probably be 2000 feet in the air other points they were down to about a hundred feet off the ground I pointed him out to two ladies who were taking pictures of the pavilion building they didn't see them until I pointed them out their remarks were they must be airplanes I pointed out that no airplane could drop from 2000 feet to 100 feet stop and go back up like a tennis ball these have to be either military drones or there something else UFO what amazes me is nobody noticed them until I pointed them out the way they were zipping around the sky that could not have been an airplane because they stopped they could not have been a helicopter because they move too fast up and down they would take off in opposite directions and then they would return and be within a foot of each other my guess is these crafts were over the ocean because behind the pavilion building you would have the open ocean once or twice I have reported things similar but not the same color when I was in Northern California I saw a blue light red light but that was a couple years ago And on this last incident trying to take a picture of it with a cell phone was impossible they move too quickly and they were not there when you snap the picture all you could get was the glow of the pavilion lights aircraft moving this quickly would have to have some sort of slow film like motion film to get it ((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports, submitted by same witness.
