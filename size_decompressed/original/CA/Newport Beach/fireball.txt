Hovering Red Orbs over the Newport Beach, CA peninsula.;2014-01-10 20:50:00;10 minutes;Hovering Red Orbs over the Newport Beach, CA peninsula I viewed outside my window reddish orange orbs over the coast.  I see plenty of planes flying into John Wayne Airport and plenty of helicopters flying over the peninsula.  These were neither types of craft.  There were no blinking lights whatsoever.  They we're flying a little higher than helicopters fly and hovered for the most part.  I saw two groups of two.  The first set hovered for a while then one disappeared while the other remained.  After about 4 minutes, it headed up and to the north out of site.  The second set was basically the same in that they hovered and stayed still for about 4 minutes.  One of them went up higher into the sky after about 2 minutes and while it was visible to the naked eye, my phone video recorder could no longer pick it up.  The 2nd one disappeared after about 4 - 5 minutes.  At one point I put down my iPhone and zeroed in with binoculars that I have.  I could not make out any type of metal or material on the craft.  It seemed to be comprised of multiple lights of the same size and luminosity.  This is the 3rd time I've spotted these craft over the same area of sky outside my window.  I have never seen them any where else.;33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952

Orangish-Red UFO disappears.;2014-06-15 21:15:00;4 minutes;Orangish-Red UFO Disappears I was leaving a Father's Day party at my friend's house and we were saying our goodbyes out in the front lawn.   Someone mentioned a plane departing from John Wayne Airport and we all looked up to look at it.  I then noticed that there was another plane but it was of an orangish-red color.   I thought it was strange and told everyone to look at it and then it all of the sudden stopped we all thought that was unusual, as planes don't just stop mid-air like helicopters.   We were trying to figure out what it was, assuming it was a plane, but then it started to disappear.  It got more faint, but in a pulse-like fashion.  Then it was gone.   As we were all looking at the sky wondering where it went, we then saw a little dot of the orangish-red color shoot straight up into the sky and we couldn't see anything anymore.;33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952

Three fireball objects seen by witnesses fading in and out of view over the ocean.  Location was off the coast from Newport Beach, CA.;2016-09-21 05:16:00;5 minutes;Three fireball objects seen by witnesses fading in and out of view over the ocean.  Location was off the coast from Newport Beach, CA.  The orbs traveled an estimated distance from Palos Verdes to Catalina island.  This distance would be covered in a matter of seconds numerous times.   All weather was clear with very few clouds.   Objects heading in same trajectory and would move consecutively at a high rate of speed.  Some deviation occurred from flight path in a strafing motion.  The craft were glowing with a yellow or orange hue.  They would appear in one place then return to original position while fading to dim light then progressively getting brighter.;33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
