It's;2002-12-15 21:00:00;1.5 minutes;Just happened to be in the backyard looking up and saw a bright pinpoint of light.  Very high up, probably above the atmosphere.  It's size was undeterminable due to its height.  It moved from a Northeast to Southwest direction at an alarming rate of speed.  I am an amateur star gazer/sky wathcer and I know what a satellite looks like moving across the night sky.  I don't know of any satellites that move from East to West, and I've never seen a sattelite moving this fast before.  It crossed the portion of sky visible to me (120 degrees) in less than 45 seconds.  There was no sound nor any streak or trail behind it.  I followed it until it disappeared over the trees.  My best explanation other than some kind of vehicle would be a meteor that passed close to Earth, but I saw no reports either way.  I am uncertain about the date and/or time, and had I known there was a website, I would have reported when it happened.  I know it was late in the year 2002 and that it was around 8:00 pm.  It was nearly directly overhead but just slightly Southwest. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
Bright light appears over the ocean in Newport Beach for 3 minutes on Friday 12-30-16.  ((anonymous report));2016-12-30 20:30:00;3 minutes;Bright light appears over the ocean in Newport Beach for 3 minutes on Friday 12-30-16 We were at Balboa Pier, in Newport Beach, California, at approximately 8:15pm pacific time on 12-30-16.  We were looking at the horizon to the west into the ocean, for the moon, (which there wasn't) and noticed a steak in the clouds.  Then out of the clouds suddenly a bright round light appeared.  We were saying to one another it was an airplane, but it just stayed in one location for about 3 minutes and then withdrew from its origin in seconds.  With no residual light to be seen or any new light originating.  We all felt like it was peculiar? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Mysterious light moves vertically in the night sky seen from Newport Beach, CA.;2021-08-06 20:33:00;2 min.;Mysterious light moves vertically in the night sky seen from Newport Beach, CA. On the above date and time my wife and I were casually backyard stargazing, looking at Venus, which was getting low in the sky.  From our location, we can observe numerous aircraft constantly come and go in various approach patterns to both John Wayne airport and Long beach airport, and we are quite accustomed to seeing these.  All aircraft display navigation strobes and can be tracked on OpenADSB, which I use for fun.  To the left of Venus we noticed an unidentified light in the sky approximately 5ยบ above the horizon.  Neither of us had noticed the light just a few minutes earlier, and there was no additional detail that would suggest a distance from us.  The light was larger than any of the stars in the sky and indeed bigger than Venus itself.  It therefore appeared to have mass, and it was illuminated, alternating between red and green solid light - not strobes - with a period of approximately 1 second or less. The light was located in the direction of 240ยบ from Corona Del Mar, CA.  As we observed it, the light ascended vertically approximately three times the distance from the ocean from where we initially noticed it.  The ascension took approximately 1 to 1.5 seconds and was clearly not aeronautical in nature, as airplanes do not move vertically in such a near-instantaneous manner.  I called to my 15 year-old son to join us, which he did, and he began observing about 5 seconds after the initial, vertical move.  Approximately 5 seconds later, while all three of us watched, the light descended again to its original location, and then, after a second or two, plunged out of site, presumably into the ocean.
