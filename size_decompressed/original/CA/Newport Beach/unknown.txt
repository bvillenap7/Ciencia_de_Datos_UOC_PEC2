UFO spotted over Newport Beach suburb of Corona del Mar, CA at 19:00 Jan. 2, 2007 by 2 witnesses;2007-01-02 19:00:00;10 minutes;UFO spotted over Newport Beach suburb of Corona del Mar, CA at 19:00 Jan. 2, 2007 by 2 witnesses It was dark as I was driving with my 17 year old daughter inside my apartment complex.  The car was facing in the direction of the Pacific Ocean (I live a mile inland) when I noticed a slow moving object with square or rectangular lights low in the sky appearing above the area between Pacific Coast Highway and San Joaquin Hills Drive over Corona del Mar (a suburb of Newport Beach, just south). I could not ascertain how far away the object was but it seemed close.  It was moving slowly and silently southward. We were so shocked that I circled around and parked the car where we could get a better look.  It continued to move slowly and then seemed to go a little higher in the sky as it approached Newport Coast.  I reported this to the Newport Beach Police.;33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
6 Lights hover above Ocean, then one by one, each descends & disappears;2007-01-17 18:40:00;2 min;6 Lights hover above Ocean, then one by one, each descends & disappears S/SE of Catalina Island, 1 to 2 miles offshore, just North of Newport Pier -at first there appeared to be 6 separate bright balls of light hovering in a group, not evenly spaced, of varying altitude (approx. 20-40 Ft) above the ocean. Each ball of light was a bright amber color and had a spotlight-effect illuminating the surface of the ocean below.  The one farthest to the right appeared to descend slowly toward the water surface and disappeared from sight.  The rest seemed to repeat the actions of the first, but at 10-20 second intervals in succession from Right to Left until they all disappeared. There was no heavy marine layer, no audible noise(s) to our bare ears, no apparant water splashing, no aircraft seen flying away.  While cleaning up our tools from a home maintainance job, 5 of us noticed these odd lights at about 6:40pm.;33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
