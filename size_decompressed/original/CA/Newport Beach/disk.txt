Unidentified Disc in plain sight, 1000 ft away, for 30 seconds;1996-06-15 21:00:00;30 seconds;Unidentified Disc in plain sight, 1000 ft away, for 30 seconds I have studied metaphysic's all my adult life. Have been involved with meditation's and various Shamanic work also.  I see this experience as spiritual in nature.  As natural as any other. I also feel honored to have had this experience. I had been on a raw food only diet for a week, no alcohol, no medications, etc. and for the past three day's before the sighting had attended a seminar which had a profound affect on my consciousness. A few hours before the sighting, at the end of the seminar, something happened to my awareness. This must be explained in detail to make sense. I am willing to do that if need be. Anyway I was in an amazing state of bliss. It was something I had never experienced. As I returned home at dusk, after the seminar's completion, I went up to my apartment in Newport Beach, California. As I walked into my place a voice said softly in my ear, Go out to the balcony(second floor). It was not strange to hear this voice in the state that I was in and I slid open the door and went out. The sun had gone down and immediately off to my far right was a ship slowly moving in my direction. John Wayne airport is off in the distance and I remember even seeing, as is the case regularly, a distant plane flying out. I knew immediately this was no airplane, jet or anything else I had ever seen. And it was so close. The ship's details were not clear because it was getting towards dark and the light was not hitting it in front of me. As it moved at about 10-20 mph from a quarter mile away at my right to directly in front of me it was between 500 and 1000 feet from me...right over the parking garage next to my complex. It stopped right in front of me...as if to say hello (that's the feeling I had).  And within 10 seconds of stopping flew off at a 45 degree angle upwards at incomprehensible speed.  It was gone from view in 2 seconds. When the ship was stopped in front of me...I looked down breifly and there were the usual people walking in and out of the large apartment complex but none of them were noticing this craft.  My estimation was it was the size of a football field.  It was circular with noticeable, but undefined, multi-levelled sides.  There were also dim auburn colored lights at a few places on it's side.  Or this may have been the after-sunset reflection. This is the only time I have seen a UFO.  I believe my ability to witness this craft was because of my raised level of consciousness(via an intense seminar, etc). My theory being I met them halfway.

one disk with lights underneath it observed by myself for 2 minutes in the sky stationary as well as moving across sky.;2006-12-02 21:40:00;1-2 minutes;one disk with lights underneath it observed by myself for 2 minutes in the sky stationary as well as moving across sky. I saw one(1) disk.  It had lights on it that formed a circle underneath it.  The light were white or yellowish.  The disk was dark.   I met one person about 20 years ago that told me they saw a ufo, I did not think much of it.  The disk could have been remote controlled from the ground, but it seemed to be to high up and to move in a way that made me think it was not remote controlled.   I observed it for about 2 minutes stationary as well as moving across the sky.   I stopped observing it and went home and it was still in the sky and i did not investigate further.;33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952

We stopped observing it and went to a movie and it was still in the sky and we did not investigate further.  I only made a note here becasue I saw a similiar sighting in NewPort and we were not convinced it was a normal motion for a remote control craft... Weird.....

Flying saucer with lights hovering above Newport Coast;2008-05-30 11:00:00;20 minutes;Flying saucer with lights hovering above Newport Coast The saucer was about 10 feet in diameter. It was round and had blue tinted lights that went around the entire saucer. The lights were circular and were spaced evenly around the saucer. It was moving up and down, and side to side in a smooth manner. It would go in one direction and hover for a few seconds then continue on down the road. We made a u-turn to see if we could catch another glimpse of it. The saucer was kind of going up the hill with us. I got closer and closer and eventually it was about 10 to 15 feet away from us in the car. It seemed to have flashed a bright light at us. It continued to hover around us and then it disappeared into the canyon.;33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
UFO posing as 'bright' star in newport beach california.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Jupiter, perhaps.  PD));2009-12-08 20:00:00;4 hours;UFO posing as 'bright' star in newport beach california Every night from 7pm-11pm my mother and I have witnessed a UFO posing as a bright star and eventually blinks out over the pacific ocean. It starts off as a very intense bright star around 7pm and thoughout the evening moves very very slowly. It starts off in the east and fades over the pacific before it blinks out. I began to realize this isn't a star when I was walking my dog one evening, it was a cloudless summer night in August, it was beautiful to look at the stars and take my dog for a walk. As i began to walk, I looked up at the bright star and it just turned off. I thought that was kind of weird. So when i got home, I sat in my backyard with my mother and told her, as to her dismay she didn't believe me so i wanted to prove it. We watched the star and in 17 minutes time, the star began to move. When it moved, it was wobbly. And right before it moves it shoots off a red light into the air. This happens every night, we are pretty sure this is a traini! ng mission or something of the sort for this UFO that eventually keeps moving very slowly and blinks out over the pacific ocean every night. If you live in newport beach, california look out in the sky around this time for a bright star, it might take roughly 30 minutes for it to move, but you will see this.

Blinding light and loud noises, followed by orbs in the sky.;2016-03-18 00:00:00;~2 hours;Blinding light and loud noises, followed by orbs in the sky. 11:00pm, Newport Beach, CA. My entire house was getting ready for bed, when my Mom called my Brother and me into her bedroom.  She claimed she saw an incredibly blinding bright light, followed by these insane loud noises--that I also heard as I entered her bedroom.  The sounds were loud enough to fill my entire house, at first I thought it was construction, but it was midnight?   I thought of all possible things it could be, but we had never heard anything like it before.  It would just get louder and quieter, I can't even explain the noises, it sounded like muffled harsh rain (not a good example, but I can't describe it?), it was very staticy and so loud, so piercing almost?  And only in one area, the noise was coming from a distance from what we could hear.  Like around the corner?  Very creepy.   The noise would slow down and speed up, and that lasted for about 30 minutes as we watched and listened until it suddenly stopped, we heard soooo many sirens go off after that, and that lasted for 10 minutes, and then th! at also stopped all at once.   Quickly after the noises stopped, we noticed a couple bright orbs in the sky.  We noticed one while the noises were happening, but two more appeared brighter.  I live by an airport and yes, my first thought was helicopter, plane, jet, etc, ANYTHING but  but I have seen those fly overheard before many times.  We could all tell there was a difference. It was nothing we've ever seen before in the sky.  They would kind of faded in and out in a weird fuzzy way.  One of them headed in our direction overhead and we both got a better look at it, I was hanging out of the bedroom window at this point, even in the dark i could clearly see the shape was NOT a plane.  It was circular and disc like, it had a few blinking lights, and it continued to move overhead as well as the other ones surrounding it, they all spread out up until a certain point and then they just stopped and stayed there.  My mother got a video of one of the one moving towards our direction which I will email to you.   We had no idea what we were seeing but w! e just k new and could feel that it was something different.  We all got on our phones and did some research about what we saw, I even tried to see if anybody else had seen or heard things in the area.  The things we read and photos we saw were all things we were just looking at.  It was the most surreal thing, and I truly believe they were UFOs.  Something.  But not planes, there was no way.  It was so crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere about her alleged experience.  PD));33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
