I watched the object fall from the norht towards the south and then suddenly it made a sharp almost 90 degree turn.  I have never seen anything like it. It was so high up in the sky that i could not see the shape of the object ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
3 UFO's over Orange County, CA;2012-05-19 23:00:00;5 min;3 UFO's over Orange County, CA 3 UFO's forming a triangle were noticed while I was driving down Macarthur Blvd.  There is an airport close by but after 9pm all traffic is shut down.  These objects were forming a triangle and making quick movements unlike any plane or helicopter.  One then disappeared above the cloud line. The other 2 came together and then as quickly came away from each other. After a few minutes they both shot above the cloud line.  Never seen anything like it.
