When she said look a UFO and I said what and jumped up from the couch. and looked out the window and saw it.  It look almost like it could have been a plane when I saw it, only with atleast 10 flashing lights going from left to right stopping for just a second and then left to right again. the lights could have been going all the way around the object in a circle but I cant be sure. On top of the object was a stabilized red light almost light it was on the tain of a plain.  It was fairly low in the air like the height of a helicopter only when we went on the deck I couldn't hear it, its speed was also like the speed of a helicopter it was pretty slow.  My girl friend claimed that before I saw it it was going south and then changed direction. to the straight heading I saw which was east Northeast away from Newport beach.;33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
