I was camping testing out my new brookstone CaptureView Binoculars, and I was snapping some shots of boats over the water when I noticed two boats had soart of been rocking back in forth in the same place for a long time. I figured they were boats so I snapped some pics of the two little lights. The next day I plugged my camera into the computer  and the first 2 pictures on the camera were tiny spheres!...at first the picture looked black and that it didnt work, but I blew it up a few times and saw what looks like a sphere being lit from the right side.  I stayed up and watched for awhile but the clouds were rolling in and lights werent doing much of anything, I wonder if the other boats saw them, or if maybe the camera/binoculars made the light look like that and it was just a shrimp boat or something?

Object over ocean 100 feet, came closer to boat stopped for 10 minutes, reversed from same direction and speed and disappeared.;2005-08-06 13:30:00;20 minutes;Object over ocean 100 feet, came closer to boat stopped for 10 minutes, reversed from same direction and speed and disappeared. (8-6-05)  8 Friends were shark fishing off the coast of Newport beach CA about 12 miles off the coast when one of our buddies called out a bright light just hovering over the water about 100 feet.  We thought it was a reflection off a building or a huge ship but realized that no structure could be seen below above or on the side of this spherical object.  We checked the GPS heading and the direction was South West which is only hundreds of miles of ocean, thus that ruled out any reflection on any buildings.  Also, it could not have been a ship because it was 100 feet off the ground with no structure below.  It seemed to be 4 to 5 miles away in the distance but that was our guess. It had no sound of blades on a helicoper as it stood there for 10 minutes hoovering.  Then we noticed it started to get closer and bigger and some friends were getting a little freaked out but I felt only positive from it. Its strange for me to explain but that it what I felt. I knew we had nothing to be worried about.  Then it stopped and hoovered for another 9 or 10 mintues at that moment I got 1 picture of it(not digital) :(.  Then finally the object reversed in the same direction and speed it came from and then just faded out and disappeared.

Large red object flying with six small sphreres;2007-09-30 16:50:00;3 minutes;Large red object flying with six small sphreres I observed a large red object flying very high in the daylight with six small silver spheres in formation. One sphere was ahead of the group and to the right. Four spheres were at and near the red object and one sphere followed a larger distance behind. they were traveling in a northern direction. I suspected this to be a VIP traveling and escorted by military aircraft, but my internet searches only produces other UFO sightings. They were very high and moved at a rate of speed similar to satellites I've seen in the past. I've never seen anything like this and pointed it out to my father-in-law who observed same.;33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
Ball of light at high speed.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2008-10-30 19:00:00;1-2 seconds;Ball of light at high speed   I was taking some friends out for a harbor cruise and while I had to boat in reverse backing out of the dock I saw what I thought was a shooting star as I said Oh look a shooting star then I thought about it and was like shooting stars have tails and this didn't.   It was a ball of white light moving at a high speed from moving from South-East to North-West.  I only saw it for a couple seconds then it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor, we suspect.  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and none of the other people present witnessed the event, which occurred on October 30, not 31.  PD));33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
