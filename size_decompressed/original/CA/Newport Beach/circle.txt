strange bright object observed at noon over southern california;2006-01-05 12:00:00;1 1/2 hrs.;strange bright object observed at noon over southern california First a little background... prior to this event, i had never seen what i could truly call a UFO, I always have been open to the possibility that these entities could exist in our universe... i try to approach these type of issues from a rational and logical perspective. So, the other week I stepped outside my front door here in Southern California to light up a cigarette(i know, i know)...it was a really nice sunny day out for January, as I stood there I happened  to glance at the sky above me and i noticed an object. MY first reaction to seeing this was, what the hell is that?  I looked around and during this whole event no one on the streets seemed to notice and i have never heard any mention of it since in the media or elsewhere. The best way to describe what i thought i was seeing was like how planets can appear real bright at sun-up or sun-down.  The only problem was that it was around 12:00 in the afternoon.  The sun is very bright in So. Cal. at 12 noon even during winter. This object did not move like what you think of in a zigzagging craft.  In fact, it moved rather slowly across the sky comparable to the moon's path across the sky that day which happened to be the only space object i could see that day.  Or, at least, it should have been the only thing i saw that day. This started to lead me to believe that it was a satellite. However, i have been to the desert at night and seen satellites with my own eyes. It appears to me that satellites move across the sky at a good pace.  Am I wrong? Anyways, i observed this craft or object or whatever for about 1 1/2 hrs.  During this time, i was able to go in and out of my house, watch t.v., go out and check on it again...and i took some pictures... What prompted me to write this was the reaction i got from friends and others when i showed them these images.  In the photos, you can see the bright object next to a cloud for perspective.  I have about 5 pictures of the object itself.  I also took a picture of the moon and an airplane during this time to give perspective on the object's shape. If this object is man-made my guess would be that it is a satellite with a shiny body and two dark panels on the side. The bright middle and dark sides is the characteristic shades/colors of this object.  My camera is only 3.2 megapixels, so i wish i had a more powerful camera that day.  Maybe it is a secret government spying satellite. I honestly have no idea what this object may be...but it is certainly open to debate.  I had never seen the object before and I never have since and it doesn't keep me awake at night.  just thought others might be interested in my observation. That's ma story and im stickin to it!

03/10/09 Two 2-foot-diameter bright white lighted circles dancing, each with one red light on the circle.;2009-03-10 21:55:00;5 minutes;03/10/09 Two 2-foot-diameter bright white lighted circles dancing, each with one red light on the circle. March 10, 2009 at 9:55 p.m. Two separate circles of bright white lights, each circle including one red light, were observed hovering over Big Canyon Drive at Burning Tree Road.  At times the white lights comprising the circles, measuring perhaps 2 feet in diameter each, blinked and occasionally each circle would seem to disappear for about 10 seconds and then reappear.  The circles appeared to dance in the sky and the display in its entirety lasted for about 5 minutes.  The circles then moved on, flying over the golf course and heading toward Fashion Island.
