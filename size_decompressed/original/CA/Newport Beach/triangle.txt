The craft approached from the sea, the west, and made a slight change on course to the northeast. From our position 100' south of the Newport Beach pier it looked like a giant F-117 (bigger than a football field). Triangular in shape and flying at about 4000' and 250mph. 5 lights on each leading edge of each wing like small stars, the body could have been translucid toward the back. It was totally silent. At that moment on such busy air space there was no other aircraft in sight, as if the airspace had been cleared for it to pass.. the object was as dark as the night sky, you could say it looked like a cutout of it. It just flew cruising along turning slightly to the left exposing its dark bottom and it could have been somewhat translucid. I fly private airplanes and are very familiar with all flying models I have never seen such a craft before;33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
Hovering black triangle with different colored lights- dropped vertically within 3-5 seconds.;2013-09-25 21:00:00;3 minutes;Hovering black triangle with different colored lights- dropped vertically within 3-5 seconds My sister and I were driving down to Newport Beach-Pelican Hill area on our regular beach drive – it was around 9pm PST.  There is a specific road that is perpendicular to PCH.  We were coming back from the beach towards where we live, towards inland.  On this particular road, the beach is behind you and there is a drop- huge valley on your right hand side and huge trees-blocking houses on the left hand side.  I was in the passenger seat and I immediately saw this black, huge triangular mass hovering over the side with the houses/trees.  It was hovering like I have never seen anything hover. It was huge in mass, cannot recall the exact size.  It was triangular and it had numerous lights on each side of the triangle- lights varying from red, green and blue.  The lights would alternate flashing.  Once I spotted this UFO, I immediately told my sister who was driving and also spotted it.  The strange thing about this UFO is that I could clearly make out the different co! lor lights but could not see the black mass- seemed like it was maybe “super black” or had some kind of invisible-ness.  It was hovering in the same position for about 1-2 minutes and as we were driving by, the black mass suddenly dropped vertically down into the unknown trees/houses.  I have never seen a flying unit drop vertically within 3-5 seconds of in the air.  I do have a drawing of the mass I drew when I got home.;33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
Triangular flying object with 3 white lights and 1 red light in middle, blinking in a pattern.;2015-01-13 18:30:00;5 minutes;Triangular flying object with 3 white lights and 1 red light in middle, blinking in a pattern. Was outside looking for the moon because my 20-month-old loves to say mooo and points up so we go out each night into the front or back yard to find it...  Tonight, it was not out yet but we were still looking because he was going mooo crazy... Anyhow, we went out front and it was pretty clear, could see many stars, including a few very high flying objects.  I assume they may have been satellites but one thing i saw had 3 white lights in a triangle shape, and one red light in the middle.  They would blink almost as if morse code, but couldn't really read it (even though I kind of know morse).  But there was a pattern in the lights.  I could not identify a shape because it was so high, but the fact that the triangle was so big and it was so high up, it must have been HUGE!  Anyhow, we went back inside to show my wife and when we went back out it was gone.;33.6239643292684;-117.886245121952
