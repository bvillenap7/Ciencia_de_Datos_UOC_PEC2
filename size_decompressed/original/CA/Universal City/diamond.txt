Universal Studios, CA Back Lot Tour  UFO Photo Hello,  My Family and I( Me, my Wife, and 3 boys ages 17,13, & 10) recently took a Vacation for a week in Southern California. We drove in from Texas and took countless photos of the scenic landscape of New Mexico, Arizona, and California. We visited Magic Mountain, Universal Studios, and many other sights around Southern California. Along the way in New Mexico we were taking several pictures , joking about capturing  UFO’s, of course because of Roswell.  When we were headed back to Texas looking at all our photos from 4 different cameras, my 13 yr old said “Dad look at this”, at first I said how did you do that, that’s a pretty real looking picture.  He took pictures with his Ipod during the trip.  He swore he did nothing to the photo and it is original. I got goosebumps because it was a creepy looking saucer in the upper center of the photo,  I was hoping to get clarity on what it may be.  Could it be an Airplane, bird, or is it an Unidentified Flying object. I won’t let him dele! te the photo until we have some clarity. It was taken during the Back lot tour at Universal Studios Hollywood on 7.31.2012. At approximately  8pm. Thank you for your time.;34.1379;-118.3619
