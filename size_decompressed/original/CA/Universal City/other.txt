Boomerang-shaped UFO materializes over Universal City.;2015-07-03 22:17:00;1-2 minutes;Boomerang-shaped UFO materializes over Universal City. The UFO sighting occurred in the Universal Studios theme park.  My party and I were on our way to exit the park and we used the escalators to enter the upper level.   We stopped on the third escalator pathway of the four in total to view the city skyline.  I used the app Snapchat to record a short clip of the skyline that I intended to post as my story.  I recorded the video and panned horizontally from left to right at a steady pace when afterward I came to realize I had caught something odd in the video.  I then proceeded to share with my family the anomaly that I had caught.  My cousin had also photographed the UFO in the picture attached in which it appeared to be hovering above the skyline motionless.  Soon after, the object was no longer in sight.  It was undetectable to the naked eye.  It was only captured with our electronic devices.  What I will point out is that the object does NOT come from the edge of the frame, it appears to materialize within ! the videos frame and move a different rate than my panning motion, therefore, I rule it out as being a mere reflection. It also does shift altitude for a brief moment.  The photograph was taken within 30 seconds after I had captured the video.  The object appears to closely resemble a boomerang.;34.1379;-118.3619
