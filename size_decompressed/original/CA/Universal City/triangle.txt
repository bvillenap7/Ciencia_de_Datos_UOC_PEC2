Two triangle shaped objects with lights on each end.;2003-06-07 01:00:00;30 sec.;Two triangle shaped objects with lights on each end. While at a party outside at Saddle Ranch at Universal City Walk, I first observed small flashing lights and looked over to a friend and asked What is that? and she said maybe some search lights, I said search lights doesn't look like that then as we were looking up into the sky we both observed 2 triangle shaped crafts that were identical to each other in size hovering in the sky flashing small beams of light back and forth as though they were playing tag with each other, when one would flash lights the other one would do the same thing.  We were standing there the whole time saying oh my god what is it, while we were looking up in the night sky watching these things other people starting looking up towards the sky saying this can't be real. This went on for about 30 seconds then both crafts slowed moved up into some clouds and disappeared.;34.1379;-118.3619
