It was mostly a sphere but a narrow band was around it. It was brightly metallic but had dark shadows on it. There was only one. It went over our heads and across the water, disappearing into the distance. It was moving fast, but I got a good look at it. It was fast, made no sound and it moved with kind of this weird wobble, kind of gently tilting. As it was directly over the water, there was a puff of white cloud or smoke around it which dissipated quickly then it moved very fast and I couldn't see it any more because it was moving into the distance. Even though I saw the saucer clearly over me, it moved fast. when I saw it moving into the distance, eventually it appeared as a single white dot. It seemed to bother the ducks. I am an artist. I can draw this.;39.1233;-122.8302
