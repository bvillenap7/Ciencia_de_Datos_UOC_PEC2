Strange helicopter craft on 101 near Los Alamos;2007-12-23 18:00:00;3 minutes;Strange helicopter craft on 101 near Los Alamos On the west side of 101, we observed a very bright light from the air highlighting a parked car and the surrounding area.   We then saw a helicopter-shaped craft move sporadically, accelerating very quickly from stationary to an estimated 200mph and then it flew in strange patterns.  We observed the light and the craft from the rear view window as it continued to drive south on 101.  Then the craft moved to the right side of the 101 and passed us to the right, going extremely fast with no lights on.
