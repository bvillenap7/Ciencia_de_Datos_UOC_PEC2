Bright lights near Vandenburg AFB;2018-08-11 22:20:00;15;Bright lights near Vandenburg AFB Approximately 22:00 I walked out front of my house to lock the cars. When I looked towards the west just through my neighbors oak tree I noticed some very bright lights. I walked into the road to get a better vantage of the lights. As I watched the light I noticed the lights seemed to be moving in a upward direction. The lights started as a few but seemed to just keep coming over the horizon. As I watched the lights move Upward I noticed they didn’t make any noise but were very bright. As the lights continued upward I called my father who lived down the block so he could confirm what I was witnessing. As I was one the phone with him, all the lights seemed to turn to the south “left from their direction of travel”. The speed of the lights seem to be very consistent. What really threw us off was when the first light made the turn it seemed to slow. It seemed to slow to wait the last light to make the turn. I noticed this because of my training in the army... a technique we used on convoys. We continued to watch and take pictures and video until the lights disappeared. We zoomed in on the pictures we took and realized the lights were actually grouped in threes.;34.7472;-120.2029
