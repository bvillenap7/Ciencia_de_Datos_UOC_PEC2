PD));2019-11-11 18:00:00;40 seconds;I saw a long straight string of moving lights flying south over playa vista. I saw a long string of lights which were in a perfectly straight line looked like they were connected in some way.  They were above the cloud level and I heard no engine noise so they must have been relatively high.  This would have meant that the string was very long.   They were moving  south across playa vista at a speed typical of an airplane.;33.9705;-118.4308
