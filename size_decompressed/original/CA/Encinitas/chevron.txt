Three light formation seen over San Diego night after SpaceX rocket;2017-12-23 21:30:00;15-20 seconds;Three light formation seen over San Diego night after SpaceX rocket Seen over Encinitas boulevard two blocks up the road from Moonlight State Beach.  First seen in the southeast corner of the sky, below Orion, but right of Sirius.  It moved northwest and after approximately 10 seconds faded from view.  It consisted of three white lights that appeared in a rigid formation like on the wingtips and nose of a chevron-shaped craft.  No body was visible between the lights, even as they passed in front of a moonlit cloud.  The motion of the lights seemed to suggest that the craft was relatively close to the ground, within drone flight range.  If it was as close as it appeared to be, the wingspan would be well over 20 feet.  It was also completely silent and was definitely close enough to have been heard if it was a drone or an airplane.  It moved at a constant speed, fairly quickly, but slower than an airplane would be at that distance. This also happened just over 24 hours after SpaceX launched a test rocket over San Diego, which many reported as a UFO.;33.0562;-117.2688
