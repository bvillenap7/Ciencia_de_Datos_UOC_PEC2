More than 23 objects at 5 am.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-15 05:00:00;15 minutes;More than 23 objects at 5 am. At 5 am, it was still dark.  I looked up and from the northwest, traveling southeast I saw what I thought was a satellite.  the more I watched I noticed another behind it, then another and another.  I stopped counting at 23. there were more but the sun was rising and they got harder to see.  There stayed almost the same distance apart. I saw no navigation lights, there no sound. I could not tell the altitude although it was lower than a satellite as I saw a satellite pass above them.  it was moving south to north. the objects were bigger. I noticed another posting on 4/9/20 stating a similar appearance. Although I saw more of them than in the post from 4/9/20, it sounds like the same encounter.;33.0562;-117.2688
