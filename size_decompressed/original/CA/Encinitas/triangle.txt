triangle of lights fly over Swami's point in the evening;2011-01-28 20:45:00;20 seconds;triangle of lights fly over Swami's point in the evening Looking up at a 45 degree angle on the stars I saw 3 moving in parallel across the sky.  They were in pretty much an equilateral  triangle shape.  It went  right over Swami’s Point surf spot paraellling the coastline which is pretty much due north.  I see many planes and choppers fly over this path at apparently the same height & speed  during  the day and  at night so I know this well visually and sonically.  The height & speed seemed about the same. ~100MPH about 100ft over the cliff top & 100ft out from the cliff or 150ft above the ocean so the path is actually  over  the surf zone.  It was very quiet at the time and at this close distance or even if it was much further away and much larger it would be easily audible if it were a plane, or copper (there would also be running lights and the aircraft would be somewhat visible even with all lights out.  The triangle was about visually the size of my fist at full arms’ extension.  If it were 150 feet from me ! (I was about 100ft from the cliff edge) I’d guesstimate that it was roughly 50 ft on each edge of the triangle.  There were patchy clouds from the receding storm about 1,500 feet I’d guess and this thing was clearly below this.  If it was actually at 600 ft then it would be about 600 feet out from the cliff and would be dramatically larger (hundreds of feet on each side of the triangle. The lights were quite dim, about the same as a common star with no flashing or special color (just white).  There were no other lights on it and just a very subtle darkening between the lights.  Again, it made absolutely no sound.  This object would not be easy to notice even at this close distance and if it were much higher it could fly unnoticed over anywhere.;33.0562;-117.2688

It was composed of three bright white lights, and passed through a ~170° field of view in about 45 seconds.  The vehicle moved much like a satellite, completely silent until it passed out of my field of view, when a loud noise similar to an afterburning engine like a J79 experiencing some kind of minor malfunction occurred, lasting 15 seconds.;33.0562;-117.2688
