huge bright object dropping toward the ocean or horizon?;2002-05-22 23:00:00;1.5 seconds;huge bright object dropping toward the ocean or horizon? i was in our living room, which has a view of the pacific, and glanced out the sliding glass doors as a very bright flash shaped like a wide diamond plummetted extremely fast toward the water!  it was either really huge or really close.  i yelled out did any of my roommates just see that?, and our friend who was visiting said it was totally strange because his roommate (two doors down/ ocean view again) had seen the same thing the night before!  wow!  it happened so fast!  it was so bright like blueish brilliant white.  the shape is hard to explain, wide but pointed up and down (diamond?).  it seemed like there were spaces at the top and bottom... like slices of emptyness.  at work yesterday morning, i told my coworkers, and apparently my very respectable boss saw it as well! we agreed it was no shooting star.;33.0562;-117.2688
