On beach north of San Diego, a multi-color light cluster appears in southern sky, strobing, drifting silently east.;2005-06-22 23:30:00;15 min.;On beach north of San Diego, a multi-color light cluster appears in southern sky, strobing, drifting silently east. Myself and four other friends where sitting/lying on the beach sand. The sky was partly cloudy, perhaps 30% clouds dispersed. Stars shown and the full moon rising, no wind, temperature in upper 60's/lower 70's (F). Southwest facing beach. A tight cluster of lights appears in the southern sky, low altitude, moving from west to east. four or five distinct pinpoint lights, all different colors: blue, green, red, yellow... blinking/pulsing.... the cluster drifting east, erradic course jogging up a little then down a little, always moving east. The rapid strobing lights forcing my mind into non-thinking trance state. I knew at the time that this was an intelligent occurance, that it was for transmittion to me(if not others). After a few miniutes the cluster suddenly vanishes. I then look up at the night sky and see that wherever I look, tiny strobing pinpoint lights flash at me. I keep looking in different sectors of sky and see this same responce. As soon as I look, they flash at me, when I look away, they stop. This second phase lasts 10 to 15 min. then the sky quickly fills in with clouds. Two of my freinds, I was able to direct their attention and they saw this first phase. The other two friends where occupied. no sounds where heard.;33.0562;-117.2688
08/12/2011 viewed eight lights and the next night at same time one light.;2011-08-12 21:00:00;7 minutes;08/12/2011 viewed eight lights and the next night at same time one light. 8/13/2011  On 08/12/2011 9:00pm. W Walking south on Neptune Ave in Encinitas, Ca we observed two bright lights and one or three tiny lights in the sky at about 15 to 20 degrees up from the horizon.  I later discerned with a compass we were looking 310 degrees south east.  The two main lights were very close to each other and not moving or making any sound. The small lighst were moving up toward the other two. Eventually the small lights vanished one at a time, then the left light of the pair of stationery lights began to grow dim and eventually dimish but this time I noticed it seemed to be traveling in a straight line away from my line of sight so there was no perception of it moving in any other direction but just getting tiny going straight away from me and finally disappearing. As we were observing the behavior of these five ufos two more very bright ones were approaching from the south paired togerher as if hugging the coast line.  The spacing of them and intensity was the same as the first bright pair.  As they approached  a position in a line under the first pair but they the lower slowly ascended toward the position of the first two. Then the top two  began to flicker dim and then move straight away from my eye line like the others.  First it was the left one then the right. Then the two new lights rose up and took the same positions as the earlier two.  At his time another pair just like the last pair appeared coming up the coast from the south.  And repeated the behavior of the last two.  Within the span of ten to fifteen minutes they were all gone. I shot video of the event with my phone and you can see the pair of lights and hear the commentary of myself and 5 or 6 other witnesses on the street. My impression of the event was that I was observing an airport runway with planes queing up for take off. The lights looked very similar to videos of the very well documented sightings in Arizona. Orangish yellow. 08/13/2011 9:10pm. We went to the same sight as the night before at 9:00 to see if the ufos appeared there again. It was more overcast then the night before. Nothing. But as we were leaving about 9:10 a single light appeared moving up from the south again, took the same position as the others did the night before, hung there for the same amount of time and then diminished and disappeared the same as the others had the night before. I shot video again of this ufo. There was no sound at all;33.0562;-117.2688
Two orange orbs 200 ft away, disappear into thin air.;2011-10-29 22:00:00;30 seconds;Two orange orbs 200 ft away, dissapeer into thin air. Literally discussing whether ufos existe or not with a colleague while observing the stars (colleague is or was a major skeptic, but i know were not Alone!).   A few minutes past and i notice 2 glowing orange orbes traveling in a sort of formation from southeast to northwest.  We thought Maybe they were justa couple navy jets far off in the distance,  which made them look like flying lights.  But then, as they were moving along just over the treetops, there was one tree that was much taller than the rest.  My eyes,  expecting to lose them once they moved behind this large tree were amazed when they passed in front of the tree.  They were just a couple hundred rest away, made no noise, i didnt notice any sort of structure or mechanisms, it was just the 2 fiery orange orbes in syncronized flight!  Then starting ascending a little bit, when all the sudden they just vanished.  It was like they realized we were looking at them, and so they just hit the invisibility button and vanished!;33.0562;-117.2688

White slow moving light leaves a glowing green trail low over Leucadia.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;2 minutes;White slow moving light leaves a glowing green trail low over Leucadia A star-like light began to glow with intensity as it slowly moved directly over the coast at Leucadia, at the northern end of Encinitas at around 6:00pm, at what appeared to be about 1000 feet. It moved slowly north and the light lost intensity over a period of a minute or two. As it moved the light left a green glowing trail where it had gained intensity. As it moved it faded into the fog.

Fast-moving Light Cruising the Pacific Coast;2020-10-13 23:00:00;10 seconds;Fast-moving Light Cruising the Pacific Coast While walking to my car at approximately 11:00 PM this last Tuesday (10/13), my girlfriend and I witnessed a very high-speed, reddish light going North to South along the Pacific coast. The light was rather dim, almost like seeing a fainter satellite traveling across the sky, but with a red tinge to it and traveling much faster than any satellite I have ever witnessed. I could not tell if it was something in the atmosphere like an aircraft or something in orbit like a satellite, but it had no discernible beacons or navigation lights like an aircraft and moved in a straight line for the 10 seconds or so that we witnessed it.;33.0562;-117.2688
