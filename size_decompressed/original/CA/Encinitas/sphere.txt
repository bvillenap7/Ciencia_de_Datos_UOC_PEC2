solid reddish orb, no lights 100 feet up and northbound at about 30mph.;2009-04-15 21:09:00;5 - 7 seconds;solid reddish orb, no lights 100 feet up and northbound at about 30mph. saw sphere with solid red exterior hover silently and fast northbound. I was sitting in the dark with my wife outside and my eye caught the gleam of street lights reflecting off of the sphere. It was approximately 100 feet from the ground and had no lights of any kind.  I would say it was a balloon, but it was moving at about 30 miles an hour in a straight line north while the wind was blowing perpendicularly from the east.

Two low bright lights hovering/moving back and forth off the 5 in Encinitas 3:15 am.;2014-04-13 03:15:00;30 minutes;Two low bright lights hovering / moving back and forth off the 5 in Encinitas 3:15am Traveling down the 5 heading south at three in the morning.  There was overcast so there were no stars out. I noticed two orbs of light twinkling.  They seemed rather close so I took the next exit and worked my way back to them. As soon as they were visible I parked on the side of the road next to Scripps Memorial Hospital (never been in this area so it was the only landmark I noticed).  I watched them glide back and forth and decided to get a closer look.  At the intersection of Melba and San Dieguito I parked and the pure white lights were directly above me... not positive how high but not terribly high....  They gave off a solid color but would grow brighter...pulsing, never going dim.  After losing my nerve I retreated to the memorial parking lot where I watched them until they flew away. These lights were not moving as an aircraft does, nor did they make a sound like a helicopter (or any sound for that matter).   After I couldn't see them from the parking lot I went back to the intersection amd got a glimpse of them going further out towards the ocean.  That was the last I saw of them.
