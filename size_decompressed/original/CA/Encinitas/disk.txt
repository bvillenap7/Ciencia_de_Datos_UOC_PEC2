7-photo sequence of flying object, Encinitas CA Jan 10 2007;2007-01-10 17:27:00;approx. 10 seconds;7-photo sequence of flying object, Encinitas CA Jan 10 2007 I was photographing the ocean sunset when I saw the object approaching. I pointed my camera (an 8 megapixel digital) at the object and took a sequence of seven photographs. One image in the sequence shows a red light. When I loaded the images into my computer and saw them on the screen, I noticed that the light is not blurred by motion. This would indicate to me that the object I photographed is not blurred by motion. The images show that the object was not a helicopter or an airplane. (It made no audible sound). And, as far as I'm aware, cruise missiles (and other flying objects of that type) are not equipped with lights.;33.0562;-117.2688
