Five or six soundless lights on airship seen moving from east to west  in foothills of Californ ia;1990-06-30 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Five or six soundless lights on airship seen moving from east to west  in foothills of Californ ia My wife and I were out in front of our house, lying on the grass, looking at the stars with two of our neighbors.  The stars began to disappear behind some object.  There was no sound.   The shape, as determined by the disappearing stars, was like a triangle with two booms (like the old P-38) off the ends.   At first, we thought it was just some kind of low-flying aircraft, but, with no sound, we decided that it might be flying very high.  If so, it had to be enormous.  We did not report it because we felt people would think we were nuts. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));37.2172;-119.5173
