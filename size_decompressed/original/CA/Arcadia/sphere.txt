PD));2008-11-07 23:30:00;30 mins;A bright sphere rapidly changing color - blue, green and red, in one spot. I and my son saw a large spherical object, very bright and changing color from green to blue to red, and standing in one spot over the south-west horizon.  Even with our powerful binoculars and a reflecting telescope we could not make out any details, other than it was a sphere emitting a very bright light and constantly changing colors.
