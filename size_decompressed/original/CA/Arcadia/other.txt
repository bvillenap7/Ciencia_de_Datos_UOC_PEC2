Traveling east bound on 210 fwy, between Rosemead Blvd/Myrtle Ave exits.  I saw only 4 white streaks traveling east from the coast to the mountain side of Los Angeles County.  Just before my exit on Myrtle, there were 5 white streaks now.   I checked YouTube and other websites and nobody posted anything.  They were there and traveling fast.  They weren't jets, there wasn't a white smoke line being left behind like jets leave.  Weird but true.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
