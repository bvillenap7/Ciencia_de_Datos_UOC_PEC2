Silent, craft flying at an average speed with lights in a triangular pattern.;2002-01-12 21:34:00;About two seconds;Silent, craft flying at an average speed with lights in a triangular pattern. It was dark, so all I was able to see were lights. Arrayed in a triangle, there were about 4 on each side. The lights were basically the color of a normal lightbulb. It was at a pretty low altitude, heading Southwest. Not too fast, did'nt make a sound. It caught my attention because it matched previous descriptions I had heard. I was the only 'observer'.

Triangular craft, three distinct white lights on each corner, high altitude, moved silently and swiftly and like a swaying glider.;2007-11-14 20:30:00;10 seconds;Triangular craft, three distinct white lights on each corner, high altitude, moved silently and swiftly and like a swaying glider. At approximately 20:30 I witnessed a black, triangular craft moving very silently and smoothly over Monterey Peninsula College in Monterey, California.  It had 3 distinct and steady white lights at the tip of each corner and seemed to be at a high altitude. 	Its movement was almost like that of a glider, and it was traveling in a semi-linear path due north-east. The linear movement was characterized by a sort of zig-zag swaying from side to side. It was approximately an inch long on all sides to the naked eye. It looked to be very, very large, maybe 300 feet or so. 	I witnessed it for approximately 10 seconds before it was out of sight, trailing off in the same strange motion it had displayed again, like that of a glider.  It was alarming and caught me off guard. 	Later that night a friend and I witnessed what seemed to be 4 (maybe 6) orbs over the course of an hour.  They were golden-orange in color and pulsated.  They moved erratically, descending, ascending, stopping, and changing direction. They persisted for approximately 45 minutes. They pulsated, changing in brightness, even disappearing and reappearing, though this might have been due to a fog layer across Monterey Bay.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
