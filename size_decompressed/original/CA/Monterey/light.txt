You can see UFOs with third generation night vision goggles 95% of the time.;2008-04-16 21:00:00;3 hours plus;You can see UFOs with third generation night vision goggles 95% of the time. We were with ____________ at the Best Western Monterey Bay Beach Resort Hotel looking at the night sky with 3rd generation night vision goggles.  We had a group of 15 to 20 people on the nights of Tuesday 4/15/08 and Wensday 4/16/08 and saw multiple sightings including a double explosion of an object that was approached by another ship that then darted away in a different direction. The bottom line is that you can witness this stuff nearly every night using  night vision goggles.  Please feel free to give out my personal information and contact information anytime.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
Bright, yellow sphere of light streaks and shifts (manuevers) across sky then suddenly disappears.;2009-11-14 20:36:00;10 seconds;Bright, yellow sphere of light streaks and shifts (manuevers) across sky then suddenly disappears. I was standing outside of my house tonight - a fog-free, clear night with no planes in the sky - and saw something that could not be confused with either a plane or a meteor (shooting star).  This was a small ball of light that was bright yellow in color, completely different in shape and color from any star in the sky that I've ever seen. It quickly appeared and shot across the sky over a military installation behind my house.  However, the path was unlike anything I've seen too.  It shot quickly in a straight line, then moved to the left, then continued going straight again for a few seconds until it suddenly disappeared.  No plane could move that quickly, nor could it shift to the left like that.  No shooting star could do that either.  I don't know what it was, but it was so bright and unlike anything in the sky that I couldn't take my eyes off of it.  The movement was simply impossible for a plane or star - nothing moves that fast, then shifts to the le! ft that fast, then shifts straight again with no real turn or pause.  It disappeared completely without warning.  Nothing else is in the sky to obstruct my view or confuse my eyes.  I was completely frozen, standing in my driveway, watching this.  What could it be?;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954

Wife and I observed three bright dot s of light, green, blue and red moving erraticly over Monterey Bay.;2010-03-28 21:30:00;20 min;Wife and I observed three bright dot s of light, green, blue and red moving erraticly over Monterey Bay. Was observing and aircraft coming in for a landing in Monterey when I observed  a bright green light (dot) moving from ocean toward Monterey, Ca. along the same flight path, it then moved well below the flight path very quickly. Light changed to bright white, blinked out and changed back to green. It moved back to where first observed, then moved up and down. Very erratic pattern for aircraft. Was followed, after three minutes, by a bright red light, moving in similar pattern. And then a Bright blue light observed moving back and forth into and out of bay. Blue and Green lights departed area around 9:45 pm, traveling same direction toward horizon and disappeared. Red light not observed departing area. Observation was from back yard in Seaside looking toward Monterey Peninsula over the bay and out to sea. Some trees obscured portions of the flights.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
Two brilliant blue and green lights that were observed for about 15 mins. that moved in an erratic fashion independent of each other.;2010-06-27 23:12:00;20 min.;Two brilliant blue and green lights that were observed for about 15 mins. that moved in an erratic fashion independent of each other. At 11:12 PM on the 28th of June I received a phone call on my cell from my brother who lives about 4 miles from my location.  He wanted me to go outside and see if I could observe the lights he was looking at north of his location and close to the horizon.  I immediately went outside and looked in the direction he had indicated and was able to see a faint green light just above the horizon northeast of me which appeared to be somewhere near the direction of Ft Ord.  I told him to grab his digital video camera and film what we were seeing.  I immediately went inside and grabbed some binoculars and was able to distinguish a brilliant green light moving erratically near the horizon.  The light would move in an approximately east to west direction at a slow pace, randomly stop and hover then move again in spurts and change direction very rapidly.  It took about 5 minutes for me to locate the other light, which was blue in color, and I was able to observe both lights moving independent of each other.  The blue light would periodically disappear and then come back into view.  Generally it would appear as if the blue light would take off vertically and disappear behind the cloud cover.  At other times my view of the blue light was obscured by intervening trees. The blue light eventually disappeared from my view even though my brother did indicate that he could still see it.  At no time did I observe any navigational lights that would indicate that either of these objects were some kind of aircraft.  The movement also was unlike any aircraft that I have observed in the past.  After about 15 minuets the lights disappeared altogether.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954

It looked like maybe two rockets heading away but they didnâ€™t last. It was to quick to be a rocket  flash. It was very odd. 7/28/2021 9:00 pm looking south west over the ocean;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
