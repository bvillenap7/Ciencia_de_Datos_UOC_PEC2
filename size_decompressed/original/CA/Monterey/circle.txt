Circular blue object traveling east to west over Central California Coast.;2003-04-12 22:05:00;10 seconds;Circular blue object traveling east to west over Central California Coast. I am a chef working in Monterey CA.  At approximately 10:05 p.m.  I had stepped outside to take a break after completing a party.  I look up at the night sky and saw an incandecent blue, circular object moving from east to west.  I cannot say what size it was or at what altitude it flew, but if you were to hold a quarter at arms length, that would be approximately the size of the object against the sky.  As for the altitude somewhere above the cumulus clouds and below the cirrus clouds.  The object completely dissappeared behind the cumulus clouds.  There was no sound accompanying the object, nor was there any trail or tail that might indicate a meteor or shooting star. ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS)) Circular blue object traveling east to west over Central California Coast. I am a chef working in Monterey, Ca.  At approximatly 10:05 p.m. I was outside taking a break after completing a party.  I looked up at the night sky and saw an incandecent blue, circular object moving east to west.  I cannot guess the size or at what altitude it flew, but if you were to hold a quarter at arms length that would approximate the size of the object against the sky.  As for the altitude, I can safely say that it flew above the height of cumulus clouds and below the height of cirrus clouds because the light completely dissappeared behind the cumulus clouds.  There was no sound accompanying it, nor was there any tail or trail that might indicate a meteor or shooting star. ((END));36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
Red light in sky, looked with binoculars and saw reddish white circle with perfectly positioned white lights and lace-like structure.;2014-03-27 22:00:00;Ongoing;Red light in sky, looked with binoculars and saw reddish white circle with perfectly positioned white lights and lace-like structure.   Maybe too big for a craft of some kind but not a star or aircraft.   It is just sitting in the sky!?;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
Round, silent, red and green ufo spotted hovering for seven minutes.;2014-07-23 21:45:00;7 minutes;Round, silent, red and green ufo spotted hovering for seven minutes My friend called me outside and we could see a round object hovering in the sky.  It was green and red.  There was no sound, no trail, no glow around it like a street or car light, no blinking lights... it hovered for about six or seven minutes then started moving away to the left and disappeared.   Being prior service military, I know it was not a radio controlled helicopter... I've never seen anything like thisâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with both witnesses, husband and wife, and they seemed to us to be quite serious-minded and sincere in their decription of the sighting.
