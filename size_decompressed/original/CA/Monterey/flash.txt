Moving orange lights and a bright flashing light very close to ground.;2011-12-05 22:00:00;45 mins;Moving orange lights and a bright flashing light very close to ground. We were standing on the top floor of our hotel balcony when we noticed a bunch of orange lights in the distant sky switching places, disappearing, and reappearing in different spots.  One which we had kept our eye on for about an hour started floating slowly to the west.  It changed pace, stopped, then started coming our way.  It came toward us rapidly, flying above out balcony, creating wind in the trees and the pool.  My boyfriend decided to go out to the car to get our camera when I heard him yell for me. I went out back and saw a big bright flashing white light on top of the trees across the street.  The light lit up the trees, the street, and the house next door.  The light got dimmer, then brighter again, and went on for about 45 minutes. It disappeared out of no where.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
While videoing at the Orion area I saw some large flashing lights don't no what they are. No airplanes!;2013-01-31 22:00:00;25 minutes;While videoing at the Orion area I saw some large flashing lights don't no what they are. No airplanes! In the Orion area on January 31 2013 about 10pm.  while videoing the area for about 25 minutes I notices a flash of light as big as two starts. At first I thought it was an airplane just going by?  I wasn’t able to see anything just by looking around trying to fine the airplane then another flash!  As I’m looking at my video viewfinder I see more flashing lights some seem to be bigger than others not sure what’s going on. My video was set at 60 zoom looking at the Orion to the right upper area of the stars.  Could the military testing nukes in outer space?  Not sure maybe lots of colliding rocks exploding? It seem to be somewhat apart from each other that could be thousands of miles away?…….Anyone out there may no what this is or what could be going on…will try to down load the video it’s about 20 minutes long. Have lots of videos I just been holding back to see if any others had video the same thing………….Mufon give me a call soon……. You should have on file my other reports....thank you for your time.
