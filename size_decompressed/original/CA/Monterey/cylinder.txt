Cigar shaped UFO over Monterey, CA October 24, 2007;2007-10-25 20:30:00;5 minutes;Cigar shaped UFO over Monterey, CA October 24, 2007 As I was driving my car on the highway, I saw the First U.F.O. was triangular shaped with 3 bright lights defining the points. The lights seems to converge closer together, or the ufo was moving away, it hovered west toward the ocean, then disappeared over the ocean.  The second I saw a few  miles farther up, about a minute later. First it seemed to consist of a few bright lights like the first, it was hovering, I watched it move slowly above the freeway, but suddenly the bright white lights turned off, and there were two lights at the end points of this cigar shaped object, one red, one blue, it seemed to get bigger, or closer, it was moving slowly then it was out of my field of view.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
two lights with a glow around them twenty feet in front of a car;2012-06-27 03:25:00;2-3 min.;two lights with a glow around them twenty feet in front of a car I work nights at a collage and we get off work at 4:30 in the morning, at 3:20 on wed. morning I walk out of our main office building and my buddy that I work with pulls up in his car and stops, his headlights are on he rolls down the passener window and we start talking. A minute later he says what is that? I say where? he says in front of the car, and about twenty feet in front of the car were two lights shaped like two cylinders about three inches long with a glow around them and one on top of the other with about two inches between them. I start walking towards them with my arm outstrethed trying to touch them the lights did not move they were completely still until I seemed to get too close and they disapeared and in a blink of an eye and they were ten feet away. I walked towards them again trying to touch them and they disapeared again and were ten feet away again. My buddy got out of the car and laughed and said, it must be a reflection off of my glas! ses, and I said but I can see them too and in a blink of an eye they were off onto the drivers side of the car and in a flash they were in front of us again and in a blink of an eye they were off on the drivers side of the car again and then they were gone. I know this was not a bug or insect because bugs and insects are not in two pieces, they do not light up and stay motionless they fly, not disapear and reappear ten feet away. The only thing I have ever seen that moves as fast as these things did is a hummingbird and this was not a bird, a hummingbird will move even while staying in one place and they are not in two pieces and they do not light up. I don't know if this was a small UFO but, I have never seem anything as strange or move as fast as these things did. When you looked at these lights you were mesmerized you could not take your eyes off of them, they looked like a hologram but they were very real.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954

Ball lightning in California, time gateway, heavenly orb.;2017-07-15 20:18:00;2:00 minutes;Ball lightning in California, time gateway, heavenly orb. The children and I went to the San Carlos beach in Monterey during sunset  we were playing with the sand and taking pictures we uncovered a lobster in the sand that was orange in color as if baked but it was alive, at the moment I didn’t think of the color of the lobster, my son asked me what is that in the sky?  pointing to a big light ball as if it’s an open orb or tunnel that was 200 meters far.  My son said that is heaven, I said as I stood mesmerized that this is grandparents watching over us.  I was mesmerized that even me a communication professor that loves media and has been taking pictures of everything small or big I was able to snap one single picture only, but it was so beautiful that I believe it is my diamond star picture. I took the kids afterwards for a small walk took some pictures and walked to the car and home contemplating to what I saw. Ever since I feel I have a mission that is heavier than me, but God keeps sending me helping signs. It is heaven.  And yes, God is everywhere.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
