Just about three miles before the entrance to Ft Ord I saw a large long rectangular silver object off to the left over the ocean. It seemed to be just hovering in one spot and I thought it might just seem that way cause it could have been traveling in the same direction I was. The sky was partially hazy and partially cloudy. I thought I was seeing  things as I went past the main entrance to the Fort I was almost parrallel to it and I could see no rotors or wings...It looked like a large bus just floating in the sky. Then it began to turn in my direction and I could see it was almost as wide as it was high. Now I could deffinalely see it starting to move...slowely across my path almost directly overhead but the haze prevented a clear view. It continued over Ft Ord just as I turned into the 12th street entrance to same. I expected to be able to follow it but it went behind a lone cloud in that part of the sky and dissappered cause it was not here as i finally came arount that cloud. I thought it might have actually come down and landed somewhere on Ft Ord. It might have been about three times longer than a 747 and 20% of its lenght in height and about 15% in width with a flat front and a flat back. Silver colored.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
