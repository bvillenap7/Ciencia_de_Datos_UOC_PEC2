The object was either stationary or moving very slowly as it appeared to just be hovering.   I immediately realized it was not a plane or helicopter, and I thought the only man-made thing it could possibly be was a blimp even though it was more disc shaped.   I reached for my camera phone, but the object became obstructed by a row of trees as I drove.  When I passed the trees about 4 seconds later the object was gone.   At this point I had a clear view of the Bay including the water and the object was nowhere to be seen.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
