March 13, 1997 Monterey, CA UFO incident;1997-03-13 21:30:00;3-5 minutes;March 13, 1997 Monterey, CA UFO incident If you recall there was footage of orange lights over one of Arizona's cities. I believe it was Phoenix.  Anyways the orange lights all appeared in a line across the city.  After the ordeal the military came out with there own statement saying they were flares I believe. The ufo footage was taken by a gentleman from his house. Amazing as it may seem I saw the same colored lights that night in Monterey, CA. It was around 9:30 pm. On my way back home from class I was driving east on Highway 68 near the Monterey Airport.  The night was clear with no moon.  While looking off to the southeast I saw what appeared to be two stars of orange color. However, they were moving together at a fixed speed while I was driving. I lossed them for a few seconds in the trees and then there was only one.  As I drove further passed the airport the orange light kept on a straight path at a moderate speed. It looked like the UFO was flying at the speed of a small plane.  While driving about a mile east of the airport I was right under the UFO. The light did not change course nor was it landing at the Monterey Airport. It kept right on its path going north-northwest of the airport. Now you are wondering why this is interesting and if there is any truth to this. Well one interesting clue about the UFO is the lights. The UFO did not depict the normal aircraft light pattern on an airplane. No wingtip lights were visible or flashing. Nor was there any headlights visible through the entire experience. The object(s) were a round soft orange color. They looked so much like a star at first that you could have easily assumed they were. Another thing when I drove under the object it still was orange all the way around. Still no wingtip lights were visible.  In addition, normally when an aircraft passes you at night it should be dark from the rear since the headlights are pointed in the direction of flight. Anyone think this is not a normal aircraft?;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
Yellowish sphere traveling at high speed with sudden sharp and well defined course changes;2006-11-08 18:35:00;Apx. 1 Minute;Yellowish sphere traveling at high speed with sudden sharp and well defined course changes My brother in law and I were on a walk between downtown Monterey and a forested park. He gave me a jab and was pointing into the sky. The object he was pointing at appeared to be a little larger than a satellite appears and had a slightly fuzzy yellow light to it. I actually thought it was a satellite until it made a sudden jag from its North/Northeast line of travel to a Northern one. Apx. 10 more seconds into its flight it made a sudden Northwestern zig, maintained this for apx. 5-10 seconds and then made a sharp zig back to the North path again. It was completely silent and it was difficult to determine its height and/or size. Our best estimate is that it was at least 10,000 feet up and probably traveling in the 1,000 mph speed range. My brother in law had already observed it zigging from a Northern course to the Northeasterly path it was on when I first saw it. My brother in law has a hobby of astral photography (time lapse galaxy etc. photos) and I'm pretty familiar with the typical satellite or shooting star, but this was none of those, I'm certain. I have never seen anything manuever like this did with its sharp and linear course changes and speed.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
