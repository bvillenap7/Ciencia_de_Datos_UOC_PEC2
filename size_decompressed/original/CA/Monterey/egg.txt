Metallic egg-shaped object over the ocean;2012-03-16 12:00:00;unknown;metallic egg-shaped object over the ocean I was taking pictures of the ocean in Monterey on March 16 at around 12pm.  It was stormy out and had recently been raining. I didn't notice anything unusual at the time I was taking pictures.  When I looked at the photos later, I noticed a strange dot in the sky in one of the photos.  When I zoomed in I could see a strange metallic egg-shaped object.  I've never seen anything like this and would like to know what it is.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
