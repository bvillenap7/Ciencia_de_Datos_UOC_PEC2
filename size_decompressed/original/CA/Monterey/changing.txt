The outer portion changed direction and drifting downward, towards the water with the WHITE center always intact.   As the object appeared it shifted from a side angle view to a full frontal view appearing like a jelly fish with a white center.   As it approached the water line, the RED outer portion disappeared and the white center then briefly touched the water and jumped up and dashed quickly off to the right. This was witnessed upon review of the camera footage, not with the naked eye.  There was nothing behind me that would cause a glare, I was filming from the back deck of the Best Western Hotel, 2nd floor ...  Retired Special Agent US GOV;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
Multiple UFOs sighted, heard hums, lights flashing/blinking/colors changing, moved rapidly/bounced multiple directions. Cloudy NO stars;2017-09-27 01:00:00;Until dusk;Multiple UFOs sighted, heard hums, lights flashing/blinking/colors changing, moved rapidly/bounced multiple directions. Cloudy NO stars For 2 nights, starting 9/23 around 9:30pm, I saw a white spherical light on the horizon of NorthWest mountains.  Strange large lights would fly above this larger light, and they flashed red, white, blue, and moved far too quickly in a bouncing motion to be an airplane.  Living close to the airport I disregarded sightings until 9/25 about 10pm I noticed the larger light was no longer white but orange and had moved farther North.  Same colored and shaped smaller lights continued to randomly hover in sparadic movements near orange light, until eventually speeding off in whatever directions or disappearing.  9/27 1am I see that large orange light is moving in circle formation and can also see an odd rectangular shape to light, or at a certain angle seemed like 2 lights determining shape to still be rectangular.  I have also noticed that orange light has rocket some small white light from top of light, and moving like a missle (straight in sky) has also left some sort! of chem trail looking cloud for a considerable distance about 5 seconds. At 3:55am I became uncomfortable and sit in a chair on the opposite side of the window, and notice a floating green, white, and blue light that was quickly spinning and moving sporadically different directions. 4:08 green light has now moved South West toward my home in a bobbing or jumping formation.  Light continues to weave forward and backward as if trying to hide behind clouds.  4:15am light is stationary every time I look at it, but within 2 secs begins to climb sky in much too fast a speed to be anything considered average.  These occurrences are extremely frequent here, and I have spotted them on average 6:7 times per week since 2014 along with many other different descriptions.  I can occasionally hear strange humming noise as well when lights come close enough, unlike any aircraft I have heard before.  9/27 absolutely zero stars out due to cloudy and overcast night.;36.589061627907;-121.862505813954
