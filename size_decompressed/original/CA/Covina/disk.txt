Gray, saucer-shaped object spotted near Covina.;2010-09-02 21:30:00;10 seconds;Gray, saucer-shaped object spotted near Covina. At around 9:30 pm on September 2nd, 2010, my friends and I came back from a football game and were waiting at the front of our school for our parents to pick us up.  We were talking and joking around when suddenly my friend sitting next to me yells, U.F.O!!! and points northeast.  Instinctively, we all looked in that direction.  And there, against a clear, pitch-black sky, one gray, saucer-shaped object was moving right to left at a relatively fair speed.  It was obviously too fast to be a cloud and it was almost a complete impossiblity as there were no other clouds in the sky.  We shouted and yelled oh my god! in disbelief as it got smaller and smaller.  The object was only visible for about ten seconds until it disappeared.;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
