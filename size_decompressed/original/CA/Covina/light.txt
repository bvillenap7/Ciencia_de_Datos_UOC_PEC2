HE TOLD MY SISTER AND I TO LOOK UP, WHERE WE ALSO THE THE OBJECT.  THE OBJECT WAS VERY HIGH AND WAS TRAVELLING AT A GREAT RATE OF SPEED.  WE WERE IN AWE BECAUSE WE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT, WE HAVE SEEN SATALITES, BUT NEVER AN OBJECT WITH A REDDISH HUE. ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER, I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A SATALITE, TRAVELLING FROM NORTH TO THE EAST.  MY BROTHER IN LAW SAID THAT IT WAS NOT JUST ONE SATALITE, THAT IT WAS THREE.  UPON FOCUSING MY VISION, I SAW THE THREE OBJECTS, ONE OF WHICH WAS WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A SATALITE.  THE OBJECTS WERE TRAVELLING AT THE SAME RATE OF SPEED IN A TRIANGLE FORMATION.  THEY WERE A FINGER LENGTH SPACED APART, AT ARMS LENGTH. WOW, WHAT A NIGHT...;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
Orange light moving south in the northeast sky.;2007-05-10 01:00:00;10 mins;Orange light moving south in the northeast sky. An orange light moving 2 times slower than the air planes. In the northeast sky, moving south. It moved very slow I thought it was a star until i noticed how far it moved. the light moved down and then up, at the same speed of a plane. I called my girlfriend to come and look at to prove i wasn't crazy. We both watched the light continue south and then the light dimmed out like if it left real fast.;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
Solid orange light appears near Covina, ca.;2009-12-31 23:45:00;8 min;Solid orange light appears near Covina, ca. My fianc√© and I were in our backyard 10 minutes before the stroke of midnight of the new 2010 new year.  We were looking up at the sky because the moon was full and bright. We were facing south and we saw this orangish light going across the sky from east to west.  It was too high to be a helicopter and too fast to be a plane.  The solid light was steadily moving across the sky. As we keep our eyes on it, we notice it begins to slow down.  Then it comes a complete stop. It hovers there for about 5 minutes.  By the time I found my binnoculars the light, still at a stop, begins to dim and slowly fades away.  It was the weirdest thing we've ever seen.;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
Fleet of multiple pulsating color spheres.;2014-02-01 20:58:00;5 minutes;Fleet of multiple pulsating color spheres. Six colored spheres coming from north to south in Covina, C.A. The pulsating lights were red, green, and yellow in color.  The objects were in a disrupted zigzag formation coming from the north of Glendora foothills heading south.  The objects speed was if it were in water flowing in a stream with no gravitational limitations. The first object in the front broke the formation by drifting off to the left of the others pausing and pulsating seemingly in and out of the atmosphere.  A few others seemed to follow. one of the last objects was bright and did not move until it was one of the last ones, then the ball of light started to throb and start to drift to the left were the others had dissipated to and finally dimmed out. I have most of this experience on cell phone recorded video with background stabilization in the images. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

It was dusk and I could see no structure but the lights abutted one another in a triangular format.  When first sighted, it was motionless.  It then suddenly descended straight down at a VERY high speed.  I assumed that I would hear a crash.   A minute or so later, it ascended to the precise same spot. It hovered there for a minute or so, then repeated the same rapid descent.  I did not see it again.  No sound and no other sighting. I did not get any any video or photos.  There was no trail.  The entire event was about 5 minutes. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I will do some checking for others who may have seen it.  It descended and ascended so fast that it was hard to believe.  No acceleration.  From zero to full speed instantly.   However, at that time of day, others would have seen it.   I will report back if I find any corroborating reports.

I have seen meteors, satellites, and planes before and this was none of them.  The light was brighter than any star I have seen.  White with a blue tint.;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
