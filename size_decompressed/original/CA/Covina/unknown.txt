Suddenly I saw a bright blue streak followed by a large bright circular white light in the sky.  It must have been miles wide.  I took a pic with my cell phone.  The white light disappeared within a few minutes and the blue light remained a little longer before disappearing as well.  The small aircraft was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.
