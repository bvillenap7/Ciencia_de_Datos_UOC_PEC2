a lighted object moving across the sky... west to east... no sound, in a cloudy sky...;2000-01-23 18:30:00;about 2 or 3 mins;a lighted object moving across the sky... west to east... no sound, in a cloudy sky... ok it's cloudy here... and it was long and wide, sort of a cross between rectangular and oval.   It was moving across the sky slowly... almost like a cloud against a cloudy sky... only faster than that... there were lights in it... a plane flew over head, and the plane was moving faster than that... the one guy we were standing with said he thought it was a blimp, but I said it was moving too fast for that, but too slow to be a plane, and too wide to be a helicopter... And then we couldnt see it anymore, because buildings were blocking our sight... and I thought I should report it.;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
Grey Object hovers over house in Covina, surrounds observer with a beam of light then bright blue shape remains in sky.;2000-07-07 21:30:00;20 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Vandenberg AFB at 2125 hrs..  PD)) Grey Object hovers over house in Covina, surrounds observer with a beam of light then bright blue shape remains in sky. The following was reported to me by my brother (extended family - he and his wife are my brother and sister.  Friday (July 7, 2000), around 9:30 p.m., my brother , who lives in Covina, CA, was taking out trash.  As he walked back towards the house, he noticed something moving towards the house.  within seconds, an object hovered over his house.  He said it was larger than a helicopter, had no visible propellers, etc., was grey, had some blue lights.  No wind nor sound came from the object.  A beam of white light suddenly shone on him.  He was frightened.  He called his wife but she did not hear him so he ran into the house to get her.  By the time they both came outside, the object appeared to be miles high.  All that was visible was a bright blue oval shape cloudy image.  It remained there for a long while then disappeared.  My brother reported this to me this morning.  His wife confirmed that she was a bright blue oval shape against the dark sky and that it remained there for a long while.  She said that my brother was shaking when he came in to get her.  My brother is convinced the object that hovered over his house was a UFO as may be expected, he is frightened. This afternoon, I contacted my son-in-law, who told me that my daughter had seen a bright white object in the sky on the same evening (in Monrovia, CA, around the same time).  My daughter confirmed this and said the large, bright light did not move and that it emitted a beam.  She and her friend had joked that it was a UFO (Neither believes in UFOs - My son-in-law and I do). My grandson heard my conversation and he said that his friend Andy (who lives in El Monte, CA) had seen a light in the sky on Friday. He had told my grandson and some friends (at a slmber party) about the large flash he and his grandmother had seen and he said that,later, his grandmother him told she had heard it was a missle exploding.   I contacted Andy, who said his grandma (aa very religious person and non-UFO believer) had seen it.  I spoke with her and she confirmed seeing a large white light, surrounded by bluish cloud/mist on the same night at the same time.  She said at first she thought it might be a religious experience (so had my brother) but then noted that this light just remained there and then there was a large white flash.  She said that it was reported on tv that something had gone wrong with a missle and it had been exploded. All of the above was related to me at different times by different individuals who had not been in contact with each other.  I can testify to the honesty of the individuals who saw the object/light.  None believed in UFOs but are now believing that there are visitors out there.;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
Green oval and purple oval UFO in covina;2013-06-28 22:00:00;15-20 minutes;Green oval and purple oval UFO in covina We were cooking out on the night of Friday, June 28th about 10:00pm. in Covina, California.  there were several neighbors outside all talking by the pool, and even the apartment manager was with us.  I noticed a green light in the sky as i sat and ate.   so i got up to see what it was.  that's when i really started to see that it was very bright light moving back and forth in the sky, very unlike an airplane or a helicopter.   So i called it to the attention of everyone. there were about 10 witnesses to the event. Everyone saw this thing glowing bright in the night sky. and it appeared to have a smaller reddish purple craft following it around. smaller.. or maybe not as bright.  it made hard turns in the sky and would disappear without warning and re-appear the same way.  At one point it dropped suddenly out of the sky as if it would a molten flame.  it disappeared below the tree line in the distance, only to reappear again in the sky.  truly an amazing site!   To get a better look i got out my binoculars.  This is when i realized it was something special.  Through the binoculars i could see it was an oval craft lined with what looked like 6-8 green light around the perimeter of the object.  and this is when i could see it turning and banking like a ship in the ocean.  making turns and even turning in a way that appeared to be upside down. The purple craft was also the same shape.  But smaller in size.  And its had one red light on one of its sides.  it moved with the red light behind it, as if it were the back of the craft moving forward.  i (we) also saw this craft turning, banking fast and flipping over or.. doing upside down turns.  we all took cell phone videos. they came out OK.. not great, but you can see a green dot in the sky.  We continued to watch until they were gone for good.  we stayed outside for another 2 hours and nothing returned.  This not the first time ive seen stuff in the Covina area.  it seems to be a hot bed of activity over the last 10 years. Looking through the binoculars was the best way to view it.  I find it hard to believe the whole town didn't see this event.  Many of the witnesses this night we non-believers and never seen anything before.  They have ALL changed their opinions! im excited to hear if anyone else saw this!!!;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
