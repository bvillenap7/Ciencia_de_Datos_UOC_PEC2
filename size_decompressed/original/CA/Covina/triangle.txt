Large Triangle shaped Lights(object) passed across the sky in total silence;2008-04-01 00:55:00;about 45sec-1min;Large Triangle shaped Lights(object) passed across the sky in total silence My friend and I were standing out front of his house this morning at about 12:55am when he exclaimed look and pointed to the southern sky. What i saw was a triangular shaped group of lights that stayed fixed in position but were coming more clearly into our field of vision (traveling south to northwest across vision). If these lights were at regular airplane flying level, the triangle object should have been at least 3 times bigger than a 747. At this time i was doubting what i was seeing because it was so unbelievable. It was not until the large object had passed bye us that i realized that there was absolutely no sound being emitted, and it in fact seemed quieter, as if all ambient noise was being hushed. The total time of this sighting was about 45 seconds. I would have to guess that the object was triangular and flat because when i saw it in the southern sky four lights were visible but as it passed by other lights came into view on the rear. The lights also would shift in brightness probably due to the angle which it was being viewed at. The object kept traveling until out of view. I looked at NASA to see if it could have been the ISS but the orbit of the station travels North to South.;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
