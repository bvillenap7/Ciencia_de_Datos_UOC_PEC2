2 ufo and 2 fighter jets over Covina, CA, at 12.20pm, March 26, 2017.  (see video.);2017-03-26 12:24:00;2 seconds;2 ufo and 2 fighter jets over covina califonia at 12.20pm march 26 2017. see video. COVINA, CALIFORNIA UFO VIDEO--On March 26, 2017, at 12:30 pm, I received a copy of a video taken with an android phone.  The person holding the phone/camera stated that two jets (likely F-16) were circling the area of approximately Covina/San Dames, Ca.  During the approach of the 2nd circling of the two jets, she decided to start recording.  She also stated that the two jets were heard from 7am to 1pm, on and off during that day.  All the rest of the facts are on the video. As a ((specialty deleted/medical)), people literally trust me with their lives.  I understand how important it is to only deal with facts.  I have never seen a video that shows a “cat and mouse” chase with two f-16 jets and two UFO’s,( in my opinion, most likely 2 ufo drones) especially in the day time over the Los Angeles area.  I would guess the speeds of the ufo’s  are over 30,000 mph.  All the activity appears to occur during time/second 20 to 22.  The 2 UFO’s appear at exactly the same time as the two jets enter into the cloud. I swear all this is true and accurate to the best of my ability.

((NUFORC Note:  We do observe two black splotches that appear in the video for a fraction of a second, but we have no idea what they are, and we do not have enough information to conclude that they are any type of unusual craft.  The F-16's appear to be flying in a normal two-plane formation, and do not appear to react to anything unusual in their proximity.  The splotches may be photographic anomalies, rather than actual objects, we suspect.  PD)) ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, The only  audio I know are the jets.

On the dark side of the Moon, I see an object appear.;2017-07-27 19:00:00;3 minutes;At 7 pm, I was outside waiting for my wife to come home, so I decide to look up to see the moon and On the Dark Side of the Moon, I see an object appear.   Begins to move north at a very slow pace and slowly Vanishing.   It was obviously small from where I'm standing, but by the shape of the Moon and the shape of the object which was like a silver color, it looked quite big.;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
