Driving south on Banna Ave. approching Ruddock st. on my way to pick up my granddoughter from girlscout meeting at Royal Ock middleschool, I observed  a  peach glowing object heading in my dierection high in the sky. the light was too big for an airplaine or heleocopter light and too off- color. I pulled to the curb shut off the car engine and listened for the sound of a motor. this residential area is very quiet and no sound came from the object until it was almost dierectly overhead. that is when I heard a single pop or more like a crack, as you might here from an electrical arc .from high above, I checked the time it was 7:59.  my nine year ol d granddaughter would be out of the meeting so i continued to the school a few blocks away. A couple of streets west and turning south again on Glendora Ave. I looked back to wher it should have been but there was nothing. when I arrived back home I took out my binoculars and went outside to my driveway. At about 8:30 p.m. to the north of my house are high voltage transmition lines,about 1.1/2 mi away . I saw an orange glow for maby thirty seconds  coming from that visinity. this is just north of the 210 freeway in Glendora. my street N. Garsden ave. runs  north and south. the north end of my street points to the dierection that I saw the glow.;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
