Boomerang shaped craft with orange lights on bottom sighted in Covina, CA.;2000-05-12 22:17:00;3-5 minutes;Boomerang shaped craft with orange lights on bottom sighted in Covina, CA. Personal account of sighting: On Friday, May 12th at approximately 22:17 my fiancé and I were exiting our vehicle at her home in Covina, California. I went over to close her passenger door when she noticed something floating in the night sky. It was gray in color and at first appeared to be an owl or bird of prey with a large wingspan hovering above her house. Upon closer inspection, we both realized that it was not!  As I looked closer I noticed the following: Was boomerang in shape... § It floated about 500-2000 feet in the air § moved slightly faster than a blimp, however, not as fast as a conventional aircraft § was very well camouflaged in the orange-gray night sky § had a wingspan of about 30-60 feet § moved in a North East direction § had an airspeed of less than 50 miles per hour § had what appeared to be very tiny and faint orange lights all over it under carriage § did not change course or speed § had no engine sounds § and, no navigation lights common to conventional aircraft. I quickly scrutinized what we were looking at based on my knowledge as a senior aircraft maintenance technician in the Air Force reserves. It was then that I (and my fiancé) realized what we had seen.  We looked at each other and acknowledged the facts we had seen a UFO. As to the nature of its origin (military or alien) we could not say with any certainty.  We do however, agree it was an advance technology. It should be noted that we were looking in the sky because there was some police helicopter activity about two miles away. The object we saw appeared to have no concern of the busy night sky and was headed in the opposite direction. The next day, My pager failed to function.  I called the paging company and they sent me a new one.  However, that one did not work and they had to send another, and another. The third pager was an upgaded diffrent signal unit and then worked.  However, each page I had including the original, turned on and has a beep as if fully functioning.;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
Without sound, and very well lit-up, it sparatically moved left to right, at times glidding downward at a right angle.;2002-02-11 03:45:00;30 min.;Without sound, and very well lit-up, it sparatically moved left to right, at times glidding downward at a right angle. The craft was as high up as planes fly, but at least 5 times the size. The shape was odd. It was long, and one side (the left, from ground view) went upward. As if you were looking at an L, only the horrizontal line leaned toward the left. The movement of this craft was right and left movements. It did not move straight down, instead, it moved downward gliding to the right. It was sometimes fast in its longer movements ( lft to rt ) and moved not slow, but slower, when moving shorter distances of left to right. For the most part, it just went back and forth, (lft to rt). I saw no paticular color, it was lit up as planes are, with one light being stonger and bigger than the rest wich covered the craft one side to the other. There was no colored lighting...just white.;34.0929491666666;-117.887760833333
