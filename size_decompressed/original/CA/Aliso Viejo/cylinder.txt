A silver-white cylinder with detached bright yellow light right underneath seen hovering 1000 feet up and sped up noislessly.;2005-08-27 21:45:00;3-4 min;A silver-white cylinder with detached bright yellow light right underneath seen hovering 1000 feet up and sped up noislessly. I was walking with wife in a residential area (condominium complex)which is a densly populated area in South Orange county (roughly between LA and San Diego) about 12 miles from the coast.  The sky was clear, great visibility, hot (about 80), almost no wind, no moon.  All of a sudden, we both saw a brightly lit object consisiting of two parts: one being a perfectly shaped cylinder oriented vertically, silver white in color, the other part was resembling a yellow disk emitting much brighter light like a large star (my wife describes this as a flat lantern).  The object was hovering at about 1000 feet above us for 5-6 seconds without a sound, then started to move slowly and then faster and faster to the left and ascending at the same time. We heard no sound.  Finally the objet became resembling a yellow star and disapperead from view completely.  Unfortunately, we were at the street alone, nobody else was out at that time.   We are both professionals, highly educated and never believed in these phenoms described in the UFO books and elsewhere.  However, this experience changed our view on this phenomenon - what was going on?;33.5700737588653;-117.705677304964
