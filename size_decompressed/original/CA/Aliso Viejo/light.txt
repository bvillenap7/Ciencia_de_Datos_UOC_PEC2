A very bright white light moving slowly West from the South, South East of Aliso Viejo California.;2009-08-25 21:45:00;Hours;A very bright white light moving slowly West from the South, South East of Aliso Viejo California. Brightest light in the sky. Moving very slowly. People across the canyon from us were taking pictures of it. It is too bright to be a star. It is moving too slow to be a plane. I am looking at it towards the South, South East from my location. Don't know what to make of it.;33.5700737588653;-117.705677304964
Bright, moving cluster of lights above South Orange County;2011-02-03 19:12:00;more than 30 minutes;Bright, moving cluster of lights above South Orange County Looking approximately 131 degrees southeast from my window in Aliso Viejo, CA.  Noticed lights over southern horizon at about 7:12 PM.  The lights seemed to break apart and merge again several times, with the number of lights visible at any one time ranging from 2 to 6.  All appeared to be the same size and all glowed a bright orange-yellow light, noticeably brighter than any of the city lights.  Distance was hard to judge, but was definitely past the horizon several miles away.  They moved very slowly, some of them merging together.  At various points, new lights appeared higher in the sky than the others, this is what convinced me that they were not coming from the ground. Lights would go out before going below the horizon.  At approximately 7:48 PM, the number of lights dwindled down to two, and then the two merged into one.  The final light remained stationary in the sky for one to two minutes before going out.  No further lights have been seen.  Additionally, at ! one point, a light noticeably coming from an aircraft was seen crossing east to west above the lights about ten to fifteen minutes after I first saw the lights.

6 orange orb-ish lights in Aliso Viejo.;2017-03-14 23:50:00;30 minutes;6 orange orbish lights in Aliso Viejo I drive a patrol car for a securiry company, graveyard shift.  I was pulling into one of the communities that I hit everynight, and it's located on the side of a hill that overlooks a valley to the hills by San Juan Capistrano.  That's where I saw 3 dark orange lights that almost looked like they were on fire.  I see that hill across the Valley every night and thought rhat the lights looked way too big, and that I never saw them before and thats when out of nowhere 3 more just descend from above out the black of night looked like fireballs coming down to the earth when they suddenly stopped directly above the original 3.   There was a group of about 4 or 5 kids at a park bench about 40 yarda away from me that couldn't stop watching this either the lights just floated there for a minute and then started spreading out towards the ocean.   I lost track of 4 of them, but 2 stayed in the first location for about 30 minutes;33.5700737588653;-117.705677304964
