round object hovering over city with upper and lower row of lights;2006-12-27 21:15:00;2 min;round object hovering over city with upper and lower row of lights As my fiance and I were entering a Khols department store, we noticed two rows of white lights that seemed to be stationary in the sky above the store, the object appeared to have been within 1/4 mile of our location. There was a single round shaped object that seemed to be hovering over the city. The object had two rows of bright white lights, that were around the edge of the circular shape, and between the two rows of lights was a single bright white light. The object appeared to have been between 500 and 1000 feet in elevation, and was pretty large. The night it happened, there was a low cloud cover, which the object was under. I noticed the cloud cover level, because there was absoulutely no sound coming from the object, and with low cloud cover,and lower elevation of the object, most aircraft would have made some sort of noise. The object moved slowly south, the seemed to sway from side to side loosing and gaining elevation with the sway. The object then slowly turned towards the east and moved away at a very slow pace until it went out of sight behind some buildings. As I changed locations to see the object again, it was no longer visible.  My fiance ( who is a marriage and family therapist) and myself (who is an environmental professional) both saw this object for approximately 2 min, and could not identify  what type of know aircraft this could have been.;33.5700737588653;-117.705677304964

Red light in the sky hovering over my truck.;2015-12-12 00:00:00;15 minutes;Red light in the sky hovering over my truck While I was unloading my truck, I looked to my left and saw a red light up in the sky, hovering and not moving.   I kept staring at and then it began to move away from me.  A few minutes later, it moved back to its original location.   While I was staring at it, it began to move towards me and then was directly over my head.  While it was over my head, I took my phone out and stated taking pictures of it, two total.   After that, it flew the opposite direction from its original position and stayed in one position.   A few minutes later, it went back to its original location, while the light remained red.  Shortly afterwards, the red light went off.   Since this day, I believe Iâ€™ve been under surveillance and have seen helicopters follow me up and down different freeways and then all the way home every night.;33.5700737588653;-117.705677304964
