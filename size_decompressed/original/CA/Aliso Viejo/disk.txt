Oval-shaped circle of very bright lights hovering and gliding from sided to side laterally in the sky over Aliso Viejo;2007-08-27 21:00:00;20 minutes;Oval-shaped circle of very bright lights hovering and gliding from sided to side laterally in the sky over Aliso Viejo We saw a brightly lit oval-shaped disk made up of lights surrounding a complete oval in the sky about 12,000 feet up. It look as if it were off in the distance a few miles (could have been more since there's no comparison to the size). You could see through the oval, and as it laterally transversed in the sky across long distances, it would change angle so you could see through the cirlce of lights (just looked black inside). It would shoot down as if to dart down to the earth sometimes spinning around and around. It went away for 15 minutes and then returned again for maybe 5 minutes to the same place, this time higher up in the sky as it swooshed down out of sight again. It would hover in one space and then travel laterally, as the angle changed quite frequently. No doubt in my mind, this was a UFO.;33.5700737588653;-117.705677304964
