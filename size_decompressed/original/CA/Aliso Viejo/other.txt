On top of a hill near my home while driving I saw a square shape in the sky with 4 lights each in corner flying towards me maybe a thousand feet in the air. It went over my car where I couldn't see it so I pulled over and turned the car so I could roll down my window and confirm what I saw. I then saw it go over another neighborhood and move erratically  and stopping a couple times. All this time I could see airplanes in the sky up above which had flashing lights and were miles higher. This object only had 4 dim lights- no flashing. It seemed to go any direction it wanted.;33.5700737588653;-117.705677304964
