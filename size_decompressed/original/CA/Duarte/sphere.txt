Three flickering red and yellow orbs.;2014-11-19 20:57:00;5 minutes;Three flickering red and yellow orbs. I went outside with my dog and observed three flickering round red and yellow objects in the sky, the objects were moving away from each other in different directions so I decided to film them,  by the time I could queue up my camera phone only two objects remained and I focused on the closest while the other moved up and over my head, the object I was filming then slowly moved west from my location and then sped up quickly and diasappeared.  I will gladly share video footage;34.1373821428571;-117.955771428571
