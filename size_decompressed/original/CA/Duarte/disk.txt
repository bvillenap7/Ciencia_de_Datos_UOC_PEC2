I wonder if you have a record of a plethora of reports of abductions from the San Gabriel Valley about then.  I dreamt that my wife and I were abducted.  This was by no means the typical abduction experience that you hear about nor was it by any means a typical dream.  The first night featured a dream that included a massive airlift of people being abducted while asleep. My wife and I were raised off of our beds, traveled through the house feet first to the back door, out the door then gradually into the air. We moved at a slow pace through the air. We met many others in the sky. All were floating through the air feet first dressed in pajamas. We landed in the Angeles Forest in the foothills of the San Gabriel Valley near a flying saucer.  One alien removed here helmet. She looked orientally human. She gave us shots in arm. Then we woke up. I remembered the dream. My wife did not. But we both had sore arms where the shots were administered and there were red marks. I had fallen asleep about 4:00 a.m. and awoke at 6:30.  The experience seemed to last 20 to 30 minutes. Very clear like a single long scene from a movie with no cuts.  This was a dream but of course what is a dream? This was by no means a typical abduction experience. No bright lights. No little green men. The alien looked very human.  There was no terror. There was no hypnosis required to help recall the dream. I remembered the dream as soon as I awoke.  But it was not a typical dream either!  Any similar reports in your archives from mid-July 1992?;34.1373821428571;-117.955771428571
