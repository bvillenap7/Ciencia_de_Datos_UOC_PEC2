The two lights were moving east quite fast without any sound. Two bright white lights moving east very rapidly over the san gabriel mountains.  There was no sound during this event as the lights moved above and behind the mountain rigde.  Very unusual since there is a very low cloud cover over the mountains.  It is the strangest thing I have ever seen.  Hope someone else witness this event.;34.1373821428571;-117.955771428571
Light far beyond mountains flew across very fast and then takes off in a vertical direction;2008-10-30 06:00:00;20 seconds;Light far beyond mountains flew across very fast and then takes off in a vertical direction It looked like a star above the San Gabriel mountains. It was flying really fast.  Then, it slowed down just a little bit and turned and headed straight up at an even faster speed.  I then lost sight of it.;34.1373821428571;-117.955771428571
Two satellite-like objects both traveling towards mountains and then disappearing;2009-02-02 18:35:00;1 minute;Two satellite-like objects both traveling towards mountains and then disappearing One satellite-like object was traveling at a fast speed going north towards the mountains. A second identical object trailed behind going the same direction at a slightly faster speed. The second object seemed to catch up. Both lights disappeared in the night. Both were too high up to hear anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.1373821428571;-117.955771428571
Two moving lights;2019-10-27 06:00:00;2 minutes;Two moving lights I went out in my backyard at 6 am and looked up at the stars. The sky was black and clear, and the visibility was good, with no clouds or moon. I saw a small point of white light which I thought was a satellite almost directly overhead moving steadily north to south in a straight line. I estimated it would pass through Orion's belt, and a few seconds later it did, but it got fainter until it disappeared before reaching the stars representing Orion's feet. A few seconds later I saw another similar light a few degrees farther north moving in roughly the same trajectory also north to south, but this one blinked on and off every 5 seconds or so - with longer intervals between blinks than a jet. It too disappeared after about 30 seconds of viewing, never having reached Orion.;34.1373821428571;-117.955771428571
