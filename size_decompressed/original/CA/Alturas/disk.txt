Jan. 15, 1997 approx. 5:30pm pacific time cloudy sky.  I was laying on my trampoline in my back yard when I saw a light which at first I thought was the sunset but it was the wrong direction for the sunset.  Then I saw a craft in the middle of the glow.  It just swayed back and forth. Then it was just gone.;41.4776;-120.5489
