Three lights appear in the Modoc County skies.;2006-08-29 22:00:00;Approxamatly 2 minutes;Three lights appear in the Modoc County skies. I was sitting outside, my appartment because it seemed very hot inside. I looked up in the night sky, and to the north there were three lights that appeared accompanied by the sound of a jet. They appeared small at first but they grew a bit larger, it looked like street lights in the sky. they were orange and oval in shape. The lights were in a horizontal row with the middle light a little lower than the other two. They appeared not to be too high in the sky. The light in the middle went back and fourth between the other two. The two outer lights faded out and then the middle one did. About 15 to 30 minutes later another light showed up just west of where the others had been. It seemed like there were many planes in the sky with their searchlights on, but I could not tell if they were planes for sure.  I was very dissapointed that I could not find my camera to show others what I had seen. I really was sceptical until last night. Now I really feel that there very well could be something out there.
