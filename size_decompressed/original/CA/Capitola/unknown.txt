Bright white and orange glowing lights in over Monterey Bay.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-22 19:42:00;2-4 minutes;Bright white and orange glowing lights in over Monterey Bay. Was facing SW and seen a dim patch of glow with haze around it. From where I was standing it seemed far and near.  Observing it at first was like trying to look at a star when it's cloudy out. It started out small and white then it grew and expanded to bright white light and looked like a very large comet.  Then it slowly faded back to a small glow haze, almost completely invisible.  Within thirty seconds it started glowing again and more intense into a bright orange, and red color.  Had a rounded blot shape which split into, which I could best describe as, two odd shaped balls of energy.  It got harder to see as it seemed it was getting farther away repeating the dim/high glow pattern. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
