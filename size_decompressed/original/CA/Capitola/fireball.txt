A minute or so later, another light appeared below it.  They moved around for a a minute before I went inside to get a camera and handed it to my wife.  She was confused at first and thought she was filming the UFOs, but I told her she was filming the streetlights!  So I took the camera from her and got a still shot of one of the lights before it faded out.   While watching the lights, a neighbor walked by and saw the lights as well.;36.9745;-121.9548
