Orange light in the sky;2011-12-04 18:17:00;3 mins;Orange light in the sky I was walking heading North West on New Brighton State Beach.  Approximately at 6:17 pm, there was a bright orange light that came from the north east heading south at a 45 degree angle.  It was like a ball of light, but it was not round.   It was bigger than a planet but smaller then the moon.  It stopped a few hundred feet above the neighborhood that is north of the beach.  It hovered in one place for a minute to two minutes.  I could not hear if it made a sound because I was walking right next to the ocean. It then headed upwards at another 45 degree angle away from me towards the northern direction.  It moved in this direction very fast and within 5 seconds,  the light got very small and then totally disappeared. I called the police and news station to see if anyone else reported something or if there was a festival going on, and there was not.  Please let me know if you saw something this evening;36.9745;-121.9548
