6 bright red orb-like objects in the sky hovering above Monterey Bay.;2017-02-13 20:00:00;>15 minutes;6 bright red orb-like objects in the sky hovering above Monterey Bay. They looked somewhat like fireballs moving fairly fast in all directions and slowly faded up into the sky within 2 minutes of one another.  Definitely NOT mistaken identity for flying lanterns.  I am not sure how long they were there for, from the time I noticed to the time they disappeared it had been about 15 minutes.;36.9745;-121.9548
