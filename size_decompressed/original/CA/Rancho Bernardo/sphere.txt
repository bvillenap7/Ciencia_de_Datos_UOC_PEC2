Small black sphere the size of a soccer ball with colorfull flashing lights ascends into the sky and disappears.;2014-11-19 11:00:00;1 minute;Small black sphere the size of a soccer ball, with colorfull flashing lights, ascends into the sky and disappears. I was looking outside my window and noticed a strange black sphere, about the size of a soccer ball, with colorful flashing lights raise up from behind a house and slowly ascend into the sky and disappear. There was one light on it that flashed like a strobe light and changed colors from blue to green to red to pink and all over again.   At first I thought the object was a remote control helicopter, but looking closely it seemed just a fuzzy black sphere with the flashing light.   The object rose upwards and seemed to be affected by the wind (heading to the west). By then it had raised to at least 500 feet or so.  There is a law about no UAVs higher than 400 feet in my area.  I looked away for a second and the object disappeared. The incident occurred in broad daylight at around 11:00 am..
