There were alot of scattered rain clouds overhead as the sun was just about to go down, but the sky was still clearly visible we were heading south on the old 163 freeway just outside the Mira Mar Naval Air Station when I happened to look up out my passenger window and spotted a bright silver metallic round object coming out from behind a cloud it appeared as if it were spinning however the closer it came the more visible it appeared to have bright lights blinking all the way around it making it appear like the craft was spinning but it wasnt.  There was a midsize car approx. 2 car lengths in front of us and across the freeway on the other side there was a vehicle the craft came down hovered over the vehicle in front of us than hovered over the car on the north bound side came back and hovered again over the vehicle in front of us than rose up and shot across the freeway in an easterly direction losing site of it.  The craft was approx. 25 feet round and metallic in color with a cylinder shape that came out from underneath releasing a vapor of some type when it would raise back up after hovering.  The brightness of the lights encircling the craft were almost blinding they were so bright, and on the top of the craft was a small dome where perhaps an occupant was piloting the craft.  I saw no markings on the outside but because of the brightness of the lights that doesnt mean there wasnt any.  Just after it bolted across the freeway and flew out of sight we were approaching the MiraMar Naval Air Station.;33.0287;-117.0846
