I looked up into the sky, Their was all these big lights, like they might be craft of some kind. They wer staggered out, but in a perfect formation. They were slowly moving South to North. I watched for about 4 minutes, they didn't chage directions, but stayed in a formation. No sounds were heard. Then the clouds moved in, and I could only see them in the breaks of the clouds for about 2 minutes. Then the clouds took over completely. It was fantastic, but chilling, too. No mention about them on news or the papers. A friend had called me to go out and check the site outside, he was in Santee, California. The object kinda look like giant stars, with a slight flickering.;33.0287;-117.0846

It was heading towards me coming from the south. As i watched it with  Ah a jogger stopped to also see what i was looking at and said &quotIt's not a plane&quot He left i stayed outside looking up at the floating star. at times it looked like little sparks of light would come off it and vanish. it had a flat trajectory with &quotNO&quot noise at all, &quotNO&quot indicator lights. I see F18's from MiraMar all the time and this was not one of them. It's shape was only a bright light and round from the loks of it. It floated on by overhead and continued towards Escondido. I watched this &quotClearly&quot for about 10 minutes.;33.0287;-117.0846
