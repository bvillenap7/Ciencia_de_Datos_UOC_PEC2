Light over San Fernando Valley.;2007-11-06 20:30:00;15 seconds;Light over San Fernando Valley. Sitting in back yard, when I heard a low flying prop plane, looked up and saw what appeared to me to be a firefly trailing the plane, it moved very fast and popped around the sky like an insect would, it went straight at first, then made a U shaped turn, i lost the object for second but caught it further to my right, it bobbed up and down and then moved at a speed that was to fast for me to see.  it did make a trail of light but only as any light would that moves fast. the light that it emitted was similar to a star but was greener in tint.  i have never seen fireflies in l.a. before and as far as i can research there are no species of firefly native to california.;34.1671;-118.5373
