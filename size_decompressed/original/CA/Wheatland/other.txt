I looked (I’m driving) and was like no it’s too low to be a star it looks really close.  We noticed it was hovering perfectly still.  It didn’t move at all until we got closer I noticed it started going straight upwards.  We saw 2 very bright white lights side by side on the same craft and on each side was white lights flashing.  The aircraft looked big, long and thin. Like a thing oval shape. And we ended up right underneath it and saw the 2 bigger white lights and the flashing lights on each end as it slowly moved upward. It was way too big to be a drone and it wasn’t the shape of a helicopter or airplane. ((NUFORC Note:  Source, who elects to remain anonymous, does not indicate a date.  PD));39.0303;-121.4227
