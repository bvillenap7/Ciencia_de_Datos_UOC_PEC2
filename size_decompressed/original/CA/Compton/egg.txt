Egg/Saucer over Los Angeles.;1999-03-31 18:00:00;15 minutes;Egg/Saucer over Los Angeles I was driving East down El Segundo Blvd., as I approached Wilmington Ave, I noticed in the North-East direction an amber/peach colored egg shaped object rotating and hovering with a white blinking light at the top of the object.  The object appeared to tack through the air in a south easterly direction it would vertically float down in a straight line, and move up-wards at about a 35 degree angle to move through the air.  Out of shock, I disregarded where I needed to go, and proceeded past Wilmington Ave to follow the object.   Out of fear as I neared Willowbrook Ave I discontinued following the object (ironically not one person was outside).  The object eventually fell out of site and appeared to land in an industrial part of Compton in a South-Easterly direction near what I would approximate to be east of Santa Fe & Alameda.  This is when it gets really strange.  I was initially going to church for a “new couples” marriage counseling session, so I turned around ! with my wife, proceeded West on El Segundo Blvd, headed South on Wilmington Ave, made it to church and proceeded with the counseling session.  About 1 hour later as we exited the church I excitedly informed the pastor as to what I observed, crouched down only to notice the object outside of the church to the north, hovering and rotating behind a tree.  At this point I got in my car and drove home. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.8781833860756;-118.218376424048
