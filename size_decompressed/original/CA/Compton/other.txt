STRANGE TUBE UFO SEEN ACROOS SKY;2002-12-30 20:42:00;15 seconds;STRANGE TUBE UFO SEEN ACROOS SKY IT WAS A CLEAR SKY WHEN MY COUSIN AND I HEARD A LOUD NOISE. WE LOOKED UP AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE AND SAW AN OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE A SORT OF LONG TUBE WITH 4 WINGS STICKING OUT THE SIDE. THE WINGS LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE FLAPPING LIKE A BIRD. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS ONE LONG UFO OR TWO UFO VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTER. THERE WERE NO LIGHTS ON THE UFO, BUT YOU COULD SEE A LIGHT GREYISH COLOR. I ESTIMATED IT WAS 13OOO - 15000 FEET HIGH. I ALSO ESTIMATED IT WAS 500 - 600 FEET ACROOS.;33.8781833860756;-118.218376424048
