Red Star like light in LA night sky;2003-10-30 20:00:00;10 minutes;Red Star like light in LA night sky I noticed a bright light in the night sky (to put the luminosity and size into perspective, try and imagine Mars at it brightest X 2 and its luminosity about twice as bright)At first I thought it was some type of aircraft so I tried to determine if there was any movement. I noticed some movement though it was slow and purposeful. It was bright red - which is why I thought it was some type of aircrafe -  and seemed to oscillate in its luminosity. It would grow brighter and larger then reduce in luminosity and size in no apparent pattern. We used a cheap Camcorder with a slight zoom lens to see a closer picture of whatever it was and it appeard in the small LCD as a red disk. After about ten minutes time it just dissappeared. About 90 seconds later in another part of the night sky - what appeared to be a shooting star appeared.;33.8781833860756;-118.218376424048
I really know that what i saw was not of this earth;2009-09-21 21:45:00;30 minutes;I really know that what i saw was not of this earth I was in my back yard, i looked up at the sky because it was very clear. I was able to see more stars than ever before.  I then all of a sudden focused in on one star in particular that seemed like it was showing movement, i then called my girlfriend to come outside to confirm that i wasn't going crazy, she also saw what i saw and got scared just to go back inside.  I was amazed, i finally saw a craft that was flying in impossible angles, I would really like to report this to someone that is going to give me some kind of feedback, about what it was that saw.  Also, id like to add that at first when my girlfriend and i went outside to look at the stars, she was looking at a direction that i could not see with my peripheral vision when all of a sudden she said Ohhh my god!, I just saw a shooting star, but i assume that shooting stars fall down, not zoom up, which is the direction she said she saw it fly.;33.8781833860756;-118.218376424048
