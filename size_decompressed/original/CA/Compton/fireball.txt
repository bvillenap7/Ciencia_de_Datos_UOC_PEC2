Saw a ball of light floating in the sky;2012-09-12 23:00:00;1 minute;I saw a ball of light floating in the sky over a school.  It lingered around for about 1 minute then it disappeared.  I have seen these balls of light more than 5 times now.   When it disappeared it changed from being white in color to a fire looking red color.  It was silent.

1 Bright Orange Fireball Looking Sphere In The Night Sky.;2013-12-26 23:30:00;1:30;1 Bright Orange Fireball Looking Sphere In The Night Sky It was December, 26, 2013 around 11:30pm when i was looking up at the North Star snapping pictures.  As I was taking pictures, the object was on my left from where i was standing and was moving to my right.  Then this object starting flying upwards for about 20 seconds and disappeared.  What i did noticeabout this UFO was that there was no strobe lights it was just one solid orange color it was glowing in the sky sort of like a shine from a fire but i doubted it was fire until investigated and seen recent reports of a mystical ufo fireball and then stated to believe that’s what i saw.  When i was snapping the pictures the object was in motion.  If you rewiew my pictures and zoom in on every picture you’ll see the orange orb.  On the pictures that show the tree was when the object was flying upwards, on these pictures i had the camera on slow shutter speed at 2 seconds i believe i took pictures of a UFO.  I would please like everyone to review my pictures and my report.;33.8781833860756;-118.218376424048
