I stopped myself and steadied my breath and observed it again. And it continued to do the same in a very small grid, and then it went back to a slow straight pattern then once again, making suttle strange movements. I clearly made myself as absolutely steady as possible leaving against my truck. And observed it for a few more minutes continuing it's straight path overhead. It seemed to have some sort of reflective qualities on it. It was very quite out and I heard zero sound and it was very very high.
