At about 10:30 PM, while driving on US 5, to the west of US 5, I saw a brilliant blue orb fall from the sky.  It started at about 30 degrees above the southern horizon and fell to about 5 degrees above the horizon where I lost view of it.  I cried out,Oh! when I saw it and Yael got a glimpse of it as well.  No sound was associated with the object. It did not appear to be a shooting star because it was moving too slowly so close to the horizon.   It took place about 150 miles North of Los Angeles in the same general vicinity of where I saw a brilliant blue orb fall from the sky on July 28th.  This event occured after I gave a talk to 70 people at Bay Area Mufon where I emphasized the what I believe is a consciousness link between UFO experiencers and the intelligence behind the phenomenon, presumably ET in nature.;36.1624;-120.3489
