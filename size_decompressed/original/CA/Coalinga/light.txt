3 bright lights swooping by the freeway in a figure-of-eight-type pattern.;2002-08-15 22:30:00;2 minutes;3 bright lights swooping by the freeway in a figure-of-eight-type pattern. Driving on the I-5 south, we saw 3 bright lights approaching the freeway.  At first we thought it was a plane, but as it got closer I realized that this was no plane.  It was 3 bright lights moving simultaneously.  They would approach the side of the freeway and loop around going really fast and then swoop down and fly back up to their starting point.  almost like they were moving in a figure-of-eight pattern back and forth.  as i drove by them, i noticed they were still there in my rearview mirror and at one point, they looked as if they were coming at us from behind.  I have never seen anything like it before.  Traffic was slowing down to observe this.  I also noticed that a strikingly similar report about this same occurrence in this same area on the same freeway has been filed last year.  Might that mean that there is some explanation for this? ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with both witnesses to this incident, and they seem to us to be quite credible.  PD));36.1624;-120.3489
