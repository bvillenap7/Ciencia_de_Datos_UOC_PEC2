I was at work before sunrise around 5:50 am. I was in the back of my work site when I spotted a bright white light object & sometimes it was radomes colors.  It started moving around and it seemed at times very small & then it would appear bigger.  I started taking pictures of the-object & videos.  So I can look at it latter.    What got my attention was that it seemed like it was hovering around.;36.1624;-120.3489
