SOMETHING  RIGHT AT MY WINDOW!!!!;1983-05-24 01:30:00;5 MIN;SOMETHING  RIGHT AT MY WINDOW!!!! I WAS ABOUT 6 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME. I SHARED A BEDROOM WITH MY OLDER BROTHER HE WAS 14 YEARS AT THE TIME. I WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, FOR SOME STRANGE REASON. I LOOK OUT THE WINDOW ABOVE MY BROTHERS BED AND SAW THIS HEAD AND BODY HOVERING LIKE SUPERMAN. I STOOD THERE STIFF ALL I CAN SEE WAS BIG BLACK EYES AND A LARGE HEAD. THIS THING WAS WAVEING AT ME! NOW I NEVER KNOW WHAT THIS THING LOOKED LIKE, BUT WHEN I SAW PICTURES OF IT I KNEW WHAT IS WAS, EXACTLY WHAT I SAW. I JUMPED OFF THE BED, GOT BACK INTO MY OWN. I YELLED AT MY BROTHER TO WAKE UP, AND I SAID LOOK AT THE WINDOW. AND HE DID AND HE STARED AT IT FOR 45 SECONDS, AND HE GOT SCARED AND TRIED TO WAKE UP MY DAD. MY DAD SAID GO BACK ASLEEP IT PROBLY A CAT. MY BROTHER AND ME WERE SCARED WE SLEPT IN OUR PARENTS ROOM FOR THE NIGHT. NOW ME AND MY BROTHER NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT SINCE, UNTIL TEN YEARS AFTER, I ASKED HIM ABOUT A HE TURN WHITE AND A FEW MINUTES LATER HE LOOK AT ME AND WAVED THE SAME WAY THAT THING I SAW. AND I GOT SCARED BECAUSE THE NIGHT WHEN IT HAPPED, I NEVER TOLD HIM IT WAS WAVING AT ME! SEE I THOUGH SINCE I WAS SO YOUNG, I WAS SEEING THINGS. BUT MY OLDER BROTHER SAW IT TOO.
