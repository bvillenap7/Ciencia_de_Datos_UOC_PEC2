Pulsating circular object;2013-02-10 08:45:00;10 minutes;Pulsating circular object UFO was spotted over parking lot of market, I saw many people looking up and thought someone was on roof of market.  After parking, I looked up and saw a circular object that pulsated green and blue, the bottom was very black and seem to also glow.  It spin and seemed to morph as it changed colors, had one flashing light at one end.  It hovered at about 4000 feet and just disappeared into thin air as if it had invisibility built in, was gonna video it but was gone before I could start.;34.2529000000001;-118.418000000001
Color changing object in north east  sky.;2013-09-12 22:00:00;00:00;color changing object in north east  sky. Ive been noticing this object for the past couple of weeks.  The object seems to change colors mainly from white to red, it appears at the same time every night usually at 22:30.  The object moves suddenly between 23:30 and 23:45, it moves up in just a matter of minutes.   From where i stand the object is always at a north east position.  It's as if it is signiling  or communicating with something else. Ive lived here my whole life and if it were always there like people tell me it has been i would have noticed it along time ago.;34.2529000000001;-118.418000000001
