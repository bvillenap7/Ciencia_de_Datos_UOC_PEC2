A string of 100 plus white bright lights traveling uniformly on the horizon for 5 plus minutes.   ((Starlink satellites??));2021-02-12 05:05:00;5 minutes;A string of 100 plus white bright lights traveling uniformly on the horizon for 5 plus minutes A string of evenly spaced small white solid lights began to appear one at a time due east of Kingsburg above or beyond the Sierra Nevadas.  The sky was clear and dark, no moon.  It started around 5:05am and continued for 5 plus minutes.  I am estimating I saw 100 plus in all.   They started low on the horizon, descending on approximately a 30 degree slope.  They appeared to be traveling south east, remaining visible for about 45 seconds until they disappeared in or behind the Sierras.  At first they were more evenly spaced but as the progression continued they became spaced two close together with wide spaces in between.   The decent line was very straight and their speed was consistent start to finish.  ;36.5111;-119.5451
