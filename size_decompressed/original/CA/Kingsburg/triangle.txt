We noticed a unusual formation, it looked like stars but they were traveling in a equally shaped small triangler form. All we sya were the lights, nothing visible to the eye in the formation, just black. It traveled for about five minutes or so when two of the ends of the triangle started to fade away. The formation started to slow down, and the two corners of the formation dissapeared and the final end left stopped and stayed still. Almost trying to blend in with the stars.

Triangle objects near Kingsburg, CA.;2016-01-11 18:18:00;2 minutes;Triangle objects near Kingsburg, CA. The objects were flying in unison for the majority of the time they were viewed.  They flew side by side from east to west over the 99 freeway just before the Kingsburg, CA city limits.  The two objects were in site for approximately 2 – 3 minutes.   As I stopped to look, the objects flew from the 10–2 o’clock position then disappeared.  The night was clear, no fog.  The lights were a constant white glow.  They did not change colors or flicker.;36.5111;-119.5451
