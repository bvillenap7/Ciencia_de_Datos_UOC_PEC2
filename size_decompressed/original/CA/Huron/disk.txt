Upside down triangular obect with red pulsating lights floating above a airfield in Nothern California;2010-07-14 01:30:00;5 MINUTES;Upside down triangular obect with red pulsating lights floating above a airfield in Nothern California As I drove home from Southern California, I wanted to enjoy the stars and there was no moon so the stars were extra bright.  I waited until there was no traffic so I could swerve a little as I stared out the window.    Just as all the cars drove off, I had noticed a upside down triangular object with red pulsating lights going left to right over and over.  A car had sped past me and I had sped up to 110mph to catch up with him and the other cars.  The drivers around me had taken notice as I was able to see their faces off of the interior lighting. They slowed and I seen one pointing, the object began to disappear more and more until it was barely visible then vanished.  A couple of minutes later, there were four air crafts with blinking lights that were floating around where the UFO had traveled.  I noticed one to my left at first then another one was flying toward him underneath.  There was also one ahead of us and above.  This did occur near a airfield but the initial craft that caught my attention was unlike that I had ever seen in person, the pulsating lights left me dumbfounded.
