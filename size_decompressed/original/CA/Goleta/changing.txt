Triple metamorphosis.;2016-09-08 16:00:00;2 minutes;Triple metamorphosis I am a lifelong skywatcher and have seen many ufos.  This event was unique in that the object metamorphosed.  It happened as follows:  After a long day of work I accompanied my kids to the community pool at 4:00 pm.  While the kids were swimming I was laying on my back in the grass.  After a few minutes I observed what looked like a 6 inch soap bubble a hundred feet or so off the ground.   After twenty seconds the object transformed into what looked like a small jet at 10,000 feet more or less.  After fifteen seconds the object became a white dot that faded into the blue sky.  The trajectory of the object was a strait line until it disappeared.  The direction of the object was southerly, toward Point Mugu, which is an area having multiple sightings per month seemingly exiting and entering the Pacific Ocean.   Common thought relates these sightings to the mysterious booming sounds heard centered around Alhambra (LA).  It is hypothesized that an undersurface excavation is occurring under Los Angeles.  Food for thought? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));34.42712;-119.86104
