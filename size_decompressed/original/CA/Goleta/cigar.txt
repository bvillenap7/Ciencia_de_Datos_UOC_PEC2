The cloud was already beginning to dissipate and change shape. As I pointed the camera a thin rectangular shape began to appear, slice across the cloud and emerge as if being shoved. As it exited, the cloud appeared to fill in the space left behind. At that point I had to take the child inside and when I was able to return several minutes later the u.f.o. was gone.
