Massive Black Rectangle craft hovering in place above fog over Pacific Ocean.;2018-03-15 11:00:00;5 minutes;Massive Black Rectangle craft hovering in place above fog over pacific ocean. I observed this craft from a high mountain range elevation.  Looking south this massive craft was hovering just above the cloud line.  Approximate size would be that of intercostal container ship.  Surface appeared to be rough, similar to basalt.  Large square chunks composing the entirety of the mass.  This was an incredibly powerful sighting and I could feel its energy.  I could not believe what I was experiencing.  I just stared and watched for what seemed like 5 min.  Then time became a little fuzzy and then it was no longer there.  I was fortunate to experience this but it has left me incredibly confused due to the lack of similar sightings.  I have nothing to relate it to.;34.42712;-119.86104
