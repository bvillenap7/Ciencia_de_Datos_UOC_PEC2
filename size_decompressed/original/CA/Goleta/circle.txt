Day sighting disc craft geostationary chased away by jets.;1998-03-05 10:00:00;10 minutes;day sighting disc craft geostationary chased away by jets Date of Sighting:  5 March 1998  Location:  Goleta, CA  Time of Day:  Late morning  Weather:  Perfectly clear, cloudless  Visibility:  50 miles  I was working at a small start-up company, only a few employees.  My coworker first spotted the UFO and called me outside to observe it with him.  Looking straight over head into a clear sky we observed a UFO in perfect geostationary position.  It looked round (disc-like) and metallic (aluminum).  There were features to the underside (concentric structure).  The sun shone brightly on one side of the UFO, the underside exhibited shadow. It was impossible, not actually know the diameter of the UFO to know its altidude, but it appeared to many thousands of feet in the air, somewhat below where the commercial aircraft fly.  We watched for several minutes as the UFO stayed perfectly stationary. At some point my coworker (ex-air force) pointed to an approaching jet from the South-East (Port Hueneme air force jet?) vectored directly at the UFO.  Simultaneously, another jet was approaching from the North (Vandenberg?) also vectored directly at the UFO.  While the jets were still many miles out, the UFO began to ascend straight up, as witnessed by a rapidly decreasing appearance in size, into the clear sky, to the point where we could no longer see it.  It went straight up, 5 seconds, and was gone.;34.42712;-119.86104
