Saw 3 lights in a triangle shap and a still position in the night sky.;2004-01-07 19:00:00;30 seconds;Saw 3 lights in a triangle shap and a still position in the night sky. I was getting a ride home from a restaurant and we pulled into my driveway. I got out of the car and looked down the street and I saw 3 white lights (The color of car headlights) in a triangular shape in a still position. After about 20 seconds it moved towards the ocean. I didn't hear any sounds and the lights didn't rotate when it started to move so it couldn't have been a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));34.42712;-119.86104
Object left Earths atmosphere within 5 seconds;2008-01-14 12:25:00;45  seconds;Object left Earths atmosphere within 5 seconds Goleta, CA  Looking at the roofline of this house, I noticed an object flying past the sun (the sun was to the left on the fireplace chimney when standing on the right side of the front yard. looking back over the roof to the South). The object appeared to be about 1/100th or 1/150th the size of the sun. It flew from the point I first noticed the object latterly at approx. 40-degrees (in the skyline),  west to east for 30 seconds. At this time the object flew across the skyline and appeared to fly faster yet while ascending up to the stratosphere from a 90-degree angle straight up at which time it grew to less than the size of a balloon. It took approx. 5 seconds from the 90-degree turn for it to disappear. It was last seen heading NE to NW over the Santa Barbara coastal mountains.  As it crossed closest to my view it appeared bright white to bright gray. It looked to be a skinny triangle with one appendage coming off the top and it appeared to be fluttering and not flying. It resembled a boomer rang, but flying sideways with both points closest to the ground.  10 to 15 minutes after I saw the object I noticed what appeared to be 2 military fighter jets in the same vicinity.;34.42712;-119.86104
Black Triangle, 5 white lights over Goleta;2011-03-20 21:35:00;10 seconds;Black Triangle, 5 white lights over Goleta I was outside smoking a cigarette starring at the sky towards the direction of the channel islands and I saw a large black triangle flying very fast across the sky.  It was flying parrallel to the coast flying from south to north, maybe headed to Vandenberg AFB?  It had 5 large white glowing lights underneath in the shape of a V.  It's my first black triangle sighting and it was awesome!!!!!  I've seen lights in the sky before and gold and metallic craft before, even during the day but this was the best one so far!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded and credible.

Third Goleta sighting in five weeks.;2016-10-09 19:35:00;2 minutes;Third Goleta sighting in five weeks. My daughter and I were driving home at dusk heading west.  I was telling her about the virtues of looking up quite a lot.  One sees all sorts of things bugs, birds, stars, satellites, etc.  I decided to glance up out of the side window of the car and saw an aircraft seemingly triangular in shape.  The dusky light made it difficult to discern an actual shape.  There were three lights on the object one on the nose of bright white magnitude -7 appearance, one at each wingtip, port side red, starboard side amber, each of similar magnitude to the front light.  At first the object seemed to be a fighter jet at an approximate altitude of 500 ft traveling directly over the suburb of Goleta.  It traveled over the top of our vehicle on a banked trajectory at which point I told my daughter to look up and out of her side window.  She immediately located the object and noticed that only the wing lights remained visible but in a matter of seconds appeared white in color.  There were no flashing lights.  The object's trajectory became due north and, instead of planing off as a typical jet aircraft will do, the object seemed to maintain a strait line up at about 10 degrees and continued due north becoming seemingly a hundred miles away in a matter of thirty more seconds or so.  It eventually curved a bit before disappearing still well above the northern horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
