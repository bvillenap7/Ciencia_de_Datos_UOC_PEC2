Bright orange sphere seen over El Capitan State Beach 8/7/12;2012-08-07 21:10:00;4 minutes;Bright orange sphere seen over El Capitan State Beach 8/7/12 As we were camping at El Capitan state beach in CA.  While at our camp site stargazing at 9:10PM, My wife noticed a bright object approach from the east over some trees over some camp sights appx 100-200 ft in the airwith no sounds what so ever. As it hovered over the tree tops it was a very bright orange (sunlike)with lights (blue,green) underneath. It hovered for appx 3-4 minutes. While hovering the glow proceeded to dim.  The bright light turned into a small point type light. It turned slowly while hovering due southeast it started to cruise slowly and the light blinked twice, then completely disappeared flying southeast over the ocean. Iam fairly intelligable person and have never seen any type of aircraft that would handle like that.;34.42712;-119.86104
