My two friends saw something strange in the sky while smoking in the back yard.  One of them fetched his high powered video camera and shot a video of it.  The object flashed random light patterns. It changed shape constantly.  It appeared to be purple, but the outline of the object glowed green.  The object moved extremely fast and would change direction on a dime.  It would also change shape just as fast.  It lingered in the same general sky space for quite a long time and it appears to know it is being watched for it seems to be putting on a show of some sort.  Possibly attempting to communicate with the flashing light it emits?  After a while it just disappears into the night.;32.9728;-117.0379
