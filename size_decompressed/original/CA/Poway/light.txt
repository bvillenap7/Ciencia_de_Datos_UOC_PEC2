Saw 2 points of light moving slowly across sky then after 11 minutes, 1 of them streaked off towards the east and was gone in 10-12 sec;1996-02-23 12:40:00;11 minutes;Saw 2 points of light moving slowly across sky then after 11 minutes, 1 of them streaked off towards the east and was gone in 10-12 seconds. I was taking a lunchtime walk around an industrial area in Poway, CA on 02/23/96. At approximately 12:40 pm, I was heading in a NNW direction on Stowe Road, 1/4 mile north of Scripps-Poway Pkwy.  I looked up into the sky and noticed a white point of light about 60 degrees above the northern horizon.  It was slowly moving toward the south.  The weather conditions at the time were as follows:  mostly clear skies, scattered cirrus clouds, temperature about 65 degrees, winds from the SSW (both at the surface and aloft), with wind speed about 10 mph at ground level.  By 12:43 pm, the object became stationary at a position about 70 degrees above the northern horizon.  It appeared to hover in that position until 12:45 pm, when another similar object blinked on just to the east of the first object.  At that moment, both objects began to move fairly slowly towards the west, with the first object pulling slightly away from the second.  Both objects appeared to pass under the cirrus clouds in the area.  At 12:49 pm, the first object changed direction towards the SW.  The second object continued to move toward the west.  The distance between the two objects continued to increase to the point where I could no longer keep both of them in a single field of view.  At 12:51 pm, the first object was approximately 50 degrees above the western horizon when it suddenly streaked across the sky from west to east and disappeared over the eastern horizon.  The elapsed time of this high-speed exit from the area was 10-12 seconds.  I immediately looked back to where the other object had been, but it was gone.  I did not see it leave. I have made the following conservative altitude and velocity estimates: 1.  Scattered cirrus clouds at approximately 25000 feet 2.  Both objects were below the cirrus clouds. 3.  Distance travelled by first object during high-speed exit from the area assuming altitude of 15000 feet = 25-75 miles 4.  Estimated velocity of first object during high-speed exit = 6000-18000 mph It is clear to me that these objects were not conventional airplanes, balloons, meteors, stars, etc.  They moved against the wind, hovered and displayed high-speed characteristics beyond anything that I've ever seen or heard.  At no time did I hear any sound from either of the objects.  There was no sonic boom during the high-speed maneuver.  Both objects appeared as white points of light with no other details observed.  They were both clearly under intelligent control.  The sighting took place in an area where there were frequent flybys of Navy F-14 and F-18 fighters returning to Miramar from training exercises over the Pacific.  However, no military or civilian aircraft were seen in the immediate area over the entire duration of the sighting. I believe my estimates of altitude and velocity are conservative, my gut feeling is that these objects may have been at an altitude closer to 25000 feet and the velocity during the high-speed maneuver may have been more like 20000-25000 mph.

I was playing basketball and when I shot, I looked in the air and saw a little dot of light moving between the clouds. It moved forward;2004-06-17 18:30:00;1:45;I was playing basketball and when I shot, I looked in the air and saw a little dot of light moving between the clouds. It moved forwards and back and turned several times. Soon it sped off to the SSE and about 5 minutes later, a helicopter flew in that direction very low (It was a dark military helicopter with a bubble on top of the rotors) Soon after the first helicopter came 2 F/A 18 hornets flying very low and broke the sound barrier going in the same direction. Shortly thereafter, in the same direction, came a large troop-carrying helicpter that was also very dark. i stood in my coul-asac and watched this as it took place and my dad was with me most of the time, he even witnessed the object. If it means anything, this took place after a large-ish earthquake.;32.9728;-117.0379
Two bright objects floating in the sky, all of the sudden dim and fly away.;2006-01-05 21:30:00;20 Minutes;Two bright objects floating in the sky, all of the sudden dim and fly away. At around 9:30 p.m. me and my girlfriend were in a parking lot at a local park just sitting and up in the sky I saw a bright, yellow light. At first I thought it was a really bright star or maybe a planet and I commented on how bright it was because barely any other stars were visible. About 15 minutes later another one of these 'stars' that looked exactly the same appeared above and to the right of the first object, at about a 45 degree angle from it. Now, we thought it was really weird and after about 5 minutes of both of the objects staying in place the second object started to dim and all of the sudden flew to the left and shortly after the first object did the same. It dimmed and flew to the left. We watched them until they disappeared behind some trees. I know it couldn't be a helicoptor or plane because the lights stayed motionless for so long and the glowing of them looked like stars.;32.9728;-117.0379
Blue light object (2 parallel lines, one shorter than the other);2007-03-02 22:30:00;3-4 seconds;Blue light object (2 parallel lines, one shorter than the other) March 2, 2007 around 10:30-11:00pm, I was in my backyard with my dog and I saw a bright blue light go upward, flip over and went downward southeast of Poway, CA.  There was no sound and it was only visible for a few seconds.   It scared my dog because as soon as we saw this she ran to the door and started whining to get back inside.  I stayed outside looking in the direction of the object for at least a few minutes and I did not see it again. I checked the newspaper, etc. and didnâ€™t see that it was reported by others. The appearance of the object was 2 parallel bright blue lines with one of the lines being shorter than the other.  One end of each light line is rounded and the other end pointed with a slight curvature to the line (someone like an elongated teardrop).;32.9728;-117.0379
Blue light which changed to orange travelling fast then disappeared.;2013-11-21 19:20:00;10 seconds;Blue light which changed to orange travelling fast then disappeared. My husband and I were driving home the evening of 11-21-13, when we noticed a blue light traveling across the sky.   The object was traveling at a high rate of speed, was blue in color, and after about 5 seconds the color changed to orange.  It sped across our point of vision, changed colors, and then disappeared as it darted away.;32.9728;-117.0379
Jets chase a ball of yellow-white light.;2017-10-19 20:20:00;30-45 seconds;Jets chase a ball of yellow-white light. So, I decided to take my dog outside to let her do her business, and I heard a jet coming in overhead, so I looked up as I usually do when that happens, and I found the jet and followed it for a couple seconds to see if I could see the jet without its lights blinking.  It never occurred to me at the moment that fighter jets don't usually have all their lights off, save for a singular blinking red light.   Then seemingly out of nowhere, right next to it, I saw a yellowish ball of light appear for around four seconds, flying adjacent to the jet, and then it disappeared.  I kept watching the jet to see if the light would reappear, and then the ball of light came back for the same duration as before and disappeared again, then it came back again for a total of three times... It didn't look like any man-made aircraft I had ever seen before, and it did not make a sound like two jets do when flying in unison.  It didn't have any blinking lights on it when the large yellowish-white ball of light would fade out.  It wasn't very bright and didn't give off a lot of light, but it was clearly visible, and bigger than the jet and a little faster than the jet itself.  It seemed as though jet was chasing it.   Two more fighter jets appeared no more than five minutes after the sighting heading in the same direction.  At the time of writing this, I heard another jet outside and went to look at it and low and behold, it was flying in the same direction as the other jets and the object.  I live relatively near an airbase here in San Diego so the response time of these jets is very fast. My dog did not react to this sighting, as far as I could tell, because my eyes were glued to the sky.;32.9728;-117.0379

Pulsating orange light.;2020-08-23 21:30:00;2 minutes;Pulsating orange light. I am a gas tanker driver and was delivering to Costco when this sighting occurred.  I was already looking in the sky when I noticed a bright flash to my right, similar to a camera flash.  I looked in that direction, which was south west and sighted a dull orange light traveling to the north east.  The light seemed very high up, and seemed similar to a satellite, except for the fact that it was slowly pulsating . The light would dim to almost nothing and then grow bright again about every two seconds.  It also seemed to be traveling in a slight arc rather than a straight line. I know it could not have been a satellite because they only brighten a dim depending on their reflection of the sun beneath our horizon.  This object was self illuminated.  It had no flashing lights.  It only appeared as an orange pulsating light . I followed the light with my eyes until it was no longer visible. A few minutes later I saw an object that probably was a satellite. It was white in color, traveling in the same direction and did not pulsate. It seemed to disappear from sight as it flew into the earths shadow. I was born and raised in San Diego very close to the San Diego airport. I am familiar with commercial air traffic. I also lived close to Miramar air base for a long time and am familiar with military air traffic. This object was neither of these.  I come from a family of law enforcement officers who are trained observers, and it was ingrained in me.;32.9728;-117.0379
