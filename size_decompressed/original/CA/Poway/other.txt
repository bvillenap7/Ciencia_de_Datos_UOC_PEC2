Mom was bringing me to school and once we got in the car I noticed a cloud that seemed to hover just above the tree line that was filled with the colors of the rainbow, although they were always changing, similar to a soap bubble. What was strange was that it was so low, the fact that it was the only thing in the sky, and it was too warm to have ice crystals in the air. I brought my mother's attention to it and we stopped in the could-a-sac long enough to see it change colors multiple times. We then ran to a neighbor's house and pointed it out to her. She didn't believe that what we saw was anything special. Later on we heard that :clouds like this should be reported as a ufo.;32.9728;-117.0379
