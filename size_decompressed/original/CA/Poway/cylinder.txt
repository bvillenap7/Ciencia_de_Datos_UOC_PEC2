Vertical cylinder, gold and hot, bright light on the bottom.;1998-09-22 17:00:00;2 sec;Vertical cylinder, gold and hot, bright light on the bottom. Unlike the one on Sept. 11, this was not reported in the paper the next day. This object was hovering just above the horizon and was a brrilliant gold and was a vertical tube shape. It had a reflective looking bright light on the bottom that seemed to radiate light even though it was not dark out. Unlike the Flash from 9-11, this was not reported and I have found know one who saw what I saw. Thank you.;32.9728;-117.0379
Metallic cylindrical shape object.;2018-12-19 14:00:00;20 minutes;Metallic Cylindrical Shape Object A cylindrical shaped very shiny metallic object moved South very slowly but at considerable altitude.  I thought it was a jet, but it moved way too slowly, no contrail or sound.  It moved around and wouldnâ€™t be seen, then shift positions again revealing a cylindrical shaped object without wings or a tail.  Finally after approximately 20 minutes it disappeared, not being seen again.;32.9728;-117.0379
