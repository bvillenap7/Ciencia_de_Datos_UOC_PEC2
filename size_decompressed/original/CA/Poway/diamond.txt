I was watching tv, and since this was summer break, it was pretty late. I saw out of the top of the window. It had a small group of lights in the center, one red, one yellow, one blue, one green. They were all clearly visible. I would estimate the craft at helicopter height, for it was a cloudy night, and it was below the cover. at the tip of each, well, tip was a light that changed from red, to yello, to white. It was spinning and I could clearly see the shape in the night, it wasn't black, but kind of a dull platinum, the craft I mean, and I ran outside into the cold-a-sac to get a better view. It actually came back towards me a bit before going the direction it was a second a go, when it got to the point where it was about to be hidden behind a hill, it spun very rapidly and all of the lights turned green, then it litterally *poof*ed away, and it left a bit of smoke behind, needless to say, I couldn't sleep for the rest of the morning.
