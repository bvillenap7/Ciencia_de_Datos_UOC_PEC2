Stationary yellow gold lights seen during extended long sighting;2016-08-31 22:00:00;1 hour;Stationary yellow gold lights seen during extended long sighting I watched a cluster of 2 to 7 yellow gold glowing lights stationary near the bay and Corte Madera marsh area.  This activity went on for approximately 1 hour. Sometimes there would be a string of 4 to 6 objects in a row and other times there would be 2 bright objects side by side.  This hour long activity would start to fade out and then start right up again.;37.9253;-122.51392
