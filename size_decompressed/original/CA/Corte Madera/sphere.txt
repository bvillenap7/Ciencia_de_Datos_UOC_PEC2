Shiney objects over North Bay.;2015-09-24 21:00:00;10 minutes;Shiny objects over North Bay. Witnessed multiple lights hovering near Corte Madera bayside hill.  I first noticed it and then had a neighbor coming up the road view it with me.  We watched these lights for about 10 minutes in eastern sky.  We both came to an agreement that these were not airplanes.  Seemed to be over the Bay .;37.9253;-122.51392
