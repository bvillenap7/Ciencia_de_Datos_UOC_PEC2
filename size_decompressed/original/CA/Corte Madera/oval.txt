I had a witness step out onto the road to observe 2 brightly lit objects about a mile in front of us toward the south east horizon.  One object was distinctly bluish white and the other object was golden yellow.  My witness thought they were stars because of how they pulsated.  A couple minutes later these objects were gone and multiple other objects continued to appear and hover.   I also believe I witnessed possibly the same sighting on 1-24-19 at 6:45 P.M from the Golden Gate Bridge toll Plaza as someone reported from Oakland.  A huge yellow light was seen near the SF downtown skyline at exactly 6:45 to 650 P.M.  No one else at the bus stop or tourists or anyone else seemed to be noticing this huge hovering light and a second object appeared briefly and then they just winked out like someone turning off a light switch.;37.9253;-122.51392
