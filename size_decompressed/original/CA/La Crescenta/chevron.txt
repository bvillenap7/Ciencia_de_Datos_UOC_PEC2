long pencil-like fast moving craft wtih steady green lights and a flashing red light;2004-01-18 00:30:00;15 minutes;long pencil-like fast moving craft wtih steady green lights and a flashing red light i was driving down montrose ave. when i saw a strange craft in the sky above me. it was very long, like a pencil, with steady green lights on each end, and a flashing red light in the middle. the craft was far too close to rooftops to be a plane, and it didn't look like a plane anyway... i started following it down montrose ave, but it was going about 55 mph, which was faster than i dared go on a saturday night with all the police around. the craft turned and was going steadily up pennsylvania ave, which is where i turned also. the craft turned again at foothill blvd, which is where i saw many civilians in their cars watching it, and one car followed it along foothill with a video camera. the craft moved quickly and i heard no sound from it, though it was close to rooftops. after following it for awhile, i went home and i saw it cross my street and continue downward, toward honolulu ave. that was the last i saw of it, as i went in my house.;34.2336999999998;-118.2536
