Three circular objects moving at good pace in SW direction.  ((NUFORC Note:  Stars or satellites??  PD));2007-11-14 22:30:00;50 mins;Three circular objects moving at good pace in SW direction La Crescenta , CA . ( Briggs Canyon Area)   On the evening of November 14th, 2007 at approximately 10:30pm, my 16 y/o son and I were outside looking for our cat that ran outside.   While my son searched for the cat, I happened to look up to the sky as it was a clear night and the stars were out.  I noticed two red and blue “Stars” twinkling rather fast and they seemed to be moving.   I went inside to get the binoculars for a closer look, and as I focused on the “Stars”, they appeared to be red/blue circle-shaped objects that were moving southwest.    I would have passed these off as stars had these objects moved together in the earths natural rotation however these two red/blue twinkling objects seemed to be moving towards a third object farther in the distance and got considerably closer during the 45-50 minutes we watched this.  I compared these particular objects to the other stars in the sky, even the bright yellow planet Venus, and there were no other similar objects like the three we were watching.   We watched this phenomenon for about an hour and the two objects were moving at a good pace towards the third object which moved at a slower pace in the same southwest direction.   Ultimately, it appeared that the two larger objects were trying to reach the more distant third object of the same description.   The next evening my son went outside to see if he could witness the same thing and he claims he did.  Same Stars in the same place at the same time.   We are curious.
