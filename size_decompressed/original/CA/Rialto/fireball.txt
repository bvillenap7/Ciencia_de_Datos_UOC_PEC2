I was in my backyard around 8:30-9pm and I look up to the slight NE of my location and see what I think is an airplane going from East to West.  It was moving slowly but the weird part was that it looked like it was on fire.  I see planes all the time and know what flashing lights they have but this was way different.   I was wondering if a plane had an engine fire and was about to come down.  It was flickering like a fire would as it headed West.  Then it got really strange.  It just stopped in its tracks and didn't move except for the fire like flickering.  It stayed in this spot for maybe twenty seconds as I went into the house to get three others to come look at this.  But by the time I went back outside with everyone (5 seconds or so) it was gone and it never reappeared.   Just to add one more thing.  When it stopped I immediately thought it might be a helicopter but I quickly dismissed that because it was way too high up.  But even if it was low enough for a helicopter I would still swear it wasn't one.;34.1205741071429;-117.386761607143
