slow moving object burning and dropping pieces of burning material;1999-08-01 20:00:00;2-3 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The witness may be describing the dramatic event that was seen from Oregon, California, Nevada, and Utah on 01SE99.  The event may have been caused by re-entering space debris, but we are not certain of that.  The report does not indicate which direction the objects were traveling, relative to the observer.  PD)) slow moving object burning and dropping pieces of burning material My apologies for submitting this form twice but the first date I gave was wrong. It was a little over a year ago, in 1999, not 2000. sorry I've never thought of this as a UFO experience but I'm watching a UFO-sightings show on the Travel Channel and one of the things that people in the show had video taped in Florida is the exact thing that I saw from my backyard. I had borrowed a night vision scope from a friend and I was playing with it in my backyard just after the sun had set. I often look at the night-time sky and I live right under the approach path of Ontario airport. Looking north/north-west over my rooftop I saw a sputtering light which looked like something burning fiercely, like magnesium, but not as bright. It was moving too slowly (in my opinion) to be a jetliner, and it wasn't losing any altitude. When I saw it I wasn't looking throught the night-vision scope but the magnitude diminished quickly and I began using the scope which had magnification as well as light-amp. Through the scope I could see the sputtering light very well and before it stopped I saw at least two to three small flare-type objects fall from it.  This is when I realized that the main thing was moving very slowly, like a blimp or something.  The flares would vanish within a couple of seconds and were not nearly as bright as the main light, and shortly after they dropped from the main part the  whole thing sort of faded away until nothing was visible through the scope or without the scope. I kept looking for something in that direction for 30-45 minutes and saw nothing.and at no time did I see any structure attatched to any of the lights. All of this, in my estimation, was taking place at about 2000 feet in altitude and I think about 20-30 miles away, possibly over the high desert to the northwest of Wrightwood.  I must say however that my ability to estimate values, distances, and altitudes has never been great. I expected to see something in the paper the next day about a airplane/military accident or even on the news shows that night, but nothing ever came of it. So, there it is, I hope this helps.  I would be more than happy to attempt to submit a mor! e detail ed report if you like. I'm only sorry I didn't think more of it when it happened, and I could draw from a fresh memory. Thanks. By the way, I was reading some of the local reports and there is one in Fontana about 10 years ago- a red light 300-500 feet up- stationary, as rain clouds passed by it didnt move...yadda yadda.. Myself and a buddy saw a bunch of people out of their cars in slight rain and looking up, so we stopped and saw that red light.  But quite frankly think it was a light attatched to a kite or something.. but who knows.;34.1205741071429;-117.386761607143

Ziggzagging white and red/white lights over Rialto, CA;2008-07-12 23:40:00;2.5 hours plus;Ziggzagging white and red/white lights over Rialto, CA Began seeing only two lights up by the mountains then over the town.  The lights would become dimmer and stronger and would separate and move close together.  Progressively, more appeared throughout the hours.  There were about 3 red/white lights and the others were just white- they all looked like stars.  The white ones hovered though stayed in place whereas the red/white lights ziggzagged slowly up to the white stars then would move slowly in a circle around the white lights.;34.1205741071429;-117.386761607143

We saw a strange light traveling north which in itself is unusual for any typical a/c.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;3 minutes;It was around 6:00 pm we saw a strange light traveling north which in itself is unusual for any typical aircraft.  The light seemed to illuminate the surrounding area&lt  which is why I would describe it as orb like. It was certainly out of the norm. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.

10+ glowing objects flying south west over the night sky.;2017-11-04 03:00:00;20+;10+ glowing objects flying southwest over the night sky Walked out side to have a smoke, always take the time to look up noticed what I thought was a high flying plane.  Then I noticed another and another first thinking they could be stars and the clouds are moving tonight.  So I placed a box on the wall next to me, hid the object behind the box so out of sight, and wiated for it to pop up it did.  Proving to me the objects where moving in the night sky. Stuck around looked around the sky noticing more all over reminding me of the fleet over Mexico City.;34.1205741071429;-117.386761607143
