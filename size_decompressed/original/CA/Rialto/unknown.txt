I reported a sighting to George filer approx aug. 2002 along with photos that are still on his sight. It was extremely hot during week of 23rd july, 04 in rialto, ca and i could not sleep. So i went out to get fresh air at about 2 am when just above the mountains north of my house a huge and extremely bright light apearred. larger and brighter than anything i have seen in sky before except sun and moon. I watched this enormous and bright light with and without binoculars for an hour as it slowly traveled in a southern direction. on occasion there seemed to be a green glow surrounding light. it then began to fade to nothing and then reappear as bright as it was before and it continued this for about 5 minutes until disappearing completely. I did take several pictures from a camara that was in my company van for accident purposes. They have not been developed yet. Note that 1st sighting was offically investagated by mufon with no real answers.;34.1205741071429;-117.386761607143
