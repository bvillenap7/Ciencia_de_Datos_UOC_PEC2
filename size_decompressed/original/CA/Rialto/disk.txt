I noticed the strange craft, then showed it to my girlfriend, of whom then witnessed the entire event along with me.  We use our spa at least every other night, so we are familiar the activities  and the aircraft in our area.  The round shaped craft approached from the west, headed eastward and going slow and was at a high altitude. It was a very bright green glow until it was overhead, and at this point, the four green lights were distinguishable and then completely came to a full stop. The lights on the craft went out and two red to blue lights illuminated.  (two jets approached into the area)  We noticed that the craft went dark and then we saw very bright sparks, like thruster sparks (red) shoot out and the craft , and then went from being still, to gaining altitude at an angle, and then it dissappeared into the sky. ADDENDUM SUBMITTED BY ORIGINAL WITNESS: Previously submitted on 4-19-99 I have previously submitted our report on the events that took place on Monday evening.  A few people have spoken to me regarding this event that took place and we do not see why others shouldn't know the truth.  We are comfortable knowing the truth of what we witnessed and have spoken to another individual who has also seen it, on the same night.  I anticipate that there will be many others that have witnessed this but failed to report it through the lack of knowing what to do.  We thank you for listening to us and am additionally glad that someone in Lake Wood saw it too.  It confirmed what we reported to you that night and the direction that it came from (Los Angeles Area).  I had to check the location out in a map the next day and was please for what I learned then.;34.1205741071429;-117.386761607143
