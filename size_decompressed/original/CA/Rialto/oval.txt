LARGE SLOW MOVING BRIGHT LIGHT TRAILING SPARKS THEN VANISHES.;2013-02-17 23:45:00;3-5 seconds;LARGE SLOW MOVING BRIGHT LIGHT TRAILING SPARKS THEN VANISHES DATE: FEB 17 2013  TIME: APPROX 11:30 -11:45 PM LOCATION: RIALTO, CA (5 MI.WEST OF SAN BERNARDINO, CA.)  DURATION: APPROX 3 SEC. I WAS AT WORK WORKING ON A LOADER FOR MONDAY AND HAD JUST PARKED FACING EAST ALONGSIDE MY SHOP, MY ATTENTION WAS CAUGHT BY A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE EASTERN SKY OVER (I'M ASSUMING) SAN BERNARDIONO.  WHEN THE OBJECT FIRST APPEARED IT WAS BRIGHT    AT FIST BUT BECAME BRIGHTER THEN SPARKS BEGAN FALLING FROM THE BOTTOM AND TRAILED BACKWARDS AS THE THE OBJECT MOVED FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND THEN VANISHED.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT SHOOTING STAR (METEOR), BUT IT WAS RATHER LARGE AND PRETTY SLOW.  THE ONLY WAY I CAN THINK TO GIVE ANY KIND OF REFERENCE WOULD BE TO HOLD YOUR ARMS STRAIT OUT WITH INDEX FINGERS POINTED STRAIT UP,  APPROX 8-9 BETWEEN FINGERS (FOR DISTANCE TRAVELED), AND APPROX 1/4 TH   THE SIZE OF THE FINGERNAIL (FOR SIZE).  THE  EVENT LASTED APPROX 3-5 SEC.  IT MADE NO SOUND.;34.1205741071429;-117.386761607143
