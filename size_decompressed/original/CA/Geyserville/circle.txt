White orb hovering in sky.;2015-05-29 16:00:00;4 hours;White orb hovering in sky White object in the sky looking SSE from Lake Sonoma at an inclination of approx 60 degrees.  No stars when the object was first noticed, but the 3/4 moon had already risen in the SW.  Object was brighter than the daytime moon, looked to be extremely high in the atmosphere.  Was too big to be a star. Object remained stationary as compared to the horizon, while the moon progressed through the sky.  The early stars also appeard in the sky near sunset, and the object still remained stationary, even though the moon and stars progressed across the sky.  Object disappeared as soon as the sun had set. Used 10x binoculars, but could not make out any distinct markings, other than it appeared to have a round shadow cast from the sun, and potentially a red marking in the upper right;38.7141;-122.8803
