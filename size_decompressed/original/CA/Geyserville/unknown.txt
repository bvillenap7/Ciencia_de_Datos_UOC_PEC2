I must have been about 17 years old and a friend and I were just out and about looking for some trouble to get into. We were only about 100-200 ft from my house down our driveway, and standing in the middle of the road.  We noticed a light approaching from the north, just white, but very bright.  We contiued to watch it for a few minutes and it came closer and closer.  We couldn't hear anything but we were pretty sure it was a helicopter with its landing lights on or somthing.  As it came even closer the light shut off, and all we could see were a few green lights. We both just stood and watched in amazment as it came right over us probably only about 100 ft up in the air.  We could feel the air around us moving and a wind picked up, but still hardly ANY SOUND. All we could hear was a chopping sound like a helicopter would make but only faintly. It was like a slow Cha Cha Cha sound and it felt like I was being watched. We both ran as fast as we could back to the house and went inside to tell my brother.  He didn't belive us and didn't hear anyhting. To this day I think it was some sort of high tech stealth helicopter, but it scared the crap out of me and my friend. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  Object might have been a helicopter, altered for use by special operations forces.  Such aircraft are specially designed to be unusually quiet.  However, it seems unlikely that the military would operate the craft over populated areas.  PD));38.7141;-122.8803
