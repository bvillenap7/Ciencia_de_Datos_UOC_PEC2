My child and I saw a jet flying streight up very fast, the jet soon leveled out and flew west, that is when we saw a vertical silver object stationary in the sky, next to the jet it looked very large, the jet's underside was red, as it went by the object heading west another jet traveled east. We saw the object move north, I glanced away for a second to see what the jets were doing. when I looked back the object was gone. The object had no lights, left no trail, no windows, looked more like a vertical capsul ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

It resembled a sun if you could see a sun at night.  I could see that it was red and it was yellow and it was glowing.  I could see the rays coming out which was more a reflection of the light.  The rays were coming out sort of like how a sun would reflect light all the way around.  It was to the right of the Hesperia  airport lights which are tall and red.   The object appeared straight overhead to the right over the mountain.  It was over the mountain and I know there's no tower on top of that mountain.then as quick as I saw it it faded rather quickly and in three seconds it was gone.  It was large like more than half the size of a full moon.  I see the full moon a lot over this mountain so I kind of know the size for comparison.  There was no noise no sound it just was in one spot.   I would also add that it was rather beautiful in color.  It was very bright.  I also have Skyview so I was using my SkyView to see if this objects could be identified as a particular star.  This light was seen in the east sky.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261
