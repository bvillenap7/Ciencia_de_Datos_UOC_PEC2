Three pulsing lights, flying low and fast.;2009-11-09 18:40:00;4-5 seconds;Three pulsing lights, flying low and fast. It was 6:40pm-ish when the three of us saw the lights go across the sky.  There were three lights in a line, flying pretty low and fast, from north to south.  (many planes were in the sky also, so it was easy to compare, and these looked completely different.)   Each light was large elliptical shaped and seemed to be moving independently, while flying in formation.  There also seemed to be a pulse that went back and forth through all of them.  It pulsed and shimmered, as if you were seeing them through a mirage or a film of steam.  Before the three of them disappeared behind some clouds, the last light seemed to speed up and align itself to the right of the front light, forming a triangle.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261
UFO close to Oak hills;2018-12-16 20:50:00;1 minute;UFO close to Oak hills Driving up cajon pass, after the 138 I notice 3 lights up ahead before going up the big hill.  There are no lights there.  Once we got closer it started to move like a helicopter, but it wasn't  a helicopter. I thought the thing was going to crash into the mountain.  My two daughters saw and my mother.
