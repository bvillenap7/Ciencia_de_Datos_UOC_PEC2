Then dissapered in the center of rotating diamond with sequinse red, yellow ,& green lights. This happend above the Marianna mountain chain in the southern Mojave dessert. The verry next day I was watching SIGHTINGS and seen a report of the same exact UFO that I saw, ECEPT this sighting was in England! At first it stood still in the sky,sorta hovering there. It then shoot to the right & back to the left at rappid speeds, it did this for about ten minutes. In the upper right hand of the sky there was this diamond shape of lights red, yellow, and green going around the diamond in seqeunce (rotating) the orange globe then disapered into the center of the diamond. This seems very short,it took about ten minutes for the whole thing to happen. It left me trembling, & my freind crying. Like I said, I saw the same exact thing on SIGHTINGS the very next day ecept the sighting was in England. I'm not sure if there were one or two crafts,I'm sure of the globe bieng seperate from the diamond, but the diamond seemed hollow in the center, because I could see stars through it.My freind said she never talks about it, because no-one believes her. I refuse to stop talking about it, because what ever it was & who ever was behind the controlls, I saw it! and no-one can take that from me. I dont care if people dont believe me. I know what I saw,& it was'nt venus,mars,or jupiter, no it was'nt a weather baloon iether.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261
A bright blue object that streaked across the southern sky from east to west.;1998-02-27 19:35:00;10 sec.;A bright blue object that streaked across the southern sky from east to west. I was indoors and happened to catch it pass to the south of my location through a large picture wiindow. It was traveling from east to west at a high speed. The color of the object was blue and it had a tail behind it. My guess is that it was a large meteor that I witnessed. No sound since I was indoors at the time. And I couldn't see if it looked like it impacted on the ground either. Kind of unusual to see a large meteor like that this time of the year. Haven't heard of any scheduled showers to be seen. Could be like what was reported over Colorado recently. If you are interested in hearing about a sighting that occurred on 08/17/69 over the San Fernando Valley of California then pleaase let me know and I will post it here. That sighting of seven large orange colored objects in formation was definitely much closer and had some very strange aspects to it. I witnessed it along with about six other persons. At the time, we did report it to the Air Force and all they said was, We don't know what they are.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261

From here that would be in the direction of Fontana or Ontario. Going from East to West very low above the horizon. Might have been in the vicinity of the Cajon Pass or even further away than that. Was seen to glow for about five seconds where I believe it slipped below the mountains that are directly to the south of here and could not be seen anymore.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261
