Huge Black Triangular Craft hovers over the 15 Freeway in High Desert,CA. 1996;1996-11-13 19:45:00;6 min.;Huge Black Triangular Craft hovers over the 15 Freeway in High Desert,CA. 1996 I saw a large black triangular craft hovering low and silently over the 15 Freeway and a major intersection cross street in the Hesperia/Victorville, CA. area of the high desert. There were three miliary style but unmarked black or dark green helicoptors escorting (apparently)the object. I thought 1rst they were making a movie on ufos. Then I thought it was a military test flight of an antigravity ship due to the helicopters. This was about 1000-1500 ft off the ground, light from businesses below would slightly reflect off the dull black metallic surface. It was about size of 1-2 football fields in area. People (70) met soon afterwards at the Pyramid Bookstore, which is now closed. Others have told me that when it left hovering, it moved very quickly accross horizon in seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261
orange triangle with 4 lights;2004-01-09 19:00:00;3 minutes;orange triangle with 4 lights I was looking in the eastern sky when i thought i saw a planet or star, because it was orange in color. I kept observing it when it moved across the sky turning into a triangle that was orange in color and had 4 lights that were divided in to 4 sections from top to bottom. They light up each section at a time then went off. This one from the eastern sky joined another one that was hovering in the western sky and were side by side. I finally got my husband who saw the same thing as me. we both seen them side by side and i looked through my binoculars and the lights faded slow off and on for a short time then they completly shut off and that was the last time i saw them. Incidentially a friend of mine seen the same thing over the mts of san bernardino the following monday night at around 9 pm and he witnessed 4 of them in a row.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261

3 red/orangy dot craft spotted over the city of Hesperia california;2013-08-01 22:00:00;7 seconds;3 red/orangy dot craft spotted over the city of Hesperia california It was a late night on August 1, 2013, around 22:00. I was with a friend, my and my cousin accompanying my brother to take his girlfriend home walking.  We were closing in, into her house and in the distance about 4.5 miles away in the sky I see 3 orangy red dots in a triangular shape.  The dots were barely visible because it was far away. It was going at about 45 miles an hour, then it made a “U” turn and went the other way.  i wanted to continue looking at it, but unfortunately there was a tree nearby so it prevented us from seeing where it went.  After i passed the tree, it was gone. I’m pretty sure it was not a star, nor a helicopter, nor a a plane.  I’m 100% sure of it.  Even my brother agrees. Only him and I were the witnesses.   Nobody else saw anything.  I asked him, ”Did you see that!?” Him: “YES!” (Then he ran passed the tree and left us behind to see if he could still see it). As for myself, I stood there in shock.  My first UFO.  I hope it isn’t my last either.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261
