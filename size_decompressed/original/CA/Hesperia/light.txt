zero to very fast moving star and meteor glows the night green. Crash & burn at Vandenburg '95;1995-06-15 20:00:00;60 seconds;zero to very fast moving star and meteor glows the night green. Crash & burn at Vandenburg '95 So long ago now i can't remember the exact date, but but this was the only sighting of anything odd that i ever had and thought i'd describe it here. Summer of '95 laying in the pool looking up into the stars.......... i noticed one of them was moving. Thinking it was probably just an aircraft of some sort i followed it (visibly) for about 10 or 15 seconds and it stopped. I kept my eye on it so not to mix it up with the stars as it was about the same size and brightness of most. After watching it where it stopped for another 10 or 15 seconds the star accelerated at what appeared to be 90 deg. direction from which it original came from.... leaving a streak and promptly disappeared. I continued to watch the sky thinking i would see something else and approximately 15 or 20 minutes later i did. I believe it was a meteor coming into the atmosphere from the south east towards the north west at the same place as i just saw the moving star (as if it were marking the location). All this taking place (generally) over Edwards AFB and also near China lake Naval station...... i always wrote it off as possibly a military ufo, but a couple years later i heard a story right hear on nuforc about and object that crashed (touched down)and burned on the coast near vandenburg for a week. One last thing.... my cousin i found out just recently saw that so called meteor that lit up the sky green so bright it could have been day time, so i'm thinking there were atleast more people that saw that to possibly comfirm the date. My opinion is....if this star was a craft from this world then we have some wicked awesome technology.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261
Fire like light moved like if gravity had no effect on it. Then it became a dot to hide but it acted the same way.;2004-01-17 10:00:00;5 min;Fire like light moved like if gravity had no effect on it. Then it became a dot to hide but it acted the same way. I was driving down the street when I saw a fire like light in the sky. I thought it was a plane, but it was to red. It was standing still. I stopped to take a better look. Then it started to move very slowly. The strange thing about it was that it didnt look that high but it was a little light. It moved north. I followed it. It spead up and then slowed down real fast. I was in a main street when I started to follow and ended up in a lonely road. I flashed my high lights to see if it would see me. It flew over me and stoped. I was frightened. I stuck my head out the window to see it clear. It was weird hard to explain. Then the light became a tiny dot. It seemed like it was trying to hide. If I had not seen it turn into that tiny dot I would have never Known it was there. The dot moved the same as when it was big. I followed it until the road ended. Then I had to turn around and I lost it.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261
A small craft size light moving south to north at 9:32 PM on Thursday, July 12, 2007 over Hesperia, Ca.;2007-07-12 21:32:00;4 seconds;A small craft size light moving south to north at 9:32 PM on Thursday, July 12, 2007 over Hesperia, Ca. Observed a low illumination light with an indistinct shape traveling in a straight line from approximate south to approximate north at an apparent altitude of 2000 to 5000 feet with no deviation in flight path and accompanied by no sound. Its speed at the apparent altitude was comparable to how a fighter jet might appear at a couple thousand feet and cranking it on. There was no radiating light from the object, no tail and no trail of debris such as is common with a low level meteor.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261

Bright white light in the north eastern sky of Claifornia High Desert,changes to small red light , disapears.;2009-03-14 22:30:00;5 min;Bright white light in the north eastern sky of Claifornia High Desert,changes to small red light , disapears. The UFO that my husband and I witnessed was a bright white light.  We thought it was a planet at first.  We continued to watch it though and it continued to descend slowly downward for about 3 minutes, at about the 4th minute it changed from being large white light to a small red light, and then it shot out towards the Southern desert of Nevada.  Our location was the high desert of Southern California.  We were located in Hesperia, CA.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261

Very bright object in front of big dipper disappeared to nothing on 6/13/10 at 22:24 hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Iridium satellite? PD));2010-06-13 22:24:00;7 seconds;Very bright object in front of big dipper which disappeared to nothing on 6/13/10 at 22:24 hours. Observing the area toward the front or opening of the big dipper at a distance equivalent to an extended hand width to the east at about 22:24 hrs, saw what appeared as Venus appears in a clear sky when it's closest to earth- except larger or brighter.  About 3 seconds after spotting it, it began diminishing in size.  The brightness appeared to remain the same and it appeared to just get smaller or retreat to a more distant position over about 4 seconds until it was gone.  No erratic movements or anything, just a very bright presence appearing in a location I am not use to seeing any extrememly bright stars or other astrological bodies.

Bright orange lights in the sky.;2013-12-31 21:30:00;10 minutes;Bright orange lights in the sky. After a delayed Christmas gift exchange at our house, my daughter and her boyfriend were walking her brother and his girlfriend out to their car.  She came running in to get me saying there was something in the sky.  I went out and there were probably 20 bright orange lights on the horizon against the San Bernardino Mountains south toward Crestline, CA. I assumed they were putting out a brush fire in the mountains but as I watched the lights slowly rose up so that they were above the mountains.  I ran into the house to get my husband.  When he came out there were probably only about 10 left in the sky and as we watched they disappeared one by one in no discernible pattern. I checked the next day and there were no fires in the area nor had Vandenburg AFB launched anything that night according to their web site. Although it was New Year's Eve, none of us had anything alcoholic to drink.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261
Very bright pulsating light that moved in erratic trajectory and seemed to teleport through the sky.;2016-03-14 22:50:00;5-7 minutes;Very bright pulsating light that moved in erratic trajectory and seemed to teleport through the sky. My brother and I were driving due East on Main street.  My brother, who was behind the wheel, pointed out a bright flashing light above us, which was moving from North to South. I dismissed it as a small private plane as there is an airport near by.  However, when I looked at the bright flashing light, it made an abrupt 180 degrees turn.   At that moment, I thought it might be a drone.  However, further observation of the object made it clear that it was not a drone nor an airplane, or a helicopter.  The light was extremely bright, not typical of an airplane flashing lights.  It pulsated in a rapid three flashes pattern without any sound.   Our destination coincided with the trajectory of the object.  I kept my eyes on the object trying to figure out what it was.  What we observed while driving after it was something un-explainable.  The object seemed to skip by disappearing for a distance and reappearing further away, but not in a straight line.  I told my brother to pull over so we can observe the object.  At this point the object turned drastically to the West, again without clear logical flying pattern.  I told my brother to roll down the window to see if we can hear anything.  There was no sound.  The object continued to fly West then it seemed to hover in the distance.  It hung in the air for about 10 seconds.  The light seemed to dim as if the object flew away in a very fast manner, then the object shot directly up.   Few seconds later it reappeared slightly North-West.  At this time we heard a helicopter in the distance and saw a helicopter light, which my brother thought appeared to be searching for something.  The object quickly disappeared toward Right Wood mountains.  It seemed to disappear and reappear.  Best way to describe it was a short distance teleportation.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261
