a very fast, non-flashing, non blinking, semi bright object caught my eye..  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-15 20:34:00;5 minutes;I was out looking at Venus and stars with my telescope when a very fast, non-flashing, non blinking, semi bright object caught my eye.. upon further observation I began to notice that it was flying in the same pattern as another one of the same objects that was a bit ahead of it.. as I kept looking I began noticing more and more of these objects following in the EXACT same pattern at the same speed.  Just emerging out of the dark sky and then fading off into distance.  The distance between each object was perfect and the speed they were traveling at was identical.  I came in and got my father and we went and watched the rest of the object fly by... we watched about 15-20 of these fly by in the night sky.  Unlike anything I’ve ever seen…;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261
