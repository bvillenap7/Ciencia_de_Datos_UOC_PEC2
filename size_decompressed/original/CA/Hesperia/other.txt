High Altitude partially luminescent rocket contrail. In the direction towards Lucerne Valley.;1999-02-02 06:05:00;10-15 minutes;((NUFORC:  A peculiar meteor was seen over California and Nevada at approximately 0604 hrs. on this date, as well.  Most likely a coincidence.)) High Altitude partially luminescent rocket contrail. In the direction towards Lucerne Valley. I observed a partially luminescent rocket contrail just before sunrise in the eastern direction from Hesperia. Vandenburg is directly West of here approximately 100 miles. Normally when Vandenburg launches something like that it shows up above the far western horizon. It looked as though the contrail went into a complete 360 degree circle before disppearing. I've never seen anything like this to the east of here before and I never did see the actual object that left the trail.;34.4180749170541;-117.307945587261
