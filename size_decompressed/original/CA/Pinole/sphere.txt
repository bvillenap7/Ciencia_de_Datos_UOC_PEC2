Silent sphere overhead becomes stationary in sky;2011-06-14 21:15:00;16 min;Silent sphere overhead becomes stationary in sky On 06/14/11 at 9:15 pm, I went outside and glanced up at the sky.  There was a very bright sphere coming over the hill from the south.  It moved at a medium pace as it continued north.  As it flew overhead it was obvious that it was flying at a lower altitude than most planes.   I went and got my wife to come outside and see the light.  She came outside and watched as it passed overhead.  We both noticed it was silent.  Absolutely silent.   Also, the light faced us during the entire pass above.  It continued north on steady course veering sharply to the left 2 times.   At what I estimate to be 10 degrees above the horizon it became stationary in the sky.  The light then pulsed several times.  It sat motionless for more than 10 minutes before I came inside to report.  It is still in the sky now at 9:40 pm.;37.9964;-122.2901
