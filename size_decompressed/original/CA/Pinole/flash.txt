Bright Orange Object;2007-03-25 00:00:00;7 minutes;Bright orange object that was really bright in itself, but did not cast any glow.  Newspapers don't have any info. This was really strange. The light stayed solid for about 3 or 4 minutes, then began to dim. Once it had almost disappeared, there was a bright white light, and then it was gone.;37.9964;-122.2901
