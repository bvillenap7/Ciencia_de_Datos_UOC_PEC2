Clear blue sky. 3 black circles or balls flying in a triangle formation toward the North at a constant rate of speed.  It was hard to tell if they were small and low or large and high.  My instinct tells me they were large and very high up.  They moved faster than an airplane but not so fast as to not be able to see them clearly.  There was no glint or glimmer that you would see from an airplane and there was very clearly blue sky between the circles or balls. They made no sound.  There was nobody around to witness this.;37.9964;-122.2901
