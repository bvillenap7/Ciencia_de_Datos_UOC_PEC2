bright red light moving slowly eastward;2003-05-10 22:10:00;2220;bright red light moving slowly eastward How would we get info on an object moving in the sky over the SF Bay Area on Saturday Night at about 2200 hours moving from [estimated] magnetic 270degrees towards 90degrees.  It moved very slowly  while overhead and appeared to hover, although that could be its appearance as it moved directly away from us.   The feature was a large bright red light.  It approached from the west and moved slowly over head.  When it got farther east it appeared to hover, then move slightly north and then quickly move away and disappear. It diminished  like a fading red star.  IT was significantly larger to the human eye than Jupiter appeared  that night and while it was directly overhead, the red light was about the size of [an airliner at about 4000 feet altitude].  It was not possible to estimate the altitude of the object.  It was just smaller than the size of the moon that evening (about 1/2 full size moon).  The only discernable shape was the round red light. Unlike an airplane or helicopter to which you can tell a light is attached. We noticed that it made no sound.  There was no other sound or moving aircraft in the sky at the time.   There was no other air traffic in the sky until about 2230 hrs.  It seems to us that the airspace was cleared in preparation for this object.  We would like to find out what it was.   I have done a cursory review of the Vandenburg AFB website to review any possible launch schedules, but saw nothing that matched.
