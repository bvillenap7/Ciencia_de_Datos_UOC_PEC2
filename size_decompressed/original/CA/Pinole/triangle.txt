Three objects in trianglar pattern moving in unison.  ((NUFORC Note:  Smudges on windshield that photo was taken through.  PD));2019-02-16 14:57:00;Caught in photo;Three objects in trianglar pattern moving in unison. Did not see it in person.  I only caught in photo.  Three separate objects appear in a triangular pattern.  They are blurry though the photo is clear.  When I replay the photo on bounce the objects move in unison.   Objects appear to be black or dark in color.  This size appears to be the size of a small aircraft.  If they were birds you would see their wings in movement while the photo moves Just as you see the car on the road moving. ((NUFORC Note:  Smudges on windshield that photo was taken through.  Not alien spacecraft, we believe.  PD));37.9964;-122.2901
