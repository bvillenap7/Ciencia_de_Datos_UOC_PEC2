I was viewing the full moon through a spotting scope with my wife, we were picking out the details on the moon's surface.  After viewing the moon for fifteen minutes or longer, I saw what looked to me like a moving satellite and when it quickly changed direction, I said to my wife, you've got to see this, as it changed direction again.   When she looked through the scope and reported what she witnessed, I was happy to hear that she also saw the object but it was moving in the opposite direction before it disappeared.   Here are the details:  at 19:37 hours starting at three o'clock from the moon, moving left to right, moving below the moon at seven o'clock.   First in a straight line at a downward 250 degree, then swung up at a 300 degree for a short distance before swinging its direction downward to a 230 degree.  The turns were not like sharp turn, but more like a lazy turns and that is how I saw it.   My wife's viewing starting at eight o'clock moving with an upwa! rd sweeping movement, right to left in the direction of the moon at six o'clock position to the moon, then disappearing out of sight.   We were viewing this at a 6,225 Ft elevation, an at a 45 degree temp. and a very clear night with visible stars.;34.214;-117.1096
