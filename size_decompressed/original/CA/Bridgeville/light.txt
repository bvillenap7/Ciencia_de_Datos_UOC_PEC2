Bright Light In Sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));2009-01-12 18:30:00;12 Hours;Bright Light In Sky Date: 12/01/2008 – 01/12/2009  Time: 6:00 PM – 5:30 AM  Duration: Approx 12 Hours  For the past month myself and several witnesses have observed a bright light coming from approx 215 degrees south.  This light will appear about 3 hours after dark and slowly move across the sky in a south to north direction.   The light moves way too slowly to be a plane or satellite, and is not always present in the sky, which rules out a star, as previously thought.   On occasion I have seen this light move south to north quickly and then return to its original location.   The light does have star light characteristics but its unusual movement and brightness have aroused the curiosity of local witnesses.
