A small greenish light then appeared at the center of the object.  The red and white lights at this time began to flash red horizontally and white vertically in a cross-like pattern.  A brighter light at the top of the object shone onto the top half of the object, it wasn't metallic or shiny in appearance but was of greyish color.
