Objects entered from the north and quickly traversed the entire horizon before doing a looping maneuver and streaking back off to the north, and disappeared;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603

UFO over Disneyland.;2009-10-10 20:30:00;5 mins;UFO over Disneyland. We were at Disneyland waiting in line to get in a ride, when I saw a light in the sky glowing with different colors and moving at a slow speed. After observing the object moving, it change directions at a 90 degrees and then stopped. Later the lights turned white and began to fade. Several people in line also saw the object, including my buddies but we decided not to comment about the incident.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603

Red light in sky dropping flares;2012-09-11 00:00:00;5 minutes;Red light in sky dropping flares I was driving home from work approx at 11:55 pm on the 91 fwy westbound and as I was exiting the fwy  to my left I noticed a red light in the sky.   I thought it was a airplane or a helicopter.  It was distant, like a few cities away.    As I was pulling into my house I noticed it much more brighter.  I live in Anaheim and this light had to be hoovering over Orange, Santa Ana area.   I kept staring at it because it was still so at first I thought it was a star but too red to be a star so then I thought it was a helicopter and red lights were on.    Then I was getting off the car, still looking at it and I then seen something that looked like red flares dropping down from it.   I stayed frozen looking at it and the first thought that came to me is that its some type of aircraft with a bomb or something.   I started shaking cause I was so scared but came in my house and told my 12 yr daughter to come outside with me, that I wanted her to see something in the sky.   She rushed outside with me and it was no longer there.  I looked all around in the sky but there was nothing that looked like what I seen.  I would say that the duration since the time I noticed it and the last I saw it was about 3 minutes.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Bright Copper color light moving over Anaheim CA sky;2012-09-26 19:40:00;about 5 minutes;Bright Copper color light moving over Anaheim CA sky Object came out of nowhere into the same path as other aircraft traffic, at first it moved towards us like an aircraft but then the color of the UFOs lights did not match those of an aircraft. It had a copper color to it and was very bright in color!    At first it moved like an aircraft but it did not match any shape to any type of aircraft.   The object moved in the sky, but then it came to a stop and started to hover at that same time it proceeded to move up like an elevator would.   I am more then positive it was not a helicopter because the altitude of the aircraft was just too high. And living in the city of Anaheim I can say, I've seen my share of helicopters!    Then its lights then started to dim in the same sense as a flame would do when struck with air.  It did that for about a minute disappearing and then reappearing while moving just a little to the side, before completely disappearing;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
A bright star-like white light suddenly appeared around 8 a.m., a dark shaft appeared hanging down from it, then vanished.;2013-07-12 08:00:00;5 seconds;A bright star-like white light suddenly appeared around 8 a.m., a dark shaft appeared hanging down from it, then vanished. I was facing N. in the east Anaheim area. In what seemed to be in the far N. (Simi Valley?) area, at high altitude in a clear sky with low-lying clouds (not far from sunrise) I was watching the sky and a bright white star like light appeared, as if Mars times 10 in brightness. It seemed to move slightly south before a dark rod appeared to hang down from it, about 7 times the height of the star-form, then abruptly vanished.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Star light in the sky.;2014-07-05 23:00:00;5 minutes;Star light in the sky The object looked like a semi-bright star in the south east sky. The color of the object matched the color of the night stars.   At first, I thought the object to be a star, it did not move in the night's sky.  Looking away for a couple minutes, I looked back, and the object was gone.   I do not believe the object was a plane.  I am leaning more toward the object was of Earth, not alien.

Light in the sky.;2015-05-01 23:50:00;1 minute;The City of Anaheim had its annual Cinco de Mayo fair so I went with my friends, we left to go to the packing house (Food Court by city hall) on our way out my friends and I decided to go get ice cream.   While we were walking to the car we stop in the middle of the parking talking about snow station (the ice cream parlor) they had their backs towards the parking lot, I was facing the parking lot.    My friends were having their own conversation so I dozed off, I looked up into the sky and I saw this bright dot of light in the sky, I assumed it was a star, but then the light dashed across the sky and disappeared.   Later on, I started think about the strange light I kept trying to make my self believe it was a star but I live in the city I rarely see stars in the sky, and if it was a shooting star it would burn out but it didn't.  It just whe straight and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
White orb flying over Anaheim, CA;2015-09-07 04:59:00;Several hours;White orb flying over Anaheim, CA I had just parked my car, when i noticed a white orb moving slowly, but remained in the same place.   I started to record it and take pictures, but the camera has poor quality images.   There was no sound coming from that object.   A man who was running away from the police passed by and also noticed the light but he was so paranoid that he thought it was the police looking for him.  (I say this because he comes out in one of the videos and the sound is of a helicopter flying nearby).;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Solid Green lights then Solid Red zig zagging across the sky.;2015-10-21 19:03:00;4 minutes;Solid Green lights then Solid Red zig zagging across the sky At about 7:00 I saw 2 bright solid green lights about 10 miles out in the south sky.  Being an ex-pilot I thought it was weird because usually a plane will have a red light and  green.  Ex. (red right returning) this didn’t.  I kept my eye on it and all of a sudden the lights turned a solid red and streaked towards me at a tremendous speed and stopped about 2 miles away.  It then turned to Green and hovered.  Then a solid Red light and streaked west about a mile and hovered.  Now I cant remember what lights were showing but it was either a solid red or green.  Then it streaked east about another 7-10 miles and hovered.  Then back west about 3 miles and finally started moving away and lowering its altitude until it moved below a tree line from my house.  This was silent and very swift.  We have fighter jets that fly over our house at times and these are not even as swift as these lights were.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603

Satellite-looking object acts strange over Disneyland. (Disneyland UFO);2016-06-08 21:10:00;2 minutes;Satellite-looking object acts strange over Disneyland. (Disneyland UFO) I was at Disneyland with my friends for grad night.  We were outside of a ride waiting in line when I looked up at the sky to see the stars.  I saw what appeared to be a satellite.  It was headed south/southwest and was a reddish orange color.   My friend and I both watched it for a minute or so before it began to act unusual.  It began to zigzag and speed up and slow down.  It even stopped and started at one point.   At this point my friend looked away and the object stopped a second time.  It turned from a reddish-orange to yellow and let out a sky blue beam out into the night sky on its left side and disappeared into the clouds. I cannot believe that my friend looked down at his phone just before it started to act like it was not a satellite but maybe other people saw it too.  Disneyland can be very crowded.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Bright Blue/White Orb Hovers Over Anaheim, CA;2020-06-24 19:09:00;8-10 minutes;Bright Blue/White Orb Hovers Over Anaheim, CA Around 7:00pm my husband and I were outside eating dinner on our back patio.  I looked up and saw a round shiny bright object in the sky.  We’ve been having issues with neighbors setting off illegal fireworks, for a quick moment I thought that’s what I was viewing until I realized it was more of a very bright stationary orb and much higher up than a firework, or even the planes in the area go.  I watched it for a couple of minutes and asked my husband to go inside and get his phone for me so that I could try and get video of it.  I recorded three small videos, the whole time the orb stayed in the same location until the last video, after recording the last one and then watching it on my husband’s phone I didn’t think I had footage of the object until we watched it on our computer around the 00:08 second mark you can see the object quickly fly off to the left of the screen, I was still recording afterwards because neither myself or my husband had seen the object fly off.  I apologize for the shaky hand, I was having a hard time trying to focus on the object and hold the phone still. If I had to compare the object I’d say it appeared to be as high up as Saturn or Jupiter have been appearing lately when they pass. It was in the East. I’m having a hard time guessing the altitude but it was much higher than any of the planes we have fly over in the area, no sound emitted from the object. There is some background noise in the video from our neighbors as well as some traffic noise, if the object did have any noise it would have been too far up for us to hear it. We did have an airplane flying much lower, we are near flight paths for LAX, Long Beach, and Santa Ana. There was also a police helicopter that flew by, but much lower and towards the West, it didn’t seem to be out to look at the object, we’ve had some crime in the area lately and it’s not uncommon for the helicopter to be out at all hours of the day. I’m curious to know if you think this is a UFO or maybe just something like a drone breaking FAA flight regulations.  I know that drones can reach very high altitudes even though they aren't supposed to.  However, I’ve never seen a drone that could take off as fast as this object appears to, or emit a light like that during the day.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
