Ball of multicolored light in sky;2012-11-08 23:00:00;15 minutes;ball of multicolored light in sky Thursday night 11:00 P.M. Anaheim, Ca looking south from Ball/Euclid my girlfriend and I looked up to see a flash of blue flickering light up in the sky.  It was a ball of light about 1000 feet up.  At first we thought lightning or a helicopter, but it pulsated dripping /molten colors of blue, then went to red, white, yellow, orange and purples.  It stopped flashing after approx 2 minutes.  When it stopped it went dark, although still kind of shimmering.  We could see the shape of this sphere like little flecks of 'fireflies' barely visible.  We looked around the sky and noticed about 10 other of these spheres lined up in a line right above it looking the same.  After about 4 minutes, this sphere rose up in the sky above all of these other spheres quickly but not very far (about 2 seconds).  Then another ball off to the right started flashing different colors of blue for about 30 seconds.  All of these spheres remained silent and in-formation.  We watched for about 15! minutes, nothing else was happening but these balls were still in the sky.  We left, they were still present. It's difficult to say how large or how far away they were, probably 1 to 2 miles away and larger than a hot air balloon.  I've never seen anything like this before,  I wish I had a video camera to record it.  Anyone looking up in the sky paying attention would have seen this!;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Helicopter chasing ball of light.;2014-03-12 19:30:00;2 minutes;Helicopter chasing ball of light. Anaheim, CA- Wed evening March 12, 2014 approx 7:30 pm, while sitting in the backyard looking south toward Katella Ave, I saw a bright-white star-like orb being followed or chased by a helicopter.  They both were travelling from west to east about 80 mph fast, straight and horizontal about 300 feet up.  They were travelling parallel to Katella Ave from about Beach Blvd. vicinity when I first noticed.   I ran and got my binoculars and watched as they passed in front of me.  The copter was close to it, maybe 75 feet behind and slightly above it about 30 degrees.  I could see the copter.  I could see the orb light, there was not a craft attached to it,  just a bright sphere of light.  The orb appeared to be no larger than the cockpit of the copter.   As they continued on fast, straight and horizontal, the orb faded out around Harbor Blvd vicinity.  The copter kept going.   5 minutes later 2 loud military type helicopters flew by along the same path.  There were many helicopters heard that night, but I did not see any more strange flying lights.  This orb was self-illuminated and looked like a flying ball of light, not like an aircraft with a fuselage of any sort.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Many silver spheres.;2014-12-30 12:14:00;3 minutes;Many silver spheres Around 50 silver spheres flying in circles and also forming shapes, seems they were protecting something.  We saw the spheres 50 meters about Walmart on Euclid Ave.  So many, that we got scared.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Drone-like sphere follows airplane in clear afternoon sky, then veers slowly away, before vanishing.;2017-06-09 17:29:00;1 minute;Drone-like sphere follows airplane in clear afternoon sky, then veers slowly away, before vanishing. At my apartment complex, I had just walked out to toss trash in a dumpster, when I heard, and then saw, a Cessna model 172 flying in an Easterly direction, above the trees and housing area nearby.  The sky was blue, and without any clouds.  The Cessna flew at an altitude that suggested it would land at nearby Fullerton airport.  It was perhaps about one quarter mile south of my location. Just a moment after looking at the Cessna airplane, I noticed a mostly round shaped object, about one third the length of the Cessna in size, was flying just slightly higher and behind the Cessna plane.  The object was colored mainly white and black, and had a single and very bright white light near its top that flashed regularly, like a beacon or strobe. The object flew on at a slower speed than the Cessna, and I followed it for about one minute as it flew farther away and farther South than the track the Cessna had taken.  When the object was then just a tiny point in the clear sky, it suddenly just vanished.  I watched for another minute or so, but it never came back. The best thing I can compare the object to would be the flying ‘drone balls’ that are in the Tom Cruise Science-Fiction film called “Oblivion”.  The object flew and looked much like those round drones in that movie, though I estimate it to have been much larger in size than those in the film were.  Maybe the size of a Smart Car or Fiat 500. I believe whatever this object was, that it was a remotely controlled vehicle.  Whether it was of an alien origin, or a secret military device, I can only speculate at this point.  But I can say that it is the second time I have seen a drone-like UFO flying in the vicinity of my apartment in Anaheim, seeing another one just last year, also in the afternoon daylight hours.   Lastly, I had the feeling it knew it was being observed.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Red light turns into a white light with smaller lights doing a dance before fading out.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-09 05:39:00;2 minutes;red light turns into a white light with smaller lights doing a dance before fading out. It was 5:39 in the morning.  I was on the 91 freeway headed westbound, when I saw what looked like a satellite entering the atmosphere going eastboud.  It has a red light with smaller red lights following behind it.  It looked like a fireball with a trail behind it at first.  It was there for maybe 10 seconds.   Then it came back maybe 20 seconds later and now it was white colored.  It broke off into smaller dimmer lights with the main light in the center.  These smaller lights broke away and did a dance and then faded out.  Then it came back again maybe a minute later as a red glowing light headed west bound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
