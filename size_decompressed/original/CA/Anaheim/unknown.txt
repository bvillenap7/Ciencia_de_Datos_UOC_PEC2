Looked like the sun glinting off metal We were leaving work when my wife said there is the Moon and I looked up and saw something that I tought was a very bright star at the 9 o`clock postion. I then step back and looked again and said to my wife what is that next to it? We then saw a flash like the Sun glinting off metal. It sat at the 9 o`clock position for like 3 mins then shot off towards the left of the Moon but staying about at 9 o`clock. We then decide to try and rush home and see if we see it through binoculars. As we were driving down the street we kept watching for it at stop signs and saw it shoot to the 12 o`clock position above the Moon. We waited and then saw it take off again towards the 9 o`clock position and then disappear. The whole time it was like the Sun was flashing of metal. and it was hovering when we first saw it for like 3 mins.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Silent, hovering, orange light at about 500 ft and about 1oo yds away.and disappeared in an instant.;2013-01-01 21:00:00;15 minutes;Silent, hovering, orange light at about 500 ft and about 1oo yds away.and disappeared in an instant. A yellow-orange light moved slowly from north to south and hovered just west of us as we watched the fireworks at Disneyland.  We were about three blocks west of Disneyland. There was no sound as it moved south.  The fireworks was very noisy.  As the show ended and as everyone reentered the house, I remained outside to observe the orange light.  It was about a football field west of me.  Silent and totally motionless. After about three minutes the light went out and it was gone. The color of the light, not ordinary aircraft lights and the absence of any sound I found interesting. It was not a helicopter but what else can hover that long without any sound?;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
A UFO with 3 alternating red, and 3 white, lights flashing, floated across sky then vanished.;2014-09-16 14:24:00;1 minute;A UFO with 3 alternating red, and 3 white, lights flashing, floated across sky then vanished. On 09/16/2014, at 14:24 local time, in Anaheim, California, I had gone out onto my 2nd floor apartment balcony.  Just after exiting the front entry door, I looked up to check for any wasp nests under the overhang from the roofline edge. At that moment, I immediately noticed an object hovering in the clear open sky, past the roof of the apartments, opposite my own.  The object shape was sort of fuzzy and hard to make out, but it was silent, and flashed 3 red lights, then 3 white lights.  The object looked close enough to have made a sound, if it had been a helicopter.   The object very slowly floated off to my right (in an Easterly direction), and got gradually farther away, but I could still clearly see the alternating lights flashing, red then white, red then white...    After about one minute of watching the object, a dragonfly insect flew close to where I stood on my balcony, and for a brief second distracted me from the object.  When I looked back at where the object should have been, there was no lights or sign of the ufo anymore - as if it had 'blinked off' or simply just vanished.   I watched the sky for half a minute more, but there was nothing at all to seen in the blue, above me.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603

I heard a loud noise which turned out to be a Helicopter (possibly a military helicopter) chasing 2 little red lights about 1,000 ft in the air or less one in front of the so fast that the helicopter seem to have a hard time following. the red lights were traveling at a very high speed (to me they seemed to be going to fast to be drones).  As they passed almost directly over our heads, one of the red lights sped up passing the other one and leaving the helicopter way behind.  They were traveling north through orange county towards Los Angeles.  I watched until they out of my sight.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
