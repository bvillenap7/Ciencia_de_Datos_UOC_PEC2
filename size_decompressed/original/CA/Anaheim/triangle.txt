I saw a triangular, see through object;2003-06-18 06:30:00;5 minutes;I saw a triangular, see through object As I was walking to school one morning with my two brothers and a friend, we notice 3 men gazing at the sky.  As we walked passed them, I heard one of them say It's a ufo. That was what got my attention.  As I looked at where they pointed, i saw in the sky some kind or triangular shaped object in the sky.  Or at least I think it was because it seemed crystalised or see-through.  I gazed at the object with disbilief until it disapeared in a blink of an eye.  Unlucky was that my brothers didn't see it, but I know the men did, wich later on just went inside their working factory.

Triangle shape U.F.O. flying by overhead;2009-01-31 22:00:00;10 Seconds;Triangle shape U.F.O. flying by overhead I was outside with some friends and cousins playing basketball, we stopped and were just standing around and talking. One of our friend starts talking something about Orion's belt and we were looking up. All of a sudden DIRECTLY above us we see these halo-like really dim white lights, it was three of them and they formed the shape of a triangle. It was about the height of helicopters flying around when there's news and chases and things of that nature. It made a weird hoovering? sound, its hard to explain really. We were all really surprised as it was flying relatively low. The skies were really clear and we only saw it for about 10 seconds just to where we were able to see it as the light were really dim and could not see it that far after it passed. This has been my very first sighting and I am very intrigued by what it could be. I did not manage to get any pictures of it as I did not have my cell on me and was very short in length, but there was 8 witnesses to this.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Triangular shape object with very faint, dimmed circles for gray light seen over Disneyland.;2009-04-25 22:45:00;12 seconds;Triangular shape object with very faint, dimmed circles for gray light seen over Disneyland. Witnessed a perfect sharp triangle shape flying object over Disneyland. We were waiting for the tram to take us to the parking lot when I've seen this flying object. I started shouting and pointed the object to my wife other people in line. No sound. 20-30% smaller than a 737 but similar speed to a 737 on approach to land 20 miles away from airport. The object had very faint, dimmed circles of gray light on both sides of the triangle towards the sharp angle. There were 5 circle on each side. The object was stealth like. I was able to see it at first because it blocked the light from a star and because it leveled its end with the front in its descend. Perfect weather conditions. The object moved from south-west to north-east.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Low flying, triangular shaped, series of dimly lit orange lights;2010-11-28 22:00:00;20 seconds;Low flying, triangular shaped, series of dimly lit orange lights Six (6) dimly lit, orange lights in the formation of a triangle made up the object. Three (3) lights making up the outer corners of the triangle were accompanied by three (3) more lights, making a smaller triangle in the middle of the first. (Refer to the corners of a triforce to better grasp this concept.) It appeared that all the lights were connected to the same craft, as opposed to the lights being their each individual entities, because as the object moved through the sky, the lights remained equidistant to each other. he rest of the craft, aside from the lights, was a dense dark shade of black. The only way it was possible to make out the shape of the craft, was seeing how it blocked out the stars as it passed through the sky. Besides that, the craft was relatively invisible in contrast with the black sky. It flew through the area quite low, such as if you were in the proximity of an airport with the planes flying over you to land. The biggest shock of all, when comparing this object to a low flying aircraft, was the absolute absence of any and all noise. No engine noise, no sonic boom. The craft moved in pure silence. The object passed through the sky heading heading Westbound. We first saw the object in the horizon of the Eastern sky, towards Yorba Linda.  We watched it come straight towards us, and just as it had nearly reached our location, it began to alter it's course. It bent to it's ride side and headed North-West towards Fullerton.  The time it took for it to get from the Eastern horizon, across the sky, and out of sight to the North-West was about 20 seconds.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
three lighted triangular object;2010-12-26 22:54:00;5 seconds;three lighted triangular object there appeared to be a triangular object with 3 orangish/white lights at each of the angles that flew across the sky in a northeasterly direction and was gone within 5 seconds.   The object made a very low humming noise and was at the lower cloud covering (approx 10 K feet).;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
We were fishing in Anaheim, CA, on July 23, 2011, when we saw a large triangle UFO fly overhead;2011-07-23 23:06:00;30-45 seconds;We were fishing in Anaheim, CA on July 23, 2011 when we saw a large triangle UFO fly overhead While we were fishing as a local private lake my husband notices an odd dimly light triangle shape object coming out direction traveling in a south/west direction. He turned to me and told me to look at it to make sure he was really seeing what we both believe to be a UFO. It was traveling at a steady pace at about 70-80 miles per hour at about 1/4 to 1/2 mile up. It was very clearly a triangle shape and had very define points to it. We were both very baffled as to how something that shape could be flying in the night sky. The sky was free from and clouds and it was very clear out. As it passed by it blocked the view of the stars so we knew we were looking as a solid object. It was a very surreal feeling to be looking at this object. It kind of scared me a bit as well. Being a very logical person I was going through things it might be in my head as I was analyzing it as it flew over. There was nothing that I could logically say it resembled that I have ever ! seen and I have seen many tv programs in military aircrafts and prototypes and this looked nothing like anything I have ever seen in my life. I would say the size would be in proportion with a 747 jet. It had 3 very dim square light at each triangle point. The lights were a white glow similar to a florescent bulb and they were casting a glow in between each light showing the triangle shape. As it flew over we noticed that there was no sound what so ever and as it passed us we could see the back of it as it glided over us. It was perfectly flying it a straight line and parallel to the sky. It never pivoted of veered off course. After it passed by we got a very good view of the back of the craft. It was a flat dark surface about 15 to 20 ft high. We continued to watch it until it was out of sight. I have to say that was a very eerie feeling and I will never forget what I saw that night.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
