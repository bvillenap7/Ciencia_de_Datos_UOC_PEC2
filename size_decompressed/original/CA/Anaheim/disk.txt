silent oval ufo;2002-02-18 22:15:00;1 minute;silent oval ufo I was walking out to my car after work late in the evening. I was looking up at the stars, and i noticed a medium sized craft move accross the sky above me (about 60 to 70 ft.) luminated by the lights in the parking lot, I could only make out the bottum of the craft. Oval in shape, off grey, it made no sound and it flew. I watched this untill it flew into darkness. Really odd, forst thought was that it was a ballon, but it just didnt move like one, and it was much to big. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Spinning top shaped craft photographed in california November 2008;2008-11-14 20:30:00;Five minutes;Spinning top shaped craft photographed in california November 2008 I was a British tourist photographing a night scene in Anaheim CA from a hotel balcony on convention way, I was trying to photograph 777 convention way the Hilton hotel main tower block.  As a amateur I took several photographs at different settings and on my return home I saved the best looking pictures to hard drive.  That was 2008.  I reviewed the picture earlier this year and found that the camera had captured a spinning top shape craft to the right of the main tower in two consecutive shots I have researched light aberration and photographic anomalies and found nothing to explain the pictures as having an ordinary known fault.   All I can conclude is something was in the sky that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Flying disk over Anaheim Ca;2009-01-16 20:30:00;1 min;Flying disk over Anaheim Ca I was walking out of a music venue in Anaheim by the I-5 with a friend, we were walking though the parking lot talking as I looked up I saw a round disk flying over our heads going East by North East. She looked up and saw it as well, the disk had lights on the edge and was spinning. It was about as high as a small plane would fly but made no noise;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Flying Saucer Seen Cruising Over I-5 Near Anaheim Late at Night;2010-03-10 00:45:00;5 seconds;Flying Saucer Seen Cruising Over I-5 Near Anaheim Late at Night A low-flying aircraft of a round, saucer-like shape was seen flying north alongside the I-5 south in Anaheim after midnight on Tuesday night as I was driving home to San Diego from Los Angeles. My peripheral vision picked up a low-flying airplane above the freeway, which caught my interest. As I looked to examine it, I noticed it was not an airplane but a darkly-colored (black or dark grey) saucer-shaped object that was moving at what seemed to be a low speed and at what seemed to be a low altitude. It was difficult to tell, as my car was moving past it at 70 mph in the opposite direction, but the craft appeared to be travelling somewhere between 40-70 mph, going north, and only a few hundred feet off the ground.  This would have made the object itself a bit smaller than an airplane, although it is too difficult to estimate a size. What was then even more interesting was a blue light that emitted from the side wall of the craft, moving in a circle around the ! craft, looking a bit like a reflection from a glass wall, but perhaps coming from within the craft. It was then that I really thought I'd seen a U.F.O. I had never seen one before, and I still have my doubts about this one.  The craft was spotted in a densely populated urban area, not far from Disneyland and many other world-famous entertainment spectacles, and it may simply have been coming from or going to one of those places.  But for the five seconds I had to witness it, the craft truly did not look human to me. Many more people saw the object I'm sure, and so I made this report to see if anyone else who saw it also was taken aback by its curiosities.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
UFO over Anaheim CA, near midnight, circular with blue lights. Investigated by mysterous helicopter.;2010-10-10 23:30:00;30;UFO over Anaheim CA, near midnight, circular with blue lights. Investigated by mysterous helicopter. About 23:45 hours on above date I recieved a call from a family member.  The family member was hysterical about a supposed UFO near our location.  This family member indicated that there was a UFO hovering over a major hotel in the area, that dozens of people had pulled over to watch it and that it showed no sign of leaving.  Myself and two other family members quickly got into a vehicle and drove to the location they were at.  While we were in transit, we saw a strange helicopter approach the area and alternatingly hover and search. This helicopter had the apparent length of a CH-47 military helicopter, but was unidentifiable due to lack of lighting.  It had none of the regular blinking red lights, but had alternatingly green, orange, and blue bright lights flashing in a regular pattern.  It appeared to have some sort of attached storage device under it, cube or rectangular shaped. The light configuration and storage construct was unlike anything I had seen before.  The altitude of the helicopter was about 75 meters.  The helicopter was there from about the time I recieved the call (possibly earlier) and bugged out at approx. 0010 hours in a N/NW direction. We approached the location my family member gave me and parked alongside 9 other vehicles, each with 2-5 people in them all looking in the same direction.  We personally were unable to see the UFO as it left minutes before we arrived.  We stayed for about 45 minutes and it did not reappear. The family member that called me took video on her cellphone and upon getting home, we loooked online and there was already one other video of the event posted. On a perhaps unrelated note, a cell phone in the house at 2232 hours experienced service interruption and emitted an electronic tone I have never heard before.  The tone sounded like the hybrid tone of a dial up phone, but without the tempo or form associated with that normal tone. The cell phone video my family member took is available if needed.

UFO seen flying over Disneyland during fireworks show.;2011-06-16 21:00:00;3 minutes;UFO seen flying over Disneyland during fireworks show. I was visiting California for my little sister's graduation. My family and I went to Disneyland after her graduation.  The UFO was seen in the evening at Sleeping Beauty's Castle during the end of the night fireworks show.  During the middle of the fireworks show, my family and I, along with the hundreds of people at Disney, noticed a shape approaching the castle coming from the West.  The shape became evident that it was in the shape of a saucer as it flew closer to the castle.  Hundreds of eye witnesses and myself became very quiet as it flew over us.  My best guess is it was maybe 500 ft above us as we could all see it was silver, metallic and it had a series of lights on the underside of the craft that spiraled in a counter-clockwise direction.  The craft never made a sound as it flew over us.  The flight pattern was smooth and linear.  The craft never stopped.  It continued to fly through the fireworks, over the castle and onto the horizon. I tried to video tape! it with my little digital camera however, all you could see was the lights swirling in the counter-clockwise direction and could not quite make out the shape of the craft because it was too dark.  I remember listening to a bunch of the surrounding people whispering and asking if that was a UFO as it approached the castle.  There is no doubt in my mind that what we saw was not an airplane, helicopter or any other flying craft we typically see in the sky.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603

I was in my bedroom opening the window to let fresh air come inside the room, suddenly i noticed the presence of the big object outside my window.  The size a little more bigger than a car.   Didn't do any noise and was like trying to hide in the palms.  But in the day i have seen it also white and dark objects.  The object moves slow and disappears in seconds. I don't used to believe in this things and i have now nightmares, I talk to my neighbor and show her the same night about the strange lights in the sky and absolute this things are not regular planes. I will like to please the authorities to come around 10:30pm or 11:00pm at night to verify this objects that are flying so close of the houses and apartments.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
