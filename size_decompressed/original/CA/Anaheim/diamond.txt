Large fiery orange object seemed to come apart then turned and climbed in altitude and speed.;2009-10-30 22:20:00;12 minutes;Large fiery orange object seemed to come apart then turned and climbed in altitude and speed. On Friday, October 30th at around 10:20PM I was on my balcony smoking a cigarette when I noticed a very large light moving from the North-West to the South-East. What got my attention is that the light was larger than the normal flight traffic you get here between LAX and John Wayne airports. It was a deep orange color, no wing tip lights or other normal blinking marker lights. I watched for more than 5 minutes as it approached my location growing bigger, before I called to my son. My 19yo son commented that this was very definitely not our normal passenger air traffic, and that is very unsettling.  A few moments later the light made a turn to our left and headed do west out over the Pacific Ocean and gained altitude. Just at this moment it seemed to break apart or drip debris. Looked very much like burning embers falling from the object and fading as the fell. Both my son and I felt that this must have been a burning aircraft up until it turned and gained altitude as it headed out to sea.  We see a tremendous amount of air traffic (civilian and military) here as well as occasional launches from Vandenberg AFB. This was very definitely not either! Too big to be aircraft and missile launches generally produce a very white light. Waited to report until today as we assumed we would hear about it in the news today.  Last night was an almost full moon and exceedingly clear cloudless night. The altitudes and speeds  seemed consistent with general aviation, although the size and orange color were inconsistent as well as the turn towards the pacific and the debris falling. Total viewing time 10-12 minutes.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603

I noticed a group of triangular craft flying in sequence and then they disappeared within 10 seconds. They were white in color.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
