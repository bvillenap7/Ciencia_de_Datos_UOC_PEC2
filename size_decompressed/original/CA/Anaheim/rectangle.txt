brown rectangular object, appeared very high, no movement or sound;1999-08-23 16:00:00;5 minutes;brown rectangular object, appeared very high, no movement or sound My wife and I were walking to our car. I heard an airplane above so I looked up.  When I looked up, I saw the airplane, but I also saw the object.  The object was stationary.  The airplane moved underneath the object, but you could tell that the object was very much higher than the airplane (the plane was at least at 15,000 feet), possibly by many thousands of feet.  After the airplane passed, I kept looking at the object, trying to figure out what it was.  It looked like one of those rectangular parachutes, that sort of shape.  It was brown in color.  It made no movements at all and no noise that I could tell.  I told my wife to look up and I had to point it out to her because it was so high up that it was very small and I had to have her look off the point of my finger to see it.  She did see it and she could not make out anything more that what I saw.  We watched it for about 5 minutes or so and it never moved.  I told my wife that it must be a geostationary sattelite in orbit and we went on with our business.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
