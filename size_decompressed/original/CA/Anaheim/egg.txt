Egg-shaped object hovering 3 feet off ground.  Dark blue with rose/pink pulsaing interior light.;2014-09-13 23:15:00;2 minutes;egg shaped object hovering 3 feet off ground.  Dark blue with rose/pink pulsaing interior light. On Saturday September 13, 2014, at 11:15 PM on the 1500 block of West Embassy Street in Anaheim California 92802 (the cross street is Loara 1 block south of Lincoln Avenue).   I observed the following:  In the middle of the street (Embassy Avenue) I saw an egg shaped object floating 2-3 feet off the ground.  The object was about 2 ½ feet across and it was approximately 20 feet away from me.  It was a dark blue like an India ink blue and it blended into the night and the black asphalt.  The only illumination was from a street light.  I first thought it might have been a helium balloon that had drifted from Disneyland.  Disneyland is about 2 miles away and sometimes helium balloons float away and they land in the area.  Upon close inspection it had no string attached to it and it stayed in the same position.  It never touched the ground. As I approached the object I could see that the “balloon” had a thin semi-transparent membrane covering it.  Inside the object I could see a faint rose/pink colored light that was the size of a football and the light slowly pulsated.  It was a faint light.  Not bright.  And it was inside the object.  The object was smooth and it looked like latex.  Not metallic.  It had no antenna, fins nor propeller.  And it had no exterior lights. As I walked towards the object it remained in place about 3 feet off the ground.  My first impression was that it may be a balloon, drone or remote controlled object.  But it made no sound.  The object was totally silent.  It seemed peaceful and tranquil.  Not threatening. As I walked toward it (I did not run or make any fast moves), I thought I would try to capture it but when I got within about 2 feet from the object it slowly rose out of my reach straight up into the night sky.  It banked to the north and went over the buildings across the street and out of sight.  Its motion was smooth and not fast.  I never touched it. I did not experience any adverse reaction from it.  In fact it seemed inviting and almost playful.  I regret I did not have a camera with me to photograph it.   I was alone and no one else to my knowledge saw the object.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Low flying/hovering egg shaped object seen in southern california w/video.;2019-10-24 18:45:00;20-30 seconds;Low flying/hovering egg shaped object seen in southern california w/video. Good evening around 1845 on Thursday Oct 24 2019 my wife and I were driving Northbound toward Los Angeles on the 405. As we were passing through the town of Anaheim we noticed a unusual egg/oval shaped object that appeared to be floating then suddenly moving downward and upward erratically. I quickly pulled out my phone to try and capture what we were both witnessing. What we were seeing was approximately 100 yards off the highway and seemed to be above a parking garage by the looks of it. The color of the craft was grey in color with some shimmery texture to it. It appeared to be maybe 10-15 feet in height but was hard to tell as we were driving and it was moving frantically. I looked online on multiple sights and asked on multiple social media sites to see if anyone else that was around witnessed the same thing. I was able to get a decent 20-25 second video of the craft which I will attach. The first thing I thought of when I saw this was that it’s a big balloon that usually car dealers put on the cars if they are having a big sale of some sort. But after getting closer and than witnessing the object quickly come down then go back up I realized it couldn’t be a balloon cause they do not move that erratic or suddenly. Also there was no strings or anything attached to this thing. What I could tell this object was approximately 75-100 feet in the air. A little background on myself, I have noticed unusual objects flying since moving out here in California 4 years ago.  I’m 28 years old and am a Marine Corps OEF combat veteran.  Served just over 5 years before coming out here.  After that I worked for the government as a contractor and was around aviation heavily so I have a strong deep understanding and knowledge of aviation and in general flying.  This sighting was for sure a bit off and it wasn't anything iv seen nor know of that would be able to maneuver the way this thing did. Hope this was detailed enough and I was able to shed some light on the issue.  Stay vigilant.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
