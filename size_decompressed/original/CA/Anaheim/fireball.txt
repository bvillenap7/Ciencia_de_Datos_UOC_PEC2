Yellow glowing object that shone like a star but distinct from either stars , human craft, meteor;2012-02-14 00:00:00;5 minutes;Yellow glowing object that shone like a star but distinct from either stars , human craft, meteor I witnessed an yellow glowing object which ejected a red object as it gradually dissappeared into space.  It appered to be a large bright yellow object which caused some kind of electrical interferance with my tv signal of which i only became aware of its cause by walking outside and looking skyward and observing this glowing object on the evening of feb 14 2012 around 7 to 7:20 pm.   I am sure it was neither a star or human craft but perhaps some unknown object yet to be if ever determined;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603

Moments later I saw a red orange sphere floating over the free way from the direction where the meteor would have fallen.  I was driving southbound, the object was floating northbound, pretty quickly, and then I lost sight of it. I saw it for maybe 10 seconds.  I thought chinese lantern but, this thing was floating or flying pretty quick. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Manuevering Fireballs in the Sky in Souther California;2014-05-04 23:10:00;3 minutes;Manuevering Fireballs in the Sky in Souther California We were in the car coming to a stop light when we looked up and 3 round almost looked like fireballs or pieces of burning debris moving smooth and calm through the sky.  I got my phone out and recorded about a minute of it.  We pulled away passing them and a fourth one appeared behind by itself.  They were weird looking and other people in cars next to us were also looking and taking pictures.  I thought that they were Chinese lanterns maybe, but these things were flying pretty low and they were not Chinese lanterns.  I only say that because of the pulsating and they way they were flying the same direction sometimes even lining up.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603

My friend pointed something out, it was so weird because it happened so fast.  I saw something spin and by the second spin, the lights disappeared.   I was in total shock, never in my life have I seen anything close to looking like this.  It scared the hell out of my friend, too.

Strange fireball in morning sky over Anaheim.;2015-11-13 05:45:00;>1 minute;Strange fireball in morning sky over Anaheim 11/13/15  Looking out at what I believe we're Venus and Jupiter in the sky at approx 6am (perhaps 5:30) PST.   Was looking out of a hotel room towards Disneyland resort area and it was early dawn.  In the sky appeared a light that at first could have been a meteor but moved slowly in its trajectory and made a very long streak.  It became a little brighter and then faded out to nothing, similar to when a plane flies, turns towards you, and then turns away.   I do not know what I saw, but it seemed far too slow moving for a shooting star/meteor.   It also was the date that debris was reported to be crashing to earth, but I did not read anywhere that this would have been visible over Anaheim, California.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
UFO on fire.;2016-07-17 22:00:00;30 seconds;Sitting on my porch facing south, I look up into the sky and what I saw, was a UFO on fire.  If it was a plane on fire, it would have been on the news.   It was flying as fast as a plane or helicopter.   I kept my eye on it as it traveled north, until it was out of my eyesight.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Red orb spotted in daytime in Anaheim.;2017-04-17 10:10:00;10 seconds;Red orb spotted in daytime in Anaheim. Stopped at a light on Westminster Blvd. looking toward Anaheim, I noticed a red orb in the clouds.  I blinked a few times to verify if it was flashing from, perhaps a plane, but it remained solid red.   It kept moving downward smoothly.  After a good seven seconds, I tried to grab my phone real quick to get a video but as I looked up, it disappeared.  It looked as if it left a small visible trail behind it.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Fireball good across the sky leaving a trail.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-06 20:58:00;2 seconds;Fireball good across the sky leaving a trail. While at Disneyland a fireball came into view.  The object changed color before disappearing.   It could not be a shooting star because it was very bright and unlike any other shooting stars I've seen.   We have taken annual trips to see shooting stars in August where there is no light pollution, and the magnitude of the objects brightness was unlike anything I've seen.

On 91 freeway, we saw this orange ball of fire then it moved and it left a tail of fire.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-09 05:30:00;1;Driving down the 91 freeway, we saw this orange ball of fire, then it moved and it left a tail of fire (Iâ€™m calling fire because it was redish/orange like fire).   Then the light disappeared off the sky and came back on, but this time it was normal white lights and it seemed like a round shape object with three round lights on the bottom.   The object then expanded/threw sort of like throwing nets in the sky and were lid up and then it retracted them.  After that, the lights went off and disappeared of the sky.

At 00:19 I saw first what looked liked sparks coming off of a white dot that lasted about a second, then there was a flash of light, like lightening but it didn't illuminate the whole sky, just a flash of a ball of white light around the object quite larger than the small streak of sparks and then the most unsettling part, it looked like there was a tear in the sky that then closed like a zipper being zipped up this object disappeared into.  There are no stars out tonight and very little clouds so this sighting was very clear and had to be witnessed by others in the area by anyone outside at the time.  I'm compelled to report this when I haven't reported other strange sightings in the night sky because it was so much to see and I think other reports of this will come in and corroborate the event.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
