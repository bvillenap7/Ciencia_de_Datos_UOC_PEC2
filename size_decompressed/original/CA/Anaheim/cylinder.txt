Cylindrical shaped very fast hovering craft..1972 siting;1972-03-20 17:30:00;20-30 seconds;Cylindrical shaped very fast hovering craft..1972 siting On my way across the street to go babysitting at approx. 5:30 p.m. / dusk, I heard a loud buzzing tone...similar to the electrical transformers on a foggy morning.  I looked up and saw a cylindrical shaped object with rotating lights hovering over me at about the heighth of the telephone poles.  I stood in the middle of the street for about 20 seconds just watching it and it took a deep dip and sped away in 1/2 second. I continued on to my babysitting job, and while there got very ill and threw-up a couple of times.  I decided no one would believe me then, so I never told anyone until now.  I also lived very close to the Los Alamitos Air Base at the time and I decided there was some experimental stuff going on...obviously to justify what I saw.  I have since talked with many engineers who have informed me that we did not have and still do not have the technology that I describe here. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was on my way home from my job when the car just stoped and so did the one's behind me. Some of the people behind my got out and asked me if I know what was going on, I said I have no idea, now the funny thing is I the car was new so I kinda mad, I heard this humming sound so I look around and found and when I could'nt find anything I looked up and I saw 2 cylinder shapes just siting there above us and they landed, then whent back up in the air and vanished. Then my car and the one's behind me startd up.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
