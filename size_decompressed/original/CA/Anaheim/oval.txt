Myself & roomate were standing out by my truck in the street and noticed an unusual flying object that was moving slowly sort of hovering, then suddenly shot off to the right in aprox 25 degree angle, faster then seemed possible and unlike any jets we had ever seen. Blip, & then it was gone. This was in the late afternoon, still light outside, this was not a light beam or anything projected, we could see that it was a flying object, with flashing lights like a plane but flying unlike any plane I had ever seen.  When it suddenly shot off, it was much too fast and in a way that seemed imossible for any jet I've ever seen.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603

My wife and I saw what by all appearances was a UFO at Disneyland on the night of June 4th 2015.;2015-06-04 22:45:00;5-6 minutes;My wife and I saw what by all appearances was a UFO at Disneyland on the night of June 4th 2015. My wife and I were at Disneyland on the night of June 4th 2015.  We were sitting on a low railing around a planter, waiting for the 11:00 pm light parade to start.  It was approximately 10:45 pm.  We were directly in front of the Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln building, facing west toward the circle that is the beginning of Main Street.  A man sitting to my right on the same railing got my attention by saying to me (while he was looking to the sky directly above the circle), Are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing, or am I going crazy?   I followed his line of sight and observed what I at first glance appeared to be a giant dark smoke ring at cloud level (approximately 2000 feet).  I answered him, and said, No, you're not crazy I see it.   I then said, What is that?  He then said (as neither one of us took our eyes off of the object), I don't know, that's what I'm trying to figure out.  At that time, my wife (sitting to my left on the same railing ) said to me what are you looking at, looked in the same direction and observed the same thing, she then asked me what it was. I told her I did not know.  Clearly this was not a smoke ring of any kind because by this time (by which a couple of minutes had passed), if it had been a smoke ring, it would have dissipated.   Upon further observation, this was an object partially obscured by being at just the bottom level of the cloud layer.  As if it were using the clouds to camouflage itself.  This object appeared to have a slight oval shape.  And I would approximate it to be (at being 2000 feet above us) about 300 yards long and 250 yards wide.  As we watched it began very slowly move due north (towards Cinderella's castle ).  I would estimate its speed at no more the 30 mph.  The object traveled a distance equivalent of about six times its length and slowly disappeared upwards at that point, the clouds around it envelopeing it until it was out of sight.   I remember as the object moved slowly through the clouds you could see the clouds billowing around the leading edge of the object.  It emitted no sound that I could detect and hid so well in the clouds that you could only see its dark silhouette, the front of the object having a darker appearance than the rest of the  silhouette, giving it an almost transparent appearance.  At about the same time the object started moving, my wife and I stood up and walked five feet forward to the curb of the street to get a better look at the object, and we remained there till it was gone from sight.  I did not get the other man's phone number as I should have, but after I acknowledged that I did see the object he showed no interest in talking about what we had seen, and when the parade was over, he walked away into the crowd of people.  So unless someone else happened to see this and comes forward with what they saw, it's just the corroboration of my wife and me, and we will not deny what we saw.   I did take photos of the object that are difficult to make out because you are looking at an object obscured by clouds at night.  Although in one of the shots you can make out the leading and trailing edges of the craft.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
