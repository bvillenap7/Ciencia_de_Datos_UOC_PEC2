As I was sitting passenger, I noticed something that looked as it were flying, across the sky.but what caught my eye was that it looked as if it had a magnetic field in the front of it.  It was crescent shaped as it got closer, a white light was noticed rite behind the magnetic field.  We pulled to the side of the road . We exited car, and proceeded to stare at it, as it flew over , and soon passed us.  As it got further away, the light began to dim.  And rite before our eyes the object, flickered and went completely out. We got back into vehicle, and  continued on our way. ((NUFORC Note:  Atlas V missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 19:19 hrs.
