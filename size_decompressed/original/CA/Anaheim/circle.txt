dim light mocing oddly;2001-11-28 18:00:00;20 sec;dim light mocing oddly I dont remember the exact date. I was working outdoors at the Disneyland Hotel, it was a slow night and i was just staring out over the sky line when a dim starlike objet in the distance (south/west). I first thought it was just an aircraft (since there are quite afew that fly in that area). What caught my attention tho was that it wasnt moving, then shot up and stoped, stayed motionless for a few seconds and then moved slowly up out of veiw into the clouds.

Smoke ring in sky, anaheim, ca 1/04/2008;2008-01-03 15:28:00;constant;Smoke ring in sky, anaheim, ca 1/04/2008 Driving southbound on the 5 freeway looking SW out of my passenger's side window of my vehicle I saw a circular, black, smoke ring in the sky.  The smoke ring was constant and not moving.  It was a partly cloudy day, no rain and no wind.  The object was just North of Angels Stadium.  I tried to take a picture with my camera phone, but the smoke ring wasn't in the photo, just a bright light.  I never saw the object change appearance, but I had to keep driving and lost sight of the object.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Glowing Globe of Light;2009-02-18 21:32:00;15 minutes;Glowing Globe of Light i was going to my bed when i looked out the window and seen a large glowing globe out my window. at first it caught my eye as maybe an airplane as i do live near a military base. but the object lingered and it the glowing would get larger then it would go smaller then larger again.  i grabbed my camera and popped the screen out of my window to try to take some pictures. the object was present for around 15 minutes. i went thru my parents room to the balcony to get better pictures. i woke my dad up and told him he needed to see this object.  my dad thought it was just a helicopter and i told him no this doesnt look like any helicopter i have ever seen. he came outside and looked and he thought it looked kind of odd as well.  i showed the pictures i took to my husband who is in the military thru the computer and he had no idea what they were of and said i should do some research to find out what i was looking at.  please note the time on my camera is 1 hour ahead as i do not know how to change the time.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603

It was an odd orange color which caught my attention so I told my wife to look up.  She saw it too and shortly afterward about 1 minute of watching it around 5 smaller orange balls dropped from the sphere/UFO.  It was crazy...  It dropped these balls in a perfect straight line.  The sphere continued to move north east and appeared to pulse and finally disappeared.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Strange bright light on the sky that left a green trail that later disappeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;25 seconds;Strange bright light on the sky that left a green trail that later disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD)) I was sitting on a couch outside my house when a suddenly saw a bright light appear.  I was surprised by the brightness of the light I noticed that it was not a helicopter nor a plane.  As the light slowly cruised on the sky moving from left to right, the light diminished slowly and the light turned off but could still see the circular ufo. The light kept ongoing and the distance I saw the light that was once shining to the right was shining down.  Another thing that really surprised me was that it left a green trail that later disappeared, it kind of looked like an aurora but in Southern California??  This is the weirdest situation I've ever experienced in my life and hope I'm not the only one who saw this.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
4 small white circular objects flying around in random patterns in the Southern California Sky.;2017-04-06 11:55:00;5 minutes;4 Small White Circular objects flying around in random patterns in the Southern California Sky. I was on my way to my car with a co-worker, when I noticed 4 small white objects in the sky.  I took my sunglasses off and could not see them without my sunglasses on and actually handed my sunglasses to my co-worker so he could see them.  Once he saw them, we watched them circle each other and move around the sky randomly, almost as if they were playing with one another.  I noticed that a helicopter was flying nearby and these objects were much higher in the sky than an helicopter.   As we watched, we noticed that at one point all of them turned and the sun hit the objects creating 4 bright small circular objects in the sky.  We continued to watch them for about 4-5 minutes until they flew off into the distance away from the Orange County airport heading south about 20 miles inland from the coast.  The way these objects were flying, was almost as if they were birds playing in the sky, darting in and out and up and down and circling one another... not at all h! ow  commercial planes or helicopters would fly.  All 4 objects were the same size, they were white and when the sun hit them as they moved it shined a large glare off the objects.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603

I was on the phone with my husband, and I looked up to see about six spheres flying in a clump, they were on different levels.  Moving swiftly, some would move up and others down.  Heading South.  Some would go ahead and some would go backward the other direction just as fast as going forward.  Some would disappear and reappear.  As I tried to get my phone to record it, I lost sight of them.  A couple seconds later they reappeared in a line going west and then they disappeared.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
Red Orange Ball of Light;2019-12-10 18:23:00;5 minutes;Red orange ball of light in sky. Didnâ€™t have lights flashing every so often as a plan or helicopter does. No sound. Moved slowly. Dimmed lightly very few times. But no pattern when it would it happen. We saw it for about five minutes until we had to leave. So not sure how long exactly it was visible. Moved very, very slowly throughout the sky. At times, appearing to not move at all.;33.8344239820838;-117.878960545603
