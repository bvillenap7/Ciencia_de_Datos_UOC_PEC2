While watching TV, my wife noted what appeared to be a very bright star, we know our sky well on the ranch and hadn’t seen this before. We went outside and took our binoculars, what we saw was rotating lights, Ruby Red, Green and Yellow. It wasn’t distortion as they were sequential. We watched this object for at least  20 minutes. At that time, the lights became brighter, more intense and then it suddenly disappeared, it didn’t fly off, it was just gone. I had seen this exact same object in 1997 on the Alaska Hwy, when a missile shipment was going to Alaska, The drivers in the convoy had also mentioned seeing it when they returned.;41.4489;-123.0089
