Around 6:00 PM (PST) sitting in my bed and looking out the window over the city, I noticed a non blinking red light to the right of the city, it looked to me to be about to three or four miles away and at eye level, moving slower than an airplane from right to left.  As I continued watching the non blinking red light come directly in front of me, now about 1 mile away from my view and below eye level, I could tell that this object was a saucer shaped vehicle with a small dome above it and very bright red light on top.  I continued watching the saucer shaped vehicle fly over the city of Whittier until I could no longer see it.  Total viewing time about seven minutes.

When my mom came home I tried to tell her what I saw, but she told me not to bother her because she had to cook dinner.  after dinner by mom told me to do my homework, wash up and go to bed.  I could not tell my father what I had seen, because he did not come home until I was fast to sleep.  The next morning at the breakfast table, while my mother, father and brother were sitting down and the radio playing music, I told them what I had seen yesterday.  All my mother and father did was looking at each other and then looked back at me.  Two minutes later while I was he my breakfast the radio announcer reported that there was a UFO that flew over the city and that there were over a thousand witnesses that called in to report the UFO.  After the radio announcer finished the news flash, my mother and father look at each other and then looked back at me.  They did not ask me any questions or talk to me about the incident ever.  Weeks after the incident I started having what was commonly called ESP, because my mother always watched game shows, I most of the time said out loud what the number was.  My mom even new I had the ability for numbers, because several times she would ask me to go with her to the race track and pick some h! orses, b ut I always refused.;33.9759050909083;-118.030715927274
round saucer with bright lights circiling around it;2010-01-15 19:30:00;20 seconds;round saucer with bright lights circiling around it My wife and I were loading our kids into her car. She pointed to the sky and stated to me what's that. I looked up and saw a round craft with white lights going around the craft in a circular motion. The disk was flying low and emitted no noise. the object had a continous small red light on top of it. The object was moving slow and i lost it in the trees. My wife sketched what she saw the next morning and what she sketched was a picture of saucer which you see in the movies. We were very confused and mesmerized by this event. Never seen such a thing.;33.9759050909083;-118.030715927274
