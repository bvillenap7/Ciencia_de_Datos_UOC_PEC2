object returns to whittier;2006-03-11 11:00:00;fifteen min;object returns to whittier I stepped out of my apartment to have smoke and my room mate came also,as we lit up Ilooked up in to partly clouded sky and there it was near the same place it was seen two nights ago,except this time it was in bright day light.  It looked round and grey and it houvered, my room mate said that it's probably a toy balloon and went in to the apartment,  I then called one of my neighbors on my cell phone to come and see. Then the object went from north west into a full u-turn and headed south untill it went behind a huge white cloud ,by then my neighbor came out to see but it was gone.;33.9759050909083;-118.030715927274
