Three UFO's cat fight then fly off;2002-08-03 22:00:00;1 minute;Three UFO's cat fight then fly off my father was rambling one day about something he told me before late about 10pm and i would gaze at the stars alot cause i was told an uncle of mine used to do this all the time, i thought i was seeing a satalite slowly moving cause i sometimes watch them but then another light looking like a star or satalite moved to it then another came out and it was 3 star looking things slowly moving and sometimes shooting at but around eachother like a cat fight, i mean it was sometimes like that kitten letting its play partner see it is getting ready to creep it like a play attack then launches at him they roll a bit and separate and pause, after a few times of doing that they separated and shot out different directions and disapeared. It was so casual and fast I didnt even bring it up to my rambling father, couldnt anyway he wouldnt let you lol, anyway it was moving like nothing in the air anyone has ever seen, a catfight of UFO's who knows. I just remembered I have takin a picture of the sky one day when I was on the freeway in the back seat of a car and there was nothing there I was testing the camera with moving objects and in the air it looks like a Disc shaped UFO but I didnt see it the camera did I really dont know I guess I should send in the pic....;33.9759050909083;-118.030715927274

Judging from our observations it has to be pretty big and relativly close to be seen next to a almost full moon. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Mars.  PD));33.9759050909083;-118.030715927274
