V-shaped formation of pale amber lights;2001-09-26 05:23:00;Few seconds;V-shaped formation of pale amber lights I was looking up at the clear, lightening sky, enjoying the view when a formation of amber-colored lights flew by overhead. I know it was not a single triangular craft, since they did not blot out the background stars. The formation was an almost perfect V, two of the lights were slightly out of line with the rest. They did not make a sound, nor did they seem to affect my visibility of the stars they passed. The lights were pale and steady and did not blink or change color. It's hard to guesstimate the altitude, but I'll say perhaps 25,000 feet. They moved fast, the formation entered my vision near Monoceros, went through outer Orion and faded out of sight. Aircraft schedules have become a bit strange since the WTC incident. We are in the LAX flight path here. Of course I understand these may have just been fighter jets heading for March or El Toro/San Diego.;33.9759050909083;-118.030715927274

I took out my phone to take a picture which is when I noticed 2 black formations by the trail. They were too far up to tell what they were with the naked eye and when you zoom in on the photo it blurs a little, but the 2 formations are clearly there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness has forwarded a photograph, but the only potentially anomalous objects are two, blurry specks in the sky.  We do not know what they were.  PD));33.9759050909083;-118.030715927274
