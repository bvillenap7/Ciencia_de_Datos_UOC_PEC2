I am a 21 year old college student.  At about 10:55 pm pacific time, I was standing on my front porch smoking a cigarette, when I noticed a bright yellow light in the sky to the north west.  It stayed there for about 65-70 seconds.  It then started to move to the east in a very strange pattern. First, it moved perfectly vertical, then perfectly horizontal, and then vertical, and so on, until it moved a great deal across the sky.  While this light was flying in this strange pattern, another bright yellow light appeared in the same spot that the original one had.  This started moving in the same pattern as the first one, but it did not travel as far neither vertically nor horizontally.  After a few seconds, it completly dissapeared.  After about a minute, another bright yellow light appeared in the same place.  Immediatly, it started move in the same direction as the other two, in a similar pattern, but this time more erratically.  It moved rapidly, and moved in the direction of other, stationary, flashing white lights.  It seemed to be flying in the direction of one light, then would change direction towards another light.  After about another minute, an airplane appeared over the horizon in the north west, and began to turn in order to alter it's course to follow the light.  After several minutes of the plane flying after the light, more airplanes began coming over the horizon from the north east in fairly regular intervals.  I saw about 10 or 12 planes fly in the direction of the light.  While these planes were flying, there were many more flashing white lights in the sky, which flickered for a couple minutes, then stopped. All of the planes had flown away, and then nothing more happened.;33.58965;-117.7008125
Revolving light seen under moon two nights in a row.;2004-01-09 23:00:00;6 hours, 2 nights;Revolving light seen under moon two nights in a row. Bright lite object seen below the full moon in the same place both 01-09-04 and 01-10-04.  Viewed with a telescope and binoculars.  Several smaller lights were seen near the main light.  The object appeared to be revolving and appeared to have a beam of light coming from one end. The object appeared to have a slightly green/blue triangular shape.  It appeared to move back and forth, up and down but never drastically.  Also, on 01-09-04 about 4 gray objects appeared to come out of it.  It became visible about 11 PM both nights, but 01-10-04 it seemed to be a little closer.  When viewed with a telescope it appeared as a white orb, no detail, but definately is not a star. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at Sirius, although that is only a guess.  PD));33.58965;-117.7008125
