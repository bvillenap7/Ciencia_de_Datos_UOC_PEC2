stationary line of white pulsing lights;2007-07-17 19:00:00;5 minutes;While heading East on Alicia Pkwy from the intersection of Moulton / Alicia towards the intersection of Paseo De Valencia / Alicia I could see a stationary line of white pulsing lights which appeared to be hovering over Saddleback Mountain. From my perspective the object was quite far away 15-20 miles and seemed to be very large considering its distance about the size of a grain of rice at arms distance. Roughly 5-7 white pulsing lights in a row, each of which were the same size, and seemed considerably large and bright. The object maintained its position for roughly 5 minutes and suddenly disappeared. First becoming a single, distant red light, then gone from sight completely.

On Thursday April 3rd 2008 at approximately 11:50pm as I was driving home with my mom and girl friend, I notice a light in the sky moving at a slow pace.  I stopped the car right away and pointed the object to my mom and girl friend.  I knew right away that it was not a plane nor a helicopter.  The object was like a rectangle shape with a light at the bottom.  The object was going south parallel to the 5 freeway that goes to San Diego.  At the time of the sighting, it was passing over Laguna Hills Ca.  I rushed home and told my girl friend to get the camera while i waited outside the house and observed the object.  The only thing that we were able to see on the video since it was dark, is a small light moving.;33.58965;-117.7008125
