Slow moving yellow-white lights over South Orange County.;2010-11-11 23:30:00;5-7 min;Slow moving yellow-white lights over South Orange County. Myself with two friends notice a pair of white-yellow lights moving in the sky. At first we assumed it was a jet aircraft, but did not notice any other white or red lights flashing as would on a normal aircraft. There was also no sound following the object, so we then assumed it was possibly a stealth jet. But we then realized that the object was moving entirely too slow to be any type of jet aircraft we are aware of. The lights seemed to be moving east/southeast until it took a turn more south. At that point of turning, more lights appeard above and around the original pair of lights. These flashing lights were primarliy red/orange. The lights were now far in the distance, but we were able to track its movement for at least 5 minutes from when we first noticed it until a house got in our way. It seemed as though it had originated from behind our location from watching its directional movement, meaning it could have flown directly overhead, or we would have had a much closer look had we noticed it sooner. We were standing in the neighborhood of Nellie Gail, where there are many large homes. This home was towards the top of a hill, so we were able to get a good sight from the street where we were standing. We moved out of the street light once we'd noticed the object and with that light out of our eyes, we were able to see how slow the object was really moving.;33.58965;-117.7008125
