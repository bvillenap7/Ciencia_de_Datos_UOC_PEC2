Pulsating orb appears over houses and draws police attention.;2010-04-26 19:45:00;3 minutes;Pulsating orb appears over houses and draws police attention. My son was outside when he ran in to tell me that he saw a UFO outside of our house.  Out of skepticism, I went out to see what he claimed to be a bright pulsating light going up and down towards the sky.  While waiting to see what he described this light appeared out of the tree line north of our location and began to go up and down, and at times side to side while at the same time getting brighter at times as if it was getting closer to our location and then backing away as it dimmed.  I captured this on my cell phone for about a minute and a half until it drop down towards the ground as a police helicopter approached and circled the same area for about 15 minutes afterward.  This was no helicopter or airplane in the sky that we all saw.  The way it zipped back and forth, no known aircraft can do that.  I was amazed that nothing was reported on the local news agency regarding this sighting because of the length of exposure and the obvious dispatch of the police helicopter to investigate this sighting.;33.58965;-117.7008125

I picked the cat up in my arms to placate him and walked outside.  We walked out and as showing him the surroundings and that nothing was there, looking east  I noticed a very slow silent orange, almost red, fireball ascend slowly. It resembled a perfectly round fireball without sparks and ascended into very high altitude, compared to a horizon and commercial aircraft seen 30 minutes after the incident. I called for my mother who is 68 and she saw it as well. I have seen launches from Vandenberg and the color spectrum is way off. I have never seen an object go straight up so smooth, slow and HIGH and then drop for a second and disappear. I am reporting it because I can't explain it's behavior as a firework , a tracer, flare or aircraft ( absolutely silent). Would love some answers.;33.58965;-117.7008125
