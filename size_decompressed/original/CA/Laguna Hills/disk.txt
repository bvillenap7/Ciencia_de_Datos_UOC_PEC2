Something high above the planes in Orange County?;2007-10-07 11:00:00;5 - 10 minutes;Something high above the planes in Orange County? I am not sure what I saw. I had my daughter at the park and some balloons we released. When watching one of them drift off, I could see a sliver of something in the distance. It seamed to be really far away. I thought mabye it was the International Space station? I could not figure it out, I had my eye on it for at least 5 minutes, just watching when a plane flew by, you could clearly see that this craft was much higher than the plane. We are pretty close to Orange County airport, so we always see plane traffic. As I continued watching it, it made a very fast directional move, I lost eye contact with it. I continued looking in the same direction and saw it once again, it kind of moved side to side like a ping pong ball.  I would love to know what this was, if someone could let me know that would be great. I have never seen anything like this.;33.58965;-117.7008125
Green and red lights on craft very high in the sky.;2011-12-05 05:45:00;15 minutes;Green and red lights on craft very high in the sky. going down the hill on Aliso Hills Rd. Saw a bright light.  I pulled over to get a better look.  Both my passenger and I saw something very high in the sky (it was close to the moon, you had to look straight up).  It had what looked to be a green light that was clear to see then dimmed at at times but also there were 2 red lights that were flashing.  It moved in one direction for a bit then stayed in place then it changed directions going back where it had come from.;33.58965;-117.7008125
