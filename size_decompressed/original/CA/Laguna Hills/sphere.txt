These appeared to be a flock of birds at first, but a closer look revealed no apparent wings or wing-based flying motion and there also appeared to be a metallic quality visible as they turned into their circle.  The objects were circulating around in an unorganized 'follow-my-leader' kind of manner.   I ruled-out a bird formation when the circular motion appeared to be around a minimally-moving general axis tending towards a north-westerly direction.   There appeared to be 2 groups of these spheres/orbs - 1 group over the general area of Lake Forest and 1 closer west to the 5-Freeway.    As traffic progressed I was unable to keep constant eye contact and could not see the spheres in their general direction some 3 or 4 minutes later.;33.58965;-117.7008125
