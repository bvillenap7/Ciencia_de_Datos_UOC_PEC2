Starlike object observed.;2016-07-07 21:47:00;2:59 seconds;Starlike Object Observed I was completing a report to the MUFON web site regarding an object that was caught on my vehicle's dash cam and wife's cell phone on June 16, 2016.  While near completion of the report, my wife called me outside to observe 2 objects. She told me 1st object was moving very rapidly across the sky while the 2nd object was moving more slowly.  By the time I got outside I couldn't find the 1st object but I did see the 2nd object. It was moving from west to east, was reddish/white in color, and was a little larger than a star.  I ran back inside the house grabbing my Sony 8mm night vision camcorder.  I was able to record approximately 2:50 of footage of the object.  My camera did have difficulty focusing on the object so it does go in/out of focus however, I did manage some good footage of it.  The footage appears black/white/greenish due the night vision mode so the colors we observed will not be visible.  I converted the 8mm tape to a digital format so that it can be available for online viewing and uploading. Eventually, it disappeared into the night sky as it continued eastward. We did not hear any noise during the entire observation.  My family has observed similar objects near our residence the past few months.  I personally have seen strange objects in the sky, once on the ground, most of my life but this represents the 1st time I have made efforts to record them.
