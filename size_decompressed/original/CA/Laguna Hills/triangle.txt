V-Shaped low Flying Aircraft with many Red and Green Bright Lights fly 20 ft over my car.;2011-11-24 00:01:00;1 minute;V Shaped low Flying Aircraft with many Red and Green Bright Lights fly 20 ft over my car. I was driving home in the suburbs of Laguna Hills, Ca on a usually busy street, but not at 12.am. I make a left from my current street and head my ascent up a large winding quarter mile hill. As I put my foot on the gas I notice an object over head, pretty high in the sky, about 50 degrees up from my horizon. This object was red on one side and green on the other, but from a far away distance it just looked like a red and green small blob moving across the sky in a sweeping flying motion. As I neared the middle of the distance of the long street, the flying object went out of view and basically just disappeared. I don’t know of many helicopters or planes that visible or low at midnight but ill just pass it off as a normal sight. I just ignored the sighting until all of a sudden at least 20 feet above my car there was a huge v like aircraft. This aircraft was about 10 ft long side to side and had a series of about 20 large square lights from side to side on the front of the V which was facing me.  The lights on one side were green and the other 10 or so extremely bright lights were red on the other side.  Once I saw this I swear my stomach dropped and I floored my car.  All I knew was that this wasn’t any toy plane at midnight or anything else I have ever seen.  This object flew over my car in the opposite direction I was going.  As I looked above over my steering wheel I could see the lights so distinctly like it was burned into the back of my eyes.  As I quickly drove off I could see it distinctly behind me until I got to a good observation point above the small city less than 20 seconds later.  It was gone. If anyone had similar experiences, please tell, or tell me what I saw.  Thanks;33.58965;-117.7008125
