Formation that change direction and disappeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from law enforcement officer.  PD));2013-01-01 01:15:00;5 seconds;Formation that change direction and disappeared. I am a patrol officer and the past two nights I have seen strange objects on the sky.  The first was in the eastern portion of the sky and I saw there were 6 red/orange objects in a line running north to south.  The first 4 disappeared quickly after I noticed them but the last two remained for about one minute.  The one to the north disappeared order and the last one ascended and disappeared.   From what I know there was at least one call to my dispatch about the lights.  I didn't really even believe what I had seen until I heard of the other call.  I heard some loud whooshing but I don't believe it was from the objects because they were too far away.  I tried to film it but you can only barely make out one speck from the distance I was recording from. The second I saw the same looking objects but there were only 2.  I caught them moving out of the corner of my eye.  I saw one drop quickly from the sky below roof line and the second ascended slowly then zig zagged once then disappeared.  I did not hear anything on this occasion. Because they were changing from red to orange and back and because they disappeared quickly, I believe they may have been flares but their movement makes me curious about it.;36.2017;-119.3402
