I saw three bright moving objects relatively going the speed of a normal aircraft but slightly faster. Also flying slightly lower than normal aircraft's. All three were going the same direction in a line formation. They were traveling from north to south. They had no sound. All three were the same exact color and brightness. I captured all three on video with my phone.;36.2017;-119.3402
