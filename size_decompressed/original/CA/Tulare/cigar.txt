Shiny, cigar-shaped, object hovering.;2016-07-15 13:25:00;1 minute;Shinny Cigar Shaped Object Hovering On July 15th, 2016, a bright sunny clear day, at about 1:25 pm, while driving east on Sandra Ave and Oakâ€™s St in Tulare, Ca.  I looked up and saw what at first I thought was a helicopter at about 3,000 to 5,000 feet high.  I asked my wife to check it out?  What as it a helicopter?  Just hovering there not going nowhere?  Then my wife and I got to looking at it closer it was just sitting hovering over on the same place the entire time.  We noticed it did not appear to have wings it was cigar shaped shiny silver-blueish in color.  I notice it appeared to have like a glass dome over the top.  But it had no wings.   After watching if for about a minute it just disappeared.  In front our very eyes. There was not a cloud in the sky and clear and sunny about 96 degrees.;36.2017;-119.3402
