June 7, 2008  I saw an unexplained object in the sky over Tulare, CA on June 7, 2008 at 9:10 PM.  It was a round object of amber color.  It was hovering over some houses to the east of my home.  It slowly progressed in horizontal fashion, and then stopped.  It again started moving, slowly, then again it stopped.  Suddenly, when an airplane was approaching, it shot straight up and out of sight.  This occurrence has happened before.  Over the last month, I have seen many of these objects.  During the day, there are silverfish orbs hovering in daylight.  Sometimes there are three or four at most moving together, other times they are spread apart in the sky and then come together and move in unison with one another.  The groups move forward and backward, then suddenly disappear.;36.2017;-119.3402
