I was a passenger in my friends car, he was driving, heading up the coast from Santa Cruz to Davenport.  About half way to our destination there's an S curve that cuts through a little valley. It was a Clear starry night, we weren't under the influence of any type and were going about 45 mph when I look up and Instantly my heart Froze, every hair in my body was sticking straight up (goosebumps), absolutely SPEECHLESS and shocked my world stopped for about 5 seconds looking at this  BLUE glowing Round object as it hovers and spinning clockwise and in the middle there is a ring with smaller Circles illuminated blue was spinning the opposite way.  When I first saw it, it was descending slightly, then ascended and took off in a zigzag pattern, almost felt like we were about to be abducted with the car, FAST like from 40 to 100 to 200 mph.  I said to my friend,  That was a UFO, right?  The only thing he said was I don't know what else it could have been.  If only I c! an PLUg my thoughts on a Screen and produce a CONFIRMED Visual IMAGE of this Amazing thing.  Hook me up to a lie detector and ill pass.  I am an honest man and I am not lying and haven't told anybody, because I know what they'll be like all typical and stuff.  I thought this site would be good.  I know what I saw was real and it is not from this earth, I can guarantee that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
