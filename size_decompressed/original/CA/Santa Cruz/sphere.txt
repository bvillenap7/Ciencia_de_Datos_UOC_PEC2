2 objects above Santa cruz Mnts.;1999-08-25 21:30:00;7 minutes;2 objects above Santa cruz Mnts. Aug. 25th Wednesday evening at 9:30pm I noticed two bright orange lights on a ridge across a valley while standing in my back yard, I Immediately called my husband to come take a look, at first I thought maybe they were fire trucks on the ridge, but as I looked through the my binoculars I realized that they were not Fire trucks, but were actually about 15 degrees above the ridge moving in the a South West direction. I couldn't make out a definite shape, only they were round and and glowed like a flame, they never flickered and I couldn't see any lights other than this orange glow. I followed them through my binoculars as they moved slowly above the ridge for about 5 minutes, then they both seem to stop moving for about 30 second, then one of them moved down and behind the other side of the ridge and I could no longer see it, the second one stayed still, just hovering there above the ridge for about 30 seconds, as I watched it, it just turn off ? Like turning off a light. It didn't move up or down like the other one had, it just dissapeared right in front of my eyes ? My Husband and I are amateur star gazer, we've seen quite a few interesting things up here in the Santa Cruz Mtns, like Muir and a couple of comets, but I've never seen anything like this !;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Almost translucent sphere travelling at high speed/altitude across Santa Cruz, CA during the day.;2002-08-31 14:00:00;5 seconds;Almost translucent sphere travelling at high speed/altitude across Santa Cruz, CA during the day. I was lying on Santa Cruz beach, approx. 50 meters east of the main pier/wharf. I spotted a light in the sky and I watched it thinking it was an airoplane, as there are many commercial flights whose path is almost directly above the beach. These planes are usually travelling in a northerly direction, heading for San Jose airport. However the object I watched was travelling extremely fast and made no sound. It moved in an exactly straight line from east to west. To help describe the speed, imagine lying on your back with your feet pointing south, hands pointing out and the sky above is one half of a clock face: your left hand is east and also 12 o'clock the right hand is west and 6 o'clock. I spotted the object at around 1 o'clock and watched it travel until 5 o'clock in less than 5 seconds. As the object moved it was completely silent and left no trails. It appeared to go through brightness changes, as if light was being internally reflected off the inside of a sphere. The brightness changes were as linear as the object's motion. I have watched many planes over the skies here and this was not a plane (well, not a normal one anyway).;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Observed 10-12 metallic spheres, flying in formation, during daylight flying from Santa Cruz Mtns toward Monterey Bay.;2006-03-11 17:40:00;2 minutes;Observed 10-12 metallic spheres, flying in formation, during daylight flying from Santa Cruz Mtns toward Monterey Bay. I was outside in my back yard talking on the phone to my daughter who said my 4 yr old granddaughter wanted to talk to me.   I heard a low roaring sound like a jet and instinctly looked up toward the east for the plane, while I listened to my granddaughter ramble.  I saw a metallic flash through the tree branches and thought there's the plane.  But then, I saw several other metallic flashes and I stepped out into the open looking up.  There was a configuration of 10-12 metallic-type balls.  At first I thought they were balloons, but that didn't make sense.  Then I thought they must be birds which also made no sense.  The sky was clear blue but was surrounded by heavy clouds to the east over the Santa Cruz mountains.  I watched as they seem to float across the sky and I kept trying to figure out what they were.  There were no fins, appendages or moving parts.  They were perfectly spherical and silver.  Then I realized they were flying in a formation of several groups of three to four in each group.  The center group consisted of three.  They seemed perfectly spaced.  Suddenly, the left sphere in the lead group instantly dipped towards the lead sphere and then darted back into its previous location.  I watched them move from northeast to southwest heading towards the Monterey Bay.  I called the newspaper to find out if anyone else had reported seeing spheres in the sky flying in formation. They told me no.  I live approximately four blocks from West Cliff Drive in Santa Cruz City.   The weather had cleared, the sun had been shining for a couple of hours and so I know there had to be lots of people jogging, surfing and walking their dogs.   I can't believe I am the only one who witnessed this phenomena.  I talked to my husband, who has a Ph.d in quantum physics and chemistry.  He suggested balloons..maybe someone let a bunch of balloons go at the same time---but as I told him    Since when do balloons fly in formation?   I used to work on the original F/A-18 program at Patuxent Naval Air Station.  I know a little something about aircraft.  These were no aircraft and were definitely metal or metallic.  They were so bright with the sun shining on them.   The only other observation I found weird was the silence.  The air was still, there were no birds singing, everything was just quiet.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531

Orange light ejects flares.;2013-02-03 18:15:00;1-3 minutes;Orange light ejects flares Just as the second half of the Superbowl was starting I took out the trash, and I saw a bright orange light that appeared to be flying over Santa Cruz or maybe further south over Capitola or Aptos.  The light did not blink and seemed unusually bright for an aircraft.  It moved smoothly north at first, but later changed direction and headed south and down towards the ocean in the middle of the Monterey Bay.  Before disappearing below the tree line, it shot what looked like a line of about 10 flares UPWARD in a rapid fire manner that only took about five seconds.  The flares didn't fall, but seemed to float in place for about 10 or 15 seconds then disappeared.  At first I thought this was a helicopter, because I heard the sound of a helicopter nearby, but soon it became apparent that there was indeed a helicopter moving north, but it continued north even after the orange light changed direction.  There was no discernible sound coming from the orange light nor its fl! ares.   There is a constant stream of planes flying north over Santa Cruz day and night, but this light seemed to be much lower than the usual planes, and I could see a plane fly above it at what I guess to be about 5000 feet - I think the light was at about 2000 feet before it moved downward towards the ocean.  It seems likely that other craft in the sky would have seen it too.   I tried driving down the street to a better vantage point to see where it went, but I saw nothing.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Sphere appears in the second of three consecutive photos, and then disappears.  ((NUFORC Note:  Object later identified.  PD));2014-05-01 10:30:00;Snapshot;Sphere appears in the second of three consecutive photos, and then disappears. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness submitted an addendum to the report, identifying the object.  PD))   Arrived at the beach around 10:30 am with a couple who’ve been friends for over 30 years, to meet with their daughter, her husband and two children.  We walked up and down the beach strolling the baby and when we got back, I sat on the towel under an umbrella and thought it would be cute to have a photo of their daughter in the foreground, with the grandparents walking with her older son. The first frame I took with my phone in portrait mode. I decided to flip to landscape mode for the next two shots. I didn't see anything in the frame when I took the shot, and there weren't any kites or balls flying through the air. The beach was not very crowded on a Thursday (May 1st). After I left Santa Cruz, drove to my next stop (Napa) and while I was getting fuel, I thought I’d review the photos I took in Santa Cruz. That’s when I noticed the sphere in the sky. I saw nothing like it that day at the beach, so I assume it is some anomaly with my digital software. Even so, I feel compelled to share the photo, because it is just too strange! I’m hoping you can debunk it or have an explanation that makes sense.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
satellite like looking objects single file line, orderely flying in perfection, 30 or so of them, wow!!!!!

I was looking at the night sky when I thought I saw a satellite, I watched it for a few seconds before it disappeared, I then noticed several more following in the same direction, all equal distant apart, I counted 30 in a row that were going West to East;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
