It had a tail that was greenish with sparks in it. No sound. I came out of my friend's house about 11:46pm on April 21, 1998. I walked to the end of her drive towards my car and saw this comet-like thing in the sky. I looked towards her house and she had just closed the door. I knew if I went to get her, by the time she got there it would be gone & I wanted to see more, so I watched by myself. It went from the top of the sky, down past the horizon, right to left. I saw it for about 15 seconds. It was a circle that was a little bit bigger than a dinner plate from where I was and it had a tail that was greenish and had sparks in it, sort of like the sparks from when a knife is being sharpened. It reminded me of a comet, but much, much bigger. It didn't make any sound. It moved quickly,but not as quick as a shooting star & it didn't disappear into the atmosphere like a shooting star -- it remained the same size & I could see it clearly until it disappeared past the horizon line. I'm a mother of 3 children and a childbirth educator.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Red balls of light seen over Monterey Bay in Santa Cruz, CA.  Many witnesses.;1999-04-28 20:30:00;5-10 minutes;Red balls of light seen over Monterey Bay in Santa Cruz, CA.  Many witnesses. Red ball of light, with a trail, faliing in sky like a flare, but then slowly picking up altitude again, then fallling and rising again...the red light fading in and out.  Disappeared suddenly.  5 separate red balls of light aligned next to each other, one at a time, bright flash as each appeared. Moved around, side to side, up and down, for a few minutes. All disappeared suddenly.  Many witnesses watched over Pleasure Point, others driving by pulled over to ask if we had also seen the strange lights?.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Fire that rose in the night's sky in Santa Cruz, CA;2013-06-13 22:30:00;4 minutes;fire that rose in the night's sky in Santa Cruz, CA I was in the backyard facing the ocean.   A big ball of flame slowly rose above the rooftops from the west, getting smaller as it rose and proceeded southwest, where my sister saw it, and headed north as it got further up and out of sight.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
3 fire balls over pescadero (santa cruz, CA).;2013-12-25 22:00:00;still going;3 fire balls over Pescadero (Santa Cruz, CA). got off work to find my neighbor staring at the ocean waving me over.  He pointed out what seemed to be flickering star. as we watched it darted up and down, left and right, diagonal and it was FAST.  it was pretty far away so at the speed it was moving was pretty intense to look as quick as it did from our point of view.  He said he had been watching for about 30 min.  It stuck with me more because he is an ex-military helicopter pilot- and might know a thing or two about flight.  I drove back over to my restaurant to show the kitchen guys, 2 waiters a busser, a kitchen guy and even 3 customers (the waiter told them) came out to see.  At that point there were 2 'fireballs' and one had a light shining down on the water.  It was really far out we could not make out the shape or what the light was on other than the water.  After a few min we all went back inside then a second kitchen guy wanted to see, when we went back out there were 3. the far left one was the most volatile moving erratically.  The middle one was the brightest but slower to move and would appear and disappear randomly.  The far right one was the most calm and the one with the light.  The light turned off, it went straight up then diagonal out of sight.   Now i am afraid to go to sleep!   If anyone knows what else that could be that would be welcomed!!;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Reddish/Orange ball of light seen over Monterey Bay.;2013-12-31 19:30:00;5 minutes;Reddish/Orange ball of light seen over Monterey Bay. My wife, three friends and I were leaving the Crow’s Nest restaurant adjacent the harbor in Santa Cruz, CA after having New Year’s Eve dinner.  We’d started about 5:00 and enjoyed a good meal and conversation.  None of us had had anything to drink, and we wanted to get home relatively early.  We’re not big revelers…  While we walked through the parking lot to our cars, I looked to the southwest, out over Monterey Bay, and noticed a reddish-orange, round ball of light in the sky.  I initially took it to be aircraft headlights, as there is a flight path that crosses the bay heading to SFO and planes’ lights can often be seen.  I reconsidered almost immediately though and mentioned it to my wife and friends, joking that there was a UFO in the sky.  They all looked and saw it as well. What made me reconsider my observation was, first, its color.  Plane headlights are white.  This was definitely a reddish orange.  Secondly, there was no apparent movement.  Planes usually have at least some offset of their flight path relative to the viewer that causes some appearance of lateral movement.  This had none.  It stood still in the air.  Third, it appeared wider than the aircraft lights one normally sees in the sky at night.  I’d guess that it looked nearly as wide as a pencil eraser held at arm’s length.  It was about 30 degrees about the horizon. The object stayed fixed in place for several minutes while we chatted and readied to leave.  This enhanced its oddness to us, so we were all watching it when, in the course of a few seconds, it grew brighter and larger, then disappeared.  I thought I recalled it moving slightly to the right as it brightened, but my wife doesn’t remember that. After it disappeared, I suggested that it must have been a Chinese lantern.  I’ve heard of such being floated in the night sky before, and being mistaken for UFO’s, but I’ve never knowingly seen one.  It seemed plausible at the time though. I’d of left it at that but for catching you on C2C yesterday (1/1/14) describing multiple reports of what sounds remarkably like what we witnessed.  We were startled to hear you talk of many reddish orange balls of light being reported in the last day, because this is exactly what we saw.   I knew then that I needed to write this, my first ever UFO sighting report.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531

I pulled over and they began flying straight up at the sky.  Theyd get pretty high up, then suddenly disappear.  As we watched more would come up.  Some would go up, then down, then up, again, before disappearing, but they all disappeared at the same point in the sky.  It was a little overcast.   Then I saw one part of the sky light up but only once and for a secomd.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
