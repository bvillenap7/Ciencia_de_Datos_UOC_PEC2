Strange craft observed over Santa Cruz CA.;1996-04-11 12:44:00;5 minutes;Strange craft observed over Santa Cruz CA. I first observed the craft as a bright white light coming in over Monterey Bay. It appeared to be a landing light from an aircraft which was much to low to clear the mountains for a landing in San Jose. On my way outside I noticed the time as 12:44 am. The craft passed over at approx. 1-2000 ft. and at a viewing angle of approx. 45 degrees from vertical. It was approx. the length of an airliner and cylinder shaped and rounded at both ends. There were 7 round porthole shaped openings along the side and 5 square areas colored as if subjected to heat. There was a horizontal circular ring that had movement like liquid moving around the ring. There were vertical lines of descending from the rings that came together as an apex to form a cone. The cone in front was a light gray color and the one at the rear looked like liquid gold moving around the ring and upt the vertical lines. When it passed from my view I returned inside my house and took note of the time. It was 12:49am. The next day I took compass bearings and determined its course at approx. 355 degrees magnetic.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Changing lights over Santa Cruz CA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  PD));2006-02-08 23:00:00;At least 1 hour;Changing lights over Santa Cruz CA I stood outside my apt smoking a ciggarette when I noticed an odd set of lights south east of my position. They rotated from red to white. At first I thought it may be a radio tower of some sort then realized there is no tower on the nearest hill and even if there was the lights would be closer and the tower over 1000 ft high. If it was one craft it was definetly cylyndrical in shape, but I believe it may have been 2. They hovered one over another for at least an hour and I can see from my window that they are still in position as Im typing this. Im former military and no loon I know how to identify aircraft and these are no aircraft Ive ever seen or heard of. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius, we suspect.

Three rockets above Santa Cruz, no explanation;2020-05-01 16:00:00;2 minutes;Three rockets above Santa Cruz, no explanation I was laying flat on the ground looking up. I was on Coral Street in Santa Cruz.Three rockets, all brown in color, with  the shape of the new SpaceX rockets, flew from North to South across the sky in a period of two minutes. They were very clear but and seemed to be low to the ground but I heard no noise. They all left vapor trails that disappeared after twenty seconds. They all appeared the same but the color was very brown. It was strange because three came in a row, one right after the other and I've never seen a real rockets in the sky before. It was extremely odd. I've never seen these kind of rockets on tv or heard reports of rockets launching from Mountain View, Santa Clara before. I think that one rocket may have split the earth into three dimensions by launching them and that's maybe what I witnessed. I think we might be splitting the earth into multiple dimensions by traveling in height above the surface. Do we really know all the effects we are c! ausing in time and space with the act of traveling to space? I reported I saw an airplane fly into space and another thing I want to say is that I hear strange noises all the time above Santa Cruz that sound like space ships and how do we know if someone like Elon Musk is not running their own space fleet right now? Is space even monitored?;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
