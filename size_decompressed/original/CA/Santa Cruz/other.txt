This took place at the campus of UC at Santa Cruz  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of YO-3A??  PD));1985-05-01 14:00:00;10-15 seconds;This took place at the campus of University of California at Santa Cruz   While walking to class I hear a flooppping sound.  I looked up above the redwoods....maybe 20 feet above them....so say about 50-70 feet in the air I see a White plane.  Cessna sized....the plane was all white with with a a very large propeller in the front. The plane made almost no sound, and was incredibly low to the ground. On the left hand side from underneath a pod with a long antenna came from behind.  It was mounted under the wind.  Clynder probably about 8-10 feet long with a 3-4 foot antenna out the back. The sound fo the twapping sound which was faint would be about once every 7/10ths of second. The angle of the hill had the plane going North to South and downhill.  It was almost gliding.  There were no markings on the plane at all.  Zero....nothing on the tail or under wings.  I had a viewing angle from side...then I quickly ran to see it going away  I have basically assumed this was a sample of Military spy craft...as Lockheed has a development above the University. If flying at night...and or painted black.....this craft could fly overhead of people or areas with very very little notice. I am sure I saw this.....and lean towards earthly device...but would be classified.  It was like a glider with a huge propeller.  The body was more substantial than a glider...more like Cessana. If you need more info....I would be fine with calling back after you email.  This was not anything that would fly from a normal airport....unless I missed hearing about a virtually silent plane. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed the YO-3A, a silent aircraft designed for use in Viet Nam.  It used to fly out of Moffett Field in San Jose.  It is built on a glider frame, and is similar in appearance to what the witness describes.  PD));37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
4 dim lights  lt  orange in color flying extremely low just above redwood tree line totally silent;1990-08-24 01:00:00;5 seconds;4 dim lights  lt  orange in color flying extremely low just above redwood tree line totally silent I walked out on my back deck. I noticed it was extremely dark out and extremely clear sky.  something made me look up when i did i noticed 4 lights moving on an object directly above my home.  It was absolutley silent the 4 lights were under the object which appeared to be in somewhat of a square in shape the lights were not bright they were dim and had an orange tint. it was moving from the south (away from the ocean) to the north, it seemed to be flying just above the treeline (redwood tree) of the tree next door it moved at a slow steady speed as it passed over my house i yelled for my wife as I ran through the house to front door in hopes it would still be in view from the front yard.  it was gone.  It took me a few minutes to comprehend what I had just seen.  I phoned 911 to inquire whether anyone else had reported seeing any strange low flying objects, i was referred to the faa.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531

Material did not look like metal The craft moved very quickly through the sky, it looked nothing like an airplane, and moved too quickly to be one.  Although it did move quickly, it was easy to see the craft in detail.  After about 15 min .  of following the craft it was gone.  The craft did not come close to land, it remained high in the sky.  The craft looked like a disk with three to four poles comming out of the top.  It did not look like it was made out of metal, but some other almost cloud like material. The craft was white. I was not able to see the material it was made of easily, as it was high in the sky on a very sunny day.  I know more people saw this.  The beach was crowded and many people were looking at the craft. I am a student at a nearby university;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Three lights across the horizon slowly travelling from side to side seeming to dip into the water then flying high above. They were far;1999-09-09 22:00:00;Several hous;Three lights across the horizon slowly travelling from side to side seeming to dip into the water then flying high above. They were far away The bright lights were obviously wery far away yet they at times travelled at very high speeds that seemed impossible. The lights were far away from eachother at times but seemed to mirror eachothers movements. At times, they would be directly on top of eachother moving in the same bizaar manner. A manner that did not seem logical for human purposes.  I thought perhaps rescue helicopters far off shore but I ruled this out because of the incredible speed and the bizaar nature of these lights.  The lights were mostly white but had glimpses of color from time to time.  They were solid lights though, that never dimmed.  My friend and I watched for hours and I fear that we will never Know what we saw.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Moon in different places in the sky.;2001-07-15 22:00:00;60 seconds;Moon in different places in the sky. The moon is setting in a different place again. On 07/12/01 I saw the moon set over my house directly west and three days later the moon set directly over to south in the sky about twenty feet south west, then it set three nights before. I reported that I saw the moon rise in the east and then saw it rise in the south two months ago. I think the Earth is wobbling right now from these observations. I think there is a very large space ship near the earth as to why the earth would be wobbling and the moon would appear so far off in it's orbit from night to night. Plus, there was snow on the hills this week in California during July.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Orange floating disappearing lights.;2014-04-26 21:00:00;5 minutes;Orange floating disappearing lights. I saw orange hovering lights that disappeared after a few minutes in the sky.  Like their light fizzled like a smoke being extinguished.   The first time was about 2 months ago & I woke my husband for him to witness them.  The first time I saw them these orange hovering lights that disappeared after a few minutes in the sky.  Like their light fizzled like a smoke being extinguished they reminds me of miniature this is the second time I’ve seen them.   The first time I saw them they seemed far away.  the first time there were lots of the & they appeared to be floating up then disappearing.   This time. they were moving kinda like a drone but more bubble floating like, & they came super close to the rooftops & very close to my house.  About 25 ft off the ground. I have never seen anything this scary in my life & I don’t ever use the Internet for leaving comments anywhere.  This video is exactly what I saw the first time:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bsrHjd4mPU;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Stratospheric Blue Light Beam tracking Orange Sun Ball.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 19:00:00;~7 minutes;Stratospheric Blue Light Beam tracking Orange Sun Ball. Traveling home by south east phenomenon of blue light and hue filled my windshield.  I observed that the beam of blue light was at a stratospheric altitude and projecting like a giant search light.  The beam diffused into a conical shape around a focused blue beam that was almost like a neon blue in color.   I pulled over to observe and saw that the blue beam appeared to be tracking something to the north across the sky.  The object it seemed to be pointing at or following, was like an orange ball,  This object was radiating like a sun, projecting a yellow orange beam back at the blue beam, all while on the move to the north.  The orange ball/sun had a conical shaped beam of orange that was directed down to Earth.   Neighbors confirmed sighting, and also other neighbors could be heard calling out if anyone is seeing this.
