looked like a shooting star, but stars don't move that way.;1999-09-01 01:00:00;1 minute;looked like a shooting star, but stars don't move that way. This happened a while ago.  It was my freshman year in college and I went to play some midnight basketball with some friends.  The basketball courts where we were had enough lights for us to play.  We were playing a full court game, when all of a sudden everyone playing basketball stopped and looked at the night sky.  We saw a white tiny light.  At first I thought it was a shooting start, but as it was soaring though the sky it stopped for a couple seconds, moved from left to right, and then shot right back from where it started and then disappeared.  Someone stated that it may have been a satellite, but whatever it was, it scared the shit out of us cause we took off running back to the dorms.

It was perfectely still for a very long time and then it sarted to move vertically. Then it moved across the sky and it had four other lights. One of which was flashing. It was moving faster than an airplane and it made no sound. Since it was night I did not see the shape. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) july. sorry I got my months mixed up.

A pair of orange lights rapidly crossed tha Santa Cruz sky.;2004-04-23 21:20:00;under 10 seconds;A pair of orange lights rapidly crossed tha Santa Cruz sky. While outside my home observing the positions of the planets Saturn, Mars, and Venus, I saw a pair of lights moving together across the sky in a South-to-North direction.  The lights moved at a high speed, crossing from horizon to horizon in an estimated 6 seconds, straight and close to the zenith, many times faster than any aircraft or satellite that I have observed. The lights maintained their position relative to each other, but I couldn't see whether they were part of the same craft.  One light was behind and to the left of the other  if one imagines a triangle moving point-first with lights on the leading point and on the leftmost point behind, with no light on the right, then one can get an idea of what I saw. The lights had an orange color similar to that of a sodium street lamp.  The sky was slightly hazy, and the haze appeared to be at a very high altitude, since a commercial jet observed a moment later appeared very clearly.  The lights of the unidentified object, on the other hand, looked as if they were above the haze.  No sound could be heard, though I listened for a long time (since the sound of fast-moving aircraft can seem to lag behind the image).  The apparent altitude and speed of the object were such that I stood agape for a few moments.  This is the only time I have seen something in the sky that I could not identify.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Balls of bright orange lights seen hovering over city and disappearing up into sky from Santa Cruz Lighthouse.;2014-02-14 21:45:00;5-10 minutes;Balls of bright orange lights seen hovering over city and disappearing up into sky from Santa Cruz Lighthouse. It was between the time of 21:45-22:00.  The two objects hovering over the city lights, west of the beach cliff that my husband and I were standing on (The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk was in our view to the right of us).   We could not see any true shapes but they both looked like a ball of orange lights.  I think of a soccer ball, with the black patches being the orange lights and the rest of the white patches being just black.   They hovered over the city area, the first one hovered in the same spot for at least 5 minutes and then began moving to the right.   It only moved in this direction for a minute or so, and then it halted suddenly and at that moment, it ascended up into the sky and disappeared as balloon does when it is released into the sky.   The other one followed this same pattern and ascended in the exact location in the sky as the first.  It took about 45 seconds for each one to completely disappear.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Craft emitting large white vapor cone with green beam tail.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:13:00;1 minute;Craft emitting large white vapor cone with green beam tail. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD)) An aircraft was moving across the sky over the ocean at the harbor, emitting a massive white lighted vapor into a triangular shape which continued to expand, and then a neon light like a beam came out of the back end like a tail. We were unable to determine the shape of the craft, it seemed either at quite a high altitude, or tiny. A few small circular puffs appeared behind the the craft as it disengaged from its creation. We could still see the craft as the white light or vapor began to dissipate. The green was the color of the northern lights and was still faintly visible when we stopped watching.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531

Everyone in the van was a sleep except me because we had been driving all night. I was watching the waves crash on the beach. I looked down at my phone for a second and looked up and saw a floating object above the water. I thought it was a helicopter. But there was no noise and there was no wind coming from it. It also couldn’t be a airplane because airplanes can’t stay in one spot. It sat there for about two minutes and then flew away over the houses next to where we are parked. And I never saw again.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
