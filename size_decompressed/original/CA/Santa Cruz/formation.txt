Group of lights moving and changing direction through the sky in Santa Cruz, CA 4/16/2010 @ 10:15 p.m.;2010-04-16 22:15:00;30 seconds;Group of lights moving and changing direction through the sky in Santa Cruz, CA 4/16/2010 @ 10:15 p.m. Objects appeared in the sky that looked like stars moving across.  Then one slowed down and went in a different direction and the other three that were visable slowed down and moved apart slightly.  They changed directions towards the one that left and then they all came back together in an easterly direction and then there appeared to be six of them flying very close together, almost touching.  They continued going north-east until we couldn't see them anymore.  The strange thing was that they changed speed, direction and seemed to hover at times. there was no noise, they were just lit like stars.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
Formation of 10 to 15 bright red-orange lights appeared over Monterey Bay in California.;2012-11-11 18:15:00;1-2 minutes;Formation of 10 to 15 bright red-orange lights appeared over Monterey Bay in California In the early evening on a clear night sky with calm winds (confirmed by weather stations), numerous (10 to 15) bright red-orange lights were seen over the Monterey Bay, in the central coast of California.  The lights appeared near the surface of the bay and looked to be slightly vibrating. However, there was no noise associated with the lights.  The formation of lights behaved analogously to a flock of birds in the sky.  Initially the formation was extremely tightly packed together near the ocean's surface.  The lights moved very fluently and had floating like motions in which the lights had the ability to move smoothly in all directions(up, down, right, left, etc.).   The lights began to spread out in a purposeful way with a triangular formation of three lights in the center (near the rear of fleet) remaining close together in that small triangle shape.  The lights were moving outward towards the open pacific ocean from the bay.  The lights that spread the furthest and were closer to the direction towards open ocean disappeared 1st then the rest sequentially disappeared, but almost simultaneously.  The light that was the closest to the oceans surface was the last to disappear but only by a small fraction.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
