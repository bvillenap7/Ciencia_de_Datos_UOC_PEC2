Stoped and waffled alittle and was joined by 6 or so smaller orbs of light..on every 1/2 sec or so just above each other in a sequence..blinked slowly on and off then moved slow in formation one after another to tthe right and changed shape and then faded slowly . I was walking my daughter home in the early evening....as we approched the long drive in to her mothers apartment complex we saw what looked like a meteor..very large and beautiful if a bit slow. I thought .. a comet?? But it was goldish and throwing a long orangish trail of sparks...then it did a slow upward swirl and I just about lost it...We had to move 30 ft or so with our view blocked by trees untill we reached the driveway where we saw it again and this confimed that it was quite distant and not a kite or somethig close by. Two other people shouted...Can you see it?? What the heck is it??? We hurred up to join them looking about 15 degrees about the SE horizon into 98% darkend sky. The object was waffleing to and fro fading in and out geting larger and then smaller. It is hard to say how large but I would estimate at least fifty feet or so in diameter.. maybe much larger. It was whitish to gold..mostly gold or amber. after about 30 sec or so just above the first object a smaller by 1/5 or so light appeared just for a sec followed by another just above it and then another and another...about 6 in all additional smaller lights. It was compleatly in sinc one after another in a stack above the large object. They then twinkled a little and moved one at a time of to the right each one further than the previous changing shape near the end of travel into a kind of oblong fluidlike blob and slowly fading out. This was I guess 2min or so and they twinkeled and swirlled around and took off...fading as they went. We saw the strobes of approaching aircraft(conventional) moving in from the west...and that was it.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531

Tha craft seemed to rotate,as it flew across the sky, and was almost transparent in nature.  It seemed as if you could see right through it, but definitely had a shape and lights around it. From the way it was moving, it seemed to leave some sort of trail,it almost reminded me of when you see a ship re-entering the atmosphere and there are vapor streams from friction or something. We all saw it zoom across for about 10 seconds or so and then disappeared.  It did not make any noise whatsover. We were all at awe of this insident.  This happened in Santa Cruz, California, Thanksgiving evening. Did anyone else see it?;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
