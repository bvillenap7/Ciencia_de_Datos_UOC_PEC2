Shiny, silver, metallic disc with three small lights horizontaly side by side on the outer edge and rotated.;2001-05-05 12:00:00;20 minutes;Shiny, silver, metallic disc with three small lights horizontaly side by side on the outer edge and rotated. During the first half of the year 2001 I was living in the surfing town of Santa Cruz, California. Around the first or second week of the month of May I was sitting in my bedroom one Saturday afternoon.  It was a perfect California sky.  All blue with no clouds at all.  I was sitting in a beach chair that had very short legs so I was very low to the floor and I was facing towards the north. I had a very large picture window and from the vantage point of my beach chair being low I could see a large portion of the sky above the Santa Cruz Mountains/Silicon Valley region.  The only object that I could see was the top portion the telephone pole outside with one wire going the length of the window I was looking through.  After about five minutes of looking at the sky to the north I noticed a tiny flicker of light way up in the sky.  After a few more minutes I realized that it was not moving, so I payed more attention to it.  The flicker and non-movement made me doubt that it was a plain.  So I got up and went to the window. I am fortunate to have perfect 20/20 vision and focused extremely hard on the light.  Once I settled my vision I noticed that it was NOT a plain but something odd.  I continued watching it a little longer and could make out a circular shape around the flickering light.  I then went into the living room and got a pair of old binoculars that had one broken lense.  I used the telephone pole and the wire as a reference point to locate the object with the one lense that worked, and then focused in on it.  After I settled my arms and got the best focus I could I was shocked to be looking at a U.F.O.  It was a silver metallic disc with three, small, round lights on the outer edge of the disc.  They were side by side and very close together.  The lights spun around the disc as it rotated in place.  The disc was at a bit of an angle and was reflecting the sun off the top of the disc causing it to flicker with the lights. The disc would also get caught in turbulence every few seconds and wobble as it spun around. I tried to time the spin by watching the lights and I estimated that a complete rotation of the lights took about 1 and a half seconds up to two seconds.  The craft appeared to be up at commercial airline heights of 25,000 to 35,000 feet.  Plus when I watched it with my naked eyes it seemed to be about the size of a commercial jetliner.  From the time I first noticed the flicker to the end when my eyes got tired I am guessing I watched it for about 20 minutes. My final portion of this report I would like to state clearly, the same way each witness did during the 2001 U.F.O. Press Club conference in Washington D.C. that I will testify in front of Congress to what I witnessed on that day in May of 2001 in Santa Cruz, California.

A large, metalic disc over the silcon valley region of California.;2001-10-15 12:00:00;30 minutes;A large, metalic disc over the silcon valley region of California. One Saturday afternoon I was just sitting in a chair in my bedroom. The chair was facing a large picture window exposing the northern sky towards the Santa Cruz mountains. My eyes happen to catch a small reflection of light bouncing off an object very high in the sky. I staired at the object for about 5 minutes. After realizing it was not a plane I got a pair of binoculars. Once focusing in on the object I quickly realized I was looking at a silver, metalic saucer spinning in place high in the sky. The disc also had a pair of lights spinning around the outer edge of the disc at a very rapid rate. After watching it non-stop for about 10 minutes I got the impression that it was at least 30 to 50 thousand feet in the air and the saucer must have been as big as a football field. The most shocking thing about it was that it was in the middle of the day without a cloud in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD));37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
