I was standing outside in my driveway when I saw them coming from the Monterey Bay/ocean area and heading in a northwest direction. I believe it was the same craft reported on your site seen in San Jose that night.  It came from the southeast (Monterey Bay) and was heading northwest.  I also thought it was a plane going to the San Jose or SFO Airport until it flew over me. At that point I noticed it was going too slow to be an airplane, although my friend said wow a stealth bomber!. There was no sound, it was very low, very large and moved slowly over us, over my house toward the Santa Cruz Mountains. Once over the mountains it would be in the San Jose area. There were very large unblinking lights on each tip that showed the shape of the craft as it flew overhead as a triangle. I wish I spent more time observing it but since my friend said stealth bomber that's what I thought it was.  It was only later I realized a stealth bomber would probably be going much faster, be flying much higher, and make noise.  As I noticed, the lights were so bright that they clearly revealed the shape as triangular. Time on this report is approximate.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
I saw a black triangular aircraft flying at an altitude between 300 - 500 feet - it was HUGE (bigger than  any plane I've ever seen), c;2002-04-18 21:45:00;30 seconds;I saw a black triangular aircraft flying at an altitude between 300 - 500 feet - it was HUGE (bigger than  any plane I've ever seen), completely BLACK except for a yellow light at each tip, and it was completely SOUNDLESS as it flew almost directly above me traveling at a normal pace for planes. This all took place as I was staring into the night sky sitting at a bus stop. Was it commercial? NO! Was it military? If it was, then I'm curious why I didn't know such an aircraft even existed. And just what would the military be doing flying this secret craft so low over Santa Cruz anyway? Was it an alien aircraft? I want to say no - but to me it's kind of just unexplainable. Also I want to add that I wasn't on any drug's or alcohol. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS)) ATTENTION: Web Master. I actually filed a report with you  a couple day's ago, and I noticed it had not been posted yet. I was hoping I could change a few thing's, I originally reported the date as being 4/21/2002 - it actually was 4/18/2002. Also, the time I reported was 21:45 - it actually was 20:50. I had found a note I wrote myself the night it happened with the correct info.  I have read a lot of other triangle reports, I can't believe that many people have seen this triangle. Although most description's are very different from mine, some are very similar. I would like to change my mind on being contacted by an investigator, as long as it is discreet.

Triangle Dim Lights, Silent, See-Through, and very Fast;2004-03-22 19:00:00;2 seconds;Triangle Dim Lights, Silent, See-Through, and very Fast A friend and I were looking up at the stars, remarking on how the constellations seemed very close together, extra high or something, when to the right of orion's belt, a triangular shape moved at the speed of light toward the North. It was silent and fast, really fast. It was clear or see-through (cloaked?). But, you could clearly see the shape of the triangle because 3 dim lights outlined it. Everyone we told acted like we were seeing things. It was nice to connect with this site to see others share our experiences. At the end of December, we also saw a bright object move slowly and then seem to turn red, orange, and fade away. It was in the sky for over 5 minutes. Many of us saw it that night. We were outside at a party. It happened in the same area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
three white patches forming a dim triangle (looked like one craft) flying completely silently, low, and at constant speed (fast) North.;2009-03-28 23:10:00;roughly a minute;three white patches forming a dim triangle (looked like one craft) flying completely silently, low, and at constant speed (fast) North. Low-flying, completely silent, three rectanglish maybe triangular white patches in night sky (not bright and shiny, but pale and somewhat luminous) formed a larger triangle shape. The point or tip pf the triangle leading north. At first we thought it was three birds. But there was no movement expect the unwavering steady fast paced movement forward. constant speed and seperation of white patches soon made it obvious it was no animal. It looked as if it was low-flying, much lower than the average plane, yet it was silent. If it was extremely high up, then it would have been extremely massive, beyond anything we know today in modern aviation. As if to prove it was no ordinary plane, a moment or two after it passed (it was moving quite fast, and I must stress again, completely silent) a regular passenger jet plane flew overhead, (with a trajectory slightly deviated from the first unidentified craft) it was very, very high but we could still hear the jets, loud and clear, the lights on the bottom of the plane twinkled and shone and blinked. There were patches of fog so this jet had headlights that illuminated the clouds in front of it. The first craft had no such headlights, nor any standard lights on the bottom at all. The white patches which formed the triangle did glow, as if emmitting heat, but where not shiny, there was no tendrils of light from them as there are from normal plane lights or even far away stars etc. IT was a subdued paleness that stood out against the night sky, faint, but there never the less. The two white patches that formed the base of the triangle were set farther back than the lights on the wings of the jet that followed soon after.;37.0011278761061;-122.05089380531
