Cylindrical object over Soquel, CA.;2010-10-09 12:00:00;Five minutes;Cylindrical object over Soquel, CA. I saw a white cylindrical object flying erratically over my area this afternoon.  Object appeared cylindrical in shape and had a diameter of say 20 feet and a length of 50 feet, like a fat tin can shape. It was white.  It had a trailing tail or tentacle-like objects dangling from it. There was a band around the middle of it. It had windows.  The object revolved about on its own axis head over tail every few seconds at a angle.  It was  about 3000 ft. up or less, and traveling from north to south over the area. I could see it clearly.  I was standing at the back of my truck watching it for five minutes. It was not flying fast at all, very leisurely.  At first I thought it was a helium balloon, but after observing it, I can say it was too large for a child's balloon, and it was turning over and over.  I went to my truck to get my camera then lost sight of it.  I do not think it was a satellite, a balloon or a plane of any kind.;37.0066;-121.9516
