I was outside my home in CA. sitting in driveway looking at stars,saw a satellite going across sky to the west. An object(triangle)w/3 lights flying just over a very thin cloud cover going the opposite way towards north. The object was fast,silent and very low. I'm the only one that saw it & it gave me chills. I watch the sky often,but this was not similar to anything I've seen before.;37.0066;-121.9516
