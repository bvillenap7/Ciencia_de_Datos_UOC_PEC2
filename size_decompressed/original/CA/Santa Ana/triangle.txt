Five dark triangles in a V formation;1999-09-15 22:50:00;twenty seconds;Five dark triangles in a V formation I was having a smoke after a late dinner. There were some clouds or a partial overcast. I could see some stars between the clouds. I saw a formation of five triangles that were dark and had no lights. They were moving paralel to Fairview Boulevard, toward the coast( I think that is south/west). They flew under the overcast, so I know that they were pretty low. I should have been able to hear some type of engine, jet or propeller noise since they were aparently low and their path was directly overhead, but they were silent. I look at the constelations from time to time and have never seen anything like this before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Unidentified Shape;2004-11-12 06:30:00;Morning;Unidentified Shape I was driving to the free 5south when a brite light caught my eye.  It was really big when I got close to it.  It was not flashing or moving.  It was right over the Santa ana zoo which was strange.  There was also a police helicopter observing it just sitting there not even moving.  They were both stoped.  I would like to know what this object was.  It was really brite. That's a strang place to be at 6:30am in the morning.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653

Blinkings lights with no structure or purpose, with little to no movement.;2011-11-05 17:01:00;2 min;Blinkings lights with no structure or purpose, with little to no movement. I looked up at the moon in the Eastern sky and saw three blinking lights in a triangle formation.  They appeared to move slightly to the North and then the were just gone.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
UFO Santa Ana California 9:25 PM PST 6/28/2014;2014-06-28 23:25:00;~5 minutes;UFO Santa Ana California 9:25 PM PST 6/28/2014 Description of craft- When it appeared over the horizon it was just a red and white blinking light.  As it peered closer, the object turned off the red and white lights, and on went blue lights.  Keep in mind that the sky was about 65% clouds so it was out of sight here and there.  As the craft came closer it had a boomerang shape, and the blue lights were on, it looked like this. (sorry I’m a very bad drawer)     http://puu.sh/9P5h6/7bf8839289.png  After it was there for less than 30 seconds, it shot off, over 1000 mph.  The craft was not as large as seen in the picture it was at the cloud line. This object was not right above me, it was about 3 miles away, but it was large. What the craft did- All they did was hover in and out of the clouds before shooting off into the distance.  It stopped after less than ten seconds of flying and lowered. It was over 2 miles away at this time.  At this time I had returned with my phone, and recorded a video of it. I cut out the time in the video when the craft had disappeared.  Shortly after the craft left for the last time I heard a faint boom, I presume a sonic boom from the craft leaving the atmosphere. Shape and Color of Craft- Triangle with blue lights Backgrounds-I myself am a straight A student, that looks at everything.  I want to know how stuff works. I love looking at the sky, with my mom’s boyfriend.  Were interested in aliens and stuff like that.  Our family is super poor, so we wished we had a 30 mm camera to snap good photos of the craft. At the moment he is a restoration worker, he fixes stuff. THIS IS THE VIDEO I TOOK AS THE CRAFT WAS GOING AWAY-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVwMgWsNdr4;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653

Thats when I noticed a weird hovering or floating black triangle shaped object in the blue sky. At this time I decided to take out my phone and film it, as I was filming it, it slowly floated down under the tree line after a couple of minutes. After that I stopped filming and went inside. About 15 minutes later I came outside to the front of my house getting ready to leave. Thats when I looked up at where I saw the object and there it was again just hovering there again, so I took my phone out again and filmed it. Minutes later it started floating down behind the tree line again. The next day I looked up in the sky again at about 12:30 pm, sure enough there it was again. I don't no what it could be, it's not a bird, it's not a plane or a drone.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
