Orange glowing egg in the sky over Orange County.;2014-02-15 01:30:00;4-6 minutes;Orange glowing egg in the sky over Orange County. February 15th, 2014. At approximately 0130, my son called me to come out and look to the north sky from the front of our home. In the distance was a small oval or egg shaped orange light.  As I watched it move slowly across the sky, it seemed to be move closer and then away from us.   This object was at a distance of 4 miles give or take and appeared to be over the city of Garden Grove or Anaheim, Ca., both these cities are directly North of my position as indicated here:  (https://www.google.com/maps/@33.XXX,-117.XXX)   My son managed to view the object through binoculars while I ran in to retrieve my telescope. Through the telescope I noticed that it was defiantly orange and egg shaped. Not to mention still moving very slowly. Far slower than an airplane and just hovering like a helicopter at one point. The orange glow was constant, but as I looked through the telescope I noticed that the object had what appeared to be windows. I was not able to see inside of the windows, but they were defiantly windows. After a few min of observing its movement it disappeared right out of the night sky. Leaving only the night sky and nothing more. The whole time it never made any audible sound at tall. Duration 4 â€“ 6 min;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
