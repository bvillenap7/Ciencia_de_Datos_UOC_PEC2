I was in my car on my way for Christmas shopping. It was early morning about 11:00 am and I looked out in the distance towards the mountains and I could see a rounded craft slowly gliding across the sky. The color was like a silvery color, but it seemed to change reddish and sort of a bluish color. It slowly glided over some freeways but it was really high up. It was clearly as high as an airplane would be. But there were mountains in the background. I kept my eye on it for sometime. Um, don't worry, I wasn't driving and looking at this thing at the same time! But I kept a close on it and in a blink, it vanished. I kept my eye out for it, but it had just vanished and never returned! ((NUFORC Note:  Source remains semi-anonymous.  PD));33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
This flaming ball was falling at an extremely fast speed from the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.  PD));2016-07-27 21:45:00;3 minutes;I was driving home around 9:30-9:45 pm. All of a sudden this flaming ball was falling at an extremely fast speed from the sky. I thought maybe a meteor or something, then it split into 2 flaming balls. They had a tail from the flames. They were headed towards an airport tower near John Wayne airport. I wondered if maybe a plane exploded and was crashing. But then when they got near the tower the flames went away and they slowed then came to a stop. I was still driving so I couldn't get a photo, then as I got around a building that blocked them they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.  PD));33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
