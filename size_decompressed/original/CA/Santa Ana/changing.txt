Bei;1999-05-08 10:12:00;20 Minutes;Time of day - 10:12am   No clouds.  No wind.  5/8/99  Santa Ana, Ca. I was on my way to the local stripmall to get an early lunch.  Being into UFOlogy myself, I tend to watch the sky...this was my first sighting. This was last Saturday...and I glanced up at the western sky, and I observed an object traveling towards me (east) at about 8000 feet.  The object was moving at a rapid pace, much like a jet. I assumed, at first, that it was a jet..but I noticed that I could observe no hard outline...it did not look like a jet.  It had my attention. The object was on a straight track with my position...and as it continued towards my position, at the very moment the object was directly over me...its STOPPED...and it did not travel in any direction for 20 minutes. Well, needless to say, when the object stopped over me...a VERY sudden deceleration..it definatly had my attention. There was no noise from this object. I could not make out the shape of the object for sure, but it was obviously metallic due to the reflection.  Suddenly the object appeared to change it's shape slightly..almost like it split in two....and the object started to ROTATE Counter-Clockwise!! I continued to watch this object, directly overhead, for a full 7 minutes...and quite frankly Peter, I got bored and went to get my lunch..I was inside for about 5 minutes and when I came out, the object was still there...only now it appeard to have split into 4 lobes...still rotating. So I continued to watch it...and after about 5 minutes the object did the most astounding thing.  It suddenly moved in a rapid figure 8 pattern, but did NOT travel in any direction, per se...it was still quite stationary, other than this manuver and it's rotation. It was at that point that I knew this had to be a real hypertechnology vehicle (ufo) and it was also at this point that I tried to get the attention of the people around me, to look at this. NOW THIS IS THE ODDEST PART OF ALL....I COULD NOT GET ANYONE TO LOOK AT THIS OBJECT!  THIS WAS A CROWDED STRIPMALL, AND YET I COULD NOT GET ANYONE TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS EVEN THERE!  NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON EVEN GLANCED IN MY DIRECTION, IT WAS JUST LIKE I WAS NOT EVEN THERE.  THEY HAD TO HEAR ME, I WAS SOMEWHAT FRANTIC, TRYING TO GET THEM TO LOOK AT THIS OBJECT, BUT I SWEAR PETER...IT WAS LIKE I WAS NOT THERE, AND THEY DID NOT REACT AT ALL TO MY WORDS. This really started to bother me...and the object continued to rotate, in place. I stood there for several more minutes. Well, at this point I went back to my office to call a friend of mine who lives a few miles down the road, to see if he could see this object..but he could not. I went back outside to see if it was still there, but it was gone, nowhere to be seen. I did not have a camera at the time...much to my disgrace. I hearby swear that the above events are true and accurate, and I KNOW this was not an ordinary object...it was not a bunch of balloons, such things could not travel that fast and suddenly stop and hover in place..for 20 minutes, it's impossible. But I have to say peter...the fact that I could not get ANYONES attention really scared me, and I wondered if there was some sort of mind control taking place here. --END.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
