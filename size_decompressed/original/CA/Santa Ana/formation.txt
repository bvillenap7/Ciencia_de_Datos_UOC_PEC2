3 circular metallic objects flying east to west in a traingular formation over central orange county, followed by another object;2006-02-24 15:08:00;4 minutes;3 circular metallic objects flying east to west in a traingular formation over central orange county, followed by another object I was taking my last work break at around 3:00 pm and I had gone up to the upper level of our parking structure, and as I stood there looking northward at the Orange County Skyline,  I saw some movement far in the Distance.  That is when I saw 3 Small, Metallic looking Circular Objects  flying in a triangular formation, Flying from East to West at a high rate of speed.  It almost looked like they were flying on a straight line from the Mountains East of the city of Orange, toward Long Beach and The Ocean. After I lost them in the Horizon to the east, I thought that was the last of it, but two minutes later, another object appeared in front of me, also moving fast on an East-West direction, as if trying to catch the other 3, except that this object seemed to bounce up and down as it flew westward. At about the time the 3 objects flew by, but before the last one passed, a helicopter happened to fly by right over my head, at a fairly high altitude, that's when I realized that I could hear the copter's engine noise, but the 3 objects did not. I can't be sure if they were man made or not, but even at the distance and altitude that they flew, they were visible enough to have seen wether they had wings or propellers, and I did not see either. If they were made by the military, all I can think is that they might have been Jet powered Drones, or they must have been testing missiles near our area. This is not the first time I've seen strange objects in the sky. Last January I also saw an object hovering over Santa Ana, And I happen to know that someone else saw that object as well.  So now every time I go out on my breaks, I am more attentive of whats above me,  and it seems to be paying off.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
Multiple White Flying Objects Appearing From Behind the Moon;2006-06-04 18:10:00;20 minutes;Multiple White Flying Objects Appearing From Behind the Moon I was outside looking at the moon with my binoculars when I saw an object appear from behind the moon.  My binoculars aren't that powerful but it looked like some type of flying object.  The object was heading Northeast.  All of a sudden more of these strange objects appeared from behing the moon and started a formation heading Northeast.  This continued for about 15 minutes and then they all dissapeared.  I believe they went higher into the sky so they were no longer visible.  Each of the objects looked the same.  They were about twice the size of a star and appeared to have lights.  At one point, my boyfriend which witnesses this as well, thought that they might be balloons.  But they were so high in the sky that I don't think that is possible.  Also because of the fact that they appeared to come from behind the moon.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
Triangle formation of lights over orange county CA.;2012-10-14 19:28:00;+2 hours;Triangle formation of lights over orange county CA On Sunday night, around 7:29 PM, my boyfriend and I entered onto the 22 east Garden Grove freeway to take a friend of ours home. At 8:06 PM, while still on that freeway, I noticed three bright lights steady in the sky up ahead of me. I pointed them out to my boyfriend, who suggested that they were planes putting on a show or perhaps may have had something to do with the space shuttle Endeavor finally reaching its destination. As I was beginning to mention that Los Angeles was in the opposite direction, the lights began, in unison, to move in a non aggressive manner and seemed to &quotsoftly tumble&quot lower in the sky. It was then that the three lights stood out as not being three individual objects (which explains my confusion behind the number of air craft I had seen), but that the three lights may actually have been part of a large triangular shaped aircraft, because as it was rolling &quotout of the sky&quot, in the same fashion as something would when tumbling or falling into water.  I could almost see the outline of the craft, an accurate way to describe the actual view of it would be as if a triangle made entirely of glass with an LED light on each corner of its shape were dropped into water.  And finally, the person watching this occur is viewing it all from outside of the water, and from a much lower level, with only the lights actually visible in the darkness. The lights then spread out to form a horizontal line and with smooth effort, picked up  speed and glided quickly away as different helicopters and airplanes came nearer to. These lights continued to show up over the next hour or so, and I did not give them much thought until after my boyfriend and I were home and nothing about the incident was mentioned on the news or anywhere online for that matter. I am filling out this report with the hopes that an explanation exists somewhere that won't be along the lines of being a natural phenomena. The three lights in formation of a triangle craft was significantly larger than average passenger or commercial airplanes, I realized, after a helicopter passed my window and made its way toward the lights. Although the lights did not &quotallow&quot for any thing in the sky to approach it, it was very obvious that if it were one craft, it was similar to comparing the size of a cat to the size of an elephant.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
