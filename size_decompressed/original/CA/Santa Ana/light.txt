Object was flickering in brightness and was moving very slowly ;1997-10-31 22:18:00;2 min.;Summary : Saw an orange, round object in the northern sky under clear conditions. Object was flickering in brightness and was moving very slowly through the air. It appeared something was falling from the bottom of the craft towards the earth. the UFO was witnessed by three other people and myself. We were standing in front of my friends place of employment when one of my friends looked up and said what the hell is that? The three of us looked up and saw what appeared to be an orange ball slowly moving across the sky. At this time, a customer came up and saw what we were looking at and said the same thing. what the hell is that. My first impression was that it was a plane that caught on fire. But by observing it more. It appeared to be moving too slowly to be an airplane. Right about this time, we all observed what appeared to be projectiles coming out from underneath the ball traveling down toward the earth. The object then started to dim in brightness and get brighter again. It did this several times. I then assumed it might be a flare but it was traveling in a straight line. the object stayed visible for about 2 or 3 minutes before it slowly faded from sight. I am an office employee that works in Santa Ana. My friends work a right down the street from me.. This is where the sighting took place at. After debating what we had seen for two hours, none of us could come up with any rational explanation of what we saw. Thank you.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
Star-like lights stationary then move slowly and then quickly, disappear.;2004-07-09 20:00:00;4 minutes;Star-like lights stationary then move slowly and then quickly, disappear. My daughter and I were in Santa Ana at 9:00 P.M. on the 9th, we saw 5 or so star-like lights in the sky (near Santa Ana but towards the mountains maybe?), some with blinking colors like red and blue, first there were 2 that were stationary in the sky, so still we thought they were stars but I realized there were no stars in this area of the sky and we watched them.  They began to move very slowly, then more quickly and others appeared -- they grew bright and then would disappear.  Shortly after this we saw a U.S. airforce jet heading for the area that we saw the lights.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653

lights over Santa Ana , CA, were about to collide when both lights disappeared in front of each other;2007-05-20 20:30:00;15 min;lights over Santa Ana , CA, were about to collide when both lights disappeared in front of each other My wife and I were sitting in lawn chairs in our back yard.  I was looking up at the sky trying to catch a  shooting star when I noticed a faint light coming from the northwest making a turn going south. Then all of a sudden the light turned off and re-appeared moments later in the same position where it originally disappeared and started to move again. That's when another light appeared even brighter heading towards the faint object,We thought they were going to collide with each other, when both stopped and flickered off, and that was it. We spent another 2-3 hours trying to locate both objects but to no luck.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
Birght light being followed by helicopter slowly.;2007-12-11 18:30:00;3 minutes;Birght light being followed by helicopter slowly My wife and I were unloading groceries, we were both facing south south east. mostly clear sky some drifting clouds winds about 15 mph coming from the east. We heard a helicopter, we both looked up and witnessed a helicopter as well as a bright light at 11:00 to the helicopter coming somewhat slowly from our right. They were both headed northeast. The helicopter sounded military not civilian (We live in a city that has has regular flyovers from police and military helicopters and the sound of the two are quite distinct) The bright lit object was silent. No sounds other than the helicopter. The pair continued on making a slight turn to the east and flew thru some clouds. the bright lit object disappeared completley while the helicopter was still visible. we then lost sight of the pair due to trees and the growing distance. The objects seemed to be about 500-750 ft up. No jets were in the sky during this event which i found unusual due to John Wany airport being so close and the fact that jets are a regular sight in the skies above my home. My wife is not a believer in thing slike this but her first words when we saw the objects were what the blank is that?;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
several objects seen over Central Orange County  (Santa Ana College Area);2009-01-26 12:15:00;30 min.;several objects seen over Central Orange County  (Santa Ana College Area) I reported something similar on 01-05-2006. This afternoon I was at lunch and about 12:15 I happened to look up and saw it again, at very high altitude this bright white object hovering for several minutes right at the top of the sky (90 degrees)  it hovered in place for about 15 minutes then suddenly it released some smaller objects, (about fifteen in total) and as they started to drop, they formed a  V formation and began to move at high speed towards northern orange county.  The original object started to move in a north-east direction.  It took fifteen to 20 minutes to slowly move about 2-3 miles in that northeasterly direction. During this time at a much higher altitude there was another object that had a very reflective surface as it would shimmer with the sunlight (it was not white like the first one, but actually reflected the sunlight).  This object was way much higher than the first one ( it was barely visible to the naked eye), and it stayed in place throughout all the time that the other object did its maneuvers. eventually after 20 minutes or so, I lost track of those two bright objects.  I am going to take my digital camera tomorrow to see if I can catch them again and see If I can take some pictures of them.  I am a county employee and I am college educated. I have studied astronomy and I can tell a star from a planet from an airplane at high altitude.  these were not planes or a mickey mouse balloon, and not seagulls either.

Red light viewed in Orange County.;2013-02-27 21:00:00;5 minutes;Red light viewed in Orange County. Was walking outside of my grandparent's house (I live next door to my grandparents) and I heard a siren.  I quickly looked around to see if anything was happening nearby.  I looked up at the sky and saw a bright, red light which seemed to be traveling upward.   At first I thought it was some sort of flare, but the light quickly became brighter and traveled in my direction.  I quickly went to get my grandmother to show her the UFO.  She briskly walked outside and looked at where I pointed, and she stood there staring with intense curiosity at the object.   At this point, the object seemed to be almost directly above us, but it seemed to be going higher and higher.   Then, wanting even more witnesses, I ran to my house to get my mother.  I excitedly told her there was a UFO outside, and she followed me back outside. The object was now farther away, more towards the south.   My mother ran inside to get a pair of binoculars, but by the time she returned, the object had almost completely faded away.  This all happened throughout the course of approximately three minutes.

Lights, dripping metal then gone in the flash of a shooting star.;2013-08-23 21:30:00;20 minutes;Lights, dripping metal then gone in the flash of a shooting star. Me and the other witness were driving home from dinner when we realized there were 4 lights, it seemed like they were seperate objects and they were not moving like any type of jet, helicopter or any craft I had ever seen.  We decided to park the car and go look at these lights which were so intriguing. We got out and walked to the end of the street, there we saw the lights, they were normal, white lights, they were stacked vertically but not in a tight way, it was slanted and it didn't look aligned. They moved from what seemed so far away to closer in what seemed like no time at all. They just sort of, hovered over.  The light became a little bit bigger and we tried to figure out what it was.  Then the other witness cried out there's something between them  I didn't understand what she meant.  I looked and the light closest to the ground was now dripping, like a hot metal or something.  It didn't seem like a beam or anything but it was kind of illuminated.   At this point the witness was hysterical and went inside and was almost begging me to.  I eventually got the witness out again, where the light looked like they had faded a little, possibly getting farther away again. Then we just observed the lights, it didn't last long, the wits was texting and took her eyes off of the lights, I saw a shooting star that was so close, we mever ever see ones this close it was amazing.  It took all of my attention away from the light for a quick second.  And that's all they needed.  I instantly looked back and they were gone.  Completely gone.  I was freaking out.  I stayed out there to make sure they didn't just fade away and come back.  They didn't.  I had never believed in UFOs or anything but I am in tears anytime I explain this story to anyone. It was so surreal and scary.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
3 extremely fast moving lights, in a delta formation, moving from N/W to S/E over southern California.;2013-09-04 09:30:00;8-10 seconds;3 extremely fast moving lights, in a delta formation, moving from N/W to S/E over southern California. My wife and I were outside in our spa.  I am an active satellite and ISS observer and am always scanning the sky for activity.  On this night, three fast moving lights in a delta formation appeared suddenly from the North West and were traveling South East at a rate of speed I've never seen before.  They appeared to be satellite-like objects in brightness and appearance (somewhere above the mesosphere) but  were less bright than the space station.  Three things caught my attention that made me think they were extraordinary #1- their formation #2- their speed, which was approximately 4-5 time faster than anything Iâ€™ve ever seen in space and #3- their trajectory was not straight.  As they streaked across the sky they made a slow turn to East and their formation slightly changed.  It remained a delta, but their proximity to each other loosened up slightly. When I first noticed them, I immediately brought my wifeâ€™s attention to it and we both observed the entire incident together, and afterward shared the same view of what we had just witnessed.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653

My dogs were barking non stop for 5min and went in the back yard to see what was bothering them, that's when I noticed a yellowish light seem to vanish when a 747 jet turned in its direction to make its approach to John Wayne airport, but it vanished in a strange way....   It seen to vanish from the left to the right as if it was being covered by something,  I was looking west as it vanished, it was stationary and was so hi it probably was just a few feet below the 747 flight path, I was approximately 2-3miles away from me..  From the looks of it, it was probably over (cross streets) Euclid and trask in the city of garden grove, we seem to see a lot of these lights in the area but this one got in the way of a plane and quickly disapeard.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653

Last night I saw this blinking light shoot up from behind this apartment building.  It then hovered for a while, then slowly moved upward.  I was so focused on the blinking light that I didnt even notice the double white light off to the right.  When the blinking light moved toward the double white light, it appeared to split into 2, then moved to the left, past the blinking light.
