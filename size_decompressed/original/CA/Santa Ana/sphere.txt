Large pulsing red/orange light that moved slowly across the sky before disappearing.;1974-04-15 22:00:00;1 minute;Large pulsing red/orange light that moved slowly across the sky before disappearing. My brother and I were camping out in sleeping bags on the front porch - I was 7 and he was 9 at the time. We looked up and at about 45 degrees up there was a single large red/orange light that sort of pulsed slowly. It appeared to be quite large and moved very slowly across the sky. We ran in to get my stepfather since we were a bit scared and as we came back out, the light was just beginning to move where we couldn't see it because of the house awning and we ran around to the side of the house where we all saw it for another few seconds before it disappeared. One one of the pulses it just stayed dark. My stepfather called to report it to the police and their response at the time was that it was probably just a weather balloon but we were unconvinced having seen it with our own eyes.

Pulsing spehre;2001-05-22 21:00:00;10 seconds;Pulsing spehre Standing on my porch smoking a cigarette. My Front proch faces north towards Los Angeles. Before I say what I saw I want to point out that I have lived in Oriange county all my life and I am very aware of what a plane looks like in the sky as well as a helicopter or any of the things you would normally see in the sky. Anyways, I was standing on my porch smoking and I happened to look up towards La and at about 30 degrees up in the sky I saw a very bright sphere pulsing a white light on and off the span between pulses was about 1/2 to 1 second.. I watched it for about ten pulses (hence my event duration) and it then it faded from sight. I got up out of my chair and walekd out onto my lawn to see if it had gone behind the trees..Nothing.. I don't know what it was but I will swear on my life that it was not a plane, helicopter or anything recognizable to me.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
Two white spheres flying over an orange county freeway;2010-01-28 08:27:00;5 seconds;Two white spheres flying over anorange county freeway While at work as a receptionist in the lobby, I was admiring the blueness of the sky, when two very quickly  moving spheres caught my eye. I work one block away from the freeway they would have been right over the freeway. They looked too spherical to be any other aircraft I know of. The UFOs were also moving with uncanny maneuverability and it was a weird m√©lange of white, and a clear metalic sheen. One was flying more erraticly with sharp quick turns as the ortherone was keeping pace but flying more smoothly. The crafts were too small to be helicopters and far too symetrical. Theydissapeared for about half second and reapeared for about 3 seconds and dissapeared compleatly. One last remark, the crafts were flying pretty low and wereclearly visible... If you happenned to be looking at the clear bluesky during those 5 seconds, I suppose.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
