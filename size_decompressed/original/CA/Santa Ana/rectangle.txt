There was a object from my point of view that was in the middle of the big dippers ladle. A bright light caught my eye in the sky looked almost as if an airplanes headlights where rectangle it then started to go further and further until it looked like a star. I shook my head as if I was saying to myself I didn't just see that then suddenly if came back shot to the left and slowly faded away as if it was going further and further away from Earth became a star and eventually disappeared. I'm a 22 year old college student that works as a technician for a wireless corporation. I'm a believer in spiritualism and peace. I've always been open to UFO's and the idea that we are no alone but never dwelled on it. I've heard some stories of people who have seen things in the sky I have never seen a UFO prior to this. I can even hear my inner thought trying to deny what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
