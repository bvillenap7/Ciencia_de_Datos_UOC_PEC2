Lighted Blimp south of Disney Land;2001-12-04 19:00:00;less than a minute;Lighted Blimp south of Disney Land While driving in Costa Mesa (Orange County), CA, at about 19:00 (7:00PM), I saw what appeared to be a lighted blimp in the northern sky.  Costa Mesa is about 10-15 miles south of Anaheim, the location of Disney Land.  It seemed to be somewhere in the air space southwest of the Disney Land Area. As I was driving, I only saw the lighted blimp for a few moments and at a distance but it appeared to be nothing else but a blimp. I submitted this report because the object could very have been reported as a UFO if it was viewed from a greater distance.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653

Stayed for over 2 minutes then flew higher so that I was unable to see them again.  They were reflecting off the sun / off and on.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
An object flew across the face of Saddleback Mountain twice, and vanished in plain sight both times.;2005-12-05 11:50:00;20 seconds;An object flew across the face of Saddleback Mountain twice, and vanished in plain sight both times. From a parking garage in Santa Ana, I saw what I thought was a small, white, private plane flying in front of the middle of Saddleback Mountain from north to south.  The plane had no wings or tail.  The distance of it was anywhere from 8 to 20 miles away.   Before the object reached the edge of the mountain, it vanished in plain sight.  It did not turn, or bank, or rise, or fall, or slip behind a ridge.  I continued watching to see if it would reappear, and a couple minutes later I saw it again.   This time it was in front of the north hump of Saddleback Mountain, flying north to south.  Before it reached the edge, it once again vanished in plain sight.   I watched for 10 more minutes, but I didn't see it again.  Both times that I saw it, I saw it for about 10 seconds before it vanished.

UFO Santa Ana ,CA 01/11/09;2009-01-11 00:00:00;1hour;UFO Santa Ana ,CA 01/11/09 On January 11,2009 I went to throw the trash when a bright object caught my attention,look like a big star in the sky but not until it moved very fast across the sky like a comet with a small glowing tail and then stopped. At this time I started yelling to my wife to come outside and then my folks woke up thinking something had happened ,when they came outside my reaction and there reaction was shock. It looked like one of the brightest star in the sky moving vary odd and very fast from one angle to another. When I called my older brother and told him I am seeing a UFO he told me I was on drugs but I just had to convince him to come see it for them self, meanwhile my folks were very nervous and exited at what they were witnessing.The object looked oval and very bright but when my brother arrived he was wordless he then immediately took his camera and we stared filming the objects they were moving so fast that it was hard for us to zoom in so we had to go on ! top of the roof were we can get a better view,we filmed it about 35min but whats weired was that when we filmed it there was two oval objects that you can clearly see in the video and they seemed to be following each other, after some attempts to call local news we saw and heard helicopters and or local helicopters. When the helicopters got close to the objects they seem to dive down and never came up again.But they showed up almost at the end of the video witch we later posted a 3min video of the UFO objects .To this day it was a unfortgatable occurrence.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653

Color-changing UFO shaped like an thin oval.;2015-10-14 20:36:00;1-2 minutes;Color-changing UFO shaped like an thin oval. It was a squished oval shape that kind of looked like a blimp but much more thinner.  It emitted a flash then changed color from blue to red to green then to red and disappeared was close and in 1 min it was farther.  Used binoculars like a flat football.  It couldn't be a blimp because there isn't a stadium, arena, amphitheater, etc.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
