2 flying disks over Santa Ana.;2008-03-14 13:40:00;10 seconds;2 flying disks over Santa Ana. I know that you will most likely not believe a 13 year old boy, but I do not lie when talking about serious stuff like this.   I was in my room, watching T.V. when I look outside of the window, and 2 UFOs flew by.  It was far away, so I can't really describe the size, but I'm pretty sure it's smaller than an airplane, and a little bit smaller than a jet.   First, it was only one, then the second one caught up in no time.  The bottom part...or body, was gray, while the top part is black.  It flew pretty fast, considering the distance.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
2 UFOs sighted flying together over Santa Ana, California and photographed.;2008-10-17 17:47:00;15minutes;2 UFOs sighted flying together over Santa Ana, California and photographed. I was sitting in watching TV when my mother in law came in and told me she wanted to show me something outside. I reluctantly followed her outside and she proceeded to try and show me two things or objects flying way up in the sky one after the other. It was difficult to see them as she told me that they weren't any sort of known aircraft. I was finally after a couple of minutes able to see them and instructed her to continue watching them as to I was going to get my camera. I ran back into our apartment and got my Canon 5D camera and switched lenses to a 70 to 200mm zoom to attempt to get a shot of them. I used the automatic settings on the camera to insure I did get some quick results if possible. Once back outside I did see them for a second time and proceeded to take a few photographs of each object. The first photograph was taken at 17:47. Neighbors of ours saw me run outside of our apartment with my camera and decided to follow me to see what was going on. They too saw the objects. Our position here in Santa Ana California was on Main St between Mac Arthur and Dyer Road just south of Alton Drive. We were facing due north looking up at about 60 degrees. The two objects flew from east to west across the sky until they disappeared. They each passed behind a high overhead cloud and then came back into view before disappearing.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
Saucer shaped aircraft levitates over witnesses and reveals it's definite shape while speeding off afterwards.;2014-07-17 12:59:00;30 minutes;Saucer shaped aircraft levitates over witnesses and reveals it's definite shape while speeding off afterwards Dawn had been breaking and I had been looking over to the horizon only to notice an aircraft roaming around.  I believed that it was a mere helicopter in patrol but it begun to elevate and move towards our general direction. The Lights emitted were Red and Blue, which did not flash simultaneously in accordance to the common pattern regular to military/Police patrol aircrafts. The red lights flashed three times and then the blue light in the center flashes along with it.  Then it changed to multiple red flashes and some minimal blue flashing. I called my neighbor over to look and we immediately pause. The Aircraft flew above us. My neighbor and I were perplexed because it was above us and it became clear to us what it is.  I would say it was a couple hundred feet or less, but then the most astonishing event occurs. The lights emitted from the aircraft revealed its definite shape, which appeared to look like a saucer with an extruded block in the center of it. The sides of the saucer had strips of red lights. Three of them exactly in both sides with one blue strip of light mixed with white in the center of the extruded block. The sound of the turbulence had affected the neighborhood dogs which caused them to bark loudly. As it sped to the other end of the street it made a sharp turn back and I immediately grabbed my ladder and I recorded the aircraft returning.  From the distance the sound of the turbulence had been very loud for the distance. Luckily I managed to record enough to approve of sighting. My witness is my neighbor and he had been surprised as well, unfortunately the focus on my camera had been lacking, explaining the difficulty in keeping range and quality. I apologize if the video had been shaking around, I was nervous about the situation and I was not sure how to adapt to it. I then called the hotline and I had been advised to write a report as shown, and to attach a video along with it.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653

Strange UFO object sighted during a drive late at night;2020-07-02 23:30:00;4 minutes x 2;Strange UFO object sighted during a drive late at night I was driving on the freeway in the dark at 11:30 pm and had been thinking about how my dad saw a UFO and realized I believed him and then I was begging to see one in my mind and had done some siri searches on my long hour drive to my boyfriends as well last night about aliens and UFOs.  Then a strange flashing object lit up in the left of the sky very far away.  It was flashing red and then blue.  It was shaped like a circus tent array of lights or sort of like a spider shape.  It finally stayed red and started moving closer to the middle of the sky and closer to my car.  I was still driving at this time.  Then I was directly under it and I passed it.  It was gone and I called my parents to tell them.  During my phone call with my dad, it appeared again far to the left behind buildings and trees.  It moved towards the middle of the sky in front of me about a few thousand years ((sic.  yards)) up and then it started going back to the left again and slowly inclining higher into the sky towards the moon.  That was when I saw three horizontal blue lights in the middle and a black disc within the array of red lights.  I knew it was not a plane because it was going very random directions and it appeared twice and was following me.  It was like they heard me ask them to show up and then they showed up for real!  I have never seen one in my life until last night.  I was on the I-405 south.;33.752815878745;-117.857598628653
