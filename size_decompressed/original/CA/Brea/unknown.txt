I was an BSA Merit Badge Counsilar at the time and was helping 5 young Scouts learn the names of various consellations.  Suddenly, what appeared to be a light about the same size of a bright star started moving in a South to North path and then stopped moving almost directly overhead.  Then, several minutes later that same bright light started moving again at a 90 degree angle to its first movement directly to the West. ((NUFORC Note:  Date probably is approximate.
