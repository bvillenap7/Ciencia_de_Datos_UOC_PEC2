CIRCULAR DISK OVER BREA IN ORANGE COUNTY;2001-05-13 02:45:00;1 minute;CIRCULAR DISK OVER BREA IN ORANGE COUNTY A PERFECTLY ROUND OBJECT WAS FLYING NORTH/EAST.  IT WAS MOVING FASTER THAN ANY AIRCRAFT  I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE.  THE OBJECT FLEW PAST US AND HEADED TOWARD MT. BALDY MOUNTAIN.  WE WERE NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS BUT THEN, THE OBJECT STOPPED DEAD, MOVED DOWN (SOUTH) AT A LEFT ANGLE, THEN DOWN A RIGHT ANGLE, AND THEN SHOT UP TOWARDS THE NORTH EAST AGAIN.  IT DID ALL OF THESE MOVES WITHIN A 15-20 TIME SPAN.  THEN WE KNEW THIS COULD NOT BE ANY TYPE OF PLANE, JET OR HELICOPTER.  ALL FOUR OF US SAW THIS AT THE SAME TIME.;33.9337647822061;-117.884808619091
