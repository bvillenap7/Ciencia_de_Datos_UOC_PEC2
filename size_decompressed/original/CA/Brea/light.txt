A light emitted other other lights;1977-08-15 02:00:00;25 seconds;A light emitted other other lights This is another strange thing I have seen in the night sky as an amateur astronomer.  I was out with my telescope around two in the morning and about ready to call it a night when I noticed a star directly overhead.  It was not especially bright but I knew that it did not belong in that constellation of stars.  As I looked at the constellation and was telling myself that it didn't belong, it grew brighter and brighter.  It did not move at all it just got brighter.  It came to a point when it was brighter than any other star in the sky, which made me think I was about to get nailed in the face by a meteor. You know what they say if it ain't moving, it's coming straight for you.  So, you're saying to yourself, big deal! That's around the time of the Persied (maybe Leonid, I forget) meteor shower. I know that and I know what meteors look like.  Well, the best part was that , as I watched for the impact, the light sent out about 5 or 6 dimmer lights in quick succession, one at a time, in separate directions.  In fact, it seemed as if they shot out in a perfectly geometrical design.  The little lights moved off in straight lines then the central light that first drew my attention started going dim.  It grew dimmer and dimmer until I could no longer make it out.  It never moved laterally.  I figure something came into the atmosphere straight down over me, let smaller craft loose, then went vertically back out of the atmosphere. I've seen meteors that fragment but they never break up symetrically. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of two excellent reports submitted by same witness, who appears to us to be an excellent witness.  Both reports from Brea, CA, during 1977.  PD));33.9337647822061;-117.884808619091
Unbelievable speed;2008-02-20 08:00:00;1 minute;On the night of the lunar eclipse my dad called me out to witness his last full lunar eclipse in his lifetime.  As we watched I  saw a red light dart upwards toward the moon.   I  instantly started to follow the light.  I  moved up the street to re aquire the light due to trees in the way.  I  watched it speed towards the west then north at an unbelievable speed.  I asked my dad to look  at that light but he was fixated on the eclipse.  He said it was probably just an airplane.  Then I pointed out an airplane and how slow it was moving and he admitted that what we saw was moving way to fast to be a jet or an airplane.  I thought it might be the missile fired at tha satellite but that was earlier in the day. we saw something very very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  The lunar eclipse occurred on Wednesday, February 20, 2008.  We have inserted that data above.  PD));33.9337647822061;-117.884808619091
Star-like abject moving randomly across the sky.;2011-02-11 15:00:00;1 hour;Star-like abject moving randomly across the sky. This afternoon, my wife and I witnessed  a small, star-like object moving across the sky.  We observed it for over thirty minutes and in that time, it randomly changed directions and speed.  It also stayed in one place for over ten minutes.   It shined brightly at times, then became faint and even disappeared at times.  At its fastest speed, it was comparable to a shooting star, (but never burned out). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
