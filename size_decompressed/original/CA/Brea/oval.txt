The object hovered for about an hour and a half over the City of Anaheim;2009-03-01 14:00:00;1 hour;The object hovered for about an hour and a half over the City of Anaheim I was sitting on my (third floor) patio in Brea California on Sunday, 2/01/2009 afternoon (about 1400 hrs), looking south toward John Wayne Airport.  I noticed a small dark object, stationary unlike a bird or plane.  I watched it for a few minutes to see whether or not it was a plane, helicopter, bird, etc.  It had none of these obvious characteristics.  It just hovered.  It was difficult to determine exactly how far away it was, but I would guess between 2 and 5 miles, based on the geography of the hills. When I saw the object rise, I would guesstimate a few hundred feet, I alerted my friend Phil.  He immediately wrote it off as a bird or plane. I told him to keep watching it, it was stationary and would move slowly up and down, then horizontally some distance.  We measured the movement and it’s position by the distance between the telephone poles that are about 3 to 4 blocks away. We continued watching it for about ½ hour as planes flew by it and we then realized it was not an aircraft, plane or helicopter.  My next-door neighbor Elli had stepped out of her front door when I pointed it out to her. She was as mystified as we were. The only explanation I had is that it might have been a kite.  The only problem with that explanation was there was little or no wind, plus the altitude of this object was at least 1000 to 1200 ft high and it would not swing from side to side as a kite would naturally do. After about one and a half hours, the object seemed to drift in a south west dierection out of sight.
