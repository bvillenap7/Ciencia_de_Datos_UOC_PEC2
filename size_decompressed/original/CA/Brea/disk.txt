Silver craft followed by an odd flash;2002-09-16 14:45:00;A few seconds;Silver craft followed by an odd flash I was on my way to work traveling on the 57fwy just thru the Brea Canyon when I noticed a small silver disk shape craft hovering about 1000 ft up. Not even 3 seconds passed when the craft just shot off... Later that evening I notices a strange white flash in the general area of the earlier sighting...this wasnt lighting, it was more localized in a small area in the sky. Also I couldnt help notice that there was an odd number of aircraft in that area...5 of the aircraft seem to be lined up in a search pattern...;33.9337647822061;-117.884808619091
