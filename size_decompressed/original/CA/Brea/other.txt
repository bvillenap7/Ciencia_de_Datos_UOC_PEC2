I looked up and saw a slow moving craft appox. 1-200-ft. above and to the west of our car! I was appox. 16yrs old when I saw this craft. I am now 43 yrs old and can see this in my mind as clearly as it happen only 5 mins ago! also a day never goes by without me remembering the event. we were coming back from a camping trip at crystal lake. as i stated eariler i was in the back of our family station wagon ehen i looked up and saw what looked like to be a giant bird flying  appox 1-200 ft. up and to the west of our car, just below the top of the mountains and seem to be go the same speed and dirrection as us. what really gets me and why i am finnaly telling someone about this is, i have heard David Davenport on Art Bells show now several times, and never heard any discription like what i saw. this was now what i call bird of brey shapethe color of this thing was dull green. what it reminded me of in regards to color was that of copper when it tarnishes. the shape was very close to that of the bird of prey seen on star trek! I know this was a long time ago and I hope I dont sound crazy, but I got to know now if anyone else has ever seen anything shaped like this?;33.9337647822061;-117.884808619091
A small, very bright object was seen racing across the sky at extreme altitude and speed.;2013-12-11 16:45:00;2-3 minutes;A small, very bright object was seen racing across the sky at extreme altitude and speed. The very bright/shiny object was observed in the sky North of Brea, California. Brea is located in the Northeast corner of Orange County.  At the time the observation was made, the object was traveling very fast and at a very high altitude (possibly the fringe of space) in a West/North/West direction.  When first sight the object appeared to be at about 70 degrees above horizontal (from the base of the Brea foothills) traveling from East to West.  The Object approached the brightness of Venus when seen in the night sky, but was much smaller.  There was no sound associated with the observation.  No lights were seen.  As the object moved quickly across the sky it was followed by a very small and visible white trail, however, it was nothing like any vapor trail previously observed on other occasions associated with high altitude military aircraft or the vapor trails of rockets.  The object never left a trail as it moved.  The trail follow the object, never increasing in length or width and immediately appeared to dissipate (it's size remaining constant.)  At least one commercial airliner was seen in the sky at the same time as the object's sighting, also traveling East to West at an altitude consistent with an airport approach for landing.  The airliner appeared to be motionless in the sky when compared to the object.;33.9337647822061;-117.884808619091
