Two very bright-white large lights on either side, and a blinking white light on the back tail, but it didn't look like a tail.   My phone wasn't handy, so I did not take a photo.  It had a distinct diamond shaped outline.   It went directly over our house, slowly, flying in from the north, headed south.  I have never seen a plane on this flight path. They always run west to east, or east to west.  I found this link online.  This is very close to what I saw: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/10/diamond-shaped-ufo-california_n_1415261.html ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
