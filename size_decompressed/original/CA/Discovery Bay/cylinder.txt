Three objects, three cylinders each, and huge bright lights.;2018-06-27 12:08:00;4 minutes;Three objects, three cylinders each, and huge bright lights. I came out on my deck, sat down, and looked up, and there were 3 very large, bright white lights coming in my direction. They were not any kind of planes that I had seen, so I watched for a minute, grabbed my iPhone and took 3 pictures. The closer they came, there was no sound, complete quiet. Once they passed, I looked at the pictures.  There were 3, and as I enlarged the picture, it showed 3 cylinders per object. The more I zoomed in, they were very distinctive 3 cylinders per object.  One seemed to glow red in the middle cylinder. I would send pictures if I knew how to down load to my PC. Will never forget this one, and I have proof!;37.8989;-121.6054
