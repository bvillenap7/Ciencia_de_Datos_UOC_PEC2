It was a white light(the hue of incandescent lamps) and some sort of red light. Just as I opened the door to check them out, one headed toward Stockton, CA. and just disappeared.  The other kept moving a bit and that too disappeared.  There was absolutely no sound like that of an aircraft.  I did not have enough tiem to snap a pic with my phone. At the time, it was partially cloudy but I have not seen anything even after I rushed out to look.;37.8989;-121.6054
