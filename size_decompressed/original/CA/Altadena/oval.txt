However, I would find it difficult to explain what I saw this evening as an April fools joke.  I am a professional engineer & must state that I have seen nothing like this in my 35+ years as a professional. What I saw tonite were two distinct & separate formations very high in the atmosphere heading SSE from between Venus & Jupiter @ ~19:50 PDT.  I watched them for about 8 minutes, after which they disappeared.  Though they were somewhat dim, and @ a high altitude, I was able to follow them.   Their brightness reminded me of the 7 sisters though somewhat dimmer & they continued forward.  That said, they were clear to my eye & I was able to track them until they disappeared @ ~220 degrees (SSW). This is the 1st report I have ever made to anyone on such topic.  I am not into UFO's, but I know what I saw tonite.  Let me know if you require more info. & please let me know, if you may, what you determine re: this report.;34.1931000000001;-118.1383
