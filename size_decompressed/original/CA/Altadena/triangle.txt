Stationary Black Triangle over Southern California Near JPL, spotted by 2 witnesses. 20-30 seconds.;2003-08-11 13:47:00;25-30 sec;Stationary Black Triangle over Southern California Near JPL, spotted by 2 witnesses. 20-30 seconds. My friend and I after running some errands got out of my car he looked up and said he saw something strange. I thought he was teasing at first then when he kept looking I began looking through the high clouds bright sunlight and he had to direct me to what he saw just North west of the suns position. He joked that it was either and Object or a black trash bag floating around. I saw for a few seconds a black triangle, same distance up as the high clouds, it was not obscured at first and did not appear to be moving at all. Within a few seconds it was gone, either vanished or was obscured by clouds. This is my third sighting, only my first report. It is possible it was a highflying balloon(unlikely because of not moving) or a test craft designed by Northrup Grummann JPL is less than 250 yards from my front door. It is also possible it was something else- of non-terrestrial origin, There was no propeller or exhaust visible at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a medical professional.
