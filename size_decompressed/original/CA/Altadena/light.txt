The woman asked me if I thought it was a satellite and I said that I thought so, except it was moving too quickly.  The light stopped almost directly over our heads.  We both were surprised and she commented that she had never seen a satellite do that before.  We watched it for a moment longer and then - poof- it just disappeared.

They all were maintaining the same speed and direction one appearing after the next. My friend and I both watched this transpire over about an hour. When looking up above us,we also noted additional distant lights but traveling in several different directions.;34.1931000000001;-118.1383
