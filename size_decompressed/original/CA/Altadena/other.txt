A series of bright orange lights appeared in a line, floated up and disappeared near Pasadena, CA. ((NUFORC Note:  Parachutists??  PD));2018-11-20 20:15:00;10 minutes;A series of bright orange lights appeared in a line, floated up and disappeared near Pasadena, CA Approximately 15-20 orange lights floated up into the sky in a line and then each disappeared in the same order, at their highest point seen.  We are in Altadena, CA, and the lights appeared to the south or southwest and seemed to float up and towards the north or northwest. We have been unable to find anything about this on the Internet.  The lights could have been part of a holiday display or event but i would think others would also be curious.  It is hard to tell how far away they were, possibly at the Rose Bowl or farther south such as LAX?  Any info would be appreciated!;34.1931000000001;-118.1383
