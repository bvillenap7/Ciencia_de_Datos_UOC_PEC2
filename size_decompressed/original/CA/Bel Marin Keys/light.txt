Slow-moving horizontal round white light;2000-09-27 05:30:00;5 seconds;Slow-moving horizontal round white light I was out jogging  at 5:30 a.m. This is my routine most every early morning.  It was still dark, some fog, and no wind.  As I was approaching an intersection of homes, across the very wide avenue running perpendicular to my approach are other homes and some trees.  From my vision's right side, a bright semi/incandescent blue/white round light floated in a straight line above the roof tops to the left and disappeared beyond and behind roofs and some small trees.  The altitude seemed to be about 200 feet off the ground.  The light, held out at arms length seemed to be about the size of a nickel.  The intensity was not blinding, and clearly the object was round. The travel-speed was not anything like a meteor, as this object was in no hurry.  There was absolutely no sound from this light. After reviewing your other reports, the similar (identical in description) one is the 7/11, Salem, Oregon report you have listed as slow moving horizontal...
