Bright balls of light hovering in the sky over Oceanside, CA.;2014-08-25 21:38:00;12 minutes;Bright balls of light hovering in the sky over Oceanside, CA. I was on the south side of the city returning from a class and I noticed two large objects in the sky, my first thought was helicopters because the seem to be staying in one place, my home is about 4 miles from where I first saw the lights there were two large clusters of yellow light, then it changed and there were four for a minute I thought they were street lights but they were to high and to yellow.   I watched them my entire trip when I got to my house they seem much closer to the ground and it appeared to be two objects I went in to get my partner who is a retired nuclear physicist and my binoculars.  I could see what appeared to be smoke rolling of of the top of one of the objects then is just disappeared.   Looking through the binoculars the other object appeared to be two very large circular shapes almost on top of each other, in the back round I could see faint light in the clouds of the other object.  The circular object that was still in the sky appeared to have lights all around it and a smaller circular object in the middle with lights around it as well then it started to fade and disappeared.  When I was on the south side of town the objects were very high in the sky but on the north side of town they appeared lower still the view with binoculars was more defined that what I saw just looking with my eyes.   My partner was astounded and could not find an explanation as to what we were seeing. I took photos with my iphone and the objects just appeared to be small balls of light that were very far away.   After they were gone you could see the smoke through the binoculars behind the clouds and faint red balls in the sky.  I have three photos.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
Changing Sphere Multi Color Hovwering for weeks.;2015-09-28 23:00:00;ongoing;Changing Sphere Multi Color Hovwering for weeks Since 9-28, every night from 10pm until 2am or so, a multi colored glowing sphere has been seen in East County San Diego.  I have seen it from my backyard in Oceanside looking East toward Escondido.  The colors are brilliant, green, blue, very bright orange, red and white.  It moves slightly south then up slightly and hovers for hours before disappearing.  Mostly it stays sphere shape but seem to flatten itself out to almost a line of lights. Sometimes it flickers a blue orbish light on the top.  My neighbors and friends have all seen it. Some think it may be the space station or a satellite.  Sometimes it turns blue and splits into two.  During the third week in Sept, the first night we saw it, two planes came from Camp Pendelton to investigate.  They circled around and flew back to base,  It's still there tonight.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
