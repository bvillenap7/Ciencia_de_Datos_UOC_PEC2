Glowing Orange Ball In Sky, Maneuvering Capabilities, Have Photos witnessed by 4 people;2007-12-03 20:50:00;20 Minutes;Glowing Orange Ball In Sky, Maneuvering Capabilities, Have Photos witnessed by 4 people I was out walking my dog in my neighborhood. I was coming back home and noticed a bright orange star to the northeast. It was far away with other stars but I thought it curious and I wondered if there ere any other orange stars in the sky. I panned from the orange star in the sky to the left looking down my street. To my absolute astonishment there was a glowing orange ball approximately 100 yards above my neighbor’s home just sitting there idle. I thought to myself there is no way I'm seeing this so I rubbed my eyes and did a double take but the object was still there. It was a glowing bright orange ball just hovering over our neighborhood. When I realized that it wasn’t a figment of my imagination I started running down the street dragging my dogs behind me. I have 2 bull dogs and one of them is older and doesn’t run very fast. After trying to drag her I finally just threw her leash away and left her in the street while I ran home. My father and daughter were both home and I yelled in the house “you’re not going to believe this but there is a UFO outside.” Both of them came into the back yard and witnessed it. While I was running home it moved slowly from above my neighbor’s house across the street to the east over our back yards.  We sat there looking at it in awe. It looked kind of like a party balloon as it was circular, but it was glowing orange. So bright in fact that you could see the light from it emanating off the neighboring rooftops. After it hovered over out back yard for about 5 minutes it then started moving south. I new I had to tell more people so I ran over to my neighbors, knocked on their door, the wife answered and I told her she had to come out side and see this UFO. It was starting to get further away moving slowly thought the sky but we both sat there and watched it move southward stopping periodically and hovering for 5 or 10 minutes and then continuing on to the south. This happened in Oceanside California near the intersection of Lake and Ridge. What was reall! y amazin g is that it just hovered over my neighbor’s house and then moved eastward. Stopped, hovered again and then moved southward stopping periodically and just hovering. There was no wind out and the light was so bright that it could not have been a balloon with a light inside or on fire because it was visible from at least a mile as it continued southward down Melrose Ave towards the city of Carlsbad. We did get 2 pictures of it and there has to be more people that saw it. It was not necessarily a craft but it was able to maneuver and shone so bright that as it passed the neighboring homes the rooftops glowed orange.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
Reddish circular UFO cruising south west in San Diego County.;2012-11-09 03:13:00;15-20 seconds;Redish circular UFO cruising south west in San Diego County Hi! I thought what I just saw was rather interesting and was worth a google search to notify the appropriate people. I couldn't sleep and was out back having a cigarette- looking up at the stars (pretty clear for the most part with a few clouds north east of where I'm located. Next thing you know coming from the north heading south (almost bee lining it to the coast) I saw a circle with a ring above. The ring was very defiant and visible.  It lasted long enough for me to blink, blink again and it was still just cruising heading southwest.   I travel frequently and this thing was cruising in the same view as you would an ascending or decsending airplane.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077

3 Round shaped white and bright lights.;2014-06-18 23:00:00;1 hour;3 Round shaped white and bright lights. June 19, 2014 Dear Mr. Davenport,   Have you heard about the reported lights in the sky last night?  This was widely reported and video taped in Southern California, beginning near Camp Pendleton Marine Base by Oceanside, and continuing over Orange County, (for your reference, near the coast/Disneyland area), and then going north to and over the City of Riverside.  I did not personally see these lights, but they reported on the lights and showed the video tape on every station in Los Angeles, Ca, that reaches the counties named above. The Marine Base and NASA states, there were no military aircraft in the area during the sighting of these lights.  The sheriff’s offices in San Diego County, Orange County, and Riverside County were contacted by several people who viewed these lights. I hope that you will look into this report.  You can view these lights and the report by going on the websites of any of our local stations, ABC Channel 7, NBC, Channel 4, CBS, Channel 2, all Los Angeles stations. Thank you;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
Red/Orange lights in the sky.;2014-10-29 19:18:00;5 minutes;Red/Orange lights in the sky Last night my friend and I were on the beach in Oceanside, California.  It was 7:18pm and there was no one else on the beach but us.  All of a sudden in the sky appeared approximately seven objects that were red and orange in color.  They were placed the same exact distance apart from one another, almost forming a triangular shape.  At first it seemed to be standing still in the sky, it made no noise at all.  It seemed to slowly drift or fade and then all of a sudden it was gone.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
Yellowish orangish light approached as a plane. Then the obj. stopped, turned white.((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:15:00;4 minutes;A yellowish orangish light approached as a plane.  Then the object stopped straight above and turned bright white as a helicopter spolight.  Then the light epexpanded out in all directions until it was 100 times as big bright and white like a helicopter spotlight in the fog.  Then it turned towards the west and the white light turned with it like a flashlight would if you rotated it.  Then it jetted off leaving a white glow and a commet tail flair of glowing teal colored light.  The teal light condensed and just hovered long after the object was gone.  There was no sound ever.

Circular floating metalic ball over Oceanside, CA.;2017-01-29 14:10:00;45 seconds;Circular floating metalic ball over Oceanside, CA. Noticed a metallic looking object floating in the sky, heading east from west, clear blue sky, little bit of wind, maybe 1000 feet high guesstimate, maybe 10 feet wide guesstimate.  No sound or fumes.  It could be a Mylar Balloon floating but not sure, and don't think so, so took a couple of pics.  Object drifted behind the big tree, then never reappeared. Strange. My wife and I have also seen many lights in the night sky over the past month.  Some are a brilliant flash of light, size of a distant star.  Some flash 3 times and then disappear. This is all happening over southern California, near Marine base, Camp Pendelton, Oceanside.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077

It wasn't moving . It was an orange/yellow color which we figured was probably a reflection from the sun setting. I live near the beach . We got the binoculars and we were all able to see it clearly...there was a distinct hole in the middle. The inversion layer clouds were starting to roll in ..so after about 5 minutes of clear view with and without the binoculars, it wasn't able to be seen.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
