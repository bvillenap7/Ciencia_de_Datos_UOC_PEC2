Red lights move slowly and vanish within seconds.;2014-08-14 20:27:00;5 minutes;Red lights move slowly and vanish within seconds My wife and I were driving west on Oceanside Blvd.  She looked south and said, Oh my gosh, there are six red lights hovering really low in they sky  As I looked up I could see all six red lights, not one of the lights were blinking like most aircraft in the sky.  They were all far too close togther to be helicopters or airplanes, about 100 feet off the ground and almost as if they were in a rectangular formation.   We live close to the Marine base and I've seen helicopters in formation many times before, never do they fly in a porportionate rectangular formation.  Also, you can hear helicopters/airplanes flying, there was no sound. We made a left driving toward the lights. The two lights at the top of the formation began to move up toward the sky very slowly. We pulled into our garage and came running out with our camera phones ready, the lights were gone. In the literal 5 seconds it took to get back outside to see the lights they had completely vanished. We were astonished and left to wonder, what type of red lights could have been stagnant in the sky and just completely vanish within seconds?;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
