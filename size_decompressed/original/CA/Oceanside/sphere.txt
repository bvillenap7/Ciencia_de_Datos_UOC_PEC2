Bright colored sphere shape in the Western sky;2008-03-20 00:00:00;30 mins;Bright colored sphere shape in the Western sky While smoking a cigarette on my patio facing west towards the ocean I glanced into the night sky and happened to notice, it was very clear visibilty and as I looked over the horizon I saw what appeared to be a flashing star, it changed color from bright reds to blues in a spectrum. I thought that maybe it was a plane but it didn't move but stayed floating in the sky positioned in the same spot. It appeared to be several hundreds of feet away after making my assumptions as what it was I then ran in my home and alerted my wife to view what I had saw. She returned outside with me and was amazed! She then ran inside to awake my daughter who returned with her to witness this object. I had grabbed my camera in the midst of all that had gone on and used my 75X300 lens to capture the object and I have pictures.I also used my video camera and captured it as well. What was this I wonder and if anyone know please contact me back. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
