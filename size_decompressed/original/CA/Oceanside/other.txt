A space shuttle like craft;1993-06-01 20:00:00;1 minute;A space shuttle like craft I lived on a dead end street and at the end of the street is a white waist high fence, and on the other side is a man mad drop of made of concrete and flowers, and at the bottom is a street. On my street are apartments on both sides kinda like an ally. The street is about 30 to 50 feet wide, and the apartments are two story. ok, now what happen was i walked out of my house down the stairs and onto the street. I then made a right turn and began to walk to my friends house, the next apartment over up stairs - same building,and as I began to turn right and walk up his stairs something caught my eye to the right of me. I stopped to look at it, and it looked like a space shuttle maybe around 100 to 200 hundred feet... maybe up in the sky right smack dab in between the apartments. It wasn't making any sound, it was moving towards me at about maybe 5 mph and had a grey glow, but not light, just bright grey color, and not from the street lights... my street doesn't have any, just building lights. I think i must have walked under it as i walked out of my house and onto the street, it was very close!!! I then ran up my friends stairs and pounded on his door, it took him what felt like forever to answer, but when he did i got him and his brother to come outside to look... but it was gone. All we could see was blinking lights off in the distance from plains like you do any other night. I don't know what i saw, I really wish I knew. I live next to a military base, so maybe they have something to do with it... I don't know. It sounds funny... a space shuttle looking craft, but thats what I saw.

What appeared to be a slow-burning, orange-colored object was slowly floating in a northernly direction directly over the beach just ;1997-05-02 22:00:00;10 minutes;Summary : What appeared to be a slow-burning, orange-colored object was slowly floating in a northernly direction directly over the beach just south of the city boat harbor. Six of us noticed it from a balcony at a party. I am a working daily journalist. With me were two Oceanside city council members. This object floated north for about two or three minutes, then stopped. After about a minute or so, it began moving back south-southwest over the water. Altitude was hard to determine, but it appeared to be climbing, albeit ever-so slowly. At one point, a small spark like object slowly fell from the main object. Through biconculars I was able to see four (4) distinct lights in a diamond shape. This object slowly faded from sight directly above our city's Pier. I honestly thought it was a balloon someone had set afire and let drift, but it wouldn't have burned that long and, because of our off-shore breeze, which was slight that night blowing inland, no balloon would have drifted p!arallel against the wind, then reverse course. Yes, we were at a party. No, no one was drunk. In fact, at least two of the people had nothing to drink. One object.Orange (as in fire) in color.At first appeared to be burning.Binocs revealed four (4) distinct lights.Object floated slowly at about a speed of 20 to 40 knots in a northernly direction over the California coastline near the city harbor of Oceanside.Speed was tough to determine because altitude appeared to be at about 500 to 600 feet. But the longer watched, the more it seemed to be gaining in altitude.Altitude: 500 to 600 feet.A second object drifted off to the southeast for about what seemed to be a short distance, as if it were a spark falling away, but then it seemed to hover in mid-air.Observers:1.

This object had a bright orange light that was steady and not moving;2012-12-24 20:30:00;1 minute;This object had a bright orange light that was steady and not moving I got out of my auto in the driveway and saw above my garage to the north east a large bright  orange globe at an altitude of about ten thousand feet in the dark sky. The size of the object appeared to be dime sized at that altitude.  It was not moving I went in and got my wife but it was gone perhaps covered up by low clouds it did not appear again.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
Silent group of lights moving  overhead.  Hovered briefly then reversed course and disappeared.;2013-04-20 20:30:00;10 seconds;Silent group of lights moving  overhead.  Hovered briefly then reversed course and disappeared. Walked outside my house just after dusk and noticed a silent group of lights traveling overhead from east to west.  There were four lights in what seemed to be a upright square shape (2 white, 1 blue, and 1 red). Very bright colors that were quite beautiful. I think this is what attracted my eyes to the object. I had the impression that the object was quite close.  It appeared to be 30-50 feet in altitude and 100-200 yards away. It also seemed to be quite small.  Perhaps the size of a small cellphone held at armâ€™s length.  After a few seconds, the object stopped and hovered briefly then reversed course quickly back to the east and disappeared behind a row of homes in our subdivision. I went back in the house to the upstairs bedroom to see if I could spot the object but it was gone.   What I found interesting was the complete silence of the object and how smoothly it moved through air. Weather conditions were clear, no clouds or wind with an ambient temperature of! ~60 degrees. It was definitely not an aircraft.  A helicopter could have performed similar maneuvers but it was completely silent. The only thing that I can imagine it was would be some sort of remote control drone, but a completely silent one. Our home is quite close to a local municipal airport so I am familiar with the aircraft that land there. This was something completely different.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
Seven small orange orbs seen floating in night sky less than one mile from Camp Pendleton, California.;2014-06-26 21:30:00;10 minutes;Seven small orange orbs seen floating in night sky less than one mile from Camp Pendleton, California. We were outside on deck a talking when I saw a small orange light floating up above the person I was speaking to.  First just one light as it descended into the clouds another began to rise up, soon there were 6 small orange lights following one another. All appeared to be drifting along as if following the coastline then they too began to float upward, one by one disappearing into the low bank of clouds.  We are about one minute from the entrance to Camp Pendleton army base. After these small orbs descended into clouds a very quiet helicopter flew overhead four time, making a five mile radius circle around the area but flying each time flying directly over our heads before flying off south in the direction where the orbs came from. I am a female artist visiting Calif. and the other person is a male Electrician doing electrical work on new construction for the military on Camp Pendleton itself.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
