Brilliant flare like object into black craft with red light;2011-03-09 06:20:00;5 minutes;Brilliant flare like object into black craft with red light From the 7-11 near back gate, Redondo/Vandegrift.  Saw what looked to be a signal flare, walked past a light pole and it turned into a black object with many red lights.  It traveled north to north west toward Camp Pendleton.   Walking toward the north on the street,  a helicopter went to the same airspace as the black object, the sound of the helicopter was very prominent, as compared to the silent black object.   The lights on the black object would blink 1 at a time in succession from the direction it was going, in 3 flashes. Background: former US Army soldier FDC specialist.  Currently student at college.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
Six orange orbs in the sky near Oceanside, CA.;2014-07-26 22:00:00;10 minutes;Six orange orbs in the sky near Oceanside. On 7-26-14, my son and I were coming home from an outing.  It was around 10:00 PM.   As we were coming down our road  we noticed in the sky 4 orange colored floating orbs  grouped in twos.  They were fairly close to each other.  They looked as though they were barely moving. They were not at all like airplanes.  There were no flashing lights.  It was almost as if they were drifting very slowly in the sky.  Within a few minutes we noticed two more of them come up on the right side like they were trying to catch up.   After they were all together they started to fade out one by one until they all disappeared. These orbs were seen out above the ocean near Oceanside.  I would say the sky was somewhat cloudy but the orbs were very visible . It was something we had never seen before so we had to pull off to the side of the road so we could take it all in.   We wondered if anyone else had witnessed this as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
I create art outside my backyard and I use a slow motion camera with dance. I caught the 2 oval black crafts + 1 white still one.;2020-07-17 19:30:00;1 second;I create art outside my backyard and I use a slow motion camera with dance. I caught the 2 oval black crafts + 1 white still one. This was the 3rd day in a row. The 1st was a white circle that didn’t move. The 2nd was like this one - black and oval.  It moved quickly and vanished. The 3rd day is this one - it came closest. And if it wasn’t for a slow motion camera capturing my art I wouldn’t have witnessed it. It flies by quickly but the shape is oval black just like the day before.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
