Silver metallic object seen hovering high above suburban intersection in late afternoon sky, might be two objects.;2006-10-03 17:25:00;1 or 2 minutes;Silver metallic object seen hovering high above suburban intersection in late afternoon sky, might be two objects. While riding in the back seat of 2003 Hyundai Tiburon, my friends and I stopped at a light at the cross streets of College and Towne Center, heading Southbound. I leaned my head back to look at the sky, bored, while we were waiting for the light to change. The sky was clear blue, but my eyes immediately fixed onto an object. It was very high in the sky. I couldn't make out a shape, but it was reflecting light. It appeared stationary in the sky. I tried to determine if there was any movement at all. The light turned green and we rolled forward to the next cross street, Frazee Road. The light was green there so we rolled right on through. I never looked away. I could tell where we were because the road goes uphill from there and turns slightly to the left. I removed my ballcap and tried to keep an eye on the object. I didn't say anything to my friends because at this point, I was believing this to be one of those food store balloons you usually see at the register. I thought maybe a kid had lost one. Then I saw the object appear to reflect light in two spots, like maybe there was not one but two objects. Still, I thought, maybe they were two balloons tied together. The strange thing was, I couldn't really tell if the object drifted any. I wasn't in the best circumstance for viewing them, I realize, and they may have been just balloons, maybe even a weather balloon, but the thing that seemed off to me was that they did seem perfectly still in the sky. *shrugs* Posting it here just in case it was something more and someone else got a better view of it.;33.2105620192308;-117.321183173077
