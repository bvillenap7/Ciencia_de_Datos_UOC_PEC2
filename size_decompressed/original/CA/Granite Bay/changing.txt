Strange color and shape changing light over Northern California;2010-05-30 02:30:00;10 Minutes;Strange color and shape changing light over Northern California At around 2:30 AM on May 30th, myself, as well as a number of friends and neighbors (roughly 30 in total), witnessed an object in the sky that we all believe to have been a UFO.  The object was first noticed toward the right hand portion of the sky, and at the time, didn't seem much higher than around a few hundred feet up (judging by the speed it was traveling, and the movements it made).  The object was round in shape, and moved across the sky towards the left, all while it's color changed from a vibrant blue, to green, purple, red, orange, and so on.  It wasn't making any sort of sound, and didn't seem to be moving like it had a distinct front/rear and left/right. The object then changed direction with seemingly no effort, and did something similar to a figure 8 (still only moving at a medium pace). Just after the erratic movement, the object then proceeded to change it's shape from being round, to a more cigar shape with what looked like a bend in the center (it almost looked like a DNA strand in shape).   At this point, the object's two halves both started to change their own colors, all while the object started to move south and in a straight line.  The shape slowly morphed back into being round (as well as it's color back to a white), as the object increased speed and continued straight. It appeared that my first guess of it was being a few hundred up was wrong, because after a minute or two of this, the object then started to flash 3 times consecutively, every few seconds, as if it were exiting the atmosphere.  The object eventually disappeared after another minute or so, and no further lights/objects were seen again. I myself am an avid lover of UFOs and their mystery, but had yet to see anything abnormal in my life until this happened.;38.7425;-121.1947
