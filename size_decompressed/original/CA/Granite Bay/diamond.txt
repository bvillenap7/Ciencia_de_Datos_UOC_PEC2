Multi colored light pattern, spinning? Obj., maintaining stationary position in sky..  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinking star??  PD));2018-11-05 23:45:00;45 minutes +;Multi-colored light pattern, spinning?  Object, maintaining stationary position in sky Witnessed a multi colored stationary object in the sky.  Hard to determine shape, appeared diamond shaped.  Lights changed/flashed: red, blue, white, yellow.  Appeared to be spinning.  Called my adult daughter who was at a friend's house....they ran outside and also observed the same object.  I watched it for about 20 minutes, it never moved.  May have dimmed from time to time.  I went back outside a number of times to observe it, eventually after about 45-60 minutes, I looked and it was gone.  But, the whole time I observed it.  It remained absolutely stationary and exhibited multi colors, and rotated through the same pattern.  I tried to get pictures/videos but my phone is only good enough to capture darkness.;38.7425;-121.1947
