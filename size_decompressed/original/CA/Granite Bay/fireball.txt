Four fireball orbs hover over Placer/Sacramento County Line near Folsom Lake.;2013-05-11 21:15:00;5 minutes;Four fireball orbs hover over Placer/Sacramento County Line near Folsom Lake We were driving south on Auburn-Folsom Road toward Folsom Dam Road when we noticed in the sky, four orange or red orbs.  They were not helicopters.  They were suspended vertically at different angles, and they seemed to just sit there.  Other motorists saw them, and pulled over to look.  As we traveled south, they just disappeared, or extinguished themselves.  Could have been Chinese lanterns.  They all went dark at different times, not simultaneously.;38.7425;-121.1947
