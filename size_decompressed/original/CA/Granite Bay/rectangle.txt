Rectangular craft Uncloaks b4 two witnesses during meteor shower.;2015-04-01 22:30:00;3-5 seconds;Rectangular craft Uncloaks b4 two witnesses during meteor shower. During meteor shower, biggest in years.  Myself and my wife laying flat on our backs in a secluded grassy area on a picnic blanket around ten pm.   Huge meteor shows up, we track it w our eyes, as we track it, this rectangular ship LITERALLY APPEARS, not flew into our view, NO, this thing was cloaked, and it became visible b4 our eyes.  Simply moved slowly out of the way of the oncoming meteor and cloaked again. Literally happened in five seconds.   Wife saw it too.  Clear as day.  There wasn't even time to grab a cell phone shot.  This was two years ago?  I think.  And I wanted to report it to somewhere more credible than Mufon.  I hope this helps.  I do not mind answering any further questions you may have.   Thank you.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.7425;-121.1947
