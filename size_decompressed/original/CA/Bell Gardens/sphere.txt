It was a block or two away, and it was up a bit higher than the treetops.       I stared at it believing it must be tethered to a used car lot or something, but it looked way stranger than anything like that it actually looked like a fat flying saucer - almost like a little, tiny Saturn - however, it wasn't silver, it was covered with very bright lights, a light gold color.  The ring around it was also lit up and much smaller than anything in the old sci-fi movies of the fifties.         I couldn't pull over as there was nowhere to go and I would have caused an accident, so I kept my eye on it for the next several seconds till I lost sight of it due to trees and surrounding buildings.        It never scared me because it looked harmless as if there were a logical explanation for it, which, of course, I thought there had to be.  During the next several seconds while I'd lost sight of it, I wondered whether maybe a blimp could have dressed up as a flying saucer for some kind of promotional.  When I saw it again, it was about a mile or two away traveling south.  There was no way a blimp moves that fast or has the shape that I saw.  It was perfectly round with a small ring around it and clearly was not tied to any structure.  Still riding in my car after a few foiled attempts to pull over, I lost sight of it completely.  Somebody else had to have seen it.  It was above a densely populated area.;33.9674999999999;-118.1464
