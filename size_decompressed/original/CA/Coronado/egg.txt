As I lay looking up into a clear night sky first one fuzzy egg shaped object flew from edge of horizon and stopped briefly in my center of vision and stopped (object was at very high altitude and traveling faster than any aircraft known to me and I am a Naval Aviator, it was instantly joined by a second egg shaped object that flew up and stopped next to it and then both objects shot out into space and were gone in an instant. Not sure of the dates but believe it happened in early 80's. Providing this info so you may co-oberate someone elses report. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the source of the report, requesting that he check his flight logs for the precise date, which is approximate.  PD));32.6799;-117.1709
