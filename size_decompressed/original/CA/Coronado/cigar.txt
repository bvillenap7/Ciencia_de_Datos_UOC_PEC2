4 bright flashing light seen at a very high altitude in south Coronado bay area;2005-09-06 21:30:00;15 Minutes;4 bright flashing light seen at a very high altitude in south Coronado bay area I was at the Coronado Cays on a gondola boat ride enjoing a romantic boat ride when I noticed  4 flashing lights out in the eastern sky they flashed on for 1 second then off, these light were close together like in an offset line. I think the object was cirgar shaped becaues of the the four lights were just offset of each other.The craft was at a very high altitude, and it moved forward, sideways and backwards when the 4 lights flashed. I used the star's in the sky to dertermin which direction the object was moving. The craft moved from the eastern sky to the west then took a 90 degree turn to the north before returning to the east the whole time of the observation was about 15 minutes.;32.6799;-117.1709
