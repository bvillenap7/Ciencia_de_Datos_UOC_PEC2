Orange/red star like spheres seen in Trinidad, CA.;2014-05-18 21:15:00;5 minutes;Orange/red star like spheres seen in Trinidad, CA. While watching stars on my deck, I noticed a bright orange/red star at low altitude move slowly from the Pacific Ocean towards the east near my house.  The body was orange/red (with spikes of light, like a star) with a faint light (cone) shape in front of the aircraft. It was moving slowly in a straight line.  Then seconds later, 3 more objects moved in the same direction as the first one.  They looked the same as the first one, and but they had a faint cone of light surrounding them.  I could hear a subtle engine noise.  They were all about 1,000 feet in the air.   Then a fifth one was seen, moving in the same direction as the other 4. At first I thought they were balloons, but they moved faster than balloons, and I don't think balloons will come from the ocean onto land, nor travel at night.  There was really no wind to speak of.  They all disappeared from sight when traveling eastward from my direction. The lights didn't blink, nor were any normal colors seen (white, blue).  What struck me the most was the bright orange/red color, and the cone of light surrounding the main body of light.  My best guess is that they were drones, but if so, why fly 5 of them in the same flight path?  I was able to take photos, and also recorded some of the objects with my digital camera.
