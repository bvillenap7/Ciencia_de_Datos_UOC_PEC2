Large, motionless, thimble-shaped object radiating bright light from big windows, 1000 ft. over I-5.;1996-09-21 21:30:00;10 minutes;Large, motionless, thimble-shaped object radiating bright light from big windows, 1000 ft. over I-5. My UFO sighting began when I noticed an extremely bright light in the night sky over I-5 in northern California on or about 9/21/96, between the towns of Willows & Maxwell.  I was driving to work about 9:30 p.m. and saw what I took to be a CHP helicopter illuminating the freeway with a searchlight about 5 miles ahead. (This area is flat and the freeway lies in an almost straight line for miles.)  As I drove closer, I  realized the light was not circling the freeway but remainded absolutely motionless, and that instead of a searchlight, what I was seeing was radiated light coming from inside some type of large craft or object.  It was hovering about 1000 ft. above the freeway and as I drove almost directly under it, I could see it had a thimble shape (larger end up). I could view it clearly because of all the light that was coming from the large windows that surrounded it. I thought about stopping for a better look but didn't have a camera (naturally), and also thought to myself, Sure, get a real good look, like Travis Walton did,  so I kept going. I tried to watch it with my head out the window as I passed under it, but almost lost control of the car so I focused on driving and lost sight of it--nothing in the rear view mirror to indicate whether it was still there after I'd passed. There was normal traffic on the freeway that night and I regretted not having  a CB radio, because the truckers sure must have been hollering about it...;39.3169;-122.1891
