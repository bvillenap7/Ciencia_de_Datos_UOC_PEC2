It was so low that I could not see the entire thing.  I realized that there was no rotors and I don't remember any sound. It was clear up front.  I wanted to get a better look so I ran to the back of the house. It was still there. I saw no doors nor windows. I remembered that the binoculars were on the diningroom table so I ran in to get them. When I returned It was nowhere to be seen. I am seventy two years old and I will always remember.  The object was more elongated oval than cigar shape. It was not large in the center and pointed on ends. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));36.3001;-119.1295
