Oval ring of red lights, flares and streams over Sausalito Hills.;2017-09-26 02:00:00;>20 minutes;Oval ring of red lights, flares and streams over Sausalito hills Standing on the back deck facing west, I first saw a star that seemed alternately yellow and red.  I thought it was a plane.  Then I saw a plane fly past it, so it did not seem to be a plane itself.  Then I saw a continual succession of what looked like falling stars.  I thought that must be the answer, but as it continued, I realized it was very improbable.  Another thing I saw was streams of red light that were looping around.  I then thought it might be a a  controlled toy drone which I've seen around here.  But again the length of time it went on made that not seem likely and I couldn't explain the intermittenti ovals of small red lights as a drone.  Then I saw several different phenomena: plumes of red and yellow lights that looked like flares or fireworks red lights in an oval shape appearing and disappearing.  The usual Sausalito fog  seemed to part and a red whirlwind shape appeared.  This happened several times.  All of these phenomena continued for at least twenty minutes.   I went inside and the time was 2:15 a.m.  I wanted to stay and continue watching, but there was no sign of it abating and I went to bed.  The 20 minute time frame is approximate. I was so transfixed, I don't really know how long I observed it.  It could have been as long as an hour.  I should have taken photos, but I thought I wouldn't be able to get a good shot.  I am not a believer in extraterrestrial life, but what I saw was an something in the sky that I certainly couldn't identify or explain.  The only ordinary explanation I could come up with was a fireworks display, but fireworks over the hills of Sausalito at two in the morning seems pretty far-fetched.;37.8689333333334;-122.495675
