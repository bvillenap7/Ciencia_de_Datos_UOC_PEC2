Black triangular-shaped craft, moving very slowly 200 yards above our house weooo, weooo, weooo sound huge yellow beam in front.;2008-09-29 21:00:00;few minutes;Black triangular-shaped craft, moving very slowly 200 yards above our house weooo, weooo, weooo sound huge yellow beam in front. Around 9pm on Monday Sept 29, 2008, my son came inside from retrieving homework from our guest house, and exclaimed that he had been watching a stealth plane above his head.  He described a black triangular craft with a huge yellow beam projecting from the front, and some other lights around the edges.  It was moving extremely slowly, just above our house, went between the house and guest house, then over the trees beyond. It made a weooo-weooo-weooo sound.  To my knowledge, stealth planes don't move that slowly, so we are curious and wanted to report this sighting. (I reported it to the San Jose FAA Operation Unit, and they said they had received similar reports from that night, but that they believed it must be a helicopter.) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be sincere.  PD));37.4245;-122.296
