The fireball was in the southeastern sky. There was a trail behind the fireball, unknown distance. The object moved from a soutwesterly heading to loop back in an upward spiral toward the northeast. At the APEX of the loop back, about every 1-2 seconds an explosion could be seen. The object disappeared below the horizon, with a firetrail still in view as it disappeared.;37.4245;-122.296
