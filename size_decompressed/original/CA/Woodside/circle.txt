It was 1985 probably in the month of July or August, I don’t recall exactly.  Myself and 3 friends and their 2 dogs went out to a place near Woodside, CA more specifically to a place called Windy Hill at 4 corners where highway 84 (Woodside Road) crosses Skyline Blvd.  You can see 360 degrees from San Francisco to San Jose, The Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. It was approximately 11:30 pm and we had gone up to check out the view when I noticed 6 or 7 colored lights in the sky over what seemed to me to be approximately Half Moon Bay.  These lights were flying around and turning different colors, blue, green, red, yellow and orange but flying so fast and in such a way that there is no plane or helicopter that could possibly make the moves that these lights were making, zig zagging and going in circles just crazy moves and then would fly way out over the ocean what seemed like 50 miles in about 2 seconds and then come back and then towards the Bay and back and towards us and back, not together at all, they acted independently of one another and I was so frightened, I wanted to leave before they saw us. I said out loud, are you guys seeing this?  Are we all seeing this? They all said oh yes! What the hell are those?  Let’s get out of here!  I am sorry I can’t recall the exact date and time because it was so long ago.  But it is something I will never forget.
