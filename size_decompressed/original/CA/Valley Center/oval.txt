A UFO was spotted flying from the top of Palomar Mountain;2009-06-30 21:30:00;45 seconds;A UFO was spotted flying from the top of Palomar Mountain We are on the Rincon Indian Reservation in Valley Center, CA. On top of Palomar Mountain I saw a light blinking at the peak.  My friend and I thought it was the local observatory but our local friend stated there was no observatory on top of that mountain.  As soon as he made the statement we looked at the light and it immediately took off. The craft took almost straight off curving with the wind.  After floating to an altitude still under clouds it proceeded to travel towards the west.  We heard no noise coming from the craft, and we are well aware of the noises normal air crafts (i.e. helicopters, air planes, balloons, etc.) would make. We continued to follow the craft through the sky and it appeared to be football shaped.  All lights on the craft were white, and the two that were on the sides were blinking simultaneously, unlike and air plane whose lights will blink one after another. Soon after, the craft disappeared in the distance, but not necessarily out of the atmosphere.  Since the sighting now about an hour later, we have heard a helicopter flying around the area as well as some other lights, possibly vehicles, traveling to the top of the mountain. We are more interested in what else it could be, seeing as how Camp Pendelton is so close, but this is unlike anything we have ever seen before.;33.249;-117.0122
