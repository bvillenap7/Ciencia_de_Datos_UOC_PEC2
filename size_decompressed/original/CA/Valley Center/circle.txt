Noticed two large round lights in sky over the Mt. Palomar area.  At first they remained together for a couple minutes. As I watched them, one dropped from the sky to the horizon with great speed.  They remained stationary for several minutes then other lights began to blink and appear. Then the lights would go out and appear in a different spot. All together there were 4 or more lights blinking in different colors.  There was no noise at all. Were the two main and larger lights sending out smaller ones?  The two largest lights were still separated and stayed that way.  Smaller blinking lights began to appear in different spots but in the same area. Using a fence pole as an indicator of any movement by the lights, I was able to tell that the first two lights remained stationary in the sky.;33.249;-117.0122
3 orbs or circles witnessed by 2 people.;2017-03-13 22:00:00;15 minutes;3 orbs or circles witnessed by 2 people. At about 10 P.M., on March 13.  I noticed a flickering yellow light in the glass window of our front door.  Thinking that perhaps there was a fire in the area, I opened the door.  Directly to the west, I observed above the horizon and above the mountains an orb of brilliant yellow gold color.  Even at a great distance, it appeared to be flickering on the edges.  I called up to my granddaughter to look out also and see the bright light.   Then there appeared a second orb, then it disappeared and reappeared several times.  A third orb also appeared several times and would disappear.  The bottoms of the orbs were at different levels in the atmosphere.  This light show lasted approximately 15 minutes.   As we are located atop a hill in line with the Palomar Observatory, I wonder if they would have observed the same phenomena.  Also, we are south of Camp Pendleton on the coast so do not think it was a military exercise.   I have always been skeptical of UFO sightings (a graduate of the Bronx High School of Science and have my Masters in business).  We are enclosing 3 pictures taken by my granddaughter.
