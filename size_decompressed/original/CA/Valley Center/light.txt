My dogs woke me up earlier than usual to take them out to the restroom and that's when I saw this big bright light in the sky bigger than a star.  At first I thought it was a plane but it didn't move.  I kept watching and after 20 minutes I thought it merit to wake up my husband so he could take a look at it. He was impressed by it as well since it couldn't be an airplane or a star.  It was just a big bright stationary light in the sky.  He decided to call KUSI news just to have somebody else take a look at it.  As he was talking in the phone the light started getting smaller but we can still see it.  My husband is a real estate agent and I'm a stay at home mom.;33.249;-117.0122
