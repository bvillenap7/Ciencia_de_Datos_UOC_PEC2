A triangle of three flashing red round objects moving very fast and changing formation.;2004-11-15 17:55:00;minutes;A triangle of three flashing red round objects moving very fast and changing formation. I stepped outside and looked up in the sky as I always do(looking south ~ south west).  I saw 3 flashing/blinking red round objects moving fast in a triangular formation.  I ran and got my binoculars. The objects seemed as if they were chasing each other ~ at one point they were lined up ~ the 3rd object caught up to the 2nd object leaving 2 objects visable.  Then the 2nd object caught up to the 1st object which left one object in the sky. It was strange ~ the 3 objects became one and then it left my sight due to houses that were in the way.;33.8630999999999;-118.3923
