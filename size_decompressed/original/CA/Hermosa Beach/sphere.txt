I look up at the sky and try to point out what star is what.  One started moving.  ((anonymous report));2019-06-11 03:00:00;45 minutes;I had just finished working out and decided to walk down to the lifeguard tower #13.  I look up at the sky and try to point out what star is what.  The brightest lit star I guessed was Mars, Venus and Jupiter based on the warm color I was seeing.   After about 30 seconds, I notice it was moving as if it was an airplane far away so I said, “Wait, never mind.  That’s an airplane.”  Then, the ‘airplane’ swung back to where it was at and kept moving in a swinging motion.  Maybe swung about ¼”.  I felt like it was a drone because of the movement it had.  It would stay still for a few seconds, move up, down, left, right, in combinations. It had a blinking light to it too.  The light appeared to look as if it was an object far away and was spinning.  The longer I would stare directly at it, it would become blurry and I’ll look away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
