disappearing object during a sunny, clear daytime on Hermosa Beach, CA;2008-11-12 10:30:00;10 seconds;disappearing object during a sunny, clear daytime on Hermosa Beach, CA We, 2 white males (42 & 45), were running on the beach, between Manhattan Beach Pier and Hermosa Beach Pier southward at about 10.30 a.m. It was a clear, sunny day with the normal traffic in the air, commercial planes helicopters etc. I saw, what I first thought was a helicopter in a very high attitude, I would say about 20.000 feet, a gray or silver oval shape object, but it didnâ€™t move, just stayed there.   While we were still running I ask my friend If he sees that and what he thinks about that.  So we both looked towards the object, suddenly it started to lighten up, a bright white light, got bigger while I could see some, kind of electric aura around the light, the next moment when it was getting a bigger light ball It just disappeared right in front of our eyes, no clouds around, in the middle of the clear, sunny, blue sky.;33.8630999999999;-118.3923
