Speeding light flying by window;2011-05-13 01:20:00;2 seconds;Speeding light flying by window This morning at approximately 1:20 am I awoke to police car sirens.  I was lying in bed staring at my window when all of a sudden a bright light flashed by followed by a huge burst of wind followed by absolute silence.  Not a minute later the police sirens stopped.  I’ve lived here since December and have become quite used to cars driving by at all hours in the evening.  I’m a fairly light sleeper as I easily awake to people talking when walking by my apt.  I know what the sound of a car sounds like because I also work on a busy drive street.  You can make the sound of tires across pavement out just as easily as blinking police lights.  Neither were present in this incident.  This has happened twice now with the last time being a couple months back.  I did not report it then.;33.8630999999999;-118.3923
Strange Light Over Palos Verdes, CA, from Hermosa Beach Pier 6pm [Sunset];2016-02-08 17:00:00;1:30;Strange Light Over Palos Verdes CA from Hermosa Beach Pier 6pm [Sunset] I'm sure this can be easily debunked but still worth sharing. Today at 6pm [sunset] from Hermosa Beach Pier I saw an object over Palos Verdes peninsula. This object was brightly lit with a solid  green light that then turned into a solid red light. It was headed east [off the ocean] within 45 second it cross the Palos Verdes peninsula [20 miles]. It then landed bottom of the Palos Verdes hill. The Lights- Typically all FAA aircraft have blinking light[s] of some sort not solid bright light. also, The distance from me was approximately 10 miles and these lights were quite large. I'm down in Hermosa Beach often and it is very common to see helicopters overhead. This object's lights were larger that helicopter lights. Speed- The object traveled approximately 20 miles within 45 second then came to abrupt stop to then drop down straight down.  Although it didn't seem high off the ground it was just about parallel with the top of Palos Verdes which has a elevation of 1457ft.  It could have been easily flying at an elevation of 1300ft. where it landed close to sea level so it easily dropped over 1000ft within 4-6 seconds it landed on the edge of Palos Verdes/Redondo/Torrance area. The object could have been a drone or some known aircraft but the lights was seem to big and it's precision and speed made me skeptical.
