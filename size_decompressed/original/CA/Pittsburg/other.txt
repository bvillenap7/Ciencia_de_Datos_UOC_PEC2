Fireball sighting;1999-09-04 00:38:00;3 seconds;Fireball sighting I sighted a fireball very low in the southern sky.  It traveled in an east-to-west direction for approximately three seconds.  The fireball was bright green (similar to a flare)with a smoke trail.  I'm not sure if it made a sound since a busy road is nearby.  It burned up while in flight.  The time I've reported is accurate (I set my clocks to a time server.);37.9985;-121.8878
2 black dots following commertial air traffic.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-29 06:25:00;30 seconds;2 black dots following commertial air traffic partly cloudy skies at high altitude, pinkish color in commercial air craft exhaust vapor from pre dawn sunlight visible and showing aircraft direction easily.  Vapor trails observed were sharp and crisp due to absence of wind.   I was observing a line of 5 aircraft following  each other in line separated by a regulated distance of about 5 miles.  The next closest air traffic in the same direction was approx. 25 miles and following in the same flight pattern.  I looked back to the 1st group of aircraft and noticed 2 bright dots to the right rear of the last aircraft.  The observed bright dots were compared to turning on and off a light switch.   There were now 2 black dots to the right rear of the known aircraft. They were separated from the jet approx. the length of the jet itself and the distance between the 2 ufos by 1/2 the jet.  The 2 UFOs followed for approx. 5 seconds then traveled in south in the same pattern passing into a cloud formation approx. 20 miles away.   Unable to locate UFOs after that.  The unknown dots following the jet liner appeared to be the size of a airliner baggage cart in scale to the jet from observed distance. UFOs appeared as black dots and did not leave any vapor trail.  No other witnesses as I was the only person at the county bus stop at time of incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
