White light that was still only started to move 3 seconds after I started to record.;2016-09-16 23:33:00;2 minutes;White light that was still only started to move 3 seconds after I started to record. In the distance their are a row of normal red lights: but one light was yellow and slightly above the red rowed lights- After realizing the light hasn't moved I got my phone and started to record it-3 seconds into recording the light began to slowly move west.  And disappeared.   Shortly after a human aircraft from the west at a higher altitude was travelling east.  It was a white light than it shut off and turned to strictly a red light.
