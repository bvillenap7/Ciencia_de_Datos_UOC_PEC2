Huge triangle over Pittsburg, CA and Large Rectangles over Concord / Pittsburg;2010-03-01 23:00:00;3 min;Huge triangle over Pittsburg, CA, and Large Rectangles over Concord/Pittsburg I'm not sure of the exact date of the first REAL sighting... i had just gotten my father into the hot tub at our home near the marina in pittsburg. A huge Triangle with white/orange lights on the tips (3) and what looked like the tail of a plane sticking out of the back at about 45 degrees only it looked fake like it was a piece of pipe with white christmas tree lights wrapped around it that someone just stuck on for fun. It came directly over my house, really low, maybe 500 feet, headed north out over the water and then slowly off to the right (northeast) It made no noise and was really slow, there was a plane at a much higher altitude on the same heading and we could hear the jet sound from it. I haven't seen any more triangles but have noticed something that really bothered me several times since then. Huge dark rectangles.. barely distinguishable from the night sky. No noise no lights and travelling east over Concord and Pittsburg late at night. I would never have seen them unless i was already looking up and even then they were almost the same color and shade as the sky. The triangle was lit up like disco, but the rectangles i see now and then and have thought about reporting to the faa or local authorities cuz they could be anything...
