My wife oversaw somthing in the sky. I was driving and at a stop light i could visualy see 2 orange lights in the sky.  I found it odd and my wife was shocked i had never seen anything like it before. So i decided to pull over and get a closer look. At first i thought it might be a plane or somthing but it had no flashing light and wa just orange. so we pulled over the two lights were seprate from one another one was in the top right of the sky the other was towards the left. the one on the left slowly was going downwardthe one on the right witch we were mainly focusing on was going left and then shifted and went right it then stoped and either droped or somthing sparked underneath it as if it droped something the same collor as itself.  then it moved towards the right and blinked away. I couldnt belivre what i just saw i dindt know what to think of it i then focused my attention on the other light witch hade quickly changed its slow moving pace and went toward where the other had just disapeeard. it then reapeated then didnt drop anything but it bliked away. it was crazy . oddley i seen it again both in the same town with more witnesses i had already told the first sighting to. i will post seperatly on the date of 2/14/05 if anyone is interested ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

This is to the south, towards Clayton/Mount Diablo, to be exact, over a closed  Military installation shut down after WWII.  At first glance it looked like a plane from afar, but when I looked back it was GONE.  No jet trail, no trace of anything, just plain gone.   What was strange was how sunlight seemed to really glare off of the aircraft, almost like a material I haven't seen before, which is why I took the second glace. Within 20 seconds I checked radar, I have live data provided by FAA that I pay for, there was NO aircraft anywhere near.  It was moving to slow to be a jet, and dissapeared way too fast to be human, couldn't be a military craft because the base has been closed for decades. Two weeks later, I saw it AGAIN.  This time I was walking my dog, and didn't dare take my eyes off of it.  I shouted to a neighbor I had noticed was across the street to look, and we both watched. This thing dimmed out like a light burning out, is this evidence of manipulating time to propel craft at Godly speeds?  After it, disappeared into thin air, in complete shock, I went home, not wanting to stick around a second longer. About 15 minutes later, a military style helicopter, which during my twp years I have lived here, have never seen.  It circled the area for a good twenty to thirty minutes, as if  looking for something.;37.9985;-121.8878
