Orange Light Disappears Above Me;2009-06-27 20:50:00;3 minute;Orange Light Disappears Above Me I saw an orange light, that had a candle like glow, move silently across the sky. I was about 1000 feet above my back yard. It was like a light I had never seen before. As it passed overhead, my friend and I both had a feeling it was about to disappear. Suddenly it began to fade away in clear sight. After it was gone my friend and I talked about what we saw. We both saw some kind of metallic panel like lines, as if there was a structure within the light as the light faded away above us. This happened on June 27th around 8:40 pm in the San Jacinto mountains of southern California. ((name deleted));33.7012;-116.7269
