It;2002-04-17 03:30:00;10 seconds;I was driving west on I40, west of Needles, CA. about 3:30 am.  There were many semi trucks on the road who probably saw this, too.  It is a very desolate desert area. Suddenly a bright blue light illuminated my whole car from above.  Even though I was alone, I said what the hell is that and had to lean forward to look up through my windshield. I saw a huge blue light streak from above my car off to the right side of the road. It stopped in mid air and appeared to be a extremely bright, icy blue colored ball.It then flashed even brighter and vanished. It did not hit the ground as say a meteor might.  The only visible color was blue.   I had no way to determine the real size or distance from me.  A grapefruit held at arm's length was about the size of the ball as I could see it from my car.I am a professional artist and have never seen a UFO or anything like this before.;34.7824;-114.5871

I was sitting with other friend in front of the apt. that I live in,I was looking up at the contrails when I notice a very very white object off to side of the contrails but above. The size as I viewed it was about a quater of an inch if that or less. As I watched this I for a few mins. I mentioned to my friends to look up.  We all saw this object moving back and forth,side to side (left to right).  This object which for the mst part moved slow as we watched all of a sudden just darted north west. We LOST SIGHT OF IT, quick!!    I`ve never seen a UFO in my life until that day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.7824;-114.5871

I was looking up and a white ball of light grew out of the darkness. Then a green trail of light appeared in the center of the white light which had continued to grow. A craft with a single white light then left the area. The White circle of light continued to grow and looked like a giant ball of fog. Everything faded away within 5 minutes. The green trail remained the longest. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));34.7824;-114.5871
