Unknown falling object in Needles, CA.;2014-11-06 22:30:00;4 seconds;Unknown falling object in Needles, CA. On October 6th, 2014, ((sic.  November 06th, 2014)) around 10:30 pm I was driving east bound on interstate 40 just about 7 miles east of Needles, California, I was going to do a job on a big rig that was broke down on the rode which is pretty common for me to go out at all hours, many times when I have been on the road at night I do see falling stars, well on this night while me and my son were driving we both saw an object in front of us about ten miles ahead across the mountain top a bright green light going straight down at a very hight rate of speed and disappeared behind the mountain, at first my son said did you see that falling star and stated wow I never seen one like that before dad, and I replied, son that was no falling star or shooting star, that was something I have never seen, my guess is as it seemed to not slow down at all as we seen it that it must have hit the ground on the other side of the mountain top, no noise was herd and for the next few minutes while driving saw not! hing else.   I have my theories, but will keep them to my self.;34.7824;-114.5871
