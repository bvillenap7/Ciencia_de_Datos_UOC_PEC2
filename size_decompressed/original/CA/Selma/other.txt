Dim red/orange object slowed then sped up again while maintaining trajectory;2010-07-04 22:00:00;10-15 seconds;Dim red/orange object slowed then sped up again while maintaining trajectory My sighting occurred during an impromptu fireworks display at Lake Selmac near Selma and Cave Junction, Oregon.   I was looking up at the sky watching the fireworks, when I observed a very subtle red/orange shaped object moving from south south west to north north east at a very high rate of speed.  Actually the red/orange colored looked like more like an aura around a dark center.  It was too fast to be a normal satellite but slower than most shooting stars.  It wasn't bright like other objects in the sky and just barely noticeable.   One would have had to be looking right at it to notice it.  It was one of those cases of just happening to be looking at the right place at the right time.  The odd thing was that at one point it appeared to slow down and then speed up again. It never changed its course though.  The trajectory was very straight. To give you some background on me, I was a police officer for eight years before being medically retired.   What I saw wasn't a normal satellite like I see in the sky all the time.  It had a straight trajectory like a satellite but the slowing and speeding up part is not characteristic of satellites.;36.5691;-119.6191
