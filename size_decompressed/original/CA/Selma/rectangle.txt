I have hesatated for years to inform anyone of this sighting.   In or about February 1991, there was a report for any aircraft not to be in flight.  Because of the extreme high North West to South East winds.  My son a I went outside to tie down a tarp on an obove ground swimming pool.  As we headed back to the house, we look up into the sky and witnessed a HUGE aircraft about 100 yards above fly slow and accross the winds.  Flying North East to South West, it was huge and had lights of different colors and lasted for about five minutes.  It was reported that Law Enforcement also reported this sighting.  And I believe that the Selma Enterprise weekly news paper also reported the sighting by other people.  I remember it well.  At that time I had another Son in the military and in Desert Storm Iraq. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in February 1991 is approximate.  PD));36.5691;-119.6191
