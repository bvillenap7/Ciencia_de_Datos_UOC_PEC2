It had a very odd orange color light.  We continued watching it when it made a vary sharp series of turns in an S shape.  Before it disappeared behind the trees it changed to a blueish color then went straight down very rapidly then disappeared. 2 days later, on Monday, July 29 2013 at approx 8:30 PM I was once again in my back yard when I started watching another bright orange light, this time to my immediate East. It moved very rapidly toward the North.  At first I assumed it was a F-16(as there is a Airport and Base in the area) but it vanished.  It wasn't quite dark yet, so if it merely turned off its lights I would have still seen the plane, but the craft wasn't there anymore and a sound never accompanied the light.  Another friend was with me and witnessed this as well.;36.5691;-119.6191
