The Plane flew behind this object which I believe to have been approximately 5000 in elevation.  The object drifted slowly to the northwest.   It had what could have been a single light or a reflection from the Sun but had something hanging from it that was swinging from side to side.  I suspect that whatever it was that was hanging was large enough and long enough for me to see it from that far away.  I took pictures with my cell phone but have been unable to distinguish the object in the photos;34.2363;-118.4798
