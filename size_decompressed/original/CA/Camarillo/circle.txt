It was still dark, I only remember passing one car on Port Hueneme road near the Small Private Camarillo airport. I saw a huge white light in the sky at first I thought it was the moon. Then it started heading west at a high rate of speed with what appeared to be fire behind it making me think it was a meteor. But then the object changed directions and headed in my direction. It just looked light a huge round white light. I slowed my car and watched it for a what seemed like a long time. I was suprised when it came towards my car hovering over me for a while. I noticed I was staring right into the light and it didn't hurt my eyes. It didn't make any sound.  As I passed under it.  I looked back and it was gone.  When I got to work in Oxnard there were some people in the parking lot that had witnessed the event from there. That's how big this thing was.

My friend,((Name deleted))f, saw it first. He said What's that shiny thing in the sky? I said, Where? I don't see it. then I found it, and pointed it out to mmy other friend. Then, my friends went along their own ways, and I was looking at it still, I lost sight of it at times, but I always fouind it. When it was above me, I saw that the bottom was circular, with three Lights or something making a triangle.  Before that, I saw that it was flashing too. My friend, ((Name deleted)) saw it first. He was saying to me, look at that shiny thing in the sky. And I looked, and I saw nothing, so I said, I can't see it. Then I found it, and I was staring at it for a good minute there.It was moving around in a way I don't think anything on earth can do. And then, I pointed it out to my other friend, Amanda, and she saw it too. We were running the mile, because it was PE, and so ((Two names deleted)) jogged off. But I was still looking at the object. the side of the object was weird, i can't really describe it. When the object was above me, I could see the bottom was circular, and there were three lights forming a triangle. I had to at least jog for the mile, so I looked away for a moment and started to jog. When I looked back, It wasn't there. My friends are very nice ant trustworthy, I don't think they did something, obvious there, because we were in school!;34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
