Three white objects in a loose triangle formation moving ESE;2005-10-09 16:11:00;15minutes;Three white objects in a loose triangle formation moving ESE It was around 4:11 and I was walking East through a parkinglot on Ponderosa Drive when I noticed three white objects in the sky.  They were not quite directly overhead and appeared to be stationary.  They were in a loose triangle arrangement with two of them fairly close to eachother and the other one to the upper right.  Their apparent location relative to the trees seemed to change over the course of a few minutes and I gathered they were slowly drifting in a south east direction.  There was one point where the two close ones started to move closer to eachother until they almost appeared to be one object, and then separated by a few inches again.  After about 15 minutes I lost sight of them as they moved further and sank into the great blue yonder   I suppose they could have been balloons in a calm spot but they struck me as moving in a somewhat peculiar manner for balloons so maybe someone else got a better look.;34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
Bright buzzing light.;2009-11-13 03:00:00;3-4 seconds;Bright buzzing light. Well it was a round 3:00 am on 11/13/2009.  My wife and I were in bed watching some television. While in bed we both saw and heard a bright light pass from one side of the window to the other.  The really weird thing was the buzzing sound it made.  The only way I could explain the sound would be like an electrical buzz.  My wife and I talked about the event for a second to make sure we both heard and saw the light.  Then we headed down stairs to see if we could see anything.  Well we found nothing. My wife and I have never had an experience like this.;34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
