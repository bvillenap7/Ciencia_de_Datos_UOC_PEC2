Spinning lights on cigar shaped object.;2012-07-28 22:00:00;5 minutes;spinning lights on cigar shaped object. rotating lights, flashing and blinking. moving at a steady speed, it had a red blinking light on top. we thought it was a blimp at first but we were headed south on the 101and it was traveling in the same direction. which is why im reporting it, because if it were a blimp, we couldnt see the lights if it were traveling in the same direction. it moved at a steady but fast pace. weird.;34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
