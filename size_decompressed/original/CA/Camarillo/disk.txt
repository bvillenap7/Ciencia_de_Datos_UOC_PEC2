A flying saucer with many lights (some colored) was seen from my house at 1:30 AM.;2002-05-20 01:30:00;?;A flying saucer with many lights (some colored) was seen from my house at 1:30 AM. This past Monday night, I got off of work pretty late, around midnight, and went home.  I made myself some spagetti, and watched the tonight show for a little while.  I was not very tired because I had alot of coffee after work, and caffine keeps me up, and since I had the next day off, I didn't see any rush to get to bed.  I was just about to head to bed at about 1:30 when I took my cocker spaniel outside to use the bathroom before she went to sleep for the night.  As I go outside, I was looking upp at the sky because the stars are very visable from my house, especially at that time of night.  I saw what seemed to be a round object moving fairly slowly around the sky.  It had bright lights, was definetly brighter than any star or planet.  My dog saw it also, as she started to bark.  I noticed blue and red lights on it as well.  As it was hovering pretty far up, it moved in circles, not straight like an airplane or satalite would, changing directions frequently.  I was amazed and immediatly ran inside to get my husband.  When he came out, at first we couldn't see it, but after another minute or so, it appeared again, and did the same thing, circling around.  We watched it for another five or so minutes, and then it was no where to be found again.  I am sure this was no airplane or anything else of that nature.  It did not make any sound (that which we could hear at least) and did not look like anything I had ever seen.  I did not believe in UFOs until this night, but you can bet I know what I saw, and I believe in them now! ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of a flurry of reports we received from Ventura County, CA, following three telephone calls we received on May 18, 2002, from a raucous student party.  The reports seemed to us to be not convincing at the time of the call, a fact which we shared with the callers.  Shortly afterwards, approximately a dozen reports were submitted from that area.  We have no way of confirming any of these reports.  PD));34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
Lewis Rd./ Camarillo FLYING SAUCER UFO seen in daylight during November, 2005;2005-11-15 16:00:00;8 minutes;Lewis Rd./ Camarillo FLYING SAUCER UFO seen in daylight during November, 2005 I live in Camarillo off of Lewis Rd. a few blocks from Ventura Blvd.  The nearest cross-street is Adolfo Rd and Lewis Rd.  It was sometime in November or December of 2005 in the afternoon around 4:30 pm. I was using the internet inside the house when I heard my two dogs outside errupt in a frensy of barking that seemed particularly alarming.  I tried to ignore it for a while, but it only got worse and I was alarmed too. I went outside to see what on earth was going on and I found my grandmother sitting in the garden.  She told me excitedly that she had been yelling for me for a while to come and see a strange craft in the sky though I had not heard her.  She had been watching it approach the house from the direction of Ventura Blvd towards Adolfo Rd., hovering, then flying in a path paralel to Lewis Rd. The dogs were disturbed, barking like crazy looking upward at the sky over our backyard fence.  I looked up and saw a light grey to silverish, reflective, solid disk hovering silently past the house rather slowly and indecisively and then picking up speed.  Amazingly, it had the solid metalic bulk of a normal aircraft but with a saucer-disk shape and  could slowly hover and float silently and weightlessly like a baloon and then pick up speed and follow a straight path.  It had a reflective, very shiny exterior.  I could see it very clearly and was amazed.  It was like no aircraft I have ever known to exist in fact.  It looked like your typical 1950's flying saucer. My grandmother said that she had been watching it approach for some minutes and that it had been very low over the house and had ascended a bit by the time I saw it.  It was oddly silent and left no trail.  I was surprised that my dogs were so disturbed by it since they don't react at all when noisy helicopters and planes fly over the house often and at times quite low since there is an airport and a military base nearby.  They seemed to be able to distinguish the unique and alarming nature of the craft as well as we two humans could. I want to stress that we had a perfect view of the UFO as it was directly over the house and we both clearly saw it.  As I watched it, it finally picked up speed, ascended and disapeared and reapeared in the atmosphere until about a block away it vanished. In the past, when I have seen footage of UFO's, I have believed that they were pathetic ploys for attention and the result of special camera effects.  I now know that this is not always the case.  What I saw confirmed the t.v. footage I have so long been skeptical of, expcept, in person the sighting is clearer and more dimensional and tangible and truthful than a camcorder can convey.  Sometimes the t.v. footage looks blured.  What we witnessed was a solid clear craft.  The truth of its shape was tangible though extraordinary.  I wondered in amazement that a flying saucer could silently and boldly skoot though the skies of a quiet suberban neighborhood in such a clandestine way.  I had to see it to believe it. My friends say they have seen strange glowing UFO's in the dark early morning skies before work that are star-like but absolutely not stars.  They note that there are many sightings around military bases and think that these are secret government projects kept from the public.  It makes me wonder.;34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
Silver disc hovers high over rush hour traffic then speeds off over Pacific Ocean.;2012-06-07 17:15:00;15-30 seconds;Silver disc hovers high over rush hour traffic then speeds off over Pacific Ocean. Rush hour... 101 northbound.  Saw a solvery bright circle/oval in the wester/northern sky.  Silver disc looked like it had a convex bottom... either above the sun's height reflecting the sunlight and super huuuge, or closer and emitting its own white light?!?!?!   It seemed to hover for a few seconds then race off shrinking into the sky over the pacific ocean.  It seemed to go from round to crescent shaped like a reflection of the sun on the moon as it sped off.  I don't believe the hype but I saw SOMETHING !!!!!

I snapped a photo of some beautiful clouds with my Samsung Galaxy S9.  I looked at it about 40 minutes later and noticed a small object near the top I hadn't noticed while snapping it. I zoomed in and saw a disc shaped object reflecting sunshine on top.  The bottom of the disc is dark .;34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
