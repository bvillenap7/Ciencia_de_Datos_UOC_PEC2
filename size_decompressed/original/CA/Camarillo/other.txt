Multiple lights decend in formation, stop and form a swarm, then form two bright lights and mimic cessna and dissapear over horizon.;1998-01-06 18:00:00;3 minutes;Multiple lights decend in formation, stop and form a swarm, then form two bright lights and mimic cessna and dissapear over horizon. I do not remeber the exact date or time and some of the finer details of this event however it took place in early January, I believe in 1998. A more accurate report was filed with the Ventura/Santa Barbara MUFON chapter.  I was sitting in the car parking lot of Albertsons in Camarillo. It was the early evening and the sun had just set. The sky was sufficiently dark to see stars and it was clear exept for maybe a few cirrus clouds. I was facing NW and had just reached forward to change the radio station when out of the corner of my eye, to the right, I saw what I had first thought to be firework embers falling down from the sky. There were about 12 to 20 whight lights, about the magnitude of polaris, falling down in a ring formation. Suddenly these firework embers did something rather unusual. They stopped dead in the sky. This ring was suspended at what I estimate to be an altitude of maybe 1500 feet though I am not good at estimating altitude and they maye have been much higher.  After about 1.5 second pause, these lights suddenly started swarming around eachother erradically. If I recall correctly some were glittering. This swarm moved almost right overhead me and some of the lights left the swarm and flew around the sky while others appeared to join the swarm from higher altitudes.  Two of the lights in this swarm started to become brighter and most of the lights in the swarm merged with these two brighter lights while the remaining ones flew out of the swarm and faded from few. These two bright lights now moved closer to eachother and then started blinking on and off in sequence. One would blink on while the other would blink off. At this point in the event, the object(s) would easly pass for a cessna. The blinking lights slowly began to move NW, parallel with the hill that runs behind Camarillo where I eventually lost sight of them behind the houses on the horizon.  I ran inside the market to tell my mom what I had just saw. A few minutes later on the way home we saw three or four fighter jets, in formation, flying from the direction the lights disappeared from. I imagine the jets were dispatched from Vandeberg AFB. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
Unbelievable craft observed at low altitude over Camarillo, CA.;2002-08-02 22:30:00;15 seconds;unbelievable craft observed at low altitude over camarillo, CA. Was listening to CTCAM and heard you request any UFO sightings anyone may have had.I reported this by e-mail to the CTC program at the time of the observation but recieved no reply.. I have a BS degree in applied physics and worked 27 years as an aerospace engineer (flight and fluid mechanics) for the navy performing research and development testing of missile systems at the Naval Missile Center Pt Mugu, Ca. Standing in my lemon orchard in Camarillo, Ca on Aug 2, 2002 10:30 p.m. to watch annual meteor shower. No city lights, very dark. Facing eastward looking upward, extremely clear sky black as pitch except background of stars and moon at my back. to the west. Suddenly a craft with no lights and no sound moved rapidly from south by southwest to north by northeast across my line of sight . Would not have seen it since it was flat black against a dark background but it was faintly illuminated by the moonlight so there was enough contrast to see outline. Would not have noticed it except my eye caught the motion and I watched it traverse the night sky until it was no longer observable. The following are my observations  1) craft was controlled: smooth transition, constant altitude, constant velocity, constant direction  2) time to transit across my field of view: approx 15 seconds. velocity estimated above mach 12  3) approximate altitude: only a guess but I estimate 15,000 ft - 20,000 ft  4) size: very large (huge).  I estimate 200 ft - 300 ft length (minimum)  5) shape: concentric symetrical shape, flat undercarrige, beveled edges fore and aft rising to a flat upper surface (picture two inverted pie pans one smaller on top of the larger)  6) ratio of height to length: rough estimate 1 : 6  (no idea of top profile since I was looking at it broadside)  7) sound: absolutely none - silent  8) lights: none. totally flat black. barely illuminated against dark night background by reflected moonlight.  9) features: none that I could discern, surface appeared smooth  10) propulsion: not chemical, no combustion, no sign of heat or exhaust no sound  11) anamolies: extremely large, apparently frictionless motion, no sonic wave, no sound , no visable lights or leading edge surface heating,    Conclusion:  Observed  a UFO of unknown origin. material structure unknown, propulsion prossibly electromagnetic or gravity field manipulation, independent of aerodynamics, frictionless-no visible leading edge heating and no sound origin unknown..impossible to account for observation using known science and technology.  Unfortunately, I was alone and there are no other witnesses. no reports in the newspaper either.  I attest, and swear to, the truth of this event and my observations.;34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391

No sound at all. Picture of some kind on the side of plane.  It then started to move, smoke and then plane disappeared completely and saw two flashing lights that also disappeared.;34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
Noiseless object flies overhead at roughly 1000-1500 feet.;2008-10-22 22:30:00;5 Minutes;Noiseless object flies overhead at roughly 1000-1500 feet. My wife and I started to walk the dogs and noticed a very bright light that was too high for a street light / building light, etc... - and too low for anything natural (stars / planets).  As we comtinued to walk, a neighbor was approahing us while also walking his dog.  I asked him what he thought of the light, he said interesting because it appeared to just stay in one place.  As we stopped and talked for a few minutes while the dogs did their thing, the light didn't move.  The neighbor eventually went his own way and my wife and I stayed until the dogs could finish.  After about another two or three minutes, we noticed the light eventually started to come in our direction. Now since we saw movement, we stopped focusing on the dogs and watched it closely.  Within about 30 seconds, it was noiselessly going right over our heads, and only about 1000-1500 ft off the ground.  No strobes, in fact no lights whatsoever.  AS it was overhead, we couldn't even see t! he original light that got our attention.  It was in the shape between a diamond, and a spade on a deck of cards, with the more pointed part being in the front of the aircraft.  My wife quickly tried to run home (which was about 7 houses down the block), to get our camera in hope of getting this before it was too late.  By the time she and our son appeared out of the house, it was dissapearing East of us towards Thousand Oaks.  It should be noted, my BS is in Aeronautics and, I have worked as an Aircraft Mechanic / Manager in the Navy for over 23 years.  I might not havre seen every kind of aircraft, but I feel pretty confident that I have enough experience to recognize something when I see it...this was not an aircraft.
