I saw it outside of my window, and I saw another one, this time, it was red. I took 1 picture of it. I was just getting ready to go to bed, when I saw a bright, white light. I looked outside of my window, and I saw someting moving VERY fast, faster than a jet. A few minutes later, I saw another one. This time, it was red. I took 2 pictures of it, but only 1 came out.  They were roundish in shape, and I was awed by the colors of the objects.;34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
Two crafts coming out 90 degrees from a burst of light.;2000-11-25 19:30:00;10 seconds;Two crafts coming out 90 degrees from a burst of light. Driving on the 101 North almost out of the San Fernando valley,I saw a burst of light that glowed like a star from the No-West skies.Seconds later 2 lights came directly out of the bursts side at 90 degrees and hovered for a few seconds.I dont remember what the lights did after that.The lights were much smaller than the burst and looked alot like headlights(which is what I summed it up to be).Los Angeles Thanksgiving weekend busy streets and skies. Then 10 minutes later Art Bells websight announced there were ten sightings of a UFO over Camarillo,California.Thats just what I saw!! So I told my story and sent it to Art Bells web site.Please send me other reports if any,this is my first real sighting that was confirmed...Thank you ((name deleted));34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
strange light above air base in southern California;2003-12-09 18:30:00;30min;strange light above air base in southern California I do not have a camera and it could not drawn because it was just a bright light that I could see from a mile or three away. I thought it was an rocket from the air base but it sat there in the sky for almost 30 min. Then it began to sink into the horizon out of my point of view. It could be a star but this would have been the birghtest star I have ever seen. It looked like it was definitley inside our atmosphere. Simply because I could not see any stars around it. The only stars I could see were directly above me. The stars above me were very dim due to the marine cover that was setting in. We are due for rain tomarrow so the clouds are building off the coast. The light was west of me so it was in the direction of the fog on the horizon but I could see it like it was right in front of the marine cover. I could see lots of planes flying around in the sky mostly five at a time. I saw two jets one below the object and one above it fly past the object coming from the south. I could tell they were jets because of how fast they moved past the object from such a great distance. It looked like alot of activity in the sky all at once then when I couldn't see the object because it went below my point of view I saw less and less air traffic. I am used to seeing bright stars in the sky but this was not a bright star it was inside our atmosphere. I have a feeling that this is goig to be over looked and not reported or it will be described as a weather ballon!;34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
Light circles star and then fades out.;2006-03-11 19:25:00;3 seconds;Light circles star and then fades out. This was a very brief incident but I still got a fairly good look. I was walking west down N. Rowland Drive in Camarillo and I happened to glance upwards.  I saw what appeared to be a light traveling around the star Sigma Cassiopeiae, also called Ruchbah  I saw it circle once and once it broke from the circle it traveled south west a short distance before quickly fading out. I would say the radius of the circle was a fourth of an inch or a little more at arms length. The object was slightly brighter than the star originally, and was whitish in color. When I first caught sight of it it seemed to be transitioning from one direction of motion, to another, and entered the circle shortly thereafter.  My exact coordinates at the time were 34 degrees 13' 30.23 N   119 degrees 02'45.74 W at an elevation of 143 ft above sea level.  It was moving slightly faster than a satellite.

These objects were flying quietly in a very long straight line.When I first looked in the sky I thought it was a bunch of stars until I noticed that they were moving in a perfect straight line going in a northeastern direction.I watched for about ten minutes.;34.2252478260871;-119.029715217391
