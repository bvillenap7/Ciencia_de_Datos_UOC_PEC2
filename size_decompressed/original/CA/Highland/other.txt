Calif.) Mr. S.C. was proceeding to pull out of a driveway into traffic on Del Rosa Ave. in Highland (east of San Bernardino) when he looked to the north and saw what he first thought to be a giant black bird hovering over the San Bernardino Mountains in the vicinity of Lake Arrowhead.  He quickly discerned that it wasn't a bird and grabbed his 7X binoculars he keeps in his vehicle for a closer look.  He described the object as black, cylindrical with seagull-like wings.  Size estimated to be 3-inches long at arms length.  Duration of sighting approx. 3-4 minutes from the time he first noticed it until he watched it shrink down to pin point size while still viewing it through binoculars. Object was clearly over the mountains suggesting an altitude of approx. 7500-8000 ft.  The witness stated that he'd seen alot of strange lights in the sky before but nothing he couldn't attribute to normal aircraft or stars, this one was different.  He said it made a believer out of him.  ((NUFORC Note:  Thank you for the report, Cinde!  Peter;34.1301;-117.2044
Low flying military aircraft seen in the area which is out of the ordinary.;2010-07-04 19:30:00;5 minutes;Low flying military aircraft seen in the area which is out of the ordinary. On Sunday July 4th 2010 about 19:30  I was inside my home and heard military sounding jets flying rather low around the area.   I went outside and saw 2 what appeared to be F-15’s, due to the dual vertical stabilizers on the tail, flying at a rather low altitude.  They made two rather large circular passes at (not more than a few thousand feet up) and then proceeded in a south westerly direction.   I also saw a C-17 flying a couple hundred feet level over the old Norton Air Force Base at the same time.  I lost sight of both aircraft (C-17 and F15’s) due to the trees near my home.  This lasted maybe 5 minutes in total.   I am born and raised in this community and have not seen anything like this since the Air Force Base was an active military facility some 15 years ago or more.;34.1301;-117.2044
