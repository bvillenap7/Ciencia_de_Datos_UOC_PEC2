We saw a large burning object on fire.  It burned bright orange floating slowly in the upper atmosphere, it was centered to the left of the moon.   As it came down it started to disintegrate, like a piece of paper on fire.  There was smoke and fire as it disintegrated.  As it came to earth I could see black smoke coming from the object and fire as well.  It didn't move fast, like a meter.  Saw no other reports on this sighting.;34.1301;-117.2044
