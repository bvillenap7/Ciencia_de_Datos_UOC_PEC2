After stopping for gas, we saw that it was still in the same spot, and was hovering motionless.  Traffic on the freeway slowed to a crawl, hence the many witnesses.  Some people had even pulled to the shoulder, and had stepped out of their vehicles to capture the lights on video. There was a second, reddish light that exhibited motion as it floated towards the freeway behind us.  It was all very surreal, and it haunts me to this day.;34.1301;-117.2044
Witnessed an orange/white dot in the sky.  It was creating a fan shaped area of light around it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch.  PD));2017-09-23 22:45:00;3-5 minutes;I witnessed an orange/white dot in the sky...  it was creating a fan shaped area of light around it as if it were traveling faster than it. It would slow and speed it up- when slowing, the fan shape would become taller from top to bottom above and below the light. When it would accelerate, the fan shape would compress and seem seem to trail longer behind the light instead of taller... I pointed it out to my neighbor and he also saw it. He immediately called it a Strange Occuranceâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Vandenberg AFB.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
