The light was traveling very quickly faster than a satellite would have been  , or at least I think so . At about highnoon it grew brighter then disapeared . Could this have been a ufo or a satellite .  ??;35.123;-120.6193

Moveing east to west in a triangle formation, the east being the tip an the west two lights made the base.  The lights where orange, like hologen street lights in color. Flying just belleow the clouds at 2500 to 3000 foot above sea level. Then just vanished, no noise, very smooth flight path.  As they where vanishing they seemed to dim them grow brigther them just truned off or vanished.;35.123;-120.6193
