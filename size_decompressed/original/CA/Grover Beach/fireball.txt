First of all I would like to know if anyone else saw this, they had to!  Can you at least get back to me and tell me if they reported it?  I would greatly appreciate it.   At first I thought maybe I was seeing another lift off from Vandenberg airforce base south or here about 35-40 miles.  But after 2-3 seconds I knew it wasn't since there was no trail of thrust rockets.  And sice the base is due south of my house, it couldn't have ben a lilft off because it was going from left to right, east to west, between the cresent moon and venus ( or jupiter).  Also. it was going on a downward angle from my vantage point about 15 degrees I would guess.  All I can say is that it was a fireball of sorts, orangish in color, not blue or white.  And, it was going relatively slowly compared to a shooting star.  In the few seconds I saw it, it had moved accross the sky about 8-10 inches at arms length.  I don't know how many degrees that would be.  All I can say is that if you stetch your arm out and point to the sky,move your index finger about 10 and that's about how far I saw it travel.  The size is also hard to judge or determine.  Again, if you hold your arm out like before and make about a quarter inch gap between your index finger and thumb, that would be about how big it was.  It was on fire and flickered then disappeared, not much of a trail.  I thought  afterwards that maybe I saw a plane crashing, God forbid!;35.123;-120.6193
