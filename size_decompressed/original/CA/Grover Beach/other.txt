Grover Beach UFO coming from ocean;1979-02-15 21:30:00;3 minutes;Grover Beach UFO coming from ocean See below:  I saw the same thing but in 1977-1978, it was coming from the ocean at about 9:30 pm.  It was shaped more like a mantis (the fish).  This was also seen by another person that same night and reported to the news paper( Five Cities Times Press) there was an article in the news paper about this. My husband and I rented a beach house at Pismo Beach back in February of 79.  We arrived there at approx. 2 am.  My husband had already taken some of our baggage up the twenty or so steps to the house and was unlocking the front door.  I was unloading the few remaining items from the truck.  My little dog jumped out of the truck and ran to some nearby garbage cans, I assumed she saw a cat. I just happened to look up to admire the clear, starry night sky.  Almost directly above me was a huge, dark triangular shape.  It had three lights, one in each corner.  I was terrified.   I shouted to my husband  what is that? he said a helicopter.  It was no helicopter, this thing made absolutely no sound whatsoever and the sheer size of it blotted out the star filled sky above me.  I called my dog a few times until she finally came back to me and I grabbed her up.  The object will still hanging above me, motionless and without a sound.  I ran up the steps to the house and as I reached the porch, the triangle darted off toward in a northeasterly direction.   I have no way of knowing just how high it was in the sky but it seemed to me that it must have been quite low due to the enormous span.
