Very large, bright meteor with short, red tail descending very slowly near harvest moon.;2015-09-28 20:00:00;9 seconds;Very large, bright meteor with short, red tail descending very slowly near harvest moon. I am responding to a witness’s previous report of the same object seen in southern California. I was attempting to view the “remnants” of a lunar eclipse from the previous weekend, but missed the event, as I am in the mountains, and had to climb upon a high ridge to see the rising moon. This was the largest, brightest, meteor I’ve ever seen, and it appeared to travel in slow-motion compared to other meteors I’ve witnessed in the past. I counted the duration of the event as 10 seconds. For me, the meteor traveled from south to north, almost “into the harvest moon,” before disintegrating. It had a short, bright red tail and very large, brilliant white, spherical head. When I tried to find info on this meteor using the internet today, the previous account was the only record available.  I wish to substantiate it with my report.
