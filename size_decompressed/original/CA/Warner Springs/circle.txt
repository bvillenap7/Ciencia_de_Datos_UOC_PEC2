April 16, 2008 I was riding in a truck with a friend coming from a meeting in Warner Springs, California, we were heading west bound toward Temecula, when I saw an object coming down from the sky at about 9:00 PM Wednesday night.  There was only one object.  The object was round and the size of the moon, which caught my attention because it was so big.  It was coming down in a N/W downward slant ahead of us.  It was navy blue with gold and red around the outside rim.  I expected to hear a boom or feel the ground shake because of its size and because it seemed to be so close.  But nothing was in the paper or news.  A few days later I was watching the History Channel and they said many sightings have been found to go into the ocean.  If it didn’t hit land it could have gone into the Pacific Ocean because it was going in that direction.  I don’t know where it went or landed for sure but I do know what I saw and being we were in an area where there are no lights and open fields, nothing to reflect from I knew I saw this object and I had a witness, this is the first sighting I’ve ever experienced seeing.  I am a minister and my witness is a college student and housewife.;33.3111;-116.6495
