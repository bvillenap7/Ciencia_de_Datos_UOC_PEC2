Perfectly symmetrical silver cylinder flying object with no emissions high rate of speed horizontal;2001-07-15 12:00:00;3 minutes;Perfectly symmetrical silver cylinder flying object with no emissions high rate of speed horizontal We looked up into the sky and saw a very fast moving cylinder shaped object.  It was silver in color and approximately 1000-5000 feet in the air.  We saw a large passenger jet high above it also, and they fly at 30000 feet.  It was perfectly symmetrical, had no wings, no sound, and no emissions coming from it.  It appeared to be flying from North to South direction.  There was only one, and it flew perfectly horizontal the entire time.  I was an electronics technician in the Navy at the time, and my wife and I were completely surprised and mesmerized by this object and the speed it was going.  If I had to guess, it was approximately 10-30 feet long.;33.3111;-116.6495
