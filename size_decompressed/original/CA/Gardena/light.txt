Strange light beam follows diamond shaped object.;2016-11-14 22:03:00;<10 seconds;Strange light beam follows diamond shaped object. I was walking my dog southbound on the west side of a residential street.  I often stargaze when walking and was looking up at the super moon when a light caught the corner of my eye. I looked southeast and saw what appeared to be a searchlight sweeping to the west.  It had a peculiar rounded diamond shape at the head but was a round light beam off into the distance behind a row of houses.   It appeared to be very distant, but was low and rising as it went west, it faded away from the back and disappeared to my southwest.  The beam of light was very bright, like a searchlight at a casino or car dealership, but it was very focused and dense.  It disappeared after only a few seconds.;33.8928727699529;-118.292207511737
