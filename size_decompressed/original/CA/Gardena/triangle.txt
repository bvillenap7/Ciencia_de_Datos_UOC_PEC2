It was up pretty high, yet the craft was large enough to identify. I was at my sisters house, and went outside to have a smoke.  My brother was outside as well.  It was a clear evening, no clouds in sight. Both my brother and I were outside talking, and looking up at the sky. I stopped in middle sentence and asked my brother what is that, with sheer excitment in my voice. We both saw something flying overhead. At first my brother thought they might be geese flying overhead because of the V pattern.  I grabbed my binoculars and noticed that this was a craft of some sort. This object appeared to be gliding with no sound.  It seemed to be a large craft flying at an altitude of 1000ft. It was a Vshaped object with what appeared to be white circular lights, I would say maybe three on each side with one at the point of the V. The lights were not bright at all, very dim glow.   It was heading in the eastern direction.  This is one of three sightings I have seen in the past year.  A few months ago my sister, brother, and I were outside and saw a circular craft, this also had a dim glow to it, and last year I saw a grey triangle craft.  I now keep my eyes to the sky every night waiting to see what type of craft I'll see next.;33.8928727699529;-118.292207511737
