I was looking out the door at 2 helicopters that had been circling for about 3 hours over an Auto Insurance Auction facility in Gardena, CA near 182nd St & Vermont Ave. I spotted a cigar shaped white or silver object traveling fairly slow. I asked my friend 'Is that a plane?', he stayed silent and watched it with for for the next 3 minutes. There were power lines that obstructed the view, which the craft passed behind but never emerged from behind the wire.;33.8928727699529;-118.292207511737
