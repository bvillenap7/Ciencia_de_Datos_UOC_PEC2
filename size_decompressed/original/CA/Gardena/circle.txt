Bright Circle seen in sky in Gardena  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  May be hoax.

We arrived there around 10:40pm.  We got our drinks and went outside to talk.  The sky was very clear that night.  While my friend was talking to me I looked up at the sky and saw this very bright circle in the sky around 10:50 pm and thought to myself Wow, the moon looks very big today. I then realized that the circle was really close so then I thought, Wait a minute, that’s not the moon, and as I thought that I pointed to the sky and said to my friend, Look what is that?! and she looked up at it and as soon as we both looked up at it the bright circle flew across the sky and disappeared.  When that happened I yelled “oh my god was that a UFO?!” and my friend said “I don’t know what the heck that was.”  Ever since then it’s been in my mind.
