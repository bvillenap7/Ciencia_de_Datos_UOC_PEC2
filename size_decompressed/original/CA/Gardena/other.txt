I have been seeing small lights in the night sky sense the summer of 1997.This is going to sound crazy but they almost seem like they play hide & seek with me,popping out from behind a tree or pole & jumping back behind again. Like they know I'm looking at them. I have tried to show people but most can't see & laugh.Two others have been able to see them. Sometimes there are hundreds of them & other times 1 or 2. I don't know how far away they are.I have seen them following the power lines in my back yard, and also off in the distence & they always look the same, like a tiny dot of light. A lot of times I see them off to the west where  bright lights are lighting the sky. They shoot up & down quickly, and seem to hang around the lights till dawn. They sometimes look like they are following a plain that is flying past following behind it. They hang in the clouds when clouds are in the sky, and when there are no clouds they seem to form a type of cloud around them to hide in. I don't know what it is I have been seeing. I can't fig. it out. I hope you dont think I'm crazy or making this up. I just want to know what it is that I have been seeing for the past two years. If you have heard of anything like this please let me know what it might be.;33.8928727699529;-118.292207511737
