They seemed to be doing some type of arial exercise.  Then at 11:05am, a passenger plane that had just taken off from LAX, was making its turn around the So. Bay area, , when all five saucer craft left its current position and went after the plane.  I witnessed the passenger plane abruptly make a sharp turn and ascend to a higher altitude, when the craft began approaching the plane.  They followed the jet for @ 40 sec. and  returned to its original location.  On Sunday 07/08/01, at 6:00pm I was looking up at the sky when I noticed a bright object, that appeared to be as bright as a star,  I retreived my binoculars, and brought them into focus, and saw a Large triangular object, with lights under it which appeared to be changing color from an amber color to a fiery red, which could have be the suns reflection.  I continued observing the object to make sure it wasn't just mylar balloons, but the object remained stationary,  where as balloons will drift with the air current. ( There was a breeze that had also pick up in the early evening.)  I went in the house to get family members to witness this occurance,  and when spotting the object with the binoculars, I also then witnessed 5 additional craft , however these were saucer shaped, and were hovering also to the left of the large triangular object.  These craft were not moving for some time, aprrox. 1-1 1/2 hr. in the sky.;33.8928727699529;-118.292207511737
