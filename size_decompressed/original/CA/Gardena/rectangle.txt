I observed two stars to the southwest and one airplane possibly a commercial plane directly above me. I could tell it was an airplane because it had a blinking red light on the bottom and the wing lights were red and green. I then noticed more lights moving and observed an unidentified flying object crossing my field of vision from the south heading northwest. It was two pairs of amber lights flying at a seemingly slow pace. It would have had to be daylight to be sure but I am reasonably confident that the object was above the usual altitude for VFR flight but it seemed much closer and larger than a commercial aircraft which would place it somewhere between two and six thousand feet in my estimation. I have had some ground school and flight sim experience but not enough to identify altitudes at night confidently. The object increased in speed and flew off ! to the northwest.;33.8928727699529;-118.292207511737
