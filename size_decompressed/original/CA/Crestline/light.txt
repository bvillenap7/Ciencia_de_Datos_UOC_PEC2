My brother and I went to go see ther annual Crestline firework show. As the fireworks started, my brother pointed out a strange light that was circling around the lake very fast. Many must have seen this. It kept circling around the lake until the fireworks were over. It then suddenly split into 2 and went over the mountains at an incredible speed. I am just 13, so most people may not take me seriously. My brother is 21 and we know what we saw. The strangest part was when we were walking back to our cabin talking about the event. We overheard a man describing the exact same event that we were talking about.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));34.2423;-117.2748
Strange light circles over Lake Gregory fireworks show--Hundreds must have seen it. Light then splits in two.;2001-06-30 21:20:00;approx 10 min.;Strange light circles over Lake Gregory fireworks show--Hundreds must have seen it. Light then splits in two. Strange light circling during fireworks show over Lake Gregory area of Crestline, Ca. Show started a 21:00, I saw light at about 21:20 and thought it looked strange, no flashing lights, no sound heard, a white light moving fast. I was in a different location than my family, they said it circled about three times or so, and people were looking at it and saying it must be a stealth or an F-14. Some said it was a UFO and one nearby man timed it's wide circle at 3 min-40 sec. My wife said it headed about due West and split into two! Hundreds, maybe thousands of people must have seen this light. I think the fireworks show ended at 21:25. I may be off by 5 minutes or so. I was at 5100 ft. and it seemed to be low at about a 30 degree angle. Lake Gregory is at 4700'. I am a licensed medical person.;34.2423;-117.2748
Bright steady light was observed over Lake Gregory Forth of July celebrate.;2001-06-30 21:25:00;5 to 7 min;Bright steady light was observed over Lake Gregory Forth of July celebrate. Every year at Lake Gregory near Crest Line California they celebrate the Forth of July the weekend before the 4.  Thousands of people come to view the show.  I have friends that invited me up to view the annual event.  The streets of the high mountain community were crowded with thousands of people. The fire works started a little after 9:00.  At about 9:20 a bright steady light was observed moving at a rate that could not be explained.  There were no flashing lights that could be observed on the object.  It moved in form the west toward the east.  It then came back around to complete a circle around which the Fireworks where at the center.  As the fireworks were going off it made 3 or 4 more circles.  The first time it took about 1 min to complete the circle.  The circle it made was at least 10 mile across.  Which I figured it would have to be moving at about 1800 miles an hour to make the loop in 1 min.  It moved slower on the other times around taking about 1 Â½ min to make the trip.  As it completed the last circle it split into 2 objects and it looked like it dropped straight down without slowing.  At the bottom of the drop it merged back into 1 object.  It then moved off back in the direction it came from over the mountains. With as many people at this event someone must have video taped it.;34.2423;-117.2748
Several lights appear, multiply, then disappear in the span of one half hour.;2014-08-25 21:30:00;30 minutes;Several lights appear, multiply, then disappear in the span of one half hour. Driving home on state hwy 18, 21:30.  Looking south, noticed two very bright lights hovering above what seemed to be Corona CA.  I then stopped in a turnout and began to film for twenty five minutes.   The first two lights hovered next to each other for several minutes then each split into two lights.   Minutes later one pair disappeared, then for the next fifteen minutes one light would appear above and to the west from the first, and the lower light would disappear.   It is also important to note that the lights began at exactly 21:30, and ended at exactly 22:00.;34.2423;-117.2748
