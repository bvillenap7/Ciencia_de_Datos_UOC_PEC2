My husband and I took a back road drive up a ridge just north of Crestline, CA, one afternoon in late 1995. We parked, got out of the car and were viewing the surrounding area. Of a sudden, my husband called and pointed, “Come, look over there! It looks like that house is rising into the air.” I joined him in time to stand and watch a rectangle like a two-story house rise into the sky. It went slowly up and up until it seemed to be entering a current of air and then was carried along. At first it looked like a box and then it seemed to become a triangle and tumbled in different directions before becoming a sharper triangle and heading east . . .  moving faster than anything we had ever seen. The next day, we drove to the area in Crestline we thought was where “the house” had been, but found no unusual signs of such an event.  Our thought, at the time, was that it might be a government experiment and that it was probably headed for the Arizona desert. The diagram is one I felt compelled to record during art class in 2004.  We told family and friends, but no one else . . . not knowing who would want the report. I’m  happy to know you are sincerely keeping track and that I won’t be thought to be some crackpot!
