Small metallica white spherical craft in Southern California.;2008-03-15 14:00:00;5-10 minutes;Small metallica white spherical craft in Southern California. A lot of questions asked in your report form I was not sure how to answer so I will answer them in my report.  When I saw the craft it was sometime between one and two o’clock.   I was riding my skate board down the street to friends a house also I live in the mountains and on my street is an opening with a view of most of southern California from San Bernardino to the beach.  So as I was riding I stopped to look at the view for a little while when I saw a reflection of something in the mountains on the horizon kind of by the beach.  At first I thought it was the reflection of a car driving it was moving slow at this time. So I decided to watch it and try to figure out what it was at this time still thought it was a car until I saw it move off the mountain and it was in mid air.  When this happened, I thought oh maybe it’s a helicopter all I could see was a reflection still.   So I continued watching it when all of the sudden boom it shot from the beach to the bottom of Mount Wilson which from where it came from was about a 1 ½ hour to 2 hour trip in a car. When that happened I could see exactly what the craft looked like it was a sphere about half the size of a jet liner with a white metallic on it and a rectangular black door or something on the front.  All it did was go back and forth from where it came from to the bottom of the mountain and incredible speeds almost instantaneously after about 5 minutes of this it shot out over to the beach and disappeared over the horizon of the Pacific Ocean.  I never knew where to report this until now that’s why its taken me so long to report it happened! in 2008. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
