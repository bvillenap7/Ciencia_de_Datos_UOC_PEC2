unexplained lights in southern california;2009-10-28 21:30:00;3 hrs;unexplained lights in southern california at approximately 9:30 pm, my daughter and myself were on our deck looking at the stars as we do frequently, and noticed one extreemly bright light that mooved, more than a satellite would, and would turn so you could see the sides of it lit up.  I got out my binoculars, but they werent very strong ones, so it just seemed as a very bright light.  since it was getting late, I put my kids to be, then I took a bath.  at about midnight, I went back up on the deck, and that light moved about 3 feet froom where I sat, so I think that must have been a great distance up there to move.  and it did the same thing, move about 5 inches, then stay and rotate a little.  I got out a flashlight and flashed it a few times, then it would move closer again. ((NUFORC Note:  Time of sighting may be flawed.  PD));34.2423;-117.2748
