TRIANGLE SHAPED VEHICLE W/ LIGHTS BUZZING SOUND. 45 SECONDS 3/21/2011 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EVEN START, THIS THING HAS BEEN BOTHERING ME FOR ALMOST 13 YEARS,  I'M REALLY SCARED TO EVEN SAY ANYTHING.   I WENT FISHING WITH 2 GOOD FRIENDS AT SILVERWOOD LAKE IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, IT WAS ABOUT 11:30 AT NIGHT NO CLOUDS A SLIGHT BREEZE,  WE WERE DOWN AT THE NORTHERN END OF THE LAKE, SAME PLACE WE ALLWAYS WENT, I WENT UP TO MY CAR TO GET MORE FUEL FOR OUR LANTERNS , I HAD JUST OPENED MY TRUNK WHEN I HEARD A HUMMING SOUND , KIND OF LIKE AN ELECTRICAL BUZZ IS THE CLOSEST THING I CAN COMPARE IT TOO.  I FELT THE HAIRS STAND UP ALL OVER MY BODY AND WHAT FELT LIKE A WARM BREEZE COMING DOWN ON TOP OF MY HEAD ,  THAT'S WHEN I LOOKED UP AND SAW THIS TRIANGLE SHAPE MOVING ACROOS THE SKY ABOUT 200 FEET ABOVE ME.  IT HAD LIGHTS BUT I COULDNT MAKE OUT ANY LINES WHERE THE LIGHTS WERE ,  THERE WAS A GLOW COMING FROM THIS THING,  LOOK MAN ,  I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THE HELL THIS THING WAS , ALL I KNOW IS IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME. I'M NOT CRAZY I KNO! W WHAT I SAW,  IT WAS THERE FOR ABOUT 45 SECONDS THEN TOOK OFF, RIGHT BEFORE THAT MY FRIEND CAME UP THE HILL AND SAID, WHAT ((deleted)) WAS THAT ?   I NEED TO KNOW IF ANY OTHER SIGHTINGS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THAT AREA.;34.2423;-117.2748
