Silver disk seen above San Bernardino Valley (5 minutes).;2009-10-24 10:25:00;5 minutes;Silver disk seen above San Bernardino Valley (5 minutes). Saw silver disk in air above San Bernardino Valley while driving.  Object was stationary for 5 minutes before disappearing suddenly.  Couldn't explain it, but called UFO hotline to make a report (later declined).   Was visited by large man from out of town (6'5'', 250lbs) in local bar (never saw him before) same week.  Actually, no one ever saw him before.   At the time, I was living in the mountains and didn't visit town very often.  He bought me a drink and started asking me questions, referring to things that I'd only know about in my life.  It was creepy.;34.2423;-117.2748
