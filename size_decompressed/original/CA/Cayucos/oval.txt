On Thursday, December 30th.(7:29pm Pacific) I got out of my car & looked up toward the Southern sky. It was the clearest night I've seen in some time. This large, round, glowing light much larger than the space station or satelites I've see.  It moved faster across the sky than airforce jet I've seen. It would had flown close to Vandenburg airforce Base, Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, & then over Fort Hunter Ligget.  The large,SILENT, glowing orb stopped, swerved back & forth, the shot from its Northern direction, to a 90 degree change to go Northeast @ light speed. I mean, so fast it just blipped out in a second. So, To recap.  It came from the South moving fast to the North, then stopped, made a pengelemn back & forth action, then went into light, warp-speed to the Northeast.  The light seemed like it had a hugh or haze around it.  Plasma, maybe because of the speed.  I know of one other person, a woman bartender, who saw it from Cambria, 15 miles North of wh! ere I saw it.;35.4492;-120.8851
