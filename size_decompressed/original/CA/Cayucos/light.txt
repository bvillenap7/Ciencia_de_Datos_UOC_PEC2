Toward the NE, what looked like a falling star at first, instead of fizzling out, fluidly zig-zagged off into the distance.  3 more incidents in the same field of view followed within tbe next four minutes or so.  Each incident persisted only seconds, but the last three didn't appear to fall first, just swooped in large arcing zigzag motions.  Not dramatice, just looked like stars suddenly mobilized.  Interestingly, there were two visible planes in the sky, whose seeming sluggishness amplified the speed of these objects.

There was a group of 6 of us, the 2 of us that were sitting at the fire both saw the same thing at the same moment. The light of the fire drowned out any other stars and the clarity of the night sky. All of the sudden it looked like a shooting star but there was 4 perfectly aligned lights spaced all evenly, and they were bright, but perfect bright sphere lights unlike anything I have ever seen. These lights were significantly brighter than any star in the sky that night by a huge margin. The line of lights was above the horizon line of the Pacific Ocean and shot across a small portion of the sky and disappeared in mid air within a matter of a split second. We both looked at each other in disbelief of what we had just witnessed.;35.4492;-120.8851
