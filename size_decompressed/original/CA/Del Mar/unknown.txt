Woke up on my back paralyzed w/ my arms down at my sides. Never sleep on my back because i had nightmares as a kid if i did, and now i wonder why. I'm thinking i've injured my spine somehow sleeping.. I finally get my head up and theres this little blue character smirking at me. I'm fully panicked and struggle to get up but can't move. The sun is coming in the window and i can distinguish this from any dream state. I lay my head back down to get the umph to get myself up, and when i'm able to, he's gone. I had a vague impression sperm  had been taken. The greys are dime-a-dozen and i am very interested in being contacted by people w/ experiences or information about these little blue guys. Years later i read Communion and they are mentioned there.  .;32.9662;-117.2521
