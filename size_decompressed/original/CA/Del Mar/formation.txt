Line of orange lights that would go off, on and slowly floated rising and falling.;2000-04-01 19:00:00;10 minutes;Line of orange lights that would go off, on and slowly floated rising and falling Me and some friends were sitting on his back porch.  We were younger (about 12 years ago)  so we were all in the sixth and seventh grade.   We all looked out over the lagoon where the five freeway passes from del mar heights road to the del mar fairgrounds.  Over the east side of the freeway between via de la valle and lomas sante fe, there were a line of orange lights.  They were circular and were floating above a hill, which is where a golf course is and suburban neighborhood.   The lights were very calm.  No flashing or flickering or explosions.  They moved up and down.  Rising and falling at a slow speed. almost hovering up and down.   Almost like a light switch one of them went off and then two and then they would just re appear in the same spot, or maybe a bit higher or lower.  Then more came.  They increased and decreased until all eventually going out.  They all were in some sort of line. but would vary either higher or lower.   The lights were indefinately an orange color.   I have never seen anything like this happen ever again in my life.   All of us were just normal kids having a slumber party at my friends.
