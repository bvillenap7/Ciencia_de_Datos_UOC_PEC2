I was standing outside looking up in the sky watcking the snow flurries falling, while I was smoking a cigarette.  Durring this time I believe I saw a U.F.O. Like I said i was Looking up in the sky watchin the snow fall and during this time lightning flashed and I saw the sky light up except a large roundish area in the sky was like a large shadow, it was only seen for a second because i saw it when the lightning flashed but it looked to big to be a air plaine and to high up to be a shadow from a tree.  I didnt get a good enough look at it in 1 second to tell if it was a U.F.O. or not but it scarred me to the point where i literaly droped my cigarette and ran inside my cabin. i would consent to contact by email;34.1531;-116.9485
