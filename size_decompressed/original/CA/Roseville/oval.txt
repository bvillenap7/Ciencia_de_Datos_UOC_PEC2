Six oval-shaped objects sighted over Roseville, CA, changing formations.;2001-08-26 12:15:00;5 to 10 minutes;Six oval-shaped objects sighted over Roseville, CA, changing formations. My wife and I were driving west on Pleasant Grove Blvd., Roseville, CA, approaching Washington Blvd., when she sighted some objects coming toward us from behind and above a Chevron station located on the NW corner of the intersection.  At first, I thought the objects might be large birds, but as they neared, I could see no wings, nor did they seem to act like birds.  They were in a close group.  I turned left (south) on Washington Blvd., went one block, u-turned, and parked the car at Diamond Oaks Blvd. and Washington Blvd.  We both got out of the car and continued to observe the objects. There were six objects, all oval-shaped, no sound, and were maneuvering in various patterns, close to each other.  At the nearest point to us, they were approximately 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon, i.e., not directly overhead.  These objects moved under their own power and performed fascinating maneuvers.  For example, they formed three pairs in a loose triangular shape, they would move into straight lines, into a semi-circle, into two groups of three forming a 'delta wing', then move into a curve, etc.  Two or three times, the objects moved away from us, but then they would move in an arc, change from white to bright silver, and come back near us.  At one point, they reversed direction, but without performing a turn.  It was difficult to determine the size of the objects or their distance from us, but I had a strong feeling that binoculars would have been the perfect tool for studying these things, i.e., they were just slightly beyond my ability to see exact detail. As an experiment, my wife removed her sunglasses for a moment, and said that the objects could barely be discerned, as they matched the sky's background nearly perfectly.  But with sunglasses on, they were very discernable.  After five to ten minutes, the objects again formed into two groups of three in a delta shape, and I watched them as they rapidly moved in a north-east direction and vanished into the sky.  We got in the car and drove in the direction they were last moving, but they were gone. I have a B.S. in physics, and am a software engineer working in Roseville.
