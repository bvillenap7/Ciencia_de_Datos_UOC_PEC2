It hovered, made a bobbing motion and then faded away. I was standing in my back yard, I was facing east. The Light seemed to hover for a few moments, it made a bobbing motion, and it flared in and out couple of times. It faded in to a small light, about the size of a very distant aircraft navigational light, and appeared to leave at very high rate of speed to the north east.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
Bright light over I-80 East at Douglas. The light shot horizontally toward the East leaving a trail of light and disappeared.;2001-11-02 17:40:00;2 minutes;Bright light over I-80 East at Douglas. The light shot horizontally toward the East leaving a trail of light and disappeared. My daughter and I were travelling on I-80 East at approximately the Douglas Boulevard exit when we both noticed what we thought was a bright star in the night sky directly in our vision above the freeway.  The light was lower than an airplane would normally fly, and then the light shot horizontally away from us at a very high rate of speed heading East leaving a trail of light and disappeared.  When the light shot across the sky it resembled a cruise missle you would see on TV in Afghanistan, although at a much faster rate of speed.  My daughter and I both gasped at the sight, and then realized we had both seen an extraordinary sight.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
Witnessed two very bright lights to the south east of us, that just appeared out of nowhere.;2011-10-25 20:25:00;1 minute;While doing our nightly star gazing in our backyard, my wife, son and myself witnessed two very bright lights to the south east of us, that just appeared out of nowhere.  They were roughly 2000 feet in the air, about a hundred feet apart and very bright. While watching them, they both simultaneously began moving south east very abruptly, causing the lights to become dim and suddenly disappear.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
Thee orange light flying in triangle formation with fourth light behind.;2015-01-13 18:30:00;3 minutes;Thee orange light flying in triangle formation with fourth light behind. My husband,daughter were walking in our neighborhood.  We noticed 3 orange lights in triangle formation flying from southern sky towards us level.   At first they looked like helicopter lights.  However, as they neared us, one at a time each light headed straight up and disappeared.  4th light followed closely behind the three and like the first three, flew up and disappeared.   Lights did not blink and there was no sound.   Had enough time to discuss what we saw and disappointed that none of us had a cell phone to capture it!;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
Silent and slow moving orange lights in a loose group of 6-8 separate lights.;2015-03-20 21:00:00;5 minutes;Silent and slow moving orange lights in a loose group of 6-8 separate lights Deep orange lights, slow moving and glowy, at approximately the elevation of a helicopter, but I didn't hear any sounds, even though I was almost beneath them.   They appeared to move in their own trajectories, near each other but not coordinated, and there were at least 6-8 of them.  I was able to observe them for about five minutes, before they'd moved too far away for me to track.  Movement was generally southwest to northeast.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931

A star-like object moving slowly and eminating light downward and sideways then disappearing.;2017-02-14 06:20:00;2 minutes;A star-like object moving slowly and eminating light downward and sideways then disappearing. What appeared to be a star-like light caught my attention on the horizon while driving west bound on highway 80 leaving Roseville.  It looked as though it was shining a spotlight in a cone-like shape downward from the object, then sideways as it moved.   Suddenly the object was gone and it appeared it left behind a cloud or smoke where the light was.  It was too slow to be a shooting star or a meteor.  A helicopter was flying near it on the horizon giving context.  It did not appear to be a plane or another helicopter.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
Up to 15 white lights seen flying in a single file like formation over Roseville, Ca. at 5:30 a,m. on 2/09/20 going from north to south;2020-02-09 05:30:00;~5 minutes;Up to 15 white lights seen flying in a single file like formation over Roseville, Ca. at 5:30 a,m. on 2/09/20 going from north to south At approximately 5:30 a.m. my phone alarm went off because I forgot to turn it off from the previous day. I did not want to wake up at 5:30 on this morning the morning of Feb 09,2020. After turning my alarm off I went to go back to sleep I'm homeless by the way so I sleep under the stars every night now for about 10 years. So at the present time I am sleeping on the front porch of an insurance building. So I am afforded a fairly good view of the night sky. Well as I am trying to get back to sleep I notice what I thought was a fixed star, start to move in a southerly direction it was pretty high up at least as high as commercial airline traffic would be. Well as I'm watching this object that only I can make out is a single white light, it is joined by up to 10 other similar lights/objects? they were all moving off to the south from the north I lost count of them as the first ones I viewed were going out of my view but more were coming in from the north all in! a single file they all appeared to be equally spaced apart they made no noise or at least I couldn't hear any noises coming from them, there were no other colored lights, only a single white light. These objects were moving at a pretty good clip they were moving in a purposeful and intelligent fashion. I would say that there were at least 12 -15 of these things lights/objects. Because of the time of day 5:30 on a Sunday morning I thought it might be some sort of military maneuvers or something along those lines but if they were military aircraft(helicopters or planes) that many would give off some kind of running or operating noise. It is of important note that the weather conditions for that night were pretty clear not many clouds in the sky that night. My gut feeling told me that what I was observing was different. I grew up in the military and was use to seeing all kinds of Air Force jets, planes. I never saw anything like that before.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931

Two Light Orbs Appear for 5 Minutes in Night Sky;2020-12-31 21:15:00;5 minutes;Two Light Orbs Appear for 5 Minutes in Night Sky Count: 2  Shape: round orbs  Colors: both reddish/orangeish/ yellowish  Sounds from Orbs: silent  Light: the light glowed and emitted light rays from the center, and the center of the orb was the brightest part. The light did not twinkle, change color, or blink. The light faded and disappeared in plain sight after 5 minutes of viewing. The light did not reappear in any other direction even after watching for another 5 minutes. The fading was simple, as it was see through after it faded away into as the night sky.  Movement: The orbs did not make any quick movement from right, left, up or down. They simply traveled towards us in one direction.  Travel direction: they were traveling from the northwest direction coming towards us. They were separated by thumbs distance. When i extend my arm and raise my hand, use my thumb,and close 1 eye, the distance in between the two objects were a thumbs distance aka the distance between my wrist to my thumb nail.  Altitude:The 2 orbs were at different altitudes, one orb was about 45 degrees lower in altitude when compared to the higher altitude orb, and the lower altitude orb appeared to be furthest linear distance from us.  Linear distance from viewer: estimated to be between quarter mile to a mile.  Any obstructions: No. But there are 20' tall building and they did not obstruct the orbs. No trees were taller then the buildings.  Viewed: standing on the ground at around 100' elevation  Weather: clear night no sky cover no clouds. I could see other stars in the sky.  Fireworks: In CA people celebrate the east coast new year at 9:00pm so i could hear fireworks but i could not see them. There was no smog in the air from any of the fireworks i was hearing. i couldn't smell any smoke from fireworks either.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
