Orange-amber light hovering over Roseville, California.;2012-12-31 18:30:00;2 minutes;Orange-amber light hovering over Roseville, California On December 31st, 2012 around 6:30pm, my girlfriend and I were driving along Gibson Rd., in Roseville, California when she belted out, what the heck is that?  I immediately pulled the car over into a parking lot, and we proceeded to observe a somewhat amber-orange light, hovering in the northeast sky.  It seemed to be about 2-4 miles away, and had no flashing Iâ€™d lights.  It was moving very slow, and actually stopped, and hovered for a few seconds.  There were no clouds or overcast in the area, and many stars were visible in the background.  It also appeared to have a square look to it.  After about a minute and a half, the light dimmed fairly fast into the night  and disappeared.  Around 10pm later that night, we witnessed the same amber light, in the same area hovering again.  Although it disappeared really fast this time.  I managed to record 90 seconds of this light on my iphone.  I came to my own conclusion that this strange light could no way be from earth, by ! the way it was moving.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
Rectangle with 7 lights over California.;2014-08-11 22:03:00;8 seconds;Rectangle with 7 lights over California On the evening of 8/11/14, I witnessed a craft that was a perfect rectangle with seven lights in a row followed by an eighth light on one end.  This craft was followed by a smaller craft that was also a perfect rectangle with three lights.  It was flying north to south. I was outside trying to view the meteor shower despite there being a pretty full moon.    While I didn't spot any meteors, I did see this craft flying pretty fast.  My father told me that it could be the flying wing bomber flying from a nearby air force base.   I researched the flying wing and it was definitely not the right shape.  After researching more, I could not find any current aircraft like the one I saw.   This doesn't confirm that the craft was alien in origin however.  It could still be an experimental craft.  But I tend to believe that it was not of earth origin.  But that is only my opinion.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
