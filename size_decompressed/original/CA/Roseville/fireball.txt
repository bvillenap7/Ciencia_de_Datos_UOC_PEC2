It seemed to me at the time to look something like a missle, because of its long tail and immense speed.  Also, it did not seem to be as high an altitude as I have seen meteors in the past.  Listening to the Art Bell discussion about this subject, I decided to response.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931

3-4 shape-shifting, orange orbs, witnessed in the night sky of Northern California.;2015-03-07 20:10:00;7 minutes;3-4 shape-shifting, orange orbs, witnessed in the night sky of Northern California. While taking my dog outside to relieve himself, I noticed a formation of three orbs appearing slightly above the rooftops of my condominiums at approximately 8:10pm Saturday, March 8th, 2015.   At first, the orbs appeared as if hovering in perfect triangular proximity of each other for a few moments, before I ran upstairs to grab my wife and prove I wasnâ€™t insane.  By the time we ran back outside the bottom two orbs were gone and only the apexed craft was remaining.  After a few minutes of watching it hover, it pulsated a few times before slowly shrinking and disappearing completely in the same place it had been. Amazed at what we had just witnessed, we remained transfixed and kept watching the sky, before another fireball orb rose before us again much lower in the sky, albeit without two other crafts accompanying it, and floated around much in the same manner as the crafts before but moved more, beginning to rise in a slow arch to the right and growing like ball of fire and then moving upwards to the same place the triangle had been before.   Although it was hard to turn away I realized it was imperative to document the sighting so I managed to run back in our house to grab our camera and catch a few of the last moments of it on tape.  This object, however brighter and slightly bigger, was almost dancing in the air gracefully just before pulsating a number of times and disappearing as the others did slowly as though almost shrinking out of existence.  Each orb looked glowing orange like a ball of fire but quickly became a smaller more defined sphere of bright light-a shapeshifter of sort! s.  On the video the shape appears to shift from pink to yellow however to the naked eye it appears completely orange or white. This was not the first time that I had seen something like this in my area, but it was the first time I was able to find somebody to witness my findings leading me to believe that there might be more out there then we think.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
