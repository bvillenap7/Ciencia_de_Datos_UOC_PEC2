Black, boomerang-shaped tube rotating high over Roseville, CA;2001-10-27 18:00:00;1/2 hour;Black, boomerang-shaped tube rotating high over Roseville, CA Carving pumpkins in our backyard on 10/27/01, 3 freinds and I looked to the west and saw a black, tubular, boomerang-shaped object high in the sky.  At first we thought it might be a string of balloons, but the the object was definitely of a set shape. It remained stationary, slowly rotating on the horizontal plane and drifting extremely slowly to the west, all the time rotating horizontally and keeping its shape.  We tried to look at it through a telescopic lense on a camera, but got no better resolution than with unaided eyes.  An airplane flew low beneath it and seemed not to acknowledge it.  It was too high to be a kite.  It was noiseless.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
