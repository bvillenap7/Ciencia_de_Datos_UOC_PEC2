UFO over Sacramento, V formation or a single object;2006-04-30 22:40:00;5 Seconds;UFO over sacramento, V formation or a single object Tonight I saw a formation of 5 craft in a V formation or a single craft.  It was really moving...mach 20 minimum.  Just flew over very quickly.   I've been watching the sky for 30 years to see something like this.  It was awesome, no sound, perfect formation, simply unreal.  I hope someone else in the Sacamento area saw this as I want some verification.  I'm so stoked right now.   UFOs do exist, whether they're ours or from another world!!!!;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931

Orange Orb was silent and not moving until the glow went out, then the object moved straight up into the sky before disappearing.;2012-10-29 20:00:00;5 minutes;Orange Orb was silent and not moving until the glow went out, then the object moved straight up into the sky before disappearing. My husband and I were driving home after having dinner out and were just getting ready to turn into our neighborhood. Before we turned south, we both looked up in the sky in front of us and saw a bright orange glowing object.  My dad was a pilot for years and I have always watched traffic in the skies but this was like nothing I’ve ever seen.  It made no noise and didn’t appear to be moving. I felt that it was relatively low in the sky which is what got my attention, if it had been a plane, I would think it would have been too low to be over the city. There were no other lights or colors, only the round bright glow of orange. My husband, immediately made a U-Turn on the road and parked so that we could get a better look. In most cases, if I see something he just keeps driving but this time his U-Turn was without hesitation. I immediately got out of the car and tried to take a picture with my cell phone but before I could get ready to take a picture, the bright orange glow disappeared, like a candle being put out… the light was gone, but we were both certain that we could still see a round shadow of the object. Within seconds of its light going out, we both watched it move straight up into the sky in a squiggly line until it disappeared, all in a matter of seconds. Both of us know that we saw something that was not human in any way. After searching on the internet for explanation, I’ve found other stories and some videos that describe the same thing we saw with pictures of exactly what we saw. I had no way to describe what we saw until I saw them described as orange orbs… I’ve never, in 50 some years, used the word ‘orb’ to describe something but it is the best word and the only way I can explain our event. Fascinating:  I feel very lucky to have witnessed this and hope that someday I find out what it was.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
Two very slow moving stars seen well past sunrise.;2013-11-01 07:30:00;2.5 hours;Two very slow moving stars seen well past sunrise. Two bright objects, originally thought to be stars or planets, still bright in sky at sunrise. They were located about 15 degrees North of directly overhead about 20 degrees apart from each other.  No other stars visible.   Stars move from East to West in the sky as the Earth rotates.  These objects slowly moved toward the East throughout the morning.   At the time of this report the Eastern object is no longer visible but the Western object is still quite clear.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
