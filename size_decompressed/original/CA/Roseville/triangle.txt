V shaped object sighted in nightsky on 2000 U.S presidential election date;2000-11-07 22:00:00;15 seconds;V shaped object sighted in nightsky on 2000 U.S presidential election date It was the election night of Bush V. Gore and I had an argument with my parents. I left the house to cool off outside in the backyard. I was facing north at the time and it was night. We live in a populated neighborhood so there were rooftops obstructing a clear view of the horizon. I was standing there looking at the sky and I had to do a double-take because something strange seemed to just appear out of nowhere. There were 7 orbs in a V pattern (the V on its side) gliding downwards from the sky. I didn't see anything but orbs, no body, no ship, just orbs flying in a specific pattern. Each orb were striped and tri-colored: blue, yellow, pink'ish red. It was closer than any plane I have ever seen and it was dead silent. I felt an intense feeling of bewilderment and even fear. It was nothing like I had ever seen before. My dad then came out of the house but as I was calling for him to come see, the orbs had already disappeared behind the rooftops.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931

Triangle shape traveling at extreme speed across the night sky, no noise at all.;2003-08-25 21:45:00;1-5 sec;Triangle shape traveling at extreme speed across the night sky, no noise at all. I was sitting in my backyard looking up at the night sky. Very light patches of cloud cover but mostly a good clear view of stars. I was looking toward the north and I caught site of what I thought was a shooting star traveling southwest to northeast. When I first observed the UFO it was directly overhead heading towards the northeast. It was a triangle shape with red lights on each point of the triangle. They were not flashing or very bright, just a constant red glow that defined the very distinct black triangle shape. The was no noise whatsoever. The speed would be compared to a shooting star. I was only able to view the object for a few seconds because of the extreme speed it cross the sky. The only thing I am not clear about is if it rotated slightly, not spinning but a slight rotation. My impression is controled flight. I do not know the size because I have no reference, but I felt I was at a very high altitude.  I am not a professional observer, however I know what a plane and helicopter look like, I have seen satelites many times. I have even seen the space shuttle when it was docking with the space station. I thought possibly it might be a military fighter but because of the speed, shape and absence of any noise leads me to believe otherwise.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931

It only happened minutes ago, and while I have seen what I thought was a UFO, this is the only that has scared me to death.  I feel very scared because it was flying very low, probably at about 1000 feet. Minutes later a light beam crossed the sky in the other direction.
