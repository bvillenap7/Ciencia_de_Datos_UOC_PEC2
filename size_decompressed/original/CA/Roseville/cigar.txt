One cigar-shaped, silver craft.  Stationary, high above a popular week-end open market (Denio's) held near downtown Roseville.  My husband and I were driving eastbound on I-80 and pulled off into a shopping center to better observe the craft.  After another minute or so, it just disappeared from the sky.

He was a heavy equipment operator for the City of Sacramento and I was an analyst for the State of Calif.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
