Observed from Roseville, Ca. and Sierra Nevada mountains,;1998-07-01 00:00:00;15 min.;Observed from Roseville, Ca. and Sierra Nevada mountains, I have seen 2 ufo’s.  the first,  when my twins were about 8.  They are now 21.  I lived in an apartment complex in Roseville, Ca.  We were swimming in a pool during July.  It was very hot and the wind was blowing from the north.  I was talking to a couple at the jacoozie when one of the twins said “What is that Dad?”  I looked and at about 500 ft. was a perfectly round ball, painted black, with a hint of green.  It was going north, against the wind, keeping the same altitude.  I suspected it might be military, as it was going the direction of Beal Air Base, up by Marysvlle, Ca.  My second sighting was 2 years later.  I had driven up to the Sierra’s for a picknick with a lady friend.  I went up almost to Borial Ski Center, then north about 20 miles to a small lake I knew about.  After lunch, while enjoying the senery, I was watching Comercial Jets going north on a Jet Way.  I am a GA Pilot and know about this.  I could easily see the planes. After a short time, a silver (plane?) looking like a cigar holder came flying north, also on the J Way.  It had NO wings, propellars, tail, or Jet streem.  It was just like a cigar holder in silver. I think, because of using the Jet way, it must have been Military.  I don’t know about either though.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931

As we approached I-80 heading;2000-10-31 16:30:00;one minute;Around Halloween my two daughters and I were driving home from work on Atlantic Street in Roseville, CA.  As we approached I-80 heading South I noticed two small white objects flying in and out of a large thunderhead that had formed to the south east of the city.  I thought they were starnge and kept watching them. They would fly into the cloud, and then fly out.  At first I thought they were gulls.  I realized that they were way to big to be gulls, and had never seen a gull at that altitude (the objects were 1/2 way up vertically from the bottom to the top of the thunder cloud).  They were also moving very quickly (I can't guess how fast). I pointed them out to my daughters.  My 12 year old didn't have her glasses on so she didn't see them.  My 8 year old saw them clearly and expressed astonishment. We continued on Atlantic Street and then entered I-80 heading East.  I lst sight of them then. The whole incident lasted approximately 1 minute. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
Abduction, middle of night, out of 2nd story bedroom.;2004-05-05 01:00:00;hours;Abduction, middle of night, out of 2nd story bedroom. Sometime between May 03 and September 03 I had the experience. I awoke outside, bedroom on 2nd floor – walking barefoot and feeling the grass under my feet.  Next to my right arm was a ‘smaller figure’ I am not looking, but sense being directed.  It directs me toward a wooden fence, as we walk closer I see a metal ladder and a push on my arm.  I start climbing up.  I remember being confused and wondering how come I am climbing ‘up’ against a property line fence. I step-up at least 4 steps up to a small metal standing space, the area is a little smaller than a manhole cover.  I am very aware of how smooth the metal is and put my right hand onto a railing to stabilize myself. As I do, I am directed to step down into a darkened hole, I am not afraid.  Descending, I see 4 metal tub sitting bench circulating this 7-8 feet across small room.  Climbing down, I glance just below steps and see a blond man,  I do not look at him again.  There is one other person a brown-haired lady, she does have clothing on (I presume night ware).  I am only wearing panties I realize my modesty, briefly hesitating I am pushed to sit down.  After sitting down, placing my feet on the metal floor it was wet/water to my bare feet. I am now able to see a round bubble-out window, I have sat down (to my right) across from the other lady.  I have no thoughts of how come I am here, or the smaller figure to my right next to the window. No panic up to this point, complete acceptance. My next thought is us traveling above a freeway, very fast with a slight movement, but not a noticeable wobble.  I have stood up a little and bending slightly at the waist to look squarely out the window.  I am not stopped (?) thinking back that is strange.  I am surprised to see how light it is outside, as I remember thinking it was not morning yet.   I see an over-pass coming up quickly and voice out that we are going to crash into it.  I am more afraid of the possibility of crashing than I am in a tight-enclosed vehicle going very fast.  I turn to look at the smaller figure to my right and yell at him we can’t go through cement!  I hear a voice (but it is in my head) from behind me saying, “Quiet that one down.” I feel like I have fallen next to the brown-haired lady a surprised yelp from her and seeing we have come and connected with the bottom part of the over-pass everything goes black. I awakened the next morning and did not start thinking about that night for a few weeks, and since then questioned if that was a vivid dream or an event.  My husband is completely unaware of the events as described.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931

Kind of what a police cars lights look from far away. Tonite we saw 2 more. The lights seem stationary but with binoculars you can see they are a cluster of small round lights swirling around.  I live only minutes from Sacramento. I will keep everyone informed if they continue.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931

I thought it was an airplane at first but the object stayed in the same area for a ong time in the sky. I was driving at that time so I parked my car and made a clearer view of the object.

When we got closer we could see a round shaped object with a string of lights circulating around it. The movements was like Waves. It didn't have any noise or sound, very quiet. It was moving very very fast. I n just few seconds it changed it's position from Roseville to the South Sacramento maybe, it was very far. we were driving in Interstate-80 twards Sacramento, and we saw it exactly where Highway 65 merges I-80. It happened so fast, I couldn't take a picture of it with my mobile. This time my husband was with me, so I have a withness. I have seen an object twice before in the same area and anytime I wanted ton take a picture it just disappeared very fast.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
Bright White Light Sitting in a Northern Ca. Sky;2011-02-05 17:30:00;2 minutes;Bright White Light Sitting in a Northern Ca. Sky My children and I stopped at an intersection while driving and I noticed a bright white light in circle form up in the sky.  It was still daylight out and there were some clouds but otherwise a beautiful early evening approx. around 530 pm.  I had a video camera in the vehicle right next to me so I grabbed it and started to film the bright light that was just sitting in the sky..to me it didn't seem to move at all, but my daughter thought it might of been moving upwards a bit. I video taped the object and after handing over the camera to my daughter because the intersection light turned green she filmed it a bit longer and then the camera ran out of space.  A bit after the camera ran out of space the bright white circle light suddenly disapeared.  It was nothing ordinary in our eyes..it was not a plane or anything of the like.  It was a ufo.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
Bright Orange balls of light in the sky.  Stayed in one place for a few minutes then began moving North until they disappeared.;2013-11-13 21:15:00;10 minutes;Bright Orange balls of light in the sky.  Stayed in one place for a few minutes then began moving North until they disappeared. My wife, son, daughter and I witnessed.  We are just a normal working family.  Saw a large bright orange light standing still towards the North.  Was about 2x the size of Venus at its brightest.   First thought it was a planet although not in a normal location and obviously not the same color and I called my family out to see.   Then a second slightly larger one flew in from East to West at a slightly downward angle about the same speed as an airplane and then stopped in the same area as the first one.   They stayed still for a little and then one at a time, began moving North and disappeared.   We went back inside for a minute and looked again and there were 4 more in roughly the same area.  They remained still for a while and then repeated the same Northern pattern as the first 2.   There was no noise whatsoever and the lights were solid-non blinking.  They looked just like images we found on the internet after we came back inside (some pictures in the UK).   Watched for another 30 minutes and none returned.    These were not any aircraft that I've ever seen.   Any explanation?;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
Large Fleet of UFO's observed over Roseville, CA.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the objects are birds, perhaps seagulls.  PD));2019-02-03 16:35:00;10 minutes;Large Fleet of UFO's observed over Roseville, CA. On the above indicated date and time, I was walking my dog in our neighborhood.  I looked above the tree lines in the East and observed what I first thought was a grouping of birds flying North to South.  There were approx. 50-60 objects.  The objects were not flying in formation and were spread out high and low, some were swirling about the others.  Many of the objects in the lead would actually reverse direction and join those trailing behind.   One object was observed diving at a very high right of speed, stopping, making a 180 degree turn upwards and disappearing in a cloud above it. Not knowing the size of the objects it was difficult for me to judge their distance.  I would make a guess of anywhere between a half mile and three quarters mile in distance from my location. My eyesight is very good and I was able to see that the objects did not flap wings as a bird would.  Secondly, the sun would strike some of the objects and I could see that they appeared to be silver in color. I had my I-Phone 8 with me and began taking a video.  I took 4 videos in total. I continued watching and observed that the objects continued in a southerly direction and were almost directly above downtown Roseville. The objects continued their swirling gyrations and after a couple of minutes were lost to sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the objects are birds, perhaps seagulls, seen running ahead of a developing storm.  The witness is going to consult a photoanalyst to see what his impression of the video might be.  PD));38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
