At around 2:00 am this morning (August 11th) I was laying on the ground outside watching the annual meteor shower that goes on this time of year.  Then I noticed a moving orange mass that looked like a cloud at first.  When I looked closer I noticed it was it was five or six orange circles that were in the shape of a dividing rod (one straight end with two ends diagonally coming out of it.  It was being led by the two diagonal ends.  Here is an illustration. The blue arrow indicates which direction it was heading in.   I was facing East and the object was heading West, right in my direction. http://s88311880.onlinehome.us/pics/UFO1.jpg  It got out of my line of vision, so I got up and ran until I could see it again.  I saw it for another couple of seconds until it disappeard over the horizon of my house.   I scanned the sky everywhere trying to look for it again.  Then, from a completely different direction (North),  I saw another moving mass of about six circular orange lights.  This time they were in the shape of an arc, as illustrated here: http://s88311880.onlinehome.us/pics/UFO2.jpg Once again, it was moving in the direction of the blue arrow from the angle I saw it (Me facing North, the object heading West - Northwest.)  As it moved more to the left,  the lights got closer together like this: http://s88311880.onlinehome.us/pics/UFO3.jpg  This mass of lights stayed in my line of vision for a good twenty seconds before disappearing over the horizon.  Both objects didn't make any noise from what I could tell.  Before the sighting I was quite relaxed just laying back watching for the occasional shooting star to send a white streak across the sky.  (By the way, I am 100% sure this was not a shooting star or anything like it.)  When I saw the first one shaped like the dividing rod,  I was confused.  I knew it wasn't a star or any type of airplane that I've ever seen. It also didn't appear to be a light show produced by a machine or anything.   After I realized that it wasn't a normal object in the sky, I was shocked.  That's why I ran around looking to see if I could find it again.  When I saw the second arc-shaped one I was even more shocked because it was completely different than the first one, so I figured it was a completely different entity than the first one.  The lights were the same reddish-orange color as the first one.  In both instances, the orbs were moving faster than an airplane or jet.  They weren't moving extraordinarily fast,  but definetly faster than any airplane I have ever seen.  Now, I don't really believe in aliens or extraterrestrials.  Normally when I see someone talking about a UFO sighting,  I figure they were either intoxicated or saw an ordinary object (like a plane or light show) and misconstrued it as being foreign.  So for me to actually see something that *I* couldn't identify as something you'd normally see in the sky,  I'm just in shock and disbelief.   I keep thinking I'm not one of those crackpots.  But I know I saw *something* up there.  Something strange.  I'm sure there is some logical, Earthly explanation for it.  But I can't for the life of me figure out what it is.  My best bet is that maybe they were some military planes that aren't really known to the public.  But if they were, they sure had a strange flight pattern.  I hope I was thorough enough in my explanation.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
3-15 lights with iridescent (rainbow-colored) tails coiling and whipping from glowing center  into 'symbol' like shapes.;2016-09-27 01:42:00;12 minutes;3-15 lights with iridescent (rainbow-colored) tails coiling and whipping from glowing center  into 'symbol' like shapes. I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night, then went back to bed.  I was facing the bedroom window (westward pointing).  I saw a really bright twinkling light in the sky but, I knew it wasn't a planet.  It twinkle so wildly it gave the illusion of moving but, not across a trajectory.  I saw and photographed something like this before JAN 2014: https://goo.gl/photos/ngv9AMW6zQNfj2mX8).   So I ran downstairs and grabbed my camera gear an proceeded to take photos. I took these shots early this morning 1:42-1:54am 09-27-16, facing west approximately 25-30 degrees from horizon line:   https://goo.gl/photos/qLddXwnp1iqMmqNt5   If you click on the link there are a series of images I took.  The strange thing is that there were 3 of these 'light/plasma anomalies in the sky last night.  And they seemed to be synchronized with each other!  All images taken using standard astro photography protocol & settings to prevent any movement of the camera : -tripod -trigger release -lens on eyepiece closed off -settings: iso 1600 - 6 - f2.8   I've also reported this incident to Linda Moulton Howe.  Apparently, others have actually seen the same thing in 2008 & 2010.  My original sighting was in Jan 2014 and now, here again, in Sep 2016. What are these?!  And, why are there multiples now?  I be be happy to provide the original camera raw files if needed.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
