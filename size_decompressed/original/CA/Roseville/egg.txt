There were three crafts total, they were oval/egg shapped, bronze in color with a glowing featured on thier underbelly. Although it was dark, it was easy to identify that these were well defined shapes, which moved with percision and stopped very fast.  Hovered over head approximately 100 feet up for approximately 3 minutes accompanied by a light humming sound with a vibrating sensation.  A bright and warm beam of light then moved up and down my body as if examining me for approximately 30 seconds. One craft then left at a slow rate of climb and stopped at a point higher in the sky. At this pouint a large gush of hot wind/air poured down on me and another craft left the area flying out of sight. The final craft came lower to my area within about 35-50 feet of my head, sat there for about a minute or two then slowly rose to the position of the first craft - they both then departed the sky at a high rate of climb, so fast it created a blur in my vision. Upon my return home, I began suffereing from intense heade aches and joint sorness. After trip to the urgent care center, they discovered multiple small burn type injurins to the top of my head and shoulders. After telling them of my experience, they referred me to my primary care physician and did not take me serious. I have had a very hard time sleeping ever since this happened, but also find that I only sleep a few hours a night and am not tired at all - or hungry. I am baffled and terrified.;38.7599182758621;-121.303024137931
