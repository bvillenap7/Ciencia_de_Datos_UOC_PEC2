Bright orange light seen over Southern California.;2013-03-03 20:00:00;1 minute;Bright orange light seen over Southern California On Sunday, March 3, 2013, at around 8pm, my mom and I were in her car in a parking lot.  We had just gotten back inside our car, when I spotted the light in the sky. It was a diamond-shaped object, bright orange/yellow in color, and as it moved across the sky, and as we watched, it slowly began to fade in intensity, and then seem to disappear altogether.  We did not see anything else in the sky at this time not anymore of these objects, nor any aircraft.  And as far as we could tell, it was not making any sound.  It moved in one straight horizontal line. By the time I thought about filming it with my phone, it had already begun to fade, and I couldn’t see it through my phone’s screen.  The entire sighting lasted anywhere between 45 seconds to one minute. We know it wasn’t an airplane, helicopter, or other aircraft that we are familiar with.  None of them have lights as bright as this one, nor lights in that shape and color. I had never seen anything like it before, and I will definitely let you know if I see any more of them again.;33.7353393939394;-118.299103787879
