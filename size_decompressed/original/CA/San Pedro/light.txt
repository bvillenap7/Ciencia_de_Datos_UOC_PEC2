This was a night sighting in a backyard in San Pedro CA., at the Los Angeles Harbor and Cabrillo Beach area.  A small light in space that looked like a faint star was just south east of being over head.  At first it was stationary, but then started to move in a perfectly straight line for a few seconds(if you hold your thumb out at arms length the distance moved would be about 2 thumbs width), then instantly changed direction in exactly 80 degrees from its previous course and again went perfectly straight for a few seconds traveling the same distance, then once more instantly changing direction 80 degrees from its previous course. It moved back to it's original location then a few second later took off like a shooting star torwards the horizon.  The were no obstructions overhead such as clouds, electrical wires, or planes.

The flash lasted only a few seconds, it was a light blue color and was very bright.   The light was bright enough to light up a huge portion of the sky, very interested to see if anyone else saw the same thing and possibly have details I was not able to see.;33.7353393939394;-118.299103787879

Shooting star like Object darting around sky in the shape of a fishing hook.;2019-10-31 06:18:00;1 second;Shooting star like Object darting around sky in the shape of a fishing hook. I was take photos of the sunrise facing east. I had my camera set up on a tripod doing long/multiple exposures. I was looking south to see if the boats (container ships) on the horizon line are moving or staying still. Just above the horizon a light caught my eye. At first it looked like a shooting star, it appeared to be moving at a 45ยบ angle to the horizon, with a slight downward arc. When it was just above the horizon it darted up and then made a movement in the shape of a fish hook as it disappeared. It was about 3 to 5 times the thickness of a shooting star. About 5 to 7 times brighter than a plane but moved about 10x faster than a plane. The object did not reflect on the ocean and did get dimmer as it approached the horizon as to appear outside the earths atmosphere.  The entire even happen in less than a second. As I saw it I put my hand on my phone in my pocket, by that time it was over.;33.7353393939394;-118.299103787879
