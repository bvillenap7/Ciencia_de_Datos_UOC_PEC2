Floating shade above an old base on the ocean in San Pedro.;2021-06-04 17:56:00;3 minutes;Floating shade above an old base on the ocean in San Pedro. I was walking my dog along the ocean in the Point Fermin area heading SW on paseo Del Mar. Across the street is an old base, the Korean Friendship Bell and a large dog park.  The base and bell are on the top of that large hill. The conditions were sunny, golden hour light, with some clouds in the sky over the ocean behind me with clear skies in the direction of the UAP. Im a photographer so I had my camera with 50mm-250mm lens. I was looking toward the park deciding if I was going to take my dog there or to another park just ahead.  When I looked at the park, I noticed what looked like a falling craft or debris, with what looked like streaks from a fast falling object.  I noticed it was floating, not falling. After about a minute, I took out my camera to shoot some photos.  Around that time the object floated away from me, heading NW towards rancho palos verde.  I walked down the street to keep eye contact on it until it went past the tree line and was no longer in view.  The entire event was 2-3 minutes in length. There was no sound. At its closest it was maybe 100-150 yards away. There was a helicopter in the vicinity about a mile away over the ocean;33.7353393939394;-118.299103787879
