It looked like the shape of a Tylenol pill.  No lights or noticeable marks on it.   Before I could show someone the marine layer of clouds were moving towards shore and began to hide the object.  It made no sounds but I'll always wonder what it was I saw that night.;33.7353393939394;-118.299103787879
Black oval moving without lights in the night sky.;2000-07-01 11:45:00;10-15 seconds;Black oval moving without lights in the night sky. I was sitting in my patio when I observed what I first thought was a small dark cloud moving across the sky. I realized it was moving much to fast to be a clound and it had no running lights of any kind, which I thought was strange. I ran into my house and got a pair of binoculars, and raced back outside. I located and observed the object for about 5 to 7 seconds before I lost sight. It was an oblong oval shaped object, greater in height then width, black or dark gray in color, and at first I thought it might be a hot air balloon, but then I realized the shape was wrong because it was  symetrical about the horizontal axis and it was moving very fast, at least with the velocity of an aircraft. I thought I could make out vertical lines running down the side, but this impression was formed just as I was losing site. It was moving North to South across the LA Harbor area. Latitude 33.943182 Longitude -118.408042 (MapBlast). I called the LA Harbor Division Police department and at the time I called, no one else had reported see it.

multiple UFO sightings over San Pedro, CA.;2005-03-14 20:30:00;5 - 6 seconds;multiple UFO sightings over San Pedro, CA. I live in San Pedro, CA around 3rd and Gaffey up from the harbor. Last night I was standing on my back porch which faces in a westerly direction. I was making a crude star chart to research and i.d. some of the constellations I could see. It was a beautiful, clear night with a few small clouds and a nice crescent moon. I was fairly intent on the sky trying to make sure I got the major stars in their proper position. The time is approximately 8:30 PM. As I’m looking up I see off to my right 2 glowing orbs moving directly together at what had to be a high rate of speed. They were moving in a very straight line in a generally south west direction side by side, closely together. Their path from horizon to horizon took maybe 4 to 5 seconds and then they, for a lack of better words, disappeared. The objects appeared to be glowing and were orange in color. If I had to guess at their size from my viewpoint, I’d say about the size of dimes, maybe more oval than perfectly round. I have an amateurs interest in astronomy and have done lots of star gazing over the years. I’ve seen meteor showers, comets, missile launches, etc. This was like none of those. After they passed, I was a little shaken, not quite sure what I had just seen. I walked back in and called a friend. I had to share this with someone! After I got off the phone I walked back out and was staring to the skies, a little stunned. After about 5 minutes (approx. 8:45) to my amazement I see another group of those glowing lights, this one containing a fairly tight cluster of maybe 5. These were higher and looked a lot smaller. These were moving  in a more westerly direction and their passage lasted maybe 3 seconds. These appeared to be flying higher or further away, so I couldn’t comment on shape, but they definitely had that same orange glow. I go back in call my friend again. I come back out and continue to stare at the skies in amazement. I guess about 10-15 minutes later, (around 9:00) I see one more cluster, maybe 6 or 7 of this time, moving at about the same position and direction as the second cluster. I continued to scan the sky for maybe 20 minutes more, but didn’t see anything else after that. I went in and made some notes and drew a picture of what I saw on the “star chart” I was making. I’ve been checking the news and the internet, hoping to find something that would explain this sighting, but haven’t seen anything other than similar sightings from different times in the past. I called the local police station to see if possibly there were other reports or info. they might have. They directed me to call NASA, which I haven’t done but may. I was really hoping there would be a logical explanation for this incident, but haven’t found it yet. Any help, comments or collaboration anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.;33.7353393939394;-118.299103787879
Oval cylindrical shaped object  Bottom was red and rest was white.;2007-02-26 15:48:00;30 seconds;Oval cylindrical shaped object  Bottom was red and rest was white. I was outside talking to my friend when I noticed a bright orange object flying from the Northwest.  As it traveled I realized that it was orange cause of the reflection of the sun.  But it still looked a little odd.   So I yelled for my wife to bring out the binoculars when looking through the binoculars I Noticed that it was red on the bottom and it had no wings like a plane.   With Closer observation it looked like the object was gliding instead of flying.  My friend and my wife looked through the binoculars and described seeing the same thing.  If I was to describe the shape I would say it was between oval and a cylindrical shape.  If anyone has any idea what this was please let me know.
