Brilliant white sphere in front of a glowing crescent that traveled above the LA Harbor.  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch.  PD));2017-09-23 22:50:00;1 minute;A brilliant white sphere in front of a glowing crescent that traveled above the Los Angeles Habor area at night on 9/23/17. A fireball or bright sphere crossed overhead from NW to SW for about 1 minute. There was a crescent shaped glow many times larger that followed  the sphere.  The sphere was in the middle and on the leading edge of this glowing crescent. The speed of travel was much slower than a meteor and seemed to be far higher than the passenger jets that are regularly seen to follow a west to east flight path to LAX.  No aircraft were in sight when this incident occurred. After viewing the sphere for approximately 45 sec to 1 min, it had traveled to approximately 30 degrees above the SW horizon and then disappeared completely. I observed the sphere through 20x binoculars and it did not appear to have any vapor trail or disintegration occurring as it traveled. The crescent shape appeared to be uniform and fluorescent without ragged trailing. Both the sphere and crescent were emitting a brilliant white light during the entire event without diminishing intensity. ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Vandenberg AFB.
