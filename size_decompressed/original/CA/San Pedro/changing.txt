I noticed immediately a strange ball of lights that changed various colors about 40 feet from my bedroom window it was almost so close, enough for me to see it's round sphere like shape. I know it noticed me because it flew so fast that I just grabbed my phone to record. Almost a full 45 minutes  it was in the area going from one spot to another and then disappearing  and the crazy thing is  know it was a UFO. I know there are no man made space craft that when going invisible, turn the color Burgundy. I have many pieces of video footage from close up zoomed in video footage of it and am hesitant to upload on social media. The colors it changed was beautiful. While everyone was at home and enjoying Christmas, I was recording something super cool!!!;33.7353393939394;-118.299103787879
