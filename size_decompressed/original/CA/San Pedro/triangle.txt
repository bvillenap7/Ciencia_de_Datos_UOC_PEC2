Golden Fire Pyramids over San Pedro and Palos Verdes, CA - 4 July 2011;2011-07-04 23:45:00;20 minutes;Golden Fire Pyramids over San Pedro and Palos Verdes, CA - 4 July 2011 Two large unknown objects ascended through the night sky off the coast of Palos Verdes, California around 23:45 on 4 July 2011. Our party of four had just finished watching the fireworks display in the southeast night sky over Long Beach, Ca from our backyard patio. A few minutes had passed when our attention was diverted to the southwest portion of the sky. Given that it was the Fourth of July, we merely thought it to be a floating lantern, or possibly a large flare someone shot up off the coast. It appeared to be rising from somewhere between the southwest tip of the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Catalina Island and we were able to calculate that it was rising over White’s Point, San Pedro - on the Pacific Coast (roughly lat:33°42'42.78&quotN, lon:118°19'7.09&quotW). Expecting it to explode like the fireworks cascading the night sky did throughout the day and night, we watched it intently with anticipation.  We believied it to be one final spectacular display since the major firework shows in the area had ended within the last hour. Yet,this object was moving at a steady pace - not as though it had been shot out of a cannon, and grew larger in size as it came into view. When said object did not explode and rather, ascended higher into the night sky -we realized that this was not a fireworks display. We also realized that this a! rea of the coast does not have a fireworks show. From our vantage in our backyard in San Pedro, the Palos Verdes Hill blocks any view of the firework displays in Redondo Beach and north through Manhattan Beach. When we first noticed the object it appeared as a perfect triangle. We referred to it as a “Golden Pyramid.” Its coloration was a mixture of gold, orange, red, yellow and appeared to be pulsating within itself - as if it were on fire. Said object rose into the night sky to a point where it was clearly too high for visibility. It ascended in a straight line for about 6 minutes, made an arc north for about 4 minutes, then continued to raise straight up into the night sky where it became a small pinprick of a light. It then appeared to shoot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  The reason we knew it not to be a firework was because the glowing and pulsating was contained within the shape of the triangle - there were no trails of sparks of flame leaving the triangle. For example, when one views images of the sun from space, it has flares shooting out from it’s surface. This object had the same appearance, but all was contained within the shape of the triangle. It also neve! r fell in altitude. If it were a balloon, flare, or firework - they would all pop and descend in an obvious manner. This object did not. Weather balloons also do not glow in the manner we witnessed. The four of us were flabbergasted and kept asking each other what we saw. Only a few minutes had passed when yet another object emerged in the same spot in the sky as  the previous object. It was larger than the first, but matched coloration and appearance. What solidified that the first object was not anything we have ever seen before, the second object followed the same exact course over the same exact amount of time, rising into the night sky until it was no longer visible. We attempted to film the object on our cell phones, but a combination of light pollution from the street light over our backyard and low resolution on our camera phones made it impossible. A few minutes after the second craft had disappeared into the black of night, a night flying Cessna airplane flew over roughly the same area the first UFO appeared.  We determined this was the altitude private planes must fly and that the first “Golden Pyramid”  appeared much higher in the sky.  A flare was shot off in the southeast corner of our visibility - toward Long Beach - and we concluded this object was nothing close to a flare.  These were two solid reference points for us to analyze what the situation was. Both of the crafts appeared, and rose into space.  Plain and simple. Maybe they were watching the fireworks as well!  There is no firework that could follow such behavior patterns, and there has not been any man made craft that the public has knowledge of that would accomplish such feats.  We researched rocket and missile launches in the area, and we came up empty handed for that date.  All we know is that we all saw the same thing and hope to find someone else who witnessed the same thing.  I write this review so late because I barely found this site today, but feel the need to share what the four of us saw in the night sky that evening.  There is not a single day that goes by where I forget about this experience and my life has completely changed since then.;33.7353393939394;-118.299103787879
V-shaped formation of lights over Long Beach /Orange County area.;2018-11-26 19:55:00;3 minutes;V shaped formation of lights over Long Beach /Orange County area. On 11/26/2018, at approximately 1955hrs, I was traveling eastbound on 19th street just east of Western Ave in the city of San Pedro, CA.  In the eastern sky and fairly low to the horizon, I observed two orange orbs of light that appeared to be stationary and were glowing brightly then dimming.  The lights were possibly over the area of Long Beach or possibly further towards the east.  The lights were horizontally positioned with the right orb glowing brighter.  Suddenly a third light appeared then an additional 2 lights, forming a V shape.  The last three lights then dimmed and disappeared leaving only two lights that seemed to move further to the east and out of my line of sight.  Additionally, while the lights were in the V shape formation, they appeared to have moved clockwise before the three lights disappeared. I am currently employed as a police officer and have flight experience in rotor craft and I am familiar with the various types of aircraft. I observed no anti collision lights and the maneuver of the lights were unlike any aircraft that I have seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally sober-minded and capable.  We suspect that he is an unusually reliable witness.
