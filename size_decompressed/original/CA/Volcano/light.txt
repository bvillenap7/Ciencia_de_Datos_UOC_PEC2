Light above the tree line.;2017-03-15 03:00:00;2 hours;Light above the tree line. Saw a bright light in the sky above the tree line.  Light appeared to change colors.  Smaller fainter lights blinked around the bright light and the bright light would move towards the fainter lights.  This light did not appear to move with the stars and remained in the same area for two hours.   My wife and I both witnessed the light.;38.4756;-120.5972
