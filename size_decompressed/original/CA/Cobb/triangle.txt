Giant Triangle sighting in northern california.;2012-08-25 11:00:00;5 minutes;Giant Triangle sighting in northern california &quotIn a semi rural area of Lake County in  northern California two friends and I decided to take the dogs out and  go camping  in Boggs National forest which we were all been before. We showed up to the camp site around 10:30 at night. I was in the bed of a buddy&quots truck unloading things for our camp when my friend and I both saw sort of light at the corner of our eyes. We looked through the dense trees to an area we had just driven through minutes previous. There below the tree line was an enormous triangle less than 100 yards away. My third friend was in his truck blasting music super loud. After my second friend and I noticed this giant object, we began yelling at our friend to turn off the music. Once he did we could hear a low kinda humming noise coming from the craft. We watched as it slowly disappeared  into the forest. From where I was standing i could see the actual sides of the object. It resembled a ball rack used with a pool table. The sides were rounded with great big white lights at each corner. This thing was so close and so low only two lights were visible, as we were observing from a side view not bottom. The strange thing about this was it physically couldn't have been where we saw it. I mean it just appeared out of nowhere, and would have plowed over hundreds of trees and made a whole lot of noise doing so. This thing seamed to float right through them. It moved steady and slow;38.815;-122.7157
