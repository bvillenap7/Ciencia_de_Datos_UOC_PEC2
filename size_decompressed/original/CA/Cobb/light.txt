Large red glowing pulsating ball.;2018-09-12 01:58:00;Few seconds;At 1:58 a.m., on Sept 12th, in Lake County, CA, I saw thru a clearing in the tall pine tree forest a large bright red pulsating light traveling from the west moving in a south easterly direction.  It was a ways above the 120 foot tall pine trees surrounding my area.  It moved in a straight line, pulsating red as it flew across the sky.  I saw it clearly for a few seconds in a clearing above my house & then again intermittently through the tall pines as it travelled out of sight.  It was moving fast and there was no sound coming from the object.  If it had been a plane or helicopter, I would have heard it because of its altitude.  The event of seeing it lasted only about 10 seconds, of which I got a clear view of the object for about 3 seconds.  It was a dime size large red glowing pulsating ball with no tail.;38.815;-122.7157
