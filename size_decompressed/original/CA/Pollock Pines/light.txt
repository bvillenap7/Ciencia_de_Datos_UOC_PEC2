My friend and I were sitting at ((name deleted)) on the patio. As we were talking I noticed that beyond his head about 2 miles away (as the crow flys) I saw what I thought was a star. I kept turning on then off. I told him and he turned around to watch it too. I would slowly turn off the all of the sudden it would be there again. This happened a few times then we noticed it was getting closer and larger. We then saw that it had a triangle shape to it. As we joked about it it turned off and dissappeared for about 5 minutes. It then reappeared only this time it was farther away and more north. After it had moved north a little it shot off what seems to be a light ball of some sort.It was strange because it just seems to stay in one spot except when it was moving closer to us. My friend is a network engineer for Intel and has had 10 years of Navel expeeriance. I am single mother of two teenagers. I wworked for ((name deleted))up until last April when I had a sledding accident and broke my back.;38.7705;-120.5433

It was a soild white color. It came closer and as it did so it also got brighter and bigger. It started moving around in cirlcles. After that it shot to the left very fast, and then to the right at the same speed. It continued going back and forth. It stopped and shrunk into nothing.;38.7705;-120.5433
I saw an orb of white light traveling extremely fast at treetop level that appeared to be the size of my fist if I were to raise it;2000-11-11 18:35:00;15 seconds;I saw an orb of white light traveling extremely fast at treetop level that appeared to be the size of my fist if I were to raise it It was a full moon outside and there was no clouds in the sky. I was walking outside my residence when a bright whit orb flew aross the sky at an extremely high rate of speed. It looked to be about at treetop level. Pine trees as, I live in the Sierras. I waited to see if it would return or anything to follow, but nothing happened. If I raise my fist into the air it was about that size at the treetop level. Also it made no sound at all.;38.7705;-120.5433
bright white light get bigger then smaller  and then travel away from or into space.;2003-10-20 21:30:00;40 seconds;bright white light get bigger then smaller  and then travel away from or into space. I walked down my drive-way to pick up our mail, and I usually I look up into the sky towards the higher Sierras (north-east from my location). This area is always the darkest and stars are easy to see. At this point I thought I was watching a star burn-out, but what I saw was a bright white light get bigger then smaller and then travel away from or out into space, the light got smaller it changed to redish orange as if a jet turned on it's boosters and vanished after about thirty to sixty seconds. There was no trail left behind but it moved ultra fast, I thought this could be the rocketship that was launched from kursicstan. Hope this info helpfull.;38.7705;-120.5433
Ten small, white, shiny objects hovered over our house in changing formations before drifting upwards and disappearing.;2012-03-03 16:00:00;30 Minutes;Ten small, white, shiny objects hovered over our house in changing formations before drifting upwards and disappearing. On March 3rd, my mother and I were on our back porch, watching a large flock of waterfowl fly overhead, when we noticed something else among the birds.  At first, they appeared to be another flock of some kind of fowl, until we realized how slowly they were moving.  There were ten of them, and they were small, white dots, and, from what I saw through a pair of binoculars, appeared to look slightly like deformed bowling pins.  Over 20-30 minutes, they slowly made their way through the sky for about four or five hundred yards and then stopped directly over our house.  Then they hovered there soundlessly (the noisy geese were long gone), and the ten of them would move slowly into differnt formations, mostly triangles.  They did this for about ten minutes, and then slowly seemed to drift upwards until disappearing into the sky.;38.7705;-120.5433
