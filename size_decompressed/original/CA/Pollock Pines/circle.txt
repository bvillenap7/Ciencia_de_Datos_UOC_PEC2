Seem to know it was getting my attention, because I had this feeling something was watching me from the sky, nkt on anything or alcohol and two others confirmed seeing an object. Then it held its position in the sky, about a pin dot but still silver in color and now strobing in a way, maybe reflection from sun. It traveled in a clockwise movement, when I went to get my binoculars to get a better view it was no longer in my view.  It shook me to my core and I watch satellites and space station fly by every day, this was not that. Maybe a drone but how far it went to the sky and the distance just seems unimaginable.;38.7705;-120.5433
