Just under clouds a large disk with five to seven bright blue lights around the edges of the bottom of the disk.  The lights looked large from the ground maybe three to four inches in diameter so again probably much bigger close up.  The lights were an octagon-like shape.  Hovered for a couple of minutes, then moved from side to side very slowly, then pivoted so you could see the entire bottom of the disk (stayed like that for at least ten seconds which is why I have so many details about what the bottom of the disk looked like), then turned diagonal and shot through the air in a diagonal.  Then it appeared in the same spot, hovered over the street, the lights turned off for a second, then back on, then off again, then on.  I had to drive away because I wasn't sure what I was seeing and had errands to run but spend at least 4-8 minutes looking.  When we drove off it was still there.  On our way back from errands we drove the same way, there was a helicopter flying around the area...my friend in the car said it might be military because it had strobe like lights on it.
