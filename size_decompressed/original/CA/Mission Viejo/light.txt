As I watched it it slowed and changed direction. I am a security patrol officer and I spend long hours sitting in a vehicle,so when I do exit the vehicle a good strech is nesisary.As I had my back arched and head back I noticed a small solid red light moving across the sky above me going what appeard South to North. I assumed it was a plane but it was moving very fast and there was no blinking lights on it at all.I then thought a shootong star?,but no tail... As I realized what I was looking at it quickly and visibly slowed almost to a stop,before performing what looked like a loop de loop and shooting off East to West.At this time I saw what looked like a second object appear and take off after the other one.(I say appear because I diddnt see where it came from) The entire event took less than twenty seconds.;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382
this was a ufo triing to blend in with the stars, and nothing to be in the way not to make it  a plane;2001-06-28 03:00:00;about 1hour;this was a ufo triing to blend in with the stars, and nothing to be in the way not to make it  a plane well for the past several day's (about one week from today 06/21/01). i have been getting home real late in the night between 12:00-1:00am the night sky has been really clear with little or no clouds at all. well beeing that i live in city it's really hard to see any stars out at night, well our street light has been out so now im able to see all of stars now that the light is out. well both a friend and i just took a couple of minuets to enjoy the site, all of a sudden i had looked compleatly around to see others starsand thats when i noticed a plane or something to that fact and thinking to myself that it really was'nt on the normal flight patterns that i have ever noticed before. thats when i told my friend to look at it to see what he thought of it? he at first said it's a planet,thats when i told him than why is it moving and at that time we both started to find a stationary point to see if it was moving. well useing the roofline as our point it took about 2-3 minuets to appearour roof point. thats when we knew it was nothing from our world. no plane is that slow, that bright, and can pretty much stay that stationary for that long without any fluxuation in direction or alt. we both observed a bright light in a perfect circle as if it was triing to blend in with the stars occasionaly moving l/r and up/down. at that time we went inside and my father happen to be awake we told him about it. and with both of us he seen it too. there was only one of them i beleive and seem to be either observing or or just watching over the canyon. well later that morning my father seen it again but closer, and i rechecked my refrence point when the sun was out and nothing was in the way just clear sky. and thats when i knew for a fact it was a ufo. and remembered that i didsee about 2-3 more earlier that week as well as another neighbor of mine did too last week. ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to look in the southern sky on the next clear night, to ensure that he is not observing Mars.  PD));33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382
Three bright lights in the morning on a bright and sunny day.;2003-08-17 10:00:00;20 minutes;Three bright lights in the morning on a bright and sunny day. Sitting in the hot tub at around 10AM and saw 1 bright light in the sky. It appeared to be at about 1,000 feet or so and then moved farther up into the sky. Keep in mind that this was in the morning and almost no clouds. The light moved farther up in the sky and then I saw two such lights. They seemed to be very high. I called my wife to come out of the house to see the lights. Once she came out, we saw another light in a different part of the sky and it appeared to be very high, although it was impossible to tell. The reason is that we could not make out any shape, it was just a light in the blue sky. That light began to move across the sky at a fast rate of speed and moved behind the house roof. Very strange! I have never seem anything like it until I saw the pictures of such exact lights on the rense.com website. Here is the link. They looked exactly like these pictures-I would like to know if anyone else saw these lights. http://www.rense.com/general40/phoenix.htm;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382

THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY STOPPED IN MID-AIR. AT THIS POINT I SAY SEVERAL MORE OF THESE LIGTS APPEAR FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THEN THEY STARTED DARTING AROUND AT A VERY, VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. JUST SHORT BURST.AS I CONTINUED TO WATCH THIS STRANGE THING HAPPENING IN FRONT OF ME, TWO OF THE OBJECTS(lights)STREAKED OF INTO SPACE AT BLISTERING SPEED. ALL THE WHILE THE OTHER 4 TO 5 OBJECTS CONTINUE TO STREAK SIDE TO SIDE AND UP AND DOWN. AFTER ABOUT 10 SECONDS A OBJECT THAT APPEARED TO BE ORANGE CAME STREAKING BACK INTO VISION AND APRROX.

Two very bright red and white lights flashing in the sky completely still and silent befor disappearing at very high speeds.;2012-11-14 05:00:00;8 minutes;Two very bright red and white lights flashing in the sky completely still and silent befor disappearing at very high speeds. I was watching television.  And at around 5:00 am I rolled over on the couch to see if the sun was up yet. I opened the blinds, and it was still very dark, that’s when I noticed a stationary red pulsating light over the neighbor’s apartment.  I continued to watch the light for about 2-3 minutes it would flash 9 times red then 1 time white.   As I continued to watch the light I noticed another red light seemingly to come from nowhere fly directly underneath the original red light.  I continued to watch the lights for about another minute, that’s when the second light to arrive shot off to my left over my roof, and out of sight.  I knew at that time that this was not a helicopter.  However I was still not sure of what I was seeing, the original red light was still there so I went outside on my doorstep to see if I could hear anything.  There was no sound.  It was completely still in the sky very bright, and very silent.   I went back inside and continued to watch the fla! shing light 9 red 1 white.  For some stupid reason I became a little anxious, I thought to myself, what if this thing is watching me watching it.  I have heard of UFO sightings being questionable, explainable, and somewhat brief.  I have never been a believer, nor have I ever had an interest in UFO’s or alien’s, until now.  I do not know what I saw, but I know what I saw and I do not believe it was anything man made.  I watched this UFO for a solid 8 minutes before it literally shot off to my right in the opposite direction as the second UFO, over the neighbors apartment and out of sight.   I paced back and fourth in my apartment trying to make sense of what I had witnessed trying to compare memories of what I have seen prior to in the sky.  Nothing matched.   I am a frequent flyer between here and the U.K  I know what planes look like at night time from the ground and in the air, I have seen many helicopters in the sky, this was neither of them.  I went onto the internet and searched what I had seen and to my surprise there are many similar sightings thank god, because for a minute there I started to doubt myself, but to deny myself what I had seen would just be a lie.  I know what I witnessed on 11/14/2012 at 5 am and I feel very privileged, even if my friends and family don’t believe me, I do not care.   I however on the other hand am now a believer, and I truly hope that this wont be my last sighting because the unexplainable is truly awesome!;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382
Four red lights floated up over Mission Viejo, CA.;2013-08-24 23:00:00;7 minutes;Four red lights floated up over Mission Viejo, CA 4 red lights were observed rising from behind the rooftop of my neighbors home.  They floated up one by one to a certain height, where all four of them appeared to fade out into darkness.  They looked like they were approximately one to two miles away. I have never seen Chinese lanterns but these things definitely behaved like I would imagine a Chinese lantern to behave.  They disappeared at a height that was partially obscured by my neighbor's palm tree approximately 80-100 feet away from where I was standing in my backyard.  The palm tree is approximately 25 feet tall.;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382
Two orange lights seen in southern California.;2014-06-18 22:30:00;30 minutes;Two orange lights seen in southern California. From 10:30 to 11:00 p.m. on June 18th, 2014, my sister and I, along with many other by standers, saw two orange lights in the sky.  We were in Mission Viejo, California.  These lights were huge and would dim in and out.  We noticed a white trail or attachment coming from the top of the lights.  The two lights would both be lit for a little while until one would go out, like they were taking turns.  This went on until 11:00 when they both went out.;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382

Two very bright white lights changing in brightness, size, and distance were spotted above our house.  They would slowly move closer and closer to each other and then when touching, would move quickly away only to repeat the process.;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382
