Extremely bright object in the eastern sky in southern O.C. moving very slowly.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible contrail??  PD));2005-01-18 06:20:00;30 seconds;Extremely bright object in the eastern sky in southern O.C. moving very slowly that suddenly lost its luminance and disappeared I'm not sure if what I saw fits the true definition of a U.F.O. It was extremely bright, like a star or a planet. I frequently look out to the south (southeast) in the early morning to gaze at what I believe is Venus or some other planet, because it is extremely bright relative to the other stars. This object that I saw on the 18th was due east and roughly 30 degrees above the horizon It appeared to be slightly moving, although now I can't recall the exact direction. It's motion was unspectacular. It travelled neither far, nor fast and it's movement wasn't particularly perceptible. The strange thing is that it looked like a very bright star/planet, and I've never seen a star that bright in that location before, and to the best of my knowledge there shouldn't be one at that location. After staring at it for about 30 seconds it just went dim and disappeared. Now it is true that the sun was beginning to rise, but it had not come up over the horizon. Also there were plenty of other stars in various locations relative to the object in question that were still visible, and their brightness only seemed to dim gradually as I continued to look outside. They've never just went dead as if someone pulled the plug. There were stars both above and below the object/celestial body when it stopped shining. There is a huge amount of air traffic in this area as we are in a large metropolitan area that is surrounded by two gigantic metropolitan areas ( L.A. and S.D.) and a major military installation ( Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base ). This craft/thing was unidentifiable to me so I thought you might be interested.;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382

2 Large orange orbs sighted from Mission Viejo, CA.;2013-05-03 22:30:00;3 minutes;2 Large orange orbs sighted from Mission Viejo, CA We live in a tri-level, with our bedroom on the second story.  We were upstairs getting in to bed, our room was dark, other than the TV and out our window I notice two large round orange spheres coming from the east (Palm Springs), heading directly to us (ocean is 7 miles west of us).  We watched them for approximately 2 minutes â€“ they were staying on a level course with no flashing or blinking lights, just a steady orange glow, and kept the same distance from each other.   Our window was open and we did not hear any motor noise at all. We watched the two spheres approach in the lower night sky, then go out of view over our house.   We ran out to our front yard and continued to watch them both head northwest.  The first one disappeared and soon after the second one dimmed, and then disappeared.;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382
