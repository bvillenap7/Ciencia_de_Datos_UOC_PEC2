V-shaped translucent Airship Above Spotted Bull Way.;2014-09-13 08:30:00;3-5 seconds;V-shaped Translucent Airship Above Spotted Bull Way 09/13/14 approx 8:30 a.m.   Driving southbound on I-5 approaching Avery and I-5/73 interchange, above Spotted Bull Way, below the clouds.   While driving, I saw something Iâ€™m unable to explain.   A flash of sunlight caught my attention.  I looked up to see the sunshine bouncing off the clouds through a V-shaped translucent craft with a large bright circle at the rear of each wing and at the nose of the craft with smaller circles between them.   As quickly as it appeared, it disappeared.  It was invisible before I was able to pull over to safely take a picture. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.
