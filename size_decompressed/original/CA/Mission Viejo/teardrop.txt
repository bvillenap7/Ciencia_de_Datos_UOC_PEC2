Helicopter seen following an elongated teardrop UFO;2020-11-13 15:45:00;30 seconds;Helicopter seen following an elongated teardrop UFO When driving North, onto the 5 Freeway onramp from La Paz Road, to the West I saw a Huey type helicopter following an elongated teardrop shaped vehicle. They both were about 500 feet above ground, and heading North. The UFO shined a very bright whitish light for 3-5 seconds. The UFO was gray overall, and both were about 1 mile away. I saw no details on the UFO, other than the teardrop shape or outline. I lost sight of both after 30 seconds, as the tree line obscured them. A minute later, I caught sight of the helicopter again, still on a Northerly heading, before it turned to the West, but the UFO was nowhere to be seen. No idea where it went, or how.;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382
