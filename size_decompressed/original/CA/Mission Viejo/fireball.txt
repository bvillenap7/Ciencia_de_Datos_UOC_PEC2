Vibrant, blue/purple fireball hovering and spanning across the night sky in Mission Viejo.;2014-12-09 21:42:00;3 minutes;Vibrant, blue/purple fireball hovering and spanning across the night sky in mission viejo I was sitting in my room on my bed watching a movie and my window is directly in front of me to the right of my television which gives me a perfect view of the sky.  I am able to see planes fly by quite frequently, so I am very familiar with what planes appear to be in the night sky.   However, what I saw can be described as the following:  A vibrant, bright blue-ish purple fireball with a very clear blue aura, almost 4 or 5 times the size of what the planes usually appear as in the night sky, which made me feel it was extremely near by.   Initially, the colors and abnormal appearance of this object is what caught my attention and got me off of my bed to take a closer look, but the thing that made me rush for my phone to take a video was when it had stopped in the sky and started to move backwards, or in the opposite direction it was originally moving in I should say.   It continued to stop and hover, then move up and down in such smooth, swift, and effortless transitions.  It was clear that this object was capable of moving at speeds much faster than any aircraft known to this planet just by the range it covered every second it was in the sky.  After 3 minutes, I lost view of it after it passed behind a tree so I rushed downstairs and out the front door to see if it were still there to get a closer look but it was gone.  Then i noticed the usual planes in the sky which gave me even more reassurance that this flying object was, without any hesitation, my first UFO sighting. I have a 2 min 42 second video of my sighting.;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382

A bright light illuminated the road, so I looked up, thinking it was the moon, and wondering how it could be so bright, but the moon was way off, rather it was a giant fireball of the whitest light shooting straight down and flashing on its descent.;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382
