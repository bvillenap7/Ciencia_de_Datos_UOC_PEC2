ring/orb of light pulses while dipping and dancing in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2008-11-10 21:40:00;about 5 min.;ring/orb of light pulses while dipping and dancing in sky We happened to glance up into the sky, we noticed some very bright lights.  They pulsed with bright and dim white light and occasionally flashed red then back to bright white.  They rotated to reveal there ring like quality and rose and dipped much like a kite or a jellyfish “playing” in the sky.  At one point they appeared to be free falling and then would begin to rise again-  Extremely high and extremely fast, while rising they moved in circular fashion with no apparent pattern finally dropping below the our view due to neighborhood trees.  My husband said it reminded him of the portrayal of the UFO in the movie Close Encounters. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
