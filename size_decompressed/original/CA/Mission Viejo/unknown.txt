UFO over Mission Viejo, CA on July 16, 2013.;2013-07-16 21:45:00;10 minutes;UFO over Mission Viejo, CA on July 16, 2013. The object was oval at first. Large orange in color.  My flash was on, so the picture is a little blurred.  I think it saw my flash, because as I was trying to turn off my flash the object darted upward and I got a few more pictures as it disappeared.  Then I saw it further up as it disappeared into space.  The rear of the object was more slender and you could see the engine.   I was in the US Air Force and I can honestly say I never saw anything like this in my life.  My pictures speak for them selves.  I am now living in Arkansas.;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382
