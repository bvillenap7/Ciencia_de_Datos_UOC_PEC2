Formation high-flying 'pearls' in a daylight sky.;2000-04-01 13:00:00;2-3 MINUTES;Formation high-flying 'pearls' in a daylight sky. While watching a large airliner (a usual activity of mine as I am a pilot) fly almost directly overhead and to the southeast in a bright, clear and cloudless early afternoon sky, I noticed another jet traveling due east quite a bit higher. This second plane was a smaller business jet, probably a Cessna Citation as the wings were straight out from the body of the plane. It was flying at around twenty-five to thirty throusand feet in altitude. As I watched the small jet for a moment, two non-twinkling objects about the brightness of medium stars and about the same apparent size passed to either side of the small jet in the exact opposite direction. As the two objects continued in a due west direction and just before passing directly overhead, one object (the one that passed on the plane's right, or south side) abruptly turned to the southwest at a forty-five degree angle. The other object continued on a little farther and then turned due north. The turn was immediate, not like an airplane making a banking turn. I continued watching this one and in a few seconds it was joined by two more, one coming in from either side and together they formed a triangle, continueing to fly due north. After a couple more seconds, they moved in what I can only describe as a dance as they moved playfully around each other. Almost immediately they were joined by two more, one coming in from each side again. The five ojbects continued north until I could no longer distinguish them from the bright, blue sky. I have since seen (not without some excitement on my part) a report on T.V., with video no less, of almost exactly what I saw. The objects were described as 'pearls'. They were the same as I witnessed silent, white and round and did not seem to give off light of their own. The objects on T.V. were also in diamond formations of many more than I saw (up to thirty at a time). Single 'pearls' would even turn away from the others at smooth forty-five degree angles.;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382
I think I have had a close encounter in Oranger County California;2007-03-11 00:00:00;8 seconds;I think I have had a close encounter in Oranger County California I was observing and airplane overhead going west, and I could hear it.......... just then I saw a silent formation of 5 aircraft flying east in formation all in one row, each about the size of a 727, guessed size from  lights, they were in my view for only 8 - 10 seconds and disappeared.   There was not any sound from these 5 aircraft at all.  The odd thing is the silence and the fact the lights disappeared when it was a clear nite, I could have followed for at least another 2 minutes, but their lights were gone.   I have never seen any thing like this before in my life.  I am at a loss for an explaination as too late tin the evening for reflections, definetley were not birds migrating as i have never seen a flock with lights all traveling at the same speed etc//;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382
Orange lights in sky over Mission Viejo.;2013-07-18 21:10:00;2 minutes;Orange lights in sky over Mission Viejo I saw what appeared to be the big dipper in the SE sky at about 45’.  The stars appeared bright orange, and larger that normal.  There were possibly ten though I did not count them.  It was a very clear night with the moon hidden behind trees to the right of the objects.  The sky was a light blue rather than black. After a short period of time (possibly 30 seconds) they started to move with four of the upper ‘stars’ shaping a square and the others moving about in what seemed random patterns.  They continued to move about in the same general area until they started to dim and go out.  One stayed for about 20 seconds or so longer than the rest before it disappeared.   Afterwards I did see several lights from planes coming from that general direction.  I could not tell how high they were or if they were high flying helicopters.  Planes at a high elevation are normal for our area. The movements of the lights looked precise and they appeared to move one direction and then reverse or change to an up or down motion.   According to the current weather information Precipitation is 0% Humidity 77% and Wind is 0 mph. I was with my dog who was more interested in sniffing things than the distant objects.;33.6125314009662;-117.647359903382
