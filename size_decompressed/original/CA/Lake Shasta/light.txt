Object speeds through night sky.;1996-09-06 20:00:00;1-2 min;Summary : Object speeds through night sky. just a 45 year old stargazer. We were on a houseboat on lake shasta viewing the north westerly star that flickers a lot and is one of the brighter stars when shooting up off the horizon was a star like object moving at an incredible speed. We both had binoculars and stated to each other wow what is that as we followed it. Once it became almost straight up from N/W heading S/E another object just as fast came from the east heading due west. My friend followed it and I removed my binoculars to see if the ob- ject heading S/E could be viewed with the naked eye which it could not so I captured it again with the binoculars until it went out of sight. According to the docudrama asteroids there are quite a few asteroids orbiting the earth so I wasn't to sure if I should even list this one. However I've never seen anything like this before moving at the speed that it was so here it is. Thx for existing.;40.6969;-122.3683

We were about half-way over the Lake Shasta bridge, and off to the east I saw a green glowing light hovering in the sky.  It hovered there for maybe 3 seconds, and just shot across the sky and was gone.  The rate of speed it traveled at seemed faster than a shooting star to me.
