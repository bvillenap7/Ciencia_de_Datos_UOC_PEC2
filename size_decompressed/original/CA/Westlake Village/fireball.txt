At a certain point the trail began to expand and became a huge expanding circular envelope resembling mist. From the bright centre it seemed like four bright white streaks were spreading. At its maximum the cloud was maybe ten or fifteen moon-widths across. The speed did not seem all that fast. Gradually the bright centre burned out. The phenomenon must have been very high up because it remained white throughout although the sun was well below the horizon. Also, given the height, the white mist cloud must have been really enormous. Parts of the trail became red (presumably as they sank lower) but one part was also green/turquoise. At first I assumed this was a sizeable comet fragment but the four white streaks and the green coloured section makes me think it was maybe man made and the cloud was unused fuel (though I wonder why it was not burning).

White fireball over city of Westlake Village;2008-05-17 09:00:00;5 seconds;White fireball over city of Westlake Village I was walking up the stairs of my house and look out the window to see a bright white fireball heading straight at the city and at about 4000 feet above the city it made a right angle turn towarda the other side of the vally then disapered in a small flash of light. I dont think any man made flying object can turn like that.;34.1474534246578;-118.83383671233
