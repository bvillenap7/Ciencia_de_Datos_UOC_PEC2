They remained relatively stationary but moved in spirals.  About 45 minutes after we first sighted the objects we heard two aircraft.  One was a prop and the other seemed to be a low flying jet.  Within the same time period we saw what looked to be a shooting star that arched close to one of the flashing objects.  If you have any information that could explain our sighting we would be very interested.  You can e-mail at:  ((e-address deleted));34.1474534246578;-118.83383671233
