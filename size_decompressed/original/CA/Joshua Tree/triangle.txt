Scalene triangle-shaped craft traveled at a slow to moderate speed across the night sky.;2017-05-10 23:30:00;90 seconds;While parked at the west entrance parking lot of Joshua Tree National Park, I observed the craft as it suddenly appeared ov It suddenly appeared traveling in a NorthEast to SouthWest direction, the scalene triangle-shaped craft traveled at a slow to moderate speed across the night sky. It looked to be a few hundred feet above the ground. Approximate size of the sides were:  One male-adult fist size high on the backward side, Two male-adult fist size long on the top side and a male-adult fist size and a half long on the bottom side.  At each corner, there were bright fluorescent, steady green lights. It emitted a low thrum (a combination of a throbbing and hum sound) noise, almost like a low engine sound, becoming louder as it was directly overhead. It continued to travel across the moon-lit sky for the time-duration stated above, gaining speed, and then both the lights and sound were gone.;34.1499;-116.312
