We had just got home around 5:50 pm. As I got off the car I looked up and said the stars are shining bright tonight. As I continued to look I noticed a formation of lights that suddenly appeared from the east moving northwest. I said look what is that and my daughter, her friend, and my fianc√© came back to see and we just stared. There must have been 20-30 of them one right after the other appearing and then disappearing.  They looked as if stars where on an escalator. There was no sound of any kind.;34.1499;-116.312
