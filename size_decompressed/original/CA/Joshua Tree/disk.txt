I brought it to their attention and about that time as it was moving from left to right, or west to east, i began to see that there was a bright white center. i quickly got out my camera phone and started to take pics.  after a few shots, i turned and changed the resolution on my phone. when i did, they said that it dipped and made a turn that was simmilar to a question mark.  i turned around in time to take some more pics as it fadded out of sight. there was no sound associated with this craft nor was there any strobe like from conventional aircraft. it couldnt have been more than 200-300 feet high.;34.1499;-116.312

Followed the vapor trail to where it ended east over the 29 Palms Marine Base.  At the end of the vapor trail were 3 objects circling each other, in close formation, maybe so high up to be in outer space and when looking off to the left, there was another to the west.  Large amount of military action during this time.  Sightings were in daylight, not just lights in the night sky. The objects were rotating around each other about once every 7 seconds.  Occurred @ apx 2:35 PST, in daylight;34.1499;-116.312
