I've seen this thing more then once about 7 times my teacher has also seen it.  It is always around the same spot if you were to come you would most likely see it.  This is not a joke ive got better things to do with my time!  When the thing comes, it move from left to right really slow and then disappear into nothing as if it zooms out.  It come back around 2-3 times.  I aint good at directions but i can show u where it is.  It often comes around the same time ive seen it once at sunset. You can call me at 760-((number deleted)).  My name is ((name deleted)).;34.1499;-116.312
