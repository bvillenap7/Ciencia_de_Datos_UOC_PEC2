Daughter pointed out strange light in the sky that looked crazy to her.  I saw it and immediately took out my phone.  There were probably 5 or so white lights that flashed from left to right, then right to left, continuously.   The sun was not yet set and the lights were brighter than anything possible.  It was very long horizontally, moved extremely fast, it was there and gone in less than 2 minutes and made no noise that we could hear.  It was not visible by the end of the video.   I have the video ready to upload.;33.6415876288659;-117.6922
