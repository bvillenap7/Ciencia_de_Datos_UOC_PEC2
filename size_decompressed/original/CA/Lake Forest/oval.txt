Well i am 17 i have lived here for about ten years and i have been a skeptic and am also a night owl. I have a previous report to you about another sighting a year or two ago. Anyways my living room looks out a sliding glass door to a forest behind my house. Anyway i was talking to my girlfriend on the phone in the room sitting on the couch looking at the slider door. Then out of nowhere the craft appeared above the trees. I saw the craft and since it just appereared i took interest that it might be the same craft as my last sighting which had also just appeared out of thin air. I told my girlfriend to hold on and i stared at the craft when it then changed colors, moved to the right popped away then reappeared flew to the middle and dissappeared. I panicked and told my GF what i had just seen. I am always watching the skys since that seconed sighting. The craft has not reeappeared.

2 UFO'S THAT WERE  NOT FROM HUMAN TECHNOLOGY;2007-06-18 21:55:00;5 minutes;2 UFO'S THAT WERE  NOT FROM HUMAN TECHNOLOGY 2 objects were moving in the sky in ways man made aircraft could not. Stop , hover, roll, fast, slow. They were unbelievable.We have nothing that is that quick. I was playing a round of night golf with my son, who spotted them. He was so scared, he still is shaking. The way they moved was awesome, but what really was great were their lights. Brillant colors, all in circles, around the craft.Way brighter than any airplane lights, or for any lights I have ever seen period. They are what really have my mind thinking something is not right here. Because we just don't have that technology yet.Whatever was in the sky tonight wasn't one of ours.People will laugh, but I know what I saw.;33.6415876288659;-117.6922
