circular object spotted flying in a pendulum flying pattern above Lake Forest, California;2006-08-06 21:00:00;3 min;circular object spotted flying in a pendulum flying pattern above Lake Forest, California When going to the bank, as i parked my car i noticed 3 flying lights, of thse 3, 2 moved like an airplane (slow moving to my perspective and not changing direction), one was moving erradically from far away, but moving im my direction (note it did have the mormal red flashing light like a normal plane)(also Note the direction of travel was south east into my position). So i went into the bank and as i came out, this object had now moved closer and still moved erradically, the motion is as described below: this motion was characterised by a general movement of a pendulum, moving back and forth with some vibration as it moved. As this object was closer, i saw it at about 65 degrees from horizontal. When the motion of the object moved it closer to me, i got a chance of seeing the bottom of this object when i relized it was a round shape because it had rectangular lights aligned in a circle arround the bottom of it. one further realization was that the manuevers it was doing (although possible to a stunt plane) were not possible, even so when the object appeared at the end of a pendulum swing to have dropped straight down. AS far as the color i coudn't tell since the object was seen at night, and it's lights were seen clarly but not the color. As far as Sounds, this object didn't make any sounds.;33.6415876288659;-117.6922
Two glowing orange crafts bright and low saying hi to south orange county.;2014-06-18 22:30:00;15 minute;Two glowing orange crafts bright and low saying hi to south orange county. I was driving home at night and i saw something in the sky It was so bright orange pulsing lighting up the night sky all orange like a super lightbulb not moving much but obj odiously birhgt orange going to red yellow 2% of the time turning to purple glow.  I got my neighbor to come out and my parents to come look at it, my neighbor said her husband witnessed the same display a year earlier at the same time and he even saw the object split in two i mind blowing feat not capable by anyones technology. Anyways this same night a second object of similar appearance appeared out of no where and there there two they began slowly moving making no noise keeping in mind i was 5 miles away and these objects were 1 mile above the earth 5 miles away from me for 15 minutes lighting up the night sky like flares except the did not fall or arch like a flare would they were stationary for the most part;33.6415876288659;-117.6922
