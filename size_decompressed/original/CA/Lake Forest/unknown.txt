Finally able to see orange whisp of light where the canopy would convex the dash lights. Left silently sideways over trees. The orange dash lights converging as a whisp of light on the canopy indicate this is a homegrown device. Albiet, w/ alien technology.;33.6415876288659;-117.6922

At approximately 1:20 AM in Lake Forest CA my younger brother, girlfriend and I observed a flying object that seemed to have white strobe lights, these lights were bright and flashed quickly, they stopped and the lights then turn a solid red. There was no shape that we could distinguish in the object. The object was flying away from us but then turned around and seemed to hover over a few areas and stopped then continued its flight passed us. The only way I can describe the flashing is as if the object was taking photographs, we could vaguely hear the sound of a helicopter. I searched youtube and found the exact same object titled A UFO sighting! said to be filmed on July 7th 2009 in San Jose.;33.6415876288659;-117.6922
Short observation of changing lights.;2018-09-07 20:00:00;<1 minute;Short observation of changing lights. At approximately 20:00 on 7 September 2018, I returned home from work and pulled into my driveway.  A bright blue light in the sky approximately 60 degrees up caught my eye, followed by a bright red light approximately 45 degrees horizontal to the left.   Thinking they were too bright to be aircraft, I watched for approximately 30 seconds.  The lights abruptly shifted colors (red to blue and blue to red), then disappeared.   There was no sound, clear airspace, and no communication/signal towers in the vicinity.;33.6415876288659;-117.6922
