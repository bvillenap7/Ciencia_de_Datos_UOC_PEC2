I heard a long sustained rumble, different from anything I've heard. I went outside and heard the sound coming from above me.  I looked up towards the east and saw three lights flying towards my direction. I went indside my house and got my camera. When I came outside I could see three different sets of lights. The lights seemed very low.  I live in an area that is lower than the surrounding land, so they must have been very low. I took several pictures but ran out of memory. One of the sets of lights seemed to move more in my direction then they slowly flew away.;33.6415876288659;-117.6922
