My wife & I were taking our son & daughter to Chuck'E Cheese in Lake Forest to celebrate our son's 11th birthday. It was a little past 8 p.m. when I was driving south on El Toro road. I had to get gas first so I headed for the Arco gas station near the 5 freeway. One block before I pulled in I saw a bright orange ball/light slowly moving South East. I told my son to check out the light. I saw it because it was in front of me at about 200 feet up & 1/4 mile away & it was a clear night. I continued to glance at it until I got to the gas station. After I pulled in my son & I got out of the van & ran over to see it. My wife didn't care to see this. The orange light slowly drifted in the same direction over our heads & then stopped. At this time I was facing south. It was silent. The light stayed there for 3 minutes & started drifting to our right (south west) which placed it above the 5 freeway. At this time I was telling my wife to please see this & she wouldn't budge. The light stopped again & then it flickered & two smaller orange lights came out of it about 2 seconds apart. After this happened the light started to move away & then flickered out. It's as though it released some scout crafts & took off. When it disappeared it was like turning off a light bulb. A few minutes later I saw two military aircraft flying at top speed in the direction of the UFO. I figured that the UFO saw the military jets, launched some scouts & took off before they reached them. My son & I were very excited. This was an amazing event that took place. I knew this wasn't any craft that we have because it didn't have any other lights that are required for aircraft & it was silent. In 1987 while I was in Miami I remember seeing this same type of glowing orange light silently drifting south & when it was overhead it became brighter & then released four smaller orange lights which flew in a V formation with the brighter light in front. It continued flying until it was out of my sight. I use the words light or ball to describe! what wa s viewable. I would have loved to see the craft itself.;33.6415876288659;-117.6922
A light appeared darted left to right then dissapeared;2005-04-12 22:00:00;5 minutes;A light appeared darted left to right then dissapeared Well i like the night time and one night i was out in front of my house, just looking at the stars and out of the corner of my eye i saw a light dart by. I sat up and looked ahead and saw the light moving beyond the trees by my house, so i stood up. The object was a semi bright ball of light. It moved left to right, up, down, right left, hovered, and all this time the colors changed from red to green to white then just dissappeared. Shortly after I think either two or one car alarms went off. I ran in the house and yelled for my dad but he didn t believe me and wouldnt come and look. I have a nother one i will post. Im glad i found out about this site. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.6415876288659;-117.6922
4 bright, large orange orbs of light in night sky lasting 15 munutes;2014-08-25 20:45:00;15 minutes;4 bright, large orange orbs of light in night sky lasting 15 munutes I was driving home on the freeway on Aug. 25, 2014, at approx. 8:45 pm.  I noticed 2 very bright orange orbs in the sky to my right. They were very bright.  They were horizontal to each other, side by side and the distance between them stayed the same. There were tall trees along the fwy so from time to time I lost sight of them, but whenever there was a clearing I could see them.  Although I was traveling at 65 mph, I never got closer to the orbs of light, nor did they get any farther. For a period of 3-4 minutes I lost sight of them due to trees but then I got to a point where the sky was very visible.  There they were but now they where in front of me, slightly to my left, but now there were 4 bright orange orbs, 2 that were verticle and next to it 2 that were horizontal.  They seemed to be stationary in the sky, very bright and had to be seen by everyone traveling down the freeway as well as others who live in the area. There are some news reports about it as well as youtube videos.  The news said it was probably flares from Camp Pendleton during a training exercise.  I don't believe that at all. These orbs stayed in the same position in the sky for 14-15 minutes.  If they were flares, then they were anti-gravity flares.  Camp Pendelton is @ 35 miles to the south of where I was and if they were flares from Pendelton they would not have appeared so big and bright nor stay fixed in the sky for 14 -15 minutes.  Flares descend, these did not.  I have seen flares in the past and these were not flares.;33.6415876288659;-117.6922
