An object that looked like Mars bright red and orange sides.;2014-07-05 21:49:00;3:00 minutes;An object that looked like Mars bright red and orange sides. At around 21:49 on Sunday August 7th, 2014, we were coming from the market and taking the groceries into the house.  I looked up into the sky and told my girlfriend look babe Mars.  The object looked like a star, but since it was red I believed it was Mars.  Then it started glowing orange also, which was odd.   Then my girlfriends mother also started looking at it and said it might be a helicopter but it was way too high to be one. And planes do not shine that bright at that altitude. Then it started moving slowly towards the west.  It looked like it was turning and just like that it disappeared.  No plane that I know of or helicopter can disappear that quick, or turn at that radius as quick as that object did.
