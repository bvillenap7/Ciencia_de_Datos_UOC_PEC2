The crafts were the size of pin-heads and of a silvery color.  My attention because of the slow flying and the straight line of their formation, Military aircraft fly in a Vee formation. My mother and I were waiting for a bus at the Grayhound bus terminal in the city of El Monte.  To the north of our location is a small, city, airport.  I was watching small, priviate, planes taking off from the airport.  As I was watching the planes taking off I noticed four small, slivery aircrafts flying towards the West.  I kept watching them as they were flying in an unuasual manner.  I told my mother who could not see them, at first.  I waited until another plane was taking off. Just as the plane was to the left of where the crafts were I told her to look to the right of them.  She then saw them for herself.  I observed them for several minutes as they flew overhead at a very high altitude.  I hope these next dote show up as I would like them to .      This is the formation in which I first saw them. As I .      watched the crafts flying towards the West they seem to .   arc to the start of a circle arcing towards the left as .            follows below. . . . . The crafts disappeared overhead behind palm trees. The sky was clear and the sun was in the East.  There was nothing to give me any reason to think that they were normal crafts seen in an unusual condition.  That's about all that I can give you.  I only hope that it helps in someway to figure out what is really going on around here.    Good luck.    ((Name deleted.));34.074705;-118.022125
