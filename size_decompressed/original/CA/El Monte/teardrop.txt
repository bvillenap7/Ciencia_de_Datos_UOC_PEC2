Gray oval teardrop shaped craft flying over LA County.;2010-07-14 11:15:00;1 minute;Gray oval teardrop shaped craft flying over LA County. I was riding on the Metrolink from San Bernardino to the Cal State LA station, seated on the side of the train looking south.  Listening to music and watching the scenery pass by I looked up to the sky at about a 35 to 45 degree angle and saw what at first I took to be a airliner that was traveling east to west.   I quickly realized that the shape was not right and that it was not a more whitish color.  It had more of a gray metallic look, and there seemed to be no wings.  This happened rather fast and when I wanted to try to study it more the train passed a few buildings that blocked my view, and when the train passed the buildings, it was gone.;34.074705;-118.022125
