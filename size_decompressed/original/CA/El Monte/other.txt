White flashes when a satellite passed above the horizon.;2015-08-23 21:00:00;3 seconds;White flashes when a satellite passed above the horizon. A friend and I were observing a passing satellite (dim light object) passing from South to North.  We assume they are satellites because many travel throughout the night. When the object passed directly above us, 2 flashes of lights appeared, flashes were 1/2 second apart from each other.  Flashes did not move, they were in the same area.  The size of a school bus, squared, white light. Unexplainable experience, never seen before.  We both stayed for another hour trying to see if the flashes appeared, but unfortunately they did not.  We have observed many satellite objects in years but never seen flashes.;34.074705;-118.022125
