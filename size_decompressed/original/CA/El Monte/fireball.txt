FIREBALL IN CLEAR SKY;2006-07-19 21:30:00;ONE SECOND;FIREBALL IN CLEAR SKY I WAS OUTSIDE WORKING OUT AND SAW A FIREBALL TRAVELED OVERHEAD AT FAST BUT VISIBLE SPEED.  THE SKY WAS CLEAR WITH STARS VISIBLE. THE FIREBALL WAS WHITE COLOR ENGULFED IN ORANGE / REDDISH FIRE STREAKS. IT TRAVELED FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND WAS RATHER LOW TO BE VISIBLE BUT SILENT.  PROBABLY TRAVELED ONE MILE PER SECOND.  I GOT UP TO SEE WHERE IT WAS GOING TO THINKING IT WOULD FALL SOMEWHERE AND CRASH WITH A BOOM BUT DISAPPEARED TO THE HORIZON WITH NO SOUND.  PRIVATE SMALL AIRPLANES FROM THE AIRPORT NEARBY WERE PASSING BY AND I WONDERED IF THEY HAD SEEN SOMETHIING.  I WONDERED IF IT WAS A BURNING OBJECT SUCH AS A SATELLITE OR SOMETHING THAT WAS CRASHING.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF OTHER PEOPLE SAW THIS AND HAVE AN EXPLANATION.  THANK YOU. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
