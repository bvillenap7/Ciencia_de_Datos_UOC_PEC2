Bright orange orb in the sky.;2014-11-14 21:50:00;3 minutess;Bright orange orb in the sky We were outside smoking and we saw an orange orb in the sky that was flashing and got dimmer as time went on.   Skies were partly cloudy but we could see stars AND a plane from a distance.   It seemed higher then a plane and unexplainable.   I've seen comets, meteors, etc.  This I've NEVER seen.
