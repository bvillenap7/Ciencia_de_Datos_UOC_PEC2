flapping flying object with big red light on bottom;2005-10-31 08:45:00;5-15 mins;flapping flying object with big red light on bottom My 2 sisters, 2 friends of mine, and I were all trick or treating on our way back home, and well one of my friends and I had been watching what we thought to be a star, and it seemed to be following us all night, so, we kept out eye on it So we had been walking home and we stopped to look at my watch and saw the time to be around 8:45, so we looked up at the star again, and we noticed that it had moved a little so we stood and watched it, and it started to come towards us, the star had blacked out and it turned into a bright red light, and seemed to have been making a flapping motion towards us like a bird, but it had a bright red light on the bottom of it, we all watched the star in awe realizing it wasn't a star and began to run, the object flew over us and I remembered reading about reports and sighting where peoples watches had stopped and such things but I looked at my watch and over 10 minutes had passed when I swear no more than 5 minutes had gone by! so we quickly ran home, promised to tell no one, except maybe report it to a site like this.;38.1089318840579;-122.228439130435
Red flare like light descending in the sky;2017-04-17 06:05:00;30-60 seconds;Red flare like light descending in the sky I was outside with a neighbor and crew members from the local Fire Dept.  I saw a bright red light descending high over the sky like a flare.  The weather was cloudy so the clouds surrounding it were lit up as well.   I asked the fire crew what it was and they said a flare.  I heard one guy say, you can hear it, too.    When I walked into a more open area and turned my head I could hear a muffled roar.  It was difficult to determine a shape, but maybe a upside V would be the best way to describe it.   My neighbor said, I don't know what it is but something is on fire.  If was gone or disappeared into the clouds in about a minute.   I contacted the police dept and USGS 12 hours later to see if there were any reports and they both said, no.;38.1089318840579;-122.228439130435
