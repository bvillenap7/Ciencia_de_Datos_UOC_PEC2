I was star gazing when I noticed a balloon like object rotating right above me. It was lower then a plane but to high to be balloons. There was no sounds or lights, it was dull gray in color, camoflaged with the night sky. It looked like it had a vibrating or magnetic aura coming off of it.  It moved slowly in a straight path Eastward then disappeared into the night.  The weather was clear and warm, and there wasn't any wind.;38.1089318840579;-122.228439130435
