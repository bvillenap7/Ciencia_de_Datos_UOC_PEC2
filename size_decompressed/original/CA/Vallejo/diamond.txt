While sitting on my patio having my evening cigarette, I noticed what appeared to be an asterism moving rapidly across the sky towards me.  The speed and size was comparable to that of a plane beginning it's descent near an airport.  The asterism outlined the shape of a kite with a short, fat tail. The object made no sound audible to me.  This object flew towards me and over my head, at which point my house blocked further observation. My husband is interested in UFO's, but I'm really not.  When I was in school I studied invertebrate biology, and I generally focus my energies on verifiable facts.   I would be very interested in finding out the nature of the craft (or crafts) I saw this evening.  There is an airforce base nearby, perhaps they were doing some high altitude formation flying?;38.1089318840579;-122.228439130435
