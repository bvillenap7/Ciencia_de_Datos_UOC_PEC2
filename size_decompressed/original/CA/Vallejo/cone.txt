Missile launch?;2015-08-08 19:30:00;20 minutes;Missile launch? Saw missile like launch of 2 objects.  Looked like missiles.  Hung in the sky for a long time before night fall.  Low on sunset horizon.  Watched it and then took sight of aircraft at same time.  Either this was a coincidence or the missile was an aircraft that then flew east.  Used high power binoculars until losing sight of craft over east horizon.  Weird.;38.1089318840579;-122.228439130435
