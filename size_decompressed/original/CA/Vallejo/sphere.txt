Sunning in backyard, small round object, gray and transluscent, incredible speed, 10 to 12 seconds.;2008-10-14 17:00:00;10-12 seconds;Sunning in backyard, small round object, gray and transluscent, incredible speed, 10 to 12 seconds. Sunning in back yard.  Flock of crows flew over and I watching crows when I saw a small round object, dark grey on bottom half and transluscent on upper half and a small barb or tail on rear, zipping at a high rate of speed in a southerly direction.  Watched for about 10 seconds and at the split second it seemed to vanish it changed direction, almost a reverse motion, perhaps 145 to 160 degrees, and continued in a NW direction at the same rate of speed it had been traveling and then disappeared after about another 2 to 3 seconds.  Scatterd clouds in background but otherwise bright and sunny.  Saw the object clearly.  Appeared to have one or two vertical ribs in the upper half and possibly one horizontal rib in the lower half. Estimated speed 500 to 1,000 MPH but most difficult to guess the distance.  Appeared to be the size of a baseball but impossible to tell.;38.1089318840579;-122.228439130435

Two small objects flying in formation and what appeared to be an F series fighter plane chasing them.;2014-05-05 09:40:00;2 minutes total;While at the ATM on Santa Clara St in Vallejo CA, I heard a thundering loud noise which sounded to me like a fighter plane flying by.   I looked up in the sky and saw two small objects flying in formation and what appeared to be an F series fighter plane chasing them.  I saw them again flying over Fortune St in Vallejo, this time I got a better look at them.  They looked like two silver spheres.  And the fighter was still chasing them.
