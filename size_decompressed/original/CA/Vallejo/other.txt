From our position, it looked like the size of a basketball in contrast to the sky- so, im guessing its a lot larger than. It did not morph or change colors- it just sailed across and dissapeared. oh and it did have a tail on it, but dissappeared when the orb dissappeared.;38.1089318840579;-122.228439130435
Jet black an so quite an so so big.  ((anonymous report));2013-06-30 00:00:00;2 minutes;Jet black an so quite an so so big. It was a clear night as the moon shining on some small clouds above me.  As i was looking at the costillation, i noticed an object in the sky as the moon reflected its light on a jet black object.  I can see the lines that gave it a horses shoue shap as it passed by the cloud that was light up.  This thig was so big an made no noise as it passed over me.  It was about two hundred feet high and i can see the lines that ran parll from one end to end.  It moved so slow as i stood there amazed by how black it was an how straight the lines were that made its shap.  It was as big as two aircraft carrers on each side an i felt an smell electricity an passed over me going north east.
