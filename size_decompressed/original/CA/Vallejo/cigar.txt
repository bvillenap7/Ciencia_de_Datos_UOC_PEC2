Several objects seen in formation to the northeast of Vallejo California.;2000-07-23 18:02:00;30 MIN;Several objects seen in formation to the northeast of Vallejo California. Watching contrail buildup, I noticed an object in the northeast.  About 60 degrees from plane, a silvery hockey puck shaped object hovering.  I got my son and wife after a few minutes, to also look, and it had become several objects together.  They were grouped in a geese formation.  It reminded me of one of the famous Mexico sightings that were caught on video tape.  They moved off rather slowly, to the northeast, then disappeared from sight. A few minutes later, two Air Force jets (DC-10s?)took off.  They seemed to be vectored in the direction that the objects were last seen by us.;38.1089318840579;-122.228439130435
