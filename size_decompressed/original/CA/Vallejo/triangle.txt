triangle with four circular lights within moved in unorthodox patterns across the sky 4-5,000 feet above our heads;1998-10-25 19:30:00;45 seconds;triangle with four circular lights within moved in unorthodox patterns across the sky 4-5,000 feet above our heads It was evening and my family were walking around outdoors at the Marine World Theme Park in Vallejo, CA. Looking up at the sky I noticed a triangular shaped object slowly moving across the sky. It seemed to be interested in our area on the ground. Probably 4,000 feet in altitude.  It would move in different directions, hover, move another direction, hover, move. No noise was emitted from object. There were four distinct circular lights within the triangle. Then all of a sudden it darted at high rate of speed out of sight. Other park visitors witnessed the sighting too. My wife, son and daughter all viewed object as I did. We spoke about it all the way home from Vallejo to San Lorenzo. Never could forget it even to today. Strange sighting but true. Unexplainable. Looked in newspaper the next day but nothing was reported.;38.1089318840579;-122.228439130435

Triangle shaped craft with orange lights flew quickly and silently.;2013-11-05 19:22:00;10-12 seconds;Triangle shaped craft with orange lights flew quickly and silently. November 5, 2013, UFO Sighting At approximately 19:22 hours,  I was on the roof of the employee garage, headed to move my car (while I was on break) and grab a notebook for work.  As I walked toward my car, which was on the far end of the roof, I looked up and noticed something moving toward my direction in the sky.  At first it wasn't clear what it was.  As it approached, I noticed that it was moving rather quickly, and as it started to pass over me I noticed the shape. It was a triangular shaped craft, with dim orange-ish lights at each of the three points, and was dark in color (black?) as it matched the night sky.  I turned my body and followed the craft as it passed nearly directly over me.  I managed to shoot my arm out and measure the size with my thumb the rear two lights were visible from both sides of my thumb.  The craft seemed to move in a straight line toward a North Easterly direction (From San Francisco toward the Sacramento area).  It took about 10-12 seconds to pass from when I first noticed it.  I didn't have time to get my phone camera on to take a shot, but I did call my co-worker and told her what I saw. My heart was racing and I was trying to comprehend what I had just seen. It hit me that there was no sound from the craft. In fact, the area was rather quiet, and the wind was pretty calm.  There was no strobe light on the craft, and the dim orange colored lights were solid and didn't flash or blink.  It also struck me at how fast the craft was moving while not making a sound. I’m not going to assume that this was an alien spacecraft based off of what I saw. I know there are new stealth craft being tested and there are several military bases in the area. But the size, speed, and lack of sound have me puzzled.  I've lived near military bases all my life and have seen many different types of aircraft. I have several friends who are pilots and have been up close and personal with many modern and WWII era aircraft.  I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like this before. Note: I returned to my car, to retrieve the notebook I forgot, after I moved it closer to my department.  I noticed a Cessna type aircraft fly almost directly over me (not as direct as the UFO did), but in a different direction than the UFO, and noticed several things:  The speed of the UFO was at least three times as fast as the Cessna type craft.  Stretching my thumb out at arm’s length again, I noticed the wingspan just barely cleared either side of my thumb, but the UFO was more than twice the altitude of the Cessna type craft.  There was a distinct sound from the engine of the Cessna type craft as it passed over me, which the UFO made no sound at all as it passed.  The Cessna type craft had strobes and marker lights (red and green on either wing), and I could see a dim light from the cabin (it was lit up pretty well).  I could tell that the Cessna type craft was white, whereas the UFO blended in with the sky, except for the orange lights.;38.1089318840579;-122.228439130435
