This sighting was in the summer 1970 or 71, I was only a teen at the time and didn't take notes of the event.I was in the back seat and due to the hot weather I had been holding my head partially out of the window to cool down, as we approached a stop sign my eye's caught the glimmer of something directly in front of us in the sky, I focused my attention more at this and was assuming it was a box kite, but I realized quickly is wasnt swaying in the wind nor had string or tail attached, I then assumed rather oddly that it was a water tower and looked for girders or beams holding this thing up in the air, then I suddenly realized what I was seeing and imediatly brought this to the attention of my cousin in the front seat,We both watched this thing for about 30 to 45 seconds. The object was shiney on the upper section and rather darker on the under side due to being shaded from the sun, however arrayed around both upper and lower sections were dark panels, those panels on the shaded underside were more pronouced then those on the more shiney upper section. The object never moved during this whole duration then suddenly shot in a northerly direction with a speed that was astonishing... being stunned at this tremendous acceleration I yelled at my cousin  ..did you see that !!...  he said yes it disappeared,I said  no it didnt it shot to the north like a bullet  this object never made a sound, and no shock wave was heard. My cousin wore glasses and I don't know if contributed to his failure to not see the sudden acceleration of this object .......in later years when I began to look into this phenomena I looked over this area on maps and noted there was a Naval Air Station very near the area of this sighting. I have refrained from reporting this sighting due in part to the unfortunate witnessing of other objects dureing other times in my life, realizing that the chance of seeing one ufo is remote, but to have other sightings years apart is even more remote, how ever I will submite these other reports also so that perhaps others whom might have witnessed the same object during those time frames might have some comfort knowing they were not alone, and I would gladly take a polygraph in all reports that I have submited.......;37.3986;-120.8705
