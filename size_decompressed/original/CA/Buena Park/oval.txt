6 Dimly Lit Ovals Fly over Buena Park Area as a Cluster then become a V Formation;2014-10-16 20:23:00;20 seconds;6 Dimly Lit Ovals Fly over Buena Park Area as a Cluster then become a V Formation At approximately 20:23 on October 16, my boyfriend and I were walking up the long driveway to our apartment. I looked up into the night sky and saw a cluster of ovals. There was one oval by itself and to the right of that oval was a cluster of five ovals in an oval shaped cluster. At first glance, they seemed to be floating. Momentarily I thought they might be Mylar balloons, but then realized that each oval was floating away from each other on purpose and there was a very dim circle of lights around each oval. I started to shout, Look, look, look to my boyfriend.  As I was shouting for him to look up, the ovals purposely moved into a V formation, very similar to what a flock of birds looks like when flying long distances. The singular oval craft stayed to the left of this formation and then the entire group of ovals picked up speed.  During this entire time, there was no sound of any kind being emitted by these objects.  They did not fly like a plane...  They propelled forward, but could also move from side to side or up and down.  It took less then 2 seconds to get into the V formation. By the time my boyfriend spotted them in the sky they were already in the V formation and flying away. They flew away from where we were and just appeared to disappear into the sky, like the sky swallowed them.;33.8680762711865;-117.992116949153
