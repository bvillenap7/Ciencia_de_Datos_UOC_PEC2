formation of four circles flying at 1000 feet above amusement park in Buena Park, CA;2006-10-28 12:15:00;10 secs;formation of four circles flying at 1000 feet above amusement park in Buena Park, CA I sighted something which appeared as 4 circles in a square formation moving together as if part of a single craft.  The object seemed to be just drifting only a few hundred or maybe 1,000 feet over the ground.  This occurence was over an amusement park called Knotts Berry Farm and several other people saw it as well. It passed across the sky momentarily. moving slowly, and then disappeared.  The lights were bright white and the sky was clear, and there was also an airplane passing in another direction much higher above this object, therefore I am sure it was not a search light, helicopter, or other aircraft.;33.8680762711865;-117.992116949153
