Metallic, triangular object spotted above Knott's Berry Farm 11/10/06 at 9:45pm.;2006-11-10 21:45:00;1 minute;Metallic, triangular object spotted above Knott's Berry Farm 11/10/06 at 9:45pm. My boyfriend and I were at Knott's Berry Farm.  At 9:45pm, we saw this object hovering in the sky, approximatly 15-20 degrees up from the horizon.  It was triangular shaped, but appeared to be changing shape from triangular to pyramid to rectangular shaped.  This may have been due to the object rotating I couldn't tell.  It alternated between hovering like a balloon and moving erratically back and forth.  There was a blue light coming out of the bottom, but the entire object had a blue haze about it, as if it were being backlit by a blue light.  The object was silvery metallic on the outside.  It started moving away from us and went out of view behind a building.  We ran around the building to see it better, but it had disappeared.  As stated above, we were inside Knott's Berry Farm as they were closing.  There were other people around, but no one seemed to notice it except for us.;33.8680762711865;-117.992116949153
I want some answers.......................;2009-01-18 20:00:00;15 min;I want some answers....................... I was in my back yard and decided to water the front yard and have a smoke. I looked south down my street and saw to the left of me the brightest largest moon I have ever seen- it was  so big it lookedlike it was just miles away- then I thought what the hell...the moon is 1/4  maybe right now..I looked again and it looked like there was explosions of some sort on the face of the moon planet thing..I saw other planes ( obvious) fly right up next to it and hover..3 on each side..in formation- this moon light thing hovering was changing colors and had shadows of some sort over it- resembling an easter egg my brother threw in the purple..made a weird color. the thing hovered - always being followed by the 6  by standing planes..I live in the run way to LAX..and I see planes all the time..this wasnt a plane..as a matter of fact there were no planes I could see directed into LAX - the sky was blank- except this light moon thing..I turned around and saw my shadow thatis how bright it was..I called my daughter- to come see- she ignored me at first then I guess my tone- to come here now- she got up and her first questions is...whatis that? is that the moon being attacked? We saw it go out of sight..honestly it was very very very very unsettling. What is going on? How can a guy in Belarus- see the very same object 8 days ago?;33.8680762711865;-117.992116949153
