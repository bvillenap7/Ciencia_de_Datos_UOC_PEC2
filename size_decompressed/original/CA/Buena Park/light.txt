I was too afraid to report the sighting untill now. Well I was 10 at the time (young but still sure of what I saw) I am very creitable, was am on the honor roll at Buena Terra School, And am in a gifted and talented class.The object was pure white unlike anything I've ever seen, their was no noise except a very quiet humming sound it came from the left moved back and forth 3 time probley, and disapeared to the left. It must have been 5 feet off the ground, I have no idea how big it was but I think it might of been in the area of 3-4 feet. The blinds that were covering the glass door were closed so all I could see was the light and almost nothing else. Later that night I was still very shaken up when I saw a humanoid figure, I say humanoid because the head was much too big and it was only  about 4 feet tall, it had a amazingly smoth stride, almost like it was walking on air. I left the mini-blinds closed out of pure fear so all i ever did see were shadows but I know what I saw wasn't human.I've been afraid to report it out of fear my family would think I was nuts, because the next day when I told my family none of them belived me.For this reason I ask that you not call and only contact me be mail or e-mail,((Name deleted)) ((NUFORC:  Similar incident reported by Cameron, MO, Police Dept. for 21JN95.));33.8680762711865;-117.992116949153

3 very bright lights in triangle formation move across sky;2011-05-15 10:20:00;8 minutes;3 very bright lights in triangle formation move across sky 3 bright lights, brighter than any aircraft I've seen, in a askew diamond triangle shape move a cross the sky.  They were on the same plane not just randomly placed.  They went the same direction and didn't move formation at all.  They never stopped and just kept going to out of sight.  There were helicopters flying about so you can distinguish the lights between the 3 bright ones and other aircraft.

I was eastbound on 91 Freeway.  At first, there were 3 the one in the center had a bright white light then the other two evenly spaced apart on both sides.  Those two were lighter multi color lights, then near the center one another one appeared all at the same elevation across the Eastern skyline.  The appear to be near the Santa Ana Mountain Range from where we are.  When we walk they start appearing anytime after 20:15 and will last up to as late as 23:00.  We have scene as many as 5 or 6 one night. With one other person walking.  Many people in our area say they have scene them.   The same night when I picked up my roommate her friend was watching it also.  To the North of these Objects is the airline up for LAX so they are not airplanes they stay still!   When I first saw it and called into Coast to Coast and most likely to see it is a Jr High School we walk the track do South of KFI transmission Antenna.  FYI;33.8680762711865;-117.992116949153
