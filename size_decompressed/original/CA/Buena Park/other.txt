Bright star like object overhead that went dim, then disappeared from the sky.;2003-10-19 21:30:00;15 seconds;Bright star like object overhead that went dim, then disappeared from the sky. Approx. 730pm I ventured outside my home in a suburban neighborhood and looked up. I immediately noticed a very bright blue/white star above about 80 degrees. I thought gee, I didn't know Jupiter was visible this time of evening. As I stared at it for several seconds and pondered of retrieving my telescope, it suddenly got dimmer. I thought, this is what a pulsar or binary might look like, when suddenly the object began moving towards the north becoming dimmer every second until no longer visible.  I have seen many jets, major pathways are overhead, I have seen satellites that move across the sky, but I have never seen an object such as this move like it did. Someone please tell me what I saw, I am very curious?;33.8680762711865;-117.992116949153
Square-shaped object spinning.;2015-07-09 15:00:00;30 seconds;Around 3:00PM, I looked up in the sky and saw a square shaped object, spinning in the sky.  It was pretty big it was for a good 30 seconds at least.   The sun was reflecting off of it and there were no clouds around it vanished moments later because I was distracted.   My friend saw it with me and her description was the same as mine, large square shaped object spinning in the sky.
