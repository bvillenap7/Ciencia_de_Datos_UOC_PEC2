A round orb with flashing lights near Highway 1 coming into Morro Bay.;2003-01-07 21:20:00;2 minutes;A round orb with flashing lights near Highway 1 coming into Morro Bay. My girlfriend and I were driving home from a movie in San Luis Obispo.  At Cuesta College we saw an obscure yellow light in the distance.  As we got closer and closer, we could make out that the light was moving.  When we could see the Morro Bay smoke stacks in front of us, the aircraft flew overhead, across the highway.  It was an orb-like shape with many flashing lights on it.  It wasn't that far overhead, and it wasn't moving as quickly as a normal craft.  We pulled off to the side of the road and saw the craft fly over the mountain on the other side of the highway. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness meant to indicate the year, 2003.  We have sent a query to him, and tentatively have amended the date here.  PD));35.3787;-120.8457

Bright shiny metallic sphere moving slowly for 1 minute and stopping suspended for 2 min;2021-07-02 15:00:00;3 minutes;Bright shiny metallic sphere moving slowly for 1 minute and stopping suspended for 2 min Upon climbing the steps from my home to the street above I spotted a highly reflective, shiny metallic sphere approximately 500+ yards in the blue sky drifting slowly south over the hill just east of the ocean. The object made no sound that I could hear and left no trail. As I watched, it stopped after about 1 min of slow drift and stayed stationary as I watched for another couple of minutes. I then retreated to my house to grab my binoculars and it had disappeared. The wind was moderate onshore to the east with scattered low clouds.;35.3787;-120.8457
