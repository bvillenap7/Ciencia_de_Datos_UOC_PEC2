A bright light was seen at 12 o'clock (north), at a 15 degree angle above the horizon.  At first glance, the light looked liked the very bright landing light of an airplane, but it did not move.  The light gradually got dimmer and dimmer and I lost sight of it.  It maintained its hovering position during the observation. ((NUFORC Note:  A duration of 30 minutes seems clearly to rule out a landing light on an approaching airliner.  We do not know what the witness observed.  PD));35.3787;-120.8457
