I went inside my house to get a camera and when I came out my friend hollared at me and told me that it stopped in the sky and that it was just glowing.  I seen it and started taking pictures of it but then realized that I had no film in my camera so i just used the flash from the camera to try to get its attention.  After flashing twice with the camera's flash it was responding to use with flashes the same way we were flashing at it. It then moved closer to us and kept flashing even when we didn't flash back.  We could see an outline of the ship it was diamond shaped and it had no windows it had a glowing bottom that pulsed with yellow and whitish tint.  It made no sound and it just kept flashing at us 2 times.  Then it speeded away at incredible speed to where it just disappeared.;36.5466;-119.3353
