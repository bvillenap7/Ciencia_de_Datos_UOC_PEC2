A bright white round object with no specific outlines due to the reflection and altitude.;2007-06-28 11:00:00;5 minutes;A bright white round object with no specific outlines due to the reflection and altitude. I was looking up at the mast of my sailboat and I saw a bright round object stationary, (cantaloupe size) against the bright blue sky.  It stayed stationary approximately one minute then moved slowly southward.It then took on a metalic type reflection as it moved further away from the Sun. Suddenly it accelerated at a tremendous speed and sped further south going up and over the Piute mountains. It was clearly outlined against the dark mountains as it disapeared. I am a retired electrical enngineer.;35.669;-118.457
