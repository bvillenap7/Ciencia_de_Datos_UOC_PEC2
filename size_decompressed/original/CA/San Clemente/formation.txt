Mysterious formation over South Orange County Skies.;2015-09-27 20:30:00;25-40 minutes;Mysterious formation over South Orange County Skies. Looking up at tonight's blood moon, a group of us neighbors noticed a strange constilation in the night sky,  as we were looking at it we all began to notice the objects were moving and changing formation patterns, not planes, these we see daily, and all hours of night.  They appeared as stars, but moved slowly and blended in perfectly with the stars above, we saw them from about 4' O'clock high until about 8-9 o'clock high moving in a Southwest to eastern route...I have always been a skeptic but after tonight I am a firm believer...never seen anything like it!  Ever!  Cool and scary to say the least, all because of the unknownâ€¦ Being a military combat veteran, I put everything I have come to know and love about being a US MARINE, this wasn't like anything I have ever seen in my life before, unless we're talking SciFi, than of coarse I can say it looked like ((what)) you would see on Star Track  (sic.  Trek)...simply amazed at what I had witnessed.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.4469999999999;-117.63015
