3 lights close to horizon, 2 lights fade slowly, one very bright, until it vanished.;2001-01-03 19:00:00;about 1.5 hours.;3 lights close to horizon, 2 lights fade slowly, one very bright, until it vanished. Clear skies.  Looking straight out towards the ocean(west) there was one extremely bright light close to the horizon, about 20 degrees.  The light did not move at all for at least 30 minutes.  Then when I checked back at 8:20PM, it was gone.  Two more lights were visible above Catalina Island.  Much lower to the water line than the first light.  One light slowly faded around 7:35, the second faded around 7:45.  There were several airplanes in the area aproximately 15 min after sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness may describe here at least one of the planets that are visible in the early evening.  We do not know what the last two lights were.  PD));33.4469999999999;-117.63015
Video of  strange rotating lights in sky;2004-03-08 00:54:00;1 min. 14 sec.;Video of  strange rotating lights in sky I have been an Accounting Manager with the same firm for 8 years. On March 8, 2004, I was testing a new digital camera I had bought for my upcoming vacation to Hawaii. The camera takes mpeg video as well. At 12:54 a.m., while my boyfriend and I were laying in bed, I had the camera pointed out our bedroom skylight (skylight is 8 ft. x 6 ft) when I noticed a white light in the LCD screen. At first I thought it was a star, but then I realized it was moving, so I thought it might be a comet.  I continued to record for a total of 1 min 14 seconds. When I played the video on my computer at 200% zoom, I was surprised at what I saw.  The object had different colored lights that would change from green to red to blue to yellow, and the lights would appear to be perfectly circular then they would rotate and change into a white streak, then change again into 5 cirular lights each a different color-red green yellow blue purple.  The object could not be seen-just the lights that rotated around it.  I was able to change the contrast and brightness in my media player, and when I did, a second row of lights can clearly be seen above the first, but rotating in the opposite direction. There is a also a strange haze around the object as it moves.  (I would like to add the fact that I have taken into account any possible reflections from the skylight, however,all the lights were off in the house. The only light in the room was from the LCD screen)  I will be forwarding the video to you via U.S. Mail.  I captured stills from the video that I saved as jpegs and will be emailing those to you as well.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
Two orange dancing lights near  San Onofre nuclear reactor;2007-03-15 22:00:00;5-7 minutes;Two orange dancing lights near  San Onofre nuclear reactor Two orange dancing lights.  My brother and I were camping in San Clemente.  We looked southwest towards the San Onofre reactor when we both noticed two orange lights. I could not make out a shape but they looked round from where we were.  I estimate the lights were 15-20 miles from my position and probably out over the Pacific Ocean. We observed two lights moving up and down in alternating times.  When one was up, the other went down, and when one went down the other went up.  I am an airplane and bird fan and I can say for sure this was no plane.  Could it have been a light source from Camp Pendleton? Maybe.  But, how would the light reflect so far and off of what would the light be reflecting off of?  I think the light source originating from Camp Pendleton is not reasonably probable. The motion of the lights appeared coordinated and under intelligent control.  I think these were two separate objects.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
A long beam of light stretches across the sky.;2009-02-21 00:05:00;ongoing;A long beam of light stretches across the sky. 2/21/09   At midnight I went outside to talk with my girlfriend's brother and he pointed out something in sky.  There was a beam of light stretching over our heads, going from the southwest to the northeast.  The light appeared kind of vague and blurry but as I looked longer the light became more clear.  I'm not sure what this is or how it got there but I am very curious what it is and if it will be back tomorrow night.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
Bright stationary light hovering over ocean in San Clemente, CA.;2013-10-29 22:40:00;still there;Bright stationary light hovering over ocean in San Clemente,CA Bright shining light stationary over ocean past San Clemente Pier.  Through binoculars of 100x magnification a red blinking light is seen along side the upper left side of the light which could be formed by a cluster of lights seeming to change colors.  First seen at approx. 10:40pm and still in sight now at 11:10pm.  Seems to have moved slightly south still over ocean area.  Noticed no other activity in the sky during this time as there is always plane activity from many airports north and south of our location each night.  A thrilling sight to see.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
Bizarre color changing moving light.;2013-11-26 17:15:00;8-10 minutes;Bizarre color changing moving light. We observed a bright light which was slowly changing colors, from blue to green to red to white to orange and back to blue.   It appeared to hover for periods, then it made rapid movements that certainly did not seem possible for any aircraft I know of.  It appeared to be out over the ocean in a west northwest direction from doheny state park.   I am a skeptic, but this was bizarre and unexplainable by me.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
5 bright red oval or squared object hover then accend at extreme speed over San Clemente, CA.;2019-07-06 21:10:00;3 minutes;5 bright red oval or squared object hover then accend at extreme speed over San Clemente, CA. I witnessed 5 separate dark but bright red objects follow the same trajectory.  The first followed by the next.  I spotted them about the height you would see a helicopter approaching towards you.  Then stopped for a milli second before heading up at about a 60 degree angle at an extremely high rate of speed.  I watched each accend until they went out of sight, which took 3 to 5 seconds. The last object followed the same path but was a bit slower in speed. There was no sound other lights or trail.  These were definately seperate distinct objects moving in the same deliberate path. I have never seen anything before that I would descrbe as a UFO.   Also, I observed these immediately following the 7.1 earthquake which hit about 150 miles north in Ridgecrest Ca. My girlfriend caught a video of one but it does not capture what we saw visually.  I describe them as light.  She says they were more squared or rectangled.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
