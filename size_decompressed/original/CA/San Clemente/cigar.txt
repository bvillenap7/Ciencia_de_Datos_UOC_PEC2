No wings no windows, grey color it vanished before our eyes...? On the 405 we saw a very large cigar shape, like a plane with no wings and no windows.  Grey and it was at a slant in the air not much higher than a overpass.  It was very large for a split second I thought a plane was crashing or an immediate landing?  Hovering very low saw the object for 2 seconds maybe 3 and then nothing?  We looked everywhere as fast as we could- nothing?  Very strange.   My husband is a financial advisor.  I’m a retired music manager.  We have never witnessed a UFO but this is something to report it was there and then it wasn’t we are beyond perplexed… ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and she seemed to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a highly capable, and reliable, witness.  PD));33.4469999999999;-117.63015
