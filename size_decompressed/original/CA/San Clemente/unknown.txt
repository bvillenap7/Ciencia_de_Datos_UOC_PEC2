Bright, white/orange light hovers over ocean;2013-09-29 20:00:00;hours;Bright, white/orange light hovers over ocean past several weeks - a strange light out over the ocean - we can see from our patio.  It stays stationary - is much bigger/closer than a start but clearly not an airplane or helicopter.  Through regular binoculars it appears like a small sun or sunburst light - very bright white and orange around edges - seems to flicker.  Appears from our view just over Catalina Island or just south of Catalina.  Lower than stars that are out.  Haven't watched for how long but a few hours then gone.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
3 orangish unknown shapes.;2015-09-25 21:30:00;1-3 minutes;3 orangish unknown shapes 100% Real Sighting and first interest or care of UFO's existence.  Coming home from dinner on September 25th, 2015, at approximately 9:30 pm, we don’t drink or do drugs.   My girlfriend and I were driving up the hill to our house when she said to me, what are those 3 lights?  I replied, probably helicopters as I had no interest.  As we continued up the hill she said again, look, what are those lights?   At this point I looked up to see 3 bright orangish lights in a vertical pattern a considerable distance apart from each other.  I then said, lets stop and watch and see if they are moving, as they just appeared to be hovering.  As we stopped and watched I immediately could notice they were slightly moving but very slow.   Immediately after I noticed they were moving slowly in our general direction, they stopped and appeared to be hovering again.  I still wasn’t too interested until, within a few seconds,I literally blinked and the bottom of the 3 lights had vanis! hed.  Now my eyes were glued to the 2 remaining lights as the bottom light disappeared faster than anything I have ever witnessed or known to exist on earth.  The next two lights and what they did are why I am writing this and now know UFO's 100% do exist. 3  The top light in the pattern of 3 lights, which is now 2 lights remaining, I watched disappear approximately 10-20 seconds after in a directly upward and out direction at a speed not from this earth.  The large bright light I could see fade in a direction, speed and distance that is impossible to be from our planet.  Rockets and Missiles are like a turtle to this speed. It was very close to light speed, just a bit slower and enough to notice direction.  As this happened I expressed my disbelief to my girlfriend and I am not sure if she saw it disappear as it vanished completely within a second or two.  However, now both our eyes are glued to the middle of the 3 lights and last one remaining.  Within 10-20 seconds the middle and last remaining light, which was a good distance lower than the top light, began to move in that same direction at a similar speed.  As we both watched the light vanish into outer space within a few seconds, exactly like the top light, we knew what we j! ust saw together was impossible to be anything known to exist from this planet.  My girlfriend will submit her sighting report in her own words and neither of us care if anyone believes what we saw.  We know what we saw and it has shocked our world;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
