((HOAX??  Date is illogical))  Disc-shaped object witnessed.;1990-02-28 22:00:00;30 minutes;It was my first night moving into my new house in san clemente.My brothers and friends had just left from helping me move into my house.I was outside,standing on my lawn,looking to the west (about 3 blocks from the pacific ocean) I noticed something just beneath the cloud cover,over the coast.A saucer shaped disc,with multi-colored lights on the edge of the object.The object seemed to hover and spin,so the lights were changing colors from blue,green,and yellow.It seemed to be fuzzy at times,then come into view. I watched it for about 10 minutes........I was trying rationalize that it was a balloon or something I could explain.I got into my truck,and drove down to the beach.....when I got there,it was gone.I know what I saw was a disc shaped object,and I could see it very clearly.Even though I have waited close to 18 years to report this..I KNOW WHAT I SAW!!

A quick round like craft in the sky and vanishing when i knoticed it while walking at night.;2004-04-15 23:00:00;About 10 seconds;A quick round like craft in the sky and vanishing when i knoticed it while walking at night. As walking down the street i look up to see a round like craft with a blueish/green auora and it happened to vanish as i looked in the sky and knoticed it's presense. This isn't the first time this has happened in san clemente, there has also been various reports and other witnesses who have seen the same objects at night or so with the quickly vanishing objects in the skys. I wish there could be a real explination for it.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
