One by one a the lights formed a massive circle in the sky over our town. But once in a while a red light would go up next to one of the white lights in the circle and immediately the white light and the red light turned into all colors again and blinking and communicating whith each other. But then the red light left the circle and continued searching the neighborhood. This setting went on for so long and  eventually my husband and I went in the house - straight to bed - I was so tired and my neck was hurting from looking UP all that time.

White/Blue Rectangular object over Orange County CA changed shape, searchlight pointed at object.;2008-09-20 21:00:00;10 mins +;White/Blue Rectangular object over Orange County CA changed shape, searchlight pointed at object. Me and my whole family saw a rectangular shaped bright object in the night sky over Orange County. It changed shape from rectangular to a twisted looking shape then back. Kind of like a rubrics cube twisting. The object was changing colors but was over all very bright whiteish blue. Kind of like looking at a huge high def TV around 5000 feet. It was above the clouds. Didnt look like anything any of us had ever seen.  Someone inland fired up a spotlight and pointed it at the clouds below the object. The rectangular twisting light source continued a sort of accent untill it was a dot against the sky like a star. VERY STRANGE. Cant find any news and im getting frustrated because im sure lots of people saw it + someone pointed a searchlight at it. Hope to find others who witnessed this.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
