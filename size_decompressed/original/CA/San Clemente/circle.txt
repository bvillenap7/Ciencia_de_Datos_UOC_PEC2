I went outside to see and listen there was no sound.  An airplane was flying by at same time and heard that.  Both orbs slowly came to a stop, one disappeared first then the other a few seconds later.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015

I live in Rancho San Clemente, Pacific Shores neighborhood.  My home has an clear ocean view.  I was looking out from 2nd story large bedroom bay window, when I saw the bright reddish/orange balls in a line on the water.  Figured it must be a military exercise, since I live near Camp Pendleton, and went to bed.   Had second thoughts this morning and decided to report what I saw.  Hope it helps in some way.   Thank you. - ((name deleted));33.4469999999999;-117.63015

Right before it hit us, it swerved around driver's side.  Three glowing ligjts.  You could hear the hum of motor.  Then it was behind us for a few seconds then passed by the passenger window and disappeared.  I have video of it.  I will attempt to email it to you.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
