9 light grid floating by silently, 3 rows of 3 red lights.;2007-04-02 23:00:00;1 hour;9 light grid floating by silently, 3 rows of 3 red lights. Standing on balcony looking west over pacific ocean, commanding 180 degree view. Notice Venus-like, bright, white light low in north-northwestern sky. The light is stationary for first few minutes of observation, then moves steadily west to take up new stationary position less than a hand's width away with extended arm. Light still looks very far away, beyond airspace.  The light suddenly starts to behave--morphing from a single white light into a circle and then a vertical line before returning to its original form, a single white, star-like light. The light then begins to vibrate and appear blurry. Out of the blur materializes/emerges a single red light, not blinking, that is suddenly within proximate airspace and clearly moving south down the coastline. At this point the single red light is approximately 50 miles north and within a minute it is much closer, approximately 5-10 miles, still moving south slowly and steadily.  At this distance, what was once a single red light is becomes four red lights, each one a corner of a perfect square. As the lights pass at their closest, directly out at eye level (approximately 200 ft above sea level), the side view is of 9 red lights, 3 rows of 3 red lights in a perfect square moving evenly and SILENTLY at an approximate distance of less than a quarter mile.  The 9-light grid continues steadily southward down the coastline, and now the rear view is again four red lights, each the corner of a square, except now with one extra in the middle of the square, so now 5 lights moving at the same steady, unwavering, silent pace. Approximate size at closest view 50ftx50ft.  Extra wrinkle: Enter apartment after losing sight of lights, walk into kitchen, hear audible click from electric range, open oven door to find broiler coil glowing orange and fully engaged though oven controls all off and indicator light off. Oven/range off, broiler coil red hot!?;33.4469999999999;-117.63015

Then, I saw a silverish-whitish thing floating high in the sky.  It was traveling up gracefully, kind of like a balloon.  I watched it for about 10 seconds because I had never seeing anything like it before and was trying to figure out what it was. Then, it slowly faded away.  I thought maybe it was a plane hitting the sun at an angle that made it disappear.  About 20 seconds later it appeared in the same area again.  It traveled upward again very gracefully and then disappeared.  I did see some birds in the sky, but they were much lower.  This could not have been a bird - it was way to high.  It disappeared and reappeared 4 times.  I was driving where there are many high hills and twisting roads so I eventually lost track of the area it was.  I concluded that it could not be a plane because a plane travels upwards and forwards, this was just t! raveling upwards.  I am a mother of two and a teacher.  I would not make this up.  Maybe it was some sort of reflection?  In appearance, it was not at all like the stories of UFOs I have heard of in the past.  Hmmm . . . . . ?;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
