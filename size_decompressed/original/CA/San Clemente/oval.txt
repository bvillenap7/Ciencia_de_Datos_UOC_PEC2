They seemed to be chasing each other.  In pulsating and moving slowly.  Bright orange light, much brighter than the surrounding city lights. Just above the mountain top and definitely in air.  They would pulsate and some of the shapes after pulsating would be located in a much further position and then sometimes after pulsating return back close to their starting position/ location.
