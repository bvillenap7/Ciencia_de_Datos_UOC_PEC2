A very recent Foo Fighter following  a small plane. Maybe pilot reported.;2008-11-08 16:00:00;45 sec;A very recent Foo Fighter following  a small plane. Maybe pilot reported. I am reporting this the day after the event. I was at a wedding last night and I went outside to smoke. I was with the security guard and we both witnessed what I would describe as a classic foo fighter. We both saw a small, simple, and typical private propellar plane being flanked by an orb that was definitely following it. It was on the left side of the plane and maybe fifty feet lower but moving at the same pace, as if observing the plane. It was glowing in a red-orange way but was not blinking. It kept following the plane over the horizon and then we lost sight of it. Intersetingly, a few minutes later a plane was in the same exact location (following the shoreline) was moving east (the opposite direction of the plane before). Possibly this story could be linked to a sighting given by the actual pilot. It is possible that the pilot was so spooked by the follower that the pilot went back to base. I am not really sure how I would verify it but if anyone knows I would suggest they check the exact time I have given and as a lead the plane might have came out of John Wayne Airport. As a side note, the security officer who watched the event with me, who works these by the beach weddings all the time, was not as excited as I was. I don't know the date, but he claimed that one evening, at about 9:30pm, the whole wedding party stopped and stared, including the live musicians, and watched a very strange object move through the sky that looked like a fish swimming. He said that this encounter was much more of an unexplainable experience. Personally, I have a lot more respect for people that claim to see really strange things, be they UFOs of ghosts, etc. I have no idea what I saw but I was really in a way feel blessed to have seen something so unexplainable in an age where things in general have mostly been explained. A side note: Of course no one at the wedding believed a bit of my story,even though I had a witness. They all assumed that I drank to much, but I was part of the entertainment and was sober at the time, as I can at best say about the security guard. I really have sympathy now with those that experience something bizzare yet get disfranchised mentally for reporting it. This is not the first time I have seen a UFO. Somehow I feel that this makes this story lose credence, but I am honest about everything. In 1993,I witnessed the Vulkin Crusier. Sorry if I didn't spell it right but I don't follow Star Trek. It was the exact UFO that was seen in Belgium. I watched it with a witness for five minutes, and it was huge! I have seen stealth bombers while going through the desert and I was definitely way larger. It never did any strange manuvers, it just moved in a straight line though it was strange to watch as it slightly moved left to right as it glided by. It was pure gray, had three red lights on each corner that did not flash, and one additional red light on the center that also did not flash. There was no way it was a plane. It was way larger and it also made no sound. It eventually disappeared over a hill so I never saw a disappearance. Was it alien? Was it military? I have no idea. All I can do is report this as more UFO heresay.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
Foo fighters in San Clemente on 11-08-08, did you see something?;2008-11-08 19:00:00;45 sec;Foo fighters in San Clemente on 11-08-08, did you see something? I am sad that you never wrote this case into your site. I am referring to the November, 08,2008 sighting I reported of a basic foo fighter that was following a small private airplane along the coast. I think the plane was spooked as a couple of minutes later it appeared to have turned around and was heading apparently home. The next week, as I am a college English teacher, I told the story to my students and honestly by chance one of my students happen to be in Dana Point at the basic time and date I saw the UFO. She and the ones she was with saw the same object as it seemmed minutes before I did. It is a very lucky situationthat we may have seen the same thing, but she claims to have seen the same thing. Dana Point is just north of the city of San Clemente, and as the object was moving along the coast, I surmise that she saw it a few minutes before I did. That would make the total of people that saw this at least five. Most interesting is the security guard I witnessed the UFO with (I saw this at a wedding reception where he works) and he said that he had seen stranger one night in the past. I was at Ole Hanson in San Clemente. It is an older place that offers a place for weddings and has a pool for public swimming. Anyways, he told me that during one wedding reception everything stopped, including the music, because in the sky there was something he described as an organic, moving like a fish swimming, object that moved across the sky. He said that was much wilder than what we shared. So, I know this is not the best encounter, but I hope you mention it as maybe others have seen both my experience and the one the security guard did in the past.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015

Bright Orange Lights Triangular San Clemente, Ca, June 25th, 2014,.  Split into 14 Spheres.;2014-05-25 23:00:00;5-6 minutes;Bright Orange Lights Triangular San Clemente, Ca, June 25th 2014, Split into 14 Spheres Driving 5 fwy south, through San Clemente, just before Avinida Pico, I saw 3 spheres that were bright orange, like on fire, holding pattern in the shape of a sideways triangle, they were not moving in a pattern of a plane, they were moving down south, they went behind some hills, by the time I made it to san Onofre, saw them again and there were 10 to 14 spheres holing the same fight pattern, as I came to san onofre power plant, they were to the East and disappeared over the hill where the power plant lines go, across. They looked like bright orange spheres, like fire, with billowing white smoke coming off each one.  It was hard to see a shape behind lights, not sure, what it was.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
Dazzling reflective white spherical object;2017-11-20 16:00:00;3 seconds;Dazzling reflective white spherical object At 4:00PM on Monday 11/20/2017, I was driving through San Clemente, CA. on US Highway 5.  Passing Exit 78 (Camino de Estrella), I noticed an aerial object in the northwest sky, brightly reflecting the soon to be setting sun.  The object was northwest of me, at about 30 degrees above the horizon, perhaps over San Juan Capistrano.  I observed this object without interruption for about three seconds, during which time it appeared motionless in front of the distant clouds.  The apparent shape was like a brilliant white bb with an apparent diameter of about 2mm.  My viewing was interrupted by a tree passing through the line of sight, after which the object was nowhere to be seen.  The nearest METAR data from John Wayne airport (about 25 miles northwest of my position) recorded visibility as 10 statute miles and a few clouds at 15000 feet.  If the line-of-sight distance to the object was 5 miles, then it would have had a diameter of about 75 feet and been at an elevation somewhat above 10,000 feet.   Its near-instantaneous disappearance eliminates the possibility of either a reflective balloon or aircraft.;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
