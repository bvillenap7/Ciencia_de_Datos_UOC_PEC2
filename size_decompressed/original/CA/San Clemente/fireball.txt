Ufo sighting off of south orange county coast;2010-09-25 21:43:00;2-3mins;Ufo sighting off of south orange county coast My wife and myself were smoking a cigarette on our patio, when I noticed an orange flame-like object which I thought might be a plane on fire, since it seemed to have a whitish smoke trail that dissipated almost immediately.  It was flying from the northwest on a low trajectory, looked like maybe five miles out over the ocean.  When I first saw the object,it seemed to burn brightly, and when it came closer,it dimmed and then shot of at a quick climbing trajectory to the southwest.Ran inside to grab the camera,but it was gone pretty quick. San Clemente sits adjacent to camp pendleton marine base just to our south,but I know they only fire artillary that we've heard but never seen,and this seemed to come from laguna beach or dana point when I first spotted it.  San Clemente Island located about 50 miles to our southwest is used as a bombing range, so I wonder if this was a rocket from Vandenberg Air Force base way to our northwest.   Any info you could find would be! helpful, otherwise I think i might have just become a believer, and so would my wife!;33.4469999999999;-117.63015
