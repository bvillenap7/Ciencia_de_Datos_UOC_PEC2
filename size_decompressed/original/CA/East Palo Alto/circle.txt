It was an outdoor party and the night sky was very clear. I was eating dinner and I was enjoying the weather at that time. I just finished my dinner and I looked up the sky and there was a lot stars shinning. Suddenly I saw a bright star moving coming from north heading toward south and it was moving at a very good rate of speed. I pointed in out and everyone at the party witnessed the event. I'm not sure what it was, but  I'm 100% sure its not a airplane, this thing was look like a glowing star travelling at very high rate of speed and also its round shape. This could be either a satellite or UFO and I'm pretty sure the are more people witness the event.;37.4651;-122.143
