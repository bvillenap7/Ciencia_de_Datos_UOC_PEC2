Three orange orbs in triangular formation hovering and slowing moving in night sky over East San Jose, the Saratoga hills of South Bay.;2015-08-10 21:09:00;10-30 minutes;Three orange orbs in triangular formation hovering and slowing moving in night sky over East San Jose, the Saratoga hills of South Bay. Mother and adult son witnessed 3 orange glowing orbs hovering in night sky over area which is in front of Mt. Hamilton, vincinity of East San Jose area.   We were on the top of the East Palo Alto IKEA parking garage, preparing to leave, when I commented on peculiarity of the formation of lights sighted.  I am a school teacher, and at first glance, thought the lights may have been planes incoming to one of our 3 major Bay Area airports, however, the lights hovered, did not move in normal gliding pattern of aircraft, and after a minute or so, one orb slowly rose and moved to right above other two orbs.  At first they created an isosceles type triangle, then as one orb moved on top, it created a scalene type triangle.  After watching for a few minutes one orb faded out and disappeared only to flash back on a few seconds later.  The lights were not of constant brightness but glowed brighter and dimmer as they hovered in the slowly changing triangle.   We needed to leave on 10! 1 South, so asked mother if she still saw them.   she said yes as I was driving.  The at that time had moved into a straight line.   We stopped for doughnuts at Krispy Kreme @ Mountain View and did not see lights when we stopped.  As we got back onto 85 North the lights reappeared over the Saratoga area above the mountain range there.  I again determined that they did not appear to be regular aircraft due to the nature of their movement and how they glowed orange with changing intensity of brightness and how they would glow out and come back to light.;37.4651;-122.143
