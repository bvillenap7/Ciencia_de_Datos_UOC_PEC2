not a sound was made from ship but it stoped over  us  and  we could just about throw a rock at it !;2007-05-23 23:45:00;15min;not a sound was made from ship but it stoped over  us  and  we could just about throw a rock at it ! it started out with one light in one spot not moving ,then it made a sudden movement left  up  then back to orignal  spot . not a noise  at all for being as close as a helicopter but no noise. then it started moving towards the house very slowly  but coming and it was close enough  or closer than any helicopter would ever get  ,still no noise.then it stopped on a dime and didnt move for  one minute , then it started  west slowly as another figure started toward our house as it slowly  came up on our house we stood  waiting in aw, then it stopped right above our house for about 5 min  as we seen the other still going west , then  the one above our house slowly went towards the other one   .  from the time they were there till they left two jet like streams in the air . not one noise was made but they were close as a kite would be / never in our lives have we seen anything like it and probably never will again.;40.3690999999999;-122.3375
Another ufo in rural northen California.;2014-07-19 03:00:00;3 hours;Another ufo in rural northen California.  Well, I was playing music with one of my close friends.  The night was winding down it was about 3am.   I step outside of my trailer...  I look up and noticed something not right in the sky.  To my first glance, it looked like the stars were moving.  Not like shooting stars, but in strange patterns.  Nothing like I had ever seen before. I run inside to get my friend and he notices it to.  We observe that the “stars” we see respond to this cloaked ship of ever-changing size and shape.  My friend, not as freaked out about this, went to bed because he had work in the morning.  I stay out there for 3 more hours watching.  Some came very close to me.   The three hours I was out there, it felt like 15 minutes.   Nothing like I have ever seen.;40.3690999999999;-122.3375
