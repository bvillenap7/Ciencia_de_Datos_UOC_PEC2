Lights return after con trails cover the sky with clouds.;2005-08-03 22:00:00;brief;Lights return after con trails cover the sky with clouds. My friend is very disturbed about repeated sightings on his property.  Most recently was the evening of Aug. 3 the day after many con trails were laid down. He saw many lights and huge dark shapes in between.   The reason he is so frightened is that his property is very remote and last September, in the very early morning hours, he saw more lights on his property for many minutes a couple of nights in a row.  He laid in the grass for a half an hour with binoculars and looked at a round craft with many light on top and around it. He gave me a photo he took with a cheap camera and it shows the bottom outline near the rear where the lights appear to be propelling the vehicle away into the night sky.  He drew me a picture of the craft.  As I watched him draw it, I could tell he had studied it very carefully. He said after it went up from behind the trees he studied it at abou 800 to 900 yards up. The top was covered with round lights of a light bulb color and around the perifery were blue flames or jets going down and a red flameing jet in the center. He tried to think to them that he would not shoot at them if they did not harm or bother him. He wishes he could find someone to talk to that lives near by that saw it too. He came to one meeting with me to share with my friends about it, but refuses to talk about it with them again. Since they have returned, talking about it freaks him out.;40.3690999999999;-122.3375
