Bright Green Light over Foothill Ranch, CA - 11/5/08;2008-11-05 00:30:00;0.5 sec;Bright Green Light over Foothill Ranch, CA - 11/5/08 WHEN:  At approximatley 12:30am just past midnight, early Wed 11/5/2008, my colleague & I were driving southbound on CA-241 toll roads. WHERE: Just after passing the Foothill Town Centre area (Lake Forest Drive exit), there was a bright green light that flashed in the clear sky ahead of us.  I estimate it was 1/4 mile to 1/2 mile directly ahead of us, above the middle of the toll road approximatley 100-200 yards above the ground. DESCRIPTION: The light was green, similar to a traffic light, but very bright.  It probably lasted for just 1/2 second to 1 second.  It was so bright that it seemed like it was shining directly at us, similar to when someone shines a flashlight at you.  To me, it appeared that the green light was shaped like a diamond, with its vertical axis 5 times longer than its horizontal axis.  It disappeared without leaving any kind of trail.  We did not see a craft or any physical object - just a bright light. It was late at night and there were no other car headlights visible in our rear view mirror, nor coming towards us from the opposite site of the road.  My coworker and I were chatting when the light suddenly appeared and immediately got both of our attention due to its color, brightness, and location.  Perhaps the object noticed us because it was dark, desolate, and we were traveling pretty fast (80-85 mph). NOTE:  My partner & I are both Federal Agents and we saw the same thing.  It wasn't a helicopter, firework, or anything else we could explain.  There were news reports the following morning that a rocket was fired from Vandenburg Air Force Base, but what we saw was no rocket.;33.6806;-117.6612
