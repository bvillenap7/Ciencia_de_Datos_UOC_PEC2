Colour= burnt-orange, rimmed in a fuzzy neon light blue.   Size= 3 or 4 large stars put together. My dog was cowering about my feet a usual situation when there is wind or storm present. I went outside to check the area. There were no stars visable, as the sky was overcast and misty. There was hardly even a breeze. I, then, saw a squashed-oval object - burnt orange, rimmed in a fuzzy neon light blue, in the upper half of the Southern sky. I thought that it was just a pretty star, robed in mist, until I realized that it was much too big, and moving away. It was about the size of three/four very large stars. Within the course of approx. 10 secs. it grew smaller, and smaller, until it disappeared. My dog's neurotic behavior ceased! I had no idea as to the identity of the object seen.  I am a Naturopath residing/vacationing in California. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) This is a correction of the DATE listed for the previous sighting entry.
