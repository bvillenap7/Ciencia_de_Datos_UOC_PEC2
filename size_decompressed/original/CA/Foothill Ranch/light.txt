Light/Round;2008-02-27 21:45:00;5 Min;Light/Round At 9:45pm my sister called to tell me to look out the window.  She had seen strange lights that looked like a very brite star.  I looked at window in sky and I could see alarge brite light in a shape of a circle.  It moved up and down and sideways. It seemed to shoot off straight sharp lights .  When the straight lights-which when it would shoot the end of the lights that were shot out seemed to end with a small burst.  It kept moving slow and it seemed to fall.  There was another one next to it doing the same thing.  A helicoper showed up and it seemed to dissapear.;33.6806;-117.6612
