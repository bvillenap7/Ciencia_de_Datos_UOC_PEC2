WHITE CIRCULAR LIGHTS;1996-07-01 18:00:00;2 HOURS;WHITE CIRCULAR LIGHTS BACK IN 1996, MY NEPHEW AND I WERE OUT ON A DRIVE IN SEAL BEACH, CA AND THERE WAS A SUMMER STORM THAT SUDDENLY CAME IN. AS WE WERE DRIVING I SAW A CIRCULAR GLOWING LIGHT AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A SPOT LIGHT THEN SUDEENLY IT DIVIDED INTO TWO, THEN FOUR, THEN IT WOULD SHOOT OFF IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT HIGH SPEEDS COME BACK TOGETHER AS ONE THEN DIVIDE AGAIN. THEN WE PROCEDED TO GO HOME BECAUSE THE STORM WAS PICKING UP HIGH WINDS. WHEN WE GOT HOME IN CYPRESS,CA. THATS WHEN THE SIGHTINGS REALLY BECAME BIZARE AND SCARY. IT WAS LIKE THOSE LIGHTS WE SEEN HAD FOLLOWED US AND WERE IN THE CLOUDS, MY NEPHEW SCREAMED FOR ME TO COME OUTSIDE, I DID,LOOKED UP AND THERE WAS ABOUT 15-20 WHITE CIRCULAR LIGHT ABOVE IN THE SKY, ONCE AGAIN IT WAS ONE, THEN IT DIVIDED INTO TWO, THEN MUTIPLES, THEY STARTED TO ROTATE IN A CIRCULAR MOTION THEN THEY WOULD COME BACK TOGETHER THEN DIVIDE THEN SHOOT OFF,COME TOGETHER AND AS THEY CAME TOGETHER THE LOUDEST THUNDER I EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE WOULD ERUPT. WE RAN BACK INTO THE HOUSE, FREAKED OUT, I WENT UP TO MY ROOM TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AS WE LOOKED THERE WERE SO  MANY LIGHTS ALL SIZES FROM SAMLL CIRCULARS TO LARGE SHOOTING AT HIGH SPEED TO ONLY STOP ON A DIME THEN SHOOT OFF AGAIN. THEN AS THE STORM PASSED THE OBJECTS LEFT WITH THE STORM. THAT YEAR I OBSERVED MANY UFO'S BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS A WHITE LIGHT IN A CIRCULAR SHAPE WITH HIGH SPEED AND CONTROL.  SIGHTING TWO. AGAIN MY FRIEND AND I WERE DRIVING HOME FROM THE GYM. WE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME SAID WHAT IS THAT, IT LOOKED LIKE THE GOODYEAR BLIMP WAS FALLING FROM THE SKY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS. THEN AS IT CAME CLOSER TO THE GROUND ABOUT A MILE OR TWO FROM US IT SUDDENLY SHOT UP INTO THE SKY AND DISAPPEARED, MY FRIEND AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SAID WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT.  I NEVER KNEW WHO TO TELL BECAUSE PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WERE CRAZY OR ON DRUGS HALLUCINATING, BUT WE WERE NOT, CLEAN AND SOBER BOTH TIMES. TODAY I JUST CAME ACROSS THIS SIGHT ABD THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE OF VALUE TO YOUR CAUSE. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

However, it disappeared twice, then reappeared from nowhere.  Its color seemed to mimic color of the horizon, grayish blue.  Before  it totally disappeared.  It re-emerged as we drove home  towards same direction.  Very strange.  Definitely not a passenger plane.;33.8205999999995;-118.034
