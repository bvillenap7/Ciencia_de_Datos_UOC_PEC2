I was walking my dog.  No wind.  Clear skies.  No clouds.  No haze.  No marine layers. No fog. Very clear skies with unusually bright stars.  Very little white noise from the city lights.  I happen to look skyward and saw a shape as if a upside down ice cream cone shape.  The object glowed in a very strange array of colors.  Picture a upside down ice cream cone.  It fell from the sky at a perfect straight downward entry. The colors were strange.  First green as if the first scoop of ice cream entering earth.  Then a scoop of brilliant red followed by blue.  The cone part was brilliant purple.  The purple part was the same length as the first 3 colors if measured together.  Strange but true!   I am a Registered Nurse and since seeing this, my normal heart rate has gone from a 72 to over a 100 beats per minute.  I know according to physics that if it was debris or a falling object the color array would be different.  This truly is so very strange.;33.8205999999995;-118.034
