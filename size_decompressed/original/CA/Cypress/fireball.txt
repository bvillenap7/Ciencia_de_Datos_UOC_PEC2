Bright white fireball with a blue tail over Orange County.;2008-06-14 00:00:00;2 seconds;Bright white fireball with a blue tail over Orange County. My wife and I were driving on Cerritos Ave. en route to the 605 freeway onramp.  A bright white fireball shot down from the sky.  Very quick and abrupt. I was the only one to fully witness this quick incident in vivid detail.  My wife saw a flash of brightness from the corner of her eye.  Similar to a shooting star, what I saw was remarkably closer and larger in perspective.  It didn't look to be far away in space but nearby in our sky.  The core was bright white and had a glowing aura of blue. The tail appeared blue as well.  It shot somewhat diagonally in a slight south to north direction and disappeared from my vision behind a cluster of trees.  Rather than streaking across the sky, it gave me the impression that it was crashing down. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
