All craft were spotted in lake county,  california  in a span of about 20 years;1985-08-20 21:00:00;30 minutes;All craft were spotted in lake county,  california  in a span of about 20 years I do not remember the exact date as it was quite a while ago. The craft was a large bright orange ball hovering above the lake Clear Lake. My friend and I watched this object for a good half hour just sitting above the lake. There were no noises of any kind at all. When the craft it it was gone in 5 seconds. The unusual thing too was that I was watching the news two weeks later and the same object was sighted over New Zealand. This was not the first time I have seen crafts in the area as I have seen at least two others in same area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Three vehicles, two small and one large in the rear. approximately 30 to 80 thousand feet leaving a triangle wake. moving from NW to NE;1999-11-16 20:35:00;30 seconds;Three vehicles, two small and one large in the rear. approximately 30 to 80 thousand feet leaving a triangle wake. moving from NW to NE or east. At the NE location a bright fast ball of light came from the south like it was shooting at them at 10 times their speed.  Next day the paper reported ufo's but later said it was space junk. Not sure of the date but could find out! The reason for the altitude is it looked like the height of airliners or higher. Firsted noticed a bright light in the north western sky, then noticed the three objects emiting a v tale like a boat wake.  after traveling across the sky to the northeast is when this bright light, looked like a shooting star came on a 45 degree angle from the south to try and intercept them. Looked like a shooting star.;38.9421;-122.7777
red ball of light in late night sky;2003-07-01 02:00:00;02.00-04.00;red ball of light in late night sky I was talking to my brother outside my bedroom window when from the corner of my eye i seen a bright light in the sky, orange redish and very bright. As i went to look through my other bedroom window for a better view me and my brother both noticed it was moving up and down.It couldnt have been an airplane because it was hovering in place slightly moving in up and down directions and also sideways.It could also not be a helicopter because i would have herd some sort of noise from it because i live in a canyon and i could practically hear a car comming from miles away.It was making absalutely no sound what so ever. It also got very bright at points to were it was alomost white and the went back to its redish orange color and also while we were viewing the ufo i also seen what was a flash of light probably about a quarter mile down the road from were i live, it was like a flash of light like a strike of lightning.;38.9421;-122.7777
Lake County.;2015-04-22 19:00:00;15 minutes;Lake County. A bright light hovered about 4,000 feet above Mt Konocti, and was engaged by at least two military fighter jets.  The dog fight that ensued, lasted for about fifteen minutes.   From my vantage point it appeared that at least one, may both fighter jets were shot down. Many people took pictures and had a better view of the craft.   UFO's fly around this mountain all the time. I usually take it with a grain of salt, but this is the fist time I saw one shoot down one of our jets.  Now it's personal. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the witness, and encouraged him to contact the press, in search of other witnesses to the alleged event, in order to corroborate the report above.  We would like to see more evidence, before we can conclude that a U. S. military jet fighter was, in fact, downed by a flying saucer.  PD));38.9421;-122.7777
Not necessarily UFO's just never seen before!  8 objects perfectly spaced.  ((Spacelink satellites??));2020-02-26 05:05:00;5 minutes;Not necessarily UFO's just never seen before!  8 objects (could have been more just out of sight) perfectly spaced( say a mile apart) following one line easterly over my house.  Could have been military coming from Hawaii or something? there was one light, farther away and offline trailing  the others.  Never seen planes on that flight path, just looking for explanation!;38.9421;-122.7777
