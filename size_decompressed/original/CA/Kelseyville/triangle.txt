So it is slowely and silently hovering past us, and shining it's spotlight all over the place as if searching for something, and even shines it's spotlight on us! then i found out later on by ufo telvisions specials that this same craft same shape and silence, is spotted in other places. then just about a week ago i decided to look up ufos on the internet, when i discover that this same ship with consitant features looks, silence and ability to move slow.has been seen many times in many parts of the world and there are even website sections about that. then last but not least, i bring up topic ufos with a friend of mine at work, and he said he had a ufo encounter, but he wanted to hear mine. so i told him, and he was astonished and said that was exactly like his ufo encounter back in 1979! amazing some people claims it goes fast, changes shape, move back and fowarth rapidly. It didn't do any of that for me, just quite and slow. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1998 is approximate.  PD));38.9421;-122.7777
