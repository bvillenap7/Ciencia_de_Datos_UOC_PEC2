Fireball changing color and size while sitting still and silent.;2012-06-15 21:30:00;10 minutes;Fireball changing color and size while sitting still and silent. We were coming home from the local kelseyville high graduation when i notied a large burning red and orange light right besides the red rotating light on the mt konotci mountain. My wife and mother an sister inlaw all noticed the object also. It sat still then came slowly at us , it dropped to about 1,500 ft because we could see if was about half way below the top of the mountain moving west. The object changed shape from round to oblong and back to round and changing colors from red to orange. Whatever this thing was stopped directly over my house and hovered. We all got out of the car and looked at it , it was silent and very still. After a few minutes it shrunk down in size and moved north east and a unknown speed. It was just to small to judge its speed. We saw this same object over the same exact area about 5 years ago this time. it did exactly the same thing and then moved away from us.;38.9421;-122.7777
