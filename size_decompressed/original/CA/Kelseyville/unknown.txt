My Fiance and I watched for several minutes before it started to very slowly move down the backside of the mountain and disappear.   There was a small personal sized plane with a red flashing light flying around the cove over the water that seemed to be watching it as well.   The object that was extremely bright and slow moving had no other lights just a bright white light.;38.9421;-122.7777
