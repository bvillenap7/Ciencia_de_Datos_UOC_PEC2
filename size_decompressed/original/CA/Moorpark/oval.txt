At first sighting it was rotating above a house then zoomed in closer to me. When my father came out to witness this sighting the object slowly moved steadily off in the distance heading east over Simi Valley.  The object also had an aoura around it. As I was walking outside I noticed a oval, metallic craft rotating above a house I thought to myself if I was crazy. I called my parents they came walking up muttering to themselves Is this kid crazy or what.                                                                                                                                            So, the craft had blinking lights and it was rotating closer. The craft rotated constantly. It was nothing like I have ever seen before. Two airplanes flew over the mysterious object. My parents stared in awe, they called my brother. (Which he stared at it in amazement.) The thing also had a grayish aura around it. Its lights were orange, it's color was silver metallic. After that, it continued it's course east.;34.2827346456694;-118.887501574803
Large reflective oval object hanging motionless above the mountain ridge, north of Moorpark, CA, seen in daylight, at sunset.;2003-07-02 20:10:00;2 minutes;Large reflective oval object hanging motionless above the mountain ridge, north of Moorpark, CA, seen in daylight, at sunset. My husband and I were driving north on Fwy. 23, which links Thousand Oaks to Simi Valley, CA.  The sun was low on the horizon, casting very bright light. Just above the top ridge line of the mountains to the north of us I saw what appeared to be a very large bright light, stationery in sky, but hanging low over the ridgeline.  I joked to my husband, there's a UFO.  He immediately saw it, too.  As we drove, we discussed what it might be, as it was so large and did not appear to move at all.  As we got closer, we could see that it appeared to be less a light, and more an oval-shaped object that was reflecting the sun's rays.  It was very bright, but also had color to it, as though it was reflecting not only the sun's rays, but the colors of the landscape below.  My husband was driving, so he was not watching it as consistently as I was.  As we were continuing to talk about it and my eyes were on it, it suddenly appeared to grow smaller, as though it were receding rapidly. In just an instant it appeared to be a white cigar-shape, then it was gone.  It did not reappear, to our knowledge.;34.2827346456694;-118.887501574803
