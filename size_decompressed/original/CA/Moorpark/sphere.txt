Silver Sphere in Southern California;1994-01-14 18:00:00;appx 5 min;Silver Sphere in Southern California At the time noted my self ((name deleted)), my brother, and our friend witnessed a spherical object hovering in the Eastern sky. It staid dormant for appx 3 to 4 minutes when two smaller, orange-colored spherical objects came towards the larger, silver sphere. One smaller sphere came from a western direction whilst the second came from an eastern direction. Once attention was focused back on the larger sphere, it began to move to left, right, left, right, left, right and disappeared.

Orange glowing sphere traversing the sky and changing course abruptly;2010-08-01 20:20:00;60 seconds;Orange glowing sphere traversing the sky and changing course abruptly Date and exact location are approximate but the event is exact. It was after dark and I observed an orange glowing sphere moving across the sky moving in a straight path sloping downward at about 30 degrees lower than horizontal from right to left.  The degree of luminescence was a little less than the moon on other nights. It was a soft, ember-like glow. The size, while impossible to judge due to no reference objects or clear idea of how far away it was, affected my field of vision in a similar way that a very large plane would have had at about a mile or two away flying at 500 knots.  At first I thought it was a plane, in fact. It had no blinking lights of any kind and was just a glowing sphere.  The straight line path suddenly and abruptly bent into a new straight line path at about 30 degrees more upward than it was, but it still went down towards the horizon until behind trees that blocked my view. Unfortunatley, I didn't think of reporting it or know where to.  (I heard you on Coast To Coast tonite and now know.)    I am a 68-year-old male with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering and am highly trained as a Scientology counselor which training includes extensive observation drills and ability.;34.2827346456694;-118.887501574803
