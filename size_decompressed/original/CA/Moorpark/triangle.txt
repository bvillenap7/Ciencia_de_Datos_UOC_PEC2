We observed the stars and the usual flight patterns of airplanes and other small aircraft. Suddenly a v-shaped (or boomerang shaped object) appeared above us, slightly north, heading east in the sky, then quickly disappeared. It seemed very large, dimly lit, and almost transparent with 4-5 lights on each side. It appeared ghostly, as it did not make a sound, while gliding at a moderate speed.  I witnessed this for 3 seconds, and my boyfriend saw this for 2 seconds. Neither of us has witnessed anything like this before.;34.2827346456694;-118.887501574803
