Five VERY SLOW moving aircraft at mid-day along the coast.;2017-01-04 13:00:00;30 minutes;Five VERY SLOW moving aircraft at mid-day along the coast. On a bright, windless day, driving south along the coast around 1pm, I saw first one, and then a total of five aircraft, make their way down from the coastal mountains, across the highway, and out over the ocean.  There was also a small Cessna type aircraft buzzing up and down the coast. These five aircraft at first seemed small, but then it appeared they were all very large, seen at a distance of a quarter mile.  They were somehow very dark, too dark to identify any markings despite the bright sun overhead.  They looked like large bombers in shape, but then again, not.  Very hard to describe their shape.  Kind-of like military planes but kind-of not.  They looked more like some sort of squashed plane, with a short nose and squat wings, but very large.  It was very hard to tell. The reason I am posting this is because they were traveling at a speed SLOWER than the birds around me.  Even at the distance from me, I could see the small prop plane moving faster than the five large aircraft. They didn’t make sense.  They should not of have been airborne, moving so incredibly slowly.  It doesn’t make any sense.  Only balloons can travel that slowly, or maybe a hand-glider.  They should have fallen out of the sky. They moved in formation all the way out to the ocean and I lost sight of them.  I don’t understand. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
