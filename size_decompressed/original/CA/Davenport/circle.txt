It dropped slowly in elevation, stopped and then headed to the southwest at a speed that was incredible. It disappeared within a second of accellerating.  It appeared to be huge. It turned orange collered at its most distant visable location. Database coordinator--Anyone else see this?;37.0423;-122.2137
