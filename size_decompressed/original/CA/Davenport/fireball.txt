PD));2010-03-01 21:23:00;1 minute or so;star turned into a bright flare gradually changed and suddenly lost the light I was driving alone from my mothers house in Half Moon Bay to my house in Santa Cruz.  About 45 mins in between the two cities with nothing in between, and the sky was clear and crisp.  About halfway in my drive, I noticed one of the stars started to gradually and became incredibly white bright flare-ish light.  It did not move at all.  I thought someone shot a flare, or a firework, but it didn't move, and the light dispersed after a full minute of bright flare lights to a normal glimmering star.  I pulled over to take a picture of it from my blackberry phone but it went away before I can take the shot, and my phone suddenly went out of power.  I've seen a lot of things in the sky that COULD be explained, but this one I couldn't find a logical explaination.  If you can debunk and find out what I saw, that would help me sleep better at night.  Thanks for the website, keep up the good work. ((NUFORC Note:  Flare from Iridium satellite??
