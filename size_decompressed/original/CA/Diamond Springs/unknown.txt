The objects moved at different speed and then stopped;2012-11-05 21:30:00;30 minutes;I would describe the objects as orange in color and moving across the sky at a slow to moderate speed keeping the same distance apart from the SE to the NE.   Looking at the objects through my binoculars, I could a slight shape that was jagged on the top and rough on the bottom kind of a triangle shape.  The objects moved at different speed and then stopped, as they were stopped the one in the trail position started glowing bright and dim about 5 to 6 times and then dropped what looked to me like a small missile but the light from that faded quickly, I saw that happen 3 times and the trailing object jest faded away and disappeared.   The other object still in one position started doing the same thing, started glowing bright and dim about 5 to 6 times and then dropped what looked to me like a small missile the light from the object it dropped also faded away quickly and the object also started fading until it disappeared.   I was with my wife and neighbor who also witnessed this event;38.6868;-120.8197
