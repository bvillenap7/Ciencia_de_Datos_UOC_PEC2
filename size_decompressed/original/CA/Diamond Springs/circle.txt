Orange balls are everywhere.;2013-10-03 23:00:00;10 minutes;orange balls are everywhere We have seen these orange balls several times over a two month period.  Eleven different nights.  Usuallaaround ten pm.  They always came from the east and went to the north or south.  Never west.  They were silent and below cloud cover.  Some would just vanish and others would go straight up or down until we couldnt see them anymore.  They were orange, round and kind of plasma looking.  A firey look to them.  It's been a year and we havnt seen them.  But now all kinds of reports have been made. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));38.6868;-120.8197
