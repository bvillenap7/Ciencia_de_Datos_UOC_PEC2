UFO and US military play follow me if you can.;1998-10-05 21:30:00;15 MIn;UFO and US military play follow me if you can. A red glowing sphere about 7 ft. in diameter(like the one in Close Enconuters) flew overhead and paused.  I was being chased by a Chanuk 34 Marine  helecopter. It appeared to be playing with the helecopter. It moved suddenly out of the path of the approaching chopper by about 100 ft. and the chopper made a hard right turn to follow the light. it then proceeded north almost out of view, then proceded to follow the I5 freway south out of view.  about 6 minuites later  the sphere and the helecopter proceded north bound up the I5 untill it was out of site.  3days later another event happened which I will relay in another report.  Involving different craft and men in black ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.2616000000003;-118.456900000001
