The objects where flying straight from behind me, straight above and very high up, but seeming lower than other aircraft in the sky. The other aircraft were quite obviously airplanes and helicopters, whereas the fireballs where defiantly not any kind of conventional aircraft.  The 3 objects maintained a loose triangle formation as they flew, the banked to the left and disappeared first 1 then the other 2 quickly after.
