Sitting at my kitchen table, I looked out the window and saw this phenomenal bright, (what at first I thought was a plane coming into SFO, but they don’t land from the East.) It was intensely bright and had several other ‘stars’ around it that kept moving around the area of the large ‘star’. In going through the pictures I took on my cell phone, (through my kitchen window with screen,)  The first pictures, after brighten them, came out looking like an alien. Of the 3 videos I took, only one shows anything - but nothing like I saw. After the ‘alien looking pictures came the other pictures I took through my kitchen and then front room which has no screen. It seems as though once I was filming or taking pictures, a dark cloud would cover them… Really friggen weird, and I have seen UFO’s before - but not in a long time. This all was about 4:30 a.m. June 10, 2017;37.4775;-122.4505
