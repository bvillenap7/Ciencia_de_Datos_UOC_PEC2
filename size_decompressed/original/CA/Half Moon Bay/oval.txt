I was invited by a friend to stay at a beach house about seven miles south of Half Moon Bay, California, early summer 1975. It was my first trip to california from the East Coast and I enjoyed watching the evening sunsets. The coast had been foggy for a couple of nights so on this particular night i sat on the beach with field glasses enjoying the ocean and approaching sunset. As the sun began to set i noticed a bright starlike object hovering near the horizon close to where the sun was setting. I took a look through the field glasses and noticed that the object seemed to be flikering much like a star but the center was dark. The object hovered for a time than suddenly began to ascend very fast. In short time it was out of view. The atmosphere seemed electric. I looked around to see if any one was on the beach with but i was alone. To this day i have no idea what i observed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1975 is approximate.  PD));37.4775;-122.4505

It does seem to reflect sunlight and seems to be metalic. No lights were seen.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a Frisbee.  PD));2017-09-03 13:00:00;1 minute;It does seem to reflect sunlight and seems to be metalic.  No lights were seen. The craft was seen at Half Moon Bay, CA.  The craft is located above and just left of the rock in the ocean.  You must have the ability to zoom in.   In my opinion it is something beyond what you can expect to see in our skies. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report identifies himself as a former member of the military, from which he retired.  We spoke with him via telephone, and he seemed to us to be quite serious-minded.  We suspect he is an excellent witness.  However, our suspicion is that the object captured in the photo, which was not noticed at the time the photo was taken, may be a Frisbee.  PD));37.4775;-122.4505
