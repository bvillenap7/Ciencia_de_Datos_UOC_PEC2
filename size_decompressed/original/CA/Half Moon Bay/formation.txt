Multiple satellite-looking lights travelling in multiple single file formation.   ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-04 07:40:00;10 minutes;Multiple satellite-looking lights travelling in multiple single file formation I saw numerous what looked like satellites moving at satellite speed moving in a straight line from the south west to the north east.  There were first two moving in the same path only a few seconds apart.  Then a little further north were many more some of which appeared to be following the same path and equidistant from each other.  At one point there were at least four of them equidistant following each other visible at the same time.;37.4775;-122.4505
