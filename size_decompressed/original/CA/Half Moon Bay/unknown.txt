Has this happened to anybody else?While renting a town home in Half Moon Bay California I was awakened at least three times from my sleep because my room began to light up a brillant Orange color. I would open my eyes and see that the color was getting brighter. I would sit up and look around and then the brillant orange color would start to dim and then fade out altogether. On two occasions I told myself I must be dreaming and went back to sleep. On the third I actually got up and looked out the window because this time the lightrays coming from outside the window into my room seemed to move from my bedroom ceiling down to the floor as if an object outside the window were rising up and over the building yet I heard no sound. By the time I got to the window and looked outside I saw nothing. Each time the lights peeked (to there brightest) after about four seconds and then began to fade and were totally gone about four seconds later. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
