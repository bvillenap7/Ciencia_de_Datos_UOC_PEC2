Bright light in sky, moving and hovering, took off fast.;2016-07-26 10:00:00;30 minutes;Bright light in sky, moving and hovering, took off fast. At around 10 am, in half Moon Bay, CA, at Ocean View Park, our 6 year old daughter spotted this small bright light in the sky.  It was a sphere and appeared to be very high up, due to its small size.   It was moving left and right quickly, at about one second intervals, back and forth.  Then it stopped moving, and remained stationary for a few minutes.   Then it started moving slowly in a southern direction, paused a few times, continued in a southern direction slowly for several minutes in this manner.   Suddenly, it took off at a rapid pace in the southern direction.   The object was inaudible because it was very high up, too far away to hear any sound.  The light was very bright for the size of the object, appeared to be self illuminated.   This is the second one of these objects we've seen.  Last one was seen less than a month ago, on June 30, 2016.  That event was observed with a telescope.  The object, when focused through the telescope lens, was a definite perfect sphere, silver in color, with definite lights.;37.4775;-122.4505

It hovered for a few minutes while we watched wondering what it was.  We got our iPhone to start recording to see if we could get a closer look then it moved and shot up so far up in the sky by the stars and hovered.  Then shot across the sky over our home.;37.4775;-122.4505
