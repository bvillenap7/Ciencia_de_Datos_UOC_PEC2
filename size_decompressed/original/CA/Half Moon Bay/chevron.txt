70+ chevron-shaped aircraft, approx. 40,000`, flying from northeast to southwest over Half Moon Bay, CA, like someone opened up at box ;1999-11-23 11:15:00;5min.-+;70+ chevron-shaped aircraft, approx. 40,000`, flying from northeast to southwest over Half Moon Bay, CA, like someone opened up at box and they all escaped out of it. No sound. No contrails or chemtrails. All white. Several stalled or stopped, then surged forward at a greater velocity than the others. A commercial jet airliner flew approx. 20,000 ft. beneath them, making usual noise. Asked others on the beach to look at them...they didn't want to be bothered. I pretty well covered it above.;37.4775;-122.4505
