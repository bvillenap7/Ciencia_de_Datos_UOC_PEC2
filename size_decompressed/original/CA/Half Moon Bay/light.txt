I noticed a line of big lights of different colors hovering over the top of the mountains.  ((anonymous report)).;2019-08-18 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;On Sunday, August 18th, I was driving on Hwy 92 at around 9pm, PDT, from Half Moon Bay heading west toward San Mateo, CA.  As I drove through the mountainous part of the highway, where there are no structures, I noticed a line of big lights of different colors hovering over the top of the mountains.   At first I thought it might be a house, but the lights were too big, and at some point I would've passed the house.  Yet, as I kept driving the lights were still hovering over this mountainous peak.   Once I started to make my descent on the road, I could no longer see the peak of the mountain and lost sight of the lights.  I saw them for about 5-10 minutes of driving as I was driving up the road and the peak of the mountains/hills were visible from the highway.
