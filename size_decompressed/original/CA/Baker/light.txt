Ball of light (3' wide) paces car on right side of freeway, then bolts 90 degrees to horizon at unbelievable speed;1988-07-01 13:00:00;3 minutes;Ball of light (3' wide) paces car on right side of freeway, then bolts 90 degrees to horizon at unbelievable speed I did have a UFO encounter myself in broad daylight out driving between San Bernardino and Las Vegas, somewhere on the ways to Baker, CA I would guess around 1988.  I was out there driving all alone when I saw a light over to my right not that far away from my car over the desert landscape.  I thought it was strange and wondered what it was.  I assumed it was a spotlight from some crop duster airplane or something.  But the weird thing was that this light pretty much paced my car and flew along side my car at about 65 MPH for a full minute or so.  I kept wondering what it was, and was trying to keep my eye on the road and also on the light to try to figure out what it was.  After about a minute, the light seemed to have enough of pacing my car, and it bolted 90 degrees away from my car flew incredibly fast over the desert landscape and flew over the horizon in about two or three seconds, way faster than any commercial plane or jet could travel.  Was this a spaceship containing aliens?  It didn’t seem too big to me.  It kind of seemed like a ball of light.  It was hard to guage the size of the craft (if it was a craft), but I would guess the diameter was no more than six feet tall or wide.  It seemed more like a ball o! f light maybe three feet wide to me.  How fast was it going to get from my car to the horizon and over the san on the horizon?  It’s ahrd to say, but it was fast enough for me to say, “Whoa!”.  At the time, I thought that the light was probably part of some military aircraft experiments the US Army was doing tests on in the desert.  But  if it weren’t a military vehicle, it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that this might have been an alien spacecraft.  As far as I know, nothing on earth could travel that fast.  Also, there was no engine sound, no sonic boom, just silence.  Pretty cool, huh?  It definitely shook me up. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Fireball in Desert near Baker, Ca.;2004-12-25 06:20:00;30-45 seconds;Fireball in Desert near Baker, Ca. About 30 miles north of Baker I looked out my right window (looking west) at what I thought was the rising sun... but soon realized it was the wrong direction.  It had the glare of the sun, it was initially in the shape of a sun 2/3 exposed above the horizon.  However, the truncated flat bottom was above the horizon.  The object changed shape to something resembling a bowler hat, the a disk with a dome, and then quickly went to a small point of light (one hundredth the size) and disappeared.  It was definitely some way in the distance, 15-20 miles is a guess.  The only thing I could compare it to (after a distant sun), was the type of flame emmitted from an oil refinery.;35.3606;-116.0638
A light, traveling very quickly, passed us on a highway and dissapeared.;2009-04-24 23:00:00;2-3 Seconds;A light, traveling very quickly, passed us on a highway and dissapeared. On our way to Las Vegas, on a highway we were traveling on, a mysterious light appeared out of nowhere and quickly moved 50-60 feet across the highway.  This object seemed to be a shooting star at first.  It had the same characteristics and the same movement, only it had no tail to it and it appeared out of nowhere and vanished after it quickly moved accross the highway.;35.3606;-116.0638
@4:15am green light beam near Baker, Ca;2019-04-08 04:15:00;2-3 seconds;@4:15am green light beam near Baker, Ca @4:15am Just North of Baker, CA, on Death Valley Rd/127 there was a green flash of light to the west (maybe near fort irwin? or closer to the mtn range).   First a bright flash caught my eye, then as i look over i see the beam & another (light?) with a cylinder shaped green aura around it which appeared to be slowing down as it got closer to the ground, but it all happened fast.  Data recieving?  The cylinder shape light that appeared to be traveling down the beam is what threw me off.;35.3606;-116.0638
