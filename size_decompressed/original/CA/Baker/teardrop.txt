While driving late night (2 AM) with daughter, toward Las Vegas on I-5 about 30 miles East of Baker Ca., saw one glowing green object on left side of car, then about 1 minute later another on right side of freeway, close enough to see hit the desert floor but object dropped behind a hill just at the last second.  Thought about space junk burning up, but was surprised by the odd colors. Also thought about some type of military ordnance but though No because of proximity to freeway (too dangerous)!  Didn't think about it again until I heard Art Bell's show last week and realized that I saw those Green objects too!;35.3606;-116.0638
