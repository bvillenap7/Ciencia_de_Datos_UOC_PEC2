The object stayed in the air for about 45 seconds, it got bright and then dimmed a little, then it got as bright as the sun and dimmed again but this time in got smaller and smaller until it vanished.  this also happened again around Edwards air force base, but this time all of us noticed about five to ten jet fighters were flying around, the fighter were crisscrossing the sky like they were looking or chasing something. Soon we got in to the mountains and it was over cast so we lost sight of the fighter jets. There was a lot of traffic on high way way 58 so I know other people had to see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by student.  It would be a very unusual circumstance, we believe, that 5-10 USAF jets would be scrambled, in response to a bona fide sighting of a genuine UFO.  Just a guess, however.  PD));35.3606;-116.0638
