orange rectangle runs across ground, turns into sphere and back again;2008-12-15 01:00:00;10 seconds;orange rectangle runs across ground, turns into sphere and back again I was driving down the 15 North at 80 miles an hour on the way home to Los Angeles at approximately 1am.  I was approximately 20-30 miles outside of Baker, CA when a saw a bright flash of sun burnt orange to my left. At the base of the mountain range to my left was a single orange rectangular object.  From my vantage point in my car the object was about a thumb length high and two thumb lengths long.  It moved along the ground at an incredible speed, and in a straight line leaving a slight trail of orange light, when it suddenly paused and turned into a sphere.  Only the mountain range and ground were in my field of vision, with no obstructions. Still orange it then took off again as a rectangular object (as previously described), and then vanished.   The event happened in about 10 seconds.;35.3606;-116.0638
