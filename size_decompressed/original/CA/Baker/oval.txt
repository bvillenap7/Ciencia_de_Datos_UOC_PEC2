HE WOKE ME AND SHOUTED OUT LOOK AT THAT. I OBSERVED AN OVAL OBJECT THAT WAS GLOWING A FLOURESCENT GREEN. IT WAS TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED HEADING NORTH THEN IT SUDDENLY DIPPED DOWNWARDS AND INCREASED ITS SPEED AT LEAST 5 TIMES AND SHOT OUT OF THERE LEAVING A GREEN FLOURESCENT TAIL THEN IT SIMPLY VANISHED INTO THIN AIR.  WE CONTINUED TO WATCH THE SKIES BUT SAW NO OTHER OBJECTS. THERE WAS ALOT OF TRAFFIC HEADING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS OF INTERSTATE 15 I CANT BELIEVE THAT THERE WASNT QUITE A FEW CARS THAT COULD ALSO HAVE WITTNESSED THIS.  COULD YOU PLEASE CONTACT ME AND LET ME KNOW IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER SIGHTINGS OF THIS OCCURANCE.  THANK YOU FOR ANY INFO YOU CAN PROVIDE.;35.3606;-116.0638
