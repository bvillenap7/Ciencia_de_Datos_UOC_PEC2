giant triangle spotted of I-15 N to vegas between barstow and baker, Ca, june 24th at 11pm.;2005-06-24 23:00:00;5 minutes;giant triangle spotted of I-15 N to vegas between barstow and baker, Ca, june 24th at 11pm. We were driving North on Interstate 15 from Los Angeles, CA on June 24th, 2005.  About 40 Miles from Baker, CA after passing Barstow, CA, we (my passenger and I) noticed a Bright white star off to the northwest, just off the side of the highway.  As we continued North on the HWY, we noticed 2 smaller lights to the sides slightly lower than the bright center light.  They appeared to be of equal distance and angle from the center light.  As we approached, it increased in width.  It was 11PM so the only lights were the travelling cars and the stars, it was a clear night, it seemed we were getting closer to the object, triangle.  As we got closer, we noticed that the stars vanished behind the object, the black object.  We continued past the object and never saw it again.  It seemed as if it were not moving at all or so slow it was unmeasurable.;35.3606;-116.0638
