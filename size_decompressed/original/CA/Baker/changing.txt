A watery ripple in the sky like a ribbon flapping in the wind, then forming the shape of a craft (see below);1998-10-16 16:30:00;5 to 8 seconds;A watery ripple in the sky like a ribbon flapping in the wind, then forming the shape of a craft (see below) Driving to Las Vegas, between Baker CA and the Nevada State Line while still in the mountains to the right of a peak I saw a black flash, thinking there was a big piece of cloth blowing through the sky, Then I looked straight at it as it crossed the road only a few hundred feet above ground but seemed to just appear out of nowhere. The shape was fluctuating until after it crossed the road Then it appeared to have the shape of a Bird Of Prey (the Klingon warships fromStar Trek) is the only way I could describe it. then I realized it was being flanked by a regular jet airplane, military in nature, following to the right and just behind the object. They both disappered over the mountainous horizon. Both were traveling VEry fast, there was no sound at all and there were other cars on the road, I couldn't have been the only one who saw it, It was HUGE! So huge it dwarfed the little fight jet that was accompying it.;35.3606;-116.0638
