Bright, glowing orange orb that followed us on our hiking trip and back home.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus??  PD));2020-03-18 21:00:00;30 minutes;Bright, glowing orange orb that followed us on our hiking trip and back home. As we were hiking through desert mountains, in the sky above the mountains next to us there was a bright object which at first appeared to be a planet or just a very bright star. We were walking for about 20 minutes and forgot about the bright looking star.  As we turned back and retraced our steps, we saw that the bright light moved across a distance of half a mile.  It seemed like it was moving so all four of us stopped to watch it, and it was essentially floating but not totally still.  It was hovering.  Glowing orange orb.  Almost like a fireball.  Very bright.  The rest of the way back to our original spot, we watched in awe as this orb literally followed us and stopped with us whenever we stopped along the way.  It followed us from the hiking spot, to our car, and we could see it the entire time we drove home miles away.;33.6719;-116.3032
