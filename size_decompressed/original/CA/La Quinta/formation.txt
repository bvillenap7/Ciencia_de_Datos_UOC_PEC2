4 lights in diamond shape formation;2000-01-02 21:35:00;5-10 sec;4 lights in diamond shape formation It was about 23:35 PST I was sitting in my living room and just happened to look out the window and saw 4 lights in diamond shape formation.  They were kinda large to the fact that I would hear something if they were planes or helicopters.  They kinda lingered for a second or two the last light went out of formation and them went back in formation and sped off very fast leaving only a light trail with dissapeared very quickly. I got up and ran outsite and they were gone.;33.6719;-116.3032
Three bright circles of light with centre activity over our heads.15 minutes duration.La Quinta CA;2010-04-02 21:00:00;15 minutes;Three bright circles of light with centre activity over our heads.15 minutes duration.La Quinta CA My wife and I were on vacation in the dessert staying in a rented house. We were in the hot tub at the time of the incident. Looking up at the stars we observed three circular objects of light going round in a circle. After a few minutes these objects came from a great height to around what seemed like 50 or 60 feet above our heads. All the time they appeared to be chasing each other round in a circle.Once they just circled our house one could see inside each ring activity or what I would describe as electrical charges. After a few more minutes one of the circles just broke off and flew upwards at great speed.The same thing then happened to the other two.;33.6719;-116.3032

Same as last night.  Lights, equidistant, moving in a SE direction ((NUFORC Note:  Cluster of Starlink satellites.  PD));2019-11-12 18:00:00;30 seconds;Same as last night.  Lights, equidistant, moving in a SE direction - this time twice as many as we witnessed last night.  Seemingly in an instant, 3/4 of the lights went 'off' - and the cluster of lights continued moving, though was a smaller cluster.  Interesting!  UFO?  Flight testing of something e.g. Amazon, drones?;33.6719;-116.3032
HIGH SPEED BRIGHT WHITE OBJECTS PASSING OVERHEAD;2020-09-01 00:25:00;3-5 seconds;HIGH SPEED BRIGHT WHITE OBJECTS PASSING OVERHEAD Was outside looking up at the full moon and two white lights passed overhead from NW to SE.  Initially thought they were Starlink, one behind the other (if you held your fist overhead apart) as I've seen Starlink before but their speed and brightness caught my attention (brighter than any satellite I've ever seen and the brightest in the sky at the time especially with the full moon and local light pollution).  In my field of view due to trees for only an estimated 3 seconds which would mean they went from horizon to horizon in less than 20 seconds.;33.6719;-116.3032
