I saw a bright light but saw nothing or no one around me;1995-01-15 02:00:00;unknown;I saw a bright light but saw nothing or no one around me In the middle of the night while my husband and I were asleep this event occurred. I dreamed that (my husband and myself) were in my parents driveway slowly being lifted into the air. Next thing I recall is a exetremly bright light or glow over me.I could look into it's direction wihtout hurting my eyes at all. I looked around the area I was in, but saw nothing or no one. I was laying on my back,but felt nothing under me. During this time I had no fear, I felt very relaxed and calm. I woke up after a unknown period of time to saw a bright light shining in my bedroom window from a angle that would be imposible for any type of aircraft to do because of very tall pine trees behind our house. I almost chalked it up to just a weird dream until my husband woke and told me about his dream which was exactly the same as mine. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

Video of ball of light in the sky with saucer shaped haze around it.;2018-04-04 13:00:00;12 seconds;Video of ball of light in the sky with saucer shaped haze around it. Without using word processor.  On this date, I was video taping geese in the sky and after reviewing my video, I have on the video one ball of light that came across the sky and when it left it created a haze around it and then left.  It is not a lens flare, it is not a drone, it is a UFO for sure.  When pausing the video the light has a haze around it similar to a saucer shape.  Someone with special equipment could certainly enlarge this to see exactly what it is.;33.6142;-114.5974
