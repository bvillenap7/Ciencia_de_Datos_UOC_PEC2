3 lights flying in triangle formation traveling east.;2014-02-24 19:00:00;5 minutes;3 lights flying in triangle formation traveling east. I stepped outside to let my dogs out, I first noticed 1 light in the sky to the west and thought it was a helicopter, but as I kept looking in the sky I noticed a second and third light in the form of a triangle moving in sync with each other heading east almost right over my neighborhood block.  I thought maybe a group of helicopters, but I heard no engine noise.   The 3 light triangle formation slowed almost to a stop and rotated clockwise in almost a full circle and started heading east.  The lights very far apart, maybe 1/3rd a mile apart from each other, it did not seem that far from the ground, maybe as high as small planes travel.   I could see the stars through the 3 point triangle formation so I don't think it was a solid object.   My dogs did bark, but they bark at anything.  They were flying pretty slow, too slow to be planes I think, it took about 5-8 minutes from when I noticed them in the west, to when they were out of my view to the east.  Gave me chil! ls when it slowed to almost a stop and started turning clockwise, at that point I knew I was seeing something awesome.  Gave me chills.
