While returning from Calif. on my Harley back to the east coast I stopped to take a picture of the desert and the long widing road. (Interstate 10 somewhere near Blythe)  The picture was taken with a Kodak DX3900 Zoom Digital Camera. I am by trade a Commerical Pilot, I did not notice or see a plane anywhere near me, as a pilot I would have taken notice of an aircraft in front of me at what seems to be low altitude.  When I returned home and showing my pictures to my daughters they noticed the dot in the sky and told me I had cought a UFO in the picture. I passed it off and had forgoten about the picture until a couple of days ago with nothing to do I was going back through all the pictures, when I came upon this one I went to my photo software and keep enlarging it untile it appears not to be a bird or a plane. It looks oval or oblong in the photo.  I have no idea what it is, it could be a spot on the lens, but I checked the photos before and after this one was taken and there's no spot. I do not clean the lens as often as I should, just dont think about it plus theres a cover for the lens that ativates auto. when the camera is cut off.  Will be glad to email this photo to you.;33.6142;-114.5974
