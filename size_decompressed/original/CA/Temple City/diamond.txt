Ten diamond shape objects floating in the sky.;2014-02-23 21:55:00;5 minutes;Ten diamond shape objects floating in the sky. It was ten at night and the sky was dark shade of pink.  We  were on a dark quiet neighborhood.  We were parked on the towards the south side and I seen an object through the trees.  It was brown and a diamond shape.  Floating through the sky side to side.  I thought it could be a bird or a kite but it was too high in the sky.   Then ten more diamond objects floated behind it doing the same thing.   It was heading towards north and disappeared.   The dogs on the neighborhood were barking and no more than five minutes a helicopter came and went in the same direction looking for something.;34.1021;-118.0474
