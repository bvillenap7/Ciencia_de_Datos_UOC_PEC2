maroonish orange sphere possibly fireball, completely still, very low, silent;1999-12-26 22:30:00;not sure;maroonish orange sphere possibly fireball, completely still, very low, silent It was the night of the Eaton Canyon fires. I can't remember exactly the date. My friend and I had just seen the fires heading north on the freeway towards my house. When we got there I got out of the passenger side of his car and shut the door. He started driving off headed west as i looked east. There was this gigantic silent maroon/orange/red ball/sphere/fireball thing just fixed in the sky not moving. It was quite low. I was frozen for a second in thought. I actually thought it to be the moon and some sort of apocalyptic thing, although it was not where the moon was supposed to be. I turned around to alert my friend, but he was pulling away. At that point I felt a great fear and kind of panic. I looked at it for another moment and then went into the house and kind of ignored my family. I regret deeply not staying out to watch it or alerting my family. I was seriously freaked out, though! I sat in my room and did just about anything to divert my attention from what i had just seen. Then at about 1:30 AM, i went outside and the moon was just how and where it should've been, which was northwest in the sky to where this very strange object was. I spent that night and the next two days silent and contemplative of it. Everything i could imagine it to be went through my head.;34.1021;-118.0474
