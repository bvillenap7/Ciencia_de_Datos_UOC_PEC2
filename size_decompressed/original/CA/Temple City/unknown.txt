Increasing in intensity quite bright. not a white light, but more conventional in coloration. after 5 to 8 seconds, the brightness reduced to that typical for a passing satelite moving due north in the sky. Commonly,  satelites are observed, reflecting the sun in the evening sky. this was uniquely uncommon.
