Bright red light.;1999-08-29 20:35:00;15 MINUTES;Bright red light. The object appeared in the northeast sky and slowly moved north. It was approximately the size of the planet Venus (a bit larger perhaps) The light was bright red, if I were to best describe the color, I would say it was a candy apple red.(very bright) The object remained very bright for most of the 15 minutes we viewed it. But it did flicker several times for a very brief period. One of the times it flickered myself and another witness noticed the lights in our backyard dimmed as if the power was about to go out. At the same time, my brother who was in the house, stated the television and cable box had shut off. The object finally disappeared from our view by flickering one last time and slowly faded into the night sky.;34.1021;-118.0474
Red star-like object in the northeast sky.;1999-08-29 20:35:00;15 minutes;Red star-like object in the northeast sky. The object appeared in the northeastern sky it was a bright red light. It was approximately the size of the planet Venus. It was very bright for minutes at a time and then dim itself to a point where it was no longer visable and just as fast as it dimmed it would brighten. I would describe it as a flickering. At the time of one the flickers, myself and another witness observed the the lights in our backyard dim in sequence with the flickering light in the sky. At the same time my brother who was inside the house told us his T.V. and cable box had shut off. The object moved very slowly towards the north. It moved so slow we hadn't realized it had moved until we all were looking at the object at a different point in the sky. The object finally disappeared from our site after about 15 minutes. It began to dim again and slowly faded from view.;34.1021;-118.0474

((NUFORC Note:  The report sounds reminiscent of the flash that can be caused by an Iridium satellite.  Our thanks to Lexy for having researched the issue, and reported her findings back to NUFORC.  She has discovered that this report possibly is consistent with an Iridium satellite.  Her message to NUFORC is shown below.
