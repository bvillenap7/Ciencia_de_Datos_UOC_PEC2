On Wednesday evening, I decided to water my lawn in the backyard.  I sat down in my chair, which faces East, as my two labs were tracking the stream of water from the water hose in  right to left direction.  I glaze up into the heavens and directly to my left, North East direction, I noticed two bright stars, at the moment that is what I thought I was witnessing.  Distances is hard to estimate, but if I were to guess, I would have use my thumb to equate about an inch of separation between each.  Immediately I thought, Damn it reminds me of Orion's belt stars, except one is missing. As I reached for my cell phone to record what I was witnessing, the two objects began to disappear like the Phoenix Lights incident.   I was shocked and called my brother to describe my experience. It's now two in the morning and I am heading outside again with quality and strong binoculars made by Steiner. Thank for this opportunity, something I will cherish and has made me more vigilant.;34.1021;-118.0474
2 reddish yellow pulsating slow moving lights hovering over Los Angeles;2020-12-26 02:10:00;5 minutes;2 reddish yellow pulsating slow moving lights hovering over Los Angeles Two reddish orange glowing lights hovered approx 200-300 hundred feet apart from each other. I was facing north on Temple City Blvd north of Las Tunas Drive, Temple City when I saw this. They floated about a third ways above the horizon. These lights slowly moved west, the one to my right moved a little faster than the one to my left. The one to my right faded away before the one to my left. It was like the one on my left was floating over El Monte and the other over Rosemead, Ca. Round slow pulsating lights, yellow centers red outer solid lights. Each color pulsates separately. Equal in and size. Like street light sized but high in the sky. I was driving when I saw this and at 1st I thought it was a meteor but they didnâ€™t move quickly or fade and streak like a meteor does. Thank you MH Temple City Ca;34.1021;-118.0474
