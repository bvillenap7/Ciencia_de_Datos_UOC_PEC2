Around midnight, 1978 I was at a dinner party talking about a recent trip through Nevada and the infamous area 51 when one of the guests mentioned an experience 20 years ago that changed her life. She lived in Hoopa, a sort of Indian resevation in northern California right near the Trinity River. At around midnight she looked out her bedroom window and saw tinkling lights in the shape of an oval just hovering near the western ridge of the valley. At first she thought it was some type of helicopter but she didn't hear the pounding sound that usually accompanies one. All her other family was asleep so one else witnessed the event. She layed in her bed and watched the craft just hover for 45 minutes but then she fell asleep.;41.0504;-123.6742
