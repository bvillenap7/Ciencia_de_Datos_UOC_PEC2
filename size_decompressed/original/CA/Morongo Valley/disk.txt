Hovering disk ascending.;2009-05-25 13:30:00;10 mins;Hovering disk ascending. I was sitting on the roof just thinking about what to do after college.  Suddenly all the wind stopped and I heard a loud humming noise.  It was a humming that sounded like it was in my head but I dont think it was.  Then I saw some disk off in the distance rising vertically.  It was the strangest thing. It looked like it was about 5 miles in front of me and about 2 miles high in the air when it stopped lifting higher.  It just stayed there for about a minute, then it races another mile or so higher.  It lingered there for about 3 minutes.  After that, it just kept ascending high and higher untill I couldn't see it anymore.;34.0639;-116.5665
