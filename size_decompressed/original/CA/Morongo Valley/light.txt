Blueish/White light seen in Morongo Valley, CA.;2008-11-16 23:35:00;10 minutes;Blueish/White light seen in Morongo Valley, CA. While driving on route 62, heading towards the 10 freeway entrance, a white light with a blueish tint suddenly appeared in front of my vehicle. The object was 300ft above the road, about the size of a railroad boxcar, round and perhaps 1/4 mile ahead of me. It made no noise, but seemed to be moving in the same direction, following the road. I would guess it's speed was roughly the same as mine(65mph) because it remained at the same distance from my vehicle as I was moving. I observed it for 5 seconds, then it simply vanished. About 5 minutes later, further down the road, it appeared again, over the freeway, same height. This sighting lasted roughly 10 minutes, and it vanished again. As I entered the merging lane to the freeway, it appeared again, this time on the opposite side of the freeway. I wasn't able to keep my eyes on it and merge, so how ong it remained visible I couldn't say, but I saw it for at least 3 seconds.;34.0639;-116.5665
Fast flying Object;2008-11-17 18:42:00;4 secs;Fast flying Object At 6:42 P.M. I was on my back porch, which faces eastward.  I saw an object (1) approaching from the northeast to the southwest, at an incredible rate of speed.   There was was a bright white light, but then the light went out.  I could faintly see a shadow in the night sky as it moved southwest.  I could only estimate the elevation at 2000 - 3000 feet.  Shape and color of craft could not be seen.  There were no other observers but me.  This all happened in approximatly 6 seconds.  No sound was heard.;34.0639;-116.5665
