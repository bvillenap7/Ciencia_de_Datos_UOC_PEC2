On the eigth of May, I witnessed a black triangular craft fly over our house three times in the course of about a half an hour.  My father saw it first, and called me outside.  After waiting for a couple of minutes, it showed up again, cruising slowly and silently, directly over the house.  The object was about five hundred feet up, and I could see the structure that the lights were attached to.  There were lights along the two leading edges, and the back was slightly inverted.  I would estimate that the object was about one hundred yards across.  After we lost sight of it, we waited, and it returned within five minutes, this time headed in the opposite direction, as if it had made a turn, and come directly over us once again.  We waited for it show up again, and about ten minutes later we saw it make a turn towards Foothill (Mountains).  We were out there four nights in a row, and it is almost guaranteed to show up.  It usually flys over from about 9:45 to about 10:30 P.M.  We both get the impression that the craft (or whoever may be piloting it) knows when we spot it.  Due to the way it flys directly over the house, it seems to want to make contact of some sort.  Last year around this time of year, the same thing was happening.  It gives me and my father a very eery feeling everytime it flies over.  My father works for the county of Santa Barbara, and I'm a junior at Carpinteria High School, 16 years old.  I myself have never seen any unusual objects in the sky before, such as this.  I also did not really believe in the UFO phenomenon until I saw this.  Needless to say, it is kind of spooky.  We'll keep you updated if anything else happens.;34.4058780487805;-119.518204878049
