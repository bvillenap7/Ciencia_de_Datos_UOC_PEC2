The reason I am writing to you is that I have never heard of the type of sighting that I had.   I was in the back yard with a friend watching the stars when I saw something out of my peripheral vision.  I turned to see a rose colored rectangle shaped fog or cloud comming towards us.  We stood completely still.  There was no sound, it stopped right above our heads and stayed there for 20 seconds or so.  The object was not visible to us, just a fog, the only thing I can relate to would be what Star Trek called cloaking.   The fog object was rectangle in shape, rose pink in color.   We watched it as it went over the ocean towards the Channel Islands which are about 20 miles from my home.  The craft flew over the ocean toward the islands and disappeared within 10 seconds. Have you ever heard of a sighting like this?   I have listened to Art Bell since he hosted Dreamland and never heard any discription of a sighting like mine.  I know when the object was above us that they saw us and were observing us.  I don't know how far above our heads it was, but if I took a guess it would be 75 to 100 feet.   I am sorry I didn't report it before. I only reported it now because the sighting was so out of the ordinary.  Thankyou Mr Davenport for all you reporting on Coast.  If I see anything again I will write to you pronto. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.4058780487805;-119.518204878049
Highly luminos object seen in Santa Barbara area with very high acceleration capability.;2007-12-08 20:00:00;three - five minutes;Highly luminos object seen in Santa Barbara area with very high acceleration capability. Highly luminous object seen moving in an E x NE - W x SW flight track, speed unknown, altitude FL600 minimum.  Object had a VERY long reddish-orange glowing contrail(re-entry trail?) that from ground level I would estimate was in the neighborhood of two(2) kilometers maximum length.  Object lost glowing trail after a short time but luminosity did not wane.  At first object was thought to be a meteor re-entry but upon continued observation a 'very' faint blinking light could be seen (navigation light?). Object continued course track for a short time and then quickly changed direction to a NW flight track.  Object emitted what I can only describe as a 'pearl colored, luminous, nebulous, atmospheric phenomenon' of a rough diamond shape with a small glowing white center(It reminded me of a mach shockwave that can be seen when supersonic jets approach the sound barrier).  Object then abruptly accelerated at a VERY high rate of speed on NW flight track over the Pacific Ocean.  I can only speculate the rate of acceleration, but would estimate in neighborhood of mach20+.  Atmospheric phenomenon was observed to linger and hold its shape for approximately 20 seconds before slowly dissipating. Event occurred in the following area:  34째30'15.38N 119째29'52.86W x 34째17'38.56N 119째59'41.32W;34.4058780487805;-119.518204878049
