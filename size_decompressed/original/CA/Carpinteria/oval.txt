While driving home at night I saw 2 bright orange oval lights coming down the coastline.  I was on Hwy 101, which is right along the beach.  At first I thought they were helicopters, but then they were too big, and they had blinking lights around them.  I pulled over to get a better look, but by the time I got out of the car, only one light was left.  Then that light faded and disappeared.  I stood longer and the other light rose up from the horizon and stood still.  That that light slowly disappeared.  Did they go up to space or just fade out?   That is the first time I saw something like this.  Is this a weather phenomenon, or a military thing (Vandenburg AFB is north of here and Pt. Magu Naval Base is just south of here).  If alien, then why do they just disappear and what are they probing?;34.4058780487805;-119.518204878049
