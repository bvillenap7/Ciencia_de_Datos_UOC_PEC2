My perspective was that the object was white, round with an orange aura flying  at approximately a 75 degree angle from the horizon.  The object rotated a few times then moved slowly from northwest to south east. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere.  The witness reported that the object seemed to her to perform several maneuvers in the sky.  It was located above the local clouds, she reported.  We have invited the daughter to submit a report, as well.  PD));33.7091;-116.3336
