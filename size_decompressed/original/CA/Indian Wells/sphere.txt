We were having dinner on the porch talking about how beautiful the sky looked with all the stars.  When suddenly we observed a amber ball of light moving across the sky slowly at a constant speed.  It was the same orange color as the old orange monochrome computer screens from the 90's.  It was coming from the Northeast and heading South.   When it started moving south it slowed down as one plane flew past it. It looked like the the amber object was going to hit the approaching plane.  Then it changed direction slightly going southeast.  As we saw it traveling Southeast it faded out and then got brighter again.  After it brightened it dimmed out immediately and vanished from the sky in about 1.5 seconds.  No sound came from this orange light in the sky.  It did move across the sky about the same speed as an airplane when we first saw it.  If i held my arm out with my thumb extended, my thumb would cover the object.  The orange object did not flicker and was constant! during the motion.  It can be described as glowing versus flickering or twinkling.   We have no idea what we witnessed but it was something we never seen before.  From this observation it was a clear night with no wind whatsoever.  We tried to rule it out as a plane but it did not have any flashing lights and did not have any sound.  It could have been a Chinese lantern however it seemed like it was moving too fast and the change in direction caught us by surprise.  I wanted to capture this on my cell phone but it was too dark to record video.  I also had serious doubts that it was a UFO until it disappeared and the fact it changed directions.  I can't figure out what we observed, but it all got our attention.;33.7091;-116.3336
