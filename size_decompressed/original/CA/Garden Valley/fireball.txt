Witnessed bright green fireball object moving over a hilltop while driving.;2001-10-15 21:00:00;2 seconds;Witnessed bright green fireball object moving over a hilltop while driving. My wife and myself were driving home from visiting her parents who live in Garden Valley, a small town between Auburn and Placerville on Highway 193.  The terrain is fairly rugged and hilly, and being around 9:00pm, it was quite dark.  We might not have noticed the object otherwise.  All I can say is we both witnessed a fireball shaped object.  The encounter could be described the exact way one might witness a shooting star.  It streaked briefly over a hilltop to our left and dissapeared.  Now I would love to assume it was just that, a shooting star.  The two reasons I cannot are the color and the size of the object.  The color of the streaking object was bright green, like some sort of flare.  I would like to assume it was a flare, but again I cannot.  Flares do not streak low across the sky with such speed.  (I have considered the possibility of a firework, though we heard no sound whatsoever, no pop or similar explosive sound)  Secondly, it was large, low to the ground, and I could almost be sure that the green light was reflecting off of the hill it passed over.  I immediately turned to my wife to ask he if she had seen it, and she confirmed she had.  Neither of us can explain it, and I just happened to come upon your website and remebered the odd experience.  We haven't spoken of it since.  I just wanted to share, I do not wish to be contacted.
