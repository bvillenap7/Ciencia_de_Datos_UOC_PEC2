The sky was dark, clear and full of stars and satellites.  A large craft with bright white fast flashing lights, then blinking bright red, then green lights, making no noise was flying from the west to the north.  As the craft flashed the bright white lights another set of white flashing lights flashed quickly a short distance right behind the craft.  As if it was one giant craft or a second craft but only the lights could be seen not a craft itself the lights behind the craft were not as bright or as many and did not flash in a normal pattern of flash.  As the craft or crafts got closer North the lights on the front craft stopped flashing and then the second craftâ€™s lights lit up and flashed looking like the first craft did.  The first craft lights then reappeared and two sets of flashing lighted identical crafts could be distinguished.  At this point in the sky the crafts were spaced farther apart then when originally seen.  Then the first craft stayed on! a course to the North, went to a higher altitude in the sky, got a distance away, then seemed to stop in the sky looking like a blinking satellite in the sky.  The second craft turned more to the west at a sharp angle and a lower altitude.  At the same time a third craft appeared from the direction the second craft was going seemingly from out of nowhere.  The third craft had the same white, red and green flashing lights it crossed the flight line of the first two crafts and headed to the east, climbed to an even higher altitude in the sky than the first craft.  The third craft then makes a turn to the south and disappears.;38.8703;-120.8553
