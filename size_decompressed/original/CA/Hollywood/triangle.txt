Since I was driving I was only able to see it as a very white bright light, I thought at first that it had been a shooting Comet or Meteorite Because it was so big! and it was definitely very close to the City and what  seemed above the buildings. At that moment what went through my mind was Oh my God that meteorite/comet is going to hit some buildings it was really so close that I said it will hit something how could it not! My Mom(whom does not believe in Ovnis,aliens or anything of that nature) on the other hand was able to capture more than I did since she was the passenger she states here what she saw At first I thought it was a Blimp with pretty colors of Blue,Green and Yellow then I noticed that this unusual object was triangular in shape like a Kite then it just suddenly disappeared into the sky as a shooting star or comet does with the exeption that this object went upwards and that shooting stars and or Meteorites/Comets shoot downwards and are faint,distant and normal. ((SECOND REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS)) On August,28,2003 at approximately 11:30 pm As I Was Driving On The 101 Fwy North With My Mom On The Passenger Side, We Suddenly Both Spontaneously Saw A Very Bright White Ball ,Which I Thought Had Been a Shooting Meteorite.Since I Was The One Driving I Was Only Able To See It As A Very Bright White Ball. My Mom On The Other Hand Was Able To See and Capture More Than I Could And This Is From A Woman That Does Not Beleive In UFO's or Exraterrestrials , She Describes To Me That She Saw An Object That Was Of Triangular Shape With Several Colors She Said The Shape Reminded Her Of A Kite This Object Then Suddenly Disappeared.The Thing That Makes This Unusual To Me Is That I Have Seen Shooting Stars or Meteorites (which are very faint far and normal)This One Was Very Close To The City.
