Shimmering daylight orb casually traveled in a north-west direction near the Hollywood Bowl in December 2000;2000-12-07 10:50:00;20-minutes;Shimmering daylight orb casually traveled in a north-west direction near the Hollywood Bowl in December 2000 While looking out of a 3rd-floor window (near the Capitol Records-building), me and my co-worker saw a strange, daylight orb moving slowly in a North-Westernly direction near the hills around the Hollywood Bowl (where Highland Avenue meets the 101 Freeway) it probably was traveling at 3rd-floor height. From a mile away, it looked to be about a size somewhere between a large seagull and the front-end of a compact-car. It had an amazing brilliance--shimmering like a white diamond that was being spun in all directions (though it had a distinct round-shape, as an outer-shell, that was almost transparent).  It moved slowly and steadily but occasionally seemed to down-shift (veering slightly off it's otherwise straight-trajectory as if studying the surrounding area).  It seemed to be intelligently guided (with spinning internal-parts) and did not resemble those metallic party-balloons (that occasionally float around Hollywood).  I've seen this thing before, in the same general-area, since around 1998:  Sometimes it was high-up near the clouds too (and appeared drab-gray in color before the sun came up).;34.0866;-118.34035
4 people saw 5 objects in the late afternoon forming a distinctive hovering pattern 20 to 30 thousand feet above Hollywood, CA.;2002-08-04 18:30:00;15minutes;4 people saw 5 objects in the late afternoon forming a distinctive hovering pattern 20 to 30 thousand feet above Hollywood, CA. We saw a total of five objects in the cloudless blue sky, all exactly the same shape and color. I first noticed what I thought was the first star or planet in the late afternoon sky about 50 degrees above horizon. I then moved my eyes around the sky and noticed a second object to the right of the first only a few degrees higher. At this point I called over an acquaintance to verify what I was witnessing. She confirmed the two objects. I then looked around 20 degrees above these two objects and saw 3 more of the same type forming a triangular formation. At this point more people from the party I was attending observed all 5 objects for at least 7 or 8 minutes. They looked like period sized white dots appearing to be about 20 to 40 thousand feet above us. They all maintained a stationary position for the duration of the event. For a few moments both I and the first person to corroborate what I was seeing saw what appeared to be movement from all the objects as they continued to maintain their original stationary position, like a group of helicopters hovering above highway traffic. It appeared as if they had some sort of black second hand that extended out just partially beyond the white spherical body and move quickly back and forth from a zero to 10 second position, imagine each object to be the center of a clock and the moving part was a second hand quickly moving from zero to 10 back to zero repeating this pattern again and again for a few moments. I walked inside to check the internet a came back out 4 or 5 minutes latter to discover they had all disappeared. o o o o o Aproximate shape ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and found him to be an exceptionally good witness.
