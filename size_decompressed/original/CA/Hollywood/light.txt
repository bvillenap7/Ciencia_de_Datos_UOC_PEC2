Bright, bi-colored, stationary lights above clouds.  Hundreds of witnesses.;2000-02-24 23:00:00;15 minutes;Bright, bi-colored, stationary lights above clouds.  Hundreds of witnesses. Bright lights ABOVE CLOUDS in sky above the House of Blues on Sunset Blvd after concert.  Hundreds of other witnesses.  Lights were bright and being slightly diffused by clouds.  Would grow dimmer as clouds moved, (i.e. NOT projected from below).  Weather cool and overcast w/rain earlier that day.  Heard no sound. Stationary lights in approximately the following formation:  .. :  . .  Spanning roughly five degrees in sky (I measured one fist width at arms length), almost directly overhead, outer lights white, center two lights orange, roughly parallel w/Sunset Blvd.  People were coming out and staring up overhead.  Some even called friends on cellular phones asking them to go outside to look.  Absolutely no movement, and we walked approximately a block to our car and the lights remained directly overhead, (so they must have been at very high altitude).  Clouds gradually obscured until invisible.  We drove quickly home, as it was my intent to photograph them from my home, (though they were invisible by then). I am an amateur astronomer and I can assure all that this was NOT any standard celestial phenomenon, (not stars, planets, etc.).  These lights were several orders of magnitude brighter than any night sky objects, (except the moon).  I have never seen or reported anything like this before.  We were surprised to see nothing on the news in the following days.;34.0866;-118.34035

However, we have elected to include the report here, given what was reported from Oswego, NY, for August 24, 2003.  PD));34.0866;-118.34035
Three UFOs seen close to Universal Studios.;2009-03-02 20:00:00;1 Minute;Three UFOs seen close to Universal Studios. My father and I were driving back from Hollywood, going North on Cahuenga.  I look up to see a floating light.  I also see two other lights, the exact same size, close to the first.   I turn my father's attention to the lights.  He had never seen a UFO before, and now he believes.  After staring at it for about a minute, they were gone, just like that.;34.0866;-118.34035
Bright neon green light, lit the whole cloudy north sky for a second.;2011-09-16 22:45:00;4 sec;Bright neon green light, lit the whole cloudy north sky for a second. I just saw the whole north sky light up a neon green for a second.  I was in the CVS parking lot on yucca.  I told the door guy at the bar across the street if he saw anything.  He said no, but he would ask if anyone else saw it. 30 mins later he called me, introduced me to a man, who also saw it driving on the 101 freeway at melrose. (thats about 2 miles away)  The man said he saw it twice, it lit up, and then came back. It lit up the clouds like it was something in the clouds reflecting light, and was not the hollywood bowl, much to bright to be a firework, or L.E.D. billboard.;34.0866;-118.34035

Flashing light of white, red, green and blue in sky. Moved slowly but not with the stars.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star?  PD));2014-10-07 03:32:00;30 minutes;My brother and I were sitting on our balcony when we noticed a flashing light of white, red, green and blue in sky.  Moved slowly but not with the stars. larger than any star in the sky at that moment.  We scrambled to grab our camera because we wanted to document it and have proof so we don't sound crazy to our friends.   We recorded video of it with a tripod and indeed it was moving.  We saved the footage.  We don't know where to share it. It's very weird.  We are unsure of what it but answers would be appreciated. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star?  PD));34.0866;-118.34035
Light flies in circle over Hollywood Hills;2019-11-09 19:32:00;5 minutes;Light flies in circle over Hollywood Hills I was a security guard stationed at the Hollywood Bowl Scenic Overlook last night.  While on my break I laid down on a bench to look at the stars and directly above me I observed what at first glance appeared to be a satellite, an amber light about the size of a star that was moving at a constant speed across the sky.  Then the light began to change direction. I observed it for several minutes and it changed course several times and accelerated and decelerated repeatedly.  On two occasions it stopped and started again.  During this time it lazily flew in circles and various other patterns over the area.  About three minutes in it changed color from amber to blue and then it left flying in a northeasterly direction at about 19:37 hours.;34.0866;-118.34035
