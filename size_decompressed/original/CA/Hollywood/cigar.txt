early-morning cigar-shaped UFO hovered behind trees in Hollywood near Harold Way/101 Freeway in March '95;1995-03-30 05:30:00;5 minutes;early-morning cigar-shaped UFO hovered behind trees in Hollywood near Harold Way/101 Freeway in March '95 I was headed south on Bronson Avenue going towards Sunset Boulevard and noticed a black, cigar-shaped object hovering behind some trees, to my left, where the darkened Harold Way dead-ends at the 101 Freeway. It was the size of a helicopter but made no sound and had no lights it seemed to be bobbing or wobbling slightly, though that could've been the movement of the tree branches.  I made a quick U-turn in order to drive close to it but it was gone by the time I went down the road towards the trees. I routinely never noticed the sky in that area but it was unusually pinkish in color that morning, causing me to immediately notice the UFO's silhouette.  I was excited after the event when I'm normally very groggy while going to work in the early-morning. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD));34.0866;-118.34035
