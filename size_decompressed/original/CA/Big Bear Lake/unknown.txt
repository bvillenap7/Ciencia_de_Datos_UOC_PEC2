2 Bright Speeding Lights over Big Bear Lake;2020-06-29 22:00:00;1 seconds;2 Bright Speeding Lights over Big Bear Lake I saw 2 very bright lights, about 10 minutes apart that traveled in the same direction at super speed, like 1,000 mph. I only saw it for a couple of seconds.  They appeared to be so close, like maybe a 200 yards up from the ground and definitrly in our atmosphere.  I've seen shooting stars before and these didn't look like them.  They were very bright, appeared large, flying over the Big Bear Lake.  I wish I captured a video.;34.235;-116.9053
