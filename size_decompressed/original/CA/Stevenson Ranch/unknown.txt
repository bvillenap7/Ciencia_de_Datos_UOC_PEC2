Bright white pulsing light travels across sky and then shoots straight up.;2017-04-21 21:00:00;30 minutes;Bright white pulsing light travels across sky and then shoots straight up. We saw a white light with red and blue highlights pulsate from bright to dim to bright to dim, the fly across the sky to left, come to stop, shoot straight up, then stop.   It then got brighter again, travelled across the sky from left to right in approximately 20 to 30 seconds, during which time the white light was pulsating from left to right and it got larger as it travelled across the sky.   Then abruptly it stopped again, pulsed bright white and then shot straight up in the sky until it was nothing but a dim point of light.   During the whole event, we saw airplanes going by and it did not resemble an airplane, nor did the lights function in the same way.;34.381;-118.6164
