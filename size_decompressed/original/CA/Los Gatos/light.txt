The below article I found on the web states states it is BLUE. To me all I saw was white light. And it was NOT a meteor or a space rock. It was Gigantic. It was so huge, it would be like looking at the size of a plane taking off and going right over your house. It came from the outer atmosphere into own atmosphere. It was in our own sky. As the report states, it was seen all the way from the South Bay of San Francisco Bay all the way to Sacramento.  http://www.nbc11.com/news/2655056/detail.html   Scientists Speculate About Bright Blue Flash In Sky Astronomers Say It Was Space Rock  POSTED: 7:51 AM PST November 21, 2003 UPDATED: 8:57 AM PST November 21, 2003  NBC11 was flooded with calls from Bay Area drivers who a saw bright blue flash in the sky Thursday night.  So far, scientists don't now for sure what happened.  Astronomers do not think the flash was caused by recent sun flares, or last week's Leonid meteor shower.  Whatever it was, they don't believe it caused any damage.  Astronomer Brian Day said, Most meteors burn completely in the atmosphere. This was big enough where something might have come down, but if it did, it was out over the Pacific Ocean.  Astronomers say it was likely a space rock that put on quite a light show when it burned up on its way through Earth's atmosphere.  It was seen as far away as Sacramento.;37.2150483870967;-121.97301827957
Single Gigantic-size Solid White Light in Rounded Cone Shape with a light tail behind it traveling at Extremely Fast speed;2003-11-20 17:30:00;3 seconds;Single Gigantic-size Solid White Light in Rounded Cone Shape with a light tail behind it traveling at Extremely Fast speed I was driving South on Highway 17 towards Santa Cruz right past H-85 in Los Gatos. Suddenly a VERY large light the shape of a cylinder, dropped straight down out of the sky traveling at a speed I have never comprehended. It was solid white light. It appeared to be in our outer atmosphere. But it was so large seeing it out in space, it had to be absolutely enormous. It just dropped out of space straight down toward earth. It had white light trailing behind it similar to a comet. It was so large it size, and just dropped behind Mount Umunhum (mountain that separates Santa Cruz from San Jose). I thought it was going to crash into earth and was expecting to feel and see some impact. I thought I would feel the earth shake when it hit the earth. But nothing happened. I couldn't believe what I had seen. I called 911 but it rang for 3 minutes until I finally hung up. The phone lines were obviously jammed. I called a friend and asked if they had seen it. They hadn't. This morning, they said there was a meteror shower last night. This was NO METEOR SHOWER. It was a single large solid light in a rounded cone shape with a light tail behind it traveling at a enormous speed. It had to be the size of a small planet. It was gigantic.;37.2150483870967;-121.97301827957
