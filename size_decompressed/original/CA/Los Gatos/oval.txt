Large elipsoid object (greenish hugh) hovering and slowly moving forward just above the treeline (approx. 150 feet) in Los Gatos foothi;1978-03-01 17:00:00;1 min / approx.;Large elipsoid object (greenish hugh) hovering and slowly moving forward just above the treeline (approx. 150 feet) in Los Gatos foothills. I was eleven years old.  Standing on my driveway in the rustic Los Gatos Foothills with my younger brother (9 at the time) and neighbor (16 at the time).  We were talking... then both of their mouths fell open.  I turned to see what was going on.  A large elipsoidal object (about the size of a 1/4 mile running track oval was hovering toward us (very slowly) just above the sycamore trees (approx. 150 feet).  We all stood in silence and awe for a minute as the object moved almost directly over head. I ran into my house to get a camera.  Here's where it gets weird... .  I asked my mother for a camera (we had two olk kodak's in a drawer) and she forgot where they were (my mother knows exactly where everything is in her house, she's meticulous like that)  I went to the drawer where the cameras were and pulled one out.  My mother stopped me saying she didn't know if it had film in it.  I thought it did and took it and ran through the house to go outside.  (It gets weirder now)  I ran through the television room where my father was watching a rerun of Gilligan's Island (he never watches the show, doesn't like it much, BUT it was MY FAVORITE SHOW)  I had the thought that the object/UFO was now gone and sat down to watch the show (which I had seen many times before).  When the show ended... I saw that I had a camera in my hand and couldn't figure out why.  I thought hard and knew that there was something really important that I was forgetting.  I remembered the UFO and a wave of terror came over me.  I ran outside to see if it was still there. I found my younger brother and neighbor exactly where I had left them.  Only now they had been joined by two other neighborhood kids (I believe 18 and 19 years old at that time).  The UFO was no longer there.  I asked where it went.  They asked where did what go?  I said, The UFO, where did it go?.  They said oh, that, it took off real fast, but that was a while ago (all four of them saw it leave). I find it odd that they shrugged it off as if it was no big deal. A few years later I was with my mother in a local shopping mall.  I went into a bookstore to find her.  The book Communion had just come out and wsa displayed in the store.  I literally was scared for my life when I saw the cover... I was terrified that the alien on the cover was going to kill me.  Now, I'd never seen a picture of a Grey up to that point in my life.  And I had no idea that it was an alien.  Non-the-less, I ran out of the bookstore and sat outside for 1/2 an hour scared to go back in and see the image of the alien. Was I abducted?  I don't know. All I know is I saw that UFO (or at least something without wings or propellers)  when I was a kid.  And I was terrified of the picture on a book cover.;37.2150483870967;-121.97301827957
I saw a large, dark, slow, loud, UFO that was 60 ft from the ground.;2010-05-23 02:00:00;5 minutes;I saw a large, dark, slow, loud, UFO that was 60 ft from the ground. At 2:00 AM, i hear this powerful and loud tornado like sound and i rush outside my backyard to see what it is. I see this large, slow moving UFO that has balls of lights at each end of the UFO(N,S,E,W) and one in the middle of the UFO that was flashing. It was a really dark figure and it was about 60 ft above the ground, which is very low for any type of plane. I would say it was going about 15 mph ground speed. Many other people heard it, but didnt know what it was. I am one of the few that actually saw it.;37.2150483870967;-121.97301827957
