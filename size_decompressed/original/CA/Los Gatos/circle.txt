Shooting Star that made immediate 90 degree turn;2008-02-12 21:58:00;2 Seconds;Shooting Star that made immediate 90 degree turn I was on the phone with a friend in my backyard and happened to look up towards the western sky just as what I though to be a shooting scar was streaking across the sky away from me and towards the west. About one second and 45 Degrees across the sky later the object promptly made a complete 90 degree turn towards the south and one second later vanished out of view. I have watched many meteor showers looking the exact same direction in my backyard before and have never seen anything like this, the amazingly effortless change in direction made me immediately believe that it was a UFO. I was so shocked that I went quite on the phone for several seconds until I finally came to and alerted my friend of what I had just witnessed. Unfortunately he lives on the east coast and did not see it.;37.2150483870967;-121.97301827957
