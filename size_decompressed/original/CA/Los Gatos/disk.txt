Object darted accross the sky and finally hovered about 100 feet from my house.  Was extremely quite and had red lights that circled its middle.  After a few minutes the object took off very fast going to the NW. On February, 1986 I was looking toward the South at the ocean.  We have a great view of Santa Cruz all the way to Monterey.  I noticed a small round object in the sky coming from the South.  It caught my attention because of the strange way it was darting from one side of my view to the other.  Their was a band of red lights circling the middle part of the saucer shaped object.  So I watched for a few minutes as it neared my house.  I expected that when it got nearer that I would hear a sound from the engine, believing at the time that it was a plane or helicopter. This strange object stopped just 100 feet short of my house and hovered there quietely.  At this point my sister came to see what I was yelling about.  She also saw this strange object and wondered what it was.  I quickly ran inside to get my telescope to get a clearer picture of what I was seeing.  AS I was struggling to get the tripod out the back door the object took off very fast making a beeline for the North West. I tried to follow it with my eyes running around the side of the house but it disappeared very quickly. The things that stood out: moved very fast, was very quite, and was in the shape of a round saucer with red lights.  The zig zag pattern was very interesting to watch and it did not do that when it darted away.  The saucers color was dark with red lights. My sister and I still talk about what we saw at dusk that evening.;37.2150483870967;-121.97301827957
