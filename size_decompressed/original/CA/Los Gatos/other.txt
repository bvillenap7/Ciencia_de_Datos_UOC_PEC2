A vibrant white cone of light that faded leaving a glowing blue phenomenon which persisted for many minutes and witnessed by three.;2000-01-18 18:25:00;15 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB near Los Angeles.)) Avibrant white cone of light that faded leaving a glowing blue phenomenon which persisted for many minutes and witnessed by three. I saw a what looked like any normal police helicopter search light, however the field of light was more vibrant yet its range was not as far (for the white light).  The white field was in a cone shape and from the the inner-tip projected a long blue beam of light that was unlike anything I could easily describe.  The long beam got longer and the white cone light faded by time I got a good look.  What struck me that this was a U.F.O. was because after whatever was producing the cone had faded into the night sky the blue beam remained for another 20 minutes or so.  To make sure I was seeing what I was seeing I asked my girlfriend and my next door neighbor to come witness the long blue glow as it just sat there in the sky slowly fading.  They both saw the phenomenon and were both baffled as to what it could be.  I hope I'm not the only person in the area to see and report this because this event happened right over our downtown area and was also very close to a major freeway of Silicon Valley.  After witnessing the event we also noticed high aircraft (planes) out of normal traffic patterns flying very close to the glowing area and when I immediately came in to report this we experienced a boot-up problem never before experienced on our brand new computer.  Please E-mail me about any other sightings in this area.  Thank you.;37.2150483870967;-121.97301827957
