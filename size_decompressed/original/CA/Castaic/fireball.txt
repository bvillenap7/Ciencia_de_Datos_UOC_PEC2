Perfectly round in size come out of the sky, at a downward-slanted position , disappear behind the mtns., as if it was heading towards Edwards Air Force Base in Lancaster. I'm a truck driver. I was traveling northbound on I-5 and exactly at 23:51 hrs. (check clock) I seen this brilliantly lit greenish-white, perfectly round fireball. It was moving at a very fast pace at a downward-slanted position. Disappeared behind the mountains, but seemed to be headed towards Edwards Air Base in Lancaster. Really didn't believe what I was seeing and ask the driver in front of me if he had seen it. He said he hadn't seen anything, no one was going to call him crazy. But I know it was real, the cb radio has never been so quiet and nothing was said for minutes. I wanted to get off the hwy. and call Art Bell, but remembered he had a repeat show on that night. I'm really not sure if it was 9/18 or 9/23, but diffenently one of those days. By now I'm watching the skies like crazy and 2 weeks later I was coming off Tehachipi Mtn., west bound on hwy.58 into Bakersfield, it was cloudy night, but there was this one star like object in the sky in the southern direction. It's light kept going on and off like it was sending some kind of morse code, then finally went out and disappeared. This went on for about for almost 20 minutes. I really felt it was talking to something. If you wish to contact me at anytime, I will gladly pay for the call (see occ. section for info). In the meantime, I'll be watching the skies.Keep up the good work.;34.4827;-118.6254
