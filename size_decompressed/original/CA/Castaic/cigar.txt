It appeared to be a really bright star on the initial sighting,,,I was alerted to it by a phone call from my parents.  I went to the roof og\f my location, with 3 others and saw what my parents had seen, and  described,,,a bright star to the naked eye,,,but on further exanmination ,appeared to be moving and pulsating,with red and blue/green lights.  It would move back and forth,,,up and down... We used a pair of binocullars and could make out a cigar shape. It was moving in the sky but kept the same general position, moving back and forth.;34.4827;-118.6254
