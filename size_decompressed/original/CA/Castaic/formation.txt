I witnessed what I thought was a craft with three sets of lights in a triangular formation separate and take positions miles apart from one another.  These separate craft either had multiple lights, or strobed hues of redish and blue light.   They moved faster than I could track with my eye.  One made a slingshot maneuver around another then disappeared and reappeared miles away from the staionary craft.  The three lights came back into formation and disappeared from view.   A few seconds later I saw three bright white lights close to the ground then dissappear from view entirely. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter,  Yes, it was the evening of the 8th, not the 9th.  Sorry for any confusion. ((END ADDENDUM));34.4827;-118.6254
