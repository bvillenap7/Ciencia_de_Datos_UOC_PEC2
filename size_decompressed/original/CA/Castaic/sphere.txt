June 14, 2008.  11:50 pm. (approx.)   My husband and I were glued to the tube when suddenly a bright flash drew my attention to the sheer-curtained window to the Northwest. It was bright and seemlingly very close (when compared to a normal object in the sky) - spherical in shape and greenish-yellow in color, coming from the southeast.   Without a word, we both bolted to the balcony and stared in amazement at a completely still and lifeless sky. My husband says, That is the ((deleted)) craziest ((deleted)) I've ever seen((deleted))!    Wonder if anyone else saw it.
