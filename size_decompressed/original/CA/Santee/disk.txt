UFO CAPTURED OVER HAUNTED 1913 BARN;2013-05-07 14:30:00;A few minutes;UFO CAPTURED OVER HAUNTED 1913 BARN I am the ((deleted--senior officer) of the ((deleted--academic group)).  I was taking updated pics of our 1913 barn, about 2-2:30 in the after noon.  I was looking back and forth on my LCD screen and the shot I wanted.  I waited a bit cause when I walked on the dry grass a grasshopper and butterfly came from it, I waited till I saw the butterfly move off to the right and land on a tall weed.  Then, I took the pic, and continued walking towards the barn taking two more.   I reviewed the pics on my camera, but didn't notice anything unusual, until I loaded it to my folder.  Wondering what it was I zoomed in once, surprised by what it may have been I zoomed in again, and there is where I clearly saw it was not an airplane, even though I never heard any sounds of an aircraft, I only assumed it was a bird or aircraft before I cropped it.  I was informed there was no military exercise performed within the area that day.   Also learned there was only one other sighting reported in Santee, same month, but different day.   barn is haunted, would this UFO have anything to do with it? ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photo, and we suspect that the object is either a bird in flight, with its wings folded, or possibly a winged insect.  We suspect that the object is not a genuine UFO, but we cannot be certain.  PD));32.8466;-116.977
