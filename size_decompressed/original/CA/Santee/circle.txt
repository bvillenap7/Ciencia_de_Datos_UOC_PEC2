Circular white object, Hovered and moved, alt. approx. 50,000 ft.,... Not a Drifting balloon;2004-08-22 12:30:00;10-15  Min.;Circular white object, Hovered and moved, alt. approx. 50,000 ft.,... Not a Drifting balloon Sunday afternoon, as we were leaving for the swapmeet, I noticed a plastic grocery bag caught in the wind about 50 ft. up. (we live approx. 50 yards from highway 67). As it fluttered by I noticed a white circle hovering high above not moving for about five minutes, then slowly moved up and hovered some more. The second move, made the object appear to rise as it got smaller. I live close to gillespie field airport, and I'm not a professional, but this was not a plane or balloon. This was broad daylight. We observed this object 10-15 min. with binoculars and digital camera. It still appeared round. I took three pictures of the area hoping to catch it, and then a picture of a small cessna aircraft for reference. The first three pics showed nothing. Strangley the cessna pic has a strange object near it, not seen when taking the photo. Oddly enough I saw the same object today, from La Mesa at 1600 or 4:00pm. My wife was in the bank when I went to open the rear of our Jeep for air, to be honest it startled me see the same white hovering circle. It moved over highway 8 very high 50,000 ft. north two times at five minute or so intervals then became smaller and rose out of sight. This was no drifting weather balloon, it moved with purpose. I'd be glad to E-mail you the pic with the Cessna and object, and the others too, but I couldn't find it in the pics, I'm sure you have better photo enhancement programs. Thank you.;32.8466;-116.977

When viewed through binoculars there were actually multiple individual lights, at least 20 in number filling a circular pattern.  It appeared that the object may have been rotating very very slowly.
