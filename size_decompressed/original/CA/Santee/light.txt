It was a warm Labor Day, I was working as a part time security shift at the Roadway Trucking station. It was my second year working there. On the second year I gradually developed the urge to start looking up into the sky. On that day I was speaking to a friend from a private business just down the hill, who walked his dog four times a day past the compound. We were discussing the possibility of UFOs and aliens, as we often did. At a point I complained to him something to the effect, I've been watching the sky around here for a long time. I know other people have seen UFOs. How come I never seen any? Before long my friend and his Dog returned to their place down the hill. Approximately 45 minutes later, at twilight, I was listening to a program on my small radio and walking across the property from west toward the one building on the compound to the east. To my left, high in the sky higher than most of the local aircraft flew in the area, and travelling a bit faster, was a lighted object traveling from north to south. I then said to myself, What's this? As I watched, the object began flying in an up and down pattern once, and then again, and possibly a third time but I can't be sure. But certainly at least two times. I never seen aircraft fly in this manner and I knew that no conventional craft could do that. The object traveled along after the unusual aerial display and then suddenly blinked out.It didn't burn out like meteors and shooting stars, but blinked out, and I've witnessed enought meteors to know the difference. The sky was clear and light enough where I would be able to locate it in the event it had turned in another direction, but I could not find it. It was just gone. No acceleration, just gone, as if it had gone into another dimension, if you can imagine that. At that point I began to realize that I had just witnessed my first and so far, only UFO. And it showed up within 45 minutes after complaining out loud that I have never seen one. It was as though someone heard m! y complaint and decided to show themselves to me. My friend and his dog returned shortly after dark and I told him that I indeed had seen a UFO. My friend started to explain the UFO away but then started offering an explanation on how we on Earth began with the wheel and the aliens began with flight as if he knew all about something. The next day I was working in Chula Vista making a patrol around a large motel and spotted a black car parked in the rear of the building with its windows so dark I could hardly see inside. The vehicle was not on the motel guest list. I won't go into detail the remainder of that incident.  But I'll end this by saying that my report is the honest to God truth exactly as I have told it. I swear on a stack of Bibles. I don't know what the object was or its origins but I never seen anything like it prior nor after it. I am retired military and observed many times aircraft in the sky, but again, nothing that came close to the lighted object and its impossible aerial performance.

A bright flourescent green light hovered between 2 houses then swiftly moved to left and then moved directly over us while we sat in ca;1995-10-15 01:30:00;08 seconds;A bright flourescent green light hovered between 2 houses then swiftly moved to left and then moved directly over us while we sat in car. My friend and I sat in a parked vehicle one night (after a rain storm) and as we spoke, I witnessed a bright flourescent ball of light (like the color of a glo-stick) hovering between my house and the neighbor's house to the left.  When I realized that the ball of light seemed to be suspended there for a few seconds it caught my full attention.  The ball moved quickly to the left, and for a brief moment sat in the center above the neighbor's roof.  I was trying to make sense of the unknown light and look for the source from where it could have been shining from.  When I did this, I moved my body so I could have a better view out of the windshield.  I believe I caught the attention of the ball and then it *immediately* made a bee-line for what seemed to be my face.  The ball came at me diagonally from the neighbor's roof area.  I screamed aloud.  Just then, the light came upon the top of the car.  It seemed to spread itself out atop the hood of the car.  It moved from the grill area all the way up over the windshield. The shape was almost that of something gelatinous or vaporous when it came onto the car.  In other words, it didnt move as light would move. It seemed to fill the car in a white light with a green tinge to it.  It was *extremely* bright at this period.  I recall feeling very warm and somewhat disoriented. It felt like the light consumed the space around my body that I was no longer in a car that I was now by myself in the light.  Then all of a sudden it was gone.  Now, to go back to the point where I screamed--at that time, my friend also screamed for he was reacting to my scream.  He did not see the light in the ball form, nor did he see the light on the hood, nor in the car. In fact, he was not sure why I had screamed. However, he did see the light move down the back window of the car and then vanish.  I did not see the light in the back window nor did I see the light vanish. I wanted to mention that my house is on the east side of the street.  Our vehicle was parked inbetween my house and the neighbors house to the left.  My friend was seated in the drivers seat and I was laying across the passengers seat and my head was on his lap--and yes, I was facing upwards looking at him as we spoke.  We were quite still in movement and I dont think that this ball of light knew we were there until I made movement to look closer at it out of the windshield.  I wanted to mention that the radio was turned on at a very low volume.  After the green ball of light left, it increased in volume.  This could have been because my friends knee hit the radio knob, yet I am still uncertain.  I will also mention that I did check the time when I went into the house and was quite surprised to learn that it was *much* later than I had anticipated, although the experience seemed to only last seconds. The entire event felt draining and exhaustive.  After six months or so had passed, I began to notice that I had a marked increase in my ability to learn and my ability to understand analytical issues.  I had wanted to report this experience when it had happened, yet I was too shy or perhaps still questioning what had really happened that night.  I have since witnessed another green ball light experience in the same city at a different location with a different witness.  This time, there were 3 balls of light and much further off in the distance.  The experience this time included only the sighting.  This sighting was approx. 11/10/97.  I will be happy to give you the details should you be interested in that experience.  Now it seems to me that I know what I experienced the first time was real so I have decided to finally report the incident. I will be more than happy to supply my background information to you upon request.  I am uncertain as to what you would like to know in that regard.  Thank you.;32.8466;-116.977

As soon as I looked they shot straight up at an amazing speed and disappeared. My friend and I were parked in my car talking. She was looking straight ahead while I looking at her, when she suddenly said look!. I immediately looked in the direction she was looking, just in time to see three green balls of light in the distance about 50 yards away. They shot straight up at an amazing speed and disappeared. There were trails, but I believe the trails were caused by the objects moving so rapidly. This is to corroborate ((Name deleted)) experience on the same date (11/10/97).

Turning at a 80 degree angle dropping then droppin an object of the same color that faded away. then the moveing object itself then faded away Sunday Morning while with 7 other friends in the Parking lot of Vons (North Park). I looked up and to the north I saw an amber orange glowing object that was no more then 3 miles high slowly flying in our direction (South). As it flew slowly, amber light was always glowing, but would increase and decrease its intensity. It would hold its glow for 5 seconds then it would brighten and hold for 5 seconds then decrease again for 5 seconds. This continued for 2 minutes until the object itself made an 80 degree left turn towards the east over Santee. Less then a minute after it had turned the object had dropped some sort of light that looked like an ember of the the same color of the flying object itself, the object dropped quickly faded to nothing and the object moveing slowly increased its speed and the light was gone. This event had no sound at all..;32.8466;-116.977
One red light over El Cajon during the 9pm fireworks displays.;2005-07-04 21:03:00;14 minutes;One red light over El Cajon during the 9pm fireworks displays. I was in my backyard with my telescope (41x mag, 60mm refractor, f/15) and a pair of 10x50mm binoculars to look for this very object(s) as seen last 4th of July at the same time in the same general area of the sky.  I first spotted it a 9:03pm (Sprint time on my cell phone) at approximately 123-degrees magnetic bearing from my location at approx. 7-degrees elevation.  It was a bright, steady red light, comparable in brightness to that of the red navigation light on a small general aviation aircraft, of which there were two or three in the south pattern at Gillespie Field Airport at the time.  The color of red seemed slightly deeper than standard navigation light red.  The object was moving very slowly but steadily from south to north and ascending slightly.  After about 5 minutes, it began to flicker a bit.  The flickering progressed with time to where at 9:15pm it was flickering as if a flame being blown by wind.  No regularity to the flickering.  At 9:17pm, the light flickered out as if it was a flame source that ran out of fuel.  I watched it through the telescope as the last glimmer of its light flickered out...and it was gone.  Last bearing, approx. 107-deg magnetic, 12-deg elevation.  (Based on alignment with Polaris(north star) and subtracting local magnetic variation of about 13-deg.)  Its appearance through the telescope gave no more details than looking at a bright star through the telescope.  There was no smoke trail visible as I might expect from a burning flare.  flares can leave a smoke trail in the air that their own light will illuminate.  There was no parachute or balloon visible that might have been illuminated by the light of a flare.  No falling sparks visible.  The 9pm local airport weather reports: Montgomery Fld - Clear 64/56 75% NW6  29.97R Gillespie Fld - Clear 66/55 68%  Calm 29.97R Ramona        - Clear 59/53 80%  W6   29.98R  Winds aloft forecast for SAN 050600Z (forecast period begins 2 hours after the event, but should be close): 3000 feet  -- 320deg @ 7kts 6000 feet  -- 280 @ 12 -- +22deg C 9000 feet  -- 250 @ 17 -- +18deg C 12000 ft   -- 250 @ 21 -- +11deg C 18000 ft   -- 310 @ 09 -- -4deg C 24000 ft   -- 270 @ 16 -- -17deg C 30000 ft   -- 270 @ 24 -- -33deg C 34000 ft   -- 280 @ 35 -- -41deg C 39000 ft   -- 290 @ 34 -- -51deg C 45000 ft   -- 290 @ 27 -- -63deg C 53000 ft   -- 280 @ 14 -- -70deg C  My guess (only a guess) is that this was some sort of smokeless flare or other high intensity red flaming device carried aloft by one or more black helium ballons.  It may have been launched from the vicinity of Grossmont College and carried to the east by light winds to over El Cajon where it extinguished.  Last year I saw two such objects simultaneously, for the same duration, on the same date, at the same time, in the same general area of the sky.  And those objects appeared and behaved the same.  Someone's pulling a prank.  If we get precise bearings from other witnesses in San Diego County, we may be able to triangulate a ground track for this object.;32.8466;-116.977

I, along with two women, observed in the early W night sky (6PM), an object that appeared to be an aircraft (10,000ft. Elv.?).;2015-11-07 18:00:00;5 minutes;I, along with two women observed in the early west night sky (6PM), an object that appeared to be an aircraft (10,000ft. Elv.?).  At first it appeared to be flying towards us head on (with its bright headlight on).  It appeared to be pulling something (a banner) Or a large vapor trail?  There was no sound nor flashing red/green or strob lights.  Then the aircraft discharged something that grew very bright white and defused light.  The bright defused light resembled a bright light shining through a mist/fog. It was a clear night.  Associated with this bright light was a blue misty light.  After a few minutes (2-3 min.), we could observe the aircraft continuing to travel northward, but, reduced in size/brightness of that of the planet Mars (no flashing red nor green lights).  The aircraft was flying from south to north in the night sky.  There is a small commercial airport (Galespie Field) in the city of El Cajon. about three miles south of the observed sighti! ng location.  I, nor the two woman observers have never seen anything like this before.  I wish send three photos of what the object looked like.  I will also send a video rap up of the event.  I will title it Santee, CA UFO sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));32.8466;-116.977
