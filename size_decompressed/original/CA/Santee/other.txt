Blobs of fire falling from sky.;2014-11-15 05:30:00;5 minutes;Blobs of fire falling from sky. After visiting with friends on the Barona Rez followed by a visit to the casino, my friend and I headed for home around 5:30 am.  While I drove through Santee, (52 freeway headed west ), I noticed what looked like liquid fire hanging from what appeared to be a stationary light, (looked like a star only this was not that high off the ground).  I grabbed my friends arm made sure she saw it too.  (We couldn't come up with anything to explain what we were seeing)  There was a light in the sky, not moving, and hanging off of that light was a large drop of fire (if that makes any sense).  It stretched until it broke free and then fell towards the ground.   Then more fire replaced that fire but this time in much smaller drops that fell quicker and in groups as well as by themselves.  It was so weird.  As I got onto the 125 I was facing the action again for a brief moment and even though I figured it was over I not only saw more fire falling from that light, I also now saw! fire globs dropping off of nothing.  At least I couldn't see the fire attached to any light or any other object.....probably the weirdest and most undeniable strange event I have ever witnessed.   We saw the event up close and for a relatively long time-in other words there is no way I am mistaken about what I saw....no mind playing tricks on me or optical illusions either.   This occurred early this morning in Santee, Ca, where I was fortunate enough to be able to witness a good portion of it as it happened.  I  know that many others had to have seen this as well.;32.8466;-116.977
