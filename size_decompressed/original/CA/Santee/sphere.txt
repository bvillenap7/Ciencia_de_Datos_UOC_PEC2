It came closer until it was about 200 ft. away and about 100 ft. off the ground.  It was perfectly spherical.  It was a metallic blue color with lights on the top and bottom.  It flew North after about 3 minutes. At about 5:40 P.M., I was feeding my dog.  I noticed a bright greenish light in the sky.  It came closer until it was probably 200 ft. away and 100 ft. off the ground.  It made no sound at all.  It was a metallic blue color, with green and white lights on the top and bottom.
