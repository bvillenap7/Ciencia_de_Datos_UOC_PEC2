100 Star sized UFOs move in formation over southwest!;2001-04-05 00:53:00;25min;100 Star sized UFOs move in formation over southwest! this is a copy of the message I sent to Art Bell, I and my friend viewed these lights from San Diego on the morning of 4/5 from 12:53am to 1:20am. Your show alerted us that reports were coming in concerning lights just south of the San Diego border. I walked outside not really thinking I would see anything. Boy was I wrong! About 100 or more star sized nonflashing lights were moving in a loose formation across the sky from north to south. It was totally incredible! An armada of UFOs. I got out my big fujinon 10x70 binoculars and watched them move all the way across the horizon. I could see no detail even with the fujinons. They were so high up they must each have been huge to be so bright when viewed from ground level. This was a major display that I think was more shocking than the phoenix lights. Again let me repeat, over 100 star sized solid white lights moving together in formation across the background starfield. They were not stars. You must investigate this. I never thought UFOs were real, now I have seen 100 at once!;32.8466;-116.977
Santee, Ca A Hugh silent craft without lights was stationary in the sky above my home and was painted like a bird. 6/28/2019 9PM;2019-06-28 21:00:00;<1 minute;Santee, Ca A Hugh silent craft without lights was stationary in the sky above my home and was painted like a bird. 6/28/2019 9PM On June 28, 2019 approximately 9 PM I went outside as usual to look at the night sky and see if it was clear enough to bring out the telescope and ended up seeing something which “I did not know what it was” and it frightened me enough that I ran back inside.  For less than a minute I saw up in the sky the painted surface of something which was stationary and silent, above me at about 45 degree angle from the horizon while using my binoculars. I didn’t see the entire object but what I saw was unusually large, I guessed the part I saw was over 300 feet wide and very tall maybe 150 feet because it filled my field of view, it had no lights, silent and the surface was painted like a bird, it had  burnt-orange-brown colored feathers “painted” on the hull. I saw some detail on the surface, an outline of two rectangles intersecting on the surface of the craft which looked like hatches or access panels. I dropped the binoculars from my eyes and looked and could not see it. I made a half ass attempt to locate it again with the binoculars but no luck, I was frightened and I wanted to go back inside quickly away from it. I don’t know what it was. I don’t think we can make a craft like that yet though. I believe my binoculars helped see past the cloaking they were using, it is the only explanation as to why I couldn’t see it when not looking through the binoculars. It was huge and cloaked and real.;32.8466;-116.977
In the air and over 300 foot large, a burnt-orange/brown color which appeared to be feathers painted on the exterior object.;2019-06-28 21:30:00;50 seconds;In the air and over 300 foot large, a burnt-orange/brown color which appeared to be feathers painted on the exterior object. I was going to use my telescope, but first I went outside to scout it out with my 7x35 binoculars, looking for a certain star and locate the asteroid Pallas at 9:30 PM June 28th 2019 looking East and up about 45 degrees.  Caught sight of very large object over 300 feet which filled my FOV (300 feet @ 1000 yards).  Object was a strange color burnt-orange/brown and looked like bird feathers painted on the outside.  I saw what looked like two square panels which were also painted and attached to the exterior.  It was to large to be a bird and I did not see the whole object because I locked on it at first not moving and then suddenly as I took the binoculars away from my eyes to look for it because I thought it was so large I should be able to see it, but I couldn’t see it.  I tried to find it again with the binoculars but to no avail. Maybe it was cloaked and only with binoculars can you see it?  I’m an astronomer, chemist, engineering technician, computer professiona! l, bird watcher and first responder and I deal with facts. I never saw anything like that and I was not able to ID it. It made no noise had no lights and was very large and right there in the air right above me.;32.8466;-116.977
Three separate fast moving objects left a trail behind them from 22,000 to about 5,000 feet and began to group together;2020-02-19 11:07:00;00:05;Three separate fast moving objects left a trail behind them from 22,000 to about 5,000 feet and began to group together Taking the trash out and heard jets and saw two F35’s bugging out heading NW at about 1000 foot altitude.  Looked around the sky and I didn’t see anything so I went inside and checked my seven cameras I have set up to record the sky.  I had to zoom in on my DVR video display to see the three objects they were about seven miles from me and about 20,000 up. So I caught three objects in the clouds about 7 miles from me, they entered my camera 1 view in the clouds and came into view somewhat horizontally but at about a 15 degree angle traveling through and then just below the clouds traveling about 20-25,000mph and taking separate paths and began descending at a greater angle and joining together afterwards at 3500-7000 feet and about a 50 mile distance. The  two F35’s were heading North West at high speed they had their afterburners on I saw the smoke, towards their location. The Three objects entered with separate paths miles apart and they were leaving a trail! . Their individual paths changed like they turned then moved towards each other and  they all seem to come together or form up together purposely. I estimated the miles, speeds and elevations. raw video available and I caught video on three cameras;32.8466;-116.977
