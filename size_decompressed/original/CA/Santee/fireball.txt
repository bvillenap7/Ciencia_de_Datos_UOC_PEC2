While driving home from Santee, CA, heading South on HWY.125 (about one mile South of the Intersection of Mission Gorge Rd. & HWY.125, I saw a falling object/fireball through my front windshield that was emerald green in color.  It was visible for about three seconds, going out of sight near ground level behind a hillside.  It consisted of a main emerald green fireball with what looked like small pieces breaking away from the main object (leaving a small trail).  It was falling in a slight  North to South direction.;32.8466;-116.977

Appeared low in atmosphere, and larger in diameter than a shooting star.   Hill obscured the eastern horizon so my view was blocked as it transitted eastward.   Characteristics appear identical to green meteors described and videoed.;32.8466;-116.977
