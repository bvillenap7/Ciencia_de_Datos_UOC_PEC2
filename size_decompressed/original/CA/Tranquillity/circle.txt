bright white lite near Tranquillity/ Mendota;2006-05-23 22:34:00;3 min;bright white lite near Tranquillity/ Mendota While I and my girlfriend where driving home on Whitesbrige (180) west I was looking straight toward the city of Mendota and up in the sky appeared this bright illuminated white light. She said it was a plane, but I've seen a plane at night and this (UFO) didnt have no flickering lights like planes do at night. It was moving slow to the left and as if it was turning to the left cause the white light would get brighter and than it dissappeared. Than like a minute later we seen it again, this time we were going south on James and seen it as if it was like in the foothills near I5.;36.659;-120.2567
