When I walked into my bedroom I saw I'd left the drapes pulled completely back, so I decided not to turn on my lamp just yet. I stepped to the window instead just to look out at the street and the sky.  And standing there in the dark of my room, I see what I'd best describe as a luminous green object, shoot downward from the southeast. It headed in a mostly western direction and slightly to the north. It was larger than the Hale-Bopp comet had been when it appeared in out skies, with an appearance similar to a comet, having a tail. Quite good sized, considering it was under the cloud cover.  You know how fast a shooting star is?  Well that's how this thing moved - *that fast!  It disappeared from my vision when it passed the roofline of the 2-story building across the street. I turned to my clock to see it was 11:00 p.m. Since I'm not sure what the definition of a green fireball is, I don't know if that's what I saw. But I can tell you I was kinda dumbfounded.  I just stood there and quietly said, What was *that. This was nothing like any of the other craft I've seen over the years, that's for sure.;34.0084999999999;-117.8136
