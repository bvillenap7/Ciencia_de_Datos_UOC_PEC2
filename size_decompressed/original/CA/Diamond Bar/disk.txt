Observed disk shaped craft with dome while traveling n/bound on 57 FWY.;1999-11-16 07:15:00;30 seconds;Observed disk shaped craft with dome while traveling n/bound on 57 FWY. While traveling northbound on the 57 freeway thru the city of Diamond Bar, driving my semi-tractor and trailer, I saw a white or highly reflective disk shaped object move from right to left ( westbound ) across my field of vision. The object had no appendages except for a slight dome on top which appeared which less reflective or more translucent than the rest of the craft. Having flown and soloed in aircraft ( but never completed enough hours for a private rating ) before, I would estimate its altitude as somewhere around 5,000 feet, its airspeed between 100-125 knots, and its distance from me possibly 3-5 miles. Although I didn't have time to look around while driving, I'm sure others must have seen this incredible sight too.;34.0084999999999;-117.8136
