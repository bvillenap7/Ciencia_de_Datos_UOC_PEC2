Green pulse seen in Diamond Bar last Friday night. I did not report it until I heard people in Seattle have seen one. I thought you should know. It is the second green pulse light see in a year over Diamond Bar. The one Friday night at appox. 9:00 showed up very low like 1500 feet in distance. It was stopped in air, and went down toward earth. The area I figure was a hills and cows pasters. It was a green, light that flashed also white, but pulsed more green.;34.0084999999999;-117.8136
