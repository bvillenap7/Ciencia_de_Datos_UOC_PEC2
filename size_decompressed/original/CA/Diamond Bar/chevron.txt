Huge flying saucer type object observed closely on Pomona Fwy near Diamond Bar, CA in 1978.;1977-09-01 18:30:00;20 minutes;Huge flying saucer type object observed closely on Pomona Fwy near Diamond Bar, CA in 1978. This incident has bothered me for years.  I had just finished a round of golf at Friendly Hills Country Club in Whittier and was headed of the Victoria Station in Covina to meet friends for dinner. We had not been drinking and I do not do drugs and I was a corporate executive in downtown LA at the time.  I entered the Pomona Fwy just east of the 605 Fwy at Hacienda.  I headed east looking to catch the Orange Fwy North to the San Bernardino Fwy.  i noticed as I got on the Fwy what looked like headlights or landing lights for a jet coming in and it seemed low to me.  The traffic started getting slow and I began to notice the lights closer to the fwy and wondered if not a plane going to LAX if could be lights for workmen or perhaps a movie being made, which is common in the LA area.  As I got close somewhere near the Orange Fwy connection what I was observing was a huge object with many lights on the bottom just hovering about 100 feet over the freeway.  The traffic was just crawling and some had pulled over and were our of their cars including The CHP.  I got a good closeup look as I drove directly under it and seemed to be in shock.  i elected not to stop so continied on and noted that a mile or so away off to the southwest in a residential area in Diamond Bar was another similiar strange vehicle hovering over homes on a hill.  I continued to my destination.  I never heard anything on the news or from another person but at that time of day hundreds if not thousands had to have seen what I saw.
