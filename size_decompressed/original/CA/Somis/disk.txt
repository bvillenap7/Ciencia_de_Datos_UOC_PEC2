As I got in my car and was driving away I noticed it follwing me.  I thought it was just my imagination fooling with me so I continued to drive on.  As I reached my house, which is in a rural rea, the light on the ship seemed to continously change color.  It went from green to yellow to blur then back to green.  I found this to be very odd so I called my sister outside.  She got out the binicolors and noticed that there was tiny little windows in this ship with something looking at her but she couldn't make t out for sure.  But as soon as we entered our house we heard a boomb.  We walked outside and say the ship fyling away. ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of a flurry of reports we received from Ventura County, CA, following three telephone calls we received on May 18, 2002, from a raucous student party.  The reports seemed to us to be not convincing at the time of the call, a fact which we shared with the callers.  Shortly afterwards, approximately a dozen reports were submitted from that area.  We have no way of confirming any of these reports.  PD));34.2777;-119.0155
