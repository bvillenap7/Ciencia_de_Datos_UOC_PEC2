Fireball falling at slow speed then flew upwards at high rate of speed without turning around made no noise as it sped upwards.;2014-01-11 19:00:00;5 minutes;Fireball falling at slow speed then flew upwards at high rate of speed without turning around made no noise as it sped upwards. Fireball dropping from sky at very slow rate then it stopped and flew back upwards at an extremely high rate of speed until it disappeared.  I have seen this before and this time many others saw it that pulled over to watch as it descended and ascended many people began filming it and some started screaming when it turned around and went back up.   This was no plane seeing as I live less then 5 minutes from an Air Force base I have seen many odd things but never one so fast before.
