Bright light seen over Palmdale, minute later disappeared and blue luminescent 'cloud' was left in its place.;2015-11-07 18:00:00;15 minutes;Bright light seen over Palmdale, minute later disappeared and blue luminescent 'cloud' was left in it's place. Me and a friend both spotted what appeared to be a bright light in the sky, and when we went inside to grab a camera, it disappeared and all was left was a blue glowing luminescent 'cloud' where the light was. The blue glow stretched out and looked like a comet at first, and then we noticed it went back to a oval shaped cloud, and minutes later, it disappeared as well. Also, when we first got back outside, we noticed another smaller blue luminescent a little bit away from it, and shaped like a tipped over 'V'. (Side note: Other people that my friend knew also reported the light and cloud as well) ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
