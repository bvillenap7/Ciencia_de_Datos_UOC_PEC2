There were no clouds. While they sighted this event Mike called his girlfriend on his cell phone and while taking the cell phone died. Then the camera they had which was fully charged died and would not work. The camera noted Battery Dead. When both returned home the cell phone worked and the camera as it was placed in its charger stated it had a full charge. Location was 47th and S streets. Time of sighting between 1:00 - 2:00 am Aug 16th. The craft were said to be at the height of high altitude jet flight patterns 20,000'. At arms length holding a quarter the craft seemed to be the size of a quarter. No noise was associated with this event. The triangles had a half sphere shape to them. The men saw high definition shapes in the crafts bodies.  ((name and URL deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We cannot guarantee that this is a serious report.

Giant triangle stealth like craft hovering over California dessert;2005-12-06 11:00:00;15 minutes;Giant triangle stealth like craft hovering over California dessert Just wanted to report that My wife and I saw a craft, which we think was man made in the area east of Palmdale ca on our way back from a trip from Las vegas. As we live in la, we where traving south on the 1-15 and we had either just passed or were just approaching the 210 connection.  What was super strange about this sighting, is that this plane was huge. I would guestimate at least 4 to six times the size of the biggest bomber plane that I have ever seen. To say that it was about the size of a football field would possibly be accurate, but I have no way of accurately reporting the size for sure. This palne was incredible, and my web research it looks identical to the Black mantra or giant stealth bomber other peoples have seen.  What made this most remarkable is the craft drifted, at a very slow speed, that of the speed of a blimp, and maybe ever slower. In direction it seemed to be doing large circles around the town to our drivers side, and it would go way west of us, and then circle back. It seemed to be even holding its position for an instance, but we later realized it was just on a perspective that it must be moving in a direction towards us.  But this object was incredible, it was so massive and flew so slowly I felt it best to be reported here. It may not be an alien space craft, and I doubt it is, but l would bet this remains unidentified for some time.  My wife and I drove at 75 mph for about 15 minutes and the plane was still in view circling the city. This craft was also silent, for its size we expected to here some engine, but when we rolled down our windows we heard nothing. Maybe we were too far away, but I'd guess we were between 1-2 miles away from it. This was all a daytime experience. Thanks for letting me share my fasinating experience with you.

((HOAX??))  bottom of ship was a single sheet of orange red light, not one bulb or multiple light.;2007-04-16 21:35:00;3 seconds;bottom of ship was a single sheet of orange red light, not one bulb or multiple light  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I pulled up to highway 138 & beekly road and stopped at the light. I then witnessed an incredibly fast moving red-orange light move from right diagonally to left, it appeared to be the bottom of an entire ship light up as if it were a single sheet of light.  It then made an sharp turn and moved away from me in an upward motion and it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  Possible hoax.

Saw a triangle looking object with lights on all corners and another object following it moving fast to the east.;2015-07-16 21:10:00;2 minutes;Saw a triangle looking object with lights on all corners and another object following it moving fast to the east. Went outside, and saw two fast moving objects in the sky.  The first one had a triangle shape with lights on all 3 corners, and there was another fast moving object flying behind it that had two lights on each side.  (possibly tailing aircraft)   Both objects were headed to the east.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
Three triangular shapes with green lights;2020-09-29 18:30:00;30 seconds;Three triangular shapes with green lights On Sep 29, 2020 around 630 pm, we were driving southbound on Hwy 14 just north of Edwards Air Force Base in Palmdale, CA.  My husband and I saw small green lights, he thought there were two sets but I saw three, what could have been fast flying synchronized objects larger than my grandson’s drone.  They flew across from the northbound side to the southbound in an angled approach about 20-30 feet off the pavement.  They flew directly across our windshield view and then flew over toward the passenger side window where they appeared to hover for an instant before they took off.  I told my husband I felt like I was being stalked.  We were so surprised, and it happened so quickly that even though my cell phone was in my hand (holding it for directions) I didn’t have a moment to think about trying to get a photo.  The next exit said Edwards Air Force base so either UFOs were checking us out, or the Air Force was practicing some kind of maneuvers.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
