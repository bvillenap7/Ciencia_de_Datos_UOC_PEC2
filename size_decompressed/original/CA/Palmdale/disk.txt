When I heard Peter mention a sighting in Palmdale, California it reminded me of an experience that I am still not sure if it was real ir a dream.  I was in highschool.  I was awakened around 3AM by a strange noise outside--A Whooo--whooo--whooo sound, fairly high-pitched.  There was a sliding glass door leading from my bedroom to the back yard.  I stepped outside.  It was a clear night and cold.  About 1/4 mile or so I saw a dics-shaped object in the sky, about 500 feet off the ground. It was hovering over a residential neighborhood, making that Whooo--whooo sound.  Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, the craft darted towards my house, as if it sensed my presense.  It scared the crap out of me.  It looked to be about 100 feet in diameter.  The craft was dark, with a band of glowing orange light around the middle.  Since it hovered over my house I got a very good look at the underside.  There were 3 half-domes of glowing bright blue light.  I gaped at the craft with a mixture of terror and awe.  The next thing I remember, I was waking in my bed the next morning.  To this day, I don't know if it was real or a dream but I have never been able to shake the image of that craft hovering over my house.  I have never had a dream that felt as real as this experience felt.  But since I was the only witness, I will never know for sure.
