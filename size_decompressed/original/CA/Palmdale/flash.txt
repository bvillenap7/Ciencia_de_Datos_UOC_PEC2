Bright flash shoots a beam of light horizontally across the night sky;2012-08-25 21:00:00;3-4 seconds;Bright flash shoots a beam of light horizontally across the night sky Not sure if this counts as a UFO citing but I believe it was out of the ordinary and I remember it clearly 8 years later.  So me and my buddy were hanging out on the outskirts of Palmdale, a couple miles away from Pete Knight high school late one night.   were talking about what are plans were for after high school.  When from the corner of my eye I noticed this big bright flash in the middle of the sky.  I quickly turned my head to the direction of the flash when I suddenly saw this light shoot out of it, in a straight horizontal line across the sky.  From my point of view that beam of light traveled very fast and at the end of that another bright flash occurred.  And when the lights faded out the sky was clear again as if nothing happened.  This citing lasted about 3-4 seconds but I always wondered if anyone else got to see the bright flash of lights I saw that night.  My buddy said he didnâ€™t see anything but did notice some kind of flash up in the sky.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
