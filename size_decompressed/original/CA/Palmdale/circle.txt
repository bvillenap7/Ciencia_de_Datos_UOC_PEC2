Then went over the field and shot up and out of sight.  But the weird thing is.  We just went out in the play ground for lunch.  We saw it for about 3-5min.  As soon as it was gone the bell rang and lunch was over.  So what happened to the 30 min. Lunch.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623

Reflect a white color as the Sun light hit object. Slow moving. Black orb shape like a ballon traveling north west about a mile away from my location.  I noticed a metalic quality to the object as the sun glinting off it made the object appear white.  The object was lost due to distance and clouds. I would say the object was around 10 feet wide total.  Not very large.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
