The oval light was  brighter than a welders arc, that is a blinding bright light, the oval  light was 1,500 feet in  the sky, and was floating  in a north, south direction  over  the (14) freeway. The  light  gave  the  impression, it  came  from  a  dome round clear  window  source, or  like  a  giant  light  bulb flying  in  a  slow  motion travel. Moreover,  this  light  source  was  noiseless, and  had  only  the  very  bright white  light,  there  was  no  red & blue  lights as  in   helicopters or  small 2  seater  airplanes.

orange oval shape sat in the sky then disapperad and re-appered when two jets approached.;2008-07-30 18:00:00;1-5min;orange oval shape sat in the sky then disapperad and re-appered when two jets approached. MY wife and I were heading home in west palmdale ca. when I observed a oval yellow orange like object just sitting in the sky not doing anything,all of a sudden I noticed to jets headed in its direction coming from the tehhachappi mountains,when the jets got close the object just disappered straight up then re-appeared under them and made a huge camera like flash and began to look like a missle flying in the sky.What I saw was definetly very strange it seem like the object was watching our town then got distracted by these jets.I'M reporting this because im not sure if anyone also saw this, it wasn't even dark outside which made it easy too see. Friends and family in the A.V.had told me ufo stories,but none were like this, makes me wonder what lockheed and nasa are also doing out here. I'M now a believer of ufo's!;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
Oval-shaped aircraft with red and white lights, making a distinct buzzing sound, hovers over the Palmdale, CA, desert for 10 min..;2014-12-07 21:00:00;15 minutes;Oval-shaped aircraft with red and white lights, making a distinct buzzing sound, hovers over the Palmdale, CA, desert for 10 min.. We were walking my dogs in the desert.  It was dark and we had just started walking into my neighborhood from the desert.   I noticed an odd sound coming from a long wall that encloses houses, separating them from the desert.  At first I thought there was something in the bushes.  It was an electrical sound, kind of like bees buzzing or water running, or, a rattle-snake sound.  It was a distinct, loud buzzing vibration that I couldn't figure out.   I commented on it to my boyfriend walking behind me.  He pointed out a craft with red and white lights in a southwest position in the sky, but I kept focusing on the sound below.  The more I followed the sound vibrating in the bushes along the wall, it seemed to keep moving with me.   Finally, I realized it was coming from the space craft above us, and the sound from it was vibrating below. I had originally figured this aircraft was an airplane of some kind but upon closer observation, I realized that it was unusual how it w! as hovering in the same spot for several minutes and not moving.  It was an oval shape, and the lights and sound were the most distinctive features.  I kept watching it for a long time and then it suddenly turned off its lights and headed in a bee-line toward the mountains, which was in a western direction.   I continued to hear the unusual vibration while it became softer, and observed a dim light and shaped of the craft as it disappeared over the San Gabriel Mountains.  It moved rather fast too.   I later speculated that it was definitely a UFO and neither one of us had ever seen anything like it before, and we are elderly.  It also seemed to me that it may have been using some kind of ultra-sound to take pictures of the terrain below, or was looking for something.  It even occurred to me that it was possibly a craft using vibration or super ultra-sound to levitate.  I had heard of experiments in this area a while back.   My boyfriend and I were both amazed by this experience.  I felt unthreatened by it, at the time of the experience, and my dogs did not seem disturbed by it, but they did seem to notice the sound that we heard and were curious about it too.   Later at home, I started feeling a little uneasy at the possibility of what it could have been.  I looked up some images of UFO sightings and there was one that correlated with what we saw an oval-shaped craft with red and white lights.  The entire experience lasted for about 10 minutes.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623

I watched;2021-04-27 17:26:00;1 minute;I was sitting having dinner at the dining table and I was looking out the sliding glass door when I noticed this dark object. I watched it for about a minute trying to see what it was because I did not see  any wings tail or props anywhere the whole time I watched it go across the sky from what I figured to be a direction of east to west would be my best guess. I would say that I think the distance from which I watched the the object travel is probably a distance  of 5 to 7 miles as the crow flies as for my distance i would have to say I was probably between 3 and 5 miles if I were looking at the object directly. It was not fast probably like a cessna plane. As for the color it seemed a tone of gun metal gray but not metalic from my view point. At the time I saw it the sun would have been pretty close to being in front of the direction it was moving.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
