A flaming cylindrical object crossed the entire sky, north to south, in about 3 min.;1970-08-01 21:30:00;3 min;A flaming cylindrical object crossed the entire sky, north to south, in about 3 min. 3 of us were in the street in our neighborhood on a dark cloudless nite in Aug of 1970 (?) when we noticed a bright, red-orange-yellow flaming object crossing the sky. I first noticed it at about 40-60 degrees above the northern horizon progressing towards the south, straight overhead. There was no audible sound. It appeared to be a cylinder, but only flames were visible against the black background of the night sky. Pieces seemed to be falling behind burning up as if they were peeling off the sides of the cylinder. It's speed could be compared to a jetliner crossing the sky at 30,000 ft, but it gave me the impression of being much higher, as the flames seemed to be peeling off in slow-motion (indicating a very large object at high altitude), so we had time to consider following it in the car, as it appeared to be headed for an impact in San Gabriel mountains just south of town. There was no impact flash as it disappeared behind the mountains. It travelled in a straight line the entire time.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623

It first looked like a satellite as it came over the horizon, from the west. It then appeared over head, as if materializing, I saw no heat trail from entering the atmosphere, just a spot of light, and it was moving very fast. At first, and this happened quickly, there was only one, a green tubular shaped light. Then another slightly behind it. The second light stopped or appeared  behind the first, then the two slowly circled each other without changing orientation. That is to say they were still pointing east. They slowed to a stop and hovered for a moment side by side. They aligned  and moved east, slowly, maybe a hundred or so mph(?). And absolutely no sound. Coming or going. They were shaped like, and looked like, a fluorescent light bulb. They glowed like a black light but were green.  To say the least I was very excited. I couldn't tell how big or how high they were, I had nothing to reference from. Clear sky, no clouds no moon. But it was very clear that these were not any type of airplane or aircraft that I have ever seen. And moved like nothing I know of can. It looked like something you would see in a movie! Better, it was real!!;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
