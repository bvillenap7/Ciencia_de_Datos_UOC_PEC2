My girlfriend and I were fishing at the California Aqueduct in Palmdale, CA, on Sunday, February 27, 2005, between 5:30 PM and 6:00 PM.  We had just started packing up our stuff into my truck and from the corner of my eye I noticed a light, or reflection.  I looked in the direction of the light, and saw a pale green light moving from west to east (right to left) over the mountains in the distance.  It wasn’t moving very fast, and at first I thought it was an airplane or helicopter, but the color of the light looked odd.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend and she confirmed that she saw it too.  We watched it move in this direction for about 10 seconds or so, and then, suddenly, the light went straight up at a very fast speed and disappeared.  My girlfriend was spooked and wanted to leave immediately.  We could not tell how far away or how big it was.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
More Dissolving Stars  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites.  PD));2005-07-23 21:30:00;Hour;More Dissolving Stars We posted a report on this site last week regarding dissolving stars at our location in Lancaster, CA.  We now want to report 3 sightings within an hour while we dog sat for my sister in the hills of Palmdale last night.  My sister lives up in the hills of West Palmdale.  We went over to the house around 9pm. We checked on the dogs, and went out by the pool to relax and watch the stars. The house is situated on the hill in such a way that provides a panoramic view of the sky and the entire Antelope Valley.  As is our usual custom, we were viewing the sky.  The first star came from the southwest corridor, and even while planes were flying around, this star almost hovered as it flew in a slow, steady, northeastern direction. Like our previous sightings in Lancaster, this object dipped occasionally and then eventually dissolved.  We both confirmed what we saw: no sound, no flash pattern or lights with the exception of the objects brightness/ sphere shape.  We waited a while longer, perhaps 8 to 10 minutes, and the 2nd star appeared out of south heading in a northerly direction. This 2nd star was different, however. This time, while it made a slow, almost hover like pattern, with slight dips, etc. it made it's way into our northern view, stopped, hovered, then suddenly became extremely BRIGHT, as if someone turned on a spotlight, while it remained motionless, felt like a signal to us that we see you seeing us. Then it dimmed again, and dissolved into the same spot as the 1st star.  We waited awhile longer again, this time it was approximately 15 minutes, and eventually, another star came out of the direct west direction, made a slow, dipping, hover like pattern, and again, moved across the sky and dissolved into the same exact area of the sky (due north)  As previously stated in our post of last week, we are very close to Edwards AFB, and see many flights of different aircraft all the time and are familiar with private and military craft.  These objects are not airplanes. No sound, no flash patterns, no direct flight path, no usual flight path taken (as we are used to seeing here in the Antelope Valley)  We are reporting this again in the hope that some other people in the valley have seen the same objects in the sky. Thank You;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
4 lights in sky do strange things.;2007-06-24 02:00:00;15-20 seconds;4 lights in sky do strange things. While laying in my backyard watching for falling stars, i witnessed 4 reddish lights enter the sky with no trails (almost as if it was glowing hot metal), one light broke off and faded away, and the other three did 2 tight circles in the sky then faded away, i almost thought it was a cluster of satellites, but then they started to do the circles, and that made me do a wtf. no idea what it was, and i have no way to explain what i saw.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
Red ball of light in the eastern sky;2007-07-26 22:00:00;5 minutes;Red ball of light in the eastern sky I have been in the Air Force for 18 years,as an aircraft mechanic (Crew Chief) and the only thing I can say this thing looked like was a flare. I was coming home from work heading eastbound when I noticed a large red ball at my 11:00 position slowly decending and appearing to get bigger or brighter. I first thought was it was a firework, because of the bright red color, and the way it was decending. But after it had dimmed, it stopped it's decent, and headed north looking like a red star. I really do not know if the government has flyable flares, and if they are red, but that seems to be the logical answer. It did light up the sky, and there was no smoke trails like you see with flares. Also I could not see a parachute, like you can with flares if you are close enough. This thing did not seem close, and appeared to be at least 10 miles away, although I really can not judge do to being at night. It was bright, and it did fly away north, and I have never seen anything like it... Except Sunday or Monday night at about the same time but over El Mirage dry lake bed area. That night I was taking out the trash and noticed what appeared to be a red firework going up stopping at the top of the apex and then slowly decending and fading as it decended to a red star and continuing on east. I had dismissed this, and figured it was some kind of test with the predator. The object that I saw tonight was roughly 35 to 40 miles south of El Mirage, and I just can't explain in words just how bright it was and how red it was.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
Unidentified orange light travelling at high speed with sudden changes in direction.;2008-06-20 01:00:00;2 minutes;Unidentified orange light travelling at high speed with sudden changes in direction. A little before one o clock this morning I was laying in my friends room talking with her. My friend called me and told me to go out side and look up into the sky for an orange lighted unidentified flying object. We ran through the house to go out side and at first we did not see it because it was behind a tree but after passing the tree it became clearly visible. It appeared orange travelling at a very high speed thus confirming that it was not a usual aircraft seen in the sky. The craft travelled about five miles with in a minute to a minute and a half moving in sudden different directions. At one point it seemed as if it were moving towards us, soon after the light dissappeared. We did not take our attention off of the light at any moment.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
Abnormaly bright light hovering above the western horizon for 20 min. Very strange, piqued my curiosity.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2009-01-06 19:45:00;30 min;Abnormaly bright light hovering above the western horizon for 20 minutes. Very strange, piqued my curiosity. A very bright white light hovered 5 degrees above the western horizon for at least 20 minutes and proceeded in an easterly direction at high velocity. The white light was as intense as the moonlight but much smaller in diameter,very sharp and crisp light, more than a pinpoint of light. Usually there is a lot of military air traffic in the area, and stealth fighters are regularly seen in the area. This light caught my attention immediately when I came outside for a cigarette. It hovered and drifted very slowly too the south for 20 minutes. At first I thought it was a planet but it was much brighter than normal. I noticed the very slow movement of the object and decided it was not stationary. I observed the light for around 10 minutes and decided it was too cold for my comfort. My coworker observed its speedy departure to the east about 10 minutes after I went inside. Way too bright to be an ordinary aircraft and no blinking lights which would be expected on a helocopter.

white lights moving towards Mojave, Northern direction. No marker lights visiable with binoculars.;2010-06-25 10:28:00;3 minutes;white lights moving towards Mojave, Northern direction. No marker lights visiable with binoculars. White light like a star moving across the sky towards mojave NE.  Object was about 10 thousand feet high moving at a good clip.  I did not notice any marker lights just a solid white light as it moved away. I had binoculars I grabbed to look closer and no marker lights visiable. Just a point of light. Too low to be a satellite for sure. Not a meteor falling.  No marker lights during the 3 minutes I viewed it. after which I also saw another light high up.  Could have been a satellite.  But it was NE and traveling in an arch in the same northern direction towards Mojave.  Could be Military?   Objects were seen out my back yard.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
4 white dim lights cruising together and thought it was a plane when I noticed there was no beacon light.;2010-09-24 21:20:00;40sec;I saw 4 white dim lights cruising together and thought it was a plane when I noticed there was no beacon light. Suddenly the lights separated from each other and returned back to the original formation going southeast towards Anaverde, Palmdale, CA from over the 14 fwy. I only saw this for about 30seconds. They made no sound I only heard the freeway traffic.  The neighbor’s dogs also started howling at the time of the sighting. I’m still kind of freaked out.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
At night, a bright orange light coming toward us and suddenly disappeared.;2013-05-29 02:20:00;0.3;At night, a bright orange light coming toward us and suddenly disappeared. I woke up in the middle of the night as I often do to let the dog outside. I came back to bed and my husband woke up.  I noticed a solid orange bright light coming toward us traveling south to north, I showed my husband, as we both stared at it, trying to figure out what it was, the light suddenly disappeared and did not come back on.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
blue/green trail in sky, followed by burst of white light. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;15 seconds;blue/green trail in sky, followed by burst of white light Object was a small bright light in the sky that left behind a glowing blue/green light.  It also had a very bright triangle of white light behind it.  After a few seconds of travel, a burst of white light came from the traveling dot.  It was a large, growing, circle of light that grew bigger.  The dot then increased in speed and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
Two Fast Moving Synchronous Green Lights over Palmdale, CA.;2016-04-20 21:00:00;45 seconds;Two Fast Moving Synchronous Green Lights over Palmdale, CA. Conditions:  Clear sky, no clouds, maybe a little hazy, full moon.  Event:  Looking east from my back porch I saw two green lights moving west to east in approximately the same path as the airline traffic coming east to west flying over Palmdale as they approach, I believe, Burbank, CA, Airport.  The green lights looked as if they were attached to two separate vehicles one following the other in trail by what looked like, compared to the airliners, about one half mile.  Which is about half of what the airliners typically are spaced.  They appeared to be moving much faster than and above the airliners. Each light was a single light that in size was about the same or a little larger visual angle as the forward facing lights of the airliners.  The weird thing was that the lights were blinking in perfect unison.  This lasted for about 30 seconds or so as they continued to move east. Then, as they were pretty far off but still visible, the lights started blinking completely but perfectly opposite to each other.  This lasted another 10 – 20 seconds until they disappeared as they became too small to see. Corroboration:  My 25 year old daughter was on the porch and saw them also.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
