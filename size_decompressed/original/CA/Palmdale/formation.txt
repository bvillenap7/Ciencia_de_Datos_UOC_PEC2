On July 17, 2017, at approximately 9:20 PM- I, along with my daughter and her fiance', were sitting on our driveway, when my daughter and I saw a fireball falling from the sky in the south.  Within in seconds of seeing the fireball, my daughter's fiance' pointed out four objects that, at first glance, appeared to be four distant stars.   These objects were rotating in perfect unison in a clockwise direction.  They kept a consistant and equal distance between each other, before merging together, then forming a perfectly straight line with the same equal distance as in the clockwise rotation.   The four objects then headed south in the direction of the fireball for a short distance.  Two of the objects continued on in the direction of the fireball while the other two objects changed direction and proceeded north.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
