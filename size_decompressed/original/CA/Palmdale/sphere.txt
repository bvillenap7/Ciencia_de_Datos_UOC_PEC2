dancing light above lancaster;2005-05-01 23:00:00;5min;dancing light above lancaster I was in the field behind the old Walmart by ave P (Rancho Vista blvd) and 3rd st east, lying on my back in the dirt, because I had just been in a heated argument with my girl friend, whom I lived with at the time, and I had to leave the house, and the field was the only place I could go without having to walk around for a few hours. While I lied there, just clearing my mind, and looking at the stars and planes in the night sky, I noticed  light /sphere  approx. 30-60 miles away in the dist, high in the north sky.  It danced, almost doing loop d’ loops up and down in an erratic pattern. It seemed that it was above Lancaster , but cant say for sure.  Not beleving what I was seeing, I put my right thumb up next to it and a star  nearby and held it still to see if possibly my eyes or head were moving , but sure enough, I was able to assure myself I was not hallucinating. After a couple of minutes of watching this thing, and assuming it was some experimental craft or missile from Skunkworks, I lost interest for a few moments. When looking back to see study the object more I noticed it bob and weave, then rapidly move out of sight in a north bound direction.  For the longest time I thought it was some experimental guided missile. But why  would the Gov. test the object near a populated area. I've seen the YF22’s hovering about the palmdale airport area before and the donut shaped contrails in the nineties, but only seem something similar on future weapons.  This thing was to crazy to test around here. that’s all my gut feeling tells me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Fast bright moving object at night, level flight;2012-08-02 22:50:00;10 seconds;fast bright moving object at night, level flight I was late at night as usually hand watering the backyard garden while watching the stars, and the started following the red blinking lights of a jet airplane moving East to West, at apparently usual speed, whatever it is and at high altitude (some 30,000 feet as jets do my guess), and as the airplane passed at about 2 O'clock (I was facing North) a bright white object appeared from the North and moved really fast (4-5 times the relative speed of the moving airplane) in a North to South direction (perpendicular to the plane's route) but clearly at a much lower altitude (15 to 20 K feet) and in a horizontal, level trajectory, not a meteorite or at least not the way a meteorite behaves, no trail or debris at all as I have seen in the past many meteorites fall from the sky at night.  It was such a rare view that I actually tried following the object with my sight after it disappeared from view behind a tree.  Whatever it was it was bright white, not red like othe! r meteorites I've seen. and what surprised me was the straight line it followed as if in level flight.;34.5790359364198;-118.190248168623
