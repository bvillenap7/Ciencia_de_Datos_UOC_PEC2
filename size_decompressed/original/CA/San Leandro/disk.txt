It hoovered quickly and swift, colorful lights at bottom I was 17 years old, it was the summer of 1977. A male friend and I went over to Lake Chabot,it was late about 3:00 AM. We stood at the deck which overlooked the lake. Mountains surround the area and it is lit by the moonlight. It was very peaceful and pleasant, no one was out at this time of night. I remember feeling safe with guy friend, then suddenly from behind the mountain, a huge, maybe 100' wide flying saucer hovered into the valley like area, almost like it was hiding. It made a very swift humming sound and took over the sky. There were colorful lights twinkling on the bottom of the saucer. I was amazed, I looked over to my friend and he started running and left me there! I realized then how dark it was. The saucer had taken up the sky and the moonlight. I couldn't see the road which would lead me back up to the car. Oh my god, this guy left me! I said Wait!. Luckily, I found my way up the hill by memory, for have often visited Lake Chabot. There he was, my so called friend, taking off in his car. I was able catch him. He was very frighten, where I was more amazed. We went back to my house to share it with my roomate and she thought we were on drugs. Well, we weren't. We talked alone out in front of my house for a few miniutes, then he left. I haven't seen him since. I don't even remember his name. Hopefully, one day he will read this and want to contact me. If he is reading this, please place an add, do something, come find me. I would like to talk about that night, plus I will have proof, that I did see what I saw. I am not one to make up things, I have no reason to do this. I keep telling my children and family, Come on.... do you really think I would make something like this up and they say no, but find it hard to believe in UFOs. Well, that's my story and honest to God, I did see a flying saucer. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.7119697841727;-122.149330935252
Bright white disk, stationery for ten minutes, and then in an instant disappeared completely.;2002-10-12 11:00:00;10 minutes;Bright white disk, stationery for ten minutes, and then in an instant disappeared completely. I was at the San Leandro Marina and stopped walking to watch a FedEx plane land at nearby Oakland Airport.  Then my eye caught an extremely bright white disk across the San Francisco Bay.  It just hung in the sky for almot ten minutes, then lighted up to a brighter white glow.  Then in an instant disappeared.  Completely gone.  This should have been visible from the control towers at Oakland and San Francisco airports.  I don't know what it was, but it definitely was not an airplane or blimp.;37.7119697841727;-122.149330935252

We were driving by San Leandro California when my 13 year old son, screamed at me to look up at the sky, asking Mommy what is that???  first I did not where to look and he said on the sky.  I saw a saucer-like craft with lights at the bottom, drifting on the sky and heading down, intermitent lights were flashing on the bottom.   It looked like a hat.  The top of the craft was dark but the lights at the bottom were very bright.   I saw it for about a minute trying to figure out what it was, I could not make up what type of craft it was and I couldn't believe how much it looked like what I always  seen in pictures of UFOs.   Then all of the sudden I did not see it anymore.   My son said he was still able to see it a little longer after me.   My husband was driving so he could not turn his head to see.   As soon as we came home I told my son to run to go draw what he saw.  I also did the same.  Both of our pictures looked the same.  We both saw the same saucer-like spacecraft with flashing lights at the bottom. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information, so we were unable to request copies of the illustrations.

Two flat disk shaped long objects hovering in sky;2012-06-27 18:00:00;15 minutes;Two flat disk shaped long objects hovering in sky This happened back in late June of this year.  I am not sure off hand of the exact date but I know it was at the end of the month and on a Saturday early evening when it is still very light outside with daylight being summertime.  My husband who is an aviation engineer and I were both in front of our home.  My husband was near the side of the house shearing the shrubbery and I was sitting on the garden bench we have out front near the lawn with my dog.  I looked to my left past our neighbors house and I see two silver objects in the sky.  Both were the same shape, flattish, long and disk shaped.  This is not my first time seeing UFO objects and my husband being a skeptic, I decided to wait a few moments to see if they were just airplanes or whatnot. We do live below a flight path.  After approximately 2 minutes of these objects just sitting there, I then call to my husband and tell him to quickly come here. I point to them and he then sits at the curb in fro! nt of our home and tells me to get the binoculars.  I hurried inside and came right out with them.  He looks through the binoculars at them and by this time they have moved more to the right, one is higher than the other, and they are at a diagonal position one from the other.  He gives the binoculars to me and helps me to know just where I should hold them to see the objects.  What I saw was amazing as they looked to be spinning incredibly fast yet not moving.  Hard to explain, you would have to see them.  Also there seemed to be a red tinge at the bottom of both objects.  After looking what I felt to be long enough, I then give the binoculars back to my husband.  After looking for about another minute, he informs me that they both just disappeared.  He is skeptic.  I am not.  His explanation is that they are unlike anything that he has ever seen before.   This will sound unbelievable and strange, but I had a strong feeling that I would see a UFO four hours before.  And this had happened to me when I was younger.
