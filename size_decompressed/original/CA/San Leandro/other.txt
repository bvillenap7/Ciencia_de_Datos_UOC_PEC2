A quiet, dark and large floating arc moving from south to north towards downtown Oakland at 4:40 a.m.;2011-12-24 04:40:00;30 sec;A quiet, dark and large floating arc moving from south to north towards downtown Oakland at 4:40 a.m. I have a hot tub in my back yard and mostly use it very early in the morning between 4:30 a.m. and 6 a.m. - this morning (Saturday) I went out and as usual, I stare up into the sky hoping to see satellites go by (I usually see on or two) but this morning what I saw was dark against the sky, you could hardly see it but it was very large.  At first I thought it might be a hang-glider or a big kite.  It seemed to be a swept back arc with a darker front edge just floating north above Oakland towards Lake Merrit.  No lights, not fast moving.. balloon?  Giant Condor?  I could not of course tell how high it was, but I got the feeling it was a couple of thousand feet up.  Anything less would not explain the size of the thing.;37.7119697841727;-122.149330935252
I have seen some of the most activity in the night sky than I’ve ever observed before in my life.;2016-09-15 00:00:00;3 hours;I have seen some of the most activity in the night sky than I’ve ever observed before in my life. First it was black, shimmering black triangles, seemed to have some sort of cloak around it.  When the sun sets the cloak didn’t quite match the night sky, it gave a purplish cloud.  Then, started hearing what sounded like machines during the day. I now have seen what look to be stars detaching and traveling West, fading in and out.  I’ve seen what appears to be stars in a circle, it’s too many in such a small space.  They look to be activity moving within the circles. I’ve seen yellow orbs coming from the same direction and travel one at a time, so close that I feel an magnetic energy coming off of it in waves. Lastly, I’ve seen circular  objects, with lights red, white, around the middle traveling slowly along freeways, places are busy such as  pumpkin patch event that I attended.  I thought drones until one disappeared right over my head, again so close I could hear the humming of the quiet engine.;37.7119697841727;-122.149330935252
