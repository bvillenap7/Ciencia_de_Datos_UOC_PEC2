It was going straight headed north.  I ran in the house and said i saw a UFO my wife got off the couch and we ran to the front door.  I didnt see the triangle anymore. i looked hard tried to focus in the area.  I couldnt see it anymore. than some faint light very small and moving much faster than the triangle for a few seconds.  it got bright like a star in an instant it was gone. not sure of the time i was overwhelmed and still am. around 10:15 pm i have tried to write this so its legible.  that shit was cool.  i can basically draw this i have seen similiar images of these triangles and bursts on the web.;37.7119697841727;-122.149330935252
Five, non-blinking red lights in triangle or A configuration, East Bay Area.;2015-12-14 23:59:00;45 seconds;Five, non-blinking red lights in triangle or A configuration, East Bay Area. Monday night December 14th, I went out to check my car at midnight before going to bed. As the crow flies, I'm about a mile from the edge of the San Francisco Bay. If I look down my street in that direction, (west), I can see the big planes flying low, alongside the shoreline on their final approach to Oakland Airport. I also see the planes climbing out of Hayward Airport just to my south.  And I see the eastbound traffic from San Francisco International, straight across the bay from me.  So I'm familiar with air traffic and their procedures in this area. The ufo was about a mile and a half to the EAST, looking up the opposide direction of my street, which looks towards the Hayward hills.  The ufo was, from my perspective, slightly higher than the telephone pole at the end of the street. At first, I thought it was a large jet about to turn and head south to Fremont, where they make a u-turn onto the final approach to Oakland.  But the lights were all bright red.  And not blinking. I could only see the lights. I couldn't tell if they were part of one craft or five seperate, individual lights. It was the size of a 747 and in the shape of a capitol A or triangle, if you prefer.  One red light at the top.  One at each crosspiece and one at the bottom of each leg. It was flying towards me, but then unexpectantly stopped and held position.  Almost as though it know I was watching it. Then it began to fade, as though a wispy cloud passed in front.  But it was a cloudless sky.  Then it brightened again. Then faded once more. And then it completely winked out.  Gone, right before my eyes.  I waited for another five minutes, but it didn't reappear.;37.7119697841727;-122.149330935252
