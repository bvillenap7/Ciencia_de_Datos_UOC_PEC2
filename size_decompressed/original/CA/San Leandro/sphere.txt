Three orange spheres, one further ahead than the other two, all moving in a straight line at the same speed. The outlier sped up and moved straight upward in to the cloud cover.  The other two continued on their path, then the leader circled and took a left turn and disappeared.  The remaining sphere continued straight, stopped for a few seconds suspended, then went up in to the clouds and vanished.  There was no sound at all, which is how I knew they were not planes, as we walk there often on a path near the Oakland airport.  I am a local school teacher, my friend is an accountant and we are both graduate students.  We know with absolute certainty these were NOT planes, as we see and hear them fly over us all the time when we walk this path.;37.7119697841727;-122.149330935252
