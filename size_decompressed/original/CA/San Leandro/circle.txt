Wierd lights in the sky of the SF Bay.;2009-08-20 21:00:00;Hours;Wierd lights in the sky of the SF Bay. I'm an avid night watcher that has not seen much activity since hanging out with Ed Grimsley. But this week my friends mom, sister and niece reported strange lights in the night sky of our neighborhood for the last week or so. They stay out to watch it nightly till 1am. It was foggy in the SFBay last night so I waited until tonight. From San Leandro, CA looking in the direction of San Mateo (probably beyond)they called and said to look at the star in the sky. Upon further observation with the naked eye, I can confirm movement on behalf of the star. It has a light rotating around it and every now and again it would move in circles and other intelligent patterns. At times it will expand and grow faint for about 10 seconds and then reform itself into the red and white glistening star. It's pretty intersting.;37.7119697841727;-122.149330935252
