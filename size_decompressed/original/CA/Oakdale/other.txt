Small slow moving object that glowed bright white;2016-09-26 15:30:00;3 minutes;small slow moving object that glowed bright white September 26th, 2016, at approximately 3:30 pm  Today while I was sitting in my car, in front of my house and talking on the phone, I saw a white object that I first thought was a white napkin that the wind current must have picked up.  I observed this object move horizontally from 8 feet above my neighborâ€™s roof line to my home and across our roof, then back to about the middle of the roof, hover and then slowly move vertically away.   I continued watching the object for about 1 to 2 minutes until it was too far away to be visible which I approximate to be 1 to 1 1/2 mile or so away.  It became obvious to me as the object continued moving away, that it was not just white, but brightly glowing.;37.7725;-120.842
