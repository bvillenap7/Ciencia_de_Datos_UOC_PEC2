On 8/21/2015 at approximately 0530 I was driving to Oakdale, CA, and a noticed a circular craft hovering at a stand still at about 5,000 feet.   As I drove closer to the object, I got out of my car because I could not believe what I was seeing.  I could not hear any noise coming from the craft and it at 530 in the morning, it's extremely quiet.   I remember my mind was stuck at a daze just staring at the object, as if I was stuck when I was visualizing the object and I find that very odd and not normal for me.   The saucer shaped object took off diagonaly into the sky extremly fast and dipped down and shot back up into the sky and it was gone!  I could not belive what I had just witnessed.  We are definitely not alone in this universe.;37.7725;-120.842
