UFO over orange county california;2004-04-19 04:15:00;3 minutes;UFO over orange county california Saw the small sphere which appeared to be just over Garden Grove, then it slowly moved southeast towards what could be Santa Ana. What was odd was that there was no flashing lights or any lighting required by airplanes and hellicopters. The sphere had a soft amber light luminescence to it. In the end it headed east towards Cleveland national park then the sphere slowly faded away.  I ruled out a blimp as it was 4am in the morning and no attractions going on. It was not a hellicopter or plane for it had no flashing lights or blue or red of any kind. Planes only fly that low over orange county to land at John Wayne Airport. There is no such flight path as it headed east instead of south to Irvine. Most convincing was how it remained idle or barely moving for about a minute. At that moment anyone who would just glance at it would say its just a star, however, it resumed moving and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
