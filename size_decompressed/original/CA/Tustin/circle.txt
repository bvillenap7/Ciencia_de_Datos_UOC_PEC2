Large yellow & red lights on Red Hill Ave, going South towards Irvine Blvd. The lights simultaneous disappeared as I approached.;2009-08-23 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Large yellow & red lights on Red Hill Ave, going South towards Irvine Blvd. The lights simultaneous disappeared as I approached. I was driving on Red Hill Ave, going South. The road was very dark, and I was the only car in this stretch of road. It was between La Collina and Irvine Blvd at 10pm.  No street lights at all. In the distance I saw large yellow and red lights across the 4 lane highway. There were probably 10 lights on the pavement. It looked like a police barricade or road work. When I came closer, all the lights disappeared simultaneously. It was spooky. I mean they disappeared before my eyes. There was no one else on the road. I looked to see if the lights were there, but turned off, but nothing was there, only the street. I looked up at the buildings and there were no lights. I was freaked out because it was so odd. I have never seen anything disappear like that. They basically vanished into thin air.;33.7364840182647;-117.814321004566
Mini-Moon like light appeared and traveled partial across sky creating huge light path. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;5 minutes +;mini moon like light appeared and traveled partial across sky creating huge light path and left a huge green cloud before disappearing noticed a white round light appear in the sky.  I first thought it was the moon it was so bright.  I was on my patio and got up as my view was obscured by a tree.  I realized it was NOT the monn.  It was much smaller but just as bright as a full moon.  It appeared to travel in one direction then stop.  It created a huge beam of light that cast a huge V shaped beam behind it.  Then the light appeared to rotate and changed direction.  As it did the light beam began to recede and it appeared to leave a huge green cloud in its place.  This was viewed 20 minutes ago in the SW sky.  I'd guess it was 5+ miles out. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));33.7364840182647;-117.814321004566
Dark center, with a very bright glow around it slowly moving through the sky;2019-12-31 17:25:00;30 minutes;Dark center, with a very bright glow around it slowly moving through the sky Approximately 5:15 PM walking my dog, Walter, through a neighborhood park, I saw a bright light, too bright to be a star.  No flashing lights as is the case with standard aircraft.  The light would move very slowly, stop, then move again slowly.  I wouldn't of thought it any anything special, maybe a satellite, until I used my iphone 10 and zoomed in for a picture.  What I saw was a dark center, with a very bright glow around it.  I estimate the light somewhere over Newport Beach, CA, approximately 8 to 10 miles away.  45 minutes later, it is still in the sky.  I would expect you to also receive additional reports from this.;33.7364840182647;-117.814321004566
