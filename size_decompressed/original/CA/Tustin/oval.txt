A cluster of 11 silver ovals moved across sky near 5 Fwy in Tustin, CA on 6/14/21;2021-06-14 10:45:00;2 minutes;A cluster of 11 silver ovals moved across sky near 5 Fwy in Tustin, CA on 6/14/21 On June 14, 2021, at 10:45am, while drinking coffee with my sister outside a coffee shop in Tustin, CA, we noticed something odd in the sky. We hopped out of our chairs to get a closer look. What we thought were small drones heading our way ended up being 11 small oval-shaped silvery objects that moved eastward at a slow, carefree pace, just east of the 5 Fwy, near Newport Avenue and Main St. The objects stayed fairly close to each other, spreading out a little then coming back together. They appeared to have a shiny surface on one side, reflecting sunlight as they moved across the sky. Their movement was odd in that each object could move up, down, and side to side in different directions, while staying in a group, moving upward and eastward together. The total time we watched them was approximately 2-3 minutes. They flew up too high for us to see them after that time. ;33.7364840182647;-117.814321004566
