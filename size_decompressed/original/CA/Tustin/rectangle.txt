I was getting ready to pull into the driveway of the apartment complex and I was waiting for the gate to open.  The sun had set but it was still light out.  Above my 2-story apartment building, maybe 20 or so above, was an upright dark rectangular object.  It's front was ringed with two rows of square lights.  The outer ring of lights was turned to look like diamonds.  One ring was white and one red.  It was about 20 feet tall and the central core was inset several feet like a doorway or a hatch.  It stopped at the edge of the top of the building, hovered and then the rings of lights pulsed and it continued moving east at what seemed like 10 mph.  It made no sound.;33.7364840182647;-117.814321004566
