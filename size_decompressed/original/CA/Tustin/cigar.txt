Silver cigar shaped stationary UFO.;2017-10-22 15:00:00;30 minutes;Silver cigar shaped stationary UFO. On Sunday, 10/22, (last Sunday) at about 3 p.m., three of us saw a very strange object in the sky.   Comparing it to cigar shaped UFO sitings online, it's the only thing we came up with.   We watched it ...  it was not moving like a plane or balloon, but was stationary, and would only turn.... it was so distant, that you would only see it when the sun reflected off it.  It was silver.  I took some photos with a 500 mm lens and then enlarged them.;33.7364840182647;-117.814321004566
