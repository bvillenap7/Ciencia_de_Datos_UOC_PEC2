Colors of lights under craft changing from dim to bright,right to left,left to right.Hovering,colors of the lights were red, orange, white.Before all of this though, my wife and I left to south O.C. we were looking at what apeared to be a rocket of some sort.It was very high in the sky almost looking like it was going straight up, but it was acutually traveling towards Los Angeles.I thougt it was a airplane at high alt.It struck me very odd.I'd seen rocket once before and this did not look like what i had seen in the past.  Anyway hour later coming back from friends , we seen this large object 20 miles away I would say, hovering uliminating these colors in no order.  We can not believe what we just experienced.  We just hope there are other people who saw it also ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.7364840182647;-117.814321004566
