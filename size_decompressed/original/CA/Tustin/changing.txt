I was taking a walk this morning in my neighborhood.   As I turned a corner, I looked up in the sky and saw a small black object floating slowly through the air.   It was difficult to get an idea of the distance but it seemd to be a few hundred feet high.   At first I thought it was a small balloon that someone had let go because it was coming from the direction of an elementary school by my house.   But as I got closer to it, it stopped floating and I could see that it was rotating in place.   As it rotated, the shape changed from a disc type shape, to a sphere and occasionally I saw some lights appear, sort of like two headlights.   It was truly unbelievable, but I stood there and watched it for several minutes and then it very suddenly dissappeared.   AMAZING!;33.7364840182647;-117.814321004566
