It flew level accross the horizon from west to east. At the very end of the flight it split into 2 additional smaller pieces in front of the main light trail. The two additional pieces did not have trails. The pieces and the original light continued in a straight line on the original trajectory. The lights then all went out simultaneously. It was NOT a meteor or a comet. It appeared to about 1000 feet off the ground. My original summary describes what I saw. I can only add that I have seen comets, meteors and enough planes in my life to know that It was not any of those things. I immediately contacted NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena and they had no clue what it was but said that they had gotten many calls. I could not tell what the shape of the object was or how large it was.;33.7364840182647;-117.814321004566
Two bright white lights that appeared and disappeared;2003-08-17 20:55:00;15 seconds;Two bright white lights that appeared and disappeared We were lying on a raft in our pool looking up at the stars and out of nowhere two light appeared. They were equally spaced and were very bright white and they seemed to be coming towards us and then they just went out as fast as they appeared. It scared the heck out of me! We live close to an airport so were are familar with airplane lights and this was no airplane.  My husband and I are normal people with no UFO sightings before. I have always been curious and tonight I am a believer!;33.7364840182647;-117.814321004566
5 bright lights in a strange formation.;2012-05-12 21:10:00;2 minutes on film;5 bright lights in a strange formation. I only saw the video of this right after my husband recorded it. He noticed 4 or 5 bright lights in the sky, in a strange formation, so he ran back into the house to get his camera phone and recorded it. You can VERY clearly see distinct red-ish lights in the sky, in a very unique pattern. They're in the shape of a diagonal line. My husband said they were blinking at times, but that's not clear on the video. Eventually, they completey disappeared in the blink of an eye. We've never seen anything like this EVER. I'm shaking as I type this!;33.7364840182647;-117.814321004566
