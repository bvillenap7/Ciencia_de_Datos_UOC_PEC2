Woodland Hills, Los Angeles Shinning craft at midday.;1998-04-11 11:00:00;20mins;((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  Date is approximate.  PD)) Woodland Hills, Los Angeles Shinning craft at midday. I was sun bathing at the pool in L.A fittness.  I decided to look up at the sky and block the sun out of my view to see if the theory of being able to see things in the sky was true, as i had just seen a story on doing that on a T.V show called Sightings.  To my absoute surprise i did.  It was a very bright shining and pulsating object that appeared to shimmer.  I was much more silver than the sun itself, which seemed to be yellow in comparison.  This was a strange thing to see since i had a very memorable dream about meeting with aliens only a few days earlier.  In the dream they took me around the USA and showed me where they had bases, the strange thing was though, they all looked the same, and to me in my dream they looked like businessmen in suits.  I was wondering if i could communicate with the people flying it, this just came to me, so i asked them in my mind to fly in such a way that i could prove to myself that they were not an earthly aircraft.  In about 10 seconds it begen to fly in tight circles at an incredible speed, this clearly could not be a plane, helicopter, balloon or satilite.  When it finished, i heard in my head... there you go. I was impressed beyond belief! I was in the presence of other people at the tiime and could not understand why they didn't look up to see what it was i was looking at so intently, it seemed that they didn't even notice me.  I felt the need to tell someone so i could get a second witness, however when i had that thought...I heard, or felt a thought that i should not do this and that this experience was a GIFT TO ME, so i din't tell anyone there at the time.  As i indicated this went on for 20 minutes.  The vehicle flew all over the sky at incredible rates of speed, covering an entire two thirds of the horizon in a few seconds, it was uplifting and joyful to watch, i had such a feeling of overwhelming wellbeing within me. At the end, after the spinning circles, they indicated that they needed to leave as they were being tracked, even though i never saw! any pla nes up there, and it took off to the west, out over the Pacific so fast that i don't know if it disappeared or left my view.  I have seen many lights in the sky and have had numerous strange experiences throughout my childhood in Australia, along with psychic events all my life, but this was the clearest i have ever seen in daylight.;34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226
Hovering, erratic green light appears for more than one hour in the Southern California sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD));2004-04-26 21:30:00;over 1 hour;Hovering, erratic green light appears for more than one hour in the Southern California sky. Noticed green light hovering in sky in the northwest, (i.e., approx. 315 degree compass heading).  Light was approx 15-20 degrees above the horizon.  Light was magnitude of an average star.  Conditions were extremely clear as the area was experiencing Santa Ana conditions, record high temps for the date.  Light displayed erratic motion, moved from side to side, right angle moves, etc.  Light displayed a slight flicker, but this certainly could be due to atmospheric conditions.  Total field covered by the moving light was approx. 5 degrees in any direction.  The light was also viewed by a witness whom I notified via cell phone, approx. 15 miles to the south of my position.  This indicates to me that the source of light was extremely far away.  I attempted to have an additional witness view the light from San Diego, (approx. 120 miles to the south), but was unsuccessful.  I first viewed the light at approx. 8:55PM, sighting lasted to approx. 10:15PM  I did not notice any change in the pattern of commercial jet activity (flight approaches coincided with the general vicinity of the light) during the entire time of the light display. ((NUFORC Note:  Our first suspicion is that the light might have been a celestial body, probably Venus, which is in the northwestern sky, at the angle of elevation indicated by the witness.  We will suggest that he look again in the same area of the sky, at about the same time, on August 27, to see if the object is visible again.  PD));34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226
Bright, stationary object next to the moon, gone the next day.;2010-08-30 02:00:00;2 consecutive nights;Bright, stationary object next to the moon, gone the next day. I am an 18 year old male. It was late at night about a week ago and I was looking up towards the moon. Directly to the left of the moon was an unusual light.  It somewhat resembled a star at first, but then it became clear that it was giving off both blue and red light, and also had a shaft of light on the front of it, which distorted its twinkling, and made it look more unusual.  I watched the object for several minutes, wondering what it was. It stayed stationary the whole time, and eventually I went to bed.   This object was very bright and memorable. I witnessed a similar object the next night, elsewhere in the sky. Once again I observed it for several minutes and it stayed stationary.  These objects are no longer in the sky.  The moon offered a great reference point for the first one I saw, since it was so close to the left of the moon, and it is obvious that whatever it was is now gone.  Thatâ€™s all there was to it!;34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226
Three bright stationary orbs seen from Topanga, above the hills towards Santa Clarita.;2014-10-05 20:00:00;5 minutes;Three bright stationary orbs seen from Topanga, above the hills towards Santa Clarita. We were driving through Topanga Canyon from the ocean towards Woodland HIlls.  We saw three stationary extremely bright lights in the sky, in a large triangular formation  Seemed to be the same distance apart.  They were cutting through a fairly dense fog.  The point of the triangle was at the highest point, and were too high to be in the mountains., but rather appeared to be hovering above the mountains.   When we came around a curve, they had disappeared.   They seemed to be in the direction of Santa Clarita. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
