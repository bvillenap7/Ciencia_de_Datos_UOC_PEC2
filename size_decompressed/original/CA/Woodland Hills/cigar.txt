Daylight Cigar / Cylinder Shape Flying Object;2008-09-10 09:50:00;5 seconds;Daylight Cigar / Cylinder Shape Flying Object Driving northbound 101 near the Tampa Ave exit in the San Fernando Valley at approx. 9:50 AM, I saw a very bright, cylindrical object in the sky. The object looked similar to the body of a 747 without the tail or wings. However, it was the size of the object that caught my attention. Living near the Burbank Airport, I see many planes from varying distances. For the distance this object seemed to be, it was much larger than a 747, about 80% longer and 40% wider, again with no wings or tail. The object was very shiny & metallic in comparison to typical aircraft. It appeared to be cylindrical due to the shadow and shading that implied a curvature of a cigar-shape. I watched it fly horizontally into light clouds. At this time, I had slowed down to watch the object pass and waited for it to exit through the clouds, which were sparse. I did not see it emerge. Given the time I saw it traveling, the object would have appeared relatively quickly from the cloud. As I was driving northbound and the object was ahead of me at about 1 o'clock, I had time to check the cloud as I approached and passed it. From the angles that I had, I never saw it again.;34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226
White cigar shape at high altitude came to a stop and dissolved into thin air.;2014-08-27 16:00:00;12 seconds;White cigar shape at high altitude came to a stop and dissolved into thin air. I was swimming in the pool, then while in the water I looked up into a very clear blue sky.  I noticed that there was no air traffic in the area.   After a minute or two I spotted a white shape moving slowly, possibly cigar shaped.  I watched carefully as it moved in an Eastward direction, slowed and came to a stop and appeared dissolved into then air, in the matter of a few seconds.   The entire sighting lasted about 15 seconds.   After about a minute or two of vanishing from sight a couple of regular airplanes flew approximately in the same location at various altitudes, which gave me a very good reference as to the difference in the esthetic of what I was seeing.;34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226
