Amber objects performing high speed maneuvers overing;2006-02-13 17:15:00;8-10 mins;Amber objects performing high speed maneuvers overing Tuesday February 13th, 2007.  My vantage point was from outside my office in Woodland Hills, CA.  I noticed a large (747) FedEx jet flying over my office and I thought it was strange for such a large jet to be headed towards Burbank Airport, as this airfield is generally for smaller commercial aircraft. As I watched to see if the plane would turn into the landing pattern for Burbank Airport, I noticed a bright point of light in the cloud directly behind the FedEx jet.  At first I only saw one object then I noticed there were at least 2 others. The lights I saw were an amber color. Almost as if the object was reflecting the setting sun to the west. I believe I saw 3 distinct objects.  But they were only visible as a group for a short period of time.  Each point of light would vary in intensity.  From very bright (they seemed to expand as the light got brighter), to barely visible.  The lights had to be quite bright because the objects were clearly visible while being either in the cloud or behind it. And the cloud itself was rather dark. Now, these lights were moving in some rather strange patterns.  I would describe the flight patterns as parabolic.  They would move in one direction and perform what I would describe as a 'U-turn' and move back in the other direction.  These 'U-turns' were executed at a high rate of speed.  At one point I saw multiple lights performing these maneuvers. It resembled two squirrels chasing each other around and up a tree. At one point one of the lights was performing the parabolic maneuver (on an off axis) and it stopped in its tracks.  It hovered in that position for roughly 10 seconds.  Then without a noticeable acceleration period, continued the maneuver at the same high rate of speed. All of the movement I witnessed was at a relatively high rate of speed.  I would estimate the altitude to be about 10,000-15,000 feet and the distance from myself to the objects at about 20 miles.  I have never seen an object in the air travel this fast or maneuver like these objects did. At no time were these objects visible outside the the cloud that was moving past. The whole episode lasted 8-10 minutes.  At which point the cloud had changed its shape and had moved off into the distance and the objects were no longer appearing.;34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226

Very slow, maybe about 25mph and at about two thousand feet above ground altitude. They both maintained a fixed distance from each other as they moved and going in the same direction. Sid not speed up or slow down during the minute or two during the observation. These were not drones, fixed wing aircraft, balloons, or helicopters. They looked like two golf balls flying in formation.;34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226
Steeply ascending small round object with trail separated from it and moved chaotically then disappeared and reappeared.;2021-06-03 20:02:00;one minute;Steeply ascending small round object with trail separated from it and moved chaotically then disappeared and reappeared. I thought I was looking at a narrow little cloud in the sky from our deck then noticed it had a small round object at its left side - and I realized the cloud wasn't a cloud but perhaps a white trail from this object that was ascending at a very steep angle - that's when I grabbed my iPhone and began recording the video - the object was white and then separated from the trail and then moved vertically and then quickly moved to right and then both the object and the trail abruptly disappeared. Within seconds my other witness noticed the round white object high in the sky to the right of our house staying static for a few seconds and then I also saw it when it began moving in a chaotic pattern for a couple of seconds and then it disappeared. Unfortunately, it happened so fast I was unable to begin shooting another video of it. The area it reappeared in was the eastern sky and its first appearance was in the southwestern sky. Because the object and the trail di! sappeared at same time and then object reappearing in a completely different location I do not believe this could in any way be a satellite or rocket, etc.;34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226
