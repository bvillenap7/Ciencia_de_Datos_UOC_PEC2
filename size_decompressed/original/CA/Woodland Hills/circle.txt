Large white blinking stationary circle west of Los Angeles 2003;2003-09-01 22:15:00;<2 minutes;Large white blinking stationary circle west of Los Angeles 2003 I was at my workplace, on a second floor balcony looking toward the western sky.  I saw what i thought was a bright white  star, but it became larger and within 30 seconds grew to the size of a full moon, but brighter, all the while remaining still and completely quiet.  The object, still a large perfect circle, proceeded to blink on and off approximately 5 times.    Startled, i ran downstairs to bring my colleagues, but by the time they reached the balcony, the light was completely gone.   If this was not an alien craft, i was thinking, could it have been an extremely distant gamma ray burst that I witnessed?;34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226

I was out on the balcony of my apartment when I saw an odd cirle in the sky. I turned to look at it and realized what it was. I called out my roomates and three of them came along with one of the staff members for our program. We proceeded to watch it for an additional 30 to 40 seconds till it litterally disappeared.;34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226
Two lights over Hidden Hills, hovering.;2016-02-04 18:15:00;10 minutes;Two lights over Hidden Hills, hovering. 2/4/2016  Time was 6:15 Pm to 6:45 Pm.  I was driving in my car on Valley Circle, moving south towards the Ventura Freeway.  I looked up over Hidden Hills due west and saw two UFOs.  Both forms were two balls of light glowing.  Hovering close together then apart.  One slowly branched off south east.  The other stayed.   I had come to a stop light as I watched.  As the stop light changed green I realized I was on the other side of town going the opposite direction.   I am overwhelmed by this experience.  I lost about 10 minutes of time.   I did see a light descending on the hill due south as I was driving due east.;34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226
