Saw a black saucer like object fly out of the Woodland Hills, CA area south of Ventura Boulevard.;2006-06-30 13:00:00;5 minutes;Saw a black saucer like object fly out of the Woodland Hills, CA area south of Ventura Boulevard. I’m not sure what year this happened.  I was surprised by the event and have not reported it until now.  Not sure if this will be helpful at all, but here goes.  I know it was after the year 2003 and before the year 2008.  I was in the parking lot of the shopping mall at Ventura Blvd. and Topanga Canyon.  I was in my car in front of the then PetSmart.  My car was oriented towards the south so I was looking at the hills just south of Ventura Blvd. around Mulholland.  I saw what seemed to be a small black saucer shaped object rise up out of the neighborhood south of Ventura Blvd.  I couldn’t believe my eyes as I watched this object rise quickly into the sky.  I wanted to grab my cell phone and take a picture, but I didn’t want to take my eyes off the object for fear of losing it.  It was a bright blue skied afternoon with a few white fluffy clouds.  I watched intently and looked around a bit to see if anyone else was noticing and saw no one, just a parking a lot with cars.  I kept my eye on the object trying to figure out if it was a balloon or what.  It did not look like a balloon.  It quickly rose and then I could see it way up and glistening against a cloud.  The western sun must have caught it and it was shining now, not black.  That is it.  I have never even told any friends about this.  I don’t know what I saw, but it was surely strange and seemed to be what I have heard others describe. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
