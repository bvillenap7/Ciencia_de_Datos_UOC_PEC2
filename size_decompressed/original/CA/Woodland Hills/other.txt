I read it at http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28596.html.  I remember i saw two CH-47 Chinook fly low while i walk to my apt from Vons grocery. Two CH-47 toward over hills in Calabasas to look for something then disappear. I suspect they were on way to Point Mugu Air Station, CA or Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA. I don't see UFO or sighting in sky near Woodland Hills-Calabasas bounty.;34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226
