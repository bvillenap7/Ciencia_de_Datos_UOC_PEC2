Possible UFO seen in CA;2011-05-03 21:16:00;1 minute;Possible UFO seen in CA 9:16pm 5.03.2011 I went outside to smoke a cigarette and as soon as I stepped outside my back door I saw a bright light up near the big dipper.  It wasn’t flashing, and you could tell it was very high up in the sky.  It glided across the sky, and there was no sound like the usual sound you hear when an airplane goes by. It glided, and yet you could tell that it was not anything like a plane.  I followed the light, since I thought that it looked very interesting. I watched it for about a minute, and then it just disappeared! It completely disappeared!!!   About 10 minutes after that, an airplane landed at Burbank Airport, then a minute later another airplane landed. After about 20 minutes, a total of 15 airplanes landed at Burbank airport.  That’s a lot of airplanes to land within such a short amount of time!!  I went back inside grabbed a cigarette, and I went outside and watched the sky.  Another 3 airplanes landed, and then high above my head, really, really high up I noticed a stationary star th! at seemed to get brighter.  I watched the star until I noticed that it too was moving and at a very fast rate.  It went halfway across the sky, until it completely disappeared.;34.1681869080777;-118.606922841226
