I'm 47 years old and have an MA in Interdisiplinary Studies at Cal State University.  I'm a 6 year U.S. Air Force Law Enforcement vet (1974-1980) and have been an Archaeologist and Techinician in CA and NV since 1991.  While camping at Don Pedro Reservoir, at the mouth of the Toulumne River, on Wards Ferry Road I witnessed the following:  The day was Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2003 at approximately 2300 hrs., the sky was clear.  Curious if any info. on a single, round, white light object that quickly approached and tail-gated an airliner heading west toward San Francisco (?).  The object (about 1/4 size or smaller than the airliner) followed the plane for a few seconds then made a very abrubt 180 degree U-turn to the left and headed east (up the Toulumne River Canyon).  I flashed my headlights at it a couple of times as it headed back in my direction (this area is fairly remote).  The object suddenly made an abrubt left turn (north) in front of me and disappeared over the mountain from my view.  It appeared to maintain the same altitude throught the flight and only slowed when it approached the plane and when I flashed my headlights at it. I felt very concerned for the passengers on the flight and eventually made this report to the FAA at Rancho Murieta and Sacramento approximately one week after the sighting.  I got a negative response from both.    Sincerely,  ((initials deleted));37.9689;-120.2361
Fast moving light object.;2012-12-19 02:00:00;5 hours;fast moving light object. one was hovering in on spot. It was a light, a blinking light, like a twinkling star. It would hover there, but while it was hovering it would move very fast in different directions.;37.9689;-120.2361
