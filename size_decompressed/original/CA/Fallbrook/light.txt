Driving South along Interstate 15;2000-06-27 21:30:00;35;Driving South along Interstate 15 My Fiance and I were returning home from moving my things from Chino and we were driving South on I15 I looked up to the night sky to see the stars that were very bright during this particular stretch of freeway. While looking up, I noticed a light travelling across the sky at a stedy pace. I tried to point it out to her, but she said she couldn't look because she was driving. It was the size of a star moving North at a stady rate of speed.I thought it was a plane at first, but half way across the sky it faded out.Maybe it was a satellite.;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882

When it finally got close enought the first object, it made a 90 degree turn, and just took off to the south and was gone in a blink of a eye. Then the second fighter turned a round and headed back towards Mirimar Base. I have never seen an object change direction and have a speed well over any thing we have, I would guess it would have gone at a speed of 5000 miles an hour, it was gone out of sight in a less than a tenth of a second, I just got a glimpse it's speed out of the corner of my eye.  The strange thing we rarely ever have any military fighers fly over, and not at low altitude probably under 20,000 feet and none have ever kicked in their after burners.;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882

I witnessed a bright white light moving passed other stars.  It was just as big as another star.  The only difference is that it did not flicker like a star.  I was the first to witness this, then my brother and finally my dad.  I lost contact when i got my dad to see it.  They say it zig zagged and was changing colors to a brilliant green and pink.  I didnt see it after i got my dad outside, but they both saw it.  We left because it was too cold.  This was witnessed when i stepped outside my porch to look at the stars looking for ufo's.  I should have at least taped this, but i guess i was too excited at the time...;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882
yellow flashing lights from behind the hills;2006-04-23 02:00:00;2 minutes;yellow flashing lights from behind the hills I was driving on highway 76 around 2:00 AM. I remember that there was not many cars at the time. I had just passed the Pala Casino Resort, and as i was driving i looked up in the sky to the see the stars, There were many hills at this location, and very quickly did this happen, but i saw a wierd looking object that came out from behind the hills, as i took a closer look, i saw that there were many attractive lights. It looked liked it was gaining altitude during the time that it was visible. yellow lights flashed annoyingly, and it was extremely distracting. In the middle was a red light that just shined almost like a lazer. within two minutes it had been gone.;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882

Cluster of bright lights moving erratically in San DIego County.;2014-07-05 23:25:00;5 minutes;Cluster of bright lights moving erratically in San DIego County. Driving south on the I-15 Freeway just south of Temecula and Fallbrook, CA, approaching the Highway 76 exit.  My husband and I had just entered unincorporated San Diego County when from the car we saw an unidentifiable object in the low sky on the east side of the freeway. We saw a cluster of between three to five very bright white lights.  The cluster formed a sort of circle, but it changed formation.  The cluster flew erratically over an area relatively low to the ground—this was an area of undeveloped land for the most part.  It would move around, dip down towards the ground, then move upward very fast, then move around again in a formation, kind of dipping and shooting up and making sudden turns, all fairly low to the ground in ways that no plane or helicopter or other flying thing I know of could do.  Certainly nothing of this size. The lights on this were incredibly bright.  My husband asked if we should turn around at the 76 exit and go back to try and see it again once we passed it.  I didn’t think I could take a picture of it since it was moving so fast and erratically.  My husband said it must be a drone.  I went home and read about drones and none were described like this. My husband is a lawyer and I have a Ph.D. in education.  We have no particular interest in UFO’s.  We did see the hovering amber lights over Orange County from our home in Dana Point earlier this year, but didn’t think to report it.  This sighting was, to me, much more unsettling;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882
