white marbell shaped object;2003-04-26 15:30:00;15 min;white marbell shaped object I was lying down in my front yard looking up when I saw a very thin white object suspended in the air. I watched it for a few minutes, then went into the house to get my binoculars.  With the binoculars I could clearly see the shape, it resembled a white to bright silver barbell or capital I. I watched for few more munutes, it apeared to be moving slowly to the east as I heard the sound of  military fighter getting louder then it vanished. I observed the jet, it was larger than a fighter, and it looked as if it going to the spot where the object was. The object was fairly large, because it was a fair distance away. I obseved this object for 8-10 minutes.;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882
