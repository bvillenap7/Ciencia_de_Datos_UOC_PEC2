There were 4 glowing objects, large orange glowing balls that were visable over the field in front of my home.   The dogs were barking outside.   I ran to wake my husband but by the time he responded they were gone.;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882

I had just gotten into bed and just turned on my side looking out window.  I saw a very orange fireball, then it blew-up.  Everything was very fast.    I thought a plane exploded but there was nothing falling it just went dark like the sky.  It was a distance away but it was bigger then a plane would be at that distance.  I was struck by the vibrant color.   There was a little yellow around it as it seemed to explode.  No sound. Retired real estate agent.;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882
