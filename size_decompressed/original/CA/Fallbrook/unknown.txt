Saw something that looked like a flare starting from the ground to the air and then it started moving SE.  ((Missile launch.  PD));2017-12-22 17:38:00;15 minutes;We saw something that looked like a flare starting from the ground to the air and then it started moving southeast. A bright light with a significantly large trail of vapor/smoke that covered a large part of the sky. It split in two with two very bright lights with their own vapor trails. The second one was emitting circular waves before it slowly descended towards the ground. While the main light continued to the southeast  before disappearing into the distance. While in full display the sky was lit up like the shape of a large whale with a very long and exceptionally bright trail of vapor/smoke. We have videos.  Swear to goodness, it was REALLY weird. Saw two moving lights emitting flash of light like oval torch. ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Vandenberg AFB @ 5:26 p.m..  PD));33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882
