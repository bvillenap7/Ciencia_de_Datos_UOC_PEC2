I was walking along the path that leads through our avocado grove, on my way to the mailbox, located less than a quarter mile from my house.  I heard, what I thought, was a small plane over me.  I looked up.  It was a V or boomerang shaped craft.  It was not a triangle.  Take a V and spread it apart. I stood gazing up as it flew at low altitude, directly over me and down the path that I was walking.  It seemed to be a bit smaller than a 747, yet it sounded more like a small plane.  It was going slow enough, so that I was able to study it and remember what it looked like. It was dull silver metal, like an ordinary plane.  There were no markings whatsoever.  It was perfectly smooth with no projections such as a tail, or point or anything at all.  There were no propellers.  There was a single white flashing light at the end of each wing span.  There were two small yellow objects more toward the center.  Maybe they were additional lights, but they were not on. In the past week, I have scoured the Internet and books, and have not been able to locate this craft.  It is not a Stealth.  It almost looked like a Northrop YB-49, but no propellers and very smooth. I have no memory of watching it fly away or what happened to it.  I studied it intensely as it flew directly over me. Fallbrook California is situated between Camp Pendleton and Miramar.  There seemed to be more than usual helicopter activity in the area for the next few days. My background: father in the military. Grew up partly overseas and military bases.

Square flying object w/white lights on corners, red light on sides, white in center. Another had one BIG red light and moved VERYY fast;2009-06-09 22:00:00;10 minutes, on and off;Square flying object w/white lights on corners, red light on sides, white in center. Another had one BIG red light and moved VERYY fast I was in my room watching TV, then all of a sudden, I couldn't even hear my show anymore because there was this loud, high pitched humming or whistling sound. So I run to my window and look outside... there's a huge square pattern of lights, with a flashing red one that would flash on one side, then a white one would flash in the middle. So Iâ€™m freaking out running outside and staring at it. When I look again, there's another light, moving SO fast, straight towards the square one. Just when i think they're going to hit, one moves down and the other moves up, then they continue to circle around the Fallbrook/Oceanside area. There was another one that was also circling that SOUNDEDD like a helicopter, but i knew it couldn't be because of its speed. And especially as it got further away, it was moving way faster than even a jet looks like it's moving, into the same general area that the other two went to. This happened three times. Unfortunately I couldn't find a camera in time to get a picture, but on the last round... SO FAR... i almost did but it was too far away. But when I did research on s square air craft... there was no government air craft that was square with lights like this one had. Then results came up as UFOs so I had to say SOMETHING.;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882
