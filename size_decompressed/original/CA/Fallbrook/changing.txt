Huge bright liigt;2005-05-01 16:11:00;30 sec;Huge bright liigt I was  planting in my yard, when I looked up saw what was a white object shape liked barbell, it was about 15000-20000 feet up no noise moving a very slow speed for a large object.  I kept watching it seemed to become a very very bright light almost a bright silver bigger than the object was before, as it changed shape it seemed to just vanish. It seemed like it didn't disturb the air around it no sound  at all.  First thing I thought thatit was a refection off the craft from the sun, but it had the sun behind it with no ability to reflect my direction.  Two years ago in april I saw the same type of craft in the same area that was just floating, until a military jet aproached then it just vanished!;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882
