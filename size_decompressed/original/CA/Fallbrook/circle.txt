As if I were seen,it took off in a straight line about 3in, toward the West, before I lost sight of it because of clouds or surroundings, I don't know which.  I estimate the size to be that of a large airliner at 25,000 ft.,or the size of a dime,from the distance of 8 ft.  The objects luminecents got darker in the center of the object. The sighting only lasted a half second. There was no sound at all during the sighting that I could remember.;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882
Orb that popped in and out of the atmosphere twice;2009-02-24 02:00:00;3:00;Orb that popped in and out of the atmosphere twice I was driving down highway 76, when I saw a slow moving object.  It was very bright and the color was a reddish, brown solid color.  I didn't know what to make of it.  So I shined my powerful mag lite at the orb, when all of a sudden it released a cloud of white smoke.  There was no moon out, but the cloud was very bright, after two minutes it went out of the atmosphere, and then it popped back in again, and started to show more smoke like cloud.  The clouds were small and lingered for about ten minutes after it vanished.  It almost reminded my of a comet entering our atmosphere, but it popped in and out twice, I grabbed its attention after the second pop in.  Cause my flash light was on it and it traveled very slowly then it left. no strobing light and it was far enough to remind me of a star, that left a cloud in the ozone.I was the only one who saw it and I was to nervous to take a picture.;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882

Orange orb with some intelligence.;2014-02-18 23:20:00;4 minutes;Orange orb with some intelligance I'm a licensed guard working at night, driving thru a gated community.  When facing west and looking up, I noticed a orange sphere in the sky.  It looked like it was 400 ft. up.  I shined my bright flash light on it and it slowed down and bobbed up and down.  Then I grabbed my cell phone to record the scene, but in my panic I forgot to push play. The strangest thing, it looked to be intelligent, because it slowed down behind the tree tops to where it stayed at of my site.   I walked a few steps to get a view of the orb and it vanished to the clouds.;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882
