A gunmetal colored suacer shaped vehicle;2003-05-27 14:14:00;1min;A gunmetal colored suacer shaped vehicle On a Sunny afternoon of June the 27th when a was waching a TV show in my room and noticed a bright falsh. When I peered out of my window I noticed a Suacer shaped vehicle about 200 to 300 yrds away. At first it reflected the sun lite, then I noticed it was gunmetal colored. Shocked at what I saw I rushed for my binoculers. I watched it slowly pass the sky going west to east. It then speeded up and shot out of sight going north east I'd say at about 1,000 mph.;33.3683441176471;-117.233477205882
