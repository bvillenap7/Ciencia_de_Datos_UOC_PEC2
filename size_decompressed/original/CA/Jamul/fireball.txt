I heard my aunt marry scream out to my uncle ((name deleted)),  there is a bright light come look. My uncle then quickly asked her to come into the house, by then all of us kids were at the door , looking ,  my uncle told us to go to the back bedroom, get onto the bed and look out the window. We did just that , we continued to ask our uncle what he thought it was, he said that he was sure it was a ufo, then we got more excited! For this was my first time I have ever experienced such a thing! I will never, ever forget it till the day i die, and will always remind my cousins of it so they will never forget after I am gone. It was glowing bright orange, and moving in such a way no other aircraft could keep up, it was like, to travel from stop to stop or triangle to triangle , or tip to tip, it takes a hilocopter time to stop in mid air and this did too! and it would speed up far faster than any jet in this world! I can't explain it other than that but will never forget , ever! I atest to this here and now, ((name deleted));32.7167;-116.8323
Fireball shot through skin then disappeared, triangular object with lights flashingshot and then disappeared.;2014-07-21 23:13:00;3 minutes;Fireball shot through skin then disappeared, triangular object with lights flashingshot and then disappeared. Over the mountains in Jamul, I saw what appeared to be a shooting star, only it was bright orange, and then turned into a fireball and exploded then totally disappeared.  There was no sound.  It lasted maybe 3 seconds this occured around 11:13 pm on 7-21-14.   Then seconds later, to the right of where the fireball was, I saw what appeared to be a circular object just hovering.  It was bright white light with red on the left side and blue on the right side, the flashing bright white light in the middle was pulsating.  It hovered for at least a minute then suddenly shot across the sky so fast I barely saw it move, it was HERE then THERE, then it disappeared.   This occured around 11:15 pm on 7-21-14.;32.7167;-116.8323
