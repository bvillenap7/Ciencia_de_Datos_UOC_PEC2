Double flash of satellite moving North to South  ???;2010-07-09 22:00:00;1 minute;Double flash of satellite moving North to South  ??? While in my back yard, letting my dog out, on a particularly clear/starry night, I looked up into the night sky overhead & witnessed a small, white pinpoint dot of light that traveled North to South.  Believing it was a satellite, but intrigued by it’s North to South speedy movement (I am used to satellites being seen moving West to East), I continued to watch. As if it knew I was watching, it flashed bright white, then dimmed and within a few seconds flashed the same bright, white light and then dimmed almost completely out.   It never repeated the flash.   Within approx. 1-minute of this event, overhead I spotted a satellite that traveled very slowly from East to West. I have never seen a Satellite flash…let alone so bright and then repeat!  I imagine these were both satellites, but I consider their strange paths and flashes to be noteworthy.  Were they satellites?? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.6209;-120.1922
