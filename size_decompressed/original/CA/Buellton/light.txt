Larger than Venus with Distinct color changes;2011-04-04 23:27:00;Unknown;Larger than Venus with Distinct color changes I went outside to take the trash down to the curb around 11:27 am.  It was a very clear night, no cloud cover, a bit crisp.  Great visability.  I noticed right away, separate from the other star formations, what appeared to be a rapidly color-changing ball of light, distinctly different from the normal twinkling colors of most stars.  These were visible colors not just vague pastel flashes like most stars.  The light was single, about 70-degrees above the horizon and exactly southwest of my location (I confirmed this with my iphone compass).  The light was larger and brighter than Venus (as a reference), and as mentioned, changed into separate and very distinct colors:  red, green, blue, white, yellowish.  No particular order to the color changes.  No sounds overheard.   I watched for several minutes and even tried to take a video with my phone.  However, the darkness surrounding me proved too great for the video, and the light did not show up, nor did anything else except a street lamp, on the video.   No aircraft flying in the sky at this moment, although Vandenberg is about 20-minutes away and due west from my location.   I am a college-educated, medical professional. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the witness, to inquire whether the object might have been a twinkling star, possibly Sirius.  She is planning to check that possibility.
