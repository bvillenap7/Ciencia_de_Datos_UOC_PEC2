I was driving home on 60fwy west bound near frys electronics, suddenly a highway patrol car start to swaive from right to left as I slowdow my car to see what is the matter. I notice on my front left side windshield there is 4 orange firece object in formation on the top line and 3 of the same orange object on the bottom formation too plus there is 2 extra orange object bounce up and down very fast for 2 to 5 seconds. By the time I try to pull over to the side of the fwy was too late.  The orange object disappears into the cloud.  After that I see a flock of birds fly out as if were to cover the tracks of the orange objects.  I hope someone would help me clarify this incident cause I can't get the image off my head.;34.0032417744913;-117.961627726432
