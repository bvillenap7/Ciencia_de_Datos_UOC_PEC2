Strange aircraft with bright red flashing lights.;2014-02-15 01:59:00;02:02;Strange aircraft with bright red flashing lights. I'm a grave-yard security guard, so I am outside in front of the property  I guard smoking a cigarette with one of the employees who works inside the warehouse.  I start glancing up in the sky when I come across an aircraft with bright blinking red lights flying really slowly.   I tell the guy next me in Spanish,  mira ese avion que raro se mira solo tiene una luz roja.  I told him how strange that aircraft look because it only has one colored light.   I tried following it through the property but it was gone within minutes.  So I got to my phone and tried to lookup a plane like that.  And found a link of a person who saw what I saw and that is how I found this website. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
