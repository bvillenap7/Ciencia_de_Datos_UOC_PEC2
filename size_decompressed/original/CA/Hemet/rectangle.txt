Rectangular craft observed in Hemet California;2009-10-25 20:30:00;5 seconds;Rectangular craft observed in Hemet California I walked out of my home to have a smoke. I walked around to my living room window because I could see the TV through it and Dextor was on.  I looked up and noticed that the stars were very clear.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw something moving, when I focused my eyes on the object I noticed a rectangular shaped craft moving silently with the long side being the leading edge.  It appeared to be two squares connected together with a faint dark green glow outlining the two squares. The light of the half-moon helped me make it out.  It didn't seem to have any bright running lights, it was very stealth like. It appeared to be very large, at least the size of a tennis court, but it's hard to judge size when it's in the sky, especially at night.  Being very surprised at what I was observing, I tried to track it, but after the object was obstructed from my view by the tree in my front yard, it was gone. I made several trips back out to my yard and looked up, but didn! 't see anything else.;33.73826;-116.984929761905
