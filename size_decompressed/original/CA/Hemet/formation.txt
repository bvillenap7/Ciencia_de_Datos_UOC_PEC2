Three poeple seen 25 to 50 star-like flying objects;2008-10-14 10:00:00;10 minutes;Three poeple seen 25 to 50 star-like flying objects On the morning of October the 14th at 9:30, I observed several star-like lights swarming in unison in and out of sight. It appeared as 25 to 50 lights.  The peculiarity of it was that they resembled stars but I could tell they were flying in unison up and around a larger object which I could not see, but the way the star-like objects were flying around, it outlined a larger craft. I was so bewildered that I went over to my neighbors house and asked them to come see it. (a man and woman, ages 61 and 65, I am 36)  Neither of them could make out what it or they were. It was NOT anything we are capable of producing in a military sense. It lasted for about 10 minutes as they made their way eastwardly. They started north, migrated west then east and disapeared. Then about a week later, a linear like silver line appeared in the same vacinity, breifly then disapeared. The next day, the very same thing. Then, tonight myself and that same neighbor lady went to the store and seen in the sky a very bright and radiant red streak in the sky which looked like a possible contrail accept, it was abnormally verticle in the sky. From our sight and distance it was about 3 inches. It disappeared along with the alleged contrail. There were no clouds in the sky, it was a clear sunset sky. It looked like a star-like object ahead of it flying upward. A contrail would have lasted longer in the sky, this just vanished! There is a lot of strange things going on the ksy around this area and I wanted to report it.;33.73826;-116.984929761905
Looked like a low flying jet but soon rested on the top ridge of a small hill.;2017-08-24 21:00:00;60 seconds;Looked like a low flying jet, but soon rested on the top ridge of a small hill. I was headed east on Highway 74 (Florida Ave.) to pick up my daughter from Heritage High School.  I first thought this object to be jet aircraft that was extremely low.  I live near March Air Force Base, so I believed it to be preparing for landing.  Changed my mind when realizing it was way too low for that to happen safely.  It appeared to be heading in a northwesterly direction.  Then the object seemed to stop and rest on the top ridge of a small hill.  I picked up my daughter at this point and told her what I saw.  While it was moving it had 3 white lights.  2 on the ends and the middle one was much bigger and extremely bright.  The middle light seemed to fluctuate like a flare or welderâ€™s arc. While the object was stopped there were only 2 lights visible.  This is what my daughter saw as well.  I drove closer and saw 2 other people in their car that saw the 2 light configuration, but not the 3 floating/flying lights. I dropped my daughter off at home and went to a high point to see if any action was visible.  I could only see one light on the ridge but to the right was a blinking light moving back and forth.  Looked like it could have been movement similar to a helicopter, but it moved too quickly to be so. Hope to see if anyone reports something similar.;33.73826;-116.984929761905
String of SpaceX Starlink satellites passing overhead.  ((NUFORC Note:  Cluster of Starlink satellites.  PD));2019-11-11 18:00:00;5 minutes;String of SpaceX Starlink satellites passing overhead Wife and I were outside while she was having a smoke.  We saw a faint formation of lights approaching from the NW.  Looked like a long stripe of light, as it passed overhead we could see individual lights, they disappeared to the SE.  This turned out to be SpaceX Spacelink satellites which were launched earlier in the day, just in case you get any other similar reports.  According to Heavens Above site they are supposed to be visible again tonight 11/12/2019 about the same time.;33.73826;-116.984929761905
