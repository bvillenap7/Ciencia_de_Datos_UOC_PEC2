On the evening of 7-21-11 at 7:45pm my daughter and I both saw this amazing strange glowing bright orange fireball/spacecraft in the sky over Hemet, California.   it flew in a straight line right over my house for about 50 seconds with absoluetly no exhaust trail behind it and as it had just past my house the fire surrouding the craft seemed to start to blind out for about 5 seconds and then it shot straight up for about 2 seconds and just disappeared it was truely the most amazing thing I believe I've ever seen. Update:  On 7/23/11 at about 11:00pm in the exact same place as the above we both saw it again but this time only for about 10 seconds this time it seemed to be more stationary and just disappeared.;33.73826;-116.984929761905
