RED FIREBALL IN HEMET, CA, SKY.;2012-06-16 21:35:00;2 minutes;RED FIREBALL IN HEMET, CA SKY. ON 6/16/2012 WE WERE OUT IN THE BACK YARD, TALKING AND EATING. THEN WE ENCOUNTER A WHAT SEEMS TO LOOK LIKE A RED FIREBALL IN THE SKY.  IT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY AND FELT LIKE IT WAS AT ARMS REACH.  IT THEN MOVED ACROSS THE SKY TOWARDS THE FRONT YARD.  THE RED BRIGHT LIGHT HAD NO OTHER COLOR THEN IT BEING RED.   IT THEN STARTED TO DIM AND THERE WAS NO MORE FIREBALL LOOKING LIGHT TO IT, THE RED LIGHT BECAME REALLY SMALL AND SAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECT, IT ALSO HAD A TRANSPARENT ILLUSION AND WE WERE ALL ABLE TO SEE A OVAL SHAPE OUTLINE THAT MOVED FROM SIDE TO SIDE WITH THE BLACK SKY THROUGH IT. (FLAT TO SIDE WAYS) IT LOOKED LIKE THE OBJECT WAS BLENDING IN WITH THE NIGHT SKY. THEN THE RED LIGHTS FADED AWAY AND IT DISAPPEARED.  THIS OBJECT HAD NO SOUND AT ALL, IT BEING SO CLOSE. VERY STRANGE! WE ALSO CAUGHT SOME OF IT ON VIDEO.  DID ANYONE SEE THIS???;33.73826;-116.984929761905
