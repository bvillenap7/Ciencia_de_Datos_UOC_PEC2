Was it a jet contrail, a meteor or what?;2007-10-23 14:00:00;40 minutes;Was it a jet contrail, a meteor or what? My son and I were driving east on Florida Blvd. when he noticed a small cloud ball in the sky to our right.  At first we thought it was a tiny cloud (the only tiny cloud in the sky) but it seemed to have a short, fat contrail trailing behind it, so I thought it might be a jet or possibly a meteor falling to earth since there was a meteor shower on Sunday.  But this object didn't appear to be falling down or going anywhere, it was standing still in the sky and appeared to be in suspended animation (now doesn't that sound silly)!  We kept an eye on it as we drove home and once home I stood on my lawn searching the sky for it.  At first I couldn't see it but then I saw something that appeared to be a tiny jet with a small contrail trailing behind, but in suspended animation and going nowhere in the sky, that's what was so weird about this.  As I watched it got smaller and smaller in the same spot and then suddenly disappeared after watching it about three or four minutes.  I am assuming it may have been a jet traveling southeast away from us, which could have made it appear to not be moving and getting smaller as it distanced itself from us, or was it a meteor that disintegrated in the sky, what it was I'll never know?;33.73826;-116.984929761905
UFO spotted over Hemet, CA around 8:49pm Sep. 14, 2008;2008-09-14 16:49:00;1 minute;UFO spotted over Hemet, CA around 8:49pm Sep. 14, 2008 At about 16:49 pacific time my neighbor gave me a call and told me to come outside because there was a UFO above our houses.  I  ran to see what he was talking about and sure enough there was some unknown craft above us.  It was up pretty high up and dark outside so we couldn't tell what shape it was but, it was glowing orange as if it was on fire. The glow was almost as if it was pulsing but not going completely out.  When I saw it, it was hovering in one location and appeared to not be moving at all. About 30 seconds after I first saw it it started to accelerate fairly quickly to the east. It traveled not to far and just disappeared.  I went to my neighbors house as they saw it much longer. They said it was coming from the north and was glowing a bluish color and as it got closer they saw what looked like sparks coming off of it. My neighbor said she was sure a plane was gone drop out of the sky. As it got closer the glow changed from blueish to a fiery orange. And then the craft stopped above them. That's when I got the call and rushed outside.  I have no idea what it was but the orange glow could not have been a normal aircraft. Possibly a military jet with afterburners on flying straight up could explain why it was stationary at first and appeared to accelerate so fast. I dunno but it was the strangest thing I've ever seen.;33.73826;-116.984929761905

From my front view through my windshield I tried to follow its path in the horizon but it just disappeared as quickly as it appeared.   It appeared to be very large and resembled a sphere with a greenish aura at the tail.;33.73826;-116.984929761905
Clear view very high altitude erratic light traveled in circular & short/long bursts, many stops/pauses.;2013-09-06 20:00:00;15 minutes;Clear view very high altitude erratic light traveled in circular & short/long bursts, many stops/pauses I live in a remote area of Southern Ca. with clear view of Milky way. 3500ft, 15 miles to nearest town, 30 minute walk to mail box.  I can see Mt. Palomar Observatory S/E 140 degrees on compass, from my 80 acre property.  I always check sky for meteors that I see somewhat regular.  First time I saw anything unusual. At an elevation far above air traffic, I saw light-dot traveling in circular area appx. size 6 inches diameter.  It would go in a circle, stop, pause, then straight line, stop, pause, turn, straight, pause, circular, stop, pause, sometimes straight in short and long bursts, then back to circular.  Always staying in same area.  I went inside for your contact info and when I returned outside appx. 8:30pm left-coast time, gone;33.73826;-116.984929761905
