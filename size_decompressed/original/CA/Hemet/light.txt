Bright light coming out of a shallow mountain!;2005-11-22 04:00:00;1 week;Bright light coming out of a shallow mountain! I saw circle shaped lights in the sky coming over a mountain moving up and down really slowly. It looked like if it was a giant firefly.

Odd appearance of a light in the sky,not reported by and amateur observer.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet?  PD));2007-06-19 22:30:00;an hour;Odd appearance of a light in the sky,not reported by and amateur observer. I and my family and friends witnessed an odd light in the sky last night. It was a light that appeared to twinkle,with red and orange colors. I am an experienced observer,I was out in the southern part of hemet,california. It was around 10:30pm, and I was out doing some astronomy observing,when i and the others with me noticed it. At first,I thought it was just a plane,but after watching it for a while,its movement did not seem like that of any airplance,helicopter,or even a satellite.I am not sure what it was,but that night was very clear,and very calm atmosphere.

Light changes direction when military jet approaches.;2009-04-18 21:00:00;30 seconds;Light changes direction when military jet approaches. I am filing this report as an afterthought, and some time after the event, in the hope that it corroborates someone else’s sighting. I am an amateur astro-photographer, meaning I take photos of celestial objects through my telescope every dark clear night of the year.  As such, I am quite familiar with the sky surrounding my area. There are aircraft in their designated lanes, the occasional military plane from a nearby Air Reserve base, and countless satellites.  In fact, I see a dozen satellites visually each night out and capture a handful of their trails on each of my photos, to my dismay.  There are also bats and owls that fly by, hunting with their squeaks and screeches.  I am used to it all. Last month, I noticed a “satellite” moving east across the sky. I thought nothing of it and diverted my attention.  I then heard the sound of a military jet in a hurry to get somewhere, which sounds completely different from the usual passenger planes that fly by.  It sounded like an F-16 tanker escort from the military base. I looked back up to spot the jet and saw the “satellite” make a nearly 90 degree left turn as the military jet rapidly approached it from the south-west.  The “satellite” proceeded north-east, closely followed by the military jet with its wingtip lights flashing away. I watched the chase until they disappeared over and the horizon, during the time span of maybe 30 seconds. This happened last month, near April 18th, sometime around 9:00pm.  I did not take notes at the time because nothing can really be done about a sighting like this. I know I was in communication with another astro-photographer via email at the time, and I remember typing “I’m watching a UFO chase…  So what are you taking pictures of tonight?”  To me, it was just another curiosity so I quickly returned my attention to the photographic task at hand. I don’t know what you can do with this late report maybe this can be useful as corroboration for someone else’s report of anything similar to this around that date and time.

second time in one month a light makes a 90 degree turn overhead;2009-05-14 22:12:00;~ 2 minutes;second time in one month a light makes a 90 degree turn overhead This is a coincidence.  Just yesterday, I filed a report about light that made a 90 degree left turn and was being chased by a military jet a month ago.  Last night, I was outside with my telescope, and saw something similar. My wife and I were seeing how many galaxies we could spot through the eyepiece of my little 6-inch telescope in the Virgo Galaxy Cluster.  We were also chatting about what we did during the day.  I relayed to her how I had filed a report for a UFO chase I witnessed last month (which I had told her of the night it happened), and how picky you guys were about spell-checking the report before filing it.  She was telling me about a friend who had just died from cancer. In other words, just the usual talk. Here is what we saw. At 10:12 pm, PDT on May 14th, 2009, we both saw a very bright single light moving eastward, just north of the star Spica. It was as bright as any satellite we have ever seen, like an “Iridium Flare”.  I would say it was as bright as Venus ever gets.  I said to her, “Do you see that bright satellite?” while pointing to it.  She said she did. We watched it moving for a few seconds, at the typical speed a satellite moves.  It then dimmed to the brightness of a faint star.  We know satellites fade as they enter the Earth’s shadow, so it was expected.  What was NOT expected was that the “satellite” made an instantaneous left turn and headed north-east, passing next to the bright star Arcturas on its way.  I watched it fade in brightness until it was no longer visible, in northern part of the constellation Bootes.  I said to my wife, “Satellites never change direction like that.”  She agreed, as she has seen at least a hundred of satellites as well, and is familiar with the way they move across the sky. When we first noticed it, it was in the general area that commercial aircraft take, but it had no blinking lights.  Commercial aircraft don’t make tight turns like that.  And it made no sound whatsoever.  Commercial aircraft are very audible, both as they approach my area, and as they depart the area. There were no other aircraft visible, or audible, at this time. So there we have it, a second mysterious light over my area making 90 degree turns, silently, in a single month.  But this time, I have a witness.;33.73826;-116.984929761905

After dark I saw a white light maybe 1000 feet in front of a low flying jet travelling due north at a relatively slow speed for a jet.;2016-11-01 18:00:00;4 minutes;After dark I saw a white light maybe 1000 feet in front of a low flying jet travelling due north at a relatively slow speed for a jet At 6:30 pm (it was dark)I heard a jet flying relatively low. As I looked up at it, maybe two thousand feet up, I also saw a white solid light maybe 1000 feet in front of the jet.  The jet was flashing with all the normal red and green lights and was pretty loud because of the low altitude.  The white solid light in front never flashed, no noise and headed straight north with the jet maintaining the same distance behind the light fully until both were out of sight.   I could see both objects for about four minutes, starting my visual over the region of Meridian Street near Park Ave.  Flying from south to north, having visual contact well north of the city of San Jacinto, probably over the city of Banning when I lost sight of the objects.;33.73826;-116.984929761905
Two yellow/orange lights above East Hemet;2021-05-30 20:49:00;1-2 Mins;Two yellow/orange lights above East Hemet This sighting occurred on the evening of May 30th, 2021 at approximately 8:49 pm.  I was driving alone, working doing deliveries in the city of Hemet, CA. I was driving thru a quiet residential area when I spotted two lights in the sky above me, moving eastward. They looked like glowing orange orbs and moved silently across the sky. It was difficult to gauge their size as I was also trying to keep my eyes on the road.  I grabbed my phone and snapped a quick photo thru the windshield of my car. I was in the middle of a delivery and couldn't stop to observe more closely or record video.  I sped up to my drop off point which was less than a minute away with the intention of recording the lights with my phone.  I reached my destination, shut off my car and exited the vehicle. The objects were almost directly above me now, still moving eastward and making no sound.  As soon as I dropped off my delivery at the residence, I quickly moved back to where I could get a clear view of the objects. There were trees at the residence that had blocked my view of the lights. As I approached my car I looked up just in time to see them vanish simultaneously.  They didn't fly off, they just dissappeared. The strangest thing about this incident was not the lights themselves but the fact that just moments before seeing the lights, the thought of an alien encounter or abduction had just popped into my head. Coincidence? Maybe, but it was very strange timing.;33.73826;-116.984929761905
