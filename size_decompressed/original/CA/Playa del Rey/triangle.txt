Triangular Craft Seen Passing over LAX.;2001-06-24 13:30:00;10 sec;Triangular Craft Seen Passing over LAX. Sighting occured on the beach in Playa del Rey. While sunning myself on the sand on my back and having awakened from a short doze, I decided to do a little sky watching. I put on my sunglasses and billed cap and scanned the sky just East of the suns corona where the main part of the sun was above the bill on the cap. The area of the sky observed from this position was approximately the Zenith. This beach area is approximately 1 mile North of LAX. My head was toward the water so the runways and departing flights were to my right. After noticing several high altitude jets that had made their cruising altitudes after take off and were now proceeding East, an object suddenly appeared near the Zenith about 10 degrees East of the sun's corona. Focusing on the object which was moving at a moderate clip at about 40K feet in a  N-NW  direction, I noticed it was a configuration of three bright spots, maybe lights, two in front and one in back. There seemed to be a blurry darker area surrounding this config. The sky was powder blue with only a minimum of high altitude vapor making very faint almost transparent clouds. I continued to follow it in its path and noticed that it was now looking like a sharply defined very bright, white in appearnce, angular bomerang shape with an equally bright spot in the rear. After this point it disappeared into the distance. The altitude estimate here is based on the size of a standard 747. still on a straight route.;33.9613;-118.438
