Saw a shape shifting UFO half the size of the moon over LAX;2009-01-19 10:30:00;1 hour;Saw a shape shifting UFO half the size of the moon over LAX Last night I woke up at 4:00 AM and noticed a light moving across the sky next to a star and then disappearing.  It was a very clear night no clouds at all. Then I woke up this morning at 9:00 AM and to my surprise I noticed that there were so many chemtrails!   Then I noticed the moon had a bright object next to it that was very large to the naked eye and it was not moving. I ran and got my camera and zoomed in to find what looks like a space ship of some kind!  It starts moving off to the distance to the west of LAX and then disappears in a poof. But I did see it flying very far off into the distance at the end clip I recorded. Then I recorded more because It came into view again.  Check on part 2 of UFO over LAX!
