Slow moving yellowish/red/orange sphere that stopped in mid air and blinked out of sight.;2016-10-20 20:00:00;1 minute;Slow moving yellowish/red/orange sphere that stopped in mid air and blinked out of sight. Three of us–2 men and a woman–were sitting at our fire at Dockweller Beach sometime around 8PM last night, October 20, 2016.  One of us said, 'Look at that'.  I turned and saw off in the not too far distance something a couple of thousand feet in the air moving at the speed of a helicopter and was about the size of a helicopter, but there were no blades spinning above it.  It was red orange and looked like it was on fire especially underneath the carriage.  It was changing color from yellows to red to orange like, as I said, it was on fire.  It proceeded to move forward for another 15 seconds then stopped dead in the air.  It stayed fixed for about 10 seconds then turned sharply to its right and started go forward, away from us.  After about 5-7 seconds it started to flicker, get smaller, go-in-and out of sight, then blinked out.  The object made no sound that we could hear. Dockweller Beach is right below LAX and planes take off over us all night long. There was a plane behind the object a good distance away and much higher. It could have seen the object. I am a musician and an artist. I had just met the only female with us, so I don't know her background.  And the other man is an actor and writer.;33.9613;-118.438
