Small fireball object traveling from west to east, approx 6,000-10,000 foot elevation.;2012-07-25 21:10:00;:30;Small fireball object traveling from west to east, approx 6,000-10,000 foot elevation. Object made no noise, had no navigation lights (as every aircraft does),  Did not register on any online flight tracking page, also flying in a very unusual pattern for being above an international airport. The two witnesses noticed it while laying on the couch.  The fireball looking object stood out very well against the night sky.  While watching the object come toward us observing it facing west, we watched until object passed over the building.  We ran to the front door approx 25ft away, and tried to resume watching it move.  The object had literally disappeared from the sky. The two witnesses have lived near an airport for almost 30 years, each.  This is nothing we have ever seen before....  ..weird;33.9613;-118.438
