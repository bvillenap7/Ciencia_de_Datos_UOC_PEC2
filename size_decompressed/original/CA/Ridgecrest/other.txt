Multiple similar sized objects not flying as expected with bright lights underneath.;2020-12-11 16:20:00;00:15;Multiple similar sized objects not flying as expected with bright lights underneath. I first saw one then two then three and they appeared to interact with each other. It was too high to give a shape. The best I can say is a speck. I thought at first they were high flying snow geese because they were white.  But then I did not see them flapping their wings so that wasn’t it and they couldn’t be gliding. So a few minutes later I started seeing lights underneath to which you could only see a bright light and no longer the white speck. Another person saw more behind me and she counted 12. I saw 3 to 4 at best. How high mid altitude below 5K feet. They were not moving like an aircraft or helicopter or jet or bird or balloon.  I launched my drone and flew up to 400 ft AGL and scrolled my gimbal to 30 degrees high and hit the record button. I then rotated in place a few times not knowing if I got anything. Upon review I did not see the white specks nor the bright lights but it was either my strobe light under the belly that was reflecting off of t! he atmosphere  or I was just under the objects and I was picking up a peripheral burst of lights as I rotated underneath them. God’s  Truth.;35.6208;-117.6732
