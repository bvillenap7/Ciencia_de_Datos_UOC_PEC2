an object of size,color,and speed of likes I've never seen;2004-10-28 03:35:00;1.30 min;an object of size,color, and speed of likes I've never seen 10/28/04 03:35 traveling north noticed an object (orange) 3 times brighter than venus to the northwest just above the mountains. Continuing northbound a 1/4 mile the object moved behind a cirrus cloud where a large brilliant flash took place. Continuing another 200 feet the object was in front of me approx 1000' up/away. It remained stationary for 20-30 seconds,at this time a black dot top left was visible,then disappeared.  No sounds, no lights, no change in color,no trails. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally serious minded.  Given his experience in the U. S. Navy, we suspect he is an exceptionally good observer.  PD));35.6208;-117.6732
