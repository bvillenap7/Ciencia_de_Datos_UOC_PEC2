Went hiking up in the Rademacher Trail to watch the Perseid Meteor shower.  As your eyes adjust to the dark, there was ONE cloud in the sky.  Black.  It started having what looked like heat lightning and my friend was like ((two words deleted)) do you see that?  Is that something to do with your base?  (I worked at China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station in the Mojave Desert).  I was like hell no.  It dropped out of the cloud, glowing bright orange and cylindrical.

If you've ever seen an irradiating orange cylinder, give me a shout.  ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
