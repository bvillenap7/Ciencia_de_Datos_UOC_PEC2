With Bnoculars it appeared to have a smaller same colored trailing sphere, that orbited around it, then disappeared either into the main sphere or was just out of view. Appeared to energize then would go dim and accelerate extremely fast and able to come to a dead stop immediately.;35.6208;-117.6732
THE OBJECT STARTED EMITTING WHAT LOOKED TO BE FIREBALLS.;2011-02-28 20:00:00;10 minutes;THE OBJECT STARTED EMITTING WHAT LOOKED TO BE FIREBALLS. MYSELF AND TWO FRIENDS OBSERVED AN OBJECT COMING FROM THE NORTH TRAVELING AT A SLOW SPEED AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 20000 FT. ONCE I SHOUTED TO ONE FRIEND TO SEE WHAT I WAS SEEING, THE OBJECT CAME ALMOST TO A STOP, CHANGED DIRECTIONS AND HEADED EAST. AS IT TRAVELED EAST, IT SEEMED TO SPEED UP AND SLOW DOWN. IT DID THIS FIVE TIMES. AS THAT HAPPENED, FRIEND ONE SHOUTED TO FRIEND TWO TO COME SEE WHAT WE WERE WITNESSING. ONCE SHE CAME OUT, IT CAME ALMOST TO A STOP AGAIN. THEN WE SAW WHAT WAS OBVIOUSLY TWO JETS COMING FROM TWO ANGLES TOWARD THE OBJECT. ONE FROM THE WEST AND ONE FROM SOUTHEAST. THE VERY MOMENT WE SAW THE TWO JETS COME INTO VIEW, THE OBJECT STARTED EMITTING WHAT LOOKED TO BE FIREBALLS FROM THE BOTTOM OF IT. SHORTLY AFTER THAT, ITS ORANGE LIGHT FLICKERED ON AND OFF AND SHOT OFF IN THE SKY AND DISAPPEARED TO THE EAST. STILL IN AMAZEMENT FROM THIS EVENT, MY TWO FRIENDS WENT BACK OUTSIDE AND SAW IT AGAIN. THIS TIME IT APPEARED FROM THE WEST. IT HAD THE S! AME MANNERISMS AS BEFORE WITH THE WAY IT MANEUVERED. ITS LIGHT FLICKERED AGAIN AND LITTERALLY DROPPED FROM THE SKY. AS IT CAME DOWN, IT FLUTTERED AS A PLASTIC GROCERY BAG WOULD. IT THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND A NEIGHBORING HOUSE. WE CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THE AREA FOR ANOTHER 10 MINUTES. NOTHING REAPPEARED.;35.6208;-117.6732
Witnessed orange orb over a light pole across the street. Orb moved over a neighbors house.;2013-04-03 21:35:00;5 minutes;Witnessed orange orb over a light pole across the street. Orb moved over a neighbors house. The kids and I saw a UFO tonight. Below is the report from my daughter:  Just got out of Jeep on curb, talked with name removed and turned around to see a bright orange light in the sky.  It was moving fast, looked to have been relatively low due to lack of light distortion.   from the west to an almost south-east heading, where it seemed to fade, either as it got farther, or dimmed. This is the other daughter's report:  I was outside with name removed when she told me that she saw something at around 9:35 tonight.  We had just gotten home from seeing name removed, and were about ready to walk in the doorway.  After she hollered for my attention, I noticed that there was an orange orb above our neighbors' house.  I ran in for my camera, got you, and began taking pictures.  And as we observed, it moved west with us and name removed following both name removed and I and we observed it until it was no longer in our sight. Here is what I saw:  An amber orange object hovering in the northeast sky.  The object was a solid orange seemed to have two points of light one above and below the object.  I think this could have been caused due to the brightness of the light as once the object started moving the point of light faded away. I observed object for about 1 minute before it started moving slowly in a northeast direction before fading from sight. NOTE:  I could not see individual lights on the object, but I could see them in the enclosed photo.  I have noted this in the characteristics section of this report. There were three witnesses to this sighting that occurred around 9:40 p.m. Camera:  Kodak Easy Share Z5010 was used to take the enclosed photo.  The image was cropped with Pixelmator. An uncropped image is available.;35.6208;-117.6732
Orange Orb With Odd Flight-path In Sky.;2016-01-24 02:41:00;5 minutes;Orange Orb With Odd Flightpath In Sky. Saw unidentified orange spherical object, first witnessed at 2:48 in far southeastern sky.  Watched it maintain a natural orbit until 2:51, when it reached the far northeastern sky.   Object started to curve west, then wander for for a bit, before it faded out just west of Neptune from my viewpoint at 2:53 AM, flaring about two or three times before it faded. It was bright enough to capture on phone camera.;35.6208;-117.6732
