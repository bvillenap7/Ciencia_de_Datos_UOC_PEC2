Came out side they wre gone. Then another apeared. got camera ( movie) I'm pretty sure 3 of us seen ufo activity on 4-8-99 at 2:30p.m. the skys were clear.We had went out 2 play horseshoeswhen we seen the STELTH and it's chase plane fly overhead.All of a sudden we seen 3 white objects flying away from the area where the Stelth was flying.We watched them till they flew out of sight. All of a sudden in that same area we seen 2 more objects staying in a still mode so i told my friend 2 get the binoculars.While one of us was doing that the other 2 of us seen yet another ufo object that apeared to be well it looked like a star just sitting there. My friend came outside and said he couldn't find the binoculars so i went around to the front where i seen yet another off in the distant.I went in the house and when coming out they were all gone. We waited about 15 minutes and got ready 2 play horseshoes when i looked strait up and there was another one.I got the binoculars and looked up to see what looked like maybe a weather ballon but as quick as i thought that it changed to look like a rectangle silver shape.I gave the binoculars to someone else and ran in the house to get the movie camera! By the time i got that ready it must have been a couple of miles away. Anyway i did get it on film where it made a classic ufo move, firsta quick move in one direction then another couple of quick moves in another direction.It sudenly disapeared or i lost it from my vantage.  thats it!!;35.6208;-117.6732
