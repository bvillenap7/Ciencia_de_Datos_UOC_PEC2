Immediately upon going outside we noticed flashes of light located in the area of the constellation Sagittarius.  We observed the flashes of light for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. The flashes of light looked like the flash you would see when a camera flash is used meaning the lights would suddenly appear, remain in the same position, and then disappear without leaving any light trails.  The flashes were colored a bright white light with slight bluish overtones.  Overall, we saw approximately 8 to 10 separate flashes in or near the constellation Sagittarius. We checked Heavens Above.com and discovered the ISS was not in the area at the time of the sighting.  Also, there were no scheduled meteor showers for our location during this time period.;35.6208;-117.6732
