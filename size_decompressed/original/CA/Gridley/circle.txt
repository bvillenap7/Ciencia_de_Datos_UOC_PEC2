Circular object with 3 big lights continuously moving from 1 light to another until it made it back around to the first light.;2019-12-20 18:00:00;2 minutes;Circular object with 3 big lights continuously moving from 1 light to another until it made it back around to the first light. The sun was going down when my sister looked up and asked what the object in the sky was.  I look up and saw a circular object with 3 big lights, the lights would continuously move from 1 light to the other, it was just floating in the sky.  I took a video but did not keep it because it was just way to blurry.;39.3514;-121.7121
