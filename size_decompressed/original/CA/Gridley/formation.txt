Silent Lights;2008-07-21 21:21:00;3-4 min;Silent Lights Around 9:20 pm on Monday the 21st of July I was coming out of my shop and was walking up to our back door when I noticed something in the night sky coming towards me from the east. At first I just thought it was an aircraft due to the fact that there was a large blinking red light, which appeared to be in the center.  As it drew nearer I thought that there were an extremely large number of lights around the blinking red light which was larger than any light I’ve seen on aircraft that I’ve observed flying over. Then I thought, it’s most likely one of those sky crane helicopters that’s been used in our area lately battling the fires that has ravaged the surrounding mountains to the east. The next thing to go through my mind was do they have whisper mode, because there was no sound at all.  All of these thoughts went through my mind at the same time as I tried to rationalize what I was seeing. Then I ran into my house grabbed my camera ran back outside to see the object make a graceful turn to the right at which time I pointed my camera up and took one picture. Thinking I hadn’t captured anything because it was dark I lowered my camera while watching the object head north, still hearing no sound.  I went back inside and told my wife what I had just seen and then I looked at the photo I had taken. To my surprise I had captured a group of twelve lights surrounding the larger red light. Also, due to the fact that it was a longer exposure it had formed trails, with three of the trails making the exact same pattern in the sky, which I noticed after I put it up on my computer.  The other thing that I noticed about the red light is, to me it appears to be closer to the left side as it makes its turn.  I have no idea as to what it was whether it was a group of lights in formation or lights fixed on an aircraft.;39.3514;-121.7121
