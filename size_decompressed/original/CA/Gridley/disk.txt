Assuming this was a neighbors lazer light, or some sort of decoration, we kept talking. We realized quickly the light was not a lazer, as it weaved in and out of trees across the street, admitting an orb similar to what a flashlight looks like three ft from a wall, except there was no center. We continued to talk, but we're looking about now across the street at the trees. The green light zipped on the power lines next to us again, causing us to turn around. One craft was spinning. It had green lights lining the center of the one craft, they were no more than 200ft from the ground, and 300ft from us. Both were clearly visible. The other was not moving, and it had no lights. The material was a dark metal. It did not reflect light at all. We heard no sound. My friend exclaimed some curses, and ran to the front door, going in! side. I stayed at the table we were seated at, and continued to look on, as I've seen many UFOS in my life, but never so close. I walked to the front door after 3 seconds of contemplating if I should stay. With my back to the front door, I watched a black helicopter head directly to where the crafts were,from the direction of the street we were watching. I quickly headed inside and recounted the experience with my friend immediately. We checked our bodies for marks, and checked the time. We were okay. This was my idea, since I have had many close encounters before. So as stereotypical as this can get, I know, but they were actually Saucers. I have seen lights, triangles, orbs, but never, saucers. Worth reporting I thought.;39.3514;-121.7121
