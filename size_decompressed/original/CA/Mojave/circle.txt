Line of lights high above the Mojave Desert near Mojave.;2016-02-29 18:09:00;~2 minutes;Line of lights high above the Mojave Desert near Mojave. I was heading North on state route 14 and Dawn road in East Kern County, California, with my son (6yr) and daughter (3yr) when we witnessed 6 to 8, white, circular lights in a straight line oriented in an east to west direction at a height above any mountains in the area.   The lights then simultaneously turned off then came back on after a few seconds.   The lights stayed on for another 15-20 seconds then turned off and never came back on.   As a side note Edwards Air Force Base is about 10 miles east of the area of the sighting.;35.0457;-118.1776
I saw a white solid light moving from northwest to south East.;2021-06-01 21:45:00;2 minutes;I saw a white solid light moving from northwest to south East. The craft made movements kind of from side to side. Unnatural to a winged craft. The craft faded a couple times from white to yellow. There appeared the be a reflection of the light around the object as you looked just off both sides but not completely enveloping the craft, giving the appearance of a shroud. Could of been atmospheric. Never moving at a fast rate of speed, no apparent sound noticible. End of statement.;35.0457;-118.1776
