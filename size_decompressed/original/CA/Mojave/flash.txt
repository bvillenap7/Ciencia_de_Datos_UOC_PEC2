I was opening my front door, which faces North north-east, and my yard was lit up like there was an arc flash directly over my house.  I have done some welding over the years and at best an arc flash from arc welding generally extends to around six feet.  I live on two acres of land with my house is situated in the middle.  This only lasted a few seconds at the most and the entire yard in front of me was completely lit up all the way to the edge.  What I could make out of the shadows in that short amount of time appeared be from a light directly above my house.  When it stopped I saw something like a fireworks rocket arcing to the north east and descend.  It was green/gold in color and none of this made any sound.  It was four days after a new moon. That night the intensity of this light was well beyond a! full moon or anything else I have ever observed.  There are no power lines above or close to my house.  Fortunately I was still under the eave of the roof.  I can only assume that exposure to this intense light could cause blindness.;35.0457;-118.1776
