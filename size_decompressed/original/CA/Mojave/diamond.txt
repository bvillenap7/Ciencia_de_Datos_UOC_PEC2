When I noticed the craft it was on the side of the brick wall where I was standing at.  When it came within five feet of me it started to slow down.  I thought it could maybe be someone playing with a flashlight on a bicycle, but when I looked over the brick wall, i saw only the light and nothing else that could be causing the strange glowing object.  Then it took off in a northern direction, as if it had entered into hyperspeed.  Shortly after, about fifteen to twenty minutes, I went into a hypnotic trance and my memory became impared for about 6 to 7 hours.  I awoke into consciousness about 10:30 a.m.  Tuesday, July 27, 2004.  This event happend in Mojave, California.  Which is about 80 miles north of L.A.
