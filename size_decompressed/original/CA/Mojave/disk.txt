UFO Transported from Edwards Base to Area 51;2011-12-03 02:30:00;2 mins;UFO Transported from Edwards Base to Area 51 This just proves that UFO's do exist.  I was on the drive home from Las Vegas to Fresno.  The roads were clear, due to the time it was.   Pretty soon I see military vehicles on the oncoming side of the road.  There must have been about ten of them.  The lights were flashing.  I was wondering what was going on.   About midway between all of the vehicles, there was a semi with a trailer attached to the back.  Low and behold, there was a UFO clamped down to the trailer and it was being transported.   This has just made proof of the existence of UFO's and how they are covered up by the government.  Could it have been one that crashed or one that they were moving from Edwards Air force base to Area 51?;35.0457;-118.1776
