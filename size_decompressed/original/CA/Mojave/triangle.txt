It was something I can't explain!;2000-12-21 17:54:00;4 min;It was something I can't explain! I am a Paramedic who was working a shift at Mojave airport (our station is located in a hanger).  A gentleman in another hanger called to me while I was outside smoking a cigarette, and said look up it's a UFO. Conditions: Clear 50 miles, brilliant star lite back ground. I saw a object about 500-1000ft. above ground, triangle shape no color more of a void of blackness outlined by 15-20 red lights. Traveling no more than 50 mph. and no sound. This may have been nothing, but I don't believe in UFO's. But I can't explain what I saw. Thought I would make my contribution to the millions of other proof lacking all speculation, HUMMMMMM was it a...? ..... .    . .    . .     . .      . .       . .        . .       . .      . .     . .    . .    . .....

white triangular shaped object appeared suddenly below an aircraft then hyperjumped into space;2004-09-29 07:20:00;2 hours;white triangular shaped object appeared suddenly below an aircraft then hyperjumped into space What I saw was an ordinary looking aircraft of the glider type,  then, I saw what appeared to be a triangular shaped object, color white.  This triangular shaped object was about 1/2 to 1/3 the size of the aircraft in which it suddenly appeared.  It droped directly below the normal everyday aircraft, and then suddenly burst into colorful display of orange and red colors of light coming from the rear delta shaped craft.  It then accelerated at an enormous speed leaving a long contrail of white smoke behind it.  As its speed increased instantly it also began to gain altitude, it then disappeared in the sky, the ordinary looking aircraft immediately landed at the closest airport, which is located at the mojave airport, california.  Other aircraft where in the vicinity, as well as black helicopters shortly after the occurance.  The object made a sound which sounded like a sonic boom, possible from breaking the speed of sound.  The black helicopters that appeared after the occurance had strange effects on the FM and AM radio, as well as lots of mobile phones and remote control devices. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the witness is referring to the flight of the Space Ship One, which flew on this date out of the Mojave, CA, airport.  We meant to flag this report as a hoax, but forgot to do so.  Our thanks to a sharp-eyed reader.  PD));35.0457;-118.1776
Massive triangle object in the night sky.;2013-07-05 23:20:00;2-3 seconds;Massive triangle object in the night sky. I was standing outside with my neighbor facing south/west when out of the corner of my right eye, I noticed what I thought was a falling star.  Falling/flying in a southern trajectory.  Then realizing I see no light trails or burning coming off the object.  Upon looking closer at the object, I realize it is a UFO and not a falling star.  I fixed my eye on the object seeing 3 bright points of light or reflection maybe from the sun due to it being so high in the atmosphere.  In-between the lights that looked like stars was no color other than it looked as black as space.   The object was massive in size and in a triangle pattern or formation flying south at very high velocity.   I heard no sound or noise.   The object was very high in the atmosphere and crossed from north to south in under 2-3 seconds at which point I lost it in the other stars in the night sky.;35.0457;-118.1776
