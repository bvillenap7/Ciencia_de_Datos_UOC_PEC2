Alone, I watched it.  It was almost transparent.  I couldn't see throug it but it was as though it was liquid.  It was the size of a small orange.  Silver in color.  When I finally yelled to the others, who were on the other side of the building to check this thing out, it moved away.  Of course the others didn't see it.  It headed towards the Edwards AFB. It didn't make any noise or course changes.  It just moved towards Edwards. It didn't take long to disappear since it was so small.  I guess since it was so small and knowone else saw it, I dont get many believers.  Well any ways there it is.  If you have any questions please write me at,   ((persnal information deleted.)) @ the size of a small orange silver in color quiet, no noise at all the look of liquid lead but solid;35.0457;-118.1776

VERY fast, passing below sun I could see spherical shape Was observing stealth fighter at aprox 15:30 flying from east to west over Mojave, aprox 7 to 10 thousand feet.  While watching the craft I followed it into the sun.  Using my hand to shade the sun I observed it pass below heading west when at that moment two objects appearing as silvery spheres were observed flying VERY fast from west to east far above the stealth.  The sun caught them at an angle that I could see them for about 5 seconds, and as they headed into clear blue skies I lost sight of them.  The stealth appeared to be flying at aprox 300mph,  the spherical objects were very much higher, I would guess 20,000 feet maybe and travelling 5 to 6 times faster (visually across the sky) than the stealth.  Could not guess actual speed.  They were flying at nearly same speed but not exactly.;35.0457;-118.1776

We stopped to have something to eat before leaving, I was busy setting up things, but noticed that a red light appeared on a hill not far from us,and I also noticed that it turned off as quickly as it appeared I figured they found there campsite, and continued what I was doing. We finished eating when the red light appeared again on the hillside, and it also appeared to be throwing a white light against the side of the hill (headlights) but while that did not seem odd, this did it was moving horizontal along the side of this hill, but when it moved above the hill I begin to take notice. Now I am looking at two hills separated by a saddle, height of the hil! l#1  approximately 200' sloping side's hill#2 same height, but only one side slope's down to 100' hill's run east to west my location is 1/4 m north, sky is clear, temp 50's  The sun had set 20minutes earlier. The red light moves between the two hill's and separate's into three bright white sphere's they form abreast of each other and move in unison. At the base of hill#2 something totally different is happing, picture this 4 columns of red lights stacked one on top of other, like the warning lights on towers moving from right to left and in unison with what appeared to be white lights moving with the columns of red lights which look like the  head light of vehicles passing in front of some obstruction blinking effect, I thought that it was vehicles on hwy 14, but the hwy was some distance away, all this went on for about 30-40 minutes this was a performance for our enjoyment or just showing off! that is the only explanation I offer. the finale to this show was the 3 sphere! s reformed into 1 bright white sphere which turned 180' toward! s us exp anded and brighten then simply blinked gone! This story is not finished. I decided that it would be prudent to pack up and leave, which is what we did. During the period of increased mining the need for a post office was met and one was constructed, the B.L.M. has restored the office as best they could, I noticed the building has we drove past it going  out of the valley.  We found the road which would take us to the highway and home, but something was wrong because instead of the highway we found the post office, again,and again, and again,and again, low fuel stopped the madness we decided to rest until morning. and when morning arrived I had parked 20' from the post office again knowing this it still took more then an hour to find the trail the only trail out of that place all trails are marked by B.L.M. signs Well there it is I had ruled out Military because of the nature of the display there was no other persons in the general area, there was no sound these vehicles were! unidentified, and airborne objects (U.F.O.);35.0457;-118.1776
