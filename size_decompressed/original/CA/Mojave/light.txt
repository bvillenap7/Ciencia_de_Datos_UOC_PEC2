We had pulled off of highway 5 in the Mojave area in the late afternoon, we made dinner and ate our dinner while it was still dust outside. Our rig was facing towards the western sky. When the sky had darkened the base of the mountains lit up, the light begain to rise slowly as it did, it increased in brightness. The light rose above the mountains and hovered for several seconds before shooting across the sky in a easterly direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.0457;-118.1776

My friends and I were camping in the mojave desert, when to the south we saw a light. It was as bright as a star and coming towards us when it stopped. It the zig zagged across the sky and just took off in a totally different direction. It left so fast when couldn`t keep track of it.

Small triangular formations in desert sky,  forming into larger triangle formation;1997-07-16 20:00:00;10min;Small triangular formations in desert sky,  forming into larger triangle formation Watching the night sky over the Mojave desert, I noticed a small light traveling across the sky from East to West, assumed it was a satillite, but as I watched a triangle  formation joined it, traveling at the same speed.   As I watched, more of these formations joined them  and formed a larger triangle consisting of the smaller triangle formations. That is, 3 at the head of the triangle three at  each of the points of the triangle.(9) I was within 10 miles of Edwards Air Force base and thought at first it  was something from there, but as I watched more and more of the lights joined the first til the sky was full of them.   They flew slowly from East to West and disappeared into a cloud cover emerging from the West. Except for the clouds coming from the west, it was a clear brilliant night, stars clearly visible.  No moonlight at that time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));35.0457;-118.1776

Witnessed extremely bright light in sky about 1,000 ft above Edwards Air Force base. The light emanated steadily and moved slowly north for about two to three minutes and was followed by two aircraft.  The light suddenly blinked out, very close to one of the aircraft.

Bright white light in night sky gliding quickly and then fading.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the ISS?  PD));2014-06-22 21:30:00;5 minutes;Bright white light in night sky gliding quickly and then fading. A coworker and I observed a bright white light moving swiftly as if gliding from west to east.   The light was bright enough to create a halo or star beam type effects.   We never took our focus off of it, then it dimmed until no more light was visible.  Its range seemed as though the light turned off with a fade, and not due to being out of range.   It had no other lights, just a solid bright white light.   There were no stars visible at this hour, just pitch black night sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the ISS?  PD));35.0457;-118.1776

These sighti;2020-06-17 04:15:00;one to two minutes;The following observations occurred in rural Kern County California just East of Sierra Highway and North of Backus Road.  These sightings were made outside while sitting in my driveway.  On June 17th 2020, at 4:15 AM I was looking due North and approximately thirty degrees above the horizon I saw a long series of white lights travelling to the East.  There were several dozens of them.  They traveled in a straight line, level to the horizon at a distance they appeared to be a fingers width apart.  Their brightness was equal to that of the dimmest star of the big dipper.  The moon was in the last quarter, four days before a new moon, so as faint as these objects were they quite visible.  I have no way of knowing the actual distance from me or knowing/determining the speed of these lights.  As far as speed was concerned I can only say that they appeared as if gliding slowly across the sky.  Making the activity of the lights even stranger was the fact they a! ppeared as if there was a point in the sky where they appeared to come from behind a curtain.  Stars and other features were quite visible on both the West and the East of this line but the objects were only visible on the Eastern side of the curtain or line.  It was like these objects were coming out from behind a corner or a door way.  This activity went on for some time.;35.0457;-118.1776

This incident is comparable to my incident on June 17th, 2020, the opposite effect happened as it disappeared from view behind a curtain at a point due North.  As above, all stars and other features were visible on both sides of the line but the object was only visible on the Eastern side of this line or curtain.  This was one day after a full moon but the object was quite easily observed.  The speed of this object appeared to be gliding across the sky.  I have no way to determine the distance away from my point of view to the object.;35.0457;-118.1776
White lights unevenly spaced travelling from west to east.;2021-02-21 05:22:00;around four minute;White lights unevenly spaced travelling from west to east. At 0522 hrs at approximately 80 degrees elevation I observed around three dozen lights travelling from west to east towards Edwards AFB.  The lights were white in color and spaced different distances apart.  All were moving in a straight line. Some appeared to be singular and some appeared to be almost double.  The speed was not very fast but appeared to be gliding across the sky.  They appeared at an observable distance and faded from view when they were too far away to be seen.  Their magnitude were about equal to the normal stars in view at the time.  No sound was observed.;35.0457;-118.1776
