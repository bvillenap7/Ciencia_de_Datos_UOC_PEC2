Meteor like object moving slowly eventually breaking apart leaving a blue streak.  ((Vandenberg rocket launch.

This object appeared to be a VERY LARGE meteor but it was wider and moved very slowly in an upward direction.  I asked my husband to join me outside and at that time it broke off in half and the top part continued on for another 10 seconds or so eventually dissapating.  A blue trail could then  be seen in the dark sky.  What was it????? ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD));38.1323;-120.4528
