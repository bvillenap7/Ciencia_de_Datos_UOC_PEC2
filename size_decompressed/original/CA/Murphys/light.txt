My deck faces North.  As it passed by overhead there was no noise.  The light was solid.  As it travelled Southwest the light remained constant.  If it had been a landing light it would have disappeared as the nose was heading away from me.  I am at 3,500 msl, and it appeared to be between 5,000 and 6,000 msl.  Just before I lost sight it appeared to be emitting very tiny sparks which seemed to swarm around the object.  My observation of the sparks was very brief, just a few seconds.;38.1323;-120.4528
