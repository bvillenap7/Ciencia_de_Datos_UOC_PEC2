I normally do not look outside my window when there is an airplane that passes by, but tonight, we practically have a blizzard outside, and it wasn't as loud as airplanes usually are.  I looked outside my bedroom window, and there was something in the sky, a backwards V-Shaped object, with the lights flashing, not like those on airplanes do.  It was flying so close to the ground, and I live on the hill, surprised it passed over the hillside.  It was a really huge object, nothing like you would see in the United States airforce, or probably any airforce in the world, it was too big.  I can't say the objects, as it was snowing too badly to see how big it truely was.  All I could see was the lights.;40.3003;-120.5104
