Two white translucent jellyfish objects repeatedly change shape 5-10 thousand feet high in blue afternoon sky 60-90 Minutes.;2002-09-03 17:30:00;60-90 Minutes;Two white translucent jellyfish objects repeatedly change shape 5-10 thousand feet high in blue afternoon sky 60-90 Minutes. Staying at motel resort in Cathedral City, CA (Palm Springs).  All of us were in the pool on rafts, some guys were splashing and goofing off.  One guy said to the group Is that a weather balloon?  We stared at it.  It wasn't drifting away like ordinary balloons.  Suddenly started to change shape from round to oval to rectangular to square shape (yet still maintaining white jellyfish color.  Three to four metalic speckles kept circling the object.  Wasn't debris nor birds.  This was a clear blue Palm Springs day.  No rain or thunder clouds visible. The object kept same altitude (about 5-10 thousand feet high).  I ran inside my motel room and grabbed my Minolta 4X megapixal digital camera and snapped these shots.  Guys in pool laughed at me, but no one could give positive description of what opbject really was...  All of us perplexed and baffled at what we saw on clear sunny late afternoon.;33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767
