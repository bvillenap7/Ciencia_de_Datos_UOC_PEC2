I noticed a big reddish/amber flash of light as big as the moon itself;2014-10-03 19:30:00;3 seconds;Me and a 3 year old where laying down in the backyard looking up at the moon in the Southern sky.  I noticed a big reddish/amber flash of light as big as the moon itself clouded behind what looked to be a cumulonimbus cloud illuminating it.  The cloud evaporated in a puff after the flash of reddish light.  It was a clear night.;33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767
Yellowish balls came out of the N, cross the sky to the E, and up and disappeared in groups of 6 and there where several groups.;2016-12-25 20:00:00;20-30 minutes;Yellowish balls came out of the North cross the sky to the east and up and disappeared in groups of 6 and there where several groups. These objects came out of the North about mid sky came toward us and cross the sky some just three or four seconds behind the other pretty much the same path towards us then off to the East and up until we could not see them.  This took a few seconds to about 10 before they where out of sight.   This happened as a party was ending and many people saw this.  There would be a group of 6 or so and a few minutes another group would come.  This happened at lease 3 to 4 times over 20 to 30 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.
