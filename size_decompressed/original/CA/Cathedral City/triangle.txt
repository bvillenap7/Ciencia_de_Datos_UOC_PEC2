A small white light which looked like a satellite caught up and passed the triangular shape, it looked and flew just like a Satellite.  Right behind the first white light another white light appearing flying faster than the first white light.  The speed was too fast for satellite, and I thought maybe it was a fighter jet, but no regular nav lights... just a steady white light.. flying &#8531 faster than the first white light and no sound from any of the objects..  Then a third white light appeared heading in almost the same direction as the first two white lights but going a! lmost three times faster than the first white light.  Way faster than any jet crossing the sky and way faster maybe three times faster than a satellite and definetliy not a meteor.   I am used to seeing airliners fly over and satellites.   All four of the objects converged over Cathedral City/ Palm Springs at 6:25pm and all heading in almost the same direction.;33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767

Would zig-zag side to side and at times appeared brighter.  It backlit clouds.  Seemed to have the colors of red, green, and white lights in a bar triangular shape.;33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767
