11-13-07 object over Palm Springs California leaves billowing white trail but makes no sound.;2007-11-13 07:15:00;1 minute;11-13-07 object over Palm Springs California leaves billowing white trail but makes no sound. This event took place while I was working outside-time is approximate but I would say 7:15 or 7:20. The morning was warm and sunny and the sky was clear. When I first noticed it my thought was that it was a plane leaving a con trail (this was very near the Palm Springs airport) but I could not see any object only a large bright white plume. However, something was emitting a billowing plume behind it. The plume was not like a standard con trail- it billowed or seemed to roll behind the object almost like pulsing out-and also dissapated quite quickly - I would say it dissapated in maybe 2000 feet. Another interesting thing to note is that I could not hear it (I was about a mile from it) nor actually see an object ahead of the plume. Airplanes engines make noise and in this valley you can definitely hear them from much further away. I work around the airport and I am familiar with all the engine sounds that our air traffic makes, but this did not make any sound. Mount San Jacinto is approximately 12,000 feet high and was the background setting as this object went by, close to the mountain, heading west to east at an altitude of approximately, based on the height of the mountain, 8,000 feet. I also used the height of the mountain to estimate the length of the trail. I have to believe that tons of folks also witnessed this but found no mention of it on any of the news broadcasts. I have never seen an airplane leave a con trail at that altitude here nor seen a con trail like it. I had my binoculars in the car, unfortunately not around my neck, so I couldn't get a better look at whatever it was. But, as I said, I was working at the time and the work was time sensitive and demanding of my attention so I had to focus back on my work. When I had a chance to look for the object, about 2 minutes later, it was gone or out of sight. Has anyone seen anything similar or perhaps witnessed this same object? I have seen a few unidentified objects through the years but nothing like this. This was totally di! fferent.;33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767
We saw what appeared to be a hovering fireball;2011-09-13 19:30:00;1.5 sec;We saw what appeared to be a hovering fireball My wife and I were driving home in Cathedral City, California at dusk it was cloudy and drizzling.  We noticed an orange/yellow spot of light up ahead that grew in intensity then faded back, all within about 1.5 seconds.  We aren't certain whether the light disappeared behind the clouds, or if it faded to black. I can only guess the distance and altitude:  I'm guessing between 50 and 100 miles away, and perhaps 1,000 to 10,000 feet altitude.  I plotted the course on google earth, and the path went through Lucerne Valley.   I am an avid rocketeer, and I launch rockets at Lucerne dry lake with the club I belong to, but this didn't look like a rocket- it seemed to stay at the same altitude.  I AM certain this was not a firework. I'm now disturbed, because I didn't have a clue where to report this until I googled it and found this site, and now I see that others have seen the same thing!!  I hope it doesn't turn out to be something un-spectacular.;33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767
Bright multi-colored flashing UFO seen above the mountains of Palm Springs, California in August, 2013.;2013-08-01 20:00:00;10 minutes;Bright multi-colored flashing UFO seen above the mountains of Palm Springs, California in August, 2013. Date:		  August xx, 2013 – I cannot remember the exact date now, but it was the beginning of August   Time:  		Around 8:00 pm   Location:	  Cathedral City, California   Direction:  	Looking towards the west, near the tram on top of the mountain    Event:	  My daughter, who is 10 years old came inside the house and told me to come out and look at this strange light in the sky. I went out immediately, and noticed a light, bigger than the Palm Springs tram light in the sky above the mountain ridge. It was positioned a little to the right and up above the tram light (about an inch to the left and 2 inches up above in a visual sense). The light was big and pulsating all different kinds of colors (red, orange, yellow, blue, green, purple, and which) – simply beautiful. I quickly went inside to get the camera, but realized that the batteries were dead. I went out the back with my daughter and also told my wife to come and look at it outside. She’s not that surprised in UFO’s, but casually walked outside and looked up to see the same thing.  This multi-color flashing object was there for about 10 minutes in the sky before slowing descending down below the mountain ridge. It did not reappear. My daughter and I have seen things like this here in the night sky before. I have always believed in UFO’s and have seen a few instances in the past.  I am always looking for them, but for some reason, never really ever see any, at least out here.  I have also talked to others around the area out here that have seen other similar events, but never reported them or talked about them to anybody else. I didn’t know about this site before, and have been very apprehensive about doing a report.  I just usually don’t do reports like these since I consider these events normal, and read others reports all the time.  However, I do feel better about posting this sighting.  I wish I had others to talk to that have had similar experiences, but I don’t. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
