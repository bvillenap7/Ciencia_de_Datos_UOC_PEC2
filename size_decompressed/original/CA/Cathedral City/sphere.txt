Bright growing and shrinking spherical light hovering high over east Coachella valley.;2011-02-23 22:00:00;1 hour;Bright growing and shrinking spherical light hovering high over east Coachella valley. I went in the back yard earlier tonight for a cigarette and noticed a bright light hovering stationary high above to the east of me, it looked like it was over Indio or Coachella somewhere.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, but as I watched it, it split into two lights vaguely as it slowly rose higher.   I went back in the house for about 30 minutes and when I came back out it was still there as a single light, so I grabbed my video camera and started recording and zooming in. With the camera at full zoom the light seemed to be a sphere and pulsate every color I can think of like a rainbow, then it would grow and fade out, and then it would shrink and get very bright.  It seemed to be slowly gaining altitude and kept going through the light pattern I described.  I'm in the house now so I don't know if it is still out there.  I will probably upload the footage to youtube when I have a chance.;33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767
