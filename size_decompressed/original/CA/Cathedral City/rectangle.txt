We approached a bus stop and looked up into the sky and saw what appeared to be an automobile with headlights like the ones on an old model T Ford.  The lights were super bright and pulsating.  It had black grill work with a black knob in the middle.  It was not an airplane.  The lights were shining directly at us.  It got uncomfortably close at a very fast pace.   As I hurried away at a high rate of speed in my car I heard a rumbling noise above my car and then I didn't see it again.;33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767
