I witnessed a tiny dot of light move across the sky laterally at a VERY high rate of speed.;2008-09-19 21:50:00;About 5 seconds;I witnessed a tiny dot of light move across the sky laterally at a VERY high rate of speed. I was walking my dog in an empty lot next to our apartment complex in Cathedral City, California (next to Palm Springs) at about 9:50 p.m. When I noticed a very small dot of yellowish-whitish light moving in the sky from the northwest to the southeast at a VERY high rate of speed -- too fast to possibly be any kind of aircraft. I tracked it move across the horizon for a couple of seconds, but it was small to begin with and began to fade as it moved farther from where I was, and it moved into an area bathed with light from a very bright moon that evening, and I lost sight of it. It absolutely, positively was not an airplane. It was a tiny dot of light. Any airplane I've seen, even at the highest of elevations, never appears as a dot this small. And again, it moved way too fast to be an airplane. It appeared to the eye about the size of the satellites you can sometimes spot in the night sky out in the country. But whereas satellites make a slow track through the sky, this shot across it. It's occurred to me that it could be a shooting star, except there was no downward trajectory to it whatsoever. It was moving laterally.;33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767
Indio Cathedral City Coachella Valley 2012 Sighting.;2012-05-27 18:00:00;20 minutes;Indio Cathedral City Coachella Valley 2012 Sighting In the evening, May 27, 2012, Coachella Valley CA , not sure of the exact time, nighttime,  I was walking through our complex and to my right, to the South West, 4+ glowing white balls of light appeared to be in a vertical line,.  I did not see them moving around.  They were not evenly spaced between each other.  They stayed there for at least 20 minutes, stationary.  I knew already that there is nothing but a hilly area with a space between the hills.  No poles no electrical lines no building happening no hikers in this space.  I took a picture with my flip phone camera (2012), and tried to make a copy which was not clear at all. I have seen 1 video on youtube that is the exact same thing I saw, and a couple other videos showing the objects coming together to line up. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767
Big, Bright, and Moving Bluish-White Light, Suddenly Vanishes into the Night Sky.;2014-07-12 22:05:00;8 seconds;Big, Bright, and Moving Bluish-White Light, Suddenly Vanishes into the Night Sky July 12, 2014, 10:05pm, Location: Cathedral City, CA, (near Palm Springs)  	I witnessed a bright bluish-white light traveling from the NE to the SW across the night sky tonight.   The direction was strange because there are no planes or anything that I’ve ever saw travel in that direction.   It was very high up, but I don’t believe it was in space, because the light was rather large, and a little bigger and definitely much brighter than any airplane.  When the light/object was almost directly over my head, the light suddenly went out.  I didn’t see anything anymore.   It was a clear night tonight, so I should have been able to see something moving, but nothing – it just vanished! 	I do see strange stuff out here in the desert once in a while, when I go out at night, but most of it I never report.;33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767
Intensly bright light appeared through misty cloud then evaporated with the cloud.;2014-09-12 06:10:00;1 minute;Intensly bright light appeared through misty cloud then evaporated with the cloud. September 12, 2014, at approximately 6:10 am, I saw what I thought was the sun coming through a small mist-like cloud.  The light was so bright and becoming brighter.  The sun was far off to my left so I realized it couldn’t be the sun, I was facing west.   The light became very bright and turned into 3 balls of bright light.  The lights stayed for a few seconds and then evaporated in the same spot in the sky along with the misty cloud. There were no other clouds in the sky.  This occurred in Cathedral City, California.;33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767

3 orange orbs in the southern California night sky.;2018-11-25 20:15:00;5-8 minutes;3  orange orbs in the southern California night sky. I was outside, with my partner and his friend, taking the dog for a walk.  All three of us witnessed the following.  We had not had any alcoholic beverages or consumed any prescription medication or the likes that might have resulted in a mind-altered state. At approximately 20:15PST an orange orb appeared in the sky, followed almost immediately by two more orange orbs. They were 3 separate object but flew, silently, together, like a gaggle of geese or a school of fish. The initial orb appeared to drop an unknown object then separate itself from its two counterparts. The orbs flew slowly at first, then hovered for a bit.  The two crafts, that were behind the first, eventually caught up to the first.  After hovering and slowly, seemingly floating around, as if dancing here and there for a few minutes all three orbs flew at increasing speeds and were gone very quickly. We were in awe and later asked some other friends in passing had anyone else seen this event or heard of anything (military or otherwise) taking place that might have caused the phenomena.  However no one wer talked to had seen nor heard of anything. Still, I am left baffled, as I've tried to find an explanation of such an event and have come up empty handed.;33.8058831050227;-116.462412328767
