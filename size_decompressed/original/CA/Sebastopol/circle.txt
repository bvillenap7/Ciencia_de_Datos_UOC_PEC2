Glowing red  ball Sebastopol,CA;1988-06-01 15:30:00;2mins.;Glowing red  ball Sebastopol,CA On a summer evening back in 1988, my cousin and myself were going home.  travling west on hwy. 12, just out of sebastopol but not yet to Santa rosa.  Just as we past the gas station out in the pasture[on the north side of 12]  my cousin said there it is again! Not knowing what he was talking about, I  looked over. Hovering off the ground, about 20 ft., was a red transparent ball.  it seemed like time stood still as we past the object. Both of us turned our heads  as we went past. I was'nt driving so I looked out the back window until I lost sight  of it. I was stunned! We said nothing for the next couple minutes. When we approached  Santa Rosa [about 5 miles down hwy 12] at the intersection of hwy 12 and Stony point  rd. there was the object in front of us. I'm still not sure if it was the same one  or a second one. The only thing said was by my cousin. He said I saw one yesterday.  This was during rush hour Iknow others saw the samething. I've tried to forget about  it over the years but I can't. Since then my cousin has become a religious man.  Me I think it was something else.;38.4015803278688;-122.847996721312
Glowing yellow disc north of SF Bay.;2000-12-17 18:00:00;10-15 minutes;Glowing yellow disc north of SF Bay. On arriving home shortly after dark, I noticed an odd light low in the southeastern sky.  Getting out of the car, my son and I watched a perfectly round, light yellow ball glow eerily for at least ten minutes.  The ball was about 1.5 to 2 degrees in diameter.  In binoculars, it was an unevenly lit ball that would occasionally flare up brightly or dim down to nothing.  Although it did not change position in the sky while we watched it, we did notice a wobble that on close inspection appeared to be the motion of this ball around a central axis.   My son says that when I entered our home to retrieve the camera, he observed the ball fall and rise 3-5 degrees with a falling-leaf type motion.  Although an entire disc could be seen, under magnification, the glow of the disc was not even.  It was more brightly lit at the 7 o'clock position, and faded to near darkness at the 2 o'clock position.  Though this seems more consistent with external lighting, none was observed, and both of us feel that the object was emitting visible light.  No other lights were associated with this object. Although estimating distance of this object would be very hard, my guess would be at least five miles, maybe as far as twenty five.  The ball remained fixed in the southeastern sky, 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon.  The lighting of the object appeared to be internal.  I thought maybe it was a balloon or blimp lit internally for some reason, but it did not seem to move or behave the way I'd expect.  Except for the axial motion, the object I observed was rock-steady in the sky.  We first saw it about 18:00, and about fifteen minutes later, it just winked out. The lights of several aircraft were observed in the same binocular field during the sighting.  The object did not appear to react to the aircraft, or vice versa.  I did take photographs with a 35mm camera and 200mm telephoto lens, but I don't expect much;38.4015803278688;-122.847996721312
Fast moving large circular object appears in early evening sky in Northern California.;2012-11-12 06:30:00;1-2 seconds;Fast moving large circular object appears in early evening sky in Northern California. I was sitting on the patio of the community building in my apartment complex, looking at stars and a few airplanes descend or ascend.  This is approximately 50 miles north of the San Francisco airport.  I looked at the sky straight ahead of me and saw a round object approximately half to one-third the size of the moon, moving very fast in what appeared to be a westward direction.  It disappeared behind trees, which there are a fair amount in this area.  I heard no sound.  The most startling aspect was the speed with which this object moved.;38.4015803278688;-122.847996721312
Circular fast-moving object appears in early evening sky in Northern California.;2012-11-13 19:00:00;1-2 seconds;Circular fast-moving object appears in early evening sky in Northern California. I was sitting on a bench in my apartment complex, looking at stars.  I looked up at the sky straight ahead of me and saw a round object approximately 20-30% of the size of the moon, moving very fast in what appeared to be a northward direction.  I heard no sound.  The most startling aspect was the speed which this object moved and that I had seen a similar, but larger object moving in a different direction yesterday.;38.4015803278688;-122.847996721312
