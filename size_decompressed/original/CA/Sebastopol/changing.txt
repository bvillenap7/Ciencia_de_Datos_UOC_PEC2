Bright green flashing lights in the sky;2013-09-12 21:30:00;5 seconds;Bright green flashing lights in the sky I was in my hot tub when I looked up and saw an airplane's lights flashing.  In front of the plane I saw two sets of two bright green flashing lights.  The green lights were a color I have never seen in the sky before.  Kind of the color of a green 'light stick'.  They moved closer to earth and then joined to become one unit of about 5-6 flashing lights.  I told my husband to turn and look. The entire unit moved diagonally downward the left lower than the right and then became huge.  I could see the individual lights.  About 12-15 lights.  They were square, and flashed individually from the left to the right.  My husband saw the very last light before it then disapeared. The dogs in the neighborhood started barking for quite a while afterwards.;38.4015803278688;-122.847996721312
