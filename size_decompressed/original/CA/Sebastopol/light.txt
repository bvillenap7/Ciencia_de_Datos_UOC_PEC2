two star-like objects traveling in parallel;2002-04-17 20:55:00;1 min.;two star-like objects traveling in parallel Two star-like object were observed moving rapidly across the sky from West to East.  They appeared to be brighter than the planet Jupiter.  They were separated by at least 6 degrees, and remained at a constant distance appart and at the same magnitude, slowly fading out as the receeded toward the horizon.  They were too bright to be satellites, and did not have any magnitude fluctuation.  There were a each a single bright light, no other flashing lights (like on airplanes).  No sound was observed.  Flight lasted less than one minute. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle passed over this area of the U. S. at 20:50 on this date.  Please see www.Heavens-above.com.

Extremely bright white light speeding SE, high over the Northern California coast.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Iridium satellite.  PD));2006-10-08 20:00:00;10-12 seconds;Extremely bright white light speeding SE, high over the Northern California coast. Walking my dog/skywatching with binocs.  Road travels due west.  I looked eastward over my shoulder, hoping to catch the moonrise.  My eye was caught by an extremely bright, pure white object, almost directly overhead.  For several seconds as I reached for my binocs, the object continued to brighten.  It now appeared to have rays emanating from it--sort of like a really close helicopter searchlight.  I was actually squinting.  At this point it was by far the brightest object I'd ever seen in the night sky.  Probably 3-5 times brighter than Venus at it's best.  By the time I'd acquired it with binocs, the object had already begun to rapidly fade, and in a few seconds all I could see was what appeared to be an ordinary satellite--traveling from slightly NW to the SE.  Fastest satellite I've ever seen, and as I watched, it kept going faster!  Lost it in 4-6 seconds.  I don't think it's acceleration was due to that effect you see as an orbital object approaches the horizon and appears to speed up before winking out. This was quite different. And I'm very sure that the initial blaze was NOT reflected sunlight.  That effect wouldn't account for 10% of the light emitted. Besides, sunset was 1.5 hours before sighting.  I have seen the Space Station several times twice I saw the shuttle streak over CA before sunrise.  This object was the strangest (and brightest) thing I've ever seen in the sky.  I briefly entertained the idea that I was witnessing a new supernova, because I couldn't think of anything else that would explain the energy pouring out of this thing.  When I realized it was moving faster than any orbital object I'd ever seen, I gave up guessing. '((NUFORC Note:  Possible Iridium satellite.  PD));38.4015803278688;-122.847996721312
Unusually bright orange oblong blip in low western sky similar to Mars sighting but much brighter and slightly elongated.;2013-12-31 18:10:00;10 minutes;Unusually bright orange oblong blip in low western sky similar to Mars sighting but much brighter and slightly elongated I saw unusually bright orange oblong blip in western sky similar to Mars sighting but much brighter and slightly elongated while driving home from work from Santa Rosa, CA to Sebastopol, CA.  I thought it was just Mars or another planet but it was very unusually bright and specifically caught my eye because it kept appearing elongated. I was driving at the time so I could not get a very good look but it wasn't so significant that I thought it was a UFO at the time. I was sure it was a planet (Mars because of orange color) but had never seen one so bright or appear lengthened.  I also thought for a minute it was plane coming toward me but kept looking to see if it changed shape or moved like a plane does when it fly's toward you but it didn't. It wasn't until I watched a local California news broadcast that I learned that objects or these objects had been spotted by many others all over the state on New Years Eve.;38.4015803278688;-122.847996721312
8 lights in a straight line with 2 flashing red lights hovering over my neighbors house and it slowly moved away and teleported away.;2015-07-11 12:11:00;98 minutes;8 lights in a straight line with 2 flashing red lights hovering over my neighbors house and it slowly moved away and teleported away. It was 12:11 and I saw a reflection of light on my blinds.  I very slowly lifted my blinds and I saw 8 light in a straight line and 2 red lights under it and they were flashing.  Occasionally there was a very small dim light shooting under it towards the ground.  It took it a hour to start moving and when it did it moved slowly but then it appeared a few miles away.  I was watching youtube so I jumped on to that and  20 minutes later it was gone.  I have yet to see it again.   I fear that it was over my house because it was only 2 or 4 houses away from mine.

Bright light blinks in sky above Sebastopol, CA for several minutes.;2016-02-01 22:00:00;~40 minutes;bright light blinks in sky above Sebastopol, CA for several minutes. Not sure of the exact date.  What I saw was a brilliant light that flashed real fast, once like an l.e.d., instant on, instant off for just a millisecond every one minute six seconds.  It happened like six or seven times.   I ran inside and got my girlfriend and told her to look at this spot, sure enough, boom, she sees it three times gets scared and goes back in the house.  It continued several more times and stopped.  It stayed stationary with the stars, it wasn't a satellite, or a plane.  Have you had any other people report anything like this?  I didn't see a craft of any kind or movement.
