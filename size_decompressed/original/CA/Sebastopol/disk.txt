Then it would disappear for a few seconds then hover over our car while we drove down the road that my girlfriend lived on.  Once we got to her house it popped up hovering at an angle over her house for around 20 seconds.  It looked the size of a house.  I myself have never believed in flying saucers but now I believe that I acually have had an encounter with one. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a corroborating report from the girlfriend of the witness.  PD));38.4015803278688;-122.847996721312
Corroborating my friend's UFO siting - it really happened.;2001-10-27 22:00:00;10 minutes;Corroborating my friend's UFO siting - it really happened. It was raining hard that night.  We were driving from Petaluma to Sebastopol and the car was running so bad we didn't think it would make it home.  It was running rough and kept stalling out.   We were driving west on Hiway 116, and we noticed a bright, bright light above the car.  The light was pointing straight down at the car blinding us.  We thought it was a helicopter at first.  When we turned left onto my street, it turned with us.  We slowed down to a stop, jumped out to look up, and it was so bright we couldn't see anything.   We got back in the car and drove to my house, and it stayed above the car all the way home. When we pulled into my driveway, it was right above us.  Then it was hovering above my house, and it was as big as my four-bedroom house.  It gave off a friendly aura.  I wasn't even scared.  I had a warm feeling inside.  It didn't seem like a threat in any way, but like it wanted to make friends.  It had little bright, bright lights all over it.   The whole thing tilted and the lights started blinking alternately. They were giving us a light show.  The lights would go fast, then slow, as if he was showing off.  He tilted on his side, made all the lights blink really fast, then the lights all stopped and it was gone in a blink of an eye.   Then it appeared again instantly, no sound, and sat above the house again.  It tilted one way, then the other, and it was gone again.  I felt honored that it chose me to show itself to.   Reading this over when I finished writing it, I realize it sounds crazy.  But it really happened.  If someone else told me this story, I never would have believed it.   I've never believed in UFO's until this day.  Now I'm a believer.  I got the feeling that they'll be back.;38.4015803278688;-122.847996721312
