My eyes had adjusted well, and was just about to walk back up to the house and do some reading before bed, I looked to the east and saw a group of lights, (maybe 6 or7, didnt count them) not in a straight row, but with a slight curve, not much, but slightly like maybe a bow when its strung. They were not bright, but dim lights, a soft blue/white color (naturally Im color blind so its hard to say) sort of reminded me of the color from a LCD flashlight, but dimmer.  They flew from the east overhead and disapeared to the west. And they were traveling faster than anything I have ever seen. I thought at first it was a series of shooting stars, but there wasnt any trail, or space junk, but no trail. That fast though, get my idea of speed. AND TOTALLY SILENT.............and Im far enough out in the country where therte is not much noise. NOT a sound, nada zip. about 10 seconds after it was gone, I realized just what it was, because I had a similar experience when I was about 11 years old. When I realized what Id seen, I got that same feeling again that I did back in 64, Im still like a little stunned right now, but had to log this down in here, as a safe spot with proof.;38.4015803278688;-122.847996721312
A blue beam of light started at the horizon  ((NUFORC Note:  Contrail, possibly?  PD));2007-11-17 17:30:00;duration of dusk;i saw over the horizon of a mountain exactly where the sun had set a blue beam of light started at the horizon and continuing up into the ceiling of the sky. the beam was as though it was a stationary grand opening spot light beaming into the sky. the direction it was coming from is the pacific ocean at bodega bay. i asked around the next day and two other people had seen the light. ?????????

High-altitude, or sub-orbital, UFO, followed by 3 high altitude military jets in tight formation.;2018-05-03 08:30:00;2-3 minutes;High-altitude, or sub-orbital, UFO, followed by 3 high altitude military jets in tight formation. This entire event was observed with a gen 1+ or gen 2 type Russian surplus night vision scope. On three separate occasions, I have witnessed what appear to be satellites crossing the early evening sky, but demonstrating maneuvers that would be impossible for a traditional orbiting craft. What these appear to be are orbital or perhaps sub-orbital craft, stopping, changing flight paths, sudden alternative movements, etc. However, this latest event, on the evening of May 3, is unique, in that shortly after the mystery satellite object was spotted almost directly overhead, heading due north, then stopping and reversing flight path heading due south . . . three military type jets at very high altitude followed behind in tight formation. This may have been coincidence, or perhaps directly related, I have no way of knowing, but included (via email) is a diagram of the actual event, exactly as witnessed. Though the three military type jets were at high altitude, they could clearly be seen with the naked eye.  The satellite or sub orbital object however, could be clearly seen in the night vision scope, but was barely visible to the naked eye, and soon faded from view as it passed overhead toward the horizon, due south.;38.4015803278688;-122.847996721312
