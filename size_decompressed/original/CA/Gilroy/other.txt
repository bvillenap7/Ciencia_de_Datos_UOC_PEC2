When my friend noticed in the Northeastern sky, three dots that resembled stars moving towards the west in a triangle formation. As we watch them they proceeded to move in there own directions independently. We ruled out everything as planes , or satellite. We determined since the were just small white star like points, they had to have been outside our atmosphere. There were 5 people to whom witness this and all agreed they were UFOs.;37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
