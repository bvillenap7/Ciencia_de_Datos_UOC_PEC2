Please help I am such a skeptic I went outside to smoke a ciggy at about 23:45 when this red light caught my eye.  To my eyes was a good size but I could not give a shape other than a glowing circle, before i took the picture.  It was not flashing light, blinking, it was a steady red glow.  Was not airplane or helicopter.  It was completely silent.  It was low enough for me to see its speed.  It was going at about the speed of a low flying helicopter.  It stopped dead in its tracks when I stood up.  Came back a ways then become still.  Then it went back the other way. I followed it into my back yard and watched it fade into the distance.  I do not get scared easily!  I am such a skeptical person when it comes to things like this.  But I was bone chillingly freaked out!!!  After i regained my thought process i ran inside and woke my girlfriend up in tears.  I thought I was going crazy.  She reassured me after I showed her the picture that I was not.  If you zoom into the picture you ca! n see the object outline.  It looks diamond shaped. It is weird because this happened the same time all of the stuff in japan started.  Please help me prove that I am not going crazy.  I am scared only because I have never seen anything like it!;37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
