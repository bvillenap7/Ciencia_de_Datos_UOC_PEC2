Triangular Craft in Gilroy California;2002-06-08 01:45:00;20 seconds;Triangular Craft in Gilroy California My friend and I were stargazing and hanging out. It was really dark out and my friend looked up into the southeast sky and told me to look up and pointed. I looked up and saw a triangular shaped craft with 3 soft golden-orange colored lights, one on each point of the triangle. The craft was approximately 1800 feet in altitude and flying in a westerly direction at a very high rate of speed. The craft made a high-pitched noise and seemed to move in a skipping type of fashion. The craft flew at an extremely high rate of speed and was visible for only a short time (approximately 10 to 20 seconds). I was astonished and couldn't believe what I was seeing.;37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
TRIANGLE FORMATION OF FUZZY SOFT WHITE LIGHTS 150' FEET OFF GROUND FAST, QUIET!;2002-06-08 01:58:00;20 SEC;TRIANGLE FORMATION OF FUZZY SOFT WHITE LIGHTS 150' FEET OFF GROUND FAST, QUIET! AT 1:48 AM THREE FUZZY SOFT WHITE LIGHTS WITH TRANSPARENT CENTERS IN A TRIANGLE FORMATION WERE TRAVELING EAST TO WEST AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 600mph AND INCREASING TO ABOVE MACH WITH AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 150' AND CLIMBING TO AROUND 2000 FEET. GILROY IS SITUATED IN A SMALL VALLEY WITH THE MOUNTAINS TO THE EAST RAISING TO AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 3000' AND THE MOUNTAINS TO THE WEST RAISING TO AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 1200 FEET. THOUGH THE OBJECT SEEMED TO MAINTAIN THE SAME ALTITUDE, I KNOW IT WAS NOT AT AN ALTITUDE OF 1200' OR GREATER WHEN IT FIRST CAME INTO VEIW, THEREFOR THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE ASCENDING SLIGHTLY TO CLEAR THE 1200 FOOT MOUNTAINS 8 MILES TO THE WEST OF MY LOCATION THAT IS 223' FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL. THE LIGHTS WERE SPACED ABOUT 15 FEET APART FROM EACH OTHER AND HELD A FIXED FORMATION WHILE HAVING NO VISIBLE STRUCTURE BETWEEN THEM. I AM NOT SHURE WEATHER OR NOT THE OBJECT WAS TRANSPARENT OR WAS ABLE TO MIMMIC ITS BACKGROUND IN ORDER TO BLEND IN BUT, IT WAS NOT DARKER THAN THE CLEAR DARK SKY WITH A SLIGHT GLOW IN THE LOWER ALTITUDES FROM CITY LIGHTS. IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE THREE LIGHTS WERE NOT CONNECTED AT ALL. THE OBJECT SEEMED TO REFLECT A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHEN IT WAS ABOVE THE MAIN PART OF THE CITY AS THE THREE LIGHTS BECAME MORE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM EACH OTHER AS THEY REACHED THE DARKER EDGES OF THE CITY BUT, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE OBJECT AND MYSELF AS IT PASSED DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO HAVE A SOFT WARM OFF WHITE FUZZY GLOW TO IT I WOULD COMPARE THE BRIGHTNESS AND LOOK OF THE LIGHTS TO THREE BARN OWLS FLYING THROUGH THE DARK SKY. THE PERSON I WAS WITH THAT WITNESSED WHAT I SAW CLAIMS THAT WHEN I TURNED AND RAN TO GO GET MY VIDEO CAMERA  LOCATED IN MY HOUSE THE OBJECT CHANGED FROM A STEADY LIGHT TO A PULSING JUMPING LIGHT AS IT SLIGHTLY ACCELERATED. THE WHITNESS SAID THAT IT DID NOT MOVE IN A STEADY CONTINUOUS MOTION BUT IN A LEAPING JUMPING WAY LIKE IF YOU WERE SKIPPING FRAMES. WITNESS SAID THAT THE SWOOSH! ING, RUS HING AIR SOUND THE OBJECT MADE WAS ALSO INTERUPTED AS IT MADE THESE LEAPS. I DO NOT RECALL ANY SOUND EXCEPT FOR THE AIR RUSHING PAST MY EARS AS I MOVED AT SPEED THAT PUSHED THE SOULS OF MY SHOES TO THEIR BREAKING POINT. I REGRET MAKING THE DECISION TO GO GET MY CAMERA. I SACRIFICED OBSERVING THIS OBJECT MAKE THESE JUMPS AND SOUNDS FOR A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW COUNTLESS OTHERS THIS EVENT. I TRULY FEEL THAT THIS OBJECT SAW ME RUN AND DECIDED TO DO THE SAME. I GUARANTEE THAT EVERY TIME I STEP OUTSIDE IM GOING TO BE THINKING ABOUT CRAZY TRIANGLES FLYN OVERHEAD.  DAMNIT! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We would very much like to speak with him/her, as well as with the other witness to the event.  We also would welcome a written report from the second witness, since different witnesses to the same event remember different aspects of it.  PD));37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
