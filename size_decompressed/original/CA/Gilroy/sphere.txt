As I was walking out my house facing East, I looked up and all around and to the west I see this Red Orb not bright, and what looks like some sort of fog or haze maybe clouds or smoke around it. As it was traveling south I grabbed my binoculars, then the Red Orb shut off I couldn't see the Red Light anymore, although what I could see was this very dark black square looking object continuing traveling south behind the trees and then out of sight.;37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
