Gilroy California;1996-07-30 11:00:00;8minutes approx;Gilroy California Reference the forwarded photograph taken at the end of July first week of August 1996 time frame. I recently came across this photograph again and scanned it in to my computer, something I did not own when I first arrived in Gilroy enlarging it for a better view I was intrigued by what I was looking at particularly the straight angular bar at the bottom. I believed that there was a seperation between the two objects in the photo but on showing it to a couple of friends they suggested it was connected, the blue in the middle was the sky reflecting on to what must be a very shiny side of the object. All the more intriguing, as this was not what I had taken a picture of. I had been working in my kitchen when from outside a white flash caught the corner of my eye turning to see what it was I noticed what I at first thought was a white plastic bag that the sun was giving a brightness to as it was being carried by the wind. There was no wind this is July/ August in Gilroy Calfornia, as I stood watching trying to figure out what it could be this brilliant white object hovered for a few seconds maybe as long as thirty seconds at times then it would all of a sudden be in a different place in the sky, skipping in zig-zag fashion extremely fast, impossible for anything I had previously believed could travel at such a rate. It would be in one position then literally in a flash a position distant to its original. I watched this erratic zig-zaging and hovering for maybe six minutes. The object seemed to be getting closer as it appeared to be getting a little larger each time. I ran to get my camera, returning the object was closer and larger that any time previous and just hovering. I quickly aimed my camera and hoped I had captured something the object simultaneously disappeared. As you can see there was no no expanse of brilliant white light but the object you see.

Twice in the same place;2001-01-06 04:45:00;still experincing;Twice in the same place I live in gilroy where very little city light is.  I came out of my workshop where I was playing guitar into the night.  I looked outside to the hills and saw a shimmering light then as I watched for several minuetes the light decended benenth the  hillside.  then ascended then descended.  Much more followed. I saw a red light in the sky.  This is not the first time I saw a red light hovering.  In 1992 or so I saw a red light fly right over my head about 200 Ft at this same address.  It was silent, glowing red and moving about 5 miles an hour, I would say.  It was about 50 ft in diameter.  I saw it coming over the same hills that I saw this tonight.  I think they are still here.  When I came in to write this the light moved to an illuminated tower, where there wasn't a light before.  The light I was staring at previous was gone.  It moved to the tower. Hey, I wrote to the editor before.  Can you ask him to reply?. I haven't seen a ufo since 1992.  But today marks a new turn of events. I think this is real. ((name deleted)) I am scared of who this could be. but at the same time I envite them. but I really am scared. thanks. ((name deleted));37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
3 BRIGHT LIGHTS HEADING SOUTH  3:00 AM  YOU COULD NOT HAVE MISSED THEM!;2004-06-24 03:02:00;4 MIN;3 BRIGHT LIGHTS HEADING SOUTH  3:00 AM  YOU COULD NOT HAVE MISSED THEM! ABOUT ONCE A WEEK OR SO DEPENDING ON THE WEATHER I SET OUT MY CAMCORDER AND FILM A TIME LAPSE OF THE NIGHT JUST TO SEE WHATS GOING ON UP THERE WHEN NOBODY IS LOOKING.THE REASON WHY I CONTINUE TO DO THIS IS BECAUSE I HAVE WITNESSED SOME ODD THINGS THAT HAVE INFLUENCED ME TO TAKE A DIFFERENT PATH IN LIFE. I FEEL THAT IF I COULD CAPTURE ONE OF THESE ODD EVENTS ON FILM IT WOULD HELP EXPLAIN TO OTHERS WHY I AM SOO DIFFERENT NOW, NOT LIKE I GIVE A RATS ASS ABOUT FITTING IN WITH THE REST OFF THE FLOCK. ANYWAY, I DECIDED TO FILM LAST NIGHT BECAUSE OF THE EVENT THAT OCCURED A FEW DAYS AGO IN ARIZONA WITH THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SAID THEY SAW SOMETHING IN THE SKY. AT 3:00am I WENT TO CHECK ON MY CAMERA TO MAKE SURE THE LENS ON MY CAMERA WAS NOT ACCUMULATING DEW. I WAS TAKING THE USUAL CHECK OF THE SKY AND JUST WHEN I FINISHED MY 360. CHECK I NOTICED TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE SOUTHERN SKY. I QUICKLY GRABBED MY CAMERA AND TOOK IT OUT OF THE TIME LAPSE MODE WITH A BIT OF FUMBLING AND WAS ABLE TO CAPTURE TWO OBJECTS THAT WERE ABOUT AS BRIGHT AS THE BRIGHTEST SATELLITES YOU HAVE EVER OBSERVED. THE OBJECTS WERE MOVING SOUTH IN  BETWEEN THE STARS ALTAIR AND VEGA. ONE OBJECT WAS A FEW DEGREES AHEAD OF THE OTHER LICKE THIS `\,  . THEY WERE MOVING MUCH FASTER THAN SATELLITES PLUS I WENT ON THE WEB AND USED THE J-TRACK 3D PROGRAME TO SEE IF THE SPACE STATION OR ANY SATELLITES WERE PASSING OVERHEAD AT THAT TIME. ACCORDING TO EVERYBODY WHO PROVIDES DATA ON SPACE DEBRIS THE SKY WAS CLEAR.;37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
triangular 3 bright light craft flying silently near Gilroy,  California;2007-05-29 21:00:00;30 seconds;triangular 3 bright light craft flying silently near Gilroy,  California I was driving in my car coming from Gilroy, California travelling east on highway 152 east halfway towards Interstate 5 opposite a very large reservoir as the full moon was out and the sky was clear.  The CHP was investigating an apparent truck accident across the road when I saw three very bright white lights in triangle formation fly at a 180 degree angle which was flying sideways fly over the accident at about twenty miles an hour silently.  There was no noise and the craft was flying at a very low altitude perhaps twenty feet above the ground and came right at me and straighted out and flew right over the hood of my car and it picked up speed and disappeared over the reservoir.  At first I thought it may have been a life flight helicopter but this craft made no noise and my car window was open.  I had the feeling the craft was friendly and was concerned about the accident.

pulsing light  20-50 miles out from gilroy probably over saratoga or los gatos;2007-06-27 21:53:00;3 mins;pulsing light  20-50 miles out from gilroy probably over saratoga or los gatos In the process of closing my daughters window (which faces north) I notice an amber light not moving to the north west. After about 2-3 mins it winks out. return to the room for more observation at 10:13 wait a few and the same light appears, This time same spot, the light rises from behind hills , pulsing like before 2-3 mins.  I estimate the light was about 20 to 50 miles out from my position.The hills are about 10 miles out.;37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
The light was falling straight down out of eastern sky.  The light was extra  bright like a planet in summer.  This thing moved really;2011-10-17 19:25:00;2 minutes;The light was falling straight down out of eastern sky.  The light was extra  bright like a planet in summer.  This thing moved really slow.  Once it stopped going lower, then it started to move east and got brighter.  After about 30 seconds of moving east, it dimmed and disappeared.  My wife and I just went out to walk, which I turned on the sprinklers.  I checked to see if my wife was clear of the grass, which is when I seen it in the sky.  Amazing scary and kind cool.   I wonder what it could have been.  It was close to the flight pattern into san Jose, but thus went directly back into it quickly.   Plus, there were no indicator lights.  I know my commercial planes, this was not a plane.;37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
Seven lights in sky over North Gilroy.;2013-11-28 19:21:00;7 minutes;Seven lights in sky over north gilroy. From my house looking at 030 degrees lights were going from left to right  brighter than any plain flying by.  Each light appeared to be not connected and when they were starting from the left they appeared to be from the horizon then gaining altitude before it appeared to head east and disappear.;37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
Looked like a spot light high up with a blue green light beam in the center. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:05:00;5+;Looked like a helicopters spot light high up with a blue green light beam in the center of it.   The light continued to travel up and west, but blue green light stayed stationary in the sky and turned into a streak of light.   The white light started leaving a vapor trail as a comet would.;37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
Strange sound, like a whistle going high then low then high, then a plane emerged from a cloud that I hadnt seen enter it.;2019-03-19 21:00:00;~3 seconds;Strange sound, like a whistle going high then low then high, then a plane emerged from a cloud that I hadn't seen enter it.  Looked like a normal plane, far as I can tell but made a very strange sound.  Simply flew off north after emerging from the cloud at normal plane speed.;37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
