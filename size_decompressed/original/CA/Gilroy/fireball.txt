Very bright white/light-green light going East-West seems to expand suddenly (explode ?) and vanish in a fraction of a second. Trajecto;1999-03-03 22:51:00;< 1 sec;Very bright white/light-green light going East-West seems to expand suddenly (explode ?) and vanish in a fraction of a second. Trajectory going down at about 15-20 degrees inclination. Object itself not seen, only trail of light observed. Total length (at arm length) about 1 - 1 1/2 in. Note: This is a resubmission of earlier report with date and time corrected. While driving North on Hwy 101 in California, 5 miles So of Gilroy (about 40 miles So of San Jose), a bright light attracted my attention. Was about 45 degrees above horizon and slightly on the left of the road, traveling from right to left but descending at about a 15 degree angle. It first appeared as a very bright trail which quickly formed a blob with raggedy edges about four time the width of the original trail. Looked like it was exploding. Then everything disappeared. There was no residual trace forward. Seen at arm length, the trail (tail?) was about 1/2 inch in length, the blob about the same in diameter. There was some light clouds but the object light was very bright and could have been seen through them. The duration was very short, one second at most and object was gone by the time I called it to my wife's attention. Could have been satellite/rocket reentry, but direction seems wrong. Could be a meteorite.;37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
In the northeast sky while star gazing,  myself and two buddies overlooked a bright orange light which we first assumed was jupiter.  F;2003-12-26 23:08:00;10 min;In the northeast sky while star gazing,  myself and two buddies overlooked a bright orange light which we first assumed was jupiter.  For five minutes we paid no attention to this Planet however my peripheral was drawn to its increasing intensity once again. About the size of jupiter, this object burned a bright orangish red.  Using a fence post as a fixed object it seemed to be traveling  south west indirectly in our direction at a very slow pace It appeared to be growing even more in intensity.  Al the while my friend was retrieving a fresh battery for the camcorder.  As soon as the battery was placed into the camera the glow seemed to do a standing 180, and over a 15 sec period dimmed and as the camera was turned on it flashed 3 times in 3 second intervals, brightness decreasing each time and that was that.;37.0155309153707;-121.577839896374
