I got a real close look...;2001-05-07 20:10:00;3 min;I got a real close look... My sons(2) and three frinds called me outside to our deck to observe a strange light moving around in the sky about a 1000 yards from our home. Upon seeing the light(s), it appeared to be a plane w/landing lights on hovering avove a hill. After watching it for a minute or so with no sound I grabbed a camera. The craft slowly came our way very slowly but still no noise. I snapped photos(not developed as of this writing) as it came towards us at about 200 feet in the air. As it passed very slowly over the house I could hear no sound. It was shapped like a large wing with white lights eluminating the bottom. The bottom was not smooth but had a lot of structure. As it came towards me it had two big white lights close together pointing forward and also blue, red and white lights. Moved slow out of sight.;39.2032;-121.1958
Up to five triangle shape craft with flashing lights seen flying in a circular pattern;2011-10-20 20:30:00;2.5 hours;Up to five triangle shape craft with flashing lights seen flying in a circular pattern In Penn Valley, We saw up to five of these ships flying around in a big circle several nights.  I know of about 25 people who have seen these.  They appear to me to be triangles with flashing lights. The video is about six minutes and there is no sound.  There is a video made and it has been put up in Youtube:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XJfZQZ8Di0&feature=youtu.be;39.2032;-121.1958
