Large Light green flamelike shaped object or light flying horizontally;2009-06-15 23:15:00;12 secs;Large Light green flamelike shaped object or light flying horizontally Was driving home from work 11pm ish on hwy 15 heading north near deer springs exit and suddenly say a light green flame shaped light heading north ( in my direction) appeared from behind a hill. It looked to be about 200 feet long and in about 6-10 seconds disappeared behind another hill It was moving quite fast and horizontally I had my window open and don't believe it emitted any sound no doubt about what I saw and was totally surprised at the unusual color  ( light green ), direction of travel and large size!  Observer is former Air Force, and scientist. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
Teardrop, yellow and green.;2014-10-19 23:00:00;5 seconds;Teardrop, yellow and green. It was bigger than any shooting star we have ever seen, and it shot straight down to the earth. It was yellow with green trails around the outside of the teardrop. It was way faster than a Meteor would have been. It left my buddy who was driving in disbelief, and he doesn't believe in anything like that till tonight. Couldn't get pics or videos because of how fast it happened.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
