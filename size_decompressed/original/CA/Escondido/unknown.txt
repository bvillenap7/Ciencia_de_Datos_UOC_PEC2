Object over North San Diego County with flashing colored lights for ove an hour.;2000-10-14 02:30:00;over 45 mins;Object over North San Diego County with flashing colored lights for ove an hour. While visiting my wifes parents home in Escondido after going to bed around 0200 I was laying facing out the sliding glass doors when I noticed what at first I though was an airplane however after watching it for a pireod of about 5 minutes I notice that it wasnt moving. It had what appeared to be lights alternating colors from red to yelow to white to blue and orange. My wife thought it was a helicopter or lights on a tower but I got my binoculars and it was way to high. We then thought ok its a star or something but as we watched it you can tell the stars were moving and this object was not. We woke up my wifes mom to verify that there was no tower with lights in that direction and we all watched it for over an hour. It was to far away to disearn a shape. We did call the Escondido PD. After about an hour or so the object shot up at about a 60 degree angle and dissapeared. We looked for it the next night but saw nothing...;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944

Star-like object seen above San Diego Wild Animal Park.;2010-08-22 05:00:00;0:30;Star-like object seen above San Diego Wild Animal Park. I was outside, and I saw what I thought was a plane about 10-20 miles away (toward the San Diego Wild Animal Park).  The course was pretty linear at first, but I noticed a few minutes later that it had started to zigzag.  The effect was very minor, as one wouldn't notice if one weren't staring directly at it. After a minute or so of zigzagging, it parked in the air for about five minutes, then began again.   After another few minutes of movement, it parked again.  After about ten minutes of staring at it, I had to go back into the house, and wasn't able to see it again.  The entire time I was watching it, it looked like a bright star or a plane.  It had a white-blue glow, and it pulsated with a red glow.  The final time I stared at it, I could swear that I could see barely visible points of light dancing off to its side.  There was no sound, no distinguishable shape, and it didn't touch down. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Saw a craft ejecting red flares over the night sky in Southern California;2013-11-04 20:04:00;8 minutes;Saw a craft ejecting red flares over the night sky in Southern California On Monday, November 04, 2013, at approximately 20:04 hrs., my girlfriend and I walked out of our home to take our dog for a walk in the northwest part of the city of Escondido, California. As soon as we walked outside, I noticed a reddish/amber light in the northwestern sky.  The light was so bright that I mentioned it to my girlfriend and said something to the effect of “I wonder if that’s Mars or Venus so bright tonight?”  We both stopped to look at the object and we both noticed that it was moving.  We kept our eyes on it as we walked another 50 feet or so.  The light moved from our northwest to our southeast.  We both stopped walking, and I remarked at how bright the object was, but that it didn’t have any blinking lights on it (the kind I normally would associate with an aircraft).   As the object was flying in the southeast horizon, we clearly began to see red flare-like objects coming from the bright amber lighted craft.  The objects were glowing red, similar to the color and intensity of a roadside flare.  We saw approximately nine (9) of these “flares” come from the craft over a span of three (3) to five (5) minutes.  At least one of these flares broke apart into two independent “flares”.  We watched them fall downward under trees obscured our view of them.  They were still lit/glowing as they disappeared from our view. After the last of these “flares”, the bright amber craft simply and suddenly “winked out” and disappeared from the sky.  It did not slowly fade away, nor did we see it fly away.  It was simply visible one moment, then gone the next.  It may be worth mentioning that we could not hear any jet or propeller noise from the craft. We felt that what we had seen was odd enough that we contacted the San Diego Sheriff’s Department, and described what we saw to them.  The SDSO connected us to the Northwest Region of the FAA.  I spoke with a lady named Karen who conferenced in a man named Charlie from San Diego Tracon (sp?).  Charlie was unaware of anything that should be dropping flares over San Diego County.  Karen suggested that I contact the UFO Center.  I spoke with Mr. Davenport who asked us to write a description of what we saw while the details were still fresh in our minds.  Mr. Davenport asked that we contact the National Weather Service for wind speed information.  We called the San Diego office of the National Weather Service, but could not reach a live person. I hereby attest that everything I have said in this statement is the complete truth. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be both eloquent in his description of the sighting, and serious-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness, and highly reliable.  PD));33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
