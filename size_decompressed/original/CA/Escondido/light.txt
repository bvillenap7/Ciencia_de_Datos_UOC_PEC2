Driving home my wife and I saw a orange colored light (looked a lot like a star) either very close together if not one light in the air, about as high as a helocopter would fly. Yet there was no sound.  They broke or seperated into 3 lights.  The two smaller lights seperated from the brightest light (to my wife they looked like they went in front of the brightest light and to me it looked like they were pieces that fell off the main light.) One of the dimmer lights stoped moving while the other two continued on moving. About 30 seconds apart the two dimmer lights slowly faded out and disappered. Then aproxemietly 3 min later the brightest light slowly flickerd out and disappeared.  We don't know the extent of the entire time of the event. ((NUFORC Note:  Unidentified lights are very difficult to investigate.  The report is not inconsistent with landing lights on distant commercial aircraft, approaching for landing.));33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
My husband and I witnessed a bright reddish, gold light with no sound, change directions several times prior to disappearing.;2000-06-02 22:00:00;10 minutes;My husband and I witnessed a bright reddish, gold light with no sound, change directions several times prior to disappearing. My husband was in our backyard moving the sprinkler when he noticed a very bright light coming coming towards him from the west. Friday night was very dark, no moon light to speak of.  The stars were very visible and unusually bright.The light was quite large and much brighter than any of the stars and was moving east over our backyard.  He came in the house to get me.  After we ran out front of our house the object which was moving in a straight line and had no audible sound had just come over the top of our house and was moving in an eastward direction.  If I had to estimate the size, I would say it was about the size of a small pill held at arms length.  An airplane came from the south going north (which we did hear) and crossed in front of the object.  The airplane was about twice the size of the object. Once the plane was past the object and out of sight, there was no sound again.  The object then seemed to come to a stop, then start to move to the south.  It never appeared to turn, just change direction.  It went for about 30-40 seconds south then change directions again and go back north. It appeared to stop again and start to go backwest over our house again.  The object never appeared to turn, just slow down or stop then change direction.  It also seemed to get brighter then dimmer then brighter again.  In looking at it through binoculars it appeared to be reddish, gold color, not a flame, but have a sparkling energy moving it.  My husband indicated that when he first saw the light in the backyard, he thought it might be a helicopter, however, as the object came closer, he saw a row of lights inside the brighter light.  Not red and green, just moving lights in a row inside the brighter light.  After watching the object for approx. 7 mins.changing direction approx. 5 times it seemed to hover for a couple of seconds then go up and out.  I can't say it took off, it just turned off.  It didn't die out, the bright light just went out, like someone turned off the light.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944

bright blue, high altitude, direction changing, speed changing light in the sky.;2008-05-18 21:47:00;10 minutes;bright blue, high altitude, direction changing, speed changing light in the sky. We observed a bright blue light moving slowly but apparently at high altitude. It came from the west then headed in a northeast direction. When it was overhead of us it just stopped and stayed in that position for about three minutes. At this time we grabbed a pair of binoculars but it still looked just like a very bright blue spot. Also, it wasn't always a constant light. It would pulsate, sometimes very brightly. When it started moving again, it was moving fast and due south until we lost sight of it.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
Unusual, pulsating blue light near Cygnus;2008-07-14 22:01:00;10 minutes;Unusual, pulsating blue light near Cygnus I just finished observing an extraordinary phenomena in the eastern sky, south east of Cygnus.  The local time was 10:01 PM (when I first started observing) and the event spanned until 10:10. The object was a pulsating, star-like object that stayed within about 5 degrees south east of epsilon-Cygnus or Gienah. What first struck me was the brightness, near that of Deneb at its peak, but falling to darkness within a few seconds. It repeated this behavior many times. The other aspect was the color, a brilliant blue.  This was observed from central Escondido, California - near 33 deg 7' minutes north, -117 deg 3 min west. So the obvious issue was the elimination of possibilities. First, the object did not travel in a straight line and did not appear to be moving at a velocity for orbital motion, so it certainly didn't seem to be a satellite.   Second it nearly hovered at some points, not characteristic of an aircraft.  Considering the time duration it was no meteor.  The color and therefore the color temperature, would match a very high temperature object, above 10,000 K.  Not a common object near the Earth.   It did move in the sky, so it wasn't a distant astronomical object.  It didn't seem to progress like a balloon, but that is up in the air. It was no Chinese lantern with that intense blue color.  There was no sound. It was too long in duration for an Iridium flash, and was too blue.  So it could have been a high altitude UAV or other test aircraft with a bizarre blue light. It might have been a balloon with a similar light.  It was certainly a mystery and I wondered if it had been observed by others. I am an engineer and amateur astronomer and have been observing the sky for many years.  It was also observed by my wife. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounds to us to be an exceptionally qualified, and capable, witness.  He remains confident that what he witnessed was quite unusual.

I viewed the object from my drive way while smoking a cigarette,  I looked for flashing lights to indicate an aircraft but saw none, this may be due to the extreme altitude it was flying. it moved swiftly and shifted in color from yellow to red before disappearing.  The object was about as bright as the surrounding stars.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944

The thing is, is that we have seen it three times now.  Tonight it was around midnight, on July 23, it was around 11pm, and we saw it first in June.  It was around midnight again, but we thought that was going to be a one and only sighting!  Seeing it again in July made me start logging it down. This light spends several minutes at a time  just sitting in one position.  Then it leaves, all three times in a different direction, at a good rate of speed.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944

The one changing colors seemed to be following the blue light.  At times the changing color light stopped or was left behind and the blue light flashed a bright blue light kind of communicating with the changing colored light.  Then both moved up until disappearing into the sky. This is not the first time we see the lights but sometimes it's only one. They usually tend to appear after 10pm at night and come up from the same spot.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944

I was looking at the moon and looked to the west I saw a blue flashing light.It was as bright as a star.I thought it was a satellite. It was to high to be a helicopter and it was not a plane.  I called for my daughter and she did not know what it was either.  I continued to watch the light blink for 5 mins and it started to move west and dissapered.

Also the flight pattern was extremely irregular very slow and went from low on the horizon to very high. Never touched ground.  Also it either hovered very high or flew in a straight pattern for an extended period because it didn't look like it was moving.  Finally, after hoovering or flying straight at a high altitude for a few minutes the light shot off 5 to 6 smaller redlights in a slow succession like chaff from a plane. The light  began blinking aggressively less than ten times and completely disappeared from sight. Two people saw the light in the sky however this will be the only report. Weirdest object I have ever seen in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
Pulsing light seen in South Escondido, CA was very fast and like nothing I have ever seen.;2010-12-03 21:00:00;5 mins;Pulsing light seen in South Escondido, CA was very fast and like nothing I have ever seen. Very bright when 1st sighted. Flashed red, green, blue, yellow, orange. Seemed to be rotating. Hovering for several minutes. It moved away from us very rapidly, faster then anything I have ever seen flying and I have seen many military aircraft in the years I have lived in this area. It dimmed very fast and disappeared suddenly and was gone. This is nothing like my fiancee nor I have ever seen. No sound at all it is a very quite night. It seemed to be about 2 miles away and the size of a dime from that distance so it must have been fairly large. At times it there also appeared to be a second much smaller shape off to the right very close but may have been an affect of the flashing. The flashing was not timed or steady but more pulsing and was brighter sometimes then dimmed. The shape seemed to be disk or round as much as we could tell. That is about it.

Intense green pulsing light in sky;2011-03-31 00:15:00;appr. 10 min;Intense green pulsing light in sky Quiet evening, just after midnight, setting out the trash for pickup. At first I thought it was an unusually bright star in the north west sky. As it got closer I realized it was a bright green color (like a green laser). I called my wife out with the binoculars for a second opinion. It was a single point of intense green light that pulsed on and off at different speeds and intervals (almost like morse code at times). It slowly traversed directly overhead in in a southeast direction, slightly changing velocity and direction as it went. Its movement was slower than a passing satellite (taking about 10 minutes from horizon to horizon). When it was overhead it was much brighter than Sirius. Even with binoculars it still looked like a single point of light. It made no sound, but it did frighten my wife. She was grabbing on to me and hiding behind me. I have never seen her react this way to anything. This sighting happened over a year ago. At the time we saw it, I documented all the details. Hearing Peter Davenport on the radio motivated me to file this report.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944

I watched it move in a half circle when i called for my daughter to come out and see the light.  It made no sound and somtimes it looked more green then blue.  We watched the light make a complete circle around our niegborhood. My daughter tryed to get a picture but it didnt turn out.It flashed every once and a while then faded untill it was out of sight.    A few mins later we herd jets flying over and my daughter said she herd them on and off for an hour.  We have seen this light befor just last week and also last year.  My husband an niece have also witnessed this light.  I read on here that another person reported seeing last month.  I dont know what it is my husband thinks its boarder controll helicoper.

Intermittent pulsing blue light at high altitude with random movement;2012-10-15 21:02:00;55 minutes;Intermittent pulsing blue light at high altitude with random movement Incident Date: 10/15/2012 11:02 PDT  High altitude, blue/green light appeared in the visual vicinity of Jupiter.  Object appeared to Pulse at random intervals and with random lengths of duration. Object was first thought to be stationary, but after approximately 2 minutes of observation, it changed position in the sky.  The object continued to appear around the area of Jupiter in the sky.   Moving in a random, yet semi-circular pattern, it remained in a relatively small area of view until approximately 11:15 PM. At this time the object appeared to move in a South Westerly direction, but at varying rates of speed and with multiple apparent sudden darting movements and course deviations. The object then appeared once again to stay in a relatively small area of the sky, but continued exhibiting sudden bursts of movements in random directions and often at near to absolute right angles. I continued to watch this object for approximately 55 minutes before it eventually seemed to either cease to emit light, or moved out of visual range. Throughout the entirety of this event, the pulse demonstrated no apparent pattern or rhythmic behavior as would a typical aircraft anti-collision light array. It was also not accompanied by the typical white and red lights of traditional aircraft. Based on my personal experiences as a pilot and lifelong aircraft enthusiast, with a profound understanding of aerodynamics and atmospheric phenomenon, I would estimate the object to be upper atmospheric or low space in altitude. There was no accompanying noise to indicate any type of typical aircraft propulsion and the ability to both “hover” and perform abrupt, high speed changes in direction as well as sudden bursts of acceleration run contrary to what is understood to be within the aerodynamic capabilities of winged or rotor aircraft. I.e. the altitude alone would prohibit sufficient lifting across a typical wing surface without the object having to move at a constant and extremely high rate of speed. The object also demonstrated none of the typical behaviors of satellites or other near earth orbiting objects, either Geo-stationary or Geo-synchronous.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944

First object noticed had single light no aircraft running lights observed or sound attention to eye came from believing it was a satellite-- moving from west to east, just below Venus just bright enough to be believed to be a satellite yet dim enough given relative speed to the stars to believe same. Watched for  minute- then noticed second light in tandem, about a fist width apart to the southwest-- caught interest as never seen satellites orbing in tandem. Got binoculars. Again more single lights appeared from west, below Venus, .... then third... fourth.... fifth... evenly spaced-- same relative speed.... counted total of 28 following same flight path, same relative speed each a single light- no running lights no sound at all, all moving west to east at velocity one would believe was a satellite in orbit. Only guess would be aircraft leaving a carrier to land at an airbase in San Diego-- but no sound at all-- and only a single light- no red/green flas! hing running lights.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
Two distinct lights, similar to satellites, one following other, rotate about axis, change positions and then direction.;2014-09-16 04:40:00;20 seconds;Two distinct lights, similar to satellites, one following other, rotate about axis, change positions and then direction. I was just outside our house in Escondido at approximately 4:40am on the morning of 9/16/2014. My husband just went back inside for a minute.  I was staring up at the sky, stargazing as I very often do. It's a treat when I get to see a meteorite or even a passing satellite.  But this time... There were two very bright, but very high lights passing from East to West.  I've seen many satellites passing in my life, and if I had to guess, they were many miles from each other, but within about 5 degrees from each other in my field of view.  They looked like most satellites do when passing, a white to red/orange reflective light, but they were slightly brighter than other satellites I had observed.  One following the other perfectly. Then, a few seconds after I saw them, they rotated about an axis and switched positions while still moving West, and continued on in perfectly swapped places.  Then the new lead light continued on, while the new trailing light veered off South and disappeared.  The leading light soon disappeared (faded) as I would expect of a satellite reentering the earth's shadow. All of this in the span of 15-20 seconds.  My observation covered an arc of about 45 degrees from the time I noticed until the remaining light was not visible. I have observed many passing satellites, the space station, the old shuttles in my life.  I am a smoker who is up late night and early morning and go outside and stare at the sky.  I've never seen an event like this, and my main reaction was to repeatedly say out loud, What is that?   And this was of course one of the few times I've walked outside without my phone on me, not that I think it would have recorded a viable video even if I had gotten to it in time.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
