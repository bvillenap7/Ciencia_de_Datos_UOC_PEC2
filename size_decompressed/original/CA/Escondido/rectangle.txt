LARGE Ship of some sort.;2012-12-07 21:15:00;2-3 seconds;LARGE Ship of some sort As I went outside to go toss out the trash, I saw from my side peripheral vision flashes up in the night sky.  The flashing looked to me like the type you see right before a lightning strike. Thinking that it's odd since the skies looked clear, I immediately looked up & to my surprise, saw 3 large flashing spheres. For that split second I looked up & saw the flashing spheres, they stopped flashing at that point. However, after they stopped flashing,  I was able to make out a LARGE (COLOSSAL) dark rectangular object sailing by from which the spheres were flashing under it. For the MONSTROUS size it was, I heard no sound. Best way to describe what I saw in simple terms: A silent sailing TITANIC ship with 3 large round white spheres flashing from underneath. I was stunned and amazed at the same time.  I've seen in the past, on other nights, a strange red/orange shiny light strongly brighten & then drop some type of flares/orbs on 2 or 3 different occasions.  But this night, I saw something much more intense & phenomenal!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

On the evening of April 10, 2014, at 9:15 P.M., my husband and I were traveling on Interstate 15 north in north San Diego County, California.  My husband spotted a bright light in the sky.  It was too low to be a star and it did not appear to be moving.  We took a picture of the light. After viewing the photo, we noticed two rectangular illuminated objects, side by side, and directly above the objects were three saucers with lights around the diameter. When taking the picture, the bright light was the only thing that was visible.  But, once viewing and expanding the photo these images appeared.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
