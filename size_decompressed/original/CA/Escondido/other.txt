This was a night sighting of a slow-moving, kite-shaped craft with lights on it, 20-25 miles north of San Diego, CA.;2005-07-19 22:40:00;20-30 seconds;This was a night sighting of a slow-moving, kite-shaped craft with lights on it, 20-25 miles north of San Diego, CA. Object: Kite-shaped, but shorter and wider than a typical kite-- approximately a 5 to 4 length to width ratio-- travelling toward what would be the top of the kite.  The following diagram approximates the axes of the kite shape.  | -|----  (Direction of travel: <---) |  At the nose there was one bright light flashing at about one-second intervals, along with two smaller, softer white lights, close together and slightly off-center to the left.  There was one soft white light at each of the other three corners, not as bright as the strobe.  No red and green port and starboard lights.  As indicated in the diagram, the cross-axis defined by the side lights was no more than 20% of the total length back from the nose-- too far forward to be at the wingtips of large modern airplane designs.  The lights made it difficult to see the shape clearly, but stars disappeared and reappeared behind it at the edges of the kite shape-- i.e. not as would occur with wings and a fuselage.  Size: Visually equivalent to a Boeing 757 at 2,000 to 2,500 feet altitude.  That is also our best night-time naked-eye estimate of its maximum altitude.  Sound: A loud, fairly high warbling whine, from a single sound source. No jet exhaust roar, definitely not a piston engine. Also, there was no interference beat or other indication of multiple engines/sound sources. (I'm a musician, and am used to using wave interference to tune instruments, and used to distinguishing between single or multiple voicings of a given sound.)  Speed:  The object took about 20 seconds to go from directly overhead to disappearing beyond trees and a ridgeline two or three hundred feet high and a quarter mile away. Estimated distance traveled while in sight no more than one mile.  The other witness is an ex-pilot, multiple-engine rated.  Her first comment was that it must be in trouble, because the sound was all wrong and it was at or below what would be stall speed for an airplane that size.  Direction of travel: Northeast, with Polaris in sight for visual reference, observed from a house and walkway oriented within one or two degrees of true north-south. The sky was clear except for some high mackerel (cirrus?) clouds off to the south, with a three-quarter moon.  Location:  Del Dios community on Lake Hodges, approximately 4.5 miles southwest of the town center of Escondido, California.  (Note: An ex-air force friend, told about a similar sighting in February of 2004, said it's one of ours but would not go into any further details.);33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
Line of eight orange lights that didn't move. It appeared, a few lights went off, came back on, then all went off simultaneously.;2012-11-20 19:05:00;10 minutes;Line of eight orange lights that didn't move. It appeared, a few lights went off, came back on, then all went off simultaneously. I went outside to get my mail at around 19:00 or 19:05. As I was turning around to walk back across the street and up my driveway, I noticed a line of lights to the north of my location.  My street is on a hill, so it is easy to see far away to the north.  As you look north during the daytime, you'd see a mountain in the direction of the UFO.  However, the UFO was above the mountain, so it couldn't have been on the side of the mountain.   Anyways, I was staring at it and it looked like it was right over the city of Escondido.  The shape was a slanted line of orange lights the right side was the side that was slanted up.  It was fairly small, so I couldn't resolve the lights with my naked eyes.   After looking at it for a few minutes, all of the lights went off except for a few on the very left side.  I ran to grab my binoculars (they are 15x70), and when I returned, I saw three small, close together lights through my binoculars. I ran back to my house to get a tripod! because my hands were shaky, and when I returned, all the lights were back on.  I saw eight small, orange lights almost in a straight line, except the lights on the sides were curled up, as if the lights were on a saucer.  I couldn't discern a craft I only saw the lights. I stared at it until all the lights went off simultaneously. They just vanished.   During the whole time I watched the lights, none of them moved they all stayed in the same place relative to each other and relative to the ground. I watched them until about 19:15, which was when they disappeared.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
Reddish orange trail.;2016-12-01 12:46:00;120 seconds;It was a rounded craft with a long sail looking thing pointing downward and when it took off there was a reddish orange trail.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
Long duration, dash-like appearance, intermittent disappearing.;2019-10-01 18:15:00;40 minutes;Long duration, dash-like appearance, intermittent disappearing. Just before sunset.  Object in hovering-type behavior.  Slow moving. Slowly moved from SSW towards the North.  It intermittently faded in and out from view as it moved.  Then it was gone for a few minutes and reappeared a few degrees to the South and started moving towards the South.  It was difficult to identify the shape.  Using binoculars it appeared ash-like but reminiscent of the To The Stars Academy footage. Kind of bulky on one side, narrow on the other.  But not egg-shaped.  Seemed to rotate in a similar manner.  I'd guess the height was anywhere from 5 miles up to 20 miles.  I already tried to look up if any weather balloons were released but couldn't find any leads.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
