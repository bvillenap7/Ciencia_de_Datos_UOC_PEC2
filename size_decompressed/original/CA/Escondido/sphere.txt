After about 2 minutes of viewing, they just disappeared. 3 objects were spotted in the sky that seemed to behave in a weird manner. They were flying in formation but seemed to cross each other as they were moving forward. They were round, almost oval in shape. There was no sound. An airplane was in sight but going in the opposite direction. They were visible for about 2 minutes. The other strange thing is they did not just continue out of site, they just disappeared. I was playing golf at the time at Meadowlake golf club in escondido, ca. I was standing in the 10th fairway looking towards the green, the objects came out of the N/E direction and went in a N/W direction.They did not have any wings or tails like normal aircraft. I live close to Camp Pandelton and see formations of helicopters quite regularlly. These objects were moving about in their formation too quickly to be considered helicopters.This is my first witness any strange objects that I cannnot explain.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
Bright Unusual Lights Shapeshifting and Pulsating in Escondido CA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of stars??  PD));2012-09-25 21:00:00;6 hours;Bright Unusual Lights Shapeshifting and Pulsating in Escondido CA We have wittnessed pulsating bright lights sense Aug.16 - Sept. 25 2012.  I imagine They will continue. It started off one evening when my neighbor knocked on my door to look at something in the skies within sight of my backyard. I was shocked and took pics of this bright starlike object.  When the pics were examined from my smartphone we realized it was not a star but a shape Shifting anomaly. My pics were scary.  These things pretend to be stars until you examine your pics and realize they are not stars!  Now I have 10-12 dotting the mountainside in my rural area.  I'm affected by the amount now of these things and plan on leaving This area. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of stars??  PD));33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
Star sized reddish orange glowing sphere seen hovering, floating, and disappearing in Escondido's night sky.;2013-03-17 00:16:00;3 minutes;Star sized reddish orange glowing sphere seen hovering, floating, and disappearing in Escondido's night sky. It was around 12 that night that I had left a friends house and walked down the street to wait for a ride. Minutes later I noticed a small red/orange glowing orb or sphere in the sky up high and off the horizon.  I was surprised by this due to the fact that it was not a clear night, but instead one with rather low visibility having only a few stars in the sky. At first I thought it was mars, but then quickly dismissed that as the hovering object began to move across the sky about the same speed as a plane, yet with no flashing lights or noise just a silent steady glow.  The object continued to float across the sky in an upward zig zag pattern for a few minutes, which made me think it could have been a red chinese lantern, but I could tell by the size ratio in the sky and the high altitude it was at that this could not be possible. As it approached a nearby star the object stayed motionless, let off a white glow and then faded into a dim light (that could have been mistaken as a star) and then ultimately disappeared and vanished into thin air. After its disappearance I was left in shock feeling uneasy, and overwhelmed, the experience even led me to tears.  Although the whole event only lasted roughly 3 to 5 minutes it changed my life forever. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Orange orb clearing sky multiplies into three, one goes back in the direction it came and the other two kept going.;2013-12-15 19:17:00;3 minutes;orange orb clearing sky multiplies into three, one goes back in the direction it came and the other two kept going. We saw a bright orange/gold light that looked as if it was ascending but then took a different direction and started to clear the sky. It came from an eastern direction and traveled to the west. As it was moving above us, it looked as if it was expanding and looked like it was dropping a bomb.  The color of the object it dropped was orange/gold as well and looked like it was falling towards us. I was thinking that if it was bomb we were in trouble.  The object that was falling then started to go back to the eastern part of the sky and the original light kept moving in the western part of the sky.  Then the original light split in two and traveled together out of sight.  This object was moving in a very high speed.  It looked as something was melting out of it.  I was able to see something because of the moonlight but not able to make sense of what it was.  It was still orange under the moonlight but I canâ€™t think of what type of craft can come so close and not make any kind of sound. In total there were three objects, at first as one then it multiplied.  They were the brightest objects in the sky.  It was not a meteor because these objects took different paths, one went back to the eastern sky and the other two kept moving to the west until they disappeared.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
Orange/red pulsating sphere suddenly appeared in the sky and continued dimming and brightening before fading entirely. Never moved.;2014-08-25 22:09:00;3-4 minutes;Orange and red pulsating sphere suddenly appeared in the sky and continued dimming and brightening before fading entirely. Never moved. At approx 10:09pm PST tonight, I saw a sudden bright light appear in the sky just above the treeline and hill tops.  The light increased and decreased in brightness and was the shade of an orange streetlamp.   Upon stepping outside for a clearer look, I noticed it had a primarily orange color with what looked like red lights spread throughout.   The light continued pulsating in brightness but appeared to be staying in the same position.  It would grow faint and then bright again until after about 3-4 minutes max, the light slowly faded from view completely while still in the same spot.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944

A shooting star appeared to enter the atmosphere and became a grey sphere travelling at high speed from west to east at around 19:35.  It was silent, left no trail or sonic boom, had no lights or blinking lights of any kind.  It went from directly above to the eastern horizon in 3-4 seconds. As it left the sunlight that's when we could see the shape and greyish matte color as the object grew larger in size and disappeared into the darkness of the night.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
