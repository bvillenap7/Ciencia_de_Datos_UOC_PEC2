It was during the middle of the day.  I saw this object as well as my father. I was travelling in a pick-up truck west bound towards Escondido, California with my father in the spring of 1991.  We were going to install a motion light for my step-grandmother.  We were stopped at an intersection stop light.  An oblong bright blue (cigar shaped) object had appeared in the sky from what seemed out of nowhere.  It was stationary in the sky for perhaps less than a second and then accelerated and disappeared again it what seemed a split second.  When I saw the object appear in the sky, my first reaction was to point at it and comment on it to my father (he is a law enforcement officer)  But before I could even say a word the object had disappeared.  Both of us remained speechless.  After a minute or two I asked him if he had seen the object and what he thought it was.  We were both astonished and speechless which perhaps explains the initial silence.  We had both commented on the bizaar sight and suggested that it had been an UFO. I was quite suprised by my father's suggestion and acknowlegdement that it may have been an UFO.  We have never spoken a word to one another about it since that day. It just seems too awkward.  What we experienced was very unique. I am now 22 years old.  Born in 1975.  I am a college student considered intelligent ( to most).  I am neither a believer or a disbeliever of UFO's,  but I am open-minded to the possibility.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944

He jumped up and exclaimed what the **** is that!?.   Looking up, we both noticed a cigar shaped line of neon blue, almost LED lights.  The lights stretched the entire width (from what we could see). The lights would also start to glow brighter, then dim back down.  This happened throughout the entire event.  The craft was coming from the North, East of us, and slowly heading South. Because it was dark and the moon was out, after a few minutes it was hard to keep an eye on without using our peripheral vision alone.  The last thing we noticed, was the craft did not follow the curve of the earth as it went south. It stayed in a single location in the sky, yet grew smaller and harder to see.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
