Neon orange dougnut shaped craft drops blue balls of lights;1998-09-15 22:30:00;4-5 Minutes;Neon orange dougnut shaped craft drops blue balls of lights This occured in 1998 and again in 1999.  I was about to leave my girlfriends house, when I noticed what appeared to be a neon orange doughnut slowly approaching from the south.  This object looked like a doughnut, round with a black center and made no noise at first.    As it got closer, it dropped a small blue ball of light that fell approx. 30-40 feet then went out.  It did this four times by the time it was overhead.  By now I had become quite excited (my girlfriend was crying like a wuss) and produced my lighter and began to flash it at the object which looked like it was less than 1000 ft above us.  After flashing my lighter a bunch of times, this thing stops. it didn't slow to a stop, it just stopped.  I stopped flashing my lighter and waited for something to happen.  It dropped another blue light, so I flashed my lighter again.  When I flashed my lighter at it, it moved pretty damn fast to the left and then to the right, then changed it's shape to a thin horizontal line and with a bang just like a car backfire, it shot away at an amazing speed and left a small cloud of white smoke that faded as fast as it appeared.  The bang that was heard woke my girl's dad up.  We told him what we saw and what it did.  He told us we probably saw a military aircraft that was dropping flares.  What a crock of you know what!  I am very military oriented, and I know that was no damn plane or jet we saw.  I also saw this same craft with ny mother about a year later.  Did the same thing (dropped blue balls of light) but this time it was cloudy and it made a sharp angled left turn into a cloud before anyone else got to see it. If anyone else has seen a this craft or one like it, please report it!  I would like to hear if anyone else has seen this!! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Dark loud-like shape suddendly appeared on the sky, then changed into a funnel-like shape then split into three round disk shapes;2011-03-02 16:25:00;1.5 min;Dark loud-like shape suddendly appeared on the sky, then changed into a funnel-like shape then split into three round disk shapes I was driving north from San Diego to my house in Escondido at around 4:30pm. on a sunny, clear blue sky with some white clouds. When I reached the top of the hill at Racho Bernardo, I saw a small (far away) dark (grey) cloud-like shape suddendly appear on the sky over the San Pascual Mauntains. The dark shapped cloud changed shaped very quickly and it streched to a funnel-like shape and then back to more rounder shape. a few seconds later it split into three round shapes that started moving left and right slowly and they appear to fade in and out. the round shapes then started moving faster in short, random directions like a pinball getting smaller and larger, and then all three shapes flew or disapeard from my sight behind the mountain. Seriously????? I even took off my sun glasses to make sure it wasn't anything stuck to them.. I looked away and then back to see if it was only my vision but no it was real. I'd be interested to know if I was the only one who saw this.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
