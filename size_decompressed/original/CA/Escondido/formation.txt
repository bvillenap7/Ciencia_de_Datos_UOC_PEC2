Unlike mother and baby birds though because they were all traveling in tight fromation and at the same speed, which appeared faster than any baby birds would seem capable of.  Altitude was low, probably less than 500 feet  Lead object must have been about 6-10 feet nose to tail and was oblong shaped. formation flew out of line of vision into a canyon;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
6 horizontal lights appear to be large craft hovering over Leucadia California.;2004-02-09 20:11:00;5min. 13sec.;6 horizontal lights appear to be large craft hovering over Leucadia California. After taking sunset photos from a hill-top in Escondido, CA, (With a view over the city lights, looking west, towards the ocean) A string of 6 horizontal lights appeared suddenly along the coastline, approximately 10 miles away & approximately 1300Ft. I could not see what the lights were attached to. I would guess the craft was about 200 yards wide from my vantagepoint. The 6 orbs seemed to rotate through colors from left to right, shimmering. They remained in formation, stationary, and (one to another) for 5min. 13sec. Until they vanished out of sight, as quickly as they had appeared. The lights never changed their position in the sky, to each other or the area. I have taken thousands of photos, with the same camera, from the same hill, for over 5 years, and have never seen anything like it before. I have lived in North County more than 31 years and have never seen Camp Pendleton (Marine Corps Base) produce any similar visual displays while commencing military exercises. I also grew up next to Oceanside Airport, in addition to spending many hours at Miramar Top Gun School watching all the various types of planes. So I know what different craft look like in the night sky. In my opinion, these 6 lights are not ours! ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the several photographs, provided by the witness, and they show 5-6 unidentifiable lights, oriented horizontally.  We do not know what the lights are, although we believe that military flares may be a possibility.  However, the witness indicates that he thinks that flares are not a possibility, since the lights remained stationary, and they didn't exhibit any smoke.  PD));33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944

Saw lights appear on my left.   First 2 then several began appearing and vanishing only to appear again.   4 made the shape of a diamond and started pulsing.   Then gleaming like a diamond under a lighted case.   They moved slowly in several different directions before I passed a mountain and lost sight of them.   Many drivers on the freeway were braking and swerving while watching these things.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
