Cone shaped craft;2003-01-16 22:00:00;10 minutes;Cone shaped craft Me and my friends just got home from shopping for a birthday present, upon exiting the vehicle, one of my friends looked up and pointed out to the rest of us what appeared to be an illuminated orange construction cone flying toward us. We watched for about 3 minutes , then it started dropping what looked like burning cinders from the bottom that seemed to burn out before touching the ground. Then the object changed directions, moving away from us. we watched for another few minutes and it seemed to burn itself out, but would keep re-lighting itself. we watched it as far as we could before we could no longer see it.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
