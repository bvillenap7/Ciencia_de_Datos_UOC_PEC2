I ran outside to get a better look as I had been looking through a window, but the UFO was gone. I was in an art class at about 9:00 in the morning. I was working and I glanced up in conversation. Through the window (a large window with black plastic divisions) I saw what I at first thought was a momentary flash in my field of vision but it remained in my view and I saw something of a very thin white oval, almost a line of white, streaking very quickly across the sky. It was very small, I could have covered it with the tip of my fingernail. It was out of view within a second. I ran outside to get a better look at it but it had disappeared.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
Spherical craft with flashing lights around it.;2008-10-28 03:00:00;5 seconds;Spherical craft with flashing lights around it. I was sleeping in my son's room.  I got up to open the window to the bedroom.  It was a very cool and clear night.  I watched a spherical craft as i was looking into the Southwest skies.  It had lights around it flashing.  It came into site from the bedroom window.   I saw it travel at a high rate of speed in a downward motion until I could not see it because the neighbors house was blocking the view.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944

Tonight as we were walking on platanus Drive, looking directly due north, there was a red oval glowing sphere.  We get lots of military aircraft flying from camp Pendleton heading east so we're used to seeing all kinds of stuff, but this was just hovering with a red solid light, then it would go off periodically for a second or two, then get bright red again.  Looked very large in the distance not something up close like a drone or anyting.  Then it just disappeared;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
