The brightness would intensify then subsided then intensify again. Then I would see bright particiles releasing and falling to earth in a straight line. As this ball of light slowly moved toward me. Another one appeared from the east again moving at a faster rate. The 2nd one I noticed approx 22:24. The 2nd one stopped. The light will would intensify and then subside like the first one and release light participles as well. Both move westernly. The first one disappeared and the 2nd one changed course and move easternly. Approx 22:28 a police car passed by my house as I was still observing the 2nd ball of light. It appeared that he was looking up in the sky in the same direction as I was but not sure if the officer saw it. Police car kept driving and turned into another street.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
IT APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE AND TOOK OFF AT INCREDIBLE SPEED!;2002-04-22 03:55:00;approx. 15 sec.;IT APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE AND TOOK OFF AT INCREDIBLE SPEED! In the early morning of April 22nd, at 3:55 A.M. I stepped outside to light a cigarette. I looked up because I usually do as I have witnessed sights in the past many years ago and it is just habit now. Just as I looked directly up, facing the southeast, I noticed a white, star-like object appear out of nowhere. It glowed unlike a star and then went out. I continued to stare at that area in the sky and the light appeared again. It stayed like that a few seconds, went out again and came on again about 3 seconds later. To my absolute amazement, it began to move north slowly. It moved approximately the width of a face of a quarter, at arms length. Then all of a sudden it took off at the most incredible speed I've ever seen! It left a hazy bluish, white trail for an instant and disappeared. This was the second sighting I saw that week. On April 18th at around 9:30 P.M. I saw a stationery red light from the same spot I witnessed the previos sighting. However I was facing due West. The light appeared out of nowhere, went out for about 10 seconds, appeared again and went out. This was not a plane because this light did not move. I reported it to MUFON a few days later only to find out that there were 2 other witnesses to a day time sighting in that same location. The witnesses were pilots on the ground. It hovered over the police station. Needless to say this has freaked me out quite a bit. Had I been a couple of seconds earlier or later I would not have seen these UFO's.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
Red circular craft, vertical ability;2011-07-04 21:15:00;2 mins;Red circular craft, vertical ability  While watching fireworks from our hillside, we first saw a red pulsing craft and watched it come across the sky horizontal from the north of Escondido/Valley Center area it then ascended vertically quickly into the atmosphere.   A few moments later, another craft approached with the same red pulsing lights from the same area and came a little closer.  We again watched it ascend vertically into the atmosphere. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  We assume an evening sighting, and have changed the time above to reflect that fact.  PD));33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
3 more red crafts;2011-07-04 21:45:00;2 min.;3 more red crafts  My husband and I earlier saw two red objects in the sky when we were out watching the fireworks from our hillside.  I reported them immediately.   We then went outside again and saw three more of the same. My husband is a pilot. These were not planes.  They came from the north and he estimates they were flying 5,000 to 7,000 altitude.  They all went to essentially the same area then descended vertically into the atmosphere.  We watched the red lights to about 35,000 until we could not see them anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above to reflect an evening sighting.  PD));33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944

I gazed up into the sky, and saw a moving orange ball like aircraft.  I thought it was a Chinese lantern at first, but soon realized that the lanterns do not move very fast.  It was an orange-red circle figure.  It moved normally in a straight line heading east/southeast.   Then after 20 seconds of doing that, it started ascending into the sky.  It took about 7 seconds to ascend before disappearing.  A few seconds before ascending, it made a jet like noise which I thought was awkward.  There were some clouds visible, but it was clear enough to where you could see the stars and all.   The video footage I have is unedited, but I did zoom in while filming to get a better view of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be sincere and seemingly sober-minded.  PD));33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
