Triangular Shaped Object with Flashing Lights Flying over Escondido Friday Night Oct9 2009.;2009-10-09 19:30:00;30 Minutes;Triangular Shaped Object with Flashing Lights Flying over Escondido Friday Night Oct 9, 2009. Around 7:30 pm during Cruising Grand, a large group of individuals noticed a triangular shaped object in the sky. At this time I looked up and noticed the same. This object had flashing white lights in what looked like the underside of the craft. These lights formed the triangular shape. There were also some red lights flashing what looked to be above the craft and some blue lights flashing periodically underneath the object. This craft was moving very very slowly towards the east. At one point the object stopped moving and abruptly dropped down what looked to be a couple thousand feet then immediately jumped back up in the sky in a matter of seconds. Everyone was talking and were astonished at this sighting. As a helicopter came to view in the sky, the object vanished.;33.1259360406091;-117.077390862944
It was 10:30 at night when I spotter a grey triangular flying object that was at a very low altitude.;2011-02-24 22:30:00;1 minute;It was 10:30 at night when I spotter a grey triangular flying object that was at a very low altitude. I had just finished a work out in my living room at about 10:30 PM when I went into my restroom to see my progress.  I then looked out a little window in the restroom and saw a strange triangular shaped flying object.  It made no noise and seemed to hoover.  It moved slowly and I just stared in disbelief. When I realized what was going on I went for my cell phone and went outside to record this only took me a few seconds. When i went outside the object was gone.  The following nights I would go and stare out my window to see if it would pass again, but it didn't.  I also felt strange during the nights I felt scared and I could't go to sleep it was unusual.  It felt like someone was watching me, taking me to places.  The memories are very faint, but I do remember feeling strange. Description: Triangular shape with three lights at each end, hovered made no noise, moved slow at first but then vanished, only saw one, was a grey color, very low altitude looked like it was about to hit some houses, ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
