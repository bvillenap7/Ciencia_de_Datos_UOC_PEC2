Similar to a Shooting Star, but not! Brillient Bright Green in color with sparkling long tail.;1998-10-05 20:00:00;At least 10 seconds;Similar to a Shooting Star, but not! Brillient Bright Green in color with sparkling long tail. I just heard you on the radio show, and would like to offer you My Experience with a most elegant sighting. I actually live in Central Washington State, but I was in California at the time visiting my Mother.  The date was specifically October 5th, 1998 and it was in the evening, about 8:00 PM California time, and it was dark. I was in the parking lot at my girlfriend saying good night when her little boy of 10 years old said Look at that! I turned and viewed one of the most elegant things I've ever seen! With my wide span view between the trees I saw very long streak in the sky moving on a horizenal plane. It was moving similar to a shooting star, with an extremely long tail, and it was the most brilliant Green color I've ever seen. The front was much larger and brighter than the trailing edge, and I noticed that it was moving slower that a shooting star, but still a a great speed. Surprisingly, it appeared very low in the sky. (About 20 to 30 degrees above the horizen.) It had a flat trajectory (no movement up or down) and the sight lasted at least more than 10 seconds in clear view. Along the trailing end, which I repeat was very long, there were tiny (but fine) speckles of white glitter like from the a ferry's wand. The actual tail of this thing appeared to be over 20 miles long. It was identical to the one the lady described when you played her voice recording on the radio show. I had a 90 degree clear view horizonally of this thing and it was simply remarkable. As my back was facing the ocean, I viewed this as it was moving from my left to my right side. This means I was facing a easterly direction. (with a little North added) I was actually in Dana Point California one block from the ocean, facing towards the approximate direction of San Antinio Peak which is located about 20 miles NE of Ontairo. (I've done a lot of flying in this area.)  So this thing was coming from... a Northly direction, and going to a Southerly direction. Almost the opposite direction of the Lady's sighting. Now this lady I dicribed above just had her sighting tonight 12/18/98, while my identical sighting in California was on 10/5/98 . Over 2,000 miles of seperation! I am a former Deputy Sheriff and former Police Officer. I also have a Commercial Pilot license, and I know what I see, when I see it. I hope this sighting helps. Thank you for being there!;33.4769;-117.7013

Bright orange fireball in Dana Point, CA, chased by jets.;2018-01-24 01:00:00;5 minutes;Bright orange fireball in Dana Point, CA, chased by jets. At 0100 today, 01/24/18, a bright orb appeared in the sky and immediately disappeared.  Roughly 30 seconds later, it reappeared in the same spot and maintained its position before fading away again.   Another 30 seconds went by and it was down the coast towards Laguna Beach and moving at an accelerated speed and arcing upwards.   Immediately after it disappeared for the final time, helicopters and jets were seen in the night sky where it originally appeared.;33.4769;-117.7013
