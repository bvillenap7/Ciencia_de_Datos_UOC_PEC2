Second Sighting of orange lights over OC;2013-08-23 21:00:00;5-10 minutes;Second Sighting of orange lights over OC The first time I saw these lights was on 8/12/13 when I was on a run by my house in Dana Point.  I then saw the EXACT same thing tonight (8/23/13) when I was on my patio. Here is what both events consisted of... There were a string of orange lights over the ocean traveling south from Laguna Beach towards Dana Point.  The lights were bright at first, a dark orange, definitely not “whitish” like stars or aircraft lights and moved slowly, almost gliding in a non-unison formation.  It sort of resembled someone letting go of balloons with candles in them.  The first time I saw them I actually thought maybe it was some sort of air balloon thing.  They were silent and became dimmer as they appeared to come closer, but that’s assuming they were traveling horizontally along the coast.  They just one by one slowly disappeared one by one, not in any particular order. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.4769;-117.7013
