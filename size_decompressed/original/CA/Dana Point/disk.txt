The brightest thing I've ever seen in the sky other than the sun appeared from the ocean two blocks to my house and I witnessed it at 9 o'clock in the sky at it's closest to me where it's size was the diameter of the sun.  Then, it moved to 11 o'clock in the sky, straight in front of me and backed away and stayed in the same place for approx. 20 minutes as a bright star in a clear blue non-cloudy sky over the ocean.  While clearly other planes that I see every day are bieng vectored to John Wayne airport, that were in the sky at the time.  This was clearly the  most beautiful silver color aircraft I have ever seen.  I can go on and on, but I think that's enough.  Words can't explain it, seeing is believing.  I've also witnessed 20 years ago some other lights in the sky in Illinois.;33.4769;-117.7013
01:15 06/21/08 observed disk shape craft over ocean in Dana Point / Laguna Beach area;2008-06-21 01:15:00;1 minute;01:15 06/21/08 observed disk shape craft over ocean in Dana Point / Laguna Beach area at approximatly 01:15 on 06/21/08 seen off shore in Dana Point, Laguna Beach area a disk shaped object moving back and forth like it was on a pendulam.  When the bottom of the object faced us it had blue lights around it with a red light in the middle.  It moved quickly back and fourth like it was swinging in the air.  Very large and extremly bright when the bottom faced us but barley lite when viewing the side.  It moved back and fourth in an inverted arc and it either went below the building out of view or disappeared.  I have never seen anything like it before so I have to call it a UFO.  I nor my partner could identify it as a plane or craft that we have ever seen.  I work part time as security at a very upscale resort and was on the job when I saw it.  I am also a bank manager as my full time job and a college student.;33.4769;-117.7013
