Triangular object sighted over Dana Point, California.;2000-11-02 19:30:00;30 seconds;Triangular object sighted over Dana Point, California. I saw one UFO traveling south to north roughly parallel to Pacific Coast Highway.  I cannot be sure of the size or the distance but if I had to guess it was up about 1000 feet.  It was triangular shaped with each side, I'm guessing, 30 feet.  The tip areas of the triangle were not pointy but rounded.  There where large circles in each tip.  There were no lights,it was lit only by the ambient light in the area.  It made no sound whatsoever.  It was traveling rapidly but not super fast.  The circular areas were a carbon color in the low light and the interior area appeared to have a light brownish cast.;33.4769;-117.7013
