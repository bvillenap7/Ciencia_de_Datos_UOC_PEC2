It had orange lights all around it and what appeared to be red lights in the middle in the shape of a cross. It was flying at about 3,000 feet then all of a sudden went vertical through the cloud cover very quickly. I've watched planes my whole life as my dad was an Air force fighter pilot and also worked at the Naval air station in Alameda. I've never seen anything like this.;37.7632174999999;-122.2586225
