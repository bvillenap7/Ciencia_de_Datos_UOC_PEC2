A fleet of white circular UFOs over Alameda, CA.;2010-07-11 16:10:00;15 minutes;A fleet of white circular UFOs over Alameda, CA. My wife and I saw a fleet of white circular UFOs flying overhead at around 13,000-15,000 feet over me in formation moving very slowly today, July 11, 2010 at around 16:10 hours.   The formation was more of an long elongated formation.  Some crafts were in a tight formation while other crafts were spread out.  From what I can see, they were too high to be birds and too big to be balloons.  If they were white balloons, they should of been moving south because the wind was blowing from the north this evening at around 10 knots.   This was not a one time occurance in my area.  I usually see one or two during my weekend afternoons when I am usually working on my garden, but never thought of reporting it due to the fact that I don't know what it is.  But this time it was different, I saw 27-30 of this unusual craft moving overhead and the frequency of siting is increasing. I am at a close proximity to Oakland and San Francisco airport and see many planes of deferent make and sizes flying overhead.  I know what planes or helicopters looks like even at high altitude from the shape of the fuselage and wings.  This crafts exhibited no known feature of known aircrafts. I am a laboratory manager for a small Biotechnology company and have training in science.  My wife is an Executive Assistance for a high technology company.  We both now firmly believe there is crafts of unknown origin flying through our airspace.   I would like to purchase a digital video camera soon to film my experiences so that I can share or present solid evidence to other researchers in this field.  I hope we were not the only people who witnessed this amazing event this evening.;37.7632174999999;-122.2586225
