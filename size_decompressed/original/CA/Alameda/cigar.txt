Craft resembling a plane disappears in broad daylight.;2012-05-20 08:35:00;10-15 seconds;Craft resembling a plane disappears in broad daylight. This craft that appeared very much at first to be a plane, until I noticed it had no wings.  Knowing that the first thing to do when witnessing a UFO is to get another person to see it, I asked my wife to verify the craft had no wings, which she agreed could not be seen in the time we were 'allowed' to view it.   The craft was traveling N-NE over Oakland, Calif., at an approximate angle of 50 degrees and climbing, the same trajectory as numerous planes we notice taking off from the Oakland airport daily.  What made this sighting unique:  While still attempting to verify the lack of wings 100%, the object passed behind a building as we were driving, and we waited for it to come out on the other side to continue viewing, but it NEVER RE-APPEARED.  I scanned the entire sky when clear of the building obstruction, the object was nowhere to be seen in the sky, which is an impossibility given the physics and elevation of the flightpath.;37.7632174999999;-122.2586225
