Bright white elongated diamond shape in night sky.;2014-01-27 01:00:00;3-5 seconds;Bright white elongated diamond shape in night sky Just finishing up laundry downstairs late (early morning) at night.  Was just about to go up the backstairs when I couldn't help but notice an extremely bright white light.  It was in the shape of an elongated diamond.  I stood still and watched for about 3-5 seconds before it seemed to slowly cloak itself and then it was gone.  It did not make a sound at any time. I ran up my back stairs and called out for my fiance' since I was scared out of my mind.  We also had to deal with our neighbors barking dog from 1:30- 2:30 AM and my young child who woke up from the insane barking.  I thought that I could explain it away thinking well maybe I just saw a plane etc but I know that is not what I saw and couldn't go back to sleep until 3AM being comforted by my fiance'.;37.7632174999999;-122.2586225
