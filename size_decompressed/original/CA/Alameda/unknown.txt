Two red-lighted objects with red lights flowing down from them spotted over San Francisco Bay.;2013-09-26 20:55:00;2 minutes;Two red-lighted objects with red lights flowing down from them spotted over San Francisco Bay. At approximately 8:55 PM on Thursday, September 26 I saw two U.F.O.s about 45 degrees up from the horizon over the San Francisco Bay from Alameda, CA. They had two bright red lights on top and then a shower of red lights falling from them like rain. The lights coming down looked like jellyfish tentacles and came down approximately three times the height of the bright red lights at the top.  Looking at these two objects made me feel like I needed glasses. The lights coming down would not stay in focus. I could not see the shape of the objects. They were too far away and it was too dark. If you happened to glance up, you would probably think they were regular commercial planes off in the distance.  After watching them move slowly toward the south across the sky, one of them turn into a small white light and disappeared. The other continued to move out of view.;37.7632174999999;-122.2586225
Saw green flashing or lightning twice in a minute.  I woke up and saw 2 flashes.;2016-07-07 00:40:00;1 minute (maybe more);Saw green flashing or lightning twice in a minute.  I woke up and saw 2 flashes. I was sleeping and I woke up at the exact moment I saw green lightning (or a green flash) coming from the bay window over my head.  I was startled because I had seen this same EXACT thing last year.  It was green flashing or lightning.   I waited for maybe 10 seconds... wide away at this point and saw it again, clear as day... bright green flashing, with a hot white center. It seemed to be right over Alameda...or even my house.   I have waited a day for any news of power outages (down transformers that could've blown... no storms at all though). I have tried to find news of meteor showers in the area, and no info is available.  It's just an eerie mystery and it has me perplexed.  Also, it was silent..... both times (and my window is open for a breeze) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
