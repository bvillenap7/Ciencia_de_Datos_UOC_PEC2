I was relaxing on the beach overlooking the San Francisco Bay south of the Oakland San Francisco Bridge. Looking toward the north west I observed a small red light at approximately 30,000 ft. It was heading basically toward San Francisco. Initially I assumed it to be a Navigation light of a large plane. I assumed it was coming in for a landing at San Franisco Airport. It began to lose altitude and surprisingly it came toward me and in front of me across the bay at a distance of perhaps a mile. Again I assumed it to be perhaps a helicopter now although to me it was still a round red ball of brilliant light. To my surprise it suddenly dove right into the bay and the light went out and whatever it was disappeared completely. It's speed at impact must have been aproximately 100 mph. I called FAA and the San Francisco tower but no one appeared interested. I gave up. There was no accounts of any crashes in the next few days and to this day I still do not know what it was. Ley Line' fire ball? UFO? I have still the record and sketch I prepared ewhich is in my log for 1980. I was stationed at Alameda NAS at the time. There was another 'situation' which occurred to both me and my wife several years previously. This time in Missouri, in Rolla, and I will provide this report seperately.

Small orange ball of fire floating upwards in Alameda, Ca.;2012-05-08 21:15:00;10 minutes;Small orange ball of fire floating upwards in Alameda, Ca. My wife and I saw a small orange ball of fire floating upwards, from NW, into the sky.  Then floated NE, rising higher and higher, into the sky.  There was no sound of any propulsion.  We took a couple of pictures and it appeared like a small grey cylinder with a black dot in the center.  It appeared like a small ball of fire to our eyes.  We noticed it dropping a misty substance.;37.7632174999999;-122.2586225
