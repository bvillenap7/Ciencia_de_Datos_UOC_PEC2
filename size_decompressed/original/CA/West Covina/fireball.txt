Blue Fireball like UFO seen at night in West Covina summer of 2012;2012-06-19 22:30:00;???;Blue Fireball like UFO seen at night in West Covina summer of 2012 I saw a UFO last night around 10:30 driving down the 10 fwy in West Covina.  The sky was foggy, you couldn't see the stars.  I saw something fly above me so I leaned forward and saw a blue sphere-like ufo. It was very fast and I know the cars around me on both sides of the freeway saw it.  I had seen a similar object like that in Montebello in 2008.;34.0635123123122;-117.898575675677
3 red fireballs over Los Angeles during 4 th of July festivities observing us.;2012-07-04 20:45:00;20 minutes;3 red fireballs over Los Angeles during 4 th of July festivities observing us. Today July 4, 2012 amidst the beginning of our fireworks celebrations I went outside to take photos when I noticed a large ball of fire near my house it was large enough to make me a bit nervous, it seemed to be trying to blend in with the fireworks as it was only interested in watching. I grabbed my camera to take a photo when all of a sudden as if it knew what I was thinking flashed further back into the sky.  I flashed away several photos and then it was joined by two other ufos that just faded into view. They watched for a while and then they all faded out together.  They are watching us, something is going to happen sooner or later. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
