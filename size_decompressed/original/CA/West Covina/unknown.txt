white, caterpillar contrails over Los Angeles County;2004-10-02 18:20:00;10 minutes;white, caterpillar contrails over Los Angeles County I witnessed white contrails in the eastern part of the sky shortly before sundown.  The sky was clear.  The trail was visible with the naked eye.  It caught my attention because it seemed to be a chain of spheres instead of a streak of smoke.  After about a minute I began observing with binoculars (Le Gran, 7x35, model K303, field 578ft. at 1000yds.)  Through them I was able to discern worm-like movement, though not the actual object.  After about 10 minutes I was unable to see the trail as it headed toward the western horizon.;34.0635123123122;-117.898575675677
A bright orange flickering UFO moved from left to right over the 10 freeway in West Covina before turning and flying back/upward.;2020-10-02 23:29:00;5 minutes;A bright orange flickering UFO moved from left to right over the 10 freeway in West Covina before turning and flying back/upward. I was driving through West Covina toward Los Angeles and to the left of the 10 East, I saw a bright orange, flickering light. It looked like fire, so I thought maybe it was the flame at the top of a refinery stack, but as I got closer, I realized the orb was hovering.  There weren’t any visible stars (due to smog and light pollution) so it had to be hanging low to be that visible. The light faded out momentarily, only to reappear 30 seconds later. It slowly moved towards the right side of the freeway, spending a good minute over the center of the freeway.  As I got closer, I could see it better it appeared to have multiple lights (I could identify at least 2 or 3) that seemed to be stacked vertically (but not symmetrically). In the video I took on my iPhone, you can see the lights flicker, but can’t make out the shape beyond an orb.  Once it reached the right side of the freeway, about 5 minutes later, it was no longer flickering. Then, after about a minute, it U-turned, moving quickly from right to left and slightly upward, like a backwards Nike swoosh. As it did, the light began to turn off as iff on a dimmer, although once it was out, the dark object was still visible over the bright clouds as it flew away. As it did, a faint red light flashed in its trail, but it was hard to tell if it was from the object itself or something that the object emitted (I am leaning towards the latter).;34.0635123123122;-117.898575675677
