Oblong shaped UFO with glowing underbelly sighted over Los Angeles area – no explanation.;2010-12-27 18:15:00;about 2 minutes;Oblong shaped UFO with glowing underbelly sighted over Los Angeles area – no explanation. On December 27, 2010 at approximately 6:15 pm PST my wife and I were in our backyard in West Covina, CA (about 22 miles east of downtown Los Angeles).  It was a very clear evening and I was looking up at the night sky.  In the southwest sky there was a light from what appeared to be a planet and to the right and above the planet I noticed another odd, bright light.  It was oblong in shape and had a glowing white oblong light on its underside.  It was moving at a slow pace in a northerly direction.  It seemed to be moving too slow to be an airplane and it seemed to high and too big to be a helicopter.  I pointed it out to my wife and she also saw it and couldn’t explain it.  We watched it for about 2 minutes and then it suddenly disappeared.  We didn’t see it fly off.  It was just gone.;34.0635123123122;-117.898575675677
Star like Orbs, seen during the day;2011-04-05 11:30:00;12 minutes;Star like Orbs, seen during the day Was outside taking out the trash and saw a tiny white star orb flying up.   As I tracked it up there was a bigger Star orb.  It was just hovering there as 3 smaller Orbs would fly in formation then split up do aerial acrobats.   The larger orb would start dimming the glow very bright in a rhythmic way.  Almost seemed like the 3 smaller orbs would orbit around the big, kind of like a mother ship or something.   They were all moving from the south west to the North east towards the San Gabriel Mountains.   Just didnt seem like anything man made, and the smaller orbs moving in uniform, doing 90 degree turns and almost appearing to stop on a dime.   Very fascinating.;34.0635123123122;-117.898575675677
