ufo west covina, ca;2010-04-24 13:00:00;3 hours;ufo west covina, ca At about 1:00PM on 4-24-10, I looked into the sky at a 2 man airplane when i noticed right above it was this very small, white, ball like object. I was at the skate park at the time of the incident so I pointed the object out to a couple of freinds.  We kept following it with our eyes and another object of the same shape popped up out of nowhere right next to the first.  We were in awe and were getting exited that the whole park of about 20 people wittnessed the same sight we were seeing.  We kept following the objects when more and more of the same objects were appearing. Some were close to eachother and some were spread out.  About an 1 hour and a half one of the objects went stationary while two objects came near the stationary object and went into a triangle formation. The formation was stationary for about 15 minutes and then flew away faster than anything Ive ever seen.  Soon after that an airforce jet flew by without a smoke trail and sound.
