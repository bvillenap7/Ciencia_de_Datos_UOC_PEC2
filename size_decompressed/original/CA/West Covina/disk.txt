He directed our attention to the object, which made no sound.  As it rose from the North, it continued it's path in a Southerly direction.  The speed at which it was traveling was that of a satellite.  It traveled about the length of the big dipper, stopped, then proceeded in a North Easterly direction. It didn't turn, it stopped and changed direction.  Initially, it was a reddish color, but when it began travelling Northeast, it's color changed to a grayish color.  Throughout the siting the object was not focusable, it was blurry, but it did seem to have a saucer shape.  As it travelled Northeast, about half the distance of the big dipper, it faded completely from our view.  My sister-in-law was a sceptic, until she witnessed this siting with the three of us.  This was a bonafied UFO.  If anyone else witnessed this, please document it on this website.;34.0635123123122;-117.898575675677
Cloud-like saucer shape with top and bottom domes having flashing lights moving slowly at low altitude.;2003-11-10 18:30:00;5 minutes;Cloud-like saucer shape with top and bottom domes having flashing lights moving slowly at low altitude. Craft approached from North West and then proceeded East along 10 fwy.  Craft appeared cloud-like in saucer shape outline with domes top and bottom approximately 50 to 100 feet across.  There were flashing aircraft type lights on top and bottom of opposing domes with a dark narrow slit near top dome.  Craft moved very slowly at low altitude no more than one-hundred fifty feet from my hill-top viewpoint.  During the event, I felt very calm and was not aware of any detectable noise from the craft.  This was my first encounter with a UFO sighting.;34.0635123123122;-117.898575675677
