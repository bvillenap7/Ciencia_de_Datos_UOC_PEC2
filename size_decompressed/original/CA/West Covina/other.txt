Around February 2002, my son, ((name deleted)) looked nearly straight up in the early morning sky in a roughly south east direction from his back yard in West Covina, California. He spotted a small single bright oblong object with a more rounded dome shape at top center.  He took a photo of it which is available.   It remained in one spot for about ten minutes.  He left and came back several minutes later and it was gone.;34.0635123123122;-117.898575675677
