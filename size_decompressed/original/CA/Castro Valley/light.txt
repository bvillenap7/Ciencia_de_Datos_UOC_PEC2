Object travels SLOWLY over Castro Valley, California;2004-01-20 18:30:00;2 minutes;Object travels SLOWLY over Castro Valley, California An object traveling extremely high but super slow, traveled over our heads last night heading North East. There were no blinking lights, and after it past me the light was just as bright as if it were headed toward me. As it past us, it seemed to stop for a brief moment, then DISAPPEARED.  The object made 0 noise, and had actually at one point made a subtle change in direction, as no aircraft can do.  Shortly after it disappeared, multiple military aircraft flew overhead. I know this because of no commercial airliner would travel side by side at supersonic speeds at roughly 40,000+ feet.  We actually filmed that final 60 or so seconds of this, and if needed we will email this video clip to you. ((NUFORC Note:  We would like to look at the video, and we will request clips from the witness.  PD));37.7056285714285;-122.0693
Object moving across CA sky Jan 4th 2005 7:10PM;2005-01-04 19:10:00;30 seconds;Object moving across CA sky Jan 4th 2005 7:10PM As me and my wife were driving down the road.  I saw a light moving across the sky,  I pointed it out to my wife.  She saw it.  Said  Big deal, it's a plane.  I said, It has no blinking lights.  We live in the Bay Area and have many planes in the sky.  But this didn't look like a plane.  It moved in what I think was westerly direction.  And reminded of a missle launch from Vandenberg that a saw back in 96 or 97.  So I like to know if anyone else saw it too.  I've seen satelites and shooting stars move across the sky and this was neither.  I suspect that it was man-made.  If some knows for sure. Please let me know.

Fast moving bright Light leaves contrail;2005-01-08 20:10:00;2 Minutes;Fast moving bright Light leaves contrail My son and I were driving home from Walgreens Store, when we both saw a light in the sky appear. The light swooped down, leaving behind it a bright contrail, that quickly disappeared. As the light approached us, we saw that it's movement was erratic. It moved in a zig zag pattern, left to right. The light then accelerated and went straight up, leaving another misty-fog like contrail behind it. It never made a sound. My son had jumped out of the car when we first noticed it, as I had stopped the car to watch this event. The object must have been about a mile away.  I have seen other strange objects over the years, and have even reported some sightings on this sight, but this is probably the most significant event I have witnessed to date. the movement, the contrail, the acceleration. All of these were mind blowing.;37.7056285714285;-122.0693
Moving from the west in a south or south east direction - small single white object dimmed and disappeared;2011-08-31 21:22:00;Approx 5 min;Moving from the west in a south or south east direction - small single white object dimmed and disappeared At approx 9:20 pm tonight,I was out front on our driveway waiting for my wife to come home from work. As usual while out front, even though we have a street light in front of the house and there's a lot of light from Castro Valley and the surrounding cities like Hayward, San Leandro, San Lorenzo and Oakland, you can still see most of the brighter stars in the sky - like the Big Dipper, Orion's Belt and some of the Zodiac signs.  There's been a couple times over the last several months that I've seen something strange, but I am not about to say it was a UFO - as I was alone with my dog and I know it was not a meteor or a plane.  At any given time you can see on an average of about 7 to 8 aircraft at any given time in different parts of the sky around the SF Bay Area, most have just their navigational lights on and a few occasionally have their landing lights on. Tonight, like before, I was looking up towards the west (approx 264 degrees) and I saw that I thought was a bright star or possibly be a planet, then I looked down and saw my wife's car coming down the street and turn and start to park out on the street. While she was doing this I returned and looked to the west at this object but it wasn't a star, it was small like one of them but it was more of a bright white color and appeared closer than the normal stars, and it was moving sorta towards our general direction (which I later determined to be towards the south or south east). As my wife walked up the drive way I didn't turn to look at her, instead I kept my eye on the object and it was continuing to move - not real real fast, but appeared to be maybe the speed of a plane or a little faster. When she asked what I was staring at, I told her I don't know that that is up there, I told her I didn't see any navigational lights on it and she looked up and with her typical doubt she said it's probably a plane. I was just about to agree when it started to get dimmer, like someone hit a switch and it dimmed real low and you could still see it but there was a definate difference in brightness.  I told her look, it's getting dimmer and as we both watched it seemed like it was going up and got dimmer and then totally disappeared. We both looked for about 15 to 20 seconds trying to find it but it was not there - this was at approx 9:25pm. She then said mayby it WAS a UFO. I know it was NOT a plane, the only plane that I have seen that would do something similar to his is the U2 Spy Plane and Nasa still uses them, Ive seen them take off numerous times at the old Navy Moffett Field in San Mateo County over the years - saw one not more than mayby 1 month ago. I know it was NOT a meteor, I've seen hundreds, if not maybe a thousand, over the years in the US, Korea, and Germany, I've seen them do all kinds of different things but they do NOT go up!;37.7056285714285;-122.0693
10 separate red / orange lights - possible UFO - appear and disappear over an approximately 10 minute period.;2012-12-12 21:20:00;10-12 minutes;10 separate red / orange lights - possible UFO - appear and disappear over an approximately 10 minute period. At approximately 21:20 while waiting outside I happened to look towards the South West (225 degrees on my cell phone compass)and noticed 2 orange-ish red-ish lights in the far distant sky above some local shops.  I could not tell how far distant but assumed that they were planes coming into the SF Bay Area from the Pacific Ocean area, but that they were in a position in the sky where passenger planes do not normally appear.  I could not even try to guess how far they were apart but using the finger method they appeared to be approximately 1 1/2 fingers apart in the sky.   As I watched, the first one appeared if it was traveling slowly and started to turn to the right and climb higher. It eventually disappeared and I thought that maybe it was a plane that had disappeared into some distant clouds.  I watched the remaining visible light and followed the same path and then disappeared in the almost exact same place.  I know absolutely that these are not any known aircraft as every night while I wait for my wife to come home outside I continually watch the skys and watch all kinds of aircraft, both near and extremely far away fly by.  You can ALWAYS see their navigational markers flashing but these lights I saw tonight did not blink at all, no red/green/white blinking navigational lights anywhere, just the same steady orange-ish red-ish color. Approximately 3 or 4 minutes after the first 2 disappeared, 3 more appeared coming from the same direction.  These though, when I first saw them appeared to be a brighter red-ish color and then dimmed to the same color as the others.  These were also approx 1 1/2 finger apart and followed the same path and disappeared in the same area as the first to.  Once all 3 of these disappeared 2 more appeared approximately 3 minutes later and again, followed the same path and disappeared in the same place. I thought there was a cloud or something in that area and about a minute later I saw a distant plane (with blinking nav lights) fly from my right to the left (approx north to south) in the same area and distance and it was completely visable till it disappeared far to my left and far far south from where those lights disappeared so I know there were no clouds in that area. At this time it was 9:26 PM and about that time my wife came home from work. Just as she exited her car and was walking up the driveway, one more appeared again, I pointed it out to her and at first she thought it was a plane and I said no, just watch. 2 more appeared and she watched while the first one disappeared in the same area again and then went inside.  I waited and saw that the other 2 followed the same route and disappeared in the same place again.;37.7056285714285;-122.0693

It was a bright greenish color, moved extremely fast from horizon to horizon.  My guess is it was flying about an altitude of 5000ft.   It flew from one side of the sky to the other side in about 2 seconds, then did a 45 degree turn and took off over the Pacific Ocean.;37.7056285714285;-122.0693
