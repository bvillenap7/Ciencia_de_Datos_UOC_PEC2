On the way home one night I saw something out the passenger window of a friends car, I said nothing in fear of being thought of as crazy, and then the driver asked me to look behind us and tell him what I saw, I said you tell me what you see and I'll tell you if it's what I saw.  We saw something that looked like a boxkite it had lights on the top and bottom corners of it giving it a rectangle shape, short ends at top and bottom.  We decided to follow and get better idea what it was,got to the end of the street and it went to the East toward the canyon and before we could turn left it was in the west over the hospital, tallest building in the city at the time.  We were in awe! that was almost 2 miles in a flash.  We knew we could not keep up with it and chose to go home. I remember nothing after that not even getting home, I still can't remember getting home, or anything for that matter! This thing moved in a way I've never seen before or since, it could just stop and hover, silently too, it could change direction immediately.  Wish I could remember it dissapearing or us leaving to go home, I was sitting in a car at the corner of a main intersection of town watching this thing then it was next day and I woke up at home in bed?!;37.7056285714285;-122.0693
