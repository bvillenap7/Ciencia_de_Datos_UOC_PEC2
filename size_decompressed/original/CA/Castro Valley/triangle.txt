There was a red triangular spacecraft with black wings on the rear.;2007-06-16 22:00:00;15 seconds;There was a red triangular spacecraft with black wings on the rear. Observer is 5'8 165 pounds, male, brown hair, green eyes. Observer is disabled and to this date I still see UFO's that are not in the same shape. They look like they are camoflouged in the atmosphere. They look like a cloud soaring and from time to time a little white star that comes out of it that is a craft. I have been seeing this on a daily basis. They are real hard to see. There was no sound and was 35 feet above my head.  The ones I am seeing now are during the day I see little white puppy clouds soaring and a little white star coming out. This is on a daily basis. At night when this is observed, sometimes they are dark colored and sometimes they are light. They are very hard to see.

On Mar. 17, 2016, 22:40 hrs., I observed an object crossing over hwy 580 E near Castro Valley, Ca.  This object was flying at the normal speed, relative to an average small airplane or a helicopter, until its appearance above the hwy 580 E and hovered, then moved slowly across the road and went over the Eden Canyon Hills toward the opposite side of the road from north toward south side.  The object turned side way toward the down side of the hill and I noticed this object was a black triangular shape craft about the same size or bigger than a commercial airliner or a military craft KC 130.   This object had a large circular red light in the center with a strobe white light on one corner, and blinking red and blue lights on the different corners.
