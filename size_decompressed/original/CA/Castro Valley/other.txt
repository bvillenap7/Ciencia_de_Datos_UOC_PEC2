I was stunned by a hovering shape in the sky.It was hard to make out the shape but it was circular with a spinning red light, and covered with lights. It was illuminating beneath almost like the cars with the neon lights below. It was just hovering there, I almost wrecked my car twice because I could just not take my eyes off it. It was just hovering there! I felt fear, my heart started pounding in my chest and I felt like I couldn't breathe and almost broke a sweat. I would like to know what it was that I saw because I have never seen or heard of anything like this before!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
