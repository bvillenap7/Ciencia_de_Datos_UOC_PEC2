Shiny white object flys silently over our home;2005-03-21 09:30:00;2 Minutes;Shiny white object flys silently over our home My friend and I were standing on our front porch talking, when I noticed a strange WHITE object hovering in the sky over a neighboring town. I ran in the house to get my binoculors, and when I got back it was closer than before. I watched the object for about a minute, making no erratic movements. I got such a good look at the object I made a drawing of the object on the computer, which I will send when I am done writing this.  The object did not glow, but it was shiny, and looked like it was made from some really polished plastic. It made no noise, and it appeared to have some sort of protrusion at the top, but I never got a very good look at that, since it mostly right above me during observation. The object accelerated quite rapidly and was gone in a blink of an eye after that two minutes. My friend got a look at it and he even said it looked like a giant flying egg.  The object was about the size of a small plane, sans wings, in estimation. I've never seen such a shiny object like that before.;37.7056285714285;-122.0693
