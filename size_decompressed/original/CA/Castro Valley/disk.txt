circular UFO( bell hat shape ) seen on hwy 580 castro valley, CA  8:10 pm in front of full moon.;2008-02-22 20:10:00;4 seconds;circular UFO( bell hat shape ) seen on hwy 580 castro valley, CA  8:10 pm in front of full moon. Last night was a full moon rising over castro valley east bay, CA, the sky was clear of clouds around the moon, driving up on hwy 580 , as you drive down the 580 from castro valley into livermoore valley was an incredible view.  As I was and other cars decending the fwy a (felt hat shaped) circular black silhouette of a craft was seen right in the middle of the moon, it was a beautiful view as it was very clearly outlined, the UFO silhouette was black in front of the moon.  It had no blinking lights on it (that is why it didn't look like a plane or a helicopter) it was not blinkin on side wings on sides nor bottom nor front nor roof and was totally black against the backdrop of the moon.  It stayed in front of the moon about 3 seconds then took off so fast it disapeared in the night sky.;37.7056285714285;-122.0693
Saucer flying low with bright flickering lights.;2010-12-23 20:25:00;5-10 minutes;Saucer flying low with bright flickering lights. I was driving east bound on I-580 when I looked to the left, but slightly in front of me, and saw a saucer flying relatively low over the hills.  It had several bright lights of all different colors flickering from it. It was way too low and big to be any type of aircraft that I have ever seen. I continued to drive to my destination (my moms house) and immediately told her to come outside and see it.  It was flying very slow, almost like it was floating.  My mom, sister, and dad went outside and saw it as it continued to slowly move over the hills east bound.  After about 10 minutes from when I first spotted it, i lost sight of it behind a tree.  I then got back in my car to follow the object and as soon as I got to a spot where I should have been able to see it again, it was gone.  I drove around the area for over 20 minutes looking for it and there was no sight of it.  At the speed it was traveling and its location, it is virtually impossible for it to have just disappeared. The object was VERY big, I would compare it to the size of 3 blimps put together.  What was most interesting about it was its very obvious saucer-like shape and very bright flickering lights.   I have never seen anything like this before.;37.7056285714285;-122.0693
