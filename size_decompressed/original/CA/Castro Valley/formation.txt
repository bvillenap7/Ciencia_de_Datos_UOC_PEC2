5 to 7 orange lights seen floating low in the sky slowy fade out.;2011-10-31 19:20:00;5 minutes;5 to 7 orange lights seen floating low in the sky slowy fade out. On the night of 10/31/2011 at approximately 7:20pm, from my front yard looking north I observed 5 to 7 floating orange balls of light.  I ran inside and grabbed my binoculars to get a better look. All but one light ascended down below my plain of view behind houses and trees.  I watched the one remaining light slowly float upward and fade out.  The entire event lasted around 5 minutes.  Behind some of the lights I could see the ridge of eucalyptus trees above Lake Chabot some 5 miles away and not higher than 1,000 feet in elevation.  My mother who was with me also saw the lights, as well as at least 3 trick or treaters who were filling the street in this residential neighborhood this Halloween evening.  I could also see a helicopter flying back and forth between my position and the orange lights. It was possibly just a routine traffic reporter over the freeway, but the pilot must have seen the objects. They were a deep orange, darker than air traffic lights that ! are common in the bay area of California with multiple airports nearby. The lights shone like flames. I would place there position to be right above the Lake Chabot area low in the sky possibly the size of cars.;37.7056285714285;-122.0693
