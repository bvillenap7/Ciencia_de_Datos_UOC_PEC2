It was slowly moving from the north down to the south.  It took about 15 minutes for it to get directly over my head before I lost it.   My estimate was that it was around 6,000'.  It was moving around in a circular (counter clockwise) motion.  The object seems to show some color (red/green) in some areas.   At the mid section of the cone was the densest where it extended up to a rounded point.  Bottom had a thin straight rod hanging down.   There were no lights on it or sound made by it. At first I thought it was a funny looking drone but the movement suggested it was not.  Then I thought it could be a clump of balloons.  I could not rule that out 100%. The object did not deviate from its trajectory before I lost sight of it.;37.7056285714285;-122.0693
