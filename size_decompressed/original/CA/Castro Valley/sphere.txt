Sighting over the hills in Castro Valley;2004-05-15 14:00:00;1 minute;Sighting over the hills in Castro Valley I was outside playing around with my new binoclulars/digital camera combo, and took a few shots of an airplane passing by. After a few seconds of viewing the plane, I noticed a black dot in the sky above the plane. It danced around for a minute, and then disappeared. Before it disappeared, I snapped a few shots. Unfortunately the pictures came out pretty poorly, but I did manage to get a shot with plane and the dot in the view. I could see the object more clearly in person than what the photo reveals.  It was perfectly round, and black, and moved in a darting fashion. At first I thought I was watching a balloon, but it moved too fast in too many directions, then zipped off to the south in a split second.  I got one good usable picture, and would love to send it to you. I bought the camera/binoculars due to the high sighting frequency I have been having in this area. This is about the fourth sighting in the month of May for myself and my son. One evening about a week ago, we were awakened to a loud vibrating sound, which thought was an earthquake. When we ran out to the porch, we saw two lighted oval shaped objects steaking across the sky at unbelievable speeds. We also saw a UFO/craft flying over the Army Base in Dublin, CA that appeared to be shaped like an egg and was bright white.  I will keep my eyes on the sky, and tonight I plan to go UFO hunting with my son up in the hills. If I see something, I will report it.;37.7056285714285;-122.0693
