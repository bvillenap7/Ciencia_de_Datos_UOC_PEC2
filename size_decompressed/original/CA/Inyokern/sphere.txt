Huge, sparking edged Black Sphere viewed near Inyokern... perhaps 40 seconds or more, flying a straight line.;1971-06-30 21:00:00;~40 seconds;Huge, sparking edged Black Sphere viewed near Inyokern... perhaps 40 seconds or more, flying a straight line. My Fiancee and I were driving North on a country road near Inyokern, California, at night it was very dark.  This area is the Mojave Desert, with very good visibility in the night sky.  We observed a large black round object coming toward us from the North, initially North of the hills around Little Lake, perhaps 20 to 25 miles or more  to the North.  The black object only was visible due to burning sparks which clearly outlined its edge, it appeared perfectly round with a size as big or larger than the Moon. I pulled the car off the road, and got out to stand in front of the car.  She stayed in the car. The object came overhead, still retaining the perfect round shape, the sparking specks still illuminating it very clearly.  In my memory, I believe it looked maybe twice as large as the Moon.  Because it still appeared perfectly round, I believe it was spherical, not flat.  There was no sound, yet to be burning or sparking around its edge, it had to be in Earth's atmosphere. The object continued South until it disappeared over the hills heading toward L.A..  I would estimate the time for its visible flight of maybe 50 to 70 miles, or more, start to finish, as perhaps 30 to 40 seconds, as I had time to stop the car, get out and move to the front, and watch it pass overhead and vanish to the South. Either on the news or in the L.A. Times, the next day, there was some information it had been seen by L.A. residents heading out over the Ocean.
