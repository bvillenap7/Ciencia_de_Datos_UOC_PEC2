Conjoined formation of shape changing spheres crosses sky;2000-05-28 00:20:00;30 sec.;Conjoined formation of shape changing spheres crosses sky I was poolside at the Super 8 Motel in Fresno smoking a cigar before going up to my room to turn in for the evening. I was attending the annual Country Western and Swing Dance Festival held at the Radisson Hotel a block away. There was a gentle breeze blowing from the North and the temperature was around 75 degrees.  I had been sitting in a lounge chair for nearly an hour when I decided it was time to finish up. As I rose I noticed an oblong sausage shaped dull orange light quickly pop up from behind a large bank building North of me in the downtown Fresno area. It looked like a large lumpy sausage  shaped balloon. That made no sense at all so I continued to watch it with suspicion. It rose to about 30 degrees in the night sky and no longer appeared to have the dusky illumination that caught my eye. It now appeared to be light gray and very shadowy as it approached and came even with me as I viewed it due West. This is where the description gets really weird. I have had sightings of structured craft before but nothing, never even like this, nor have I heard of anything like this. As it was due West at this time I asked myself, What the hell am I looking at?. It appeared to be a string of conjoined spheres each one pushing the next one along in an undulating formation where the one on the end would circle around and pop in at the front.  In disbelief I looked more closely and saw the spheres form into an angular formation with soft white vertices. It crossed the western sky in a smooth straight glide while continuing all this strange activity and was lost from sight at about a 45 degree inclination. The objects path spanned roughly 90 degrees of arc across the sky.  This all took place in about 30 secs. The object was as big as my thumb from tip to first knuckle at arm's distance (1.5). There was absolute silence and there was no air craft seen during the time I was out there.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Triangular light pattern over Fresno CA;2003-04-11 20:10:00;20 minutes;Triangular light pattern over Fresno CA One large very bright leading light fairly round in shape heading in a south west direction was trailed by one smaller fairly round light and to the right side of the large object were two small very bright rounded lights . These last two small lights were what appeared to be exactly parallel to each other. This formation was shaped almost triangular, but there was no noticeable connection between the lights, such as any support or structure. It is hard to judge the speed of these lights although they never changed formation the entire time they were visable to us, no change of color or shape of lights or blinking or fading in brightness. Also in comparison to visable stars this night , these lights appeared to be quite a bit larger , even the smallest lights in this formation were approximately 2 times larger than the stars visible to us.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
15-20 flying formation objects seen from Fresno, CA;2005-09-29 12:00:00;10-15 minutes;15-20 flying formation objects seen from Fresno, CA Me and one coworker witnessed several (15-20) very high flying objects in the east sky from Fresno CA. These objects seemed round shaped and moved extremely fast. Some were in perfect formation in groups of 3 and 5. Two formations were a straight up lines in the sky, and one formation of 5 was a flat line pattern across the sky. Visibility was a very clear blue sky a few minutes after noon when the sightings occurred. The objects would often move in various directions and in unusual patterns before coming together in a line formation. Some flew at speeds like shooting stars across the sky until out of range from our sight. Another flew very fast and stopped suddenly. A few minutes latter another coworker came to our location. We told him what we had just seen, and he laughed at us. Approx. 30 seconds latter one object was very visible in the sky and I pointed it out to him. He saw it and replied something like wow what is that darn thing?. I'm sure I will be looking at the sky's more often.

A linear object with 3 bright lights, flew about 10 feet over our truck while traveling N on I 5.;2011-07-17 02:35:00;1-2 Minutes;A linear object with 3 bright lights, flew about 10 feet over our truck while traveling N on I 5. While traveling north bound on Interstate 5, approximately 30 miles SE of Fresno, a linear object with three bright lights (Two on the end and one in the middle) approached our truck, containing six passengers.  When we first saw it, the linear object was around 500 yards away.   Five of the passengers, including me, saw the formation of lights continuing to fly towards our truck. During this time, the object rotated similar to a plane that has stalled.  We were confused and somewhat scared as to what this object is.  It headed straight towards our truck where it flew about 10-20 feet above us.  It was close enough to where the driver, and the two front passengers, one of which was me, ducked and screamed.   While continuing to drive, we watched behind us as the three bright lights lifted up and dove into the ground and then back up again.  The bright lights spun and rotated until it finally disappeared.   The object was about 30 feet long.   Keep in mind that it wasnt until afterwards we realized that it made absulutely no sound when it passed over our truck.   And the compass on our truck didnt work after the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  This report arrived just before our posting of newly received reports, which will occur on the afternoon of Sunday, July 17, 2011.  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent and objective, in his description of the event.  We have requested that he have at least one of the other witnesses submit reports, as well.  PD));36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
UFOs seen near the intersection of Hwy. 41 and Avenue 12 north of Fresno, CA;2011-10-05 22:30:00;20 minutes;UFOs seen near the intersection of Hwy. 41 and Avenue 12 north of Fresno, CA UFOs seen near Hwy 41 and Avenue 12 north of Fresno, CA  One mother and two teenage boys were driving north of Fresno, California on Highway 41 at approximately 10:30 PM on October 5, 2011.  One of the boys sighted a swarm of about ten (10) fuzzy white orbs zig-zagging through and about the clouds in the overcast sky just east of the intersection of Highway 41 and Avenue 12 north of Fresno, CA.  They watched these &quotfuzzy&quot white lights for about five-minutes as they turned west onto Avenue 12 toward Madera, CA.  As they drive west, the boys encouraged the mother to turn the car around, which she did, to return to the intersection.  The mother then turned north onto Highway 41 while  they all watch the lights swarm around through the clouds.  Just east of the same intersection is a barn and many ongoing acres of open farmland/ranchland.  According to the boys, some of these fuzzy white lights had a small star-like center to them.  Additionally, on the ground, to the viewing-right (e.g., south) of the reference barn (as see! n from the intersection of Highway 41 and Avenue 12) there was also seen a large triangle-shape (tip of triangle pointing upwards).  This object had blinking white lights at each tip of the large triangle.  The mother turned the vehicle around, from north to south, on Hwy 41 and drove home.  They do not have any explanation as to what they saw in the distance that night.  There is a creek that runs north to south near this area.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Formation of four lights traveling at an apparent fast rate of speed silently across the night sky.;2012-08-24 02:30:00;4 seconds;Formation of four lights traveling at an apparent fast rate of speed silently across the night sky. From Fresno California, on August 24 th, 2012, I woke up needing some water and I decided to go outside and check the clear star lit sky, I was hoping to see some falling stars but instead I saw a UFO (or four of them)!   It was almost straight up in the early morning sky (2:30 AM) a bit to the South sky, I saw a fast moving line four lights (about equal to the stars that were out) traveling from West to the East, from one side of the sky to the other ending in their disappearing behind the tree line.  They were spaced far apart but clearly together.  The line was side by side not in a follow the leader row, the line was perfectly straight, each light was constant, not blinking and without color of any kind, the speed was difficult to tell now knowing the distance but it was very fast and took about 4 seconds to go all across the sky.  There was sound at all. This is the first time I have seen such an event, I feel lucky to have seen it, but at a loss to identify it as something earthly.  I am 62 years old, and have observed many different type planes, having been raised near Castle Air Force Base and near both commercial and military air bases.  I would love to learn if there has been any similar sightings!  This report is not a hoax.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Formation of colored lights hovering for 2 hours with swirling greenish orb lights/ FRESNO, CALIFORNIA;2014-10-25 23:00:00;2 hours;Formation of colored lights hovering for 2 hours with swirling greenish orb lights/ FRESNO, CALIFORNIA On 10/25/14 around 11:00 p.m. my daughter, husband and I saw pale green lights swirling in a circular fashion around in an elliptical circle.  No lights were emanating from the bottom as a spotlight would have.  We watched them and then went inside to get a jacket. When we came back out they were still then but stopped.  We then saw above us a Y shaped grouping of colored lights (red,greeen,pink,white fading in and out).It was very cloudy we would see this grouping of lights come in and out of the clouds as they moved motionless, hovering the lights stayed in formation.  We then saw at different times two triangular shaped formations with 3 lights. In the distance at one time we saw 3 lights in a straight line, which later disappeared.  As the clouds moved, we would see the Y shaped lights again and again.  They were hardly moving. Later in the distance the green swirling lights occurred again, first only one, then it seemed light 2 to 3 and they w! ere dancing in swirling formations.  There was a triangle of lights to the right of it.  As this triangle faded, so did the green swirling orb like lights disappear.  We watched this for 2 hours. We were in West Fresno the lights were to the Eastern portion of the sky.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
