Sphere/disc shaped object that appeared in the sky over fresno ca.;2001-06-04 04:00:00;2 hours;((NUFORC Note:  We believe that at least one of the two luminous objects described in this report may have been the planet Mars, which would be visible in the western, or southwestern, sky at this time of morning.  We will attempt to correspond with the witness in attempt to confirm this possibility.  PD)) Sphere/disc shaped object that appeared in the sky over fresno ca. Around 4:15 am pacific time I stepped outside my house to smoke a cigarette and noticed a bright light in the sky a considerable distance away. After examining the object for a few moments it hadn't changed position at all and made me start to wonder. Out of curiosity I went inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars to see what is was expecting to have just been over reacting. What I saw through the binoculars appeared to be some sort off-white/tan colored object that was sphereical/disc in shape. After studying it for a few minutes it seemed to rotate around on its horizontal axis exposing its full shape. It was a round object that appeared to be composed of an outer ring surrounding a central sphere/disc type object. Unfortunatly my binoculars wern't powerfull enough to make out the patterns on the central part of the object clearly, but there was obviously some sort of design/patterns in the central portion. It only alluminated that one color but had a orange light/orb that would come from it, move around a bit, then go back. After looking at this go on for approx 10 minutes I went inside and grabbed my digital camera and took pictures of it. Unfortunatly my camera doesnt have a zoom feature but the light/object is clearly seen in the pictures and if magnified the shape is noticable. After 30 minutes of observing this object to the west I noticed a second object to the south, orange in color and further away. It seemed to bare a resemblence in shape as the one to the west but I couldn't see it as well. I studied the object to the west from dark till sun rise (Approx 2 hours.) even after all the stars in the sky had gone the object was still very visable. Finally the sun came up in the west blinding any attept to continue looking at the object. In one of my photos the object isn't where it was and a second grey disc type object is in veiw, much closer. Although I never saw it while I was outside. After some research and photo enhancment it bares some resemblense to a water spot that the camera had poss! ibly con trasted out. I still dont 100% agree with this possibility due to the fact most of the water spots that become visable through enhancment are oval in shape and barely visable. This object is a perfect circle. I wasn't expecting to see what I did but now I'm changed from being open minded about ufo's to beleiving, as I've seen one with my own eye's. Either alien or military testing, whatever it was, was much more then anything I've even dreamed of.

Bright white sphere moving south over  Fresno;2007-07-25 22:00:00;5 min;Bright white sphere moving south over  Fresno Wednesday @ approximately 10:20pm, July 25,2007  I saw a bright light moving from north to south, flying at a slow speed, not to high and not too low, but a couple hundred feet in the air. I saw no outline of an airplane, it made no noise, and slowly traveled in the southernly direction towards LA.  I even used my binoculars and saw, no flashing lights, no color lights(red or green)but a white sphere. Not sure what it was but I know it couldn't have been a helicopter or airplane!  I live by an airport and see airplanes and jets take off daily.  This was no airplane! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Myself and three others viewed a blue orb like sphere stream across the sky.;2010-12-26 17:02:00;15 seconds;Myself and three others viewed a blue orb like sphere stream across the sky. UFO Sighting  	I believe at 5:02 PM Pacific Time Monday December 27, 2010 in Northeast Fresno, California three individuals and myself viewed what appeared to be an UFO.  I have no paranoia towards UFO or extraterrestrial life forms.  Although I believe their existence highly possible, I believe that this fact has no effect on what I saw.  All three individuals including myself acknowledged the scene that occurred.  All four of us pointed and followed the bright blue object that can only be described as an orb, as it streaked across the sky at a much lower altitude of any airplane.  The orb went south to northeast and was only visible for more than 15 seconds before it vanished very abruptly.  As I alerted the other individuals that it could be a possible UFO, they all dismissed the orb and didn’t mention it all day.  We viewed this in the northern sky in our car near the San Joaquin River.  The orb seemed to be above the water and going in the direction of the river to the north.  I believe I saw something that was not an airplane, and much faster than any remote light or flare. This is not a fake account.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Strange stationary red light  in the northwest sky in Fresno;2011-11-22 17:22:00;3-4 minutes;Strange stationary red light  in the northwest sky in Fresno I was driving west on Shaw Ave on observed a redish light in the northwest sky. It appeared to be stationary and was a constant light.  I drove a approximately one mile and turned off on a side street to stop and observe.  Within a few seconds after parking I observed the light move as if it were dropping, blink one or two times, vanish and then two bright much smaller white lights flashed in a line.  After this there was nothing in that area of the sky;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Object being chased by 2 fighter jets;2012-06-26 23:30:00;20 seconds;June 26, 2012 – 23:30 pm (approx. time) Weather: Clear sky, no clouds, half moon to east (Not visible to me) Sky view (degrees) est: 120 – north/south, 90 – east/west Fresno, CA (Northeast)   Object being chased by 2 fighter jets  At approximately 11:30 pm on June 28, 2012, I let my dogs out to do their nightly business.  As usual, I went out with them to look at the stars.  I was just getting ready to go back inside when I heard a louder than usual jet engine.  I looked up to see two military fighters flying in a north to south direction at a high rate of speed.  They appeared to be at about 10 to 12 thousand feet (estimated).  I am not sure how fast they were going. Certainly not above mach I, but close, maybe.  They were in a slight climb as they passed almost directly overhead.  All of their navigational lights and strobes were on.  Just in front of the fighters (approximately one quarter of a mile), I saw a single, pale, greenish/white, spherical light that was about the size of a ballpoint pen tip.  It was pulling away, slightly, from the jets.  A few seconds later, the object executed a slight climbing right turn to the southwest, and accelerated, increasing the distance from the fighters as they turned to follow it. At that point, the object disappeared (winked out).  The jets continued to the southwest until I could no longer see them.  The whole sighting lasted no more than twenty seconds from the time I first saw the jets until the object winked out.  It is unusual to see any aircraft flying north to south at the altitude I observed, because of the proximity to Fresno Air Terminal, and the traffic patterns.  Though, at 11:30 pm, there is almost no air traffic at all.  Also, the Air National Guard is based at FAT, and they tend to keep noise levels at a minimum over the city.  I am a retired Information Technology Analyst, and a private pilot, and have lived in Fresno, CA for more than sixty years.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Slow moving pillar of orbs floating horizontally and passed by 4 people.;2013-09-08 01:30:00;5 minutes;Slow moving pillar of orbs floating horizontally and passed by 4 people. Saturday night 4 of us were hanging out on our roof in the downtown area.  my friend spotted something in the sky and pointed it out.  It looked like a pillar of luminescent smoke from a distance.  As it got closer and I could see it better it looked almost like a chain of 4-6 plastic bags with a candle inside.  (Our brains were trying to comprehend what we were seeing more than remembering exactly what it looked like.  Unfortunately no one thought to grab a camera until it had gotten too far away)  It moved slowly and horizontally and we could actually see energy lines that it was riding on.  They stayed in line but would bobble back and forth sometimes.  The edges and body of the orb seemed to be made out of plasma or something and I observed a soft yellow glow while others saw more red.  It passed within about 20 feet of us just a dozen feet above the roof.  Since then I've talked to 2 friends who also saw this from the tower district.  My research has led me to believe they were inter-dimensional balls of plasma which had leaked through from another dimension and fully materialized in our own.  Many of us are into meditation and healing, this thing left us with a very wonderful feeling and has changed all of our lives for the better.  Another friend was also below us in her room playing bass, we wonder if that had something to do with it.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Husband and I saw up to 8 spherical orange-ish high floating/flying objects go over our house at 6:30 PM (darkened sky).;2014-02-21 18:30:00;10 minutes;Husband and I saw up to 8 spherical orange-ish high floating/flying objects go over our house at 6:30 PM (darkened sky). My husband had just gotten home from work and came into the house to call me outside.  He wanted me to see something in the sky that he'd noticed as he pulled into our driveway.  He said he'd seen multiple objects moving across the night sky they appeared to be coming from the northwest.   By the time I got outside, I saw just three or four passing overhead.  They gave off a dim orange glow, and looked like they might be hot air balloons.  They appeared to float, but moved fairly quickly, eventually disappearing as if extinguished.   They definitely did not look or move like airplanes or other identifiable types of aircraft.   We both felt we had seen something strange and inexplicable.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Whooshing sphere with red lights and a white search light at the bottom.;2018-12-15 23:00:00;~3 minutes;Whooshing Sphere with red lights and a white search light at the bottom. I was in bed about to fall asleep when I heard a whooshing sound, I jumped from bed moved the blinds in the window aside and saw a somewhat clear sphere that had red lights at the bottom.  The sphere was zipping around really fast back and forth like it was looking for something then it stopped at my window as it knew I was looking at it, a bright white light like a spot light that was inside at the bottom of the sphere spun around and shone in my eye.  It felt like the light only shone in my left eye which felt uncomfortable by the brightnest of the light, and evey time I think about it I feel the uncomfort in my left eye.  I immediately closed my eyes, yelled and fell to the floor I peeped threw the blinds and saw that the object was gone.  I remember it made a humming sound the whooshing sound came from it zipping back and forth as in a hurry.  I wish I could have got a picture or video of it because no one believe me do to prior encounters.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
