3 strange lights, hovering, flipping, and spinning like a top very close to the I5freeway.;2007-06-22 02:00:00;approx 3 minutes;3 strange lights, hovering, flipping, and spinning like a top very close to the I5freeway. My boyfriend and I were driving home to San Bernardino from Ashland, OR when he woke me up to look at something. He woke me up and pointed out these two lights that were flashing in the sky. To him, he thought it was a plane that was flying so low it was going to crash. We watched these lights for a minute, and a third one lit up and the thing flipped over, and was doing all these crazy flips. Then, it flew over the freeway towards I5North and it went into this field and looked like it had landed, but you could still see the lights. Suddenly they came back up, hovering, and started spinning like a top. It flipped over and came back over the freeway to I5South, and by this time it was behind us. My boyfriend told me to get his digital video camera out, and as I was looking for it, the thing turned on it's side and flared up its lights and looked as if it was coming after his car. I decided to forget about the camera and just told him to drive.  I'm not saying anything about aliens or other life forms - there could have been a very logical explanation for what we saw....but as of right now, I don't know what that is. So I can only define it as an unidentified flying object,which is exactly what it was.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
