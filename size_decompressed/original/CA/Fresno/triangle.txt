I am a police officer in Fresno, Cal.  I was on top of a 10 story building taking a report when I looked up to see our police chopper fly by.   When I started to look down at my report, I noticed what appeared to be a trangle flying object.  It was about 10,000 feet up and about 2-3 miles away.  It was dusk and I could seen orange/red color lights flicker, not flash, on each of the trangle tips.  There appeared to be some sort of orange light or glow in the cender of the bottom.  I could not see the top.   I could not see the color of the object. It appeared to move very slow, slower then a normal plane.  Then, all of a sudden, the object increased its speed almost instantly, shot straight up and out of sight in about 1-2 seconds.   I also had seen something like this several years ago in the same city, but was too busy to worry about it then.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

This is what happens that night it was my brother 13 the birthday.  So he invited couple of his friends over and cousin's. and he wanted to camp out in the backyard for his birthday so we set up couple tents..and crashed outâ€¦  I was in a tent with my cousin.  the tent had a sky view window so you had the view to look into the stars..  so that night it was partly cloudy and.  I rember  waking up in the middle of the night looking thru the sky view window and I saw a triangle shape object hovering right above us  Turing in circle motions with different color lights on the outside of object.  Blue green white lights..  something I never ever seen before...it was just hovering in and out of the clouds..my cousin was laying next to me as I woke him up to look at this strange object it was gone..like it knew I was watching ever since that day I've been a believer...;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

A machine with amazing lights that can swoop to ground level and go dangerously fast.;2002-07-03 22:45:00;50 minutes;A machine with amazing lights that can swoop to ground level and go dangerously fast. they looked like three separate sets of car headlights racing on ground level, then they shot up at a 90 degree angle in an instant(about 30 feet off the ground), and formed a triangle, then shot back down instantly and took off, then did it again in a matter of a second or two. It was almost like it saw me the first time, took off, and then didd a double take. I could not believe how close these things were to the car. I then told the other two passengers in the front seat to look at what I saw. It sat in the same position shining it's three bright lights every 20-30 seconds from the moment I told the passengers until about 20-25 minutes later when the view of it was lost due to our elevation dropping on the freeway. We were on the I-5 freeway heading north, and everything I saw was on the East side of the freeway. I first saw it right where the I-5 and the 269 meet. Then, about 30-40 minutes later, we saw a similar light in the sky about 20 miles ahead and four miles east. Only, this light was shining two vertical lights whereas the other was shining three in triangular form. This thing would dive down(eg. Superman the ride at six flags) at unbelievable speed to ground level and zip all the way across the horizon within a matter of seconds and then go back up and stop on a dime in mid-air and do it's light thing again. It did this over and over again for about 20-25 minutes until we hit the 152 and went into th hills and lost sight of it. What we saw looked very dangerous and all three of us can't believe it didn't crash. If a human being was inside this thing then he/she deserves a medal for risking their lives. I'm a 25 yr. old male. The other two witnesses were a 29 yr. old male, and a 23 yr. old female.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Totally silent craft bearing three, bright, white lights observed crossing I-5 near Fresno CA on 05-19-03 at 00:10.;2003-05-19 00:10:00;3 - 5 min.;Totally silent craft bearing three, bright, white lights observed crossing I-5 near Fresno CA on 05-19-03 at 00:10. At approximately 00:10 on 05-19-03 soon after passing a Frenso, CA turnoff about 60 min. north of Harris Ranch our SUV (98 Explorer) was headed south on I-5 when the driver noticed some bright, white lights up and to our right.  He wondered if there was a highway above us, because the lights seemed to be heading south parallel to I-5.  Suddenly the lights turned and zoomed down toward the freeway rapidly.  He guessed it covered 2 miles in about 10-15 seconds.  At this point the craft slowed down, and he alerted mo of its presence.  We both thought it was a very low-flying, large airplane, and we watched as it crossed the freeway in front of us.  It was so low, we were barely looking up.  The craft turned left and headed north above the ground next to the north-bound side of I-5.  It appeared to be trying to land, when suddendly this large craft (about 40-60 feet across) banked sharply, about 45 degrees.  We were amazed that a craft that big, flying so low and so slow could have turned that sharply successfully.  It seemed that there was no way without stalling.  As it banked, the three bright, white lights seemed equidistant apart, one in the center and one on each end.  The craft was TOTALLY silent.  It crossed I-5 in front of us again, this time it was heading west and was only about 100 feet in front of us, and about 40 feet off the ground.  It was so low we hoped it wouldn't hit us.  We thought it might crash in the field to our right, but it descended and decelerated, no noise, no noticeable dust.  It seemed it would land safely as it almost skimmed the ground.  At this time, we were looking out the side windows, to our right, down and slightly back.  The craft seemed lower than our SUV. It seemed the bottom was flat, because the lights were skimming the ground.  The only lights we saw, were shining forward on the craft.  However, from this oblique view, they seemed to be positioned at a slightly obtuse angle (approximately 150 degrees).  It was very dark and neither of us saw any shape to the craft, except for the position of the lights.  All three lights seemed to be in the horizontal plane, as it skimmed the ground, at about 15 to 20 mph, almost touching it for about 150 ft.  Then just as I thought it was about to land, it suddenly tilted up and disappeared.  Soon after this the driver saw the three bright, white lights, in the rear-view mirror.  I turned and watched out the back window as it made several more passes across I-5.  The driver caught glimpses of these passes in the rear-view mirror.  Eventually we lost sight of it as we drove out of range.  At this point we noticed the car clock light was flashing -- nothing else.  It continued to flash for a few more minutes.  The time kept changing correctly as it blinked.  Then it returned to normal without being reset.  We never heard any noise or saw any shape except for the lights.  There were three other sleeping passengers, who never awakened during the incident.  There were also other cars on both sides of the freeway during this sighting.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Sighting of flying triangle with lights in weaving motion like a sting ray about 150-200 ft. off the ground;2005-06-26 03:30:00;5 minutes;Sighting of flying triangle with lights in weaving motion like a sting ray about 150-200 ft. off the ground During the morning of June 26,2005, on a drive up north from Los Angeles, CA, I was travelin on Highway 5 or the 101 through the rural areas of California.  When I was approaching Fresno, CA I noticed an object with about 6 light about 200 feet up in the air.  The object was moving vigorously in a wave like manner.  The object was hovered over farm crops.  I instantly noticed how peculiar the object was as I moved closer.  I drove side by side with the flying object for about 15-30 seconds and observed it moving in the motion of a sting ray.  The object was very large and had bright white and blue lights on it.  As I traveled north I noticed it did the same, but weaved backwards and proceeded forward.  I continued to watch the object through my rearview mirror and I noticed that it was moving as if it were sowing something.  I immediately thought of crop circles.  The object was making a wave-like motion and traveling back and forth, it was a huge dark triangle with lights on it and not too far off the ground but high enough to be flying (like I said about 150-200 ft).  Being approximately 50 ft away from the object I could not hear the object making any noise, such as aircrafts do.  But it was moving at about 20-25 miles per hour.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

red glowing lights form triangle;2009-01-23 22:35:00;3 minutes;red glowing lights form triangle I work Security at night, and I was just leaving some ones house that was a loud party call. My partner called me, he is about a mile away locking up a pool and dock area, he tells me to look up in the sky, I  do, and there is a big triangle,( the point is at the rear, ) with red glowing lights at each point. Now when I say lights, I don't mean like car or plane or copter lights. They looked like a glow from a fire or if a trash can was turned upside down and a huge road flare was put inside of it. I didn't see anything else to describe, no hull, nothing else. It was very cloudy that night due to an earlier rain, the clouds were low, and it moved right in them. It also moved very slow.  As it moved further away from me, the back      light trailed back and the front left light trailed to the left. And that is the last I seen of it. It was also big, hard to tell exactly, best guess, about 60 to 75 feet. It was some what close, about 100 to 150 yards in front of me, and about 3 light poles up, I am not great at guessing feet when it comes to altitude. There was no sound that I could hear. Juan, my partner said he seen some of the hull, and saw the lights crossing. I will try to get him to fill a report out.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Strange lights/UFO's over Fresno,Ca near the airport.;2011-07-05 00:38:00;20 minutes;Strange lights/UFO's over Fresno,Ca near the airport. On July 5th, 2011, at 12.:38 am my son and I were in our backyard talking. we live about 4 miles from the Fresno airport and were watching airplanes and police helicopters in the shy that night.  People have been lighting off illegal firworks and we were watching the show.   As we were looking up, I saw a large triangle craft moving slowly to the south-west towords the airport.  I was standing facing the same direction, when my son spoted another set of lights that looked like bright orbs.  There was 3 of them and moving south-east of our home.   The large triangeled changed colors form white to red to blue then back to white, then started to fly way faster than anything else that was in the shy that night and was out of sight in about 4 seconds.  The orbs also changed color.  Red,white and then back to red.  We could see other airplanes flying into the Fresno airport and taking off, but nothing could fly without making a sound.   We waited to see if the Air National Guard would send jets to the area of these objects, but nothing. We have seen other unexplained lights over the greater Fresno/Clovis area for the last couple of months, but nothing like this.  The orbs stayed on the same course, but came together as one light and disapeared straight up.   There were at least 3 helicopters and multiple airplanes that night, but nothing moved or looked like those lights we saw that night.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

But the strange thing about it they were all moving at the same time and pace.  It was clear that it wasn't a plane because it looked so close like as if a house near by had a very large antenna on the top of the roof.   But as we got closer we realized it was above us!!  It was above the intersection of all the traffic!!   Traffic had pulled over and started taking pictures of the sighting with their cellphones.  And then it just vanished. It was pretty cool!!

At about 10pm, my friend and I were on the way to my house and I noticed three bright lights in the sky making the shape of a triangle.  At first I thought it was lights for a tower like the ones you would see at a airport, but since I drive down that particular road at least 10-20 times a week it was not usually there and it was too far away from the town airport to be a tower for it.  As we drove south more, I noticed that it seemed we were getting closer to it so it was staying still and I also noticed that I couldn't see any metal connecting below it so it had to be floating/flying in the sky.  It was kind of low like when a airplane is going to land, but it stood still in the same spot not moving side to side or up and down.   After looking at it for a couple minutes my friend driving finally saw it and asked what it was, he was intrigued and pulled over so we could get a better look, by the time he pulled over and turned to look it was quickly fading away and! then was gone.
