Bright craft observed by two teenagers in fresno ca 1989;1989-07-15 21:00:00;1-2 min;Bright craft observed by two teenagers in fresno ca 1989 Around the summer of 1989, a friend and I both about 13 years of age were on the roof of my moms’ house pretending to be ninjas and sword fighting.  It was about 9pm. We noticed a light in the sky. It was a very clear calm night it looked like a ball of fire like a hot coal. The closer it got to us it looked more like a football or possibly saucer shaped thing, which was hot white/yellow in the center and got orangish gold toward the outside. This thing flew from a distance away toward us and above and beyond us across the sky. Approximately 500ft up?  It was totally silent. The size to our vision would be similar to if you held a children’s “nerf” football out at arms length. Being at the height that I assume it was, it was very big. Bigger than my moms house easily. I have seen the EXACT SAME style craft on a ufo show. the one where craft hits the desert then bounces back up then hits again and explodes into a million firey lights, its pretty popular i think. Here is the weird part, we had my moms camera up there to use like a scope (kids ya know) it was an old 80’s rectangular style one. Anyway with camera in hand I saw all this. Never once thought to take a picture at all. It was too strange for me to do anything but stare at this thing. It didn’t move super fast either. 100mph? Now that im almost 33 im a better judge of visual speed applied to something at a distance and 100mph for an air craft isn’t that much I think. We had our parents look through the news papers to see if a meteor had hit or other people reported seeing it. it was really big. There was nothing. Ok, years later, when I spoke to my friend about this again, he said something I didn’t remember and still barely remember. Within 5 min of the sighting, he said 3-5 military style helicopters flew across in the same direction. This could have been at the point that I jumped off the roof and frantically tried to explain to my mom what had just happened. Since those days, I have become a huge ufo enthusiast as well as other unexplained things. All stemming from personal experiences like this one.  I will post more sightings I have had over the years right after this one too because the form wouldn’t let me use “various” under times and dates. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

Adult male reports witnessing a fast-moving, orange-colored fireball streak overhead.;2004-04-25 22:35:00;15-20 sec.;Adult male reports witnessing a fast-moving, orange-colored fireball streak overhead. Telephoned Report:   An adult male telephoned from Fresno, CA, to report having witnessed a peculiar, orange fireball streak across the nighttime sky above Fresno, CA.  He reported that the object moved generally from the northwest sky, as viewed from his vantage point on the ground, to the southeast sky, covering an estimated 140 degrees of arc, in approximately 15-20 seconds.  The sighting occurred at between 2230-2240 hrs. (PDT) on Sunday night, April 25, 2004.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Orange fireball moved across sky, hovered over my house, went high into the sky, then light disappeared as it went to a larger craft.;2014-03-16 02:20:00;<4 minutes;Orange fireball moved across sky, hovered over my house, went high into the sky, then light disappeared as it went to a larger craft I was outside and looked up and a burning light that looked like a large orange fireball was glowing (not blinking, and it appeared to be only one light).   At first, I thought maybe it was a plane but as it moved closer, I thought it might be some sort of meteor.  As it came closer I realized it wasn't anything that I've ever seen before.  It moved laterally through the sky at a fast pace at about a helicopter's height in the sky and then it hovered over my house, stopped, went back a bit, went forward a bit, then went up higher and higher and got darker and darker.  Then the light went out but I could still see something there, way up in the sky.   The larger darker object stayed stagnant for about 20 seconds, moved forward slowly at first and then it went toward the northwest at a much faster pace than before and traveled across the sky till I couldn't see it anymore because of the distance.   This thing was pretty huge for me to see it clearly fly across the sky with no illumination.  To me it looked black and long, maybe cylinder or rectangle-shaped but hard to tell since it was so dark in the sky.   My stupid phone is so cheap I couldn't get any good shots of it.  I have two pictures but they are very small and I need a usb cord to retrieve them.   I realized later that the fireball was flying in virtually the same path the military jets take when they fly over our house.  I'm in NW Fresno, CA, and they usually come from the east and fly northwest.   The sky was nice and bright and clear with an almost full moon.  It was really big, whatever it was.  It had no trail, it was silent, and appeared to be lower than an airplane until it stopped and went higher.  It definitely wasn't any kind of weather balloon or anything I've ever seen before.   The sky was clear with an almost full moon.  There appeared to be no other air traffic until a few minutes after it went away.   The entire sighting lasted about 4 minutes or less.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
9-14 Scattered Orange Glowing Lights Hovering Across Fresno.;2014-04-05 21:45:00;4-5 minutes;9-14 Scattered Orange Glowing Lights Hovering Across Fresno. I observed 9-14 orange-ish glowing objects hovering slowly in the sky around 9:40pm.  They appeared to be heading from West to North towards my direction at first, but then the objects started moving southward.   The glowing objects were scattered from each other, but they were all moving in the same direction in a synchronized motion.  I would guess the approximate altitude of the objects ranged from 3000 to 5000 feet in elevation.   The glowing objects started to disappear from the sky one after another even though they were at a distance that should’ve been observable if it were a plane.   I got out of my vehicle to try and record them, but my phone camera couldn’t really capture the glowing objects due to the poor lighting conditions outside.   There were no blinking signals (such as those seen on aircrafts), and I didn’t hear any type of aircraft sound.  The objects were dead silent, and hovering and a constant speed which seemed to be moving much slower than typical airplanes.  I pulled up to some police officers at a stop-light 10-15 minutes after the event, asked them if anyone had called in about “weird lights in the sky” and they said no.   Approximate duration of sighting was 4-5 minutes.   This is the first time I have ever witnessed anything like this.   A little background about me:  I’m a U.S. Navy veteran who has seen almost every type of aircraft there is to see during my time out at sea.  I’m 29 y/o male, and I’m a Healthcare Administration major at California State University, Fresno.   Just letting everyone know that I’m not a whacko.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
I saw three orange redish glowing globes in the sky!;2014-12-22 21:45:00;4-5 minutes;I saw three orange redish glowing globes in the sky! Yes I'm 46 yrs. old, my brother is 52, and my mother is 71.  We live in the same house.  This past Monday night.  I stepped out of the house to smoke a cigarette.  I noticed some plane or something with a bright orange light slowly coming towards us and steady climbing.  Then I realized that this didn't look or act like a plane.  In awe of this glowing orange globe it seemed to start climbing a little more rapidly.  Then I saw a second, then third one all following the first one it seemed  and at a substantial equal distances and in a perfect straight line.  I ran to get my brother and told him to hurry and come look at this and with the tone of my voice he turned and ran for the door to follow me.  I ran to the backyard which is the south side of the house and they were still in sight approximately 4-5 miles to the south.  All of a sudden the lead one who was climbing in altitude almost strait up but at a slight angle seemed to level out turning in a southerly directi! on then just vanished.  The second two were on the same path behind the lead one and 20-30 seconds later they also disappeared.  My mom ran and looked through the back window when she heard the commotion.  They made me not be a skeptic anymore.  You know I've always wished that I could see a UFO just once.  And now that I've seen one, I'm not so sure now.  It's kinda cool but also really scary!!!;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
