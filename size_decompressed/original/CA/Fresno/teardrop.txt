Mass sighting of 30-40 black objects over Fresno, CA.;2015-10-08 10:05:00;20 seconds;Mass sighting of 30 to 40 black objects over Fresno, CA. Thursday October 8, 2015.  At 10:05 am, my wife and I were traveling on Freeway 180, between Fowler and Clovis Avenues, about a mile south of Fresno-Yosemite airport in rural Fresno, CA.   In the clear sky about what we thought to be  a mile or two west of the airport, out of our front window we saw about thirty to forty black objects maybe more stretching across the sky. We viewed them for about ten seconds until our line of sight was blocked by huge winery tanks off the freeway.  As an estimate this fragmented formation could have been up to a mile in length moving across the sky in a slow hovering motion.  The largest body of the grouping was closest to us and narrowing down in size as it distanced away.   My first impression was a mass parachute dropping near the airport?  A few seconds later driving past the tanks the sky opened,  and again we saw them but now they were clumped together in a tighter formation.   After again losing sight as the freeway dropped behind the trees I rushed ahead for about a minute, to where the freeway was above the trees giving us a full view of the north west  sky.  To our amazement there was nothing, only helicopter circling above and a black SUV off the freeway with the two occupants looking up with one pointing to the western sky.  I assure you these were no parachutes or birds, but something I have never witnessed before.   If my judgment of distance was correct they had to be at least the size of a small airplane.  If they were actually farther away they were then much larger.  This formation was not like one you would normally see displayed by an air force flight but that of a semi-scattered group in closer proximity to each other but yet looking fragmented and not necessarily pointed in exactly the same direction.   Trying to determine their shape and size was a bit confusing as they first appeared to be more square on the left end and sloping down on the right.  Like a fat eyebrow to even perhaps a delta look, but their shapes, though seeming somewhat uniform, were not.  Trying to get my mind to focus on them was strange to say the least, as if they were trying to change bits of their shapes as I watched.   I called the airport tower spokesman asking if they had seen anything as such and he said he wasn’t on duty this morning and there was no report.  The Tower spokesman then gave me the number to the UFO center and encouraged me to call.   I am a 1967-69 Army veteran and retired fire captain and have never before witnessed such a sight.   Incredible …;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
20 to 30 black objects hovering in sky.;2015-10-08 10:05:00;20 seconds;20 to 30 black objects hoering in sky October 8, 2015, At approximately 10:05 AM my husband and myself were driving west on Hwy 180 and between Fowler Ave and Clovis Ave I noticed, I thought a flock of birds in the right hand sky above the tree line.  I said look at that flock of birds or maybe it's ducks.   My husband responded that can't be birds, they're too big for birds.  The formation was kind of round to the left and gradually & sparsely dwindling to the right, kind of like the tail.  The formation was made up of black shapes, some large, some larger and some smaller.  Their shapes were bigger on one rounded end than the other rounded end and the sides were straight lines.  Some of these shapes were moving and the smaller ones in the tail section were fading. So, right before Clovis Ave, the winery storage tanks cut off their view until you're almost under the overpass.  At that point the sky opened up again and the shapes converged into a larger mass (left) that still had the shapes, but they now were much darker and they were NOT moving, but kind of hovering in the air (the tail, for lack of a better word, had disappeared).  It is hard to describe in words, but easier to describe verbally.  I think it was kind of hard to look at, meaning hard to describe something that made no sense!   They disappeared again because of the freeway embankment, but my husband said we'll catch them at Hwy 41 where the road climbs and the embankment disappears.  Well, needless to say, the mysterious thing in the sky had disappeared!;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
7 fireballs seen coming our way, Came over our heads, we could see bottom of crafts. No sound;2020-07-04 22:45:00;8 minutes;7 fireballs seen coming our way, Came over our heads, we could see bottom of crafts. No sound This event happened on the 4th of July 2020. In Fresno, California.  My Daughter and I were sitting outside in our lounge chairs by the pool, after everybody else in our family had gone to bed.  We were facing North . I am 58 and my daughter is 35 years old. At about 10:45pm my daughter said, mom what is that?  I looked up and through some trees I could see what looked like a ball of fire.  Maybe a couple of city blocks away.  With some fireworks still going off, my first thought was it had to be related.  But within seconds I could tell it was coming straight towards us, moving South.  When another fire ball came up behind it, and then another, with a total of 7 round fire lights.  Orange, reddish in color. Coming straight at us. The first one is right over our heads now we are looking straight up.  The fire ball light was gone. We could only see the bottom of a vehicle it was in a tear drop shape . NO lights and NO sound . It was a full moon that night so we could see the bottom of this flying thing.  I would say it was traveling about the height of a helicopter flying in a city maybe 200 or 300 yards up.  It was moving at about 20 miles per hour.  A total of 5 vehicles past over us.  The last 2 turned to the East before they reach us. When we looked to the south after passing us, they disappeared quickly.  No lights on the back. So, we could not see them for very long as they moved into the moon light. My daughter and I are both hoping someone can provide an earthly explanation for what we seen that night.  I think about this event daily, having trouble sleeping and concentrating on daily task.  I have told some family and the first thing they say is did you take pictures.  No pictures, I think I was afraid to run and grab my phone, because I thought I would miss it.  But truly, it never even came to thought.  I did draw it out on paper.  I feel like I am waiting for their return, always looking up or out in the night sky.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
