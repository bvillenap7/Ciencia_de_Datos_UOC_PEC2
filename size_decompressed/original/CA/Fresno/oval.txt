BIG NOISELESS CRAFT AT SPEEDS FASTER THAN ANY THING EVER HEARD OF.;1992-06-20 02:00:00;2 minutes;BIG NOISELESS CRAFT AT SPEEDS FASTER THAN ANY THING EVER HEARD OF. Arround 2oo a m, my cousin was driving, when, all of a sudden, a light came down very fast, and settled about 1/2 mile ahead of us,probably 150 feet above the ground. We had to pass right under this craft, which wasn't a helicopter, or an airplane. There was a dim light hovering arround this oval shaped object, but we could not tell where the light was coming from it was just there. Right before we got close to it, it moved to the side of I-5, briefly touched down, didnt make a sound, or lift a single particle of loose sand. About 2 seconds later, it took off, moved back  to it's original possition, by now above us.It was as big as a football field, and didn't make a single sound. Then it took off, and it was amazing how such a big aircraft moved so fast without making the slightest sound. It was so fast, that it dissapeared in the sky in less than a full second. We looked at each other, described what we had just seen, and promised not to sayanything to anybody, fearing they would say we were crazy. We have talked about it 2 or 3 times since then I have told my immediate fammily, and they don't seem to believe. Both me and my cousyn were 30 years old at the time.

A large Oval glowing white light Hovering over Grapevines in Fowler,Ca.;2013-10-03 19:00:00;15 minutes;A large Oval glowing white light Hovering over Grapevines in Fowler,Ca. Back when I lived in Fowler, Ca in the country surrounded by grapevines I was out front after sunset when I turned around I saw this bright oval / egg shape all white object just hovering high out in the distance looking North.  It just hovered with no sound.  It was not blinking just looked bright. Guessing about 40 degree high.  This was after sunset during blue hour 1900 hours or so on Oct 3, 2013. I was alone no other witness and no planes around. After some I past I would say around 15 minutes, I saw it move slowly to it's left my right a few yards then it disappeared. It looked like it had it's own light from within. A glow. That was it. I was very surprised what I saw. I used my Nikon D50 at the time. I was learning how to use that camera. I had no idea I would capture something like this. MUFON Case #  90915 Thank you.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Bright orange oval over Fresno, CA;2014-03-28 22:00:00;~15 minutes;Bright orange oval over Fresno, CA My fiance and I just got back from the store, and as we were walking up to our apartment, I noticed I very bright orange light in the sky.  I was watching it for a few minutes as it was slowly moving southwest.  We decided to head to our back patio to continue watching this bizarre, oval light. About 2 minutes after we first noticed it, it suddenly discharged a smaller orange light which quickly faded off into the distance. At this point, the large bright light was just hovering, not moving anywhere!   Another 2 minutes passed of this bright orange light hovering, somewhat fading, when it suddenly got brighter again and shot off yet another smaller orange light off into the distance!   Immediately after the second small orange light was discharged, the large orange light started to fade until it disappeared.  It was fading up into space.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
