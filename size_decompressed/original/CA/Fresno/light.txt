Two white lights beneath clouds-one fell at a 90 degree angle straight down, blinking continouslyand then stopped over the San Joaquin ;1998-11-10 18:48:00;15-20 sec.;Two white lights beneath clouds-one fell at a 90 degree angle straight down, blinking continouslyand then stopped over the San Joaquin River. Lost sight of objects as I was driving. I was driving north of Fresno on Friant Rd., heading for my home in Auberry, when I noticed two white lights that I took to be aircraft landing lights. Suddenly, one object fell at a 90 degree angle straight down, blinking continously. The other object remained hovering as the second fell. The falling object then came to a stop over the San Joaquin River(Fresno-Madera County Line) and kept blinking. Objects were lost to sight as I was driving. Weather-Cloudy and light-moderate rain. Visibility good given the circumstances.Time was 18:48 PST. Other witnesses-unknown, but there were several cars behind me, so I assume that those people in the cars saw the same objects. Interference on car: none. Interference on car radio: none.Total time of observation: 15-20 seconds. Background of observer: Grad Student at Cal State Univ Fresno-Master's Candidate in History and USMC Officer Candidate. Will be attending USMC Officer Candidate School Feb-Mar 99 as aviation officer-prospective Naval Flight Officer(Navigator). Am familiar with aircraft lights-CSUF is in the traffic pattern for Fresno-Yosemite IAP, as is my hometown of Auberry-also, given my career choice-I had better be familiar with aircraft,helicopters, etc.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Two nights in a row. We were not scared, even though we knew they could not possibly be  planes.;2000-08-06 21:30:00;10min.;Two nights in a row. We were not scared, even though we knew they could not possibly be  planes. I went outside during a commercial on TV and looked up into the sky facing North. The sky was clear and the stars were easy to see. I saw an extremly bright red light comming from the North heading South very high in the sky.  It was quite large and moving not like a plane but sort of sideways kind of like a Z but still in the same direction. It had a red light and a green light but no light in the front like a plane.  I called for my husband to hurry because it was moving kind of fast. My husband and children came out also.  It passed almost directly over us and had very bright light on the bottom but made no sound. I don't know if we heard nothing because it made no sound or because it was so high up, but the white lights on the bottom were very bright. We had to walk to the street to continue to see it because of the roof top and because of the brightness we were able to watch it for about 10 minutes, until we lost it.  I wanted to tell people at work the next day but didn't want people to think I was strange.  Then tonight 8/7/00 when my husband went outside around 9:45pm I followed him we saw 2 objects comming from the north east heading in a straight line south east, like the night before just as high in the sky but moving fast.  There were two airplanes with one of the objects in back and it moved so fast it passed the airplane like it was standing still.  The objects lights have a different look than a plane.  We watched them and the planes until the tree got in the way.  Then about 5 min later there were 3 more comming from the same direction moving very fast faster than a jet and flashing only red lights.  At one point one disappeared (no lights) then they all disappeared (lights gone) then reappeared (lights on all at the same time).  They were in an -l pattern (like a backwards L). It took only a few min maybe 1-3 to pass from the north to the south then out of sight because of the tree.  I saw no white lights tonight. We have a reserve base in Fresno and we see alot of jets fly. We also ha! ve an ai rport and can see the planes take off.  These objects including the planes did not take off from Fresno due to the high altitude they were flying and the proximiaty of the airport to my home. The objects were flying faster than any jet I have seen take off from Fresno. We do not live in the airports flight path, planes don't usually fly over our house. The objects tonight were in the same flight path as we see the big jets fly. Tomorrow night I plan on looking for them between 9-10pm hopefully the sky will be clear again. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness is describing, but she states that the object had a red light and a green light on it.  These colors are suggestive to us  of an aircraft.  Any vessel, either a ship or an aircraft, must have a red light on its left side, and a green light on its right side, in order to facilitate avoidance during navigation at night.

Bright rapidly moving blue white light;2001-11-25 20:40:00;10 seconds;Bright rapidly moving blue white light At 20:40 My wifeand I saw a bright blue- white light which moved rapidly decending across the sky from south to north, I am a 62 year old professional television broadcaster.  What my wife and I observed tonight was the brightest light in the sky in a fast decending arc that we have ever seen in our collective lives.  We were driving westbound and both saw the light  at exactly the same time.  I commented to her Look at that at about the same time she said I see it.  We both remarked that it appeared to be a Meteor , but as it crossed in front of us in a decending arc, it didn't flame out as one might expect, but continued to be very bright until it disappeared below the horizon. It was a very bright circular light, moving very rapidly from south to north as we were traveling west bound in our vehicle.  It moved from about 230 degrees to approximately 290 degress when it disappeared.  We viewed it for approximately 10 seconds.  When it disappeared from our sight, we both remarked that we were waiting for a loud explosion or bright light in the sky, as if it might have crashed to earth.  But, nothing was seen or heard after we lost sight of the object.  The object was approximately 10% of the size of a full moon. I immediately called the local police department from my cellular telephone to report the sighting, and to ask if any other calls had been reported. At the time of my call, the local authorities had not received any other calls. ((NUFORC Note:  We were directed to this witness by the Fresno Police Department, for whose assistance we are grateful.  We spoke with the witness, and found him to be an exceptionally good witness.  Object may have been a meteor, but we are uncertain, given the other reports we received from other parts of the U. S., Canada, and Brazil for this date.  PD));36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

The night was perfect clear, and i saw this bright RED looking star up in the western sky!  at first i thought it could be mars, however i remembered that it couldn't be seen at that time, so i watched...it slowly started to move southward.  I noticed that the red light started to dim a little bit, and then get bright agian.  this light was brighter than anything else in the sky! i knew it wasn't a plane because there were no blinking blue lights.  then it moved up slightly and a little piece of it seemed to break off and fall down and then faded away...soon after the light too faded away...this is by far the most bizzare thing i've ever seen in the sky.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

The object was a solid white light and moved about as fast as a fast jet would go when in high altitude or as fast as a small plane would at about 1000 feet up.  This object did not appear to very high in altitude it appeared to be at the altitude that a small plane would be at to travel across the valley (3,000 to 5,000 ft.).  There were no other lights on it and did not have any blinking lights or colored lights.  The same brightness was observed when due south and when moving into the east.  I looked at it through my binoculars 10X50 and only a bright light could be seen.  I have look at Mars (or is it Venus) with the same binoculars and see the changing colors, I did not see any change in color while viewing this object.  It just went over the horizon (behind the next house).;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

This also alarmed me because it did not turn like any plane or animal could. It then made a 45 degree cut back to the north and then cut one last time back to the north and seemed to rise out of sight. I was stuned and happy to see such a thing.

There is a tree in the neighbors yard that I can see from my backyard. I suddenly saw a glowing light come from behind the tree (no bigger than the north star) in a straight line heading west and then it stopped gave two flashes of light simultaneously and all of a sudden shot straight in the air at such a speed it was unbelieveable and as it went higher it gave one last flash and completely went black. The whole experience lasted 4 seconds. No longer. I know what I saw was real it was so silent and so fast there is no way it was anything human.

Light travelling toward the north-north east steadily. Not fading as is typical with satellites. No deviation from straight line. Altitude unknown. No sound. High enough to disappear over the Sierra Nevada mountains to the east of Fresno. Anyone outside would have observed it. Well above the plane of the ecliptic.

Red and blue flashing lights in star like object ..IT MOVED;2009-08-22 21:00:00;45 minutes;Red and blue flashing lights in star like object ..IT MOVED I was telling my son in law about a star like object that I had seen for the last four nights, in the same  northwestern portion of the sky.  I had watched this light for approx 4 hours the first night. It looked like a star but through binoculars it was clearly pulsating blue and red lights with a white light in the center. It did not appear to move but though it looked as though it was very far away it shown very brightly. On this fourth night I shared the binoculars with several people who tried to come up with some explanation. We had just about concluded that as the internet suggested, it must be the refraction of light between us and a planet causing red and blue flashing appearance when the light within seconds moved to the horizon low to the earth but still probably hundreds or thousands of miles away. No planet or star would move in this manner and no aircraft could have covered the distance so quickly. Now I am really wondering what this is and if it will return!;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

At first I thought it might be a spotlight on the ground but soon realized there were too many of the lights to be one spotlight circling. They move fast and in a very wide circle but not a perfect circle and the heavy clouds would prevent me seeing any beams of light but only the lights themselves.

As we noticed them traveling through the air we noticed they were traveling what seemed to be about the same speed as a jet airliner if not just a little faster.  They appeared to be flying well under what a jet airliner would be cruising at. The second light was trailing the the first one by a little distance, perhaps a mile or two at the most.  As they passed over our area there were no jet sounds.  No propeller sounds.  It was complete silence.  The neighborhood was silent so if there were sounds from a jet we would have heard them. After they passed overhead we then ran to the front yard to continue watching them.  They were still bright orange at this time and still no jet sounds.  We watched them for another 30 seconds before one went to a dimmer orange and then a few seconds later the second one dimmed. At the time of this sitting the sun was well below the horizon, and the sky was just about black.  Stars and a passing by satellite could be seen at this time.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

6 glowing white orbs and two military jets sighted, two orbs nearly collided;2013-06-02 21:45:00;10 minutes;6 glowing white orbs and two military jets sighted, two orbs nearly collided saw 6 ufos they were glowing white orbs two flew straight at each other nearly colliding 2 military jets also flew into few at an unknown elevation the larger of the white orbs continued on in a north west direction while the smaller one went out of view going south west the larger one was then intersected by 4 different glowing white orbs while trans versing the sky they seemed very high up and made no noise   the military jets didn't seem to be chasing them but it was very interesting timing that they would show up to see the near collision;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

When out of no where he started to wake me;2013-08-03 23:00:00;7 minutes;I was asleep while my step dad proceeded to go outside to have a cigarette around 11:00 pm.  When out of no where he started to wake me up saying come see this, come see this!  I hesitated and told him unless it was an emergency not to wake me up, but he proceeded to tell me that I had to come see what was in the Sky.   So I finally got up just to get him to stop bothering me, when I stepped out side i was instantly enamored It was a big blue light that moved effortlessly high in the sky almost like a bird, it flew for a little bit in a direction but would effortlessly turn back around to were it started.  It was beautiful and mysterious.  Too big and too bright to be a toy or something controlled by someone below,  It moved like an aircraft but much more elegantly and effortlessly.  Best way to explain it.  I don't really believe in Aliens but whatever it was, I have never seen anything quite like it.   After awhile it seemed like it was falling downwards like an air! plane out of control and then it dissipated.  Below were it has a choice of picking there were lights on the object, the object was a light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two lights of differnt size and brightness traveled in differnt directions and faded out.;2013-08-23 20:30:00;2 minutes;Two lights of differnt size and brightness traveled in differnt directions and faded out. Low in the eastern sky I observed a bright light as bright as Jupiter would be.   Suddenly out of this light came a very small light traveling at a high rate of speed toward the north.   As the small light went away it slowly dimmed out.   At that time I noticed something strange about the big bright light.  It looked like it was falling straight down, then suddenly it began to dim and after about 10 seconds it was gone.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Rectangle lights over N/E Fesno.;2013-11-20 10:30:00;3 minutes;Rectange lights over N/E Fesno I heard a loud steady noise coming from outside.  The noise was a loud hum like if you were close to some kind of giant electrical machine or generator of some sort. When I got outside the humming was all around.  I couldn’t tell which direction it was coming from.  I walked to the front of my house but didn’t see anything.  So I walked to the side of the house and from the corner of my eye I started seeing something what appeared to come out of nowhere. I believe I was looking in the direction of what would be the side of it.  At first it looked like a radio tower up in the air and horizontal.  I could not see the object until it was just going past me which revealed the rear of it.  As the object was passing by the “rear” was coming into view and what looked like little red lights at first turned out to be large rectangular red lights. My best guess with the dimensions is it was 200-300 feet wide x 20-30 feet tall but could not tell how deep it was.  It wasn’t until it stated passing me when I could really see it. There were 4 rectangular lights a least 20 feet high by 50 feet wide. It looked like there may have been other lights that were not on or were dimmed but the 4 bright red lights were in the middle.  The red did not look like fire or rocket blast but like GIANT screens showing just red in perfect rectangles.  Not fire engine red but I guess fire red without the fire. The whole experience lasted about 5 minutes.  No mention of it on the news and I cannot find similar events online.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

A blue-violet light falling and rising to the southeast skies of Fresno.;2014-05-21 21:35:00;1 minute;A blue-violet light falling and rising to the southeast skies of Fresno. I was taking a nap in my room.  When I woke it was dark out already and I decided to go outside to get some fresh air.  It was around 21:35 when I woke and saw my alarm clock before walking out.  As I was headed outside I heard our neighbor call out to my mom in spanish, hey, do you see that over there in the sky? what is that?  As I heard this I paced to get to my mother in our front lawn who was looking to the distance in the southeast direction from our home.  And I saw it. It was a bright blue-violet light, flamelike- like a flare. I watched carefully to try to figure out if it were a place or manmade craft by its signal lights but there were none.  It was just one big blue-violet light. It would slowly change color from blue to violet and back.  And it was falling towards the horizon and slowly out of sight before the houses in the distance.  But as it fell it would suddenly stop and start climbing again, and fall again, with each attept it would rise less until it fell out of sight. All of us were stunned, I knew it wasnt a plane.  What got to me was how it felt, from my perspective like an organic life form stuggling to stay afloat.  Like as if it were slowly passing out or giving up.  For when it rose it did so with almost a pull of spirit until it gave up again.  I have been searching online to see if anyone else could have seen it but I guess it was only us.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Numerous unknown objects flying in a cluster high over California.;2015-01-27 16:15:00;3-5 minutes;Numerous unknown objects flying in a cluster high over California. It had just rained in the morning and now in the afternoon the sky was clear and without haze.  The time was between 1600 and 1630 about an hour before the sun sets.   I was in my backyard working in the garden when I happened to look up and see some seagulls circling above.  Then further up in the sky a bright spot caught my eye.  Then another one and another until there was a bunch of them.  They were traveling northwest to southwest from my location.   At first I thought they might have been airplanes but I could not make out any wings.  They were very high in the sky so I thought maybe that might be why I could not see any.  The light I saw from them appeared to be reflection of the sun from something metallic. Most were not blinking but rather shown steady as a reflection.  However, there were a few in the center of the cluster that had a red glow that increased and decreased in intensity.   They were not in any formation.  They were scattered in an elongated bunch, some apart, some were close together.   After a minute or so I decided to try and count them. I got to ten but started to lose the front ones flying into the southwest.  I estimate that there were maybe 18 to 25.   They looked like stars.  Some brighter than others, but flying as a group.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Luminous objects over Fresno, CA.;2015-05-10 20:00:00;5-7 minutes;luminous objects over Fresno, CA This is a sighting from a few months ago I documented it in writing at the time so the details are correct. While riding as a passenger in a car in a residential area of the Tower District of Fresno, CA, I saw a strange light in the sky and asked the driver to pull over for us to get a better look at it. It was dusk, verging on night, so we got a good view of twenty or more luminous objects meandering across the sky from north to south, as if in a disorganized squadron.  The light from the objects was similar in effect to a candle or firefly there was no sound at all. We watched this display for about 5 to 7 minutes, until each UFO was out of sight.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
1st it was coming from the south heading NW, there was 1 white light and 1 yellow light. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.

Suddenly the object looked like it stalled, a very bright light came on and the object headed due west with a very bright light on.  The light looked like it was about 90 degrees and appeared from the ground to be 100' in length and 50' in width at the widest point.  No sound from phenomenon heard.  No clouds in sky, no wind.  Craft was emitting a fog which turned bluish, green as it dissipated.  We sat in awe.  We looked at the bluish green cloud left behind which appeared above our barn roof.  I took a picture of that.  Then we got up and looked west and still could see a cone shaped light in the distance which eventually disappeared.  We smelled something strange.  This ages of the persons who witnessed this are varied.  6, 58, 64 and 83.  We all were setting out side enjoying a fire.  The smell mentioned above is doubtful that it came from the fire.  All that! was burning in fire was wood, ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

White lights in Fresno sky.;2016-03-01 16:34:00;2 minutes;White lights in Fresno sky. I was looking south, and noticed what I thought was a bright star or planet in my peripheral vision above a large tree.  Turning to look south-southwest, I noticed that the light was not one but two lights, and they were traveling parallel to the horizon, in an apparent western direction.  The lights were bright white, similar in intensity to an aircraft landing light at a distance, but no sound was noted.  I called to my wife, who was standing inside the house, and turned back just in time to see the lights blink out, one by one.   My wife did not see them.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Bright neutral white light seen travelling several miles across Fresno until fading out.  ((anonymous report));2016-09-29 20:00:00;~5 minutes;Bright neutral white light seen travelling several miles across Fresno until fading out. I was outside and casually looked up at the sky.  I immediately noticed a very bright light moving from West to North East over North West Fresno.  I was immediately in awe because the speed and brightness of the (neutral) white light.  It was roughly 3-4 times larger than any star in the night sky and was much bigger than any other plane in the area, even at a distance.   I kept my gaze on the light until I noticed the light start to dim and fade.  It was bright, yet not blindingly, until it slowly faded into complete darkness.  I lost track of it after that.   Less than 10 seconds after it disappears, I noticed what appears to be military or authority planes all over the area around where the light had traveled, and they continued to do so for 20+ minutes.

Saw an unidentified seemingly intelligent white orb or object moving along the surface and under water while camping at Pine Flat Lake.;2016-11-14 01:00:00;1 hour;Saw an unidentified seemingly intelligent white orb or object moving along the surface and under water while camping at Pine Flat Lake. I was camping by myself at Trimmer campground on Pine Flat Lake in the Sierra Nevadas.  I woke up at 1 A.M after falling asleep in my car to warm up.  When I woke up I looked down at the lake and saw a very bright white light shining bright sitting right on top of the water on the edge closest to me.  I reached for my phone which showed it was at 6% and I brought it up to take a video and it died immediately.  I didn't want to scare it away by starting the car to charge my phone, so I watched without taking my eyes off of the object for about an hour.  It was very bright, white when I first saw it and over some time it dimmed down at times going underwater and moving around.  When it went underwater I could still see the light smaller and less bright underwater moving.  Eventually, I thought it had disappeared and I had to get out to use the restroom.   As I opened the door, I kept my eyes on the lake.  It reappeared very bright, right when I opened the door. Then it! dimmed and shot under water and further away.  I used the restroom got back in the car and continued to watch the seemingly intelligent orb or unidentified object reacting to the noise I had made.  On the right side of the lake, there were two blinking lights signaling boaters to avoid something floating in the water.  The unidentified light lined up next to the flashing lights and started flashing, as though mimicking the flashing lights.  It then traveled mostly underwater, at times peaking up further away until I could not see it anymore.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Saw a very bright light that seemed like it was a star at first but was much bigger than a star.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2018-12-19 04:00:00;40 minutes;I woke up at approximately 4:00am after having a very weird dream and went downstairs to get water.  As I was getting water, I looked out my window and saw a very bright light that seemed like it was a star at first but was much bigger than a star.  I went back to bed but decided to go back downstairs and outside to record this light.  As I recorded the light, it seemed to be shape shifting or moving somehow but staying relatively in the same position. I am aware that there were several reports of a comet being seen on this same day, but those sightings were seen in the evening of 12/19/2018 and my sighting was in the early morning on this day.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
