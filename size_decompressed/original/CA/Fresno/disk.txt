18 year old girl encountered an alien spacecraft coming home from the Clovis Community College Center on Nov. of 1999;1999-11-23 19:56:00;08:01pm ((5 min.  ));18 year old girl encountered an alien spacecraft coming home from the Clovis Community College Center on Nov. of 1999 I encountered one, last year in middle of November.  I was coming home from my math class that was held every Tuesday nighs from 6:00pm to 8:50pm at the Clovis Community College Center.  This one specific evening, I was taking an important Math exam and I didn't finish my last problem until 7:53pm.  By the time I got into my car, the time was exactly 7:56pm.  I started to turn the ignition on, I turned on my headlights, I turned the heater on and made sure that my doors were secure locked.  I put my reverse gear in, and backed out of the dark, cold desereted parking lot.  I turned left on Fir Ave.  Then, I turned another left onto Peach, where there's a Honda North dealership at the corner.  On Peach, I made a right turn to E Herndon then made a left turn on Willow.  As soon as I got onto Willow, that's when the UFO encounter happened.  I was driving along Willow when I put the right signal on, to turn into my residents.  That's when this bright white lights shot through my windshield.  The object was real similar to the incident that occured on July 24th, 1997 that had occured in Clovis, CA.  The object did not appear to have any sounds, but it was their blocking my view.  I kind of panicked because I've never seen such bright white lights before.  I braked lightly and pulled over to the right curb.  I then looked around the sky, but apparently the object had diappeared.  Since then, I'm always looking up in the sky to hope one day that I will see one and able to post my encounter on this anonymous forum.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
bright lights;2000-12-07 19:56:00;20:01pm;bright lights One night, I was driving home after class (Clovis Center Community College) and as I was driving, this bright white light shot through my wind shield and for a few mins, the lights blinded me.  I was totally freaked out because I've never seen such white bright lights before!!!  As I pulled over to the right curb, I looked up once more and the disc was gone.  It couldn't have been the street lights because every single one of the lights were dead. I encountered another disc out passed Bakersfield, California.  My mother and I were coming from a trip to Los Angeles and as she was driving, I was glacing through the sky when I encountered a round, circle craft.  It appeared one second and the next minute it disappeared.  This went on for like at least 30 mins or so.  I might add that the craft was changing colors, but it was appearing one second and then disappearing the next minute. ((name deleted));36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

I saw a bright, pinkish shaped saucer high in  the sky moving slowly.;2004-08-30 20:30:00;about 30 minutes;I saw a bright, pinkish shaped saucer high in  the sky moving slowly. My grandparents, my brother, and I were going to my great-grandmas house after dinner at about eight thirty. I looked out my window and saw a bright, pinkish saucer shaped sign in the air. I ignored it because I thought it was just a sign.  Then, about five minutes later, I realized a sign couldn't be up that high. I looked out my window again and saw it again almost like the sign moved. I didn't tell anyone at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Many lit up flying objects in the sky that my digital camera found.;2005-09-17 19:30:00;3 min;Many lit up flying objects in the sky that my digital camera found. I was just randomly taking shots of the sky with my Kodak digital camera.  (Thought I could get some nice cloud shots) The sun was just beginning to go down.  It was still pretty light outside.  When I looked at the view picture on the camera I saw these.  We could not see them at all with the naked eye.  I was just blindly pointing up and clicking.  So I did it again and again until they were gone. I never thought I'd ever get pictures like this.  It was just strange because you could NOT see these lighted objects with the naked eye.  Only when we looked in the preview screen did we see them. I have played around with the program I have installed on my computer and I can definitely tell that these ARE mechanical objects.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

When reported the tower control men said he saw it.;2014-05-30 19:00:00;All night;When reported the tower control men said he saw it. On May 30, 2014, I happened to look out my window and saw a low flying object over my nneighborhood, at first I thought it was a plane but I said it's to low so I grabbed my binoculars a went outside and what I saw was no plane it was a flat round object that had multi colored lights all around it.  The object traveled N then turned E went up high then SE when it traveled SE another object followed it as to give chase  then stopped.  The main object still traveling finally stopped in the SE sky.   After about 30 minutes the main object started to travel back to my area traveling now NW coming low once again I then saw a small plane traveling N, it seem when the object came close to the plane it retracted back to the SE sky.  I then tried to call my local airport but no answer, I then called a local news room while I was speaking to the woman I saw other objects flying high in the eastern sky giving off bursts of light or flashes the woman thought I was nuts and hung up.   I then called Lemoore air base they told me to call my local 911 so I did so they in turn connected me to the fresno airport tower and after telling them what I was viewing and the location of the object in the SE sky changing color he then said hold on as he looked for it he told his co-workers what the report was and he said to them I'm dead serious  He the picked up the phone and said that he could see it as well he then told me to call 877 787 7444 Bigelow arrow space  ((sic.  Aerospace)) I said okay and hung up I then called the number but it was a bunk line.   There is something going on in the eastern sky of fresno and it must be looked into ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
