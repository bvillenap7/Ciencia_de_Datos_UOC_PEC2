South on Highway 5, rectangular object w/blue lights charged the freeway -- thought it was going to run me off the road.;2000-08-11 21:30:00;1.5 min;South on Highway 5, rectangular object w/blue lights charged the freeway -- thought it was going to run me off the road. Driving south on Highway 5 in California, just south of Fresno area. At first I thought I saw a plane coming in to land just ahead of me off the freeway, but it was flying way too close to nearby houses, and there was no airport nearby.  Then the object looked like it landed, but shot up in the sky, flipped around, almost in a full circle. I watched it swing out towards the fields I was driving past, then turned and seemed to CHARGE THE FREEWAY.  It was a rectangular object -- about as long as a pickup truck. It consisted of nothing but this grey strip. It had about five lights on it -- when I saw it in the distance they were white.  When it was coming towards the freeway, they were blue.  It was heading east towards my car, I thought this thing was going to run me off the road.  It was flying extremely low to the ground.  I just kept driving, and I passed it.  I was going about 70 mph.  I lost sight of it after that -- I kept driving but could see no sign of it in any of my car mirrors.  It seemed to disappear.  I looked around at the other cars on the freeway to see if anyone had seen it -- no one else stopped.  I flipped on the radio to see if anyone reported seeing the same thing.  I am unaware of any reportings. There was a heavy meteor shower that night, I saw lots of shooting stars. This happened just as it was getting dark.  When I saw it look like it was landing, it was late dusk -- by the time I had driven past it it was dark.  This thing maneuvered in ways I've never seen aircraft be able to do -- it was definately not a plane, jet or helicoptor. Time and locations are close approximations.

Rectangle over Fresno, California.;2004-10-11 18:00:00;2 minutes;a rectangle over fresno california. i was walking back from my gym and a shooting star sparked my eye.  then when the star faded i noticed something blocking out the stars.  i was able to see a REALLY dim orange red light at each four corners and a much bigger one in the middle with the same color but it faded on and of.  i seen it was a rectangle and it was very very huge.  because i was crossing the street at the time a woman in a car was waiting for me to fully walk across.  when i seen her i pointed inda sky and when she seen the object she asked me what i was, and i replied i don't know, a UFO.  then she got on her phone and took off.  when the UFO flew overhead i heard what sounded like vibration.  it was moving slow and you wouldn't see it unless you actually are lookin for sumthin in th sky.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
4 unknown flying crafts were following our car and another one hovered over our neighborhood when we got home.;2009-01-21 19:00:00;3 minutes;4 unknown flying crafts were following our car and another one hovered over our neighborhood when we got home. My husband and I for the last 2 1/2 months have been seeing strange hovering objects in the sky beginning Nov. 3rd 2008. The last sighting was last night around 6:45 pm. We were driving west on McKinley ave in Fresno CA on our way to a meeting. We noticed 4 hovering objects at a stand still on each side of our car about 3 miles up in the sky when we were at a red light. Once our car started moving they moved along side us, every time we stopped they stopped. They all looked alike and did not look like helicopters and not planes. Later on in the evening on the way back home we spotted another craft similar to the ones earlier just hovering at a stand still above the houses in our neighborhood. the object even brightened its lights from red to super bright white. it was still for about 3 minutes then slowly started to move to the right, then left then it either vanished or we just did not catch it take off. This is not the first time we have seen these objects in the sky. we seen larger ones the size of two commercial planes before. We just find it strange that the sightings have not stopped. Our children, my parents friends and my mother in law have all witnessed them. For some strange reason these objects have not gone away and seem to be growing by the numbers each day and showing themselves pretty boldly. If anyone has seen them also please post a report, we hope we are not just going crazy over here by ourselves.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Approx. 9:30 I was walking at Woodward Pk in Fresno, in the SE.  ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.  PD));2016-07-27 21:30:00;20-30 seconds;July 27th aproximitly 9:30.  I was walking at Woodward park in Fresno, California, on the road, I would be on the South East end of the park parallel to Friant road. coming from the west were a set of lights that did not look like an aircraft, it caught my attention, its path was headed straight over my location as it got closer I realized that it was making absolutely no noise, there was no sound what so ever. There were three to four lights on or near the front of it that projected forward off its rectangular shape, they were slightly Amber in color, as it went over head the underside reminded me of what a car would look like if it was up in the air and I was looking up at it.  There were a few more lights sparatically positioned in the underside and there was clearly white vapor or&nbsp propulsion trails, aproximitly 4 or 5 shooting behind it but they weren&apost very large. It was flat and rectangular with definitions of design underneath but in size it&nbs! p appeard to be about the size of a large commercial buildings foundation. It was moving at a steady spread and was not racing towards earth and did not apear to be something burning up in earth atmosphere, as it passed over head I noticed the brightest White light facing backwards from the rear of it, it looked like a giant cone shaped flood light and it was pure white. It crossed Friant road and headed towards Clovis and the hills and appeared to me to be loosing altitude the lights in the front seemed to redden as it got further away from me and it was definitely arching downward a little. I thought it might be heading towards the ground i wasn&apost sure, this did not look like space debre nor any man made aircraft. My view of it lasted aproximitly 20-30 seconds.
