30 years ago large ufo with stinger like object emitting sparks then sped away.;1969-07-07 22:00:00;2 min;30 years ago large ufo with stinger like object emitting sparks then sped away. Approx. july 1969 (before moon landing) My friend and I saw a craft slowly come into view making slow zig zag patterns in the south eastern sky above fresno. it came down to approx. 500--1000 feet. the shape was hard to make out but it looked part retangle and part saucer with a dome shape on top. As it seemed to stop moving we noticed the dark outline of what we called a stinger protruding from the bottom center of the craft. The craft looked to be about 125ft long and 35ft high, the stinger looked about 20ft long. after it stoped a lite shower of dull sparks (embers) emitted from the bottom of stinger in a cone shape. the glowing died out as the embers fell. (it looked like the embers from professionl fire works as they fall to the ground and slowly die out). the craft had lights and what looked like windows on different levels and most of the length of it. After the ember showers the craft started its zig zag pattern but going away from us. We would look at each other than look back up and everytime we did this the craft would start moving faster and further untill the last time we looked at each other and looked up-- it had diapeared.(we did not know at the time that this was a typical reported movement). We also swore to each other that we would not tell anybody because they would think we are crazy. today when I do tell the story to a select few all I get is rolled up eyes and looks that I am crazy.    My friend and I were about 17 years old at the time and we were not on alcohol or drugs. I have been a full time professional Firefighter for 30 years. I know airplanes, helicopters and weather balloons, obviously this was none of those. I forgot to say there was never any noise made by this craft and it was about 10 pm. We were not into ufo's back then and did not have any preconception of ufo's. one night about 5years ago I was listening to the art bell show and I thought I heard a caller say something about a ufo they saw with sparks emitting from the bottom but it was the end of ! the conversation and I was half asleep. Ive wanted to tell this story for along time. I hope to hear from somebody that has seen the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

Three Red lights observed hovering over Fresno, California;2003-10-21 19:40:00;30 Seconds;Three Red lights observed hovering over Fresno, California I stepped out onto the front porch of my home.  In the southerly sky, I saw 3 red lights in the shape of a flattened V or boomerang.   The lights did not blink nor move and glowed steadily for approx. 30 seconds. It was dark, however, the lights did not appear to be part of the same object as I saw no solid mass between them.  After 30 seconds, they quickly dropped below the treeline and out of sight. They made no audible noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Irregular shaped silver object;2005-05-15 13:17:00;30 Seconds;Irregular shaped silver object While working in my garden I was looking at a airliner or big jet with a vapor trail when I noticed this silver or stainless steel object what appeared to be of an irregular shape.  It looked like the main object was a sphere with other undefined things connected to it.  Also there was a dark blackness within the outer edge of the main object.   As I was looking at it I could see the jet behind it and the jet was about twice the distance as the object from me.  I could see the wings of the jet as well as the tail (it was well defined).  The object was much clearer as it was a lot closer and was a little larger than the jet.   The object was going from the east to the west about at the same pace as the jet.   I went into the house to get my camera but when I returned all I saw was a somewhat of a blur that streaked across the sky from about the last place I saw the object traveling to the north west.  The object was gone but the jet was still there.  I new I should have just stayed watching it and forgot my camera.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
LIghts creating triangular like shapes across the sky and small lights following what appears to be jets or commercial airplanes.;2005-06-06 23:00:00;a couple minutes;LIghts creating triangular like shapes across the sky and small lights following what appears to be jets or commercial airplanes. I noticed something was a little off because my dog was acting strange and it was unuasually windy outside.  So just out of curiosity, I stepped outside and sat on some stairs and I looked up at the sky and there was about 3 solid lights moving slowly.  Around this time the dog started to bark and act kind of manic, once and a while sitting and looking up at the sky.  I became interested so I stayed a while outside and the same amount of lights appeared like 10 minutes later but forming a triangular shape across the sky.  Then later on around midnight, I started to notice that there where jet like sounds and two lights appeared together.  One light was small and unchanging and was following another craft that looked like a commercial ariplane.  Both were moving in the same direction at apparently the same speed.  I became scared so I went inside, where I kept hearing a couple minutes of jet-like sounds followed by about 5 min. interludes of silence, then starting back up again.  The same thing has been happenening since then untill today and in the day some people and I have been noticing the jet sounds in the same way I described above throughout the day.  Maybe its normal, I don't know.  By the way, my dog is still acting kind of strange, eventhough I took him to the vet to see what was wrong.  That didn't help.  Another thing, I tried to record but the battery went dead and when I charged it, the camcorder didn't want to record and kept ejecting the tape.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Fresno sighting;2009-10-14 01:30:00;1 MIN;Fresno Ca sighting i was coming home late, my fiance was driving and i was just looking at the stars when i see these stange lights, it'll be a little hard to explain, 1st i seend this giant ball of elevctricity pulsating & throwing sparks everywhere, s we turned around because my finace said it was a transformer blowing. but not how they usually do, i mean it was huge! so we went back and all the chloride (i think thats what its called) was blown all over the road. so we just started heading back home, and we believe something else is out there but weve never seen anything, so we were just joking saying, wouldnt that be crazy if it was a UFO and it charged itself up off that electricity & thats what made it blow up like that. well not even 2 min later driving i seen 3 greyish lights, like picture two squareish diamond shaped lights, while it was slowly gliding straight ,one on the left and one on the right, spaced out then another in the middle but lower and then the left & r! ight ones (while the middle one stayed) would expand out and slowly contract back, then the whole thing would like glitch foward. so we were wondering if maybe it wasnt recharging it just got crossed with the electricity & messed the ufo up because it seemed like it was having difficulties or something. but this happened for about 1-2 min. but i live in the country so a bigrig came up behind us & had bright lights so by the time he passed i looked back up & he was gone! did anyone else around fresno see this? my fiances dad came in the next ming saying him & all his workers sw something that morning too. i couldnt get no pictues as my camera is only 1.3 on my phone. all the other posts read are way different but im 110% sure this was nothing tha couldve been mistaken.

Blackish odd shape over north Fresno, CA.;2014-02-01 15:43:00;<1 minute;Blackish odd shape over north Fresno, CA. On Saturday February 1, 2014, at 3:43 pm north Fresno, CA, I saw what at first I thought was a large black bird coming from the west toward me and my wife, but as I looked it did not have flapping wings.  It did change shape somewhat, not much.   I went into my garage and retrieved my 50X binoculars to get a better look.  What I saw was a black object that seemed to be a jumble of mix of cubes and other shapes mostly black but not completely.  It looked as if it was mottled with black and no color.  The object was tumbling with the sun reflecting and this was why it appeared to be changing shape.  I came to the conclusion that it must be a bunch of balloons as the tumbling seemed to be effortless.   As I was breathing heavy from yard work it was hard to get a very stable look with the binocular.  I looked around to find something stable my shaking.  Not finding anything I looked up without the binoculars and could not find it.  I asked my wife where it was as she was watching it only with her eyes.  She said it just disappeared, was there and then gone.   The object was traveling west to east at about 25 mph and was about 500 feet above us.  The weather was clear and no wind at all.  The object appeared to have a flat path not going up or down.  It’s hard to say what size it was but I would guess it was 20 feet across.  It was not a uniform shape.  Also no sound.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

Bright square lights in the western sky.  Went straight up then set down over the horizon.  I saw it and so did everybody on the jet airplane taking off from Fresno.  I suspect this will be on the nightly news as there was no way that I was the only one who saw this.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
02/04/2016, Fresno, CA, Doughnut, 4-5 min, hovered, then landed super quick in front of vehicle, huge round craft, brown/gold, vanished;2016-02-04 01:50:00;3-4 minutes;02/04/2016, Fresno, CA, Doughnut, 4-5 min, hovered, then landed super quick in front of vehicle, huge round craft, brown/gold, vanished Mr. X Documentary File # 00701  THE CRAFT This is to document the factual events that occurred on or about 02Apr16, at or about 1:40am, in Southern California in the city of Fresno.  The occurrence was witnessed by, and is conveyed by sworn testimony equivalent to, and with all judicial authority, as stated under oath by the signed witness, Mr. X.  There are several items preceding File #00701, including and limited to one drawing of Object ABC articulated by Mr. X in the presence of a close kin.  After explanation to kin about Object ABC, Mr. X was asked by kin if he could draw, or recite details of Object ABC.  Mr. X did articulate the main features of Object ABC on an old small paper bag.  That image was then destroyed.  There is a second document articulated by Mr. X detailing the occurrence encountering Object ABC. As Mr. X was exiting the freeway into Fresno, California, using GPS from his phone as he navigated to his destination.  The GPS on the phone he was using began giving false readings, and performing out of its normal functional character.  Mr. X attempted to adjust the GPS as he drove on the off-ramp from Freeway 99 into Modesto, CA.  About 50 to 100 feet from completing the exit ramp, Mr. X saw a strange thing seemingly hovering off to the left of the exit over-pass.  As he began to focus on the object, the object seemed to flip, or slip, or shape-shift, landing in the middle of the road, on top of the over pass, directly in front of Mr. X’s vehicle.  He stopped the vehicle before running into the object. Mr. X stopped the vehicle, and tried to comprehend the sight of the huge craft, and make sense of what he was seeing.  He tried to wake his children, and co-passenger.  One 16-year old son sitting in the front passenger seat, one 14-year old son sitting in the rear passenger seat on the left side, and one female 18-year old female passenger sitting behind the driver’s seat.  All passengers were asleep at the time of the sighting.  Mr. X tried to wake everyone up, and even shook his son sitting next to him.  Mr. X began to speak aloud thinking that someone may be awake and listening, “what is it?  Look at this you guys.  What do I do?  I don’t understand.  What am I supposed to do?”  He asked.  When no one responded, he tried once again to wake his son, then decided to do something he thought might be stupid.  He thought that he couldn’t leave this moment without being absolutely sure that what he was seeing was real, and with no obstruction between his own eyes and the stran! ge object.  (He didn’t want to wonder in the future, because he knew he was seeing something that he never had seen before.)  He stepped out the vehicle with one leg, and stared at the huge object, with one hand on the door as he stood straight up.  He looked at the object for about what seemed to be 7 to 11 seconds, only looking into the vehicle for a split second at his passengers, and asking if they could wake up, then looking back at the object.  Just then a vehicle horn honked and when he looked back, he noticed there were two vehicles stopped behind him, and a third pulled off to the right.  The Third car was the vehicle that was honking.  At first, Mr. X thought that they were honking at him to get back in his vehicle before the strange craft did something to hurt him. (like he was crazy for standing out in front of the craft like that, so close.) Mr. X looked again at the craft as he got back into his vehicle, and as he clasped his seat belt, the huge craft just vanished in the plume of faint smoke or gasses, which quickly dissipated.  The Thing that Mr. X is calling smoke, or gassed, can a! lso be called a mist, and even visible fumes, or a cloud of something.  This action of the gasses had a visual effect something akin to a visible fume, without a smell, and was all around the craft. Mr. X then began to proceed the remaining 15 yards, or less on the off-ramp to the light.  He continued to look for the object, and look at his GPS to find his way.  The GPS still did not give correct magnetic north, flipping and changing routes sporadically.  He drove from memory, until calling his friend that he was going to visit, and having the friend guide him to his friend’s home. Mr. X pulled into his friend’s driveway in about 8 minutes after that.  As soon as Mr. X passengers began to awake, he began talking about the Strange Craft.  The first thing he said to his friend after saying a brief “Hi.” Was “I just saw an Alien Space Craft”.  The friend just thought he was joking, but he wasn’t joking at all, and as Mr. X began to walk, he lost control of his legs, and became weak.  The friend had to hold Mr. X up and assist him in regaining balance.  The passengers, Mr. X, and the friend all entered the home, and went out back to sit in a rest area of the home for a moment. The Craft was huge, Brownish-Gold, with tints of Green, Red, and Lots of Black.  The texture was Hexed, or X / cross hatched, with some kind of braces running vertical along either side curving with the surface of the craft from top to bottom.  The braces were of the same color, and were about three and a half lanes apart, on either side from the center where I was.  The craft was about 50 to 60 feet high, and obscured at the top and sides with the strange black cloud, or fumes.  At the bottom of the craft, about a foot and a half off the ground was pitch black, where the outline of the craft could be seen as it hovered close to the road.  The craft did block the view of anything behind it, and the street under it.  The craft made no sound, and had no smell.  Just an eerie silence.  Mr. X did get out of the vehicle, and look at the craft with his own eyes, and he did have glasses on so he could see the craft very clearly. The craft did appear from hovering off to the left of the freeway, and did move very quickly (impossibly quick), and stopped on a dead stop in the center of the roadway.  The craft did vanish, with the gas or smoke leaving a few seconds after the craft vanished.  The roadway became clear and lit, and the yellow center, and white lane lines became visible all the way across the overpass, where Mr. X was to drive. This is the sworn testimony, and statement of Mr. X, who is identified yet requests to remain anonymous for as long as possible.  The events described within this report are true and accurate to the best of my recollection, and in in no way fabricated, or made-up.  I swear to what I saw, and I am MR. X.  I have no understanding for what I saw, and I know that the nature, and actions of this strange craft was not of anything that I have seen on Earth. I hope this report helps, as I was asked to document the events of the evening on which I saw this Strange Unidentified Craft.  Signed:  Mr. X;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
A large double Boomerang shaped Metallic UFO spotted over Fresno, Ca.;2019-10-13 19:00:00;10 minutes;A large double Boomerang shaped Metallic UFO spotted over Fresno, Ca. On the night of October 13, 2019 around after 7 PM in Fresno,Ca.I was outside in my backyard I had my NIKON D3300 Camera when I noticed to the West I saw this star like object moving in a steady speed so, I started taking photos.  I then noticed it turning right going South. It was silent. After losing sight of it later, I heard  Helicopters maybe two but, was unable to see them I guess due to the fact I had tall trees in my yard.  I proceeded to go inside my house.  I was the only witness.  When I saw this object up close on my computer I saw that it was very odd.  It looked like two Boomerangs together but with space in between the two.  The object/s looked wide, dull and very metallic with high lighted areas on the ends of this craft whatever it was.  I never saw anything like this. I never heard of a double Boomerang object?  During that week it was a full Moon but, I do not remember seeing the moon that night.  I will submit my cropped zoomed in and highlighted photo of this object in email  Thank You;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
