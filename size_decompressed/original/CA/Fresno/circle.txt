BIG red blinking circle above Fresno,CA;2006-12-07 18:10:00;5 min.;BIG red blinking circle above Fresno,CA I was going outside to get some change out of my truck to walk to the store an get a soda. Well when I walked outside I looked up at the sky (something I always do now ever science I watched another ufo fly around for about 2.5 hrs. in the mountains w/2 other people) and about 10:00 in the sky  Facing east I saw a small grouping of red blinking lights in about .5 inch space in the sky, Well this was way to close for it to be seperate planes but way to big to be a single aircraft, then as I stared more red lights began to show in a sync counterclockwise motion this is when I was like ((deleted))!  Thats #2 I thought in my head,well the lights went around in sync counterclockwise in 1 BIG Circle(Id have to say it was the size of a city!!I  mean miles!) and it was gone.  This is the same day of the launch, and I just heard on t.v. that it was cancelled.  I swear my lower jaw was glued to my chest. Well belive this or not its up to you but I know the truth.  There is nothing I could do or say to prove this unless you know me,but I am no ((deleted)) liar and I dont need to make  friends or attention-;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Glowing bluish- green ball of light  flying west to east at rapid rate of speed.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2009-02-13 18:30:00;2-3 seconds;Glowing bluish- green ball of light  flying west to east at rapid rate of speed I was driving due east on a dark street when a bluish-green ball of light flew directly over my car from behind me (west) at a very high rate of speed. It was a little smaller than the diameter of a traffic light across 4 lanes of road and had no tail or other lights, just a glowing ball of unearthly light.  The sky above me was clear but it's direction was toward the Sierra Nevada mountains which were shrouded in clouds. I couldn't tell if it simply disappeared or was obscured by the distant clouds. Nor could a tell if it was small and close or large and at high enough an altitude to fly into the clouds. No sound was heard. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??

Blue ball falling from high alt.  At 30 ft off the ground, it turned to a red ball and flew off to the E.  Definitely not a plane.;2014-10-05 02:30:00;5 minutes;Blue ball falling from high altitude at 30 feet off the ground it turned to a red ball and flew off to the east. definitely not a plane. While driving a tractor trailer north on I-5.  Between the Bakersfield turn off and the Fresno turnoff.  I don't know the county or the city area.  I saw a blue light and high altitude.  The blue light appeared to be falling like a rock.  I watched it falling for about 5 minutes.   As I came up on a closed warehouse next to the freeway.  It looked as if this blue ball was going to fall on the warehouse, but when it got about 30 feet off the ground, the blue ball turned red. and it started flying off at an angle away from the warehouse and away from the freeway.   I was approximately 200 feet away from the blue ball at that time.  The blue ball turned instantly red.  It flew off at an angle towards the east.  I was 200 feet away I know it wasn't a helicopter I know it wasn't an airplane it appeared to be about the size of a basketball.  Intense blue that change too intense red I'd like for someone to tell me what the heck that was.  Does that sound like something the military has?   I would estimated I first saw it falling at probably 20,000 feet.  It looked to be approximately the same height as a jetliner that was flying at about the same altitude but many miles away from the blue ball.  I'm sure the blue ball had nothing to do with the airplane.   There was only one other truck on the road going the opposite direction.  I don't think anyone else saw it I slowed my truck down to a crawl, but the other truck Kip gone.   Many of the words may be misspelled I'm using speech to text from my phone to send you this message.  Feel free to contact me. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he reports that the sighting occurred on a Sunday morning at about 02:30 hrs..  We have amended the date above, and assigned a time to the sighting.  PD;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Twelve orange globes in formation over Fresno;2016-12-20 19:00:00;5 minutes;Twelve orange globes in formation over Fresno I saw approximately twelve orange globes hanging in the sky.  I was in the NW part of Fresno looking East at 7 pm.  At first I thought it was Christmas lights but quickly realized they were not attached to a house.  When I pulled back around to get a good look, I saw that they were hanging in the sky hundreds of feet in the air.  They were in formation.  They made no sound.  When I pulled over, another truck had already been parked and was looking at the lights.  They said before I got there, the globes were in a straight vertical line, one on top of the other.  When I first saw them they were not exactly vertical, but the whole group was more or less up and down, hundreds of feet top to bottom.  Then they started to move very slowly into groups of three and four in what appeared to be triangles and the group became more horizontal.  The spacing between the globes was nearly exact.  We watched them for five minutes then they started to fade away one after the other. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.

Moving object with various light intensities;2018-04-01 20:30:00;20 minutes;Moving object with various light intensities Looking up at the sky, we were watching planes fly in different directions.  Looking out into the northeast we saw a bright light that we thought to be a bright star.  It kept on shining with different intensities of light and randomly.  It didn’t have any sort of pattern like a plane or satellite have.  It would shine a white light softly then a couple seconds later the light would intensify, brighter than any of the stars or planes in the night sky.  It continued this cycle of lights traveling east across the sky for about 20 minutes until it disappeared.  It maintained the same color of light the whole time, but the amount of light seemed to be different every time.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

It came out of thin air it like formed into a light right in the middle of the night. It didn’t come across the sky it just started right in the middle by getting brighter then slowly gliding across;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
We noticed two glowing lights moving at the same speed and reached a part of the sky and disappeared.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-15 21:25:00;15 minutes;Me and my wife are always looking at the sky for run.  We noticed two glowing lights moving at the same speed and reached a part of the sky and disappeared.  Following in seconds we saw a cluster of 8, the same lights in a 10 minute period exiting our atmosphere in the same spot as the others.  Lights were to faint and to far away to record.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

Satellite Object;2020-07-19 21:00:00;20 minutes;Drove to the Sierra Nevada foothills around sun set to get some pictures of the comet. Just after dark set in we noticed a satellite object traveling over head.  It appeared to have an unsteady flight.  Wavering and slowing.  It came to a stop.  My sister was able to get 3 pictures of the object.  All 3 pictures had a different appearance.  On 2 of the pictures, the object appears to have a hole in it.  The third picture has structure to it.I guess it could be a satellite, but I do not know of a satellite that would come to a complete stop.  I will include the 3 photo's for your examination.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
