A Rumble over Fresno California, at aproximately the same time as both a craft of some sort and a shooting star with a silver streak.;2000-07-14 03:00:00;not sure, possibly a coup;A Rumble over Fresno California, at aproximately the same time as both a craft of some sort and a shooting star with a silver streak. 	I was in the restroom and I heard a large rumbling sound, like thunder. Then it started to get louder, and car alarms started going off. I pulled up my pants and started to leave the restroom and as I did I noticed that the sound was growing faint. I ran out front, and looked up. I didn't see anything and the rumbling was growing softer. Now I might have contributed this to a storm of some sort, but there was barely a cloud in the sky and the few that were there, were thin and light. Then as the rumbling was almost gone and the car alarms shut off, I saw in the distance a U.F.O. (And when I say U.F.O. I mean Unidentified Flying Object, not a flying saucer nescisarily) of some sorts. It was to far away for me to make out and it seamed to be moving to fast to be a typical plane. As it moved behind some trees (or at least from my perspective), I started scanning the sky for it incase it might have changed course while not in my line of sight. Then from a different angle, what appeared to be a silver shooting star streaked across the sky from my perspective due to my proximity, it was about a foot. But it was a weird shooting star, at least to me. I've never known a shooting star to look silvery, and to appear shoot across then disappear in a small flash. My natural inherit fear due to all the alien obduction tv-movies when I was a young child, caused me to go back inside the house. Then I got right on to my computer and typed this up. One so I would remember it as it happened, and two to convey my experience with the rest of the world. Now I don't know if these were just random phenomena that although was a large coincidence happened. Or if it was a military situation, or even maybe an alien experience. All I know is that this was an experience that I will never forget. July 14, 2000 Typing finished at 3:20am which means the experience was more than about 3:00am Pacific Standard Time Now I can not say for certain that the sound came from the object I saw, but I can say that if it did there was some sort of time delay because I heard the sound seamingly coming from one direction and then the object later coming from the oposite direction.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581

My first sighting of a UFO;2011-12-06 20:34:00;15-20 seconds;My first sighting of a UFO On the night of December 6, 2011, as I am traveling North of Chestnut Ave. coming from Alluvial in Fresno, CA heading to Sonic to buy food for my son, I seen an unidentified aircraft coming at me.  It was around 8:30ish.  There were hardly any stars in the sky, it was dark.  There were no cars in front of me or behind me, but cars coming from my opposite direction.  As I was driving up North towards Nees Ave on Chestnut, I saw a light coming somewhat straight at me.  At first, the thought came to my mind that it is an airplane crashing down, I felt somewhat scared.  I did not want to witness anything extreme at that moment.  The flying object as it descended from the sky, started slowing down and got bigger.  As it was getting bigger and getting close to me (feelings: very scared), I began praying for it to stop or just be close enough that I could see it, but not close to me as to like being in front of me.  I really did not want to get abducted, that was the next thought in my mind.  The UFO aircraft stopped and hovered for a few seconds.  As I was staring at it, my thoughts were “Am I really seeing this?” the feelings of being shocked was trembling in my body.  My eyes were stuck at this unidentified aircraft, trying to figure out what this thing could look like, but all I seen was 3 circular lights, somewhat close together, shaped like a triangle, the lights looked as if it was spinning at a rapid rate, from red and blue, with traces of yellow light as it was glittering and spinning at a rapid rate.  The bottom of the craft looked like it had some rigid form structure around the lights. The UFO aircraft did not look large it seemed somewhat medium/small size.  That was all that I seen from that... After a couple of seconds, maybe 15-20 seconds, it gradually started to move, to the right of my view, and curved up towards the sky.  It was lighting speed, it made traces of white light (like a tail of a star falling from the ! sky, except it was going up) as it ascended to the heavens.  I! never s een anything like it, or have I seen an aircraft as fast as that UFO craft traveled.  I’m still in shocked.  Today is December 8, 2011, 10:31AM.  I’m trying to recall my story of my first encounter of the flying object.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Silent craft hovered 2 story's above me.;2012-12-15 02:00:00;5 minutes;Silent craft hovered 2 story's above me. Approximately around December 13-18, 2012.  Trying to remember because it was a couple years ago Christmas time. early in the morning between 2-3 am. While I was working graveyard as security for a retirement place in Fresno, CA. I was sitting in my vehicle with the window open and stopped under a freeway lamp to do my report and I looked up on a clear night to see this HUGE silent black craft right above me.  I am not sure of the shape it started forming a misty cloud around it possibly vapors or condensation cloud which started to block it from my vision. I remember it had HUGE LED type of lights, more than one they were so bright they kinda had a blue color to them.  The craft was motionless and silent. I remember it being the same night as a very similar craft was seen in Colorado.  This, however, was located directly above the freeway at Temperence Ave exit and the 180 freeway, going towards the airport where NORAD is located in Fresno, CA. Within a couple of minutes after it slowly moved towards the airport, a helicopter flew over where I had seen it. I do know that the freeways here are blocked by local law enforcement whenever they have secretive flights from an unknown agency. My guess is NORAD.  It had to be governmental not alien operated. We are so advanced in technology. Me...I'm retired Law Enforcement. What a sight!  And, I wouldn't have known it was there if I hadn't just looked up.
