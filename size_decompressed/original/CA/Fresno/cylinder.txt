High altitude white object in the sky for a few hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible high-altitude balloon??  PD));2018-05-15 13:00:00;4 hours;High altitude white object in the sky for a few hours. May 15, 2018.  Walking my dogs in a nearby school around 1 p.m. I noticed a white orb sitting high in the sky.  The object was stationary.  The temperature was mild with a nice breeze blowing.  I realized that it was probably not a man made object.  The elevation appeared as high a commercial jet in a regular high elevation flight.  If there was a good wind on the ground then there would be high wind at that altitude.  A balloon of any type could not stay that stationary and any tethering impossible.  After around fifteen minutes the object had slowly drifted towards the West.  I knew my sister had a good high resolution camera with a telescopic lens.  I gave her a call and she saw and photographed it.  The object this whole time was pretty much stationary with a little noticeable drift.  I got home and tried to photograph it with my wife's camera but was not too successful.  I got out my high powered binoculars and could see it fairly good.  The object appeared oval. Insi! de the oval were too round ovals.  In between the two interior ovals was dark dot.  Everything except the black dot was a milky translucent and appeared to be illuminated.  I bring this matter too your attention now because I did not knew that it was reported to a local news station.  KMPH channel 26 Fox news.  There report can be seen on You Tube under the heading of: 2 UFOS OVER FRESNO  KMPH 26 NEWS MAY 15TH VIDEO SEE DESCRIPTION! I have my sister's photo if you are interested.
