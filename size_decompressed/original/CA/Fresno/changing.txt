Three objects in the sky.;1990-10-05 22:00:00;1-2hours;Three objects in the sky. This happen about fifteen years ago and is still as fresh in my memory if it had happen today.  My girlfriend was helping me relocate back to coalinga from fresno, ca. It was about 10:00-10:30 at night.  We were driving on the outskirts of Fresno when I notice this bright very fast moving object in the sky. We tried to follow it, but it was difficult to keep up with this object.  At one point it stoped and seemed to divide into three objects. There was a fruit orchard on the passenger side of the road, the object hovered then disappered into the orchard. We turned left and drove til we seen the objects fly out of the orchard. Then we followed them for at least a hour. Then they seemed to notice us and they started to follow us. We could not drive fast enough. Then I remember pulling into a diner very scared.  Later, we recounted our story to my friends dad he said it was a weather ballon.  We never believed this. Also, about six mounths later i was driving and seen this big bright hovering light??? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Objects were sighted driving north on Highway 5 in California's central valley after night fall, not far past Kettleman/Fresno exit s;2001-10-10 21:30:00;15 min. apprx;Objects were sighted driving north on Highway 5 in California's central valley after night fall, not far past Kettleman/Fresno exit sign. The area is farmland for the most part, therefore very dark beside the highway with city lights visable in the distance to the east. Two large blinking lights appeared in the blackness between the road and the city lights. The lights were blindingly brilliant with a bluish cast. We first thought they might be crop-dusting planes, as crop-dusters were still prominent in the news following the Sept. 11 attack. We then decided that they must be something else, given their brilliance and the speed at which the first light suddenly moved toward the south. The second light moved northward, turned toward us but hovered near the roadside as we passed. Shortly, a 3rd light appeared ahead and to the left the highway (same color and brilliance). It then seemed to jump to the right side, instantly. The third light rose to a higher altitude, separated into FOUR distinctly separate lights of equal brilliance and proceeded to move toward the south. Unlike the first light which also moved at what we took for impossible velocity, the third seemed to pulsate twice: i.e., it disappeared only to re-appear INSTANTANEOUSLY further south against the stars, in both cases radically changing shape. It swelled to enormous size prior to vanishing, then re-appeared in smaller mode. After doing so twice, it sped upward and southward at such tremendous speed I could not track its motion with my eye. (I was in the passenger seat, so was free to safely turn my head as it sped away). A combination of features convinced us we had seen no crop-duster, military plane or other easily explained phenomenon: that the light divided into four distinctly separate luminaries, melded into one again and jumped as it moved... then, that it altered size and shape still pulsating through the sky and finally, that it left with unnatural and amazing speed. All told, we observed the third and strangest light for an estimated period of thirty seconds (we did not calculate the length of time).;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Extreme sighting in Fresno California;2004-07-05 19:30:00;45 minutes;Extreme sighting in Fresno California At 7:30 PM we noticed from our backyard 2 triangular shaped orange/yellow objects in to the North East at approx 40,000 feet (  heighth estimated by planes traveling in the area ) As we watched the two craft we noticed that they were traveling at about ( estimated ) 2 miles apart and at times they appeared to change shapes from triangular to an upside V to an elongated object. Also they were in a parellel position then they would change to a vertical positioning from each other.They had a haze around them during the time of sighting. They were fairly stationery and after about 10 minutes of watching they joined up from a vertical position then separated again. They began to move NorthEast  to the Northwest after this separation took place. Once over what was close to being directly over our house they remained stationery for about 10 minutes. They began parellel movement again after that 10 minutes then separated and dissapeared . No sound was noted at all during the duration of this sighting.The craft also changed color at times from a bright orange to a yellow to an almost reddish yellow color . What I found odd as well was our Labrador Retreiver was the one who alerted us to the object . He was playing ball with us and suddenly stopped and looked into the sky in the direction of the objects.He watched for about 40 seconds The event was about 45 minutes in length.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Fast moving small object. Appeared to change shapes at first.;2012-08-13 20:39:00;5-10 minutes;Fast moving small object. Appeared to change shapes at first. Fresno, Ca 8-13-12  I was standing on my porch when I noticed a white light that seemed to be changing shape in the sky.  I proceeded to take several pictures that turned out very clear.  After about 10 minutes of watching the object just sitting still in the sky, other than the apparent shape changing, I looked away and back, only to have the object gone. The object was almost directly west of my apartment complex. This is the second time there has been a strange light hovering above the same point in the sky in a month. In the enclosed picture, I cut the relevant portions out and set them side by side in time order.  I took the shots roughly 3 seconds apart.  The dark object in the bottom right corner is my neighbors AC unit and my point of reference when referencing where I saw the first light.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
A Pink & Green Object changing shape Witnessed in Fresno,Ca;2020-08-05 19:00:00;2 minutes 56 sec;A Pink & Green Object changing shape Witnessed in Fresno,Ca On August 5, 2020 at after 7 PM  in my backyard in Fresno,Ca I had my Panasonic HC V 180 Camcorder when I noticed what looked to be a star like object moving and coming from the W direction then I started videotaping it. As it kept the same speed with no sound it then made a (R) turn heading South. The next town over would be Fowler. I tried my best to keep my camera steady. I noticed it was changing shape and colors. It was pink and green. A man in L.A. in 2015 witnessed the same object I did.  I also have a video still of the object. During this week in August was during the full moon.  Yet, I cannot remember if the moon was out that night.  The night sky was very clear I heard what I thought were two Helicopters but, unable to see them.  By this time, I had gone back in the house. I was the only witness. The object was high. Unknown how high exactly. Probably as high as a small plane would go. Thank You MUFON Video Case # 110752;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
Cigar/Circular object hovering in sky and moving strangely;2021-03-06 14:55:00;5 minutes;Cigar/Circular object hovering in sky and moving strangely I went outside to see the jets flying by. I saw two fighter jets flying northeast. The sky was clear with few clouds. Looking back towards the west I saw a dark brown cigar shaped object. I looked away to see if it was my eyes, and it was still there. It was hovering still. It changed to a circular shape and began moving north in a horizontal motion. It paused again and hovered still. It began moving horizontally north again and I lost it in the tree line. It did not move like a plane or a bird.;36.7800036827196;-119.793156515581
