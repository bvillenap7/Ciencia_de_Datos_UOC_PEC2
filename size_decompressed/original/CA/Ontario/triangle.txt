An observation of three et ships;2009-12-13 23:00:00;10 Min;An observation of three et ships I was Stargazing at orion's belt when i turned around to look at the rest of the stars when i saw something move since i live close to Ontario Intl airport and under the aproach pattern for lax i thought it was a plane but it was too low. i saw the object do a 180 and then hover. then two others appear just behind it one behind and to the left, and the other behind and to the right. then this light appeared on the lead object and gained intensity until they dissapeared before my eyes. they made no sound and left behind a small haze going east;34.037022751798;-117.62208417266

From afar, I see these extremely bright lights.  Hmm..that doesnt seem like an airplane.  Sure enough it flies at a pretty fast speed, slightly above some trees in our backyard.  It's night but I can make out a black triangular shape and the bright lights outlining the shape.   There is a giant bright light in the middle of the craft.  No noise comes with it.  It was about less than a mile above ground and seemed very large in size. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Yes sir. It was Tuesday night, April 29.  At exactly 11:59PM and lasted no more than a minute.  Thank you. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD));34.037022751798;-117.62208417266
