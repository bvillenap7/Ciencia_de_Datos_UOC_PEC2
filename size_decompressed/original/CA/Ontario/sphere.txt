Spherical object seen from commerical airliner over Ontario, CA;2003-09-26 17:15:00;2 seconds;Spherical object seen from commerical airliner over Ontario, CA I was aboard Northwest 337 on a landing approach to LAX at approximately 17:15 flying over Ontario International Airport. I was looking out the window on the left side of the plane and saw a spherical object pass the aircraft traveling on a parallel course in the opposite direction at a high rate of speed. The object was at a lower altitude at about 4 o’clock. The object was silver in color. I estimate the size of the object to be about 10-15 feet in diameter. The size estimate is subjective without knowing how far the object was from the aircraft. I don’t know what the altitude of my aircraft was flying but it could be easily checked.;34.037022751798;-117.62208417266
