huge bright eliptical shaped object with multi colored lights flashing, like millions of sparkling diamonds;2006-03-01 19:00:00;30 minutes;huge bright eliptical shaped object with multi colored lights flashing, like millions of sparkling diamonds I saw a single object that was shaped like a football, kind of squished down a little to be about 2/3 the diameter of a football, elliptical in shape. It was just hovering above a mountain ridge. If I were to draw it, it would be a 15 degree ellipse running in the horizontal position. This object was very large, approxiamtely the length of a 747 airliner or larger and had intermitten flashing colored lights coming from every angle, reminded me of colored lights reflecting of a high quality diamond. It had the appearance of an immense amount of diamonds clustered together to form the above mentioned shape, like nothing I have ever seen before.  I work in the Engineering field in Aerospace and Avionics and I have never before seen anything like this.  My neighbor whom I had gone next door to see and have her look at this so I would be believed, saw pretty much what I saw through the binoculars. She described it as a translucent oval object, extremely large in size and appeared to have what looked simlar to an immense amount of diamond like objects inside, with itermitten lights flashing. We both laughed because it reminded us of the movie Close Encounters of the Thrid Kind in which the ship had these different colored lights flashing and yet they were of such a brilliance that neither one of us had ever seen before.;34.037022751798;-117.62208417266
