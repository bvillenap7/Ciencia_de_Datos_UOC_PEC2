Egg shaped object near Ontario International Airport, in Ontario Ca.;1999-06-15 11:00:00;10 min;Egg shaped object near Ontario International Airport, in Ontario Ca. My sister and I were north bound on Interstate 15 we had just past the limonite exit. I started looking off in the distance past Ontario International Airport. I saw this silver egg shaped object way off in the distance but it was unmistakeable as some sort of flying object. I was looking at it when my sister asked me if I could see it. I said yes I could and it just hovered in the air, then it shot to the left, and back to the right. Then It shot to the east so fast we could not follow it with our eyes, but we could tell that it had gone off to the east. We were quite some distance away. the best discription was of a silver egg shaped object. We heard nothing of any reports in the news paper or on the radio etc. There was an haze that surrounded the object from the distance it sort of looked the way the road does when there is heat commming off of it.
