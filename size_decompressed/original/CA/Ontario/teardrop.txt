UFO over Ontario California;2021-06-05 16:00:00;10 min;UFO over Ontario California Upsidedown teardrop shaped object. I'm about 40 min east of los Angeles and the object was stationary way above the clouds and I was facing east. It was gray and just stayed in one spot for about 10 minutes while planes flew by getting ready to land at lax. My two daughters and I were in our pool when I spotted the object and after a couple of minutes they spotted the object as well.After about 10 minutes it just got smaller and disappeared. Didn't hear any noises or see any lights.About 3 months ago while again we were in our pool at night ..I looked up and told my daughter's and my niece (who is an adult) to look up. At first I thought it was a helicopter but then it started to bounce  towards us. Yes bounce ... Like dropping a ball down a flight of stairs..  all we could see was a bright white light. After it bounced 4 times it shot straight up in a super fast speed .. my niece who doesn't believe in UFO got scared and started to cry;34.037022751798;-117.62208417266
