Mysterious light in the sky over Southeren California;1970-07-15 00:00:00;10 minutes;Mysterious light in the sky over Southeren California In the summer of 1970, I was camping out in the backyard of my grandmothers house and looking up in the sky I saw a white light coming from the east and going west.  Thinking it was a satellite I followed it while watching it another light came from the west heading east on a collision course.  Thinking it was a big explosion about to happen I watched it until they got so close together they became one light, after about 2 mins the light headed south leaving a trail of light behind it and disappeared out of sight.  The two light were about the size of a ball point pin dot on a piece of paper.;34.037022751798;-117.62208417266
Three lights in the sky at the base of Mt. Baldy.;2002-09-16 01:45:00;30 min.;Three lights in the sky at the base of Mt. Baldy. I was sitting in my car talking to a friend when i pointed out to that person, hey check out that UFO! I said it in jest but just as I finished saying it, the UFO (which looked like a ball of light) went out...the ball of light went away, then it lit up again, and then proceeded to go off again...then it moved. My friend noticed the movement first. We proceeded to call my friend's sibling. She came over and got in the car and we showed her where it would be, she looked and it did it again, it illuminated again, then went out abruptly. We got four of our other friends to come outside and see the phenomenon. They arrived and could see the object we were looking at (you could still see a slight outline of a ship with other dim lights attached to it). They thought we were crazy until they saw it light up too. Then out of nowhere a second light appears to the left of the first one. At first they took turns lighting up, then they both remained lit for about a minute solid. They would periodically turn off and turn on again and adjust positions. We could tell they weren't stars because they were hovering in front of a mountain, they weren't planes either...they were flying to low. There was another craft higher up above the two lights that had reddish lights that got brighter...it remained in one position throughout the ordeal...only strafing from left to right every so often. The three lights formed a trangular shape. The other two ships were still moving though...they were getting closer to the ground. My friends all left to go to the mountains to get a closer look, and they saw the lights all the way there. I went home to get my video camera to film it. When I got back to the spot where our first sighting occured the lights had already descended past the horizon which the roofs of the homes in the neighborhood created.;34.037022751798;-117.62208417266
Bright Orange light moving across the sky Eastward vieiwing from Ontario, CA.;2006-09-05 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;Bright Orange light moving across the sky Eastward vieiwing from Ontario, CA. It was a bright orange light.  Moving from West to East, slowly.  It Flashed a bright white light (like a strobe light), then continued on eastward.  It looked like it was burning up, as debris was falling from it.  Continued to glow orange, then flashed the bright white light again, then we could not see it any longer as it moved further east.  It was dark out & planes in the sky as well, looked like they didn't notice it.  It was probably higher altitude then they were.;34.037022751798;-117.62208417266

Light streak over the 10 freeway in Ontario, CA;2019-10-09 17:45:00;3-4 seconds;Light streak over the 10 freeway in Ontario, CA I was driving eastbound on the 10 freeway through Ontario, California, between the Archibald Avenue and Haven Avenue off ramps.  Off the right side of the freeway, I saw a streak of bright, white light suddenly appear and curve downward.  I thought it was a shooting star, but then it instantly changed direction, flew up a bit and disappeared.  The entire thing lasted about three or four seconds.;34.037022751798;-117.62208417266
