From the the moment I got on the 60 fwy I noticed these dark tiny puff clouds undernieth some big semi dark clouds. There were four lined up in a row, and then kind of stacked,but the ones further down kind of witherd away. It baisiclly looked like exhaust. After a half hour of driving we got pretty close to it and that is when i actually saw the smoke being distributed from something. It was a line of smoke, very dark, and then a few seconds latter looked like the other smoke puffs. While the smoke was coming out, right above in the clouds, I saw a line of black dots. It was deffinitly something solid and very large. I know they were not clouds. Something was dispensing that stuff.;34.037022751798;-117.62208417266

Seen from Ontario Mill looking towards the South East.  Very high in the sky, it was shiny - looked like a silver dog dish. It was stationary for about a minute.
