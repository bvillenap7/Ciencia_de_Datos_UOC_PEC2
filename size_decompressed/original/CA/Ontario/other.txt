Orange balloon shaped UFO over Ontario California!!;2012-06-07 00:00:00;10 seconds;Orange balloon shaped UFO over Ontario California!! I was sitting outside using my iPod when I heard a plane flying by.  I look up to spot it but couldn't. I looked around for about 5 seconds when I noticed an orange balloon shaped object.   I thought to myself oh it's just a balloon but it was moving at a steady pace and had an orange light on the back of it.   It would go on for 3 seconds then go off.  On for 3 seconds then go off.  As fast as it came, it left.;34.037022751798;-117.62208417266
Observed a very bright and sparkling star in the eastern morning sky of 9/15/16, moving sporadically.;2016-09-15 04:00:00;>5 minutes;Observed a very bright and sparkling star in the eastern morning sky of 9/15/16, moving sporadically. On the morning of 9/15/16, at approximately 4:00 a.m., I looked to the eastern sky and saw what I thought was the “morning star” which I’ve seen before.  However, this “star” was moving in a sporadic fashion.  I thought it might be a plane or helicopter but it wasn’t.  The “star’s” movement reminded me of a balloon floating in the air.  First it moved slightly to the right, then slightly lowered, then back to the original position and then maybe slightly upward then back to original position.  This pattern of movement was repeated as long as I viewed the “star”.  I must have watched this “phenomenon” for at least 5 minutes if not more.  The “star” shined very brightly in the sky.  Very mysterious.;34.037022751798;-117.62208417266
