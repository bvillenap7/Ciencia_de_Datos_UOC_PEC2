Two fast and low disks haulin' a**;1969-07-04 11:15:00;5-10 sec.;Two fast and low disks haulin' a** I was ten years old. I went outside to the lawn area next to the pool where our apartment manager was setting up tables for later in the day, to have a BBQ and get together. It was still early and no one was setting off their fireworks yet. We lived only 3-4 miles from Moffet NAS.  I heard a very deep rumbling sound which I knew was a sonic boom. But it was deeper and louder than I had ever heard before. We both looked up at exactly the right moment to see two or three eliptical disks swoop over very low and fast. The low one that caught my attention was dull silver on the bottom but burnished orange on the side and top from the reflected sunlight. It was only 150 feet off the ground. They may have been playing 'chicken' to see who could fly lower. The higher one(s), were identical but I did not see any sunlight reflect off of it (them). They were a little bit bigger across than the wingspan of a P-3 Orion sub-chaser, of which I saw everyday in those years. It happened so fast I only got a good look at the lower craft. After they went by I looked at the manager and said Did you see those... I was was going to say, flying saucers, until I noticed his face was white as a sheet. So I said ...rockets. He went inside, probably to get a drink. I thought to myself Well, flying saucers yeah, their real what's the big deal? The only question I had at that time and still have whenever I see ufo's, (14 other sightings) is who does it belong to? Ours or theirs? Whoever these guys are they have a flight path that comes in low from the Pacific in a straight line from Daly City down to Sunnyvale then onward. Fun fact. Line it up on a map and it continues down to Southern Nevada. They usually come in on July 4th or close to it. Examples of other fly-ins I've noticed, 8:30pm 7-2-87 VERY loud boom. Approx. 12:45am 7-5-91. This leads me to believe that it may be a re-supply of some kind for alien personel. As our guys usually have federal holidays off. Fair warning for '03. Try to see them.;37.3740612565446;-122.02055183246
