HUGE Ball of Light Falling from the Sky.  Possible meteor or missile test on California coast.;2003-11-20 17:30:00;6 seconds;HUGE Ball of Light Falling from the Sky.  Possible meteor or missile test on California coast. Was driving south on Hwy 85 from Mountain View heading towards Cupertino.  Saw a HUGE white ball of light falling from the sky over the hills of Saratoga.  It had a long fat tail, and took it's time falling into the earth.  hundreds of folks saw it and were calling KGO radio etc. and TV stations.  I called the San Jose Mercury News,  someone there told me it was a missile test by Edwards Air Force base.  Could have been done at Vandenberg Air Force.  There were sightsing at Monterey Bay.  The only thing in the news about it, said it was a meteor.  I can say that I've never seen a meteor that close and that Huge!!;37.3740612565446;-122.02055183246
Blinking, moving object that traveled with an erratic but repeated pattern in the daytime sky above the silicon valley.;2004-05-02 10:30:00;7 minutes;Blinking, moving object that traveled with an erratic but repeated pattern in the daytime sky above the silicon valley. Object appeared above trees coming from 280 degees true (approx WNW) traveling with a heading of 100 degrees true at an altitude too high to determine a shape, and traveled slowly to a point nearly directly overhead. While moving, the object was blinking with distinct regularity (1 second bright blink followed by 2 seconds dim blink). Object slowed almost to a stop overhead and quit blinking. Object appeared to be a brownish/gray color. Stayed motioness for approx. two minutes. With an immediate change in direction the object started slowly on a heading of  320 degree true and accelerated very rapidly to a speed faster than that of any airborn object previously seen by this observer. Object began a zigzag pattern cotinuing at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view behind trees. Twenty to thirty minutes later (11:15) the object appeared at the same location as originally sighted and began to moving in the same direction (100 degrees true) as before with a different frequency of blinking (1 sec bright followed by 1 sec dim). Object slowed to nearly a complete stop when it reached a point overhead, quit blinking and disappeared from view.;37.3740612565446;-122.02055183246
