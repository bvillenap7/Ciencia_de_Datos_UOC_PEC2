We both noticed an extremley vibrant double rainbow in the sky to the south east. As we both admired the sky, we noticed a flashing sphere like object at about 110* of the brighter rainbow, then two other obejects slightly to the right and higher(125*). Each object seemed to mimic the color of the spectrum it was in, when they would pass from one color to the next it had a very fluid-ey look. The rainbows faded and still the objects where breifley the same colors they had when in the rainbows spectrum, they then seemed to cloak(for lack of a better term) to a dark grey, (much darker than the sky)  We both stood there questioning what we where seeing until all three objects vanished approx 16:28. Each object stayed the same size the entire time, until it was gone. We couldn't believe what we where looking at, it was a site i've never seen.;37.3740612565446;-122.02055183246
