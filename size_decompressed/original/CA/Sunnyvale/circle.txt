Slow horizontally flying noiseless oject with cosmic blue beam suddenly switched off lights, lifted vertically and disappeared;2000-07-07 21:20:00;10 minutes.;Slow horizontally flying noiseless oject with cosmic blue beam suddenly switched off lights, lifted vertically and disappeared Me and my wife were taking a walk after dinner on Friday 7 July  at about 9:20 PM  she showed me something strange in the sky.  It was a noiseless slow moving (horizontally) low flying object. From the bottom of it a very-very bright beam of blue light  was emnating (diameter of the origin of light was about 6 inches).  That divergent beam of cosmic blue light was reaching up to the ground. We stopped as we thought soon the blue light would be upon us.  But then suddenly this thing switched off lights.  It immediately disappeared and the trace it left behind clearly looked as though it suddenly changed its flight direction and went vertically upwards at tremendous speed. Most surprising thing was the the beam of light which it was emnating remained still above our apartment complex for about 5 minutes and slowly faded away. I was excited and stunned because the whole thing didn't look natural. I immediately calledup a friend of mine. He came over to our house and we chatted for quite some time about this. We tried tuning into TV news channels but couldn't find anything about this. At around midnight I searched into web for UFO related links and found that lot of people had reported this strange sighting at approximately the same time from Palo Alto, Los angles, San Diago etc..... I also reported this on that web site.  Responses have started coming in. I don't know what it was but I'll never be able to forget it.............;37.3740612565446;-122.02055183246
