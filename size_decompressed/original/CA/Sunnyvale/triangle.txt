I stepped out for a smoke /    \     and gazed at the night sky as I usually do.  Not the first time I've /  ____  \   seen a craft or strange light in the sky but this is the first /--/    \--\  I've ever reported.  The object was almost V-shaped with a blunt/flat nose, no lights at all, upturned skegs or tail fins at the rear of the craft, dark grey to black in color and made a soft whisp of a sound as it flew by.  At first I thought it was a flock of birds in formation but noticed no voids  between them. The object was solid as it banked/rocked (when I noticed the tailfins) across the sky. It traveled in a south bound direction  (NASA to Santa Cruz) a bit over 1/4 mi. up at approx. 50 mph. Proportionate at 50yds L x W.  Incredible!  Being close to many Air Stations/Ports I've seen my share of planes and sea birds that fly through the night, this was by far one of the oddest occurances I've ever seen.  I do believe in aircraft technology and can't discolse this sighting to any other explanation other than an advanced type of stealth fighter.  Although I've never seen the stealth planes fly in person (other than TV) this craft differed in shape & sound. Impressive.....;37.3740612565446;-122.02055183246
