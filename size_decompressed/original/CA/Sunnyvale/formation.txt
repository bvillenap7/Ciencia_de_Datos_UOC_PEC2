while walking my dog two objects appeared on my left over railroad tracks;2005-09-20 20:30:00;10 minutes;while walking my dog two objects appeared on my left over railroad tracks I was walking my dog when I thoght I witnessed a falling star.  It was a small bright white light. It was dark & I couldn't make out its shape.  It stopped falling and hovered.  While hovering another one came from above me.  It was larger with circling red lights.  This also hovered about a 1/2 mile from me.  At times the smaller one would fly at a great speed and change directions in ways our aircraft can't.  At times the larger vehicle would also do zig-zigs at a great speed and then return & hover.  And just as fast as they appeared, they disappeared.  The whole event lasted about 10 minutes.

witnessed formation of 30-40 dim objects fly in south direction over Sunnyvale, Ca;2010-02-13 19:00:00;15 seconds;witnessed formation of 30-40 dim objects fly in south direction over Sunnyvale, Ca Location:  Sunnyvale, CA Date: 2/13/2010  Time:  7pm   Went out to car to get something, and looked up at night sky to view it nice and clear for first time in a few weeks.  As I looked up, basically straight up but facing west, I noticed a line of dim objects, about 30-40 (I will use rough numbers in my description because of how quick event happened) and my first thought was that it was birds reflecting the city lights, but then the objects split into 3 separate groups, one with about 10 objects, the middle one around 20 and the third (farthest group from me) was maybe about 15, again just rough numbers, I didn’t have time to count!   The group was traveling in a southern direction, from where I was in Sunnyvale, I’d say they were directly over Mountain View, about 2 miles west of me.  That path would take them over Cupertino, Saratoga, then the northern edge Santa Cruz Mountain range (around here we call them the Cupertino and Saratoga hills).  The group was moving at a good rate of speed, it was hard for me to focus on them because they were so spread out, and I was trying to see if I could discern any shape, which vaguely they were each a slight V-shape, but I’m not 100% on that.   The whole sighting lasted maybe 10-15 seconds, and at the end of it they all seemed to group together and fade out, which is why I think they were only reflecting city light and they dimmed out going over the mountains.   A group of birds could not travel that distance that fast across this valley.  I tried to stay focus on the direction they faded out but saw nothing more.  About 30 seconds later I heard a plane and saw its ! flashing navigation lights, in the same west direction I was facing but far lower, I believe small planes over this area have to be around 1500-2000 ft, so using that these objects were higher, but I could not estimate for sure what height.  They made no sound, and moved very quickly in combining and separating their groups.;37.3740612565446;-122.02055183246
