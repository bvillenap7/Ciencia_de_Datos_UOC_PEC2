Reflective silver object, possibly orb or egg shaped flying near some fighter jets this afternoon in Sunnyvale, CA;2008-08-08 15:00:00;60 seconds;Reflective silver object, possibly orb or egg shaped flying near some fighter jets this afternoon in Sunnyvale, CA I was sitting in my backyard around 2:30 or 3:00pm today when I heard a very loud sound of a jet(s) approaching.  I looked up and saw two fighter planes flying very close together in a 10:00 direction behind me, they had already flown overhead before I heard them I guess.   Then at about 12:00 direction something caught my eye, it was a silver, reflective orb or possibly egg shaped object that seemed to be undulating colors, possibly blue or purple. Then a large passenger jet entered my vision at approx. 7:00 direction. Although I had 3 other standard aircraft in view it was very difficult to determine size or distance of the fourth out-of-place flying object. It seemed to be flying at about the same altitude as the jets or perhaps a bit lower. The object moved so strangely (sort of curving or arced movements) that I ran inside to grab the digital camera. Of course the damn battery was recharging in the wall socket. Grabbed it anyway, loaded into camera, ran outside (it turned on), but when I aimed at object it was already getting too far away to see anything. I could still see with my eyes but couldn't train viewfinder on it, very frustrating. Camera only has 3x zoom. Lost sight of object after fiddling with camera further. Very interesting thing to see but disappointed I could not document - so all that remains is yet another anecdote. :(;37.3740612565446;-122.02055183246
