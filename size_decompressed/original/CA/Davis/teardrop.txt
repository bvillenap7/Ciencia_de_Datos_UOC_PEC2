10 orbs in scattered formation with fast moving satellite overhead;2012-08-18 00:05:00;1 minute;10 orbs in scattered formation with fast moving satellite overhead While driving on us 50 east, in or around Davis, CA, at 12:05 am on 8/18/2012,  I saw about 10 orb or tear shaped objects.  They were not in any precise formation, but appeared to be all along the same plane.  They were off the 50 west side of the freeway, varying from 200 to 500 feet off the ground. They were extremely bright (yellowish light).  They were completely stationary, not bobbing in the wind, and appeared motionless.  I slowed to about 35 MPH in the fast lane, and several other vehicles were slowed to the same speed or less, and I assume they were looking at the same thing.   A light passing fast overhead caught my eye as I was looking at the orbs. It was like a satellite or falling falling star.  The falling star was no where near the orbs, and appeared to be in space, but it added to the excitement of what I was seeing.  The orbs were so bright I could not make out any kind of structural properties (like being a solid craft or not).   I am 42, and this is ! my first ever UFO sighting.;38.5517646551724;-121.734187068966
