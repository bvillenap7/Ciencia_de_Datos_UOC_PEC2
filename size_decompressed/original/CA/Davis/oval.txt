Oval shaped metallic object with two lights that appeared to move back and forth between the ends.;2021-08-14 18:00:00;5 minutes;Oval shaped metallic object with two lights that appeared to move back and forth between the ends. My racing pigeons were flying around the property and while watching them I noticed a bright object in the sky coming from the south. I assumed that when it got closer it would turn out to be an areophane, but something compelled me to keep watching it. When it did get closer I saw that it did not have wings and was somewhere between oval and Tic Tac in shape. It had a metallic appearance and had bright lights at either end (this could have alternatively been reflection from the sun to the west). As it got closer it gradually changed directions and began heading east. It did not change orientation as it changed its direction of travel by 90 degrees. As it moved away the lights appeared to switch back and forth between the two ends. I continued watching it as it got further away, but I looked away briefly as the property ownerâ€™s dog had seen me and began barking. When I looked back to the object it was then dark with no bright areas and after looking away bri! efly again I could no longer find it. I estimate the time of day to have been between 18:00-19:30 and the duration of the sighting to be approximately 5 minutes.;38.5517646551724;-121.734187068966
