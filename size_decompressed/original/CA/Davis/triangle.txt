Speedy Black Triangle over Central California in the middle of the day.;1989-11-24 13:30:00;15-20 seconds;Speedy Black Triangle over Central California in the middle of the day. I was traveling west on I-80 near Davis with my mother mid-day.  We both saw a black triangular shaped aircraft to the south of us by several miles.  I think we had a side view of it because it absolutely had a front end that came to a definitive point and more mass toward the rear where it was thicker.  It was hard to gauge it's size at that distance. The object began its path below where we could see because of a berm built up on the side of the highway so we couldn't tell if it started on the ground or not.  It shot up in a perfectly straight line at about a 45 degree angle from behind the berm.  It moved at incredible speed until it got up a couple thousand feet and then just stopped dead in place below some low level clouds.  It rotated in place so the front end was pointing straight up, and then shot up through the clouds at the same incredible velocity. I'm very knowledgeable about military aircraft, and this was not only moving with linear speed (unlike aircraft with throttle) that far exceed conventional aircraft, it stopped in place so abruptly that any pilot would have been killed.

Black craft in triangle shape in a big field between residential neighborhood and country. Approx 15-20 yards wide, about 150-200 ft up;2011-01-14 22:00:00;2 minutes;Black craft in triangle shape in a big field between residential neighborhood and country. Approx 15-20 yards wide, about 150-200 ft up, and about 200 yards away from our car as we were passing  White lights around edges of craft, one light blinking.  Traveling about 15-20 MPH.  I rolled down the window and could    not hear sound from craft over passing wind.  We did not stop because I was too embarrassed to suggest it.;38.5517646551724;-121.734187068966
3 white lights and 1 red seen over field in Davis;2012-06-16 22:24:00;5 minutes;3 white lights and 1 red seen over field in Davis As I was driving down Pole Line past Harper Jr High, I looked out to my left and saw 3 bright white lights in a triangle form.  I thought it was a plane but it didn't have the blinking hazard lights on the ends. It had 3 white lights in a triangle formation and under the frontmost light there seemed to be a red light. It moved farther away from me over the course of a few minutes.  The movement was very smooth. As it moved away it seems like it turned almost on its side and went higher up.   Now I'm not sure if it was one triangular craft or 3 moving independently of each other. I sadly had to stop watching and drive.;38.5517646551724;-121.734187068966
Red triangular Lights, With Multicolored Lights Randomly Between them (31sec. Video);2012-10-02 01:43:00;12:31 seconds;Red Triangular Lights, With Multicolored Lights Randomly Between them (31sec. Video) My dog was kind of acting up, and she had done so a few nights before.  She seemed anxious, and seemed to want me to take her out. She had done this a few nights before, and I had taken her out.  When I went outside I remember hearing a loud sound, of what seemed like horns, or trumpets from all around.  I remember it being very early in the morning, maybe two am, and thinking, why isn't anyone else waking to this sound. I thought about it later, and thought maybe my dog had heard the sound, and that is why she wanted to go out. So On October 2nd, when my dog did this again I was much quicker to go outside. Again I heard the horn/trumpet sound, though this time it seemed a bit muted, almost like I was hearing it in a vacuum, similar to hearing the ocean in a seashell.  I looked over the horizon and saw nothing, then from overhead noticed what appeared to be a triangle of lights, with what appeared to be randomly moving lights running between each of the triangle points.  It was very large, and all I could really see were the lights, and definitive darker, more shadowed area within the confines of the lights on the corners.  It continued to move away from me in a Southern direction, and reached a point on the horizon where is seemed to remain still, or in a relatively central location for a few minutes.  I was able to get 31 seconds of video with my cell phone, and then the battery died.  The video was shot prior to it reaching the location on the horizon where it hovered,and I opted to stay and watch it, as opposed to trying to go in and get a quick charge on my phone to record more video (Which is what I did after watching it hover for a few minutes on the horizon, when I returned to try to record more, it was gone.) I have seen a lot of unusual air traffic, late night, early morning in this area.  I am very close to a small airport, but the planes that fly in, both day and night are distinctly different than what I heard or saw on the 2nd. and on the previous night.  I will keep looking, and hopefully get more video, should it occur again.;38.5517646551724;-121.734187068966
