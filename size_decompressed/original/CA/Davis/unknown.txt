The light formation was not round. The formation looked like a small arc cut out of a section of a rainbow like a rectangular curve. It came over my house and headed northwest towards the fields between Woodland and Davis a few minutes before 10:00 at night.  It was extremely fast. I immediately took a walk around the block to search the skys, but did not see anything else but stars. Observer is a Special Education Teacher.;38.5517646551724;-121.734187068966
