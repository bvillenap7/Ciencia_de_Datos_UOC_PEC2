3 bright orange balls over Davis Ca;2012-05-30 22:35:00;5 minutes;3 bright orange balls over Davis Ca As I was driving in East Davis at approximately 22:35, I noticed 3 fairly close orange balls in the sky hovering and not moving.  At first I thought someone had launched some sort of lanterns or lights, but the objects began moving apart and then quickly started moving East towards Sacramento (fairly fast).  I pulled over so I could have a closer look.  The objects were fairly low just above the treeline and the ojects had a very bright orange color.  They were clearly not an aircraft as their movement away from eachother was non linear.  There were no sounds present.  I have never seen anything similar in this town before.
