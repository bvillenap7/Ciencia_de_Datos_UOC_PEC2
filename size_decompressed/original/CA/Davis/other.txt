We were driving on I-80, going south,when we saw  a very bright large sphere of  light hovering just over hills. We thought it was a plane getting ready to land.  But then it suddenly dove straight down.  It had a comet like tail. It then hovered again.  Then it started flying slowly in a Serpentine fashion in our direction.  It was exremely bright.  It then hovered again in one spot not moving.  Then all of a sudden it dove to the right at a very high rate of speed behind some trees in the very near west of us.;38.5517646551724;-121.734187068966
