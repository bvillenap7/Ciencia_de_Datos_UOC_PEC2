light  with tail doing serpentine manuever over I-80 in Davis;2008-10-25 19:30:00;5 minutes?;light  with tail doing serpentine manuever over I-80 in Davis I first observed what I thought was a plane waiting to land. We were traveling south on I-80 in Davis. The object was traveling north. It was at first about 11:oo in our direction but moved over to the 1:00 position. It seemed to hover at a stand still without moving for a couple of minutes. I am sure other people had to see this as there were many people on the freeway. What shocked us into believing that this was a ufo, was the fact that suddenly from a hovering and still position it seemed to dive rapidly staight down,just dropping,maybe a thousand feet,that is when we saw a strobe like tail behind it. Then it stopped and hovered not moving once again. Then it began to fly in a sepentine fashion towards us, zig-zagging back in forth at a slower speed, very rythmically like a snake as if it were putting on a show. At this point it was much closer and very bright white light!.The lighted strobe like tail was very evident as it was doing it s shaped manuever. Then It suddenly picked up speed again, rose a little higher and then dove quickley.It was headed at a slant toward the trees that were at the 3:00 position from us and it disappeared. It was very dramatic ,and very close. I would describe it as a stingray shape and the whole object was lit up. It was illuminating bright white light. The compass, milaege and temperature navigator in our jeep went a little goofy for a while.;38.5517646551724;-121.734187068966
