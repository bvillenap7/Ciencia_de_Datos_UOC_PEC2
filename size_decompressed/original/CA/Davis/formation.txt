Y or V  shaped light formation seen moving from South to North over Davis, California.;2005-12-02 20:55:00;20-45 secs;Y or V  shaped light formation seen moving from South to North over Davis, California. My first thought was it looked like illuminated geese flying in a modified (possibly a tail first Y or V with something extra)formation.  The lights were oval and held their position so they may have been lights on a structure but the structure itself was not visible, only the lights.  They were not bright and were visible only while almost overhead.  There was no sound associated with the movement and the movement was smooth.  I started to count the lights when it was about 2/3 past me and counted 9 but the clarity was diminishing and there seemed to be more than that.  It was moving from South to North.;38.5517646551724;-121.734187068966
