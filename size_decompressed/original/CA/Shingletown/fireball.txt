Fireball with a tail heading in a downward motion;2018-09-23 19:00:00;7 minutes;Fireball with a tail heading in a downward motion September 23, 2018 Sighting of object approximate 7:00 p.m. I noticed what I first thought was a speck of a cloud (as others were to the left of it) straight out my living room window which faces directly West. It was very well lit, as the other clouds also were, and held my attention. I then started to notice it was moving downward instead of off to the left like the other clouds were doing. I went and got a pair of binoculars and when I looked at it, I could see it had a “tail” and appeared to be a comet! I got my camera and began taking pictures of it, calling my husband,to come and look at it. In all I have 9 photos.  The first is take normally.  I then started zooming in hoping that the image would be easier to see or identify.  From the time I first saw it, approximately 7-10 minutes had passed. I have since looked on-line for any reports of an object in the sky, or astronomical sites reporting comets, or any other such thing.  I have been unable to find any other mention of this object. I will be emailing the photos along with a map of Calif showing approximate where I was, and where I saw the object move in a downward path until it went behind the mountain. My husband and I are both retired.  We have lived and worked in the Redding area for the past 30 years, give or take.  This is the first time I have ever seen something unusual in the sky and the fact that I was unable to find any reports of it yet has peaked my interest!!;40.505;-121.8857
