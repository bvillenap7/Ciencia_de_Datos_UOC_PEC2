Red blue white..green...I think...flashed Back .....we flashed a flashlight....hovered and flashed back...lights seemed to circle...it stayed in one place and we saw the light flash...over a three hour period.   We became afraid when it didn't leave.  My family had seen bright quick lights move over mt lasses darting about usually in three to five units frequently over many years.  We lived on thirty acres in the middle of a remote area.  My husband couldn't believe but finally saw this.  My daughter saw it.  On the special event night which I report a hover craft with the miscellaneous lights was opposite lassen on the other side where we owned twenty acres in addition to our thirty...so we had fifty...the twenty was surrounded by BLM pro...across Wilson hill road.    Our thirty faced mt lassen ....17 miles west.  We Sat on the ledge.....commonly called piss call flat in the old days.  This property is still there.  1.2 miles down Wilson hill road from hwy 44 in shingle town California.  I am sure the new owners must have seen this.  It was frequent.  All members of my family are still alive.  The address was and is ((address deleted)) road.  Shingle town California.;40.505;-121.8857
