In complete unison, this object traversed the sky while we were camping. The lights kind of changed from bright star looking lights to amberish reddish lights off and on.  It lost reflection or something, here and there?  That is what it looked like.  There was no noise.  It was far up in the atmosphere.;40.505;-121.8857
