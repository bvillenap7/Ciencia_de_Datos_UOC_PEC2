Super fast streak of light;2001-07-22 23:30:00;1/5 second;Super fast streak of light In light of the Monday's fireball, I thought I'd relay this from Sunday night. I was laying in bed at about 11:30pm, looking out the sliding glass door at the stars as I always do before going to sleep. I was about 6 feet from the door which is about 6 feet across. Then suddenly a pinpoint white light streaked across the span of the door so fast that it shocked me. It must have taken in my guess a fifth of a second or less to cross. I live way out in the country and frequently see falling stars, but I have never seen one travel this fast. I don't guess that anyone else could have seen it, but I thought I'd pass it along just the same.;37.7961999999999;-121.000800000001
6/25/13 about midnight.;2013-06-26 00:00:00;20 minutes;6/25/13 about midnight. Looking out my window toward the south, I saw what appeared to be two stars side by side.  These were much larger and closer in the sky than any stars appearing at the time.  One “star” slowly moved to the east, the other stayed in place but I could see it was not perfectly still, seemed to have a little motion.   Observed 15-20 minutes and fell asleep, woke up no longer saw this “star”.  No real color to it other than the appearance of a star twinkling. I have lived here 25 years looking out this window almost nightly and never observed anything like this before. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above, to reflect a sighting after midnight.  PD));37.7961999999999;-121.000800000001
