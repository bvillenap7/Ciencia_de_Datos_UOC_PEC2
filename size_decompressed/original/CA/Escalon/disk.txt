Saucer-shaped object tilting to the left with white glowing ring around it in 1st pic, 2nd pic (seconds after) craft was gone.;2014-10-31 15:00:00;<2 seconds;Sourer shaped object tilting to the left with white glowing ring around it in 1st pic, 2nd pic (seconds after) craft was gone. I was taking some pictures for an estimate on an industrial coatings job.  I was in a hurry to make another appointment, took my last few pictures and left.  The next day i showed the work pictures to my nephew and suddenly he looks at me with an excited expression and said, You look a picture of a UFO!!!  I focused the picture to the back ground and i saw saucer shaped object tilting to the left with a white glowing ring around the whole saucer shaped object.  I had taken two pictures, seconds a part from the right to the left to get the full scope of work.  The picture quality is pretty is pretty descent with my smart phones zooming abilities. So, that was the first picture. I took two.  Picture # 2 has almost the same background. Picture # 2 was taken 2 seconds or so after of the first picture, moving slightly from the right to the left.  Anyway, the saucer shaped object does not appear in the 2nd picture.  This picture is in the back ground and theres a lot of landscape in the view so where did it go?  Our fastest jets would still be in the background and i would have herd it!! Im going to copywriter the two pics and then ill share them.;37.7961999999999;-121.000800000001
