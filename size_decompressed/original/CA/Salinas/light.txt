They were very small and very faint, but distinctly visible.  They were moving relative to each other, almost floating up and down.  Both parties saw both objects.;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846

At first looked like a shooting star but was slower and then changed direction.  Appeared in yard (about 3 acre lot) just IN FRONT of the tree line then dropped into the valley and she lost sight of it.  He impression was that it landed on the neighbor's lot. The dog barked, growled and repeatedly ran from the fence bordering neighbor's and then cried to come in. It is an outdoor dog. She called me in Hawaii at about 1 a.m. our time. Best to ask her.;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846

My boyfriend was driving me back home 30 minutes after midnight when we seen a UFO.   It was in the north part of town by the fields and the mountains it appeared to be hovering over houses.  It was a bright green color that did not blink at all.    When we spotted the UFO it was hovering, then it moved side ways back and forth and rapidly flew towards the east.  It was flying in a downward direction instead of upward as if heading towards the ground.   My boyfriend and I circled the neighborhood for over 30 minutes but did not find too many unusual things.  We also passed by the airport and noticed that there was no airplane activity but the light tower was on.;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846

This is not a plane for it will stop in mid air and then resume to move very quickly in ways no plane can move from this time and age. I have witnessed this object for over a week in the Sky during full moon and it always appears in the sane area.  It moves so quickly at times I can't believe what I'm seeing. I would like someone too contact me and see this and possibly take video too prove what I have been witnessing...;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846
Extremely fast horizontal trajectory white light;2014-10-15 20:00:00;~20 seconds;Extremely fast horizontal trajectory white light At approximately 8pm on the night of Wednesday, October 15, 2014, my wife and I noticed the fastest flying object either of us have ever seen in the sky above Salinas, Ca.  We were on N. Main Street in our car facing South in moderate traffic when we noticed a bright constant white light in the sky above the valley traveling right to left, or West to South East, at an extremely fast speed that instantly grabbed our attention.  It had no blinking lights as would normally be present on an aircraft and it was traveling so far that we immediately concluded that it wasn't a plane or jet.  It maintained a horizontal trajectory, never falling the way a shooting star would.  We watched it for approximately 20 seconds before we lost view of it in the distance, still glowing bright white as it traveled down the valley towards Soledad.  There were clouds in the sky, and while we saw common airplanes in the sky immediately after, moving slowly in comparison and receding occasionally behind a cloud, we both noted that the UFO never receded behind any clouds during our brief observation.  This indicates that it flew below the cloud line low enough in the Salinas Valley to rule out a satellite or missile.  We have an annual air show here and we both grew up watching jets race over the valley one weekend out of every year.  We both agree what we saw was by far much much faster than any jet we've ever witnessed.;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846

I was driving home from work around 5am, when I suddenly seen a straight three bright, white light craft flying really close to ground, it caught my attention by the way it would move around ... it shifted different directions at a high speed.  I proceded home (shocked).  Once I got home, I got out of my car and a loude motor noise above in the sky came closer..  The craft that I first seen passed above me, the motor noice was ridiculous loud it left birds chirping.

Video of UFO over Cali during wildfires 2017;2017-10-14 15:46:00;2-4 minutes;Video of UFO over Cali during wildfires 2017 On 3:40 pm in California, I went outside to my balcony because I had a headache all day and I wanted to lay down on the couch outside.  As I sat facing northern Cali, I saw a falcon close by and behind it what appeared to be flock of ducks or gooses I thought to my self that are fleeing the fire in the north.  As they came closer they started dispersing into groups of one two and threes, and they looked more like lights hovering rather than flying and moving smoothly in a harmonious balanced motion.  I called on my daughter to get me my phone and to validate my sightings, she was not able to spit them, meanwhile my camera did. I have a video of 1:20sec long. After they crossed my apartment, I stopped the video and rushed outside to maybe take more videos, and see where they are going, but they went out of sight and towards the sun direction. I went back home and checked the video, they were clearly shown after I zoomed it while taking the pictures;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846

Saw a green light flash in the sky and looked like it was coming down out of the sky and then just vanished out.  We were not around any civilization, just fields.  The two cars in front of us pulled over and i saw the drivers peering up into the sky as well.  It was crazy and i couldn't believe my eyes but seeing the other cars look up and my boyfriend saw it too so it was definitely something!!!! ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Hi there! I thought it could have been a meteor as well but it was far too big and far too green!! It was like a green orb but the inside was bright!  It was just crazy how to two cars in front of us immediately pulled over as well and i saw the drivers and passengers looking into the sky so I felt like they saw something as well and it wasn’t an ordinary meteor, but I’m open for speculation!  Hahaha it was just SUPER COOL!  I feel like I’ve waiting my whole life to see something like that!! ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((ADDENDUM #2)) It was around 2:00 AM on Sunday the 8th!

Entity encounter, while sleeping.;2019-04-05 01:00:00;20 seconds;ENTITY ENCOUNTER   In the early morning of Friday, April 5, 2019, appx. 1:00 am, I awakened to something in my bedroom with my husband, sound asleep, and my 2 dogs, asleep in the bathroom.  This orb of bright white light, had eyes, a slit that represented a mouth, was approx. 18 inches from my face.  It “illuminated” my face, as it seemed to assess me while I was trying to assess it. I remember thinking, did someone break into our house and is in the bedroom?  The door was closed and this orb did not have a body, nor did I see any hair . It appeared to have somewhat of a face the eyes were staring through me, and was not a friendly gaze. I remember being frightened however, could not break my gaze. Then it disappeared. The encounter was a matter of seconds, approxx. 10-20 seconds. This past week, I have been trying to understand what I saw and recount the details.  It has been haunting.  For a few  nights, I was afraid to go to sleep.  At first, I thought it could be a visit from a spirit(?) however, it wasn’t a familiar sight. It wasn’t until I heard on the news, there were strange parallel lines in the sky above Los Angeles, the next day, April 6, that I believed it could have been an entity encounter. To clarify my personality,  I am a 63 year young woman , married for 34 years , no children , just my beautiful dogs.  I am of sound mind, very grounded always level headed. I do not participate in any groups or clubs  We live on a hill top in Salinas surrounded by 8 acres, I cannot disclose our address due to my husband’s company, which deals in secure information from ((subject deleted)). I am a ((deleted for the past ((three decades)) years in Carmel, CA. I wanted to share this experience with you as it still haunts me and remains prominent on my mind.
