Fireball flickers to a huge tumbling black potato, eyes and all, looking rock;1998-06-06 19:00:00;10 seconds;Fireball flickers to a huge tumbling black potato, eyes and all, looking rock About ten to fifteen years ago, I was talking to my elderly mother on the phone next door while I was looking out of a large skylight.  Living in a small canyon about five miles from and just out of sight of the Pacific coast, it wasn’t uncommon to see small planes flying over about five hundred feet up.  They were visible for about ten to fifteen seconds.  But without a sound this time, a flaming crop-duster appeared from over the ridge tumbling end over end about a second a turn toward the setting sun.  I called to my mother, Look out of you front sliding glass door, Mamma!   She was too old & slow to see it while I described to her.  Before the object disappeared over the hill I saw the flames flicker out, but with the setting sun shining on it, very visibly was a huge coal black potato shaped, eyes and all, rock still tumbling at the same rate until it faded out of sight. I should’ve turned it in then, but better late than never.  Now I figure it came into our atmosphere keeping its course enough to flame until it passed on through.  Why wasn’t it on the News and how far up was it, and how big? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846
One brightly lit ball that left a trail.;2000-07-01 22:30:00;15 seconds;One brightly lit ball that left a trail. The craft appeared to be moving from southwest to Northeast. At a medium altitude, aprox. 2 or 3 miles up. We had intermitant fog cover to look through when observing this object. It had an exhaust and was brightly lit. The front was rounded and moved at a constant speed. It did not appear to be losing altitude but it did look like it was burning up. We observe this object to be a white and brightly lit with no blinking lights of a normal plane. It had an exhaust tail that was quite uniform in two sections out the back. It made no sound like any other plane going the speed of sound.;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846
