Huge pulsing object shoots across sky toward ocean.;2013-08-12 21:08:00;3 seconds;Huge pulsing object shoots across sky toward ocean. We were on hwy 101 south bound maybe an hour past salinas. I was looking at the stars in front of us when what at first appeared to be a shooting caught my attention passing over the car. I assumed this for split second because of how fast the object was moving. This is what got my attention... The path of the object wasn't arching or sloping like shooting star. It went in a straight line overhead at a very high altitude. It was shaped like a AA battery with a pulsing orange/red/yellow light in the middle. When it light up from the pulsing light we could see this thing was huge!!!  I live 10-15 from a airport and have 737's fly overhead all day and night. Even with the planes at low altitude, this object was still at least twice as big at high altitude. And moving as fast as a shooting star.;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846
