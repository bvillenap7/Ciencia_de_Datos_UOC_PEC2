UFO fly's over houses and lands a couple blocks away in a school baseball field.;1978-06-30 17:00:00;5 minutes;UFO fly's over houses and lands a couple blocks away in a school baseball field. I was outside playing with my dog and it flew over my street Toro Blvd. towards the school down the road. I ran in told my mom and we walked together down to the school, the whole time my dog was going nuts I remember I could barely hold him, when we got there it was gone but it left a burnt smell and apparently where it landed it left a ring around the school field where it landed. I remember it clearly. The ring was incredibly big meaning the craft was big..guessing at the size now 40 years later I'd say it was 100 ft in diameter, was a perfect circle and was still warm to the touch. When it flew over it had blue to greenish lights underneath it and thinking about it now because I was young it could have been it's propulsion emiting the colors. It was only above the roofs of the houses by about 20 feet if that. It was close enough you could hear it. For lack of a better word it sounded Sonic, metallic whistle? Hard to explain and more people than me had se! en it that day. I remember people standing in the street looking the direction of the school. There was actually a Salinas newspaper clipping that my mom saved for years talking about the UFO sighting. Many people seen it that day but I don't see any mention of it anywhere now. Must of been real otherwise we would see media on the sighting. It can be hidden from the people but I know what I seen and will never forget it.;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846
Disc shaped saucer craft seen about 100 feet away;1979-04-01 17:00:00;1 minute;Disc shaped saucer craft seen about 100 feet away I cannot recall the exact month or day but the year was 1979.  I have never made public this information, this is the first time.  I was only 6 years old when I saw this object.  It must have been a weekend at about 5:30 p.m. and I had with two of my older brothers from some activities.  I headed up the third story floor of where we we're staying at the Travelers Motel in Salinas, CA.  I headed out the balcony just to catch some air and I happened to look up.  As I looked up, about no more than 100 feet from me I saw a hovering disc craft that must of been about 30 feet in diameter.  It had some lights at the bottom.  Here is the interesting part: it said something about FORD the car dealership sort of like a blimp  I had just passed by the FORD Dealership about 30 minutes and they were having a sale.  Anyways it was producing a humming sound sort of like a refrigerator.  This object was heading due west and it was traveling at about 20 miles an hour.  The saucer was metallic greyish and i got to observe it for about 1 minute till it dissapeared out in the distance but never the less had maintained its constant speed and direction of travel.  I have not investigated this matter any further but I thinking that I will be checkin the local library regarding any newspaper excepts on microfilm for any reports during that particular year.

As clear as life, as like I had never seen a real saucer craft .;1981-08-10 19:00:00;10 min;As clear as life, as like I had never seen a real saucer craft . I had been repairing an opal engine for my son and we cam to find out we needed a special wrench. It was sort of late so we decided to try the Monte Mart Store which had a auto parts department. I asked my wife for her keys and we left on her wagon going west. As we approached the turn to the intesection, we saw some strange lites that were going thru some midsize camphor trees, we thought it was some carnival at the school. As soon as we made the turn on the intersection,my son's eyes were as big as large olives and he dad we have finally seen one, I knew what he meant. I decided to park right below it and e could see it was aluminum like and it had a row of windows on the bottmo half and a complete circle of windows on top w/a blue light always rotating. I told my son to check the bottom and I would check the top. The bottom windows wre like frosted and we could nt see anything inside. It was there hovering about 10 to 15 degress front down. It was just as clear as observing a a plane at the airport. When all this happened the object changed to a rotating platform with rotating yellow letter signs about 7 foot long. It was garbeled at first but it started going around with Enlish letters telling us to tell the world, we decided not to tell anyone as we might look and sound like fools. My son, my wife my two girls and I, talked about it for years. And the lights were coherent lighting of different oolors not just any lghts. The bottom was covered with antennae like sticks and also a lot of lights. I said ten minutes but my wife and another 20 min at the store, my had always said it took us longer to get back and its only about 1 mile.;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846
