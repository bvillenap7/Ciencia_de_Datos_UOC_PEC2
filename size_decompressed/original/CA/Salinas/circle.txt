A light described as huge, enormous, large, was falling from the sky at great speed and disappeared just before it hit the horizon.  It is unknown as to how far away the object was or how large it really was.  One person said they never saw anything so big in the sky, light the moon.  Bright light object with no trailing tail. White in color on the top and Yellowish in color along the bottom.;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846
Round white object near Salinas freeway;2004-11-17 09:20:00;1 minute;Round white object near Salinas freeway As we were driving south on Hwy.101, we spotted a round, white object in the sky over some one story commercial buildings alongside the freeway at the Boronda Rd. exit off to our right. It quickly seemed to move off horizontally in a westerly direction, as we drove southbound away from it. It looked like it may have been about 500 - 1000 ft. high and about a mile or so distant from our position. It's possible it could have been a helium balloon, but it looked round and seemed to travel quite quickly, despite the apparent lack of wind. I lost sight of it as we continued driving further away. I looked at my watch and noted the time and also the location of where we were at so that I could report it.;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846
