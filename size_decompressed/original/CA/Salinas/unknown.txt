Possible closely encounter?;1978-06-01 09:00:00;90 minutes;Possible closely encounter? I was only 7 years old when I had a strange experience.  This is what I remember I was playing little league softball and a home fun was hit.  I jumped on my bike and rid into a wooded area that I saw the ball fly into.  Got off my bike went looking for the ball in the woods.  After entering the woods I remember a bright light shining through the trees and an awfull smell like burnt rubber or sulfur.  After that I remember I was laying on the ground looking st the sky with my hands across my chest and the soft ball in my hands.  I don’t remember finding the soft ball  so don’t have any idea how I ended up with it Gus’s I passed out from the smell and then someone or something put the ball in my hands.;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846

Slow-moving craft with rectangular light that changed colors as it swept through an arc;2016-02-03 18:25:00;5 minutes;Slow-moving craft with rectangular light that changed colors as it swept through an arc I was out walking my dog after dinner, when I saw a very slow-flying craft just to the north of our location.  I would estimate that it was less than a quarter-mile away, but could not make out the shape of it due to the glare of street lights in the area. The craft had two small red and blue flashing lights on the bottom and was moving so slowly that it seemed to just be hanging in the air. It made a sort of whirling sound as it moved by toward the east.  When it passed us I could see a small, steady red light on the right rear of the craft and a small, steady amber light on the left rear. After a few minutes of it traveling slowly east/northeast it turned enough that I could see what appeared to be a very large rectangular panel of light on the left side of the craft that rotated side-to-side in an arc.  The light was very bright white when it swept from the back to the front, and very bright green when it swept from the front toward the back. By the time I thought to get my cellphone out to try to get a photo, it had moved out of range.;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846
