I like to star gaze at night with my binoculars,whenever its very dark and clear. On this night I was observing a star cluster and the occaaional aircraft that would fly overhead. I was observing a small aircraft, I know that it was a small plane be-cause I could hear the plane's engine running, at night you really can't make out any details out on the plane like wings or tail all you can really make out are the lights. Well anyway I was watching this plane when I noticed what I thought was another aircraft flying behind and just slightly above the first plane that I was watchig, I noticed that the second aircrafts lights were all the same color and that they were very dim for being an aircraft, I also noted that I could make out details about the shape of the craft, it was oval! There were no wings and no tail I realy do not understand how I could make out so much detail if the lights were so dim. I do not go around making ufo reports. The only other ufo I have ever seen was in the early sixties when I was a youg boy. My brother and I were walking to the corner neihborhood store when a huge green ball of fire flew right over our heads all I realy want to know if anybody out ther has had a similar expierence to mine and I want to know are these things real?;36.6933578947368;-121.645346153846
