Fireball in the sky over Carlsbad State Beach, California.;2014-01-19 19:17:00;5 minutes;Fireball in the sky over Carlsbad State Beach, California. We observed a fireball in the sky to the West at the South State Carlsbad Beach on the corner of Poinsettia and Hwy 101 (Carlsbad Blvd) in Carlsbad, CA.   It hovered in the sky and zoomed towards us as we photographed and made a video of it.  It eventually moved several times and then zoomed out of sight in an instant.  We have pictures and videos of the fireball.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Fuzzy star grows larger and fainter until finally vanishing.;2015-03-12 21:15:00;2 minutes;Fuzzy star grows larger and fainter until finally vanishing. I was working the gate at a fairly high Security facility and looked up at the bright stars that night.  Saw one star straight up, at the bright end of the scale that appeared fuzzy.  As I watched it, I saw that it was getting bigger, like it was coming toward me, but getting fainter at the same time.   I alerted the other guard who came over and saw the object, which now appeared as a fading grey circular object that continued to grow in size.  I looked at the object through a handheld thermal imaging camera but could not see it (Likely due to high altitude).  We watched the object until it was probably the size of a dime at armâ€™s length.  By this time, it had moved slightly horizontally (As if drifting), but was still perfectly round.   I alerted our Supervisor, who was now wondering what we were looking at, but the object had become too dim for him to see.  The sighting lasted 2 minutes.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002

Appeared orange molten metal streaking high speed leaving trail of molten material. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:45:00;1 minute;First appeared orange molten metal streaking high speed leaving trail of molten material.  As craft slowed to almost hover molten material was dripping of the bottom of cicular craft.  Visibility was clear not a cloud in the sky until a greenish blue beam ectended from rear of craft pointed in front og craft causing vector change of direction and altitude.  The molten orange faded away. And a whites light coned out from where the green blue ray was emited and suddenly a vapoe appeated formed a cloud and the ship disappeared leaveing a contrail of greenish blue trail behind for 2 or 3 seconds.  I got photo on my phone but lackes detail. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
