V shaped formation of approximately 7 lights obseved for 2 seconds. Formation approx 2 1/2 fingers wide, seen for 30 deg. of arc. No so;1999-11-18 02:18:00;2 seconds;V shaped formation of approximately 7 lights obseved for 2 seconds. Formation approx 2 1/2 fingers wide, seen for 30 deg. of arc. No sound. While watching for meteorites, observed V shaped formation of about seven lights at 2:18 am going SSE toward San Diego, CA at 30 deg from azimuth to 60 deg from azimuth going straight away. Formation was dim and would not have been seen without having been looking at the general location. The V shaped formation was like a migrating geese formation or the leading edge of a YF117. However the formation was about 2 1/2 fingers wide, which would have been close for an airplane, but there was no sound. The formation would have passed overhead, but it wasn't observed until 30 deg from azimuth. Also, it would be unlikely to observe leading edge lights while going away. Time of observation was 1 to 2 seconds. Enclosed angle of formation, about 70 deg. I could not tell if starlight was blocked out within the formation. I'm a conservative aerospace structures engineer, 60+ years old, first UFO sighting.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Wobbling silver craft seen in Carlsbad, CA with bright light in broad daylight.;2003-03-26 14:00:00;30 seconds;Wobbling silver craft seen in Carlsbad, CA with bright light in broad daylight. I was driving one mile east of Interstate 5 on Palomar Airport Rd. when I looked to my front left and saw a triangular craft wobling and flying slowly (about 40mph) south about three hundred feet above the landscape. The craft looked like it was totally stainless steel, had no visible windows and when tilted I could see the whole tail edge was lit with a very bright light (like the lights of a night baseball game} there were no clouds in the sky and the craft just disappeared in one second though it was no more than a half mile away.  There was no sound from the craft. *note about five years ago while driving at night in Carlsbad my wife and I saw a bright comet like fireball emitting splashes of bright light to its rear travelling about 50 mph in a southeasterly direction towards Rancho Sante Fe going cross country following the contours of the land.  There was no road that it followed.  This was about four miles from the above sighting. I reported this via email at the time.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Dimly lit triangular shaped object moves slowly high above Carlsbad State Beach Sat. evening 12/29/07;2007-12-29 19:00:00;a few minutes;Dimly lit triangular shaped object moves slowly high above Carlsbad State Beach Sat. evening 12/29/07 Four adults and 2 children witnessed a strangely lit, triangular shaped object quietly traverse the night sky above Carlsbad State Beach. It was a cold clear evening. The stars were bright and the visibility was excellent.  It was large, triangular shaped, very dimly lit (unlike the stars that were sharp and bright) and quiet. It moved just east of the shoreline from north to south. The object then turned approximately 45 degrees toward the east. It traveled a short distance then disappeared. We did not see it move away rapidly, rather it just vanished or we lost sight of it. The duration was 3 to 5 minutes.  We saw a light that could have been a small aircraft behind it. It seemed to follow it for a distance. Both of these objects appeared to be fairly low in the sky, like the altitude of large aircraft.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Un-lit, fast moving, low altitude triangular craft seen visually and with thermal imaging camera.;2019-10-31 21:36:00;10 seconds;Un-lit, fast moving, low altitude triangular craft seen visually and with thermal imaging camera. I am a security guard, at a fairly high security location. While looking toward the sky for an owl we heard screeching, I saw a dark triangle shaped craft pass over at high speed and at low altitude. Object was very hard to see, with 3 extremely dim large lights, or possibly it was just illuminated by ground lights in the three circular areas beneath it.  The object was only visible to the naked eye for seconds. I switched to a hand held thermal night vision camera and could see the object had heat and some thickness to it. The object appeared about as big as a small plane at several hundred feet. The object was moving faster than other aircraft and made no sound. It vanished from view with the camera in less than 10 seconds.  Object was heading South/Southeast, roughly toward an airport only a mile or two away. Since the tower is open until 10 PM, I would think they would have seen it on radar, unless it was stealthy or slightly too low.  I yelled to a colleague to step over and look up, but it had vanished visually before he could see it. Within 10 minutes of the sighting, a large military helicopter did a low flyover of the airport and flew through the area where the craft was last sighted. This happens occasionally, so it is unknown if related.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
