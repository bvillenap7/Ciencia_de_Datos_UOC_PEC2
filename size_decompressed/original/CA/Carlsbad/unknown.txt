I noticed the object outside my kitchen window at 1:00 a.m. when I went in to get a drink of water. The object was very bright and just above treetop level several miles in the distance.  The object itself was not moving, however, after examining it with opera glasses, I could see that it was hovering and the middle appeared to be rotating with colors of red and blue.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002

I have in the last month purchased two pairs of powerful binoculars, thinking of even getting more powerful one.  Also have a Canon 80d which has a telescopic type lens, which most of the pics are from.  The pics from Nov 13th when reviewing my pics, I have still not looked at the rest of November, as I was amazed at what I already caught.  I have seen the same craft I have pictured on Nov 13th I saw during the day and captured a pic of just before it vanished.  I could not see the craft with my eyes, only with my binoculars but took the picture in the same direction as I viewed it and caught it. I have so many of these pictures if you want more.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
