Bright light off the SW coast of California;2008-02-12 07:45:00;20 seconds;Bright light off the SW coast of California I was driving South on Coast Highway around 7:45am, when I noticed a bright light hovering above the Ocean. I immediatly thought this was too bright to be a plane or helicopter. The body of this object looked like an aluminum soda with a bright light illuminating from the bottom of the can (lying side down). I shifted my eyes to make sure I was staying on the road, and when I looked back at the same location, it had disapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
