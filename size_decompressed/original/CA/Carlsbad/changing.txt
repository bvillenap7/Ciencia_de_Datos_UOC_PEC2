I noticed one very outstanding whitish looking object,;2018-01-13 14:30:00;2 hours;Saturday, January 13, 2018, I was testing out my new binoculars 15 x 70 Giant Astronomy type and I was using Vivitar Red # 25 lens filters for high contrast viewing clouds etc.  While I was scanning some edges of a few clouds and some contrails looking towards the west over the ocean around 2:30 pm I noticed one very outstanding whitish looking object, between egg and football shaped but sometimes looking more round and other times having more of a top shape.  I had to assume that possibly the changing viewing angle had something to do with shape change although at times the object(s) seemed to either be vibrating or rotating.  That object suddenly appeared and was very slowly moving towards the ocean and back nearly directly overhead just above where I live.  As I continued watching I noticed another object moving very slowly, coming directly out of the setting sun direction and moving very slowly in direct horizontal line towards the first object in what looke! d like a collision course.  The first object seemed to stop and just hover while the other approaching object drew closer.  As the two got very close the second flew past the first above it then as they got further away from each other they began to move in tandem, then going from perpendicular to a horizontal position and moved from north-west to south-east in tandem then they seemed to break off formation and slowly spread one to the west while the other seemed to more or less hold its position at about a 50-80 degree angle to my viewing position.  These objects went from a white color to sometimes a shimmering metallic or reflective mylar look but it wasn't solid looking when it began shimmering it seemed to flash as if it had multiple surfaces.   As I continued to view the two objects I watched a third that seemed to drop down from above my focus to an altitude similar to the other 2 objects and north of them again the three maneuvered back into a horizontal line with quite a bit of distance between each other.  After that maneuver, they then b roke the line and moved closer to form a triangular formation and slowly moved out towards the ocean and then back towards my viewing position. After watching these slow manuvers for some time I noticed a 4th and 5th object materialiing or moving from very high in the sky down towards the other objects and as these other two became about the same size as the others they all formed another horizontal line from north to south, evenly spaced, and kept that formation for a short while then the orginal two pretty much stayed at the same altitude and eventually moved appart and one went west into the sun set and flew into a contrail that was left by a passing aircraft while the other stayed in my viewing location at anywhere from 50 to 80 degrees angle to my location.  The other additional 3 slowly moved west outside of my location viewing as roof lines and trees blocked me from following them and by this time my arms were getting tired of holding binoculars plus it was getting darker and the red filters were losing affect and just darkening my vision.  Also when I tried viewing without the red filters or with just my naked eyes but without the filters, the objects weren't visible to me. I will check again on Sunday around the same time and see if my elusive objects return to the area.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002

All of a sudden a pulsating shape appeared out of the white fog. It was grey and seemed to be like a large jellyfish. Changing shape from circular to oval. It moved slowly in the sky from south to north. Thenâ€¦ we saw another one. Much smaller this time but right near the other one. Same grey color. I called my husband who lived nearby but he saw nothing. All 8 of us stopped playing. We got a couple photographs and a video.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Two unidentified flying objects over Carlsbad on Friday, August 6, 2021;2021-08-06 10:48:00;3 minutes;Two unidentified flying objects over Carlsbad on Friday, August 6, 2021 On Friday, August 6, 2021 I saw an unidentified flying object.  I would say the time was 10:48 a.m.  I was standing on the tennis courts at La Costa resort in Carlsbad, CA.  When I looked up at the sky (facing east) I was something in the sky.  At first, I thought it was a balloon high up, but then thought maybe it was a blimp.  It was too high to be a balloon, but changing shapes, so too inconsistent to be a balloon.  I pointed it out to my tennis partner.  After we watched it for several seconds, we pointed it out to the other 2 women on the court.  We then told the other 4 women next to us about it.  The 8 of us watched it for 2-3 minutes.  At one point there was a 2nd object in the sky close by.  It was changing shape, like a cloud of smoke.  One lady said it was like a jelly fish which I thought was a good analogy.  After 2-3 minutes, they both disappeared into the clouds to the northwest, over the water.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
