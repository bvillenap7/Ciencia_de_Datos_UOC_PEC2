The Fire Ball floated down out of the fog layer that was less than 100 ft high.  It floated down within 20 ft of me where it opened up a hole in the flames, I then observed something within the fire, for about 15-30 sec.  After that the opening closed, and the Ball, about the size of a 30 ft  square, seemed to turn and fly away toward the ocean, I went inside and back to bed, I think, pretty sure, I slept till 7 am, the effect seemed to last for three days. Or at least I do not remember being thirsty, I may have drank water during that time but I do not remember being thirsty or hungry, thou I may have eaten something during those couple of days after but again I don't recall.  Which is funny because I may have eaten a lot, my digestive function was strange, and then it went back to normal.  I did get a small peek of the Ship, when it turned away, some structural beams, giving a major insight as to the overall look of the craft inside the fire.

I saw 3 bright;2011-10-01 21:20:00;10 seconds;I was driving south on the 5 Freeway this evening.  I was passing Canon Road in Carlsbad, San Diego County, California.  I saw 3 bright orange lights at 9:20 pm Satuday, October 1.  These lights were only about 200 feet high and just east or inland from the freeway.  Thousands of people had to have seen them.  They were not planes.  They were not flares.  The only possibility, besides UFO's, was Chinese Lanterns.  I have never seen Chinese Lanterns but I don't think that's what they were because these were low enough, if they were Chinese Lanterns, I should have seen the balloon part illuminated by the flames.  Plus, these lights seemed like they were larger than I would expect a Chinese Lantern to be.  The lights were about the same size as a police helicopter light at 200 feet but again, the lights did not shine light down----they were just bright orange lights---very bright. I was driving with my window down.  I did not hear a helicopter sound.  I pass Camp Pendleton Marine Base all the time----if these lights were helicopters, the helicopters would have easily been heard.  In fact, they would have been loud.  I heard nothing.  And I did not have the radio on. These fiery lights were orange (and one may have had blue on top).  The lights were a different color than any police helicopter light.  The lights were low.  2 of the lights were almost above the freeway, and the third light was more inland so I got a good look at the 2 lights.  Anyway, I saw the 2 lights for about 10 seconds---again, as I was driving.  These 2 lights were not connected they moved independent of each other.  I have seen many hot air balloons in Del Mar area.  These lights were not hot air balloons. The wind was calm tonight.  2-5 mph.  I checked the weather channel as soon as I got home (about 10 pm)----winds were variable about 2 mph.  These lights were moving more than 5 mph (more like 30 mph) and heading north along the freeway ( I was driving south).  I did not look very much at the third light-----I focused on the 2 closest lights.  Again, These lights were low.  My guess is a couple hundred feet.  They were bright but did not emit towards the ground.  The lights were not flares.  There were no sparks or smoke being emitted from the lights. I don't know what they were.  Carlsbad in about 15 miles north of the air show at Miramar----which did occur earlier this evening.  These were not helicopters or other air craft.  I see military jets every day. It will be interesting to see if others. There had to have been thousands of people driving on the 5 freeway at 9:20 pm Saturday night October 1. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar sighting reports from the same source.  Other sighting was over San Diego at 22:05 hrs. on Thursday, October 06, 2011.

Two orbs hovering over military base for an hour or more.;2014-06-18 23:00:00;~1 hour;Two orbs hovering over military base for an hour or more. I was leaving my moms house in Encinitas and saw 1 just hovering and I thought it was just a plane coming in to Palomar Airport.   Then as I was driving I noticed that it wasn't moving.  As I got closer to my home, it was still in the same position, which to me looked like it was about 500 ft high and over the beach in front of Camp Pendleton Marine Base and when I got home I began to film with my cellphone.   About 5 minutes into filming, it started to pulsate or blink very faintly and after a few seconds another orb showed up.  They were both hovering there for awhile and then the first one faded away.  After a couple minutes the second began to blink and the first one just appeared in its original position.  They repeated this a few times and after 17 minutes of filming they both slowly faded away.   From the time I left my moms to the time they left was about an hour.  But they could have been doing that for hours because one of them was there when I looked in the sky while getting into my car at my moms.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002

These were the same objects another person and myself had seen in July that I had reported on your sight.  These objects are capable of floating up into high elevations.  I know you have asked if we had any idea what they might be, this is what we saw and watched. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

A red ball of fire flew directly over my car along the coast, where aircraft arn't permitted to fly at a speed of appx. 900 mph;2015-01-07 17:25:00;2 minutes;A red ball of fire flew directly over my car along the coast, where aircraft arn't permitted to fly at a speed of appx. 900 mph 	I was driving southbound on Highway 101 in Carlsbad, CA. at approximately 9:25 pm, the air was clear and I can see the lights off int the distance of Point Loma near San Diego clearly.  A red glowing object flew directly over my car.  I thought that it was a meteorite because of the brightness and the way that it seemed to blur as it moved across the sky flying directly southbound along highway 101.  I was driving at a speed of 50 miles per hour and I assumed that it would burn out seconds after I saw it, but it did not, it continued on, in a straight trajectory, not losing any altitude. 	The next thought that I had was that it was going as fast as a missile and, living in Oceanside, Ca near Camp Pendleton, it may have come from there.  My confusion turned to concern, knowing that it had no other flashing lights like the jets that land at Carlsbad Airport or the commercial jets that fly southbound along the coast over the ocean.  The only other aircrafts that fly along the coast above the land are the police helicopters that fly over head at times, but mostly over the water. 	I continued following it down the coast, rarely taking my eyes off of it so as to keep my car on the road.  The light was very bright at first, like a meteorite, bigger that Venus when you can see it on a clear night and it’s closest to the earth.   I had kept my eyes on it for about 2 minutes when I saw that it had seemed to be flying over the Sea World tower, approximately 30 miles away.  I had reached Leucadia, Ca, and couldn’t see past the cliffs at this point, but at my last view it had traveled far enough so the light was just a speck in the distance. 	In my approximations, the light was about 1000 feet from the ground and traveling at a speed faster than the F15s from Miramar Air Force Base. 30 miles in 2 minutes would equal about 900 miles per hour.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Fireball orb seen over North San Diego Co. out over Pacific Ocean.;2017-05-28 00:53:00;30 seconds;Fireball orb seen over North San Diego county out over Pacific Ocean. I saw a red fireball that was fairly big it looked to have been coming towards in an east-southeast direction. I then told my fiancé to look at it as I thought that it was strange, she did look, then I looked back and blinked my eyes once and it de-laminated!  Amazing!  About five minutes later there was another small one same color.Fireball;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
