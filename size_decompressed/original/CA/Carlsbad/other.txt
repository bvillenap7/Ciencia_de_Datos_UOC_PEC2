I was at the Hilton Hotel at Palomar Airport Road and Carlsbad Blvd (Pacific Coast Highway) 6450 Carlsbad Blvd, Carlsbad, California.  I was walking north east toward the hotel, when I noticed an object flying over the ocean very low and near the shore.  This object appeared to look like a string of lights, a large red light at the base and approximately 4 or 5 smaller blue lights up higher.  I was walking near another person and I asked her if she was able to see it, she stated, “I had noticed it while I was driving into the parking lot it must be some sort of radio controlled toy”.  We stood their and watched it fly.  It was flying, in sort of an undulating motion, south and turned back and went north for a few moments and then turned south again.  The object then flew straight up and continued to gain altitude until it looked like a white star and disappeared.  This whole event lasted approximately 3 minutes.  She dismissed the whole incident, but I said, “It looks like it might be a UFO, because a radio controlled toy doesn’t do that and disappear”.  We then walked into the hotel.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Saw 2 chem-trails  flying over SD Co. going 2 different directions for approx 7-10 mins before...disappearing!!!;2010-06-21 16:45:00;approx.  10 min;Saw 2 chem-trails  flying over SD Co. going 2 different directions for approx 7-10 mins before...disappearing!!! Yesterday afternoon, I was outside in my backyard. I looked to the west, towards the pacific ocean. Im Approx 2 miles or so from the coastline. I saw 2 chemtrail planes (fake..maybe.. don't know.)  Flying approx 20-25000 ft. towards the west. they were both seperated by approx  1-4 miles. Actually one was going south-west, and the other one due west..The one going due west,I watched for about 3-5 mins..then I started watching the other chemtrail, when I re-turned eyes to the westbound chem trail..it was gone.. After that one disappeared, I watched the other one for another 3 mins or so...and then that one disappeared also.. VERY strange....oh and another strange thing about this.. This 2nd one that was going south west, suddenly changed direction to due west.. then changed direction again this time going due north!!!... I have NEVER seen a chemtrail do that...EVER! Then after it changed direction to the north...it just vanished....VERY BIZARRE!  Anyway, thats my siteing story..total time approx 7 to 10 mins.  Thanks for your site, thanks for letting us all post on here. God bless. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Eagle-looking object  hovering over my location for appx.  5 seconds...then darted off at high speed.;2010-09-01 17:25:00;5 secs.;Eagle-looking object  hovering over my location for appx.  5 seconds...then darted off at high speed. Okay..this is what happened.I was layin' out in the sun on the chairs-lounge in my backyard on my back.I was just layin' there lookin' straight up...and I saw this object just hovering stationary in the sky, appx. 500-1000 feet, in the air directly above me. I remained motionless, with my sunglasses on..so maybe this object (the occupant's) thought I was asleep.. I don't know..but I must have moved my head, or arms, slightly because..  as soon as I did that,the object darted off at a VERY HIGH rate of speed..my guess 1000's of mph, behind the limb's of my tree. Thats when I lost sight of it.  The only thing I can compare it to, as far as discription, is that, to me, it looked like an eagle...with one wing spread out. That's what I originally  thought it was...until it took off.   Anyway..that's what I saw.  Has anyone seen a ufo disquised as an eagle.If so, I'd like to hear about it! ....because this thing was way TOO FAST to be that.

Object moved up and down 2 times with sharp movements.;2013-03-21 20:45:00;:45 seconds;Object moved up and down 2 times with sharp movements There was a big green light with 3 small green lights in a row on the side. So the lights lined up horizontally.  The craft moved up vertically  in sets of three ( moved up stopped, moved up stopped, moved up stopped) then dropped at a constant rate.  It did this 2 times.  The lights went away then it was gone;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Shiny Drone like formation object seen by 1;2019-10-24 11:25:00;1 minutes;Shiny Drone like formation object seen by 1 UFO sighting on 10/24/2019 in Carlsbad CA around 11:25am  I saw a shiny flying object over North sky at the intersection of Alicante road and Alga road in Carlsbad CA today. I was driving my husband to his appointment around 11:25 am today.  As I was stopping at the traffic light on Alicante Road facing North, I saw a very unusual looking object in the North sky, in the direction right behind the traffic light.  The object looked like a formation of four or five shiny light, almost like a gigantic drone look.  I saw it flying or hovering in the direction of North sky for a couple of second.  Then it disappeared for a few second.  Then it re appeared for another couple of second.  Then disappeared once again.  I had to drive away after the signal turned green, so I don't know if it kept flying over the sky after this. I asked my husband to take a picture of it with his phone while this happened.  But he was not looking at the same direction as I was, so he was not able to take a picture.  He did not see it. I don't think it was a drone because of the size and very random place and time.  If it was a drone flying near the traffic light, I should be able to see as a drone.  This was flying far and high.  It was not a regular airplane nor helicopter I see everyday.  I’ve never seen something like this.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002

I woke up and laid still staring at the red orb the size of a soccer ball just outside of my bedroom sliding doors. I have long dark curtains but I could see the round brightly glowing red orb through the curtains.  It stayed still for a time, there appeared to be movement inside the orb, like it was glowing, almost like a fire. I closed my eyes for a moment to be sure I was not seeing things.  When I opened them, the orb had moved to the other side of my sliding door.  It stayed there for a few minutes, then disappeared suddenly. I was afraid to get out of bed or try to pull my curtains open.  My husband was asleep and I did not want to disturb him as he sometimes does not sleep well. I sleep with a fan on at night, so I am not sure if the red orb emitted any noise.  It may have been drowned out by my box fan noise. I had seen a UFO years ago in the daytime in GA while I was driving with my children in my van, so when I saw this red orb I felt it was not something man made. I felt as though it was spying on us through the window, so I felt it was best if I laid still and did not move until it left.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002

It’s hard to describe on paper, I was siting down at a restaurant and I saw this lady walking down an alley way and she had extremely gorgeous hair that caught my attention and my friends attention. How ever she also looked disheveled and had a interesting gate. When I looked at her face it was not human. She had snake looking eyes and a snake looking nose with a very wide mouth like a reptile. I elbowed my friend and asked if he saw that and he said I saw her hair. When I turned my head to look at her again she was staring right at me in a crowd of people like it knew I saw what it really was. It sounds crazy. But it happened in broad daylight and I’m still shooken to my core from this experience. Also it was like time slowed around me.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
