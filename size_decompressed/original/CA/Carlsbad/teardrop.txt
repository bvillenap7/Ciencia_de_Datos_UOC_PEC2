Pinkish Lightbulb shape over neighborhood;2002-09-21 18:30:00;18-19:00;Pinkish Lightbulb shape over neighborhood Driving North on Rt5, came over a hill before Batiquitos Lagoon and saw a lightbulb shaped thing over the far shore/neighborhood, hovering and low. It was a frosted light as if lit from inside and had no markings on its uniform surface. The color was a pink-orange. At first I thought it was a hot air balloon (about the same size)but a second or two after seeing it, it turned off like a light switch and could no longer be seen in the dark. There are hot air balloons around Del Mar some miles to the South, but none fly low over houses in the dark, nor do they fly that far North. I called the golf course below it (4 Seasons)off of Poinsettia Lane to see if they had a promotional balloon up but they said they don't do things like that. ps Could you perhaps include a space to write in the UFO shape on yr form? Thanks.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
