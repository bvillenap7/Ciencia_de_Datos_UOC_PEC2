Slow moving horizontal white light seen over the Pacific;2004-03-07 17:00:00;20 to 30 mins;Slow moving horizontal white light seen over the Pacific In my car, turning onto Carlsbad Bl. (which parallels the ocean shore) from Chestnut St. at approx 5 pm looking due west over the Pacific Ocean about 60 degrees in the sky I observed a horizontal thin light with 4 barely visible light streaks emanating up from it. At arms length the length of the light was about 1 inch. I looked for strobe lights or other indications that it was a plane or other terrestrial craft, but saw none. I stopped and got out of my car and asked a couple walking along the street what they thought and they said they had noticed it but didn't know what it could be. As I turned and drove north on Carlsbad Bl., the object moved north as well. It seemed to stay at about the same angle to/from me. After a mile I stopped again, completely awestruck at this obvious UFO (wht else could it be?) in broad daylight. At a Starbuck's near where I stopped, I approached a guy drinking coffee and pointed to the object. He said sometimes there is a kind of light blimp that goes along trhe coast but it doesn't look like that. He said he thought it might be a comet, but I mentioned there was no tail and it seemed to move at irregular speeds/intervals. Anyway, I got back in the car, drove north a few more miles, observing the object. I stopped one more time and pulled out a pair of binoculars (7X50) that I have in the car. Through the bonoculars it was hard to focus and it didn't give much of a better view, which leaves me to speculate that it was a huge cigar shaped or rectangular ship, way far away. I've heard of ships supposedly hundreds and even thousands of miles long and this could one of those that was hundreds of thousands or even millions of miles away.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Long thin black line floating in the sky;2012-08-31 12:00:00;1hour or more;Long thin black line floating in the sky and moving eastward. Object turns white sometimes at top and bends left and right, gets shorter and longer at times.  But always stays upright  Looks like a &quotCoin slot&quot in the sky.  Watched it for over 30mins and it moved east about 1000 yards. There was no plane putting it so it wasnt an air sign.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Large bright long light sitting on Pacific Ocean's horizon off coast of Carlsbad, California.;2016-05-24 06:30:00;5 minutes;Large bright long light sitting on Pacific Ocean's horizon off coast of Carlsbad, southern California. 6:30am Tuesday, May 24th, 2016...  Our backyard looks west towards the Pacific Ocean where we can see San Clemente Island, and just north of that is Catalina Island.  We noticed this very bright long light sitting on the ocean horizon.   At first thought it was the Sun's reflection, but that would be impossible for the Sun's location at that time.  Then thought it may have been a cruise ship, but have never seen one out there before, plus on closer look, through binoculars, we couldn't see any body of structure, just either one long bright light, or big lights close together looking as one.  The lights were stationary.  No movement, no flashing, no noise. nothing.  Just stationary, perched on the water's horizon.   My wife and I watched it for about 5 mins, then went inside.  About 5 mins later I went to check on it and it had completely gone...  I have a photo on my cell phone.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
