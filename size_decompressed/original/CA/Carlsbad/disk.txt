3 flying saucers hovering above a flower field in clear daylight;1975-03-20 16:00:00;20 seconds;3 flying saucers hovering above a flower field in clear daylight I was in the front seat of my neighbors car, being driven up to Carlsabd to take their dog to a pet hotel for Easter vacation. I looked out the window and clearly saw 3 silver flying saucers hovering above a big field of red flowers. They had a slight woble to them as they were sitting stationary in the air about  200 feet up. They had a circular pattern of red and white lights around the bottom and were about 40 feet across. I also remember seeing a small antennae on top of their dome.  I revisited the site recently and estimated that we were between half and a quarter mile away as we were driving closer.  After about 20 seconds, within a blink of an eye they were gone. I was twelve at the time and was very impressed by what I saw and told my folks about it as soon as we got home. The next morning when I awoke to my radio alarm clock, set to KCBQ, the DJ announced that over 150 people phoned in to report seeing 3 flying saucers throughout San Diego County. This event ocurred in clear daylight and I often wonder about what flew these things and where they come from. They seemed to be checking out the impressive sight of the red flowers from above. Thanks for letting me share! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
BRIGHT WHITE SAUCER LANDS IN ROAD!!!  ((NUFORC Note:  Unconfirmed report.  Witness remains anonymous.  PD));2004-03-09 03:20:00;dont know;((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous uses profanity in report.  We cannot confirm that this is a serious report.  We have received no other reports from this part of California for this date.  PD)) BRIGHT WHITE SAUCER LANDS IN ROAD!!! I know you guys are pretty open minded to have a website like this and for this story you will need to be.  I dont care if you believe me or not, it happened.  I was on my paper route in my car this early morning at 3:20, I recall the time distincly because I changed the radio to a song I liked at that time.  I was driving on Carlsbad Village Drive, and about a quarter mile to Tamarack road I experienced something.  Now it being so early there was nobody on the road except me.  I was driving about 25-30 MPH when I saw a real bright light in the sky about the size of the moon.  I was totally baffuled by what I saw and I pulled over to catch a better glimpse of it.  I am an avid listener of the coast to coast am radio program so I'm very interested in UFO's and such.  It got bigger as time passed and it looked like closer.  About 1 minute passed and all of a sudden it just disappeared.  I was very disappointed but at the same time going crazy and shouting and yelling what ((deleted)) is that????  Then after 10 seconds of dead silence the round bright object landed RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!!  It was circular and glowed very brightly.  It was probably 25 feet tall and 100 feet from side to side.  I'm only guessing on the estimates, real rough numbers.  I was so stunned I felt like I was going to have a heart attack.  Then I heard a voice as if somebody was talking gently into my ear.  I looked around a didnt see anybody around me.  All of a sudden the craft didn't glow anymore and on the side of the craft it said FUTURE  The Voice said nobody else can see this but you.  we are from the future.  you are the representative now of the future for this mass.  please lead or their will be dire consequences  I remember every single ((deleted)) word it said.  It talked very slowly and clearly in perfect english.  I still couldnt see anybody but the craft and after it stopped talking i shouted who the hell are you???? and EVERYTHING JUST DISAPPEARED.  After about 10 minutes of me shaking and hyperventilat! ing and me getting weak in the knee's I went back into my car and started it back up.  I then reached Tamarack Road and I looked at my clock in my car and it read 3:02.  I was so stunned.  I immediately drove home and just sat for a few hours at my kitchen table stunned and thinking what to do next.  Then i got on the internet and searched for about an hour until I've come to this site.  My heart is still at a million beats per second. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was driving south on Interstate 5 when I noticed a silver disc shaped craft in the sky about one mile ahead just past the Palomar Air;2004-08-25 10:10:00;10 seconds;I was driving south on Interstate 5 when I noticed a silver disc shaped craft in the sky about one mile ahead just past the Palomar Airport exit and at an altitude of about two thousand feet.  The craft was silver then turned whitish then became translucent and then disappeared.  I was amazed at this changing of the craft and it reminded me of the old buck rogers serials of the 1930's and was very beautiful to see.  About a year and a half ago I reported seeing a similar craft on Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad about three miles from this location.  This craft was identical but I saw it from a different angle and no lights were visible.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Shinny golden matalic disk/sauser shaped object seen for 2-3 secs....then disappeared!;2010-06-26 16:55:00;3 seconds;Shinny golden matalic disk/sauser shaped object seen for 2-3 secs....then disappeared!   Today's incident:  I was outside in the backyard getting some sunshine, and as I was looking up towards the south-west, at about 1 or 2 o'clock, I saw a shiny matalic object, moving rapidly (I say 200-500 mph) in the sky towards the south-east at about 2,000 to 5,000 ft. It had a bright golden/matalic glow to it. I saw it for only 2 or 3 seconds and then....it disappeared. There were clouds in the sky, but where I saw the UFO flying, it was perfectly clear and deep blue...It didn't go inside/behind a cloud,like alot of reports suggest...it just vanished..into thin air!!!  I'm almost 51, and have had numerous siteings in the span of my lifetime. Incident # 2 : I also want to mention an incident that occured last winter(nov. or dec.) I was laying in bed.It was early morning,and I had just woke up.I suddenly became aware of some type of communication (could have been telepathic) coming from somewhere.The communication asked me,  Do you want to come watch us leave...It startled me BIG TIME..because it was in my thought pattern. I believe I could have been abducted earlier that morning or night. The only way I can describe it was that it sounded like an insect talking.. If that makes any sense..like a praying mattis..or something like that. VERY strange!  If anyone else out there has had a similar experience, I would like to hear/ read about it.  I'm 100% sane, with an IQ in the 130 + range..so I'm NOT some loony-tune. Anyways..oh yeah..I like to hear from an expert on ufo abductions, if possible.I believe I've been abducted in the past also. Thanks. God bless.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Green saucer strobes in and out of sight into horizon;2012-11-18 00:40:00;1-3 seconds;Green saucer strobes in and out of sight into horizon My friend was driving me home.  She pulled out of her parking spot and we drove down the street about a block. We were facing north at a stop sign.  I saw from the corner of my right eye a light flying north as well. It was moving at an incredible speed.  Way too fast to have been an airplane.  At first i thought it was a comet but it started turn on and off (would disappear and reappear, it did this 2 times) and was mint/pine green in color. I say it for about 1-3 seconds before it flew out into the distance.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Two bright, orange, disc-like UFO's over the Carlsbad/Oceanside/San Marcos area.;2014-08-25 22:20:00;25 minutes;Two bright, orange, disc-like UFO's over the Carlsbad/Oceanside/San Marcos area I saw two disc-like, bright, orange UFO's hovering to my north as I drove northbound on interstate 5 freeway while I was around Carlsbad and Encinitas.  They were quite a bit north in the distance, but seemed bright and too large.  They were not flashing the usual red lights as helicopters would, and their flight patterns seemed erratic. My sister saw one of them as well while driving in San Marcos, which is not too far from Carlsbad and Oceanside, at around the same time.  Sometimes, one would disappear, then reappear. I have seen one before just like these a few months ago, in the same area.  It was hovering over the freeway.  It appeared bright orange from a distance, but as I drove nearer, it started changing colors from orange, to dark blue, to green, to red.  It looked like a sophisticated LED lighting system that completely covered the surface of the craft.  The color change would start at one point, then spread over the craft with the new color.  It felt as if it was putting a  light-show for me.  I looked at other cars on the freeway in disbelief, but no other drivers were paying attention.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
The craft appeared from the direction of the ocean and they were the brightest lights ive ever seen in my life, bright orange.;2019-06-06 20:00:00;20 minutes;The craft appeared from the direction of the ocean and they were the brightest lights ive ever seen in my life, bright orange, blazing and large not high like stars, but just above in the sky.   The first craft turned off his light and as it moved on slowly away north, I could see its dark silhouette in the still light evening sky. It was a dark craft and it had mechanical looking structure on the top.  It looked larger than a large jet.  I saw at least seven.  I could hear no sounds of engines.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
