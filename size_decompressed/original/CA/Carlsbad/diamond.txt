I was watching the discovery channel today regarding UFO's over Phoenix and noticed a triangular shaped object, which I have seen before.  I'm not sure about the exact date of the occurance, as it happenned almost twenty (20) years ago, but when I saw the triangular image today, it confirmed my observation in Carlsbad CA, of a diamond shaped object hovering over the Pacific Ocean.  My dad and I were out on our balcony after dinner, around 9:00pm, when we noticed the diamond shaped object, hovering over the Pacific for about two (2) minutes.  Then without any sound or vibration, the diamond shaped object flew directly over our condo, at an extremely high rate of speed.  Then two (2) air force jets, which had to be scrambled out of Mirimar air force base, attempted to follow the diamond over our condo, but when compared to the speed of the diamond, the jets were no contest. The reason I am writing this today, is because your organization might care.  You might be able to reference Miramar's records to confirm a scramble. Again, my recolection is 19 years coming.  I might even be a year off, but if there are records available regarding the Air Force's action, it may give you some answers.
