I can pinpoint the location of the sighting because I was on my couch looking upward to the second loft window toward the northwest sky. The object was transparent with cylindrical features with red and green colors - it had a cross section area with four smooth edges. I saw it for less than 5 seconds. I first noticed a bright light and then the UFO moved down and to the left and disappeared quickly. There was no exhaust.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
Palomar Airport near collision of object with plane.;2014-07-11 11:30:00;2 minutes;Palomar Airport near collision of object with plane. I work in a warehouse located in Southern California.  Standard cloudless, blue sky.   I was looking out of my office window and watched a plane taking off from Palomar Airport, about 5 miles away.   In that plane's line of trajectory, I observed an object that appeared to fly directly into the path of that plane, but make a sudden 180 degree change in direction before impact.  As I watched, it disappeared in the blink of an eye.  The object was silver in color and larger than the plane in my field of view.  It appeared to turn, hover, then disappear.
