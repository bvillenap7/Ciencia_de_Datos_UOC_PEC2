sphere with black bottom, mirrored top;2004-05-29 14:35:00;15 MIN;sphere with black bottom, mirrored top I am at work right now, and as I stepped out for a smoke,  I saw a metallic object slowly, and I mean slowly approach from the west heading east. No noise was heard.  I am about 3 miles from the beach and the costal winds were blowing from west to east at this time.  I thought it might have been a balloon since lego land is down the road, but it altered it's course and began heading south.  The bottom of this object seemed to be jet black in color, while the top looked as if it were mirrored because the sun reflected off of it with tremendous brilliance.  The object would wobble back and forth every 6 seconds or so. that's how I noticed the mirrored top.  I watched it until it moved out of view, still heading south along the coast.  Numerous aircraft clutter the airspace because palomar airport is down the street.  compared to landing aircraft, I would say the object was roughly the size of a volks wagon beetle and flying at 800ft or lower.  I have an extensive knowlege of known military applications and have experianced several UFO sighting both alone and with multiple witnesses.  It may have been a ballon, but a balloon is not going to turn south while the wind continues to blow east.;33.14116242647;-117.323322500002
