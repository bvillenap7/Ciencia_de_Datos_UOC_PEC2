Six UFO obererved for six hours in rural area outside of San Juan Bautista, California.;2007-03-28 22:30:00;6 hours;Six UFO obererved for six hours in rural area outside of San Juan Bautista, California. My girlfriend and I both saw over six UFO's last night along Rocks Road where I live. FOR REAL!!!! We noticed the first two at about 10:30 pm when I took my dog out for a walk and then stayed up observing the rest of them most of the night.  One was sitting in the field across the street from us (about 600 feet away).  Later, I got within about 200 feet another one that was smaller than the rest and it shined a light on me before flying off.  It hovered above Highway 101 for about fifteen minutes casting a light on the passing cars.  That one was only about four feet in diameter and a foot tall and the others were over 10 feet in diameter.  They all had similar lighting.  They left the area separately and they all flew in a northwest direction.  It looked like there was a mother ship hovering above that was much larger with different lighting. Took some pictures.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind these were UFO's;36.8444;-121.5392
