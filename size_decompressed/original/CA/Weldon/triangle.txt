soft green glowing object seen 40 miles west of Edwards AFB;2002-08-11 22:40:00;2-4 secs;soft green glowing object seen 40 miles west of Edwards AFB My wife and I were watching the sky for falling stars, the milky way was very evident on this nite we both observed an object, coming from the north on a straight projectory. it seemed to have a wingspan similar to a stealth. almost like a triangle though. it was slower than a falling star,but much faster than any plane I am aware of, it took 2-4 seconds to cross the sky.but it seemed to go perfectly straight.this is my first experience with anything like this, We would be very curious if anyone else saw this object.Right after the object passed we saw three falling stars.;35.6391;-118.2859
