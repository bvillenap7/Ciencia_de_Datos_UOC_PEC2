unidentified aerial entity / lifeform, shape changing, smoke colored / reflective / transparent, 40 seconds observation.;2006-12-23 15:10:00;40 seconds;unidentified aerial entity/lifeform, shape changing, smoke colored / reflective / transparent, 40 seconds observation. I don't know quite how to describe it.  It wasn't a craft in the usual association of the word, but it was a literal UFO.  It was large, between 80 and 110 feet long, and was approximately 700 feet up in the air.  It was smoke colored.  the sky was otherwise clear.  It was the darker smudge of a cloud in the sky that caught my attention.   I was driving in normal traffic.  This is a secluded area, in the mountains/hills.  When I saw it, i just looked at it because it was odd, it looked like a puff of smoke in the sky, but it was moving laterally, instead of vertically, as smoke usually does.  I watched it for a second ro two, and it ballooned out and took on an almost serpentine shape.  It expanded and collapsed in upon itself.  It seemed to be more of an entity than a craft, but I don't know.  I might have imagined it to be just a figment of my imagination, except, its persistancy was odd.  I hit my brakes and tried to keep a watch on it.  I drove under trees and could watch it ebtween the branches as I drove udner them.  I had no hallucinations either before or after this episode, and I was rested and stress free, having gotten off work 4 hours early due to an absence of clients.  It seemed to play in the sky.  And then, after about 40 seconds of watching it, it just collapsed in upon itself, and disappeared entirely.  I have no means by which to even try to explain this.  I have no knowledge of anything on record even close to it.  It seemed to be made of something semi reflective, or shimmery, and cloud/smoke colored.  It seemed to move as if it was an organic being.;38.5809;-122.5856
