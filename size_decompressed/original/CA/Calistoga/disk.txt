Black Ops or UFO?;2008-12-30 14:29:00;Three minutes;Black Ops or UFO? The following pictures shot on 30 December 2008 in the Napa Valley in Calistoga California on the grounds of Castello DI Amorosa display either an UFO or Military black operation.  The proximity of Travis Air Force Base to this location cannot be ignored due to the nature of this event. There were two very distinct and strange occurrences witnessed and attempting to digest, as what I was, witnessing did not relate to the disk that appears to be following the jet airliner. The fist strange occurrence was the absence of sound emanating from the jet engines, in a valley with foothills on either side you would expect to hear the roar of a jet flying at low altitude.  The second bit of strangeness was the air speed at which the jet airliner was moving, well below stall speed and technically should have fallen from the sky. The markings on the jet were indistinguishable so I raised my camera and started to shoot pictures of the jet, to my surprise, a brilliant flash of light just behind the jet appeared as I shot the first picture.  I looked at my camera and saw what appeared to be a disk like shape that was not visible to the naked eye. I continued to shoot pictures of the jet in sequence until it disappeared further into the valley.  Odd as it may sound you would think that a jet airliner with four engines would make some noise.  There were people all around shooting pictures of the castle and no one seemed to notice the plane. I still have the pictures on my flash card and would be interested in anyone who can provide high-resolution digital imaging as I have about 15 pictures in sequence of the airplane moving through the valley.;38.5809;-122.5856
