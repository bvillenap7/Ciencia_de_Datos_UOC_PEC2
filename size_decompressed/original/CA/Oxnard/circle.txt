There were bright white objects in the afternoon moving slowly in  the sky one of them emitted a smaller object.;2005-05-21 18:00:00;40 minutes;There were bright white objects in the afternoon moving slowly in  the sky one of them emitted a smaller object. These objects was seen by two persons and I, the sky was clear with abright sun.  First object that I saw was round and bright white. It almost look like staror planet but this seemed strange, a star or planet doesn't shine that bright after 6PM with a sunny sky. The object moved from west to east (and from east to west) slowly and sometimes I could not tell if it was moving because it moved so slowly.When it moved back and forth the object faintedto the point it was hard to relocate it.  Usually it fainted when it got closer to the sun but when it got further from the sun it begun to shine more.   After observing it for more than ten minutes this thing got my real attention and my jaw dropped. It emitted an object smaller than itself. The smaller object traveled northeast slowly but faster than the bigger object.  After that I did not know what happened to the two objects because I got distracted by a soccer game that my father was in.  When I look up again to the sky I could not relocate them. However after ten minutes I saw another object that looked the same at the same location of the sky. It's behavior moved the same (west to east and east to west slowly). A few minutes later it traveled only west not going back to east.(note:as it traveled west to the sun it kept its white color it didn't look like it reflected any orange,yellow colors caused by the sun)  As it traveled west it fainted and then another object heading toward it appeared about the same size but brighter coming from the northwest and traveling southeast. As I focus my eyes on this brighter object I could describe it had a faint red color, I could bearly tell it had a red color,if I didn't focus on it the color would be a bright white.  The objects looked like they were at the same altitude and almost made contact to each other as they got closer to each other . The object going west fainted and I observed it until my eyes couldn't see it.  The other object fainted as it traveled slowly southeast and kept my eyes on it until I couldn't see it.  About twenty minutes later the sky was a little dark but still bright, it was between 7:30 PM and 8:00 PM, I looked up to see any more sightings of more objects and just as I looked up a saw one. This object was bigger and I could distinguish another shape. At first it looked between a bent cigar and a small moon crescent then looked like a straight small cigar. It's color was a bright white,it's altitude looked the same as the other objects that I saw before and moved west slowly, its location was further northwest from the other objects that I saw. My father saw it as I told him about it and the other objects. There was another person that I told them about the first object that I saw and they also saw it.  The objects could not be ballons because at the altitude to which they looked they were at had to burst by the sun rays. A  high-altitude airliner, those planes that are way up high in the sky and leave a smog white trail, was able to travel under one of the objects and I was able to campare that the unknown object was about twice as high in the sky than the airliner's altitude.(The aircraft passed under the third object that I saw).  I hope that this sighting  is somehow useful and I give many thanks for the people for putting an easy  source to reach for the public to report ufos.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823

Silent circular Red glow moves slowly across the Oxnard sky lasting a minute or so.;2012-12-17 00:00:00;1 minute;Silent circular Red glow moves slowly across the Oxnard sky lasting a minute or so. Last evening I noticed a round red glow.  It was coming from southwest sky.  At first I thought maybe it was a fireball or comet or meteorite.  But it had no tail and did not burn out.  It kept moving across the sky, right overhead and then proceeded to the eastern sky.  It was completely silent and moved slowly, enough time for me to yell out to my neighbors and have them too, witness this unusual event.  We all concluded it must be UFO.  It finally started to get smaller and appear to move outwards disappearing beyond the clouds.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
White flashing light disc.;2015-04-11 18:10:00;Hour;White flashing light disc. At about 6pm, I observed a small white circle directly east of me.  It was floating in the sky traveling west.  Best way I could describe it as being a flashing white dot.  Followed by another SouthEast also heading west.  I observed a total of 7 all seperately, including one directly above me.   Then at 1906hrs, I noticed 4 of these white light dots in a V shape formation with one side having the extra white light . If anyone lives in the area. I've had several sighting this month and I feel that best times to view these white orbs are morning south southwest and before sunset facing east.  Especially on days with spuratic white clouds. My mother is my only witness.  When I saw the 4 lights, she could only see 2.  I have recorded 21 videos in the past 3 weeks of these White disc flashing light but only 1 could be considered worthy.   Hopefully someone in the area has good camera as my pictures and videos have been unfruitful.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
4 orange circular lights making triangular shapes then disappearing into the sky;2016-12-25 12:35:00;2 minute;4 orange circular lights making triangular shapes then disappearing into the sky As I was driving I looked I pulled up to the stop sign and directly in front of me about 1 miles away there were 4 round orange lights.  One was separate from the rest, but the remaining three were making triangular shapes.  They continued doing that for about a minute or so.  But then they started to fade away in the opposite direction as if flying towards the sky in a horizontal direction.  In the blink of an eye they were gone .;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823

((anonymous report));2018-10-22 23:30:00;8 seconds;White-blue orb the size of a round coffee table took off as soon as it was noticed with a comet like trail This ufo sighting was told to me by a very credible witness.  The sighting was too good to ignore and I had to report it here.  This happened on Monday 10/22/18 at around 23:30.   A group of friends in their early 20's were hanging out near the intersection of Channel Islands Blvd and Rose Ave., when one guy told the group to look up and notice this large round coffee table sized white orb with blue and green colors bordering the white light.  As soon all eight witnesses laid eyes on this ufo, it took off in a northerly direction leaving a trail like a comet.
