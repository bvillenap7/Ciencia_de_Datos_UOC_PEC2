big blue fireball very low;1971-12-25 08:00:00;2 seconds;big blue fireball very low I was walking with my mother (I was 12 y.o) to church on Christmas morning.  It was overcast when I suddenly remembered that the news said that a comet would be visible on Christmas day and that it could be the same one seen by the wise men.   I looked up and I saw a ball of blue light come out of the clouds and back into the clouds.  I saw the ball that was covered with blue flames, really beautiful like an aquamarine gemstone.  I could see the flames licking the surface of the object.  I told my mom but of course it was gone.  I felt very fortunate to have seen the comet.  I wasn't until a decade or more later that I thought, wait a minute, a comet isn't low enough to be in the clouds and it was traveling slowly.  I could have been my active imagination maybe.  If so then the mind is an incredible thing.  I saw it as clearly as any object is see before me now.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823

Nighttime BIG orange glowing orb sphere that slowly disappeared into the ocean.;2014-11-03 02:40:00;2 minutes;Nighttime BIG orange glowing orb sphere that slowly disappeared into the ocean. In the night sky hovering just above the ocean water, there was what looked like a big orange sphere which almost resembled what a sunset looks like only it was slowly sinking into the water at a much slower rate than a typical sunset...   Through my binoculars I could see it was a glowing orb that slowly disappeared into the ocean.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
Orange planet orb.;2014-11-27 22:20:00;3 minutes;Orange planet orb. I noticed the large orange orb over the ocean while my boyfriend was driving.   I told him to look over at it and he immediately pulled over to check it out.   The object was bigger than the size of the moon and sun.   We watched the neon orange object change shape and gradually disappear into the ocean. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting occurred at night, and have changed the time above.  The witness provides no contact information, so we are unable to contact her to confirm the time.  PD));34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
An orb of light came from the ground in the distance and continued toward my drone at a high rate of speed;2015-05-23 06:26:00;3 seconds;An orb of light came from the ground in the distance and continued toward my drone at a high rate of speed I am hobby drone pilot that owns two such crafts and have been flying for fun and amateur video for about a year.   On the morning I have indicated, I was flying my drone early one morning in a park very near my home and was recording as I normally do.  I shot this video at 1080P 60 FPS and did not notice the anomaly until viewing it later the same morning.  While shooting toward the sun and into the middle of town this orb of sorts came rushing toward my craft at a high rate of speed in a straight line but not straight at me.   At first I thought it might be a hummingbird, but seems much too fast and if you watch it pass into the lighter sky you will see that it just disappears as if it is made of light only.  The video I will send is clipped from a larger 4 gig file and if you want the whole file I can arrange that.  I would be very interested in any thought you may have regarding this anomaly.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
Bright turquoise glow in W sky a white light and white sphere-like obj. appeared. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:03:00;10 minutes;Bright turquoise glow in western sky from which a white light and white sphere-like object appeared, which was too high to be aircraft. Saw a bright turquoise light in the otherwise dark gray sky. A white light emanated from the turquoise light. A white object - sphere shaped - emanated from the white light and moved in a west-northwest direction. It was not a typical airplane as many planes fly overhead and this item did not look like a plane. It also appeared to be flying higher than normal aircraft. I watched the white light and sphere move slowly across the sky for about 20 seconds. I decided to take a photo with my iPhone. By the time I got my iPhone out of my purse, the sphere and white light dissipated then disappeared. However, the bright turquoise light remained in the sky for about 20 minutes. I was able to get a photo of the turquoise white and will email it to your address. I went online to see if a rocket it may have been launched from the West Coast (such as from Vandenberg AFB) and found nothing posted. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.

Approximately 12 red glowing lights moving in formation from north to east;2016-12-25 00:30:00;~15 minutes;Approximately 12 red glowing lights moving in formation from north to east At approximately 12:30 am on 12/25/16 I received a frantic call from my neighbor telling me to come outside right now. There in the eastern sky were six or seven red glowing lights in a circular pattern following each other in a spiral as they were moved further away, yet still following each other at about the same distance between, in a circular pattern until they disappeared. Then another by itself came out of the northern sky followed by another and then another and then another and another.  Each one followed the other towards where the circular group had been towards the east.  Then one by one they gained altitude and then disappeared. When we would spot a new red glowing light coming out of the north, they were larger and seemed at a lower altitude and were timed to be spaced out by about 20 to 30 seconds. There was no sound associated with these red lights.  No other color lights or glows were seen on each, just a solid red glow, that never changed. This lasted about 15 minutes.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
Date observed: Saturday 20 Feb 2021 Approx. time: 2130 while walking our dogs.;2021-02-20 21:24:00;~5-6 minutes;Date observed: Saturday 20 Feb 2021 Approx. time: 2130 while walking our dogs. Place sighted and where we were. The still pictures and video were taken from - Hollywood Beach CA. at the intersection of Los Feliz Ave. and Sunset Lane View: Looking out toward Anacapa Island (in the Channel Islands chain)-  Aircraft 'appeared' to be flying between Anacapa (which is 7 miles from the mainland from Hollywood Beach).  What we saw: Five extremely bright lights moving (flying ?) in a circular flight pattern which defied normal aircraft flight patterns and maneuvering (to include helicopters). The leader would disappear and circle around to come back in the picture frame on the right. The four kept equal separation/distance apart from one another. The leader would reappear from the right to rejoin the four. Appeared to be helicopters with bright lights when I zoomed in on one of the still pictures- also when the video is run in slow motion.  I've never seen anything like it before during my days of flying Huey's in the Corps and having a commercial pilots license (helicopter and fixed wing). Night formation flying is difficult- as you know- especially when the lead appears to shut off its light(s) and makes a fast turn to the right and returns to the formation on the right of the picture. Remarkable!;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
