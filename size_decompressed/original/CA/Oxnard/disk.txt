I thought it was a shooting star.......but boy was i mistaken!;2002-02-14 22:35:00;4-5 seconds;I thought it was a shooting star.......but boy was i mistaken! I was at the beach with my friends.  I'd gone a little ways past the place where everyone was sitting.  All I was thinking to do was sit and ponder about the many things i had on my mind.  As I looked up to look at the stars, I got to thinking that I'd never seen a shooting star.   I hadn't even had a chance to process the thought when i saw a star moving. At least i thought it was a star.  But it was moving too slow to be a shooting star and it wasn't shaped like a star, it had a more oval/saucer shape.  it glowed like a star but i knew that it couldnt be.  It soon disapeared.  It couldn't have been there more than 4 or 5 seconds, but it seened like a lifeime.  My friend, who'd been sitting a few feet from me, startled me when she ran up to me and asked if I'd seen it.  We began to discuss what we thought it was that we saw.  We came to the conclusion that there was no way that it was human. It had to be of a different place.  Not of this earth. ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of a flurry of reports we received from Ventura County, CA, following three telephone calls we received on May 18, 2002, from a raucous student party.  The reports seemed to us to be not convincing at the time of the call, a fact which we shared with the callers.  Shortly afterwards, approximately a dozen reports were submitted from that area.  We have no way of confirming any of these reports.  PD));34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
