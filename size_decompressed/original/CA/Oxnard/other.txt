low gliding large object with red light at front and back over Oxnard;2005-11-05 20:00:00;15 minutes;low gliding large object with red light at front and back over Oxnard I am a forty-three year old, college educated, Latino, living in Oxnard.  I live several miles Northwest of Point Mugu Base.  Several miles north of Port Hueneme Naval Base.   I had just walked from my garage going towards the back of the house when I noticed a rod shape object north in the sky.  The object was the size of three football fields and had a red light at the front tip and back tip.  The lights were connected by a dark mass.  Since this object was traveling diagonal from me it is hard to give an exact description of the shape for I was seeing it at a side view.  It was low in the sky for something that huge.  I would say approximately a mile off the ground.   The object moved slowly... guided.  There was no noise.  It headed from my north toward the Point Mugu base.  I got excited and ran into the house and called my brother (44 years old).  He came out and I pointed the object in the sky to him.  Once he spotted it I ran back in and called my father.  He came out with me and I asked my brother where the object was.  It was no longer visible for the house was in the way.  We all waked toward the front but were unable to locate the object.   We lost sight of the object roughly at where the Point Mugu base is located.  After calming down I went upstairs and looked out the window.   I saw another object and ran downstairs.  I called my brother again and we walked out, along with my nephew (10 years old).  I showed him the object in the sky but this was strange.  It appeared as if something was chasing something else in the sky.  I told he to listen... we could hear jets in the sky.  From where I live you are able to hear military jets from Point Mugu base.   I must have looked at the sky for an hour but so nothing more.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
Unusual movement for stars;2008-07-04 22:15:00;2 - 3 minutes;Unusual movement for stars My wife and I and friend had just finished watching fireworks on the fourth of July. We were on bicycles. After the fireworks had completed we then rode approximately 200 yards or so to the beach, my wife and friend was in conversation and I was just looking up at the stars. Then I noticed something that really caught my attention. I saw a star wobble back and forth I then pointed this out to my wife and friend. My wife noticed that there were two stars moving the same way. One was dimmer than the other. I kept me eyes on the brightest one. It was easier to see. It was really strange. They both looked like stars in the sky. There was no strange shape to them at all, they just looked like stars. They both zigged zagged back and forth a few times and then I didn’t see them anymore. We witnessed this for about 2 to 3 minutes it seems. Have there been any other reports of this event at all? I have always heard of things like this happening, but this is the first time that I have ever witnessed anything like this before.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
Golden UFO entering earths atmosphere emitting 3 objects then going back out into atmosphere;2009-02-24 02:00:00;3 minutes;Golden UFO entering earths atmosphere emitting 3 objects then going back out into atmosphere I was walking my dog at 2am 02/24/09 (about 26 minutes ago from writing this).  I noticed a VERY bright light in the sky.  This UFO incident appeared over towards the pacific ocean off the coast of Oxnard/Ventura county (my position). It had the appearence of a shooting star, or small meteor entering the atmosphere.  It was like a fireball and it glowed a bright red/orange color, so I knew something was entering the atmosphere.  I have seen small meteors enter the earth's atmosphere and burn for a brief second.  Well this UFO had been burning for about 30 seconds with a LARGE tail.  After I noticed it, it had emitted an object.  The object was glowing White, and VERY bright and not flickering.  The best way to describe this object would be a flare burning as bright as magnesium. *it was a great distance away so the material must have been rather large because it was burning so brightly i could see it and could not have been a hand flare because those are too small.*  The UFO emitted 3 of these objects.  As soon as the object emitted this bright white light, it stayed lit for 3 seconds, then it died out. As soon as the first object died out a 2nd one came and also for 3 seconds. As soon as that died a 3rd was emitted, and again lasted 3 seconds and disappeared.  When the 3rd object disappeared the UFO appeared to have slowed down its entry into the atmosphere and the glowing red/orange color dissapated away as it slowed down.  I noticed it left a smoke trail when emitting the bright white objects.  It was an awkward shape, large enough that I could see its shape and draw it out.  The UFO glowed a magnificent Gold color.  Then it was just hovering in the sky, and then slowly *from my position* started moving left and away from me *south west direction*.  It still glowed a gold color, and did NOT have any lights flashing on it, nor have ANY sound.  Something traveling that fast into the earths atmosphere should have set off a sonic boom. I waited and heard nothing.  It was traveling away fr! om me, h overing rather gently.  It was moving slowly, then started picking up speed and going higher UP INTO the atmosphere.  The gold color dimmed as it picked up speed, then got brighter 2 seconds later.  The gold UFO was flying off into the sky then the bright gold light was growing fainter, but I could still see it, then all of a sudden it VANISHED. BLACK. GONE.  I was stunned and amazed that I witnessed this event and called my girlfriend halfway into this.  I looked back where I had originally seen it and it left a trail of smoke and debree in the sky.  I kept walking my dog and the smoke still remained.  It had a spiral look to it and next to it another small smoke plume.  I am 19 years old male college student, I am not crazy, I have my head on my shoulders. I have great eye sight and do not wear glasses.   I witnessed this event and I remember seeing this website on TV so I decided to report the incident.  This was NOT a plane, nor a meteor.  This was something significant.  It came RUSHING down into the atmosphere, then emitted objects, hovered away and disappeared going back up into the atmosphere.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
