A moving fire ball over oxnard, ca morphing into a comet shape with tail.;2010-09-20 21:02:00;6 minites;A moving fire ball over oxnard, ca morphing into a comet shape with tail. I was heading west bound on Doris Rd pulling up to Ventura Rd. when I noticed what looked like a redish orangy light heading towards me in a slight southerly direction. I keep my eye on it driving by the open strawberry fields with not many cars on the road. It looked like a burning fireball in the sky as it got closer to me in my direction.It was coming it at around 500 to 1500 feet ruffly 3-10 miles out closing fairly quickly.  It looked like a bomb fire maybe the size of America eagle commuter plane. It floated slightly up and to the left then began to change shape and less concentrated. It then stretched out a very long hayleys comet like tail like a tapered cylindrical tube.  The new dimensions of the craft were ruffly 5x to 7X its longer then its brightest point as a flaming sphere.  I never took my eyes off of it as i was going straight down a almost empty 2 line rural road.  It appeared to have a light redish yellow haze or residue.  The end of the tai! l hung about 15 to 20 degrees below the natural horizon it then appeared to lose its tail and consolidate it's self into a perfect sphere still retaining its shape. It began to get smaller and smaller until it was directly over head and about the size of an average star. It still had a gray yellowish mist that slowly faded away.  I then reached the beach area going down 5th street and could nolonger see because of the street lights. a min later i was home looking in the sky for it reappear but it never did.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
UFO over Oxnard California Nov 5th 2010;2010-11-05 19:00:00;10 minutes;UFO over Oxnard California Nov 5th 2010 We were driving north on the freeway 101. Exiting Rose Ave.  We saw a large glowing ball with an orange tail.  At first it looked like any airplane but the it changed direction towards the pacific ocean.  It was traveling faster than an airplane.  It then just dissapeared for about 30 seconds... and then the glow reappeared in the distance and seemed to be going back into the sky and then it was gone..... super weird!!!  Also, there was no sound.  We also pulled over to the enear walmart and observed it while in the parking lot;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823

Green fireball darts earthward in south Oxnard sky, witnessed by two people.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a meteor?  PD));2015-10-10 22:30:00;1-2 seconds;Green fireball darts earthward in south Oxnard sky, witnessed by two people At around 10:30pm that particular evening a friend of mine and I were sitting on the tailgate of my truck observing the night sky. My attention was drawn to a flash of light almost directly ahead of us in the distant sky above the row of homes across the street. Heading earthward, this object or ball of energy was brilliant green and emitted a white glow or halo followed by a tail.  It was observed in the south Oxnard sky.  This story is fact and is supported by another witness.  I do speculate, however, that it crashed or entered into the ocean as I believe some of these fireball phenomena to be interpretations of submersible spacecraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a meteor?
