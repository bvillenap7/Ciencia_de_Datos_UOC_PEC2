Huge cigar shaped craft followed our power lines, continuing west out to sea.;1997-12-18 22:50:00;20-30 seconds;Huge cigar shaped craft followed our power lines, continuing west out to sea. I work at a power plant here on the California coast.  One moonless night, completely cloudless, I saw a huge cigar shaped craft slowly following our power lines in a westerly direction.  It continued without making a sound over my head and out to the sea where I lost it. Being a dark night I could not distinguish a color, but it was definitely metallic.  There are plenty of airports nearby and even a Naval Weapons testing facility, Point Mugu N.S., so we see a lot of airborne objects here, but I tell you that I've never seen anything like this. When I was in the Navy the ship that I was stationed on was 561 feet long.  This object easily surpassed this.  It was eery at the lack of sound that it made, none whatsoever.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
