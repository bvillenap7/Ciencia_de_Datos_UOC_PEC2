On Wednesday April 17, 2002 I had just returned home from attending a Centennial Committee meeting that had finished at Oxnard City Hal;2002-04-17 20:46:00;3-5 minutes;On Wednesday April 17, 2002 I had just returned home from attending a Centennial Committee meeting that had finished at Oxnard City Hall around 8:10 pm or so. After arriving back at my apartment complex, and as I was walking back to my apartment at around 8:30 pm, I stopped to chat with one of the maintenance folks who was standing outside the laundry room with his girl friend. Since it was a very clear night sky, I mentioned to them how bright the stars were, especially with all the evening fog we had been having.   As we were looking up at the moon and stars (we were facing west and looking Northwest), we noticed two very bright white objects - which at first I mistook for stars.  As we watched them though, we noticed that the bright white objects were moving from the northwest towards the south about the speed which airlines normally travel from LAX to SFO.  One was trailing the other very close - too close for conventional commercial aircraft in air corridors. As a matter of fact, these objects were traveling in the vicinity of the air corridor for air traffic flying between LAX and SFO, with the exception that they appeared very high in the sky - higher then normal air traffic would be.  Since I have a commercial pilots license (in-active pilot), I was trying to see the red and green wing tip lights that would determine they were either private or commercial aircraft.  After watching for a minute, I could never make out the shape of the object or see any wingtip lights.  After concluding that they must be commercial aircraft, I went up to my apartment and turned on the TV. Unfortunately, that was not the end of the story.  The next morning I saw the maintenance man who had watched the objects with me the previous evening.  He told me that had I stayed another 1 1/2 minutes and watched,  I would have seen something unexplainable for an ordinary aircraft to do.  Evidently, as the bright white objects were getting closer towards LAX, they separated with one shooting straight up and the other going up and out-of-sight at a very steep angle.  He thought that it might be a stealth aircraft but I told him that known military aircraft cannot achieve those kinds of speed. I have read other reports for April 17th which seem to mirror the events we witnesed. I have also read that what we witnessed may have been the ISS and Space Shuttle passing overhead.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823

Strange light seen above South Oxnard;2007-02-11 19:25:00;2-4 seconds;Strange light seen above South Oxnard While driving home, I just so happened to look up into the sky and see an abnormally bright light some ways off in the distance. From the time I saw it, it hovered there for a bit, turned to a light green hue, then the light went out. Almost as if one would hide the light from a match with their hand. During this time, no other stars were visible as I was in the city and there were no planes in the sky.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
Bright as a star it silently flew overhead turned red then disappeared into the night sky.;2008-06-08 22:00:00;10 min.;Bright as a star it silently flew overhead turned red then disappeared into the night sky. It was at 10:30 p.m. P.S.T. June 8th when I saw what seemed to be a plane flying south paralell with the coastline. As it moved closer it became really bright like a star at this point it was overhead and my girlfriend had just arrived. I told her to look up and she also saw this object traveling directly above us making no sound. It continued south but as it did the white light diminished and turned into an amber colored dot which quickly disappeared into the night sky. This happened on silverstrand beach in Oxnard, California which is right next to a naval C.B.C. base  and about 6 miles from Pt.Mugu naval airbase so I am used to seeing aircraft traffic overhead. I know for a fact it was not a plane because it was silent, super bright, and it disappeared into the sky.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823

Small to medium sized ball of light.;2014-04-25 21:19:00;00:30;Small to medium sized ball of light. Ball  of  light  was  flying  over  Northern  part  of  city,  about  50MPH,  more  or  less.  I  got  to  my  house  which  is  about  a  90  degree  angle  of  where  I  first  saw  it,  and  it  passed  about  200-300  yards  ahead  of  me  in  a  different  part  of  the  neighborhood. The  ball  of  light  must  of  stopped  at  some  point  and  “disappeared”  because  by  the  time  I would’ve  gotten  to  my  house,  if  it  continued  the  same  speed  and  path,  I  would  have  never  seen  it  in  front  of  me  as  I  was  pulling  in  my  driveway. There  are  a  few  large  trees  within  the  area,  but  it  was  clearly  visible  within  the  clouds.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
Three faint stars around two minutes apart flying north, They faded in and out and then disappeared. One flared up into a large light.;2014-06-25 22:00:00;40 minutes;Three faint stars around two minutes apart flying north, They faded in and out and then disappeared. One flared up into a large light. Me and two other friends were observing the flight paths of planes landing at Pt. Mugu Air Base and Camarillo airport.  One guy said to look at a certain patch of the sky that was directly above us.  We saw a light that looked like a faint star moving slowly through the sky going north.  A few times it would disappear and then reappear a bit down the way on the same path.  Then around a couple minutes later we saw a second one going in the exact same way, northbound.  The only difference is that this one was a bit more west of the first one. It behaved the same way as the first one by fading in and out at irregular intervals.  Then it flare up into a larger very noticeable light and then completely faded out of sight.  And then we saw a third one around five minutes later that behaved similar the first one, it did not flare up like the second one.  Then around 25-35 minutes later, we saw all three going back down south in a straight line, spaced apart similar to the! constellation orion. All three were the same size, they looked like regular faint stars. This was awesome to watch! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

4 red lights/orbs over Oxnard, California.;2014-11-15 21:15:00;2 minutes;4 red lights/orbs over Oxnard, California I saw 4 bright red glowing red orbs in the sky. The objects were moving in one direction very slowly.  The back 2 were getting closer and separating, one more than the other.  I went to go park my truck and got back to where I could see the lights but I couldn't anymore.   I walked back and forth in hope to see them again.  I looked up and saw one out of sudden.   I quickly got my phone camera and tried to take a picture but the camera lagged to take a picture.  The single orb I saw seemed to turn because the bright light started to fade out until if looked like a dim star until there was nothing at all.   The orbs seemed to come out strange to me because i knew they weren't planed  There weren't any flashing lights and airplanes don't flight like that. This was a solid red light moving eradically.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
Object arced over the Pacific Ocean above Oxnard.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.

First thought: helicopter. Then as it moved North, a very bright light shone from it illuminating the sky like a klieg light. It left a cloud behind, the only cloud appearing in an otherwise starry sky.  The light source slowly disappeared upward and outward in the sky until it was no longer visible.

The source of the light was round and the cone of light emanating from it was very bright...as that of a searchlight.  There was a light cloud formation above the area of the parking lot that we were all parked in at the time.  Even though the UFO/Light source was a distance away from the cloud formation, the light was intense enough to illuminate clearly the cloud material.  The object moved as if it were silently drifting across the night sky.  And as it moved further away, who could see the cone of light being beamed from its circular source.  The actual object creating the light could not be seen...ONLY the light and it's circular source. ((NUFORC Note:  Launch of Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg AFB.
