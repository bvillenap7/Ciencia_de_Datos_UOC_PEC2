Bright unusual lights in sky;2007-01-12 20:00:00;60 min;Bright unusual lights in sky I was having a conversation and I happened to look up and I seen a bright pulsating light too big to be a star that caught my attention. It seemed too be too bright to be a plane. As I watched this light for about two minutes as it slowed down and began to get smaller until it disappeared. About 15 minutes later I walked outside to smoke and I seen another bright light similar to the one I had previously seen. I was astounded to find at least five bright lights in the similar pulsating fashion. One of the lights seemed to be moving closer. I knew it was not a plane because I could only see one plane out there in that area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
