1 light turns into 4 (light show);1995-01-01 10:00:00;10 min;1 light turns into 4 (light show) i saw this about nine years ago but just read a report that exactly matched what i saw. that report was on 10/10/2002 in the  flash section of your website.  i saw one ball of light hundreds of miles away.  i continued to watch the light and witnessed it split into 4 lights making a diomond or box shape. these lights would have one light go out and come back on like they were trying to get attention. not fast flashes but would just go out. after they did the little  light show they all formed back into one ball. it then move a couple seconds east then spit into two lights. they seemed apart but kinda together in distance. these two lights formed into four lights each just as the one did just before. the light show went on for about 2 min and then they formed back into one ball each. the two lights then slowly moved east and vanished min after that. i remember quickly drawing what i encountered but have lost the drawing since. thank you for your time.

Morphing UFO from airplane/tic tac shape to suspended triangular shape over ocean using electromagnetic waves;2020-03-08 15:30:00;5 minutes;Morphing UFO from airplane/tic tac shape to suspended triangular shape over ocean using electromagnetic waves I walked on Hollywood beach in Oxnard, CA, and sat down to watch the ocean at approximately 3:30pm on 3/8/2020. I noticed many chem trails in the sky.  FAR more than normal.  I noticed a regular plane in the distance putting off chem trails and then out of no where (almost like it came through a portal) noticed what I thought was another plane but it was very low, giving off no fumes and making no noise.  As it started moving over the water I noticed it's appearance was more that of a large tic tac or balloon type shape kind of altering between silver and red.  As I stared at it the craft moved in a way I have never witnessed and morphed from that airplane/balloon look to almost triangular as it changed trajectory and it's nose then pointed directly at me.  As that happened I noticed everything went quiet a large electromagnetic type energy consumed me and the space around me. I could no longer hear the ocean waves, but I could hear and feel a heavy frequency of some type screaming in my head.  I could feel an energy coming from the craft.  I immediately got up at that point and started running back across the beach to where my car was parked and saying no no no.  I was truly afraid it was trying to abduct me.  But then again maybe it was just trying to communicate.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
