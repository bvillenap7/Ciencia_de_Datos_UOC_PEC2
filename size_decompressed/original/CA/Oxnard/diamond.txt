Oxnard sighting of duel colored craft;2002-05-21 01:15:00;15min.;Oxnard sighting of duel colored craft This object appeared to a friend and I as we were on break in the late shift for the park rangers and we noticed an orange light in the sky.  At first we thought it was a plane but it didn't move and after 10min. of staring at it the light became larger and brighter and continued to increase in size until it took shape.  We took binoculars and it was surronded by 6 white lights and one large orange light in the center.  Then it disappeared out of thin air. We called the ranger station afterward to see if anyone saw what the both of us did, however none of them went outside the biulding. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
