Suddenly the sky lit up in green and bluish flashes. They seemed to come from behind tall , distant buildings (office buildings of some sort). The entire sky lit ufor several seconds and we noticed there were no clouds in the sky, it was actually a rather clear and warm night. Nothing further happened after that.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
Craft speeding across the sky during a Dirty Job episode tonight.;2012-02-16 20:00:00;3 - 5 seconds;A craft speeding across the sky during a Dirty Job episode tonight. I was watching the latest episode of Dirty Jobs, Onion Processor Oxnard CA. tonight. In the very beginning when Mike Rowe was walking in front of the Storage bins a UFO flew across the screen from left to right.  I have the show recorded and watched it several times. Please check it out and tell me what you think ((NUFORC Note:  We do not have a copy of the footage, so we are unable to view it.  PD));34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
Strange bright light over neighborhood area;2015-08-11 23:56:00;3 seconds;Strange bright light over neighborhood area I stepped outside through my garage (I live in an apartment, so the garage leads to the back into a parking lot) to check if my cat was around, when I look to the left, I see a really bright flash moving super fast to the left through the nightsky into nothing. Just like a shooting star, but it seemed a whole lot bigger and as if it went from one door to another through the sky. It appeared, moved really fast throught the sky, maybe an inch or two from my distance, then disappeared.  This only lasted about 2-3 seconds and I couldn't really make a shape out of it, it just seemed like when somebody moves a light really fast in complete darkness, the way it draggs to the way they move it, except it vanished instantly shortly after I had seen it. I then waited in case I would see something else, but unfortunately that was the end of it.  This occurred around 23:56 on August 11th, 2015.  I had not checked the time, had it occurred to me, I would have.  My brother had yelled to me from inside, that is when I checked the time and it was 23:58, so I assume it was a few minutes before that. I am not in any way making any of this up, it is for whomever reads this to decide what they think of it. I simply couldn't make any logical explanation out of it, it surely could not have been a plane due to the size, speed and brightness of it.   In the end, it could be my brain playing tricks on me, but I truly don't think that.;34.2093746799432;-119.178581507823
