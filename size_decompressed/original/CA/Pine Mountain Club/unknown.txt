While sitting on my deck, talking on the phone, something caught my attention and I looked into the night sky almost directly above my head.  I saw a big circular light, bright, but not lighting up the sky.  As I watched, the light shrank then went out.  I could still make out a small object light, not flashing like on an airplane, but a solid light making its way through the sky.  It, whatever it was, was visible to the naked eye until it disappeared into the sky.  It didn't disappear due the terrain, but like it just disappeared into the heavens.  I have no idea what it was, there was no sound of any kind associated with the light.;34.8494;-119.152
