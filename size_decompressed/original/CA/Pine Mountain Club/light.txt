On the evening of October 5th, (I am not sure of the time as we had no clock) my wife and I saw a very bright light flare up, far brighter than any stars, Venus, or Jupiter, out of nowhere, due North of us.  It remained quite bright for perhaps 30 seconds, then it dissipated, and disappeared. First thought was a star going nova, but probably not bright enough, or long enough, and just not likely at all.  There are no stars in the position we saw this, also.  I checked Vandenberg AFBs launch schedule and nothing was scheduled, also the directions of the launches from us is about 70 degrees to the west, so also quite unlikely.  My best guess is that it was a meteorite/fireball with a trajectory of zero from our position, making it look absolutely motionless, coming, basically, directly at us. Other possibility might be a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit, which had not yet passed the terminator.  We see a large number of strange things up here (mostly military) but I am at a bit of a loss on this one.;34.8494;-119.152
