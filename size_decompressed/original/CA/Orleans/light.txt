It was about 10:00 p.m. and there were about a dozen of us there.  I was facing northeast when I noticed what appeared to be several satellites moving through the sky from different directions.  As they moved closer to each other, I became aware that there were 4 of these lights.  I really did not think much of it until the lights moved even closer to each other and then began circling around each other, as if they were moving in formation.  I’ve never seen satellites do this, but shrugged it off.   Then they all suddenly simultaneously streaked across the night sky at speeds I’ve never seen before, once again in totally different directions.  They did not make any discernible sounds. They moved so fast they were out of sight within a second.  Two of my friends and I jumped up at the s! ame time shouting “oh my god, did you see that?!”  It was as if they had moved at the speed of light!  To this day, I have never heard of any known flying object that can move at such speeds.;41.3115;-123.5399
