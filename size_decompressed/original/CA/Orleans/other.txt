Multiple wittness of multiple bright fuselage objects close and moving slow and low.;2012-07-20 14:45:00;4 hours +;Multiple wittness of multiple bright fuselage objects close and moving slow and low. Three of us observed unusual objects in sky.  All of us live in the area and have never seen objects like this.  We were in a drift boat on the KLAMATH RIVER.  The view of the sky was very large.  Objects were moving North and South.  They were white and long.  They were moving low and slow.  At least one disappeared behind mountains and reappeared.  They seemed to return or be replaced by other objects.  They were very bright white appearing to be reflecting sunlight not self luminous. There was no sound  We could hear.  There was background noise in the boat so there could have been noise.  Four or five cycles of objects were seen.  During one cycle a northbound object came close to a southbound object.  The southbound object had a contrail. No contrails were observed on the northbound objects.  A vague estimate of distance would be under 12 miles.  Later in the afternoon around 18:00 hours a southbound object was seen with a contrail.  The contrail disappeared.  A this point I was able to photograph with a digital camera with a 12 power telephoto lens.  It appears like a fuselage with a possible wing near the center. I have not blown up the photo on computer yet. Sightings of black silhouetted birds were also seen. In My opinion these objects could have been drones in test mode.  The did not execute any unusual behavior other than they were slow and low. They moved in straight lines The three observers are local and spend a lot of time outside.  Two were Indians. We all agreed these were unusual objects and We have never seen anything similar. THANKS for Your interest;41.3115;-123.5399
