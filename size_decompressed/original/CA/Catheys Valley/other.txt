At 6:10 this morning after arriving at work my boss alerted myself and a co employee to a VERY LARGE, very bright, shining object high in the eastern sky.The sun wasn't up yet but it was very light out. The ufo seemed to be slowly falling. It was rounded at the bottom, and had contrails at the top. Almost straight sided. It took 5 minutes to decend and dissapear behind the horizon (the Sierra mntns., Yosemite National Park)We were reminded of the space shuttle disaster. Another theory was a falling satalite. But it was much to large. Later in the day a truck driver stopped by that had seen the same thing at the same time while heading east on hwy 140 from Merced, Ca. to Mariposa.;37.4404;-120.1438
