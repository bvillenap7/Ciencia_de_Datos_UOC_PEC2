meteor like object;2001-09-11 22:00:00;30 seconds;meteor like object The night of the sept 11th disasters, i went outside to verify that there were no aircraft flying.  I saw a bright round light high in the sky above me.  I thought it was a meteor at first.  It was speeding in my direction when it stopped above me still high in the sky & hung there for a second then sped off to the south.  I have seen many meteors & it was the same brightness.  I had the eerie feeling it was reading me when it stopped for that second.;38.6439;-120.9636
