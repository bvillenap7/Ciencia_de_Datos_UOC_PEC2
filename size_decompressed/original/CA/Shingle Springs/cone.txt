Silver shape travelling at great speed;2010-09-29 20:32:00;2-3 sec.;Silver shape travelling at great speed As I was sitting on my patio observing the stars, I was surprised by an object that at first looked to me like an aircraft flying at a low altitude (my initial guess was something like 5000 ft) on fire going from north to south. However, after I realized that it had traversed from approx. 20 degrees above the north horizon to approx. 20 degrees above the south in about 3 seconds, I decided that it must be something else. It was silver color (not red- orange) somewhat a triangular shape about the width of two fingers at arms length and twice as long with streaming to the rear.;38.6439;-120.9636
