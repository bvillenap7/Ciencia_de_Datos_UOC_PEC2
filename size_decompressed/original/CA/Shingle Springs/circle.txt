Large planet like object in southwest sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  PD));2005-11-09 18:00:00;hours;Large planet like object in southwest sky. I assumed that what we were seeing was the Space Station, but I can't find any info so far on its orbital patterns or how large it appears in the sky.   This is a very large object that looks like a huge star but it isn't quite round.  It is in the south southwest most nights for the last month or so.  It is not always in the same exact place and some nights it seems to set.  I have even seen it before sunset as it is so bright.   My son and one of his friends sat outside and watched it late one night and said they saw two smaller round objects of light go up to it from the earth in basically a second or two.  They assumed they were some kind of advanced aircraft rendezvousing with the space station.  It also will turn off and on, we assumed they were turning the solar power panels or something and the reflected light was no longer coming our way.  Now since doing an internet search I'm not sure what this thing is.  Has anyone else seen it and been able to identify what it is?  I'd really like to hear from someone on this.  Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  The witnesses have been observing the planet, Venus, which currently can be seen in the southwestern sky during the early evening hours.  We include the report here, hoping to alert others to its presence, and hoping that others will be able to properly identify the object.  Although the International Space Station has an appearance, when viewed from ground level, which is similar to that of Venus, the ISS is traveling at approximately 18,000 mph, and is not seen to hover motionless in the night sky.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.6439;-120.9636
