My grandson,who is five, called us outside to see the UFO.  He has witnessed others with us before. My daughter and myself went outside to see and at first it looked like a jet with a stream coming off it.  We said that it was a jet and my grandson said that no it was not, that it was taking its tail with it.  We looked again.  It was moving horizontally very fast across the sky with no jet noise.  It was luminous, yellowish and very bright.  It was roundish in the front and then had like a long tail coming off and tapering down to very small.  Kind of like a sperm shape.  It looked like one thing and never changed its length or shape.  Where it tapered I could see waves of energy moving in it.  It was very beautiful looking.  It appeared out of nowhere in the east and moved across the sky under the sun to the west and then went down behind the mountains.  On 8-28-00 on the way to Calistoga my husband and I saw what appeared to be the same thing in the sky but it was higher up and further away and we were driving and didn't get that good of a look at it.  It too though was not changing its length or shape. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed on these two nights.  We recommend that witnesses, when they see something unusual, stop their car and either get out of the vehicle, or open its windows, to view an unusual object.  Being stationary helps the witness establish whether the object is moving, or stationary.  Also, glass can distort the appearance of an object.  These witnesses may have done that.
