Bright light, about midway between the brightness of Jupiter and Venus appeared in the constellation of Orion while I was observing the Great Nebula. It was very white and bright. It's direction was Northerly toward the constellation Leo and it was about 35 degrees above the horizon. The light had no aircraft lights, no blinking light such as military aircraft have when I notice their aircraft passing over where I live. The craft was proceeding fairly rapidly, taking only about two minutes to go from Orion to Leo. Then the object was much lower on the horizon and seemed to turn due East and in a few seconds  the light disappeared. I ran to my house to get my binoculars, as my telescope was behind a fence and not in the line of sight of the object, but I could not find a pair fast enough, and I did not want to miss the sighting, so I watched unaided as best I could, and saw the light, as I said, disappear in the East. Aircraft I have seen in my lifetime, flyi! ng at night, have blinking lights and do not have the luminosity that this object had, and it was a steady,bright light, not changing, except at the last seconds as it disappeared in the East, in the first, faint traces of the Suns earliest glow.;38.7844;-122.6445
