While driving home from shopping, I saw an bright glowing white object. It was like seeing a bright, white florescent light tube flying smoothly in a steady path from south to north at approximately 2000 ft altitude. I'd estimate it was approximatly 60 ft in length and about 15 ft diameter and it was cylinderical/cigar shaped. It was not moving very fast, approximately 100 to 200 mph and it was completely silent. It was heading in my general direction from the  south west. As it got closer I noticed a slight trail of smoke behind it but heard no engine sounds and observed no flames or anything else to accound for the smoke trail. The smoke trail made me think that someone might be playing a prank and sent up a small rocket with a light tube inside it. However, I observed no wings and it moved horizontally at a constant velocity and was not falling or descending as a rocket normally would without any propulsion. So I dismissed the prank-rocket and was left not knowing what it was. There were no marker lights, windows or any other lights aircraft normally have.   While driving south, I watched it through my windshield for about 1/2 minute as it got closer. Then I turned off highway 29 at the Dry Creek Exit to better observe it and to make sure I don't pass it. I watched it for a few more seconds and then I realized that I better park the car safely off the road to avoid someone rear ending my car. I took my eyes off it for just a few seconds to park off the road and get out of the car and when I looked up again it was gone.  All that was left was a thin trail of smoke that ended abruptly where I last observed it.;38.7844;-122.6445
