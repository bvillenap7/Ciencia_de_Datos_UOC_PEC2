The object was moving from a mountain to the north, was rotating at approx 20 rotations per min and flying south at aprox 15mph at about 200 ft above ground level, dead silent.  This object was then followed up about 5 min later by another object with exactly the same flight path and appearance, following this second object every min there came a new object until we counted 13 objects that had passed by us and nearly all where still in view following each-other flawlessly.;38.7844;-122.6445
