A bright white light lit up the dark back street I was using to get back home.;2014-08-28 22:28:00;1 second;I was walking back home from the local market at about 10:25 or so listening to my iPhone and selecting a song to listen to so my attention was directed towards the ground naturally looking into my device, when all of a sudden a bright white light lit up the dark back street I was using to get back home which I use frequently,I was suddenly lit up with a bright white light through out the neighbor hood and valley,   I was startled of course so I looked everywhere and up to see a rocket like figure almost like a space ship, human of course, like the Apollo darting across the sky, but very bright and white, and much larger, it lasted only a half a second,   I don't believe it's alien but extraordinary, living in this area we have many mililltary bases near by including china lake so I'm used to it but ((deleted)) it was cool!!
