As my mom was driving us home south on Powerline rd, off to our right over Olivehurst she spotted something that was different. After turning a corner she got a better view of the object and pointed it out to my brother and I. It was just sitting still hovering over houses. We wanted to get a better look at it so we started towards it. It then began to fly off to the right very fast, so fast that we could not catch up to it. We lost it. It was very large, we could not see the exact shape, but we could see the out line of a large black mass. It had bright red lights lit up in a line curving around the left side. My mom had a better angle than me and she saw white lights lining the lower part of it. We live near both an airport and a very active air force base, but it looked like nothing we had ever seen before.;39.0854;-121.5444
