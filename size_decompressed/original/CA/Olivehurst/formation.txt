Triangle of lights;2010-11-18 17:30:00;5-7 min;Triangle of lights A friend and I were eating at a Taco stand in Olivehurst,Ca last night roughly around 5:30 p.m.  It started out as a triangle of three lights than spun around in a circle.   A couple minutes later one light took off fast to the left while the other two sped off to the right. They shot across the sky so fast that they we knew they couldn't have been airplanes.  The lights were multi-colored. I could not tell what shape they.   One of the observers is a non-believer of extraterrestrial life,and nor does he care. He is a plant manager. I am a student and stay at home mother.  Neither one of us has any mental illnesses and are both have to see it to believe it people.   We were both stunned by what we saw and have never seen anything like it ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.0854;-121.5444
