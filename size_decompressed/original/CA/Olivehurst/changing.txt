2 Sightings in one day.;2012-11-18 18:00:00;2 minutes;2 Sightings in one day Driving southbound to go home my husband and I saw a weird shape in the sky during daylight. It appeared translucent and we had thought it might have been a plastic bag at first.  It then was a lot bigger with a round shape but as it started going off in the distance looked like it changed shape. Later that night we had seen a large object that appeared like it was touching down with large red flashing lights.  Our attention was on this triangle shaped object that we failed to notice the hovering, identical craft right above it.  We only saw this long enough for us to get on the exit and it disappeared.;39.0854;-121.5444
