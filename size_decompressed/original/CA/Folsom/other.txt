two hawk shaped objects paceing small jet at high alt. and speed;2006-03-11 12:00:00;60seconds;two hawk shaped objects paceing small jet at high alt. and speed I was driving and when came to a stop light I looked out of my open window up into the semi puffy wierd cloudy crystal clear blue sky of which i have a slight habit of doing , quite frankly i observe the skys every day, so to say i have a keen eye like a hawk again my sight is highly trained and practiced. well,I quickly spoted a small leer jet type plane at 11:00 position headed north east at about 20,000 ft. just above the cloud level. I was observing the plane mainly for a con-chemtral when i noticed just behind the plane on both ends of the wings of the plane where to hawk shaped objects paceing the plane they where both the same distance behind the plane about a thumbnail length but seemed to be just higher then plane they looked like two souring hawk at high altitude but they flew at the exact same speed as the plane, they and the jet plane flew  pretty much right over my head and off to the north going extremely fast I just kept looking and looking saying to myself no no no hawks dont fly at the same speed and hieght of a jet air plane I have been perplexed ever since that bazarre event oh every one in traffic was laughing at me as i pulled myself back through my car window ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.

Object spotted overhead moving quickly from east to west with three linear non-flashing lights.;2014-11-14 22:20:00;15 seconds;Object spotted overhead moving quickly from east to west with three linear non flashing lights. Enjoying the hot tub with my wife looking up into the very clear night sky and witnessed a moving object never seen before.  It had three non-flashing evenly spaced lights in a linear formation moving quickly from east to west.   There was no sound emitted and could not judge the elevation of the object but it was moving quicker than any normal plane would.   Observers are 40 and 50 and would like to think this was not a drone or something similar.;38.6711989690722;-121.1498
