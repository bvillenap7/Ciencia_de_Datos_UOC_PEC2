Craft visible by 2 very bright lights and high speed 45 degree angle to earth disappears;2016-04-02 22:30:00;5-10 seconds;Craft visible by 2 very bright lights and high speed 45 degree angle to earth disappears My friend and I were coming home it was around 10:30p.  Weâ€™re driving along and out her front windshield we see what we thought was a shooting star come into view going left to right, but it lasted too long and is was too bright and going extremely fast.  It was shooting down at a steep angle, 45 degrees.  Then I can see 2 lights on it not just 1 and realize it's not a shooting star but a plane or something that is going to crash.  Then it disappeared in less than a second.   There were no clouds in the sky infact there were stars out.;38.6711989690722;-121.1498
