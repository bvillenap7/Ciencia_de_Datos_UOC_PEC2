Triangular shape over Folsom, CA;2002-04-19 23:06:00;10 seconds;Triangular shape over Folsom, CA The object was witnessed by 3 people who have never seen anything like this before, or made any such report. Male age 52, son age 18, female age 50. All three of us wrote down our observations independently and they are almost completely identical. Object was observed almost directly overhead, moving roughly northwest. It was a triangular shape, with softly glowing orange tips on all three points. The outline appeared to be faintly lit as well. I would guess its' altitude to have been at least several thousand feet. It moved steadily in a straight line until it was blocked by the roof of the house. There was absolutely no sound we could discern.;38.6711989690722;-121.1498
I saw a large triangular craft with three large white lights on the tips and dimmer light in the center.;2002-12-05 19:45:00;5 min ?;I saw a large triangular craft with three large white lights on the tips and dimmer light in the center. I saw a bright light in the night sky as I approached Scott Rd (Folsom, CA) to the right. I thought it was a helicopter hovering as they do sometimes watching the traffic. I was headed eastbound on Hwy 50 and as I proceeded it became obvious that the craft wasn't a helicopter because it was much too big and far away. As I got closer to it, it was evident that it had three lights and as I passed near the Cambridge Rd. exit, it was now on the right hand side of the freeway and you could see under it and it was triangular, had three large white lights on the tips of the triangles and a dimmer light in the center, with some smaller little lights around it.;38.6711989690722;-121.1498
black government triangular shape hovering above Hwy 50 in Sacramento;2006-01-17 18:00:00;5 minutes;black government triangular shape hovering above Hwy 50 in Sacramento The craft was triangular in shape and appeared to have three lights fixed at each angle.  It was hovering at a stand still over Highway 50 just above the tree line of some large native pine trees and looked to be 2 yards length from the ground.  I could'nt believe my eyes as we drove by it and noticed no blinking lights that would portray a personal/commercial aircraft.  If I were to guess, it looked to be a one of ours due to the engineering aspest of the craft.  I've spotted E.T UFO's in the past but, this one was somewhat rustic in nature. I say this because there was no discoloration from the lights at the bottom of the triangle it just shined a yellowish/white light.  I should of pulled over to get a closer look however, circumstances and traffic didn't allow it.  I also forgot to mention that after sighting the object some of the street lights blacked out as it appeared there was a energy force within the area.;38.6711989690722;-121.1498
A bright orange boomerang shaped object disappeared into the sky leaving a distinct blue tail.;2014-08-28 22:30:00;2 seconds;A bright Orange boomerang shaped object disappeared into the sky leaving a distinct blue tail.   The colors were distinct and separate, the trail was bright and sharp, it wasn't a glow, just bright.  Like nothing I've ever seen.  It didn't trail down but more so looked like it went off into the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.6711989690722;-121.1498
V-shaped object with no lights moving silently over the town of Folsom.;2017-11-10 22:45:00;10 seconds;V-shaped object with no lights moving Silently over the town of Folsom. On November 10th, at approximately  22:45 hours, I was looking up into the night sky, while talking to someone who was in a elevated position.  As I was talking to them, I noticed a dark shadow move over their head.  I focused my attention into the object and observed a large triangle object, moving in a southernly direction.  The object was approximately 2500 feet about the ground moving at a slow pace.  The object had no lights or markings and was about the size of a football field and blended into the night sky.  The area I was standing in was lit up with powerful night time lighting and the light was reflecting off the metal material of the object.  As I watched the object it was moving in a slow manner in a southernly direction.  The thing that was the most amazing was that the object made no sound at all.
