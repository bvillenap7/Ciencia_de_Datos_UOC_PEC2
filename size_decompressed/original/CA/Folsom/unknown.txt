Four white objects in formation over Folsom, CA;2011-07-19 11:40:00;3 min;Four white objects in formation over Folsom, CA   They were white and looked like large birds lazily gliding - but the perfect formation was never broken.   While I watched, I saw an odd, experimental looking airplane fly overhead, and by the time I looked back at the formation, they were gone. I drove back to work, studying the sky and saw two objects, maybe aircraft, flying low on the horizon at the same altitude. I couldn't see more than two, due to nearby trees.  Back at work, I saw nothing. The three objects in formation moved like aircraft in an air show, but their speed seemed too slow to be planes - and the formation was too perfect to be birds, though they seemed to fly like gliding birds.   I wish I had binoculars. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));38.6711989690722;-121.1498
