Orange light seen.;2017-02-27 18:11:00;30-60 seconds;Orange light seen. I was driving east bound Highway 50 just before sunset, to my 10'oclock I noticed an orange light about 30 deg above horizon.  It seemed odd to me due to the color of the light being orange.  I noticed that there was a dark spherical object that the light was on.  I thought it may have been a helicopter or plane since it was near the flight path for Mather Field.  There were no FAA lights on the object.   As the object came closer I kept looking to see if it was a helicopter, but still looked spherical as it passed over me.  It seemed to be flying in the direction of Mather Field from the area of the Intel building in Folsom. The lights were orange and I could not see any green, red or strobe lights that would indicate FAA regulated lights.  I saw no wings or propellers.  The object stayed spherical in shape. Please feel free to contact me if needed.;38.6711989690722;-121.1498
