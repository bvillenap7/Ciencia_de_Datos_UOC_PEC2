White cylinder craft dissapears and reappears right above us on Folsom lake in CA. 5 witnesses;2005-08-24 19:00:00;5 min;White cylinder craft dissapears and reappears right above us on Folsom lake in CA. 5 witnesses There was a group of 5 people wakebarding on Folsom lake around 7 o'clock on Wedensday the 24th.  Our boat was travelling parralell next to the Folsom dam.    Above the damn we saw a white cylindrical object in the sky.  It appeared still at first then slowly moved away from the dam.  In no way did it appear to be a plane.   It was in the sky for a good minute when our friend fell down in the water, and we took our eyes of the craft for no more than 5 seconds. Then we look back and it had dissapeared.  Before we had turned away it was a fairly close distance and no plane could have dissapeared that fast from how close it was to us.  This day there were absolutely no clouds in the sky.  10 min later on the way back to the dock, we were all scanning the skys when suddenly the same craft was directly above us!  It had appeared there in practically an instant. Then it moved toward the damn at a faster speed.  We eventually lost sight of the craft until it was too far.  We also saw a helicopter in the area that appeared to be head in the direction of the craft.  We also saw plenty of passenger planes that were instanly identifiable as planes.  This craft shared no resemblence.  None of the plane were moving at the speed of the craft.;38.6711989690722;-121.1498
