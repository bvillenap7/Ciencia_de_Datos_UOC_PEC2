Extremely fast, bright light flies then disapears;2008-05-16 21:45:00;15 seconds;Extremely fast, bright light flies then disapears I was taking the trash out from my job around 9:45 at night, when a bright circle-like object flew above me.  It was going very,very fast.  Then, all of the sudden, it stopped in mid-air and hovered there.  It zipped to the right at an extremely fast speed, which i've never seen any other flying object do!.  It hovered again to my right.  Then, it just went blank.  The light literally just went invisible or teleported.  There was nothing there.  It vanished in the sky.  It didn't fly somewhere, but just went blank.  As soon as i saw it, four car alarms next to me went off!  There were no people so i found it strange that it did that.;38.6711989690722;-121.1498
A bright, big circular object over Folsom, California;2008-07-09 22:15:00;30 seconds;A bright, big circular object over Folsom, California I was taking out the trash at my job when i looked up in the sky and saw a very bright circular flying object.  It was very close to the ground to be a plane and was moving at speeds that were unthinkable.  It was brighter than a full moon and about half the size.  It flew over me then stopped in mid-air.  It waited for 15 seconds, then abruptly moved very fast to the left.  It floated for another 10 seconds and then miraculously the light when dark.  It vanished just like that. -Another thing i found odd was i was in a back parking lot with only two cars in it and when the object disappeared both of the car alarms went off without any outside interference.;38.6711989690722;-121.1498

I've been watching crafts with multi-color lights pose in the sky as stars through my telescope since November of 08 every night.;2015-01-07 01:00:00;until sunrise;I've been watching crafts with multi-color lights pose in the sky as stars through my telescope since November of 08 every night. Since November 16th of 2008 I've been watching objects in the sky pose a stars is what it seems.  During the same time each night, these objects it seems turn multi color light on which are blue, green, and red and it zig zags and dances around.  There is one red light that is on top of all of these objects and looking through a telescope and binoculars it would seem that these so called stars are in our airspace.  If its a clear night I can show anyone who would like to see them.  The best time is between 7:00-8:45 PM is when the lights are on.   Again, I've been watching these objects every night since 11/16/08.  On 11/22/08 a News 10 Sacramento helicopter was covering a high school foot game and try to get close to one of these objects and it got further and further away from the helicopter.   It was since explained a few days later that it was an airplane with lights doing advertising which is not the case.  I went online and the video of the helicopter chasing this object has been removed from every site it was on and only a still picture of what they chased is there.;38.6711989690722;-121.1498
