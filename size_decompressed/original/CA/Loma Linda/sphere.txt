Sphere creating light all around it changing size and shape when it moved.;2003-08-15 03:45:00;15 min.;Sphere creating light all around it changing size and shape when it moved. I had to leave early in the morning, around 3:45 AM, for work and I spotted a bright pulsing light comming from the South East over the canyon.  The object changed color very rapidly, and changed size with every burst of color. This object did not have lights on it, it created light all around it.  When this object moved it change into a bow tie shape.  This object was strange enough for me to want to video tape it so I did.  The tape is about 5-7 min long.
