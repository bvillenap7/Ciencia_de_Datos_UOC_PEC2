It was in sight when I went outside,  Due east from the Ca. coast, possibly as far away as over the Sierras.  It was twinkling, a bit like a christmas tree, in red, blue, green and white.  I watched it for about 30 seconds, and then it just disappeared.  I initially thought it might be a plane, or possibly the I.S.S., but they don't typically have that shape, that brilliance, and don't just blank out like a candle that's been blown out.;39.4395;-123.7683
