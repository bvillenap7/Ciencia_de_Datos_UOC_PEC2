4 glowing orange lights spotted in northern sky above Fort Bragg, California.;2015-01-03 22:20:00;10 minutes;4 glowing orange lights spotted in northern sky above Fort Bragg California Walked outside with girlfriend as she was going to work.  Spotted a single light in the north sky and remarked on it - she said it was airplane.  I said that glows different and there are no green and red lights marking lights - just a orange glow, unlike airplanes.  We watched as 2 more joined it, and I said getting camera, ran inside, came out and she said there is a 4th light, I started filming as we talked, but only seemed to capture street lights.   The other 3 lights seemed to start to go up into the low clouds after 5 minutes or so, as the first light started flickering as it appeared to disappear into the low clouds as well about a minute after the other 3 lights vanished.  No sound heard by either of us.;39.4395;-123.7683
