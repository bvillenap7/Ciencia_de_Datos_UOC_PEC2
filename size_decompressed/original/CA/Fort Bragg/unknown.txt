Two craft with white and red lights sighted over Fort Bragg, CA;2015-04-11 20:45:00;15 minutes;Two craft with white and red lights sighted over Fort Bragg, CA Fort Bragg, California.  4/11/2015 8:45 PM   Cloudless, very dark with crystal clear clarity…… I glanced outside my door about 8:45 PM and saw two craft in the north and northeast sky with unusual lights.  They each appeared to have two white and two red lights, all of which were steady, not pulsing.  The craft were moving about fairly quickly, to and fro, left and right, up and down, getting quite close to each other at one point.  There was no noise, as from a helicopter. I estimate the altitude varied from a maximum of 500 feet to a minimum of 100 feet when they dropped below the tree line, possible lower as I could no longer see them.  They did not disappear behind the trees because they were receding, but rather because they were dropping. I estimate their distance at no more than ¾ mile. I opened my car trunk and got out my binoculars but couldn’t see a craft body, just the lights.  The lights maintained the same perspective regardless of the direction of movement of the craft.  On one the white lights remained orientated to the west and the red to the east, while the other seemed to do the same, with the direction orientated more north-south when that craft was to the east. I finally grabbed my camera, a Canon Powershot, and managed to get a little bit of footage of one of them.  I wish it had a better zoom lens.   I thought I got the other one, and have a video clip, but I can’t see anything in that clip.;39.4395;-123.7683
