The two silver and gold colored vehicles approached on two divergent paths, then the one closest to land, changed it's coarse, and flew parallel to the other one. We observed them from The Boatyard, however a friend saw it from Glass Beach, also. It hovered for two minutes, then one flew off towards the southwest. The second one followed about one  minute later. While hovering they looked trianglar and silver. This is my second sighting in nine years.;39.4395;-123.7683
