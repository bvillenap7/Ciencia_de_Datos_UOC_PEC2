5 orange orbs seen over Northern California coast March 31, 2013.;2013-03-31 21:00:00;5-10 minutes;5 orange orbs seen over Northern California coast March 31, 2013 I was making a food delivery to a house.  As I was coming up the street (heading north) an orange orb in the sky.  Simply, it looked like a fire ball that faded in an out, but moved at a very slow speed (appeared to be decending...and headed in a south westerly direction).  I made the delivery to the customer, and told them to come and see what I was seeing in the sky.   Another orange orb appeared, then another, and yet another. I returned to work, and was telling my co-workers about it.  A fellow co-worker and I were standing outside, when yet another appeared, and we both saw that orange orb together. This was not the first time, for me, with seeing orange orbs.  I saw them on New Years Eve (January 2013--right after mid-night) as well, with a group of about 9 friends.  We saw a total of 4 that evening.  The orange orbs during the New Years Eve sighting, were moving north easterly, and appeared to be ascending.  peace.;39.4395;-123.7683
