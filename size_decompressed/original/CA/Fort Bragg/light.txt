5 lights hovering over Fort Bragg, CA.;2015-01-03 22:05:00;5 minutes;5 lights hovering over Fort Bragg, Ca At first I thought it was an airplane, until the others had shown up.  My boyfriend was the first to notice the first one.  It was red in color with bits of green.  So where the others, and they varied in size.   They came from the north traveling southwards.  It seemed like the other ones where following the first ones?  Then they hovered in the sky for a moment, then slowly one by one they dissipated into the clouds.   I don't know what they where, I am hoping they where lanterns or something.  I really so not even believe in this stuff.  I mean, I do believe that there are other planets they may have life on them, but I never believed in the whole UFO/alien thing.   I just moved here about 6 months or so ago.  I never seen anything like this. I don't know what else to put.  I am just really freaked out.  Even my cat, ((name deleted)), was freaking out.  I don't know what to think.   I tried to video record it, but I don't think it worked.  I think the only thing showing up is the street lights below?;39.4395;-123.7683
