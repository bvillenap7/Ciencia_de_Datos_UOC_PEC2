smooth shiny silver metal craft;2008-07-05 14:00:00;2 seconds;I looked up and saw the side of a smooth shiny silver metal craft when the sun gave a glare to the craft. It was in between the fog. There was no sound. The fog broke up and there was nothing to see anymore.  It was really quick. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

When I looked up I could not believe what I was seeing. Two disk-like objects both had two one large circle of yellow lights around the rim of the disks and one smaller circle of lights in the middle of the large circle. The objects were moving very fast and appeared to be not too high up in the sky. It looked like the two disks were attached to a large object because they kept rotating in a similar manner, circling each other. They were fast so I didn't have a chance to grab my photo camera and take a picture.;37.6837833333333;-122.465841666667
