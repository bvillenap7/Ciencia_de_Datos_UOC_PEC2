Object has been in the area for 2 evenings and moves back and forth over the montain.  ((NUFORC Note:  Celestial body??  PD));2004-02-12 17:00:00;All Night;((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at a celestial body.  PD)) Object has been in the area for 2 evenings and moves back and forth over the montain. Craft hovers about 500 feet off the ground.  Moves very slowly back and forth. Has about the same movment as a ballon in a very light wind. It has been up in the sky in the same area for the past 2 evenings. It moves across the sky all night and into the early morning. The intensity of the light never changes in day light. I observed it from early yesterday evening, went to sleep, woke up at 5am and it was still up in the sky. Always slight movment that is very irratic. You can still see it right now and bet for the rest of the evening. It is at the top of the montain that has the 'Welcome to South San Francisco' sign on it. Like the hollyood sign. There is a large radio tower up there, but this craft/light is no where near it.;37.6837833333333;-122.465841666667
Blinking light moving in different directions;2005-03-11 00:35:00;10;Blinking light moving in different directions, thus could not be any aircraft we have in our world. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));37.6837833333333;-122.465841666667
I was driving and saw this strange object in the dark sky moving very fast, making complete stops, changing directions in sharp angles.;2013-12-13 17:50:00;3 minutes;I was driving and saw this strange object in the dark sky moving very fast, making complete stops, changing directions in sharp angles.  We have a SF International Airport in a couple of miles from this spot.  Several aircrafts were in the sky at the time and comparing to them this object was moving absolutely differently at about the same altitude.  I was watching it for some time at the red light but then I had to move and could not see it any more. The object looked like a bunch of red lights and one green was blinking. Most of all it reminded me of a child toy but very high in the sky.  Was it some kind of a drone?;37.6837833333333;-122.465841666667
I stepped outside, & saw a light move faster than any satellite I've ever seen move east to west under the moon and disappear.;2020-03-03 22:28:00;5 seconds;I stepped outside, & saw a light move faster than any satellite I've ever seen move east to west under the moon and disappear. I stepped outside to take a smoke.  My eyes immediately were drawn to a light high in the sky, moving very swiftly to the west,  just under the moon.  At first, I thought it was a satellite, but it moved much faster than any satellite I've ever seen.   & every satellite I've ever seen would continue to stay in vision.  However, even though the area I was looking at was clear of clouds, it disappeared.  It looked like it was going up into the atmosphere, not in orbit.  It was by far the fastest thing I've ever seen move in the sky, with the exception of shooting stars & the fireball I witnessed for 3-4 seconds fall & break into pieces just recently (2/25/20, in the northwestern sky).  I'd estimate that I saw it zip by for about 5 seconds.;37.6837833333333;-122.465841666667
Small bring lights high above horizon, midday;2020-05-26 13:00:00;20 minutes;Small bring lights high above horizon, midday Looking west, approximately 60 degrees above horizon, one bright light that varied in brightness. Size wise, imagine holding a BB at armâ€™s length. Moved slowly left to right, stopped, three other dimmer lights appeared, vanished, reappeared over several minutes. Stepped indoors for 30 minutes, when I stepped outside lights not visible.;37.6837833333333;-122.465841666667
