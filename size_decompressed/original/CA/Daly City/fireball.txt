Fireball appeared for 5 seconds;2006-03-12 18:00:00;5 - 10 seconds;Fireball appeared for 5 seconds I was taking a picture of the moon in that evening and everything was normal while I was holding my camera and trying to focus my picture.  However, just about a couple seconds before I was ready to press the capture button, I suddenly saw a fireball showing up on my digital camera's screen and I looked at it staying still above the moon for about 5 to 10 seconds and I immmediately captured it before it disappeared immediately after I pressed the button.   At the first place, I thought it was a reflection of the moon, but I immediately took one more picture of the moon after this one and discovered that everything was normal again.

I thought at first glance it was a plane. Then, noticing clearly, it was a fireball.  ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor??  PD));2015-11-11 18:26:00;4;When noticing a flash to my right of my windshield, I thought at first glance it was a plane. Then, noticing clearly, it was a fireball falling from the sky toward the Pacific ocean.  Things broke apart from it and disappeared.

A big, bright fireball streaked across the sky for about 3-4 seconds, and then broke up into pieces. ((anonymous));2020-02-25 23:21:00;3-4 seconds;A big, bright fireball streaked across the sky for about 3-4 seconds, and then broke up into pieces before disappearing. I happened to be looking up at the sky, exactly where the streak of bright light started.  At first I thought it was a meteor, but it was much bigger, brighter, & it went on longer than a typical meteor (about 3-4 seconds).  & then it broke up into pieces, creating a long tail, before it disappeared.;37.6837833333333;-122.465841666667
