Bright silver star-like object hovering over San Mateo/San Francisco;2014-10-15 21:00:00;several hours;Bright silver star-like object hovering over San Mateo/San Francisco Each evening for three weeks I have observed a bright silver star like object rising from the west over the San Mateo County/San Francisco county line. It hovers and then over a period of one-four hours very slowly moves higher and higher and more easterly.   It has emitted a red light on two occasions. I showed my husband who said it was a planet or a satellite.  I don't think so at all.;37.6837833333333;-122.465841666667
