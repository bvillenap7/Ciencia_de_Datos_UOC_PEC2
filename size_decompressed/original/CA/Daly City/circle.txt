strange lights hovering and flying over San Francisco bay.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star?   Sirius??  PD));2007-01-15 01:45:00;1 hour;strange lights hovering and flying over San Francisco bay. I watched, what apeared to be a hovering helocopter, over the east bay mountains. what stuck me were the different color lights (Red, Blue, and Green) as I watched them soon they split apart and one of the set of lights headed west and out of visual range. Sharty after two more sets of lights flew under the stationary set, they set out in opposite directions west and east. It is now 2 am and the stationary set is still visable. I found a old pair of binoculars and was shock at the row of lights spinning around the craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star?   Sirius??  PD));37.6837833333333;-122.465841666667
