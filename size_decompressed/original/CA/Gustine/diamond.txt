8 elongated hexagon-shaped objects at high altitude in sky.;2014-09-19 18:50:00;30 minutes;8 elongated hexagon-shaped objects at high altitude in sky. 6:50 pm, September 19th, 2014.  My girlfriend and I, on route to San Francisco, stopped to use the Valero service station on Hwy 33 off Interstate 5.  Upon exiting our vehicle we noticed the attendant and a customer looking up in the sky to the West.  We looked up and noticed 8 objects at a high altitude fixed in the sky, like a constellation. There were no stars visible as it was still light out. The objects appeared to be angular in shape like an elongated hexagon.  The attendant told us that they had been visible for about 20 minutes already.  There was no sound audible. The objects did not move for the 30 or so minutes that we watched.  I cannot accurately estimate the size of the objects but an airliner flew over at one point and the objects were higher and larger than the airliner. As the daylight diminished, the objects grew less visible leading me to conclude that they were not emitting their own light but were illuminated by the sun, reflecting the sun that was already over the horizon.  The 8 objects were spread out over about 1/3 of the sky in front of us, 60 degrees high or so and about 60 degrees left to right.  As we watched, there were many other witnesses coming and going as they stopped to gas up. As the sun continued to set, the objects became less and less visible until we could no longer see them.  There was no way to tell if they were still there.;37.199;-121.0091
