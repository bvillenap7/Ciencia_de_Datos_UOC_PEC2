2 white disks spotted over central California during the day;2010-07-28 13:00:00;2 minutes;2 white disks spotted over central California during the day Wednesday, July 28, 2010, approximately 1pm PDT. Sky completely clear. Location: LAT 36.87, LONG. -120.78  I was driving northbound on Interstate 5 in central California.  I noticed two bright white disk-shaped objects, very close together, very distinctive as opaque objects, with a thin dark grey edge, meandering through the sky, sort of slowly circling each other but together moving swiftly southward down the valley.  They seemed about 2 miles up. No trails or glow, just two waferlike disc objects, not natural, not spherical.  These were definitely manufactured objects. They were not birds or balloons that is for sure. The edges of the two disks were crisp and defined, and there was no reflection, like it had a white matte finish.  No markings that I could see.  When I first looked I thought it could be two aircraft. But then I focused and realized these were round and the way they behaved together, sort of a figure 8 motion to each other as they moved collectively and rapidly through the air heading down the valley, I have never seen that before with aircraft. What were they?;37.199;-121.0091
