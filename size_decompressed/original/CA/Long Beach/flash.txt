Green Flash seen during Long Beach Black Out;2007-02-08 02:00:00;second;Green Flash seen during Long Beach Black Out there was a black out tonight around 2:00am on thursday february 8 (just right now). The only problem was that only one side of the city or street I don't really know was blacked out. But the other side had light. The weird part was when I opened my blinds to see outside, I saw this green light in the sky just flash. Sort of like a lightning bolt but faster. It was pretty weird. Nothing like I have seen before. I thought it might have something to do with the blackout. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

I know it was not lightening because the sky was very clear 10/14/15 night.   I went to work this morning and I noticed my co worker speaking about it and then my boss agreed to seeing those lights as well that night.   Not sure if anyone else noticed?;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
