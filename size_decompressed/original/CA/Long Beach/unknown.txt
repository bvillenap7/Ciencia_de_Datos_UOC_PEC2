Did not seems like a satellite or aircraft or other familiar man-made object.  Sky was clear and other natural bodies/stars were clearly visible at the time, and this strange star-like moving body considerably brighter than everything else in the sky.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

The sky was intermitinly clouded, mostly small clouds passing by. carried by a swift upper wind. at first I thought they were stars, but they were brighter than venus. then I thougth it was one airplane, but there were no flashing lights, then I noticed more of them too many to be airplanes. 50 to 60 all moving in the same direction from the eastern horizon to the west.  Some were in formations other were not.  There would be bursts of speed then very slow as if trying to pass for stars should anyone look up.  I had to ask others there if they were seeing what i was seeing and like me the first explanation was that they were planes, but the altitude was too high and their light to bright for anything conventional and the speed to great, not to mention the size they must have been to cast such a light at that altitude.  After they passed there was a brief period where the sky was just black then the stars! were all there in their normal  locations I stood there in disbelief while other said to call the police or someone.  Some of the women there even started to cry saying it was armegedon.  I just could not believe what I saw and so many and not one of our jets was in the sky?  I live near a flight path.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Loud cycling noise followed by multiple helicopters;2010-01-15 16:55:00;5 minutes +;Loud cycling noise followed by multiple helicopters I was just outside and heard a strange noise from above.  I looked up but could not see whatever was making the noise because of low clouds.  It sounded kind of like a car alarm but a lower pitch.  The noise was cycling and constant as it passed overhead and to the south.  Minutes after, I heard a helicopter pass overhead, then two more off in the distance to the east and a finally fourth coming from the north.  They formed up in a line abreast and began what seemed like a sweep in a northwest direction and turned southeast.  They are probably visible in the sky as I type this.  The helicopters have to be related to what I heard.  The only other time I saw so many helicopters was durning coverage of OJ Simpson in the Ford Bronco speeding down the 91 fwy.  They were media copters getting the scoop. Going to check the TV and see if there is a car chase or something.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

Flash was then kind of absorbed back into flying object.  A sphere-like bright white light ingolfed flying object then dim out and a bright lazer like blue/green flash of light came out of object that shortly after seemed to disappear in the distance.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

UFO releases over 30 Orbs.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-21 15:00:00;11 minutes;UFO releases over 30 Orbs. I saw a huge white orb over my house in Long Beach, CA, on October 21, 2017.  At first I spotted two objects crossing path's with each other then focused on the larger one.  As I zoomed in on my camera the UFO started ejecting smaller spheres into the atmosphere.    The first ejection formed a triangular formation!  As I kept filming the object started emitting tons of orbs falling in a steady stream from the main object.  There were at least 40 smaller spheres emitted from the main UFO.  Interestingly the smaller orbs were only visible through my infrared camera.  This was recorded with my full spectrum Canon SX60 with a monopod in my backyard in Long Beach CA. The first part of the video shows the raw footage and the analysis of the capture is presented in the end of the video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCldZk3oBWY&feature=youtu.be&t=1s ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
