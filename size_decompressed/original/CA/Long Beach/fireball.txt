We were in the vehicle on the 710 exiting willow when we saw a fireball in the sky.  It was the size of an economic automobile that hovered intuitively in the night sky above us.  Time seem to slow down and we managed to take 3 pictures of the craft.  The unidentified flying object would hover in the same spot for seconds at a time and navigated away from us.  It was sparkling object and it was ejecting sparks and the center omitted bright luminous gold's and red.  When looking at the photos that we have capture of this event the object appears to be white light projection.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
