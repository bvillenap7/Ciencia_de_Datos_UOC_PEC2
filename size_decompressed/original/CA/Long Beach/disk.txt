The objects made no sound, the direction was complete oppisite from the radiant of the meteor shower. I had my wife out by the next 5 minutes.As we talked and watched more meteors, she spoted the same orage thing moving at a very high rate of speed heading south when I caught it also, It looked the same but only as 1, until I looked harder it seemed it could have been 2 very close together, this sighting was only about 5-8 seconds with the speed of the object taking into the city muck again to the right of Jupiter about 15 degrees. THis night was clear, aircraft could be seen flying as normal, a few satellites as normal, and many meteors coming from the radiant. I have been an ametuer astronomer for some 25 yrs, and have never seen anything close to this or ANYTHING moving at that speed, not even when the shuttle lands here does it move that fast, even then the shuttle makes 2 loud bangs even at its slower speed.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
8 crystal clear crafts at Queen Mary;2002-10-19 01:30:00;4 Minutes;8 crystal clear crafts at Queen Mary 5 of my friends and I were just leaving an event held at the Queen Mary ship. We all noticed them at the same time, crystal clear, I'd say aprox 1,000 feet high. Like something you'd see in a movie, all 8 were round, disk shaped saucers. All had a different color light on the bottom: Green, Red, Yellow, Blue, White, Orange ect... One by one they vanished as if they were shot out of the sky one at a time. I believe these craft exist, it happend last night and I'm still very scared at what we saw, it was so obviouse you just cant make a mistake describing these crafts. They wern't ours.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

Independence Day in Long Beach, CA.;2012-09-21 23:00:00;17 minutes;Independence Day in LongBeach Ca. As I was driving South.  On Paramount Blvd, I was distracted by a strange looking object in the air.  When I arived at the corner of Paramount and Market St.  In the city of North Long Beach Ca. The best discription that I can give, is that it looked not much diffrent than the vessels portrayed in the movie INDEPENDENCE DAY.  Staring Will Smith.  But much smaller.  The ones in the movie that hovered over the cities. So, I pulled over to look and video this vessel with my cell phone.  It did not move but a little. it kind of bobbled very slightly.  I did not hear any sounds from this ship.  All I could pick up in my camara view is the lights flickering. I did not stay to see the outcome of the event.  Because I thought that I could get a better view from my up stairs window.  Since I lived about a half mile away.  Which would I figured would have put me in a direct line of site with the vessel.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

Firs: Father driving me to my university (CSULB) when we noticed an object in the sky.  Object stayed stationary and began to move in various directions (Ex.back and fourth. We drove ahead and object appeared to move far away in choppy movements. Second:  After witnessing the first, we began entering my university's parking lot, we noticed another object in the sky and this time much closer.  Surprisingly the object seemed metallic since it reflected the sun.  We passed a few buildings/tress and the object just disappeared.  This objected appeared stationary before its disappearance.
