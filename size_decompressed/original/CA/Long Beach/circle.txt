7 PEARLESCENT HIGH ALTITUDE CRAFT IN V FORMATION MOVE HORIZON-TO-HORIZON IN TEN SECONDS.;1976-11-18 13:00:00;20 seconds;7 PEARLESCENT HIGH ALTITUDE CRAFT IN V FORMATION MOVE HORIZON-TO-HORIZON IN TEN SECONDS. At that time, I was standing outside talking to a friend, who also witnessed this.  It was the day after a Chinese above ground nuclear test.  We were standing on a hill, with Long Beach spreading out below us.  Weather clear, near midday.  7 opalescent craft, minute of angle relative size appeared equivalent to the size of our moon, flying in V formation at hypersonic speeds at a very high altitude (50,000' +) from south to north, horizon to horizon in ten seconds.  One of these craft returned briefly, to the zenith above us, turned sideways to exhibit the object's rounded edge and wafer/lozenge shape, which paused briefly, and then shot directly vertical and disappeared at lightning speed.  This reporter was 21 at the  time, (I.Q. Was 139) a former ROTC cadet (a trained observer) and had been an amateur astronomer and astrophotographer since age 12.  My father was a senior aerospace executive engineer.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Let me first say that I have been a pilot since I was 17 years old, flew helicopters in the Army and logged over 3600 hours of flight t;2006-11-26 14:30:00;5-6 minutes;Let me first say that I have been a pilot since I was 17 years old, flew helicopters in the Army and logged over 3600 hours of flight time.  I have very good depth perception and can judge altitudes pretty accurately.  This particular incident is the second unexplained sighting I have had in 40 plus years.  My 2 children, 12 and 8 years old, and I were sitting on a grassy knoll in a local park watching radio controlled gliders.  I heard an approaching airplane and layed on my back to looked up at the sky to watch the plane begin its' landing approach to the local airport.   As it passed overhead I noticed a small round, very bright, solid white object at a very high altitude, directly above me.  It was slowly moving westward when it stopped.  When this happened, I asked my 12 year old if she could see the object.  She said she did and asked what it was.   I then asked my 8 year old if he could see it.  After 5 seconds or so, he also saw it.  Just as my 8 year old spotted the object, it slowly started to move in a north direction for maybe 10 seconds, then stopped.  Within a few more seconds, it changed direction and moved south east to a spot directly over us again.  The white round object had completed a triangle pattern.  After about 3 or 4 minutes, we saw the object seem to tilt down towards the east and it now appeared to have a faint outline of chrome or silver to it.  It stayed like this for only 3 or 4 seconds, then appeared to rotate back up to its' original horizontal (?) position.  This day was fairly windy - 10-15 mph surface winds with a much faster high altitude wind due to a cold front system moving in.  The white object never gained altitude or drifted in any direction other than the original 3 directions mentioned. My estimate was that it was at or above 40k feet as there were 2 high altitude jets passing through the area that created vapor trails and the white object appeared at this altitude or higher.  My children and I watched this object for over five minutes - I had checked my watch.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Large white circle flew over Long Beach at a low elevation.;2008-12-13 23:30:00;1 Second;Large white circle flew over Long Beach at a low elevation. I was driving south on the 605 freeway in Long Beach CA when a large white circle appeared out of no where, flew horizontally across the sky at a tremendous speed for 1 second then vanish.  It had no tail and seemed to fly at the same elevation that police helicopters fly at.  The object looked to be about 2 centimeters in diameter from where I was. I know there was a meteor shower that night but this didn’t look like the typical meteor we see in Southern California.  Usually meteors are tiny dots flying way up in the sky with a tail dragging behind it.  This was a large light with no tail flying not so high up in our airspace. I wasn’t the only person to see it.  There were 8 cars around me that all hit the brakes at the same time as me when I saw it.  I thought maybe it was a plane or a jet since there is an airport and an air force base near by but I’ve never seen a commercial jet fly so fast or a military jet vanish.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

White round object seen in Long Beach, California.;2013-06-19 22:15:00;15-20 seconds;White round object seen in Long Beach, California Around 22:15 Pacific time, I was at home with my family, and my sister was looking out the dining room window when she noticed a circular, white object in the sky.  She turned around and called me over to see it but by the time i got there, it was gone.  I then began to ask her questions. The first question I asked was what it looked like.  She described it as a white circlular object. She said it looked like a full moon, but smaller.  She told me it was no star. It couldnt have disappeard like that if it were any planet. I then began to do some research right away.  I looked for ufo sighting with in the same city and the same month.  I then came across a video of a sighting in my city that happened 4 days prior to today.  I showed my sister the video and she said it looked exactly like the one she saw. My heart literally sunk thats when i knew i had to report it.  I need answers.  I want to know what is going on.  I just think it's very frightening because the same object was seen in the same city and state 4 days earlier.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Morphing objects playing with lights over Los Angeles orange county.;2014-08-25 21:00:00;1 hour;Morphing objects playing with lights over Los Angeles orange county Looking south east at night over towards Huntington beach.. I'm on the roof at 6 th floor level. The big balls or round objects were not much higher in the sky.. Not much neck strain! I first saw two yellowish light orangish objects side by side... They then moved above and below each other. That was about five minutes in the first position. After they formed above and below, another same looking object appeared to the right of the two above and below two! Now there was three. The new third object split and become two..  Now there was four in total. The two newer ones also changed position and were disappearing and reappearing as well as the two others. One would fade then come back on..  This went on for a half hour. The four objects joined to make a side by side symmetrical formation one above and one below it was like a mirror image of each other. Then two disappeared two stayed for a half hour then disappeared  They were huge.  Never in 17 years have I seen such big objects and I always sky view!  Not sure if it was a huge singular ship doing a light sow or four separate objects!  Thank you;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Loud military jet precedes 2 fast-moving yellow-orange orbs.;2015-03-20 20:05:00;6 seconds;Loud military jet precedes 2 fast-moving yellow-orange orbs My wife and I had a spectacular UFO sighting tonight. We were all settled in for an episode of Vice (HBO), when I heard a loud whoosh, but I thought it was part of the soundtrack of Vice.  My wife exclaimed, What the hell was that? So she's looking out the window behind the couch explaining to me that the sound was coming from outside.  I followed her as she dashed out the front door. I could still hear the trademark military jet-type whooshing sound in the distance.  It's sort of an irregular pulsating whoosh that starts suddenly and ends as suddenly as it started, and then repeats that maybe five or six times afterwards, the sound fading off. So we're standing out front looking at the cloudless sky, and I'm telling her You know, sometimes when military jets are sent low over areas they don't usually don't fly over, it means there was a UFO spotted in the area.  And not 30 seconds later, out of my left eye I see a light-orange-yellow spherical-shaped light moving NNE to SSW high in the SSW sky moving SSW through the constellation Orion.   About a second later, as I'm alerting my wife to what I'm seeing, a second light that looked just like the first light appeared about 3 at arm's length to the west, moving exactly parallel with the first light.  A second later, the second light faded out, and the first light continued on with its SSW trajectory a couple more seconds and quickly faded out. I've seen probably 100 meteors, including 2 fireballs, 6 or so comets, satellites.  And I've seen some unidentified stuff, too.  But this was by far my most spectacular and unusual sighting.  I'm 58. They moved slower than a meteor but much faster than any jet I've seen at that apparent distance. We both got the sense that the lights were at least 10,000 feet up. They certainly weren't real close. I got a real good look at the lights.  They weren't steady, like light bulbs. Nor did they strobe.  They were distinctly round, but diffuse, and they gave the appearance that they were moving behind a sheet of water, or slightly translucent film with an irregular surface. At the point of fade they were maybe 40% of the diameter of a full Moon. Some years ago when I spent a lot of time during the day at home, quite a few times I'd hear the same identical sound of a military jet overhead or nearby.  They're tremendously loud.  Only once did I catch a glimpse of it.  It was flying north to south towards or maybe past downtown Long Beach, which is due west.  I didn't know about the UFO connection back then.  I wonder if some (all?) of those incidents were UFO related. By far the most unusual object I've ever seen in the sky. And I kinda-sorta predicted it.  ) ((ADDENUM FROM WITNESS)) This is a better and more detailed synopsis than the one I submitted to NUFORC a little while ago.    *** On the evening of March 20th, my wife and I had an incredible UFO sighting that I posted about here. Last night we had another UFO sighting.  Same part of the sky - south of Long Beach, CA over the Pacific. At about 10:05 PM, I went outside to sky-gaze as I often do.  It was fairly overcast.  The Moon, which sat high in the WSW sky, was shrouded by the low clouds and cast a diffuse glow.  A couple of minutes later, due south and about 30 degrees above the horizon, another diffuse light appeared behind the clouds.  It was white and looked similar to how the Moon looked, but not as diffuse.  It gradually grew brighter, and as it did, two other similar looking diffuse white circles of light appeared, forming an equilateral triangle.  They were all about a third to half the diameter of a full Moon and two to three finger widths apart at arm's length.  At this point I yelled for my wife, called her on my cell, and knocked on the pane glass living room window to get her attention.  She came running out with her i-phone and saw the triangular formation just before it faded out.  As those three lights faded out, a brighter light appeared in between where the other three lights were, and grew brighter, casting a bright glow against the surrounding clouds.  We could make out a fairly well-defined bright star-like light at the center and the surrounding glow it cast was about three-quarters the diameter of a full Moon.  She managed to catch that final light on video before it faded about 30 seconds later.  All of these lights were perfectly stationary. I stayed out for another hour, but I didn't see any more.

When I noticed it , I thought it as the moon, it was as big as the moon if not larger, it lasted for approx. 30-40 seconds before it faded from a dark sky blue to the normal shade of blue sky. When it disappeared it was as if it went behind a cloud but, there was no clouds in the sky at all. Very strange & weird! My roommate has a picture of the mysterious bright light.

Large bright orange circle, rapidly ascending from sea level straight up in to the stars.;2016-01-23 21:20:00;5 minutes;Large bright orange circle, rapidly ascending from sea level straight up in to the stars My condo is right on the beach.  From my window I can see out in to the ocean and the brightly lit loading docs just east of the Queen Mary.  Last night, approx 9:20pm PST, I was watching TV and noticed a bright orange circle from my window, moving towards me just above those loading docs. I looked closely to see if there were any flashing red or white safety lights (like normal man-made airplane) but it was just a solid orange light with somewhat of a fog around it.. (note the night sky was crystal clear a few minutes earlier).. and it was approaching me fast!  I grabbed my phone and BOLTED downstairs to the end of street (which sits right on the sand) to get a video.  By the time I got there, what was once just hundreds of feet away was now thousands of feet up and same altitude as other airplanes (which you could differentiate by the flashing white and red safety lights).  The bright orange light continued to to move southeast and vertical *extremely* fast towards the stars until it shifted direction, dropped down super fast then faded away. I captured the whole incident on video..  It's very obvious no man made craft can move that fast.   Video submitted to ufocntr@nwlink.com.

Immobile, white dot, not shiny and appeared to be very high in altitude.;2017-09-09 18:12:00;:45;Immobile, white dot, not shiny and appeared to be very high in altitude. I was at the soccer field at California State University/Long Beach, when I noticed a small white dot in the sky not moving at all.  It looked like it was very high up and did not look like anything I have ever seen before in the sky, as it was very still and was not shiny.   It was next to a crescent shaped cloud (within the crest, south east from where I was), which I found interesting because I found video footage online of the same object I saw, sitting in the crest of a cloud that looked just like the one that I had seen, which also occurred in Long Beach. I spotted the object while doing sit-ups, and stared at it for about 45 seconds.  I switched positions to do a different exercise and took my eyes off the object for about 5 seconds, when I looked back the object was no where to be seen.  And that's when I started to actually digest what I may had just seen.   I stopped my workout and scanned the area of sky I originally saw the object, for about 5-10 minutes.  I was baffled that it had just disappeared so quickly after I looked away for a brief moment.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

Out of the right corner of my eye there was a what appeared to be a street light high about.  I didn't think much other then a helicopter was approaching.  As the light started to get bigger.   As soon as I focused in the light jumped a crossed the sky under the marine layer about a mile in 1 second.  In the process what actually caught my attention was when it moved across it lit up bright green, what appeared to be green flames with small sparks at the bottom.   I could not make out a shape of the craft other then an orb. It then stopped becoming stationary, that's when my mind was trying to figure out what had just happened.  I pulled my iPhone out and filmed.  The object was no longer green but yellowish/white moving slowly south west.  When it suddenly vaporized as if it went behind a curtain in the sky.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
