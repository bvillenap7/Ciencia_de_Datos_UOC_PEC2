Sliver  and Red Spheres Over Long Beach California;2007-10-07 16:30:00;1 hour;Sliver  and Red Spheres Over Long Beach California I was down at the beach in Long Beach, CA flying a kite. The wind was blowing out of the WSW so we were looking ENE when a spherical silver object flying at a high altitude (higher than the planes) from the North to the Southern sky and then stopped and hovered for a few minutes.  After a minute or so we noticed another sphere that was hovering in the sky just north of the first object. This object was spherical as well but gave off a redish reflection. The silver one then moved north and the red one moved NW at which point they faded away. Over the next hour about 5 more objects appeared over the bluffs from the NNE and flew into the corona of the sun, SW, where we couldn't see them anymore. I called LBPD who refered me to Marina Police, who transfered me to Local Lifeguards, who then came out but by that time they were gone. That call was made at 17:11. I called the FSS that told me over LB at 17:00 the wind aloft was out of NW at 15 knots for 3000 ft and out of the NNE at 10 knots for 5000 ft.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
green light travelling at light speed;2008-11-12 20:35:00;2seconds;green light travelling at light speed a bright green light appeared from nowhere in the sky as we were driving along the 605 going north, it appeared to be the same size as a green light you would see on a traffic light, it accelerated off at what seemed to be light speed right through the flight path of all the airplanes that were landing at the airport, and seemed like it would of hit the ground  it was way bigger then a commet and an airplane and going way way way faster  the people in the car next to us saw it too and they kind of swerved and pulled over  very strange ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Confirming sphere siting;2009-11-25 16:25:00;1 minute;Confirming sphere siting I was outside Long Beach City college waiting for my 6:30 class. I was talking with a classmate when I spotted two lights in the sky following each other. The were fliing from the northwest to the southeast at a high altitude and moving very fast. At first I thought they were planes but they didn't exihibit any flashing collision lights. After I saw them I pointed them out to my classmate. We watched as they flew and then just disappeared in the same spot. Later I realized that they had no lights on them but were reflecting the light from the sun, that by then had set, and that the reason they disappeared was because they flew into the shadow of the earth. It sould be noted that I didn't report this until now because I read someones account that confirmed mine. http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73462.html;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
UFO sighting Long Beach, CA - Small spherical bright light reflective object remaining perfectly stationary;2010-02-15 16:00:00;10 minutes;UFO sighting Long Beach, CA - Small spherical bright light reflective object remaining perfectly stationary I live on the third story of my apartment, facing East. I noticed something small, bright (reflecting light) and spherical in the sky outside my window.  It remained in a stationary position just inland of the coast. From my position I estimated it was pretty high, as the Long Beach air traffic was flying well below it.  Yet for ten minutes it did not move, so I ruled out balloon and blimp.  I tried to record it with my video camera, but the reflectivity of the object and the distance of it made recording impossible, it simply wasn't registering in my view finder...  As I put my camera down it began moving slowly toward Seal Beach (Naval Weapons Station) direction.  By 16:15 pst it was out of my visual range.  There was only one object. My background is irrelevant to the sighting.  I am not ex-military or law enforcement, and I have only seen a UFO one other time, with two friends in 1994.  Turned out to be a prototype for a DRONE the military was testing over the neighborhoods of Lakewood, CA. So this could be anything.  I am simply reporting it.  Hope someone else out there got a better look at it than i did.  Perhaps the pilots passing underneath it? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Orange Sphere dripping &quotembers&quot;2012-01-21 00:30:00;15-20 mins;Orange Sphere dripping &quotembers&quot My boyfriend and I saw an unidentified flying object on approximately January 21, 2012 at around 12:30 p.m. in Long Beach, CA. We were in the car traveling west on along 7th Street and directly ahead, a large very bright orange globe was in the sky about as high as a helicopter and hovering in one place. It was not a helicopter. I continued to watch it as we turned North on Long Beach Blvd. and it was still visible as we stopped at a Chevron Gas Station on the Corner of Long Beach Blvd. and PCH. As we got out of the car I continued to watch it as my boyfriend pumped gas. Then all of a sudden, about 3 smaller orange lights “fell” from the large orange globe. (Unsure if the falling lights were other craft or not.) I exclaimed in surprise to my boyfriend and he came over to watch. Then another several lights fell from it again, bringing to mind an image of embers falling or liquid metal dripping as the smaller lights fell and faded as they fell below our line of vision. Then the main orange orb disappeared. It did not fade into the distance as a plane would. It was just GONE.

I still have trouble believing this myself.;2013-06-01 23:50:00;45 seconds;I still have trouble believing this myself While driving north along the western boarder of a city park near our house, we saw an object that was completely unidentifiable.   I was seated in the passenger seat and had a relatively unobstructed view.  The object sat motionless in the east.  It seemed to be an orb of yellow/orangish light but the color was somewhat muted, similar to the way a Chinese lantern looks.   We could clearly see the stars in the background and trees in the foreground.   We made a right turn and travelled by the object along the northern portion of the park.  This revealed the objects proximity and elevation, to a certain extent.  It was silent, motionless, and the l light intensity remained perfectly constant for nearly a minute. ...weird.

Cluster of pulsing, shiny orbs viewed before sunset.;2016-06-29 17:00:00;30 minutes;Cluster of pulsing, shiny orbs viewed before sunset. It was approx. 6:30 pm and we were sitting on our patio when we both spotted 2 shiny orbs traveling together, then three, four and then six all appeared to be pulsing a white light, they would cluster together closely, then a couple started moving away.  They seemed to get brighter and then fade, then brighter again, one moved away from the group but was still visible.  We watched them as they moved in different directions and at one point two of them seemed like they  merged , but then separated again.  After observing this for about 30 mins, they all just simply VANISHED all at the same time, as if someone turned off a switch.........they were there and then they were gone instantly.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Rolling sphere across sky.;2018-02-24 18:38:00;2 minutes total;Rolling Sphere Across Sky At approximately 18:38 on February 24, 2018, while walking to my apartment, I happened to be looking up at the stars which were nice and bright (for urban Long Beach, anyway) . My attention was drawn to the west by a steady orange light in the sky.  It caught my attention because of its orange color and lack of any apparent strobe or beacon that normally would be seen on an aircraft.  I caught a brief glance of it as I was walking and then a tree came between me and the light so that I temporarily lost sight of it.  When I cleared the tree a second or two later, I noticed that the light was either climbing in altitude, or coming towards me (or both), and that it was a steady orange glow, almost like a landing light on an aircraft but way more orange.  I was kind of fixated on this light, expecting at anytime to see a beacon or navigation lights which would have given it away as an aircraft when it started to fade and then disappeared completely.  Not behind a clou! d or anything, but just faded out within the span of about a second or two at most.  There might have been a second light behind (closer to the horizon) the first light, but, as I stated, I was transfixed on the brightest light, and only noticed a second light that disappeared along with the first light at the same time.  That second light might have been an aircraft, as LAX outbound traffic is frequently in that vicinity of the sky, but I can’t be certain as I was only half aware of that light. Anyway, as I was contemplating what I had just witnessed (I was stopped a few doors down from my apartment at this point, staring up at the sky), an object came “tumbling” by at, what seemed to me, just above treetop-level! It was moving in an easterly direction and, for lack of a better word, tumbling.  It remind me of a semi-translucent, roughly spherical object with a very dim, orangey glow.  There seemed to be a darker patch on the object that rotated with it’s apparent tumble, this is how I could see it’s rotation. It moved at a steady, quick pace I’m bad at estimating speed, but I’d say maybe between 20 to 35 mph.  It made no noise and was visible to me for approximately 5 to 8 seconds, I’d say.  It moved eastward and looked to be descending as it crossed my field of view, but I could be wrong.  It had a steady glow, no flickering like a candle or anything.  I thought initially that maybe it was a bag with a candle or something in it, but I’ve seen flying lanterns before, and this didn’t look or move like the lanterns I’ve seen in the past.  It had been a windy day in Long Beach, but when I saw this object, there was no wind that I could detect. One other thing--as I was driving home about 10 to 15 minutes before my initial sighting of the original light, I had noticed a couple looking up at the sky rather intently on the sidewalk of the street I was driving down.  Now I wish I had stopped and asked them what they were looking at.  Maybe it was related to what i saw…;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
