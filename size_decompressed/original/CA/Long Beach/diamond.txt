I was looking for the space station to pass by at 5:52 pm. I noticed that contrains where being made by 2 jets . AT ABOUT 15,000 FT. 2 DOTS APPEARED BEHIND THE CONTRAIL PATH OF ONE OF THE JETS Contrails. I used 10X50's to follow the jets so I had them with me when I noticed the dots stationary. At first they seemed to be fixed wing air craft but they where above the jet trails. The shape seemed to change to a ball shape and stayed that way. they soon drifted apart and then one just disappeared. The second one stayed insight for a minute and then disappeared into the clouds. After teen minutes it didn't repair.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
