Fire dripping light over Long Beach, CA.;2001-07-04 22:00:00;3 min;Fire dripping light over Long Beach, CA. I am a Physics student at a University Of CA. On July 4th 2001 a friend of mine, his sister, and I were driving home from a fire works show in Long Beach around 10:30 or 11:00 PM. I was looking up in the sky in the back of the convertable and I saw a light suspended in the air, it looked like it was an airplane, except that it was not moveing as far as I could tell ( I was in a car going about 60mph) the odd part about this light is that it seemed to be dripping an orange-red fire, it would drip a few flames then stop, then it started dripping some more. I dont know how long the object was there for because we where driveing away. When we (my friend and I) looked back it was gone, a dark tree or building might have been obstructing our view, I cant say. I know what you are all thinking: it must have been fire works. I dont know about you but I have never seen fire works that stay in a fixed vertical position for any length of time and drip fire. that would be some pretty boring fire works. plus we saw it was after the shows. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the date of the occurrence to July 04, 2001, as indicated in the text by the witness.  We have no adequate explanation for the sighting.

Two fast movers over L.A.;2002-04-17 20:55:00;40 sec.;Two fast movers over L.A. It was the first clear night in L.A. to view the planet alingment so I grabed the binoculars to see if I could spot Mecuery. As I was searching below Venus I see two bright lights, one folowing the other, approaching faster than any aircraft travels comeing from WWN part of the sky. Lowering the binoculars I can see that the folowing one is speeding up and slowing down, almost touching the leading light then backing off and repeteing this earaticly but always in a straght line behind the lead light. I then run to my next door neighbor's house and drag him out side to check it out. I look once more thru the knock's to double ckeck for clearancr lights and wings ect. Seeing none I hand the glasses to him and sprint inside my house to get my video camera(that takes me appx. 15 secs.) as I return and set down the tripod I look up to see the last light do a 90 degree turn up off the deck(without slowing down) and accelrate into space(now due south from us) just like StarTrack Next Generation going to warp. My neighbor said the first light did the same thing just before I set the tripod down. He also said he seen the lightsplay lienear tag with each otherwhile I was getting the camera as I have described above. About five minutes later we see another light in the same part of the sky that the first two lights went to warp in. This light is the same color,shape and sizw as the first two lights. This light flashes two or three times then stays lite while it looked like it skipped off the atmosphere back into space then went out. The color of the lights were like floresent lights but a brighter more intense floresent. No wind, clear sky, no aircraft around. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed in report, but we feel confident that the witness is alluding to the planetary alignment, visible on April 17, 2002.  We have amended the date here.

Lights moving over SoCal in the afternoon;2004-06-12 16:00:00;1 hour;Lights moving over SoCal in the afternoon The family was sitting outside by the pool. I was just looking up at the blue sky and noticed a very small point of light flickering.It was a tiny point of light like seeing a satelite at night. It was moving slowly towards the east. I thought it was strange my wife looked for it and saw it as well as my 6 year old and 9 year old. We then noticed another one further east sitting there flickering too. We noticed a smaller light sort of circling the first light, back and forth around the top of it as it got closer to the second light. The first light seemed to become stationary. Another smaller/dimmer light emerged from the second light and began to move away further east.I then began to fantically look for binoculars etc. No such luck. I got the video camera and tried to film this but I do not think I recorded it as it was difficult to se in the viewer.They were very high altitude. Once you took your eyes off of them it was hard to find them again, but we did and this lasted about an hour. We eventually lost track of them.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

Two Lights;2008-01-15 23:45:00;seconds;Two Lights My boyfriend (web designer) and I (linguistics grad student) were driving down the 405 South highway to an emergency vet with our cat who had a UTI.  We were having casual conversation and then out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright light in the sky moving very fast then suddenly the sky went completely black.  At the same time we both gasped.  I did not get as good a look at it  as my boyfriend did.  He saw two bright white lights next to each other (like this -----> * *  ) flying very low (no flashing no blinking), and faster then we have ever seen any thing move.  Then instantly it was gone.  It looked like it flew into a black piece of felt and there was no trace of light anywhere it was just gone.  We were the only car on the road at that time and all of the street lights on the highway were out which we thought was quite odd.  Additionally we were well past Long beach airport and quite a ways from the orange county airport so we don't believe it was a plane.  Any insight into this sighting would be appreciated Thanks!;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

Except it moved (moving a short distance) then stopping and doing that again. The light was white, a big light in the front and a small light in the back.  It finally just went lights out and gone.   Time duration- 25 minutes.  It was high in the sky and way out in the pacific ocean;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Saw bright green flash & streak, no accompanying sound, suspected copper/thallium-containing iron meteorite.;2010-08-01 00:50:00;1 second;Saw bright green flash & streak, no accompanying sound, suspected copper/thallium-containing iron meteorite. At approximately 12:50 AM, I and four friends were standing outside and witnessed a flash of neon-green light which brightly lit the entire sky. I was looking in the direction that the flash appeared to originate from, in the southwest portion of the sky near Douglas Park, (a new commercial and housing development near the Long Beach Airport) and saw a vibrant but undiscernible arc or point of green light low in the sky, slightly above the rooftop level of a house across the street. One friend of mine, who was facing the other direction, also saw the flash but observed that it lower in intensity and appeared to have come from behind him. Several friends of mine living in an area in the general direction of the flash--in the Lakewood Country Club--reported having lost power at the time, several minutes later via facebook. The flash event lasted only a brief second, and neither I nor my companions heard any sort of noise in the seconds following the anomaly. I suspect that the flash was caused by a copper or thallium-containing iron meteorite, which would explain the green color of the flash, the lack of accompanying sound, and EMP which knocked out power.  I am an entering college student with an above-average scientific background.  I wrote this report to provide a coherent, detailed explanation of the event that occurred in anticipation that other reports would be made.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Saw 3 bright lights flying and then they stopped, forming a triangle.;2010-12-31 21:14:00;4 Minutes;Saw 3 bright lights flying and then they stopped, forming a triangle. Saw 3 bright reddish orange lights silently flying west in the form of a triangle and then slowed to a hover in which they went into a line formation.  The light in front slowly moved to the right and the one that was in that position moved to the middle and the one on the left slid outward making it seem effortless in all.  The one in the middle then moved up and they all moved together going back to triangle formation.  The one on the left then vanished like a light loosing battery then the one up front followed and vanished and next it was over when the last one to the right slowly vanished like so.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Bright green light over north Long Beach CA.;2011-08-05 22:15:00;5-6 minutes;Bright green light over north Long Beach CA. On Friday August 5, 2011, at approximately 10:15pm, my girlfriend and I were walking to our car after having dinner at ((name deleted)) Restaurant in Long Beach (XXXXX) East 2nd Street, Long Beach, CA 90803-5308)  As we were walking across the parking lot I noticed a bright green light moving in the sky. I thought it was a skyrocket at first so I kept looking at it, waiting for it to explode.  I was facing northeast. My girlfriend was right behind me but was fumbling with her purse, looking either for her phone or for cigarettes.  I can't remember which. Fireworks are a common sight during the summer in Southern California, and I thought this was part of a fireworks show being put on by an amusement park or maybe even the Orange County Fair.  But there was no explosion.  The bright green light appeared to just hover over North Long Beach. I should note that we were a few blocks from a south facing beach and that we were walking in an eastward direction through the parking lot.  The lights we saw did not appear directly above us but rather appeared about five or maybe even ten miles northeast of our location. The distance itself is a bit of a guess.  It was a clear night but I didn't notice any type of landmark that would help to determine how close or how far the lights really were, though it's possible that they were near the Long Beach Airport, as it is in the general direction of where we saw the lights. My girlfriend hadn’t noticed it yet so I asked her, Hey, what is that?   I pointed to the green light that I’d been observing and she thought it was a plane, but I pointed out to her that it couldn’t be a plane or helicopter because there were no blinking lights on this object.  It remained one solid color throughout the entire sighting, bright green. As we were watching this thing we could see that the normal air traffic one sees every night was still happening.  There were helicopters in the distance and we could see planes in the sky, probably making their way to Long Beach Airport or LAX. The other thing we noticed was that the green light was the brightest light in the sky at that time. We watched it move back and forth (east to west then back again) for a few minutes. It’s difficult to say how fast it was moving but I would say its speed seemed similar to that of a commercial airliner moving across the horizon. Approximately two minutes into the sighting we noticed a second bright green light appear below the first green light.  This light appeared to be west of the original light we’d spotted.  We didn’t notice any movement with the second light.  It appeared to just be hovering in the sky. The second light appeared in the sky for about thirty seconds and then vanished. After the second light had vanished we noticed a third light appear below the original bright green one.  This light was east of the green light and was red in color. This third light’s movement was similar to that of a helicopter.  I actually thought it was a helicopter at first but noticed that there were no blinking lights on that object either. The light was a solid red. No blinking or anything else that one would associate with a typical helicopter flying over a large city with an airport nearby. This red light moved faster than the first light we'd spotted.  Not freakishly fast but more like a helicopter than anything else.  It looked like it was moving toward the green light but then it stopped and appeared to just hover near where the green light was. At this point my girlfriend and I noticed that the bright green light we’d originally noticed looked like it was starting to fade.  It disappeared momentarily and then reappeared in the same spot we’d last seen it. As this was happening the red light began to fade and disappeared completely.  This left the green light as the only light we could see hovering in the sky. It remained in the sky for another twenty seconds (approx) until it too disappeared completely. Seconds after the lights vanished we noticed two helicopters flying (circling?) around the area where we had seen the three mystery lights. The entire sighting lasted about five or six minutes.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Two throbbing extremely bright pulsating orbs the size of grapefruits outside bedroom window in Long Beach, CA;2011-08-18 04:00:00;5min;Two throbbing extremely bright pulsating orbs the size of grapefruits outside bedroom window in Long Beach, CA Around 4am on August 18, 2011. I was awaken by my child's baby monitor going absolutely berserk like we've never heard it before. The way I sleep in bed I face our bedroom window( we only have one) which is covered with a thin piece of fabric. I was so tired, so I just opened my eyes to stare out the window when I noticed to BRIGHT( throbbing) lights about the size of a grapefruit at the base of our window. I lay still to make sure I saw what I just thought I saw, then the lights throbbed or pulsated again. Me being a skeptic, immediately thought that it was an intruder on the side of our house. I immediately sat up and sat STILL waiting to perhaps see the shadow of a human pass by.   I then got up to check on my toddler who was fast asleep.  I dare not look out the window, in fact it was like the event didn't even happen because I acted like I didn't see what I just saw. I tried to go back to sleep but felt CHARGED as if I had 10 cups of espresso.   Later that! day in Long Beach, we had a small earthquake too.  I felt it because I was laying in the bed, if fact the earthquake centered in Signal Hill, which is just 4 blocks north of where we live ( not sure if it's related) the earthquake was a 3.2 if I remember correctly.  Anyhow, when my husband came home from work, and started running errands together, I finally brought it up about these two strange lights outside our window, come to find out he saw them too!  But he was trying to rationalize what he saw as well. At the time I saw the lights and thought it was an intruder I completely forgot about the motion sensor that would have come on if it had been a person or animal.  The sensor didn't go off. I am so spooked. I don't think I'll ever sleep the same again.  I have feelings of dread going to bed now.  My nerves are frayed every time the baby monitor experiences even a little static.   Now I see why people remain quiet or go crazy or commit suicide or something, the range of emotions are over whelming.  I have NEVER had any interest/beliefs in ! extra terrestrial phenomenon nor have I ever wanted to see ANYTHING.   I'd probably be dead if I had see a space craft or actually alien...;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
UFO sighting in Long Beach, one drops from the sky, the other remained;2011-08-30 23:00:00;2 hours;UFO sighting in Long Beach, one drops from the sky, the other remained While driving on the 405 fwy, in the distance saw two barely moving exteremely bright ights in the clear eastern sky.  The light one the right side rappidly decended out of the sky.  I mean straight down as if it were dropped.  Minutes later the one bright light was still in the sky, I got my cousins and there friends and we watched the object for 20 minutes.  I called some friends who also saw the object. We tried to take a camera phone photo and video, but the only thing that showed up on the video and photos were planes.  The remainig object object slowly pulsed light and would occasionally dim. It appeared to be slightly turning. A friend of mine who was closer to this object said there were multiple lights on the object, from my vantage point it was just a big bright light.  The brightest light I have seen in the night sky.  The eastern sky was clear of any clouds and stars. The object slowly moved upward and down, but did not drop as the other object did. Regrettably we stopped watching it after 1 & 1/2 hours.  When I went to look again around 2am it was gone. A few other people have told me that they too saw it that night. On a side note I do not believe in aliens or none of that, so there has to be a logical explaination for what we saw. I have not seen any news reports on this occurance.  We are fairly disturbed by this, hopefully you have some answers for us. Thank You;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
2 white star-like objects moving in tandem, synchronized turn, no plane lights;2012-07-20 22:55:00;30 seconds;2 white star-like objects moving in tandem, synchronized turn, no plane lights Once in a while I like to sit in the back yard and gaze at the stars.  Tonight was one such night.  To the south I saw what I thought might be the Pleiades, but after my son and I examined it through binoculars, we could see that it was a single star. Remembering that the Pleiades was higher in the sky, we walked around to the front of the house where we had a wider view of the sky, and as soon as I started searching for the star cluster, a bright white light suddenly appeared high in the southern sky.  My son saw it, too. It lasted for about a second or two, and got about as bright as Venus gets when it’s at its brightest before it faded. I quickly grabbed my binoculars which were hanging from my neck and focused on the area where we saw the bright light. My son was also searching the area.  Then both of us noticed that there were two star-like objects moving vertically in tandem, pretty much due north, about two thumb widths apart, arms fully extended (my son later told me).  They maintained precisely the same distance apart.  As I was tracking them with my binoculars, I was explaining to my son that they were probably satellites because the lights weren’t blinking and they were moving about the right speed for satellites, although I was thinking that they were moving a tad too fast to be satellites.  But that seemed like the most logical explanation. Then he asked me why there would be two satellites, and while I was thinking of an explanation, the two objects suddenly banked about ten degrees to the east, still moving north.  They started the turn at precisely the same moment.  It wasn’t a sharp-cornered turn, but the radius was fairly tight.  What amazed me was how precisely they maintained their distance apart.  Then we both lost them around the constellation Cygnus.  My son later told me that the trailing object was the one that got bright. One explanation is that they were military jets, and the bright light was one of the jets reflecting the sun which had set three hours earlier.  And I suppose that the pilots could have been able to maintain a precise distance apart.  What didn’t seem right, though, is that they didn’t have any blinking or colored lights. They were single white lights, like medium-faint stars. I’m 55, amateur astronomer, been sky-gazing since I was a kid, and besides one strange object I witnessed from a plane a few years ago, which I reported here (it’s possible it may have been a Mylar balloon), I’ve always been able to explain everything I’ve seen.  Although the best explanation might be that they were military jets, the absence of blinking or colored lights or contrails (we couldn’t hear any engines, either, but they seemed to be way up there and we wouldn’t necessarily have heard them) seems to place that theory in question.  And I don’t have any other explanation.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Aircraft with white flashing headlights, no other lights, no discernible sound;2012-10-08 22:00:00;2 minutes;Aircraft with white flashing headlights, no other lights, no discernible sound Okay, this starts out as a pretty boring story, but bear with me – it has an interesting ending. I was standing in our driveway stargazing as I often do. The sky was mostly clear. We're 4 miles south of Long Beach Airport, and the sky was busy as usual with air traffic. One plane caught my attention as it flew south toward the general area of downtown Long Beach about 3 or 4 miles to my west. The only light I could make out was a bright white headlight that flashed every second-and-a-half to 2 seconds. When it reached my latitude, it banked east toward me. Now I could make out 2 white headlights which continued flashing in unison at the same interval. No green lights. No red lights. No other lights. Just 2 flashing white headlights.  It was much higher than the altitude police helicopters fly. The 2 lights were about a pinky width at arm's length apart. At this point I was figuring that it was a plane, and that there was a logical explanation for the missing identification lights. So I took a look at it through my binoculars, and I could make out 2 lights, but before I could bring it in focus it vanished. So then I looked without my binoculars, and after about 4 seconds it flashed once or twice more and then it vanished altogether.  The sky was clear. I watched for about 10 seconds.  By this time there was a tree blocking my view of where it would be if the plane reappeared, but I was satisfied at that point that it was gone, and that it was a plane with malfunctioning lights or maybe something else.  As for its sound, there were several planes in the area at the time and to tell you the truth I wasn’t even focusing on its sound, but I don’t remember any sound coming from it. So I’m not 100% sure. If it made a sound, it didn’t stand out.  So I spent the next 15 seconds watching planes, just kind of looking around, and then ! I surveyed the area right above me. Okay, now here’s where it gets weird. The plane reappears flying the opposite direction. At least I assume it was the same plane. Same size, same 2 flashing white headlights.  I had never seen a plane with that light configuration (I’m 56), so logic told me it was the same aircraft. Then about 2 flash sequences later, when it was directly overhead, poof! Gone. In all my years of stargazing, I’ve never seen a plane make a 180 degree turn in 15 seconds and then disappear.  So I thought that was a little strange. In the next hour, I saw 2 unusual aircraft, or maybe it was the same aircraft, in the north sky from around Cassiopeia westward.  The first of these 2 sightings began as a flash of white light, like a star, in the constellation Cassiopeia. I could make out a dark object either losing altitude or flying NE which flashed again about 3 seconds after the first flash. Then about 3 seconds later it flashed again, and then I lost it behind trees.  It travelled about a width of my fist at arm length between flashes. Then about 15 minutes later, an aircraft with the same description appeared in the NW flying south about 2 miles to my west.  It flashed twice, about a 3 second interval, and sometime before the third flash it turned east and flashed about 2 or 3 more times at 3 second intervals and then it vanished. As for sounds, again there were planes in the area but I can’t remember any sound coming from them. So if they made a noise, it didn’t stand out.  When it was flying east to west, it looked to be about a mile to my north.  Neither of the aircraft appeared to be much more than a thousand feet high. These sightings happened 5 nights ago. I’ve been watching the skies almost every night since and I haven’t seen anything out of the ordinary, just the usual planes and helicopters.  And I had never seen anything like that in my life prior to that night. ((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT)) Aircraft with white flashing headlights, no other lights, no discernible sound This is a correction to the report I submitted Sunday, October 14, 2012 at 00:51:43  Near the end of my report, it should read:  When it was flying west to east, it looked to be about a mile to my north.

3 Whitish-yellow lights in the shape of a triangle at 1st glance i thought it was a shooting star but it kept going fast and silent.;2013-01-27 23:40:00;1 minute;3 Whitish -yellow lights in the shape of a triangle at 1st glance i thought it was a shooting star but it kept going fast and silent. At approximately 11:40 pm I thought I was seeing a shooting star. It was not because it kept going and it wasn't bright enough.  It looked like 3 whitish -yellow lights.  I now realize that they were dim because it was so far away.  It was moving fast and it was silent.  These lights were some kind of craft. I have never seen anything like it before in my life. I am 44 years old and I have seen ufo's on two other occasions.  One here in long beach and one in upstate New York. There were no flashing or blinking lights like an airplane has and the lights were like the color of a light amber.  This ufo that I saw was far away it was in space.  I was very lucky to look up when I did.  This wasn't some close encounters of the 3rd kind or anything but it was a ufo.  The way it looked and the silence.  The 3 lights were in the shape of a triangle.   I am sitting outside hoping to see it again but it's too cold.  I'm going in the house.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
LONG BEACH, CA.. interacted with a UFO while stargazing and using a Green high output laser beam.;2014-01-04 21:00:00;7:00 minutes;LONG BEACH, CA.. interacted with a UFO while stargazing and using a Green high output laser beam. so i was star gazing in my back yard as i normally do and i come across a star i think is moving that may just be a.  i recently purchased a green laser which emits a visible beam 5miles, like what you see in the military.  i come across what i think is a satellite . so i point my laser at it and it seems to have moved away from it,  i thought i was tripping or maybe had shaky hands so i position myself against my step fathers truck to get a posture while pointing and using my 2 hands instead of one. Here comes the crazy part.  As i start pointing my laser at this object i notice that it is moving and not moving in a single direction as you would see with a satellite.  this thing starts moving left, right, side to side almost trying get out of my beam as i point at it, i do this for about 2 mins until i start feeling like i should tell some one but know one at my home was home and nor where any of my neighbors in their backyards . So what do i do ? well, i thought since i am seeing this and i cant tell know one nor video tape it i get the idea to start circling the object as to attract people to looking at it instead of me pointing a laser directly on it.  i want to add that this idea came because i live along side the 710 fwy and i know for a fact people can see my beam from far so i new i can maybe get some people in traffic to see it and i hopefully was successful with that cause what happen next gave me the chills up and down my spine and i still have the chills as i write this. also i want to add that this isn't the first time i seen something i cant identify, but it is the first time i ever interacted with one . As i start circling the object it get more aggressive to moving away from the light as if knowing i am circling it and in doing so giving up its position , i continue to do so and it keeps trying get out of the circle i put it in, i then notice that when ever the beam would be in front of its direction it will quickly move away from it as if it was scared of crossing it as weird as it sounds.  i know this wasn't a satellite nor a plan cause planes cant move that fast nor in the aggressive manner this object moved.  I then start to notice that this object is positioning itself over my house , pretty much right over me so at this point i am pointing straight up with my neck looking straight up to the point my neck hurts . i got kinda freaked out at that point even more and start thinking about all abduction movies and thinking maybe this thing is position itself over me to know my location, i don't know but it really freaked me out . now my laser starts dying which emits a le! ss visible beam that can bee seen , at this same time i notice the object starts to also fade but still remains over what looks to me like its directly over me but just in the heavens with the stars pretty much hanging out flying around. my laser then dies and honestly i felt alone at that moment cause i was in complete darkness and it hit me that what i was seeing was real and was interacting with me and my laser beam . i stare at it for a couple mins more , noticing that its not really moving anymore but staying directly above me where it positioned itself in the heavens.  my lasers off,i am in darkness, i start getting more freaked out thinking that maybe its gonna get me , beam me up , i just start thinking of all the movies i seen with people interacting with ufo's which never end well. i wont lie i start feeling fear in me and something telling me go inside the house and recharge my laser. i do so , and decide to report for the first time an experience i have with a ufo that to me is the scariest encounter i have ever had the privilege of seeing . since a kid i have star gazed, i am 29. i have seen many weird things in the skies i cant explain to this day which i am sure allot of people have seen things many times also if they star gaze frequently thru their life . what i saw was real and i really cant explain any more into detail about it but what i explained . i haven't gone back outside my house yet and do plan to after i finish this sighting description . honestly i am kinda scared to go back out and look at the sky and or see if its s! till in the same spot but i am only because of my curiosity and faith that nothing bad will happen to me .  it looked exactly like a dim star or satellite that moves in a single continues lane that many people i am sure have seen . it didn't make any different colors it just stayed white like the stars , it moved quick, it moved away from my laser as if it were scared of it or didn't want to be seen or pointed out. i don't know what it was but know it wasn't a plane . i really wish i had someone over tonight to be my witness . i actually bought the laser because i would frequently see things through out my life in the skies, that i just wanted to finally point them out when star gazing and hopefully show other people . sadly i was alone and still am , my report is done and i hope who ever reads this maybe gets the same idea with the laser pointer and or someone saw a green beam pointing along the 710 fwy at an object moving away from my beam in the skies high above the heavens , at 9:00 pm . this is is not a hoax. hopefully some one has seen something similar or interacted with a ! ufo as i have with a high output green laser beam .;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
06/14/14 Strange light, amazing speed, changed locations;2014-06-14 22:30:00;5 minutes;06/14/14 Strange light, amazing speed, changed locations Approx. 10:30 in the eve I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette, I normally see air traffic from the airport and view the skies often, this eve I was looking up toward the ocean beach are and noticed an odd light, it wasn't a helicopter or plane of any type. What brought my attention, it was abnormal in color and flickering and standing still just above the horizon. I watched for a few moments then at an unbelievable speed it zipped to the left and stopped, I knew because of the speed it moved it was something to watch. it sat there for a few moments then zipped again this time towards my location, that's when I thought to myself this thing has amazing speed, then all of a sudden it zipped up at an angle again towards my location traveling so fast it disappeared to what must have been the upper atmosphere, it wasn't falling it was climbing at such a speed, that nothing I have ever seen before compared to it. Then 2 days later the local news stations reported! UFO's spotted on or around that same time frame;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

Then headed west extremely fast, stopped again then moved west. I was looking at the moon, I noticed what looked liked 2 blinking blue lights high in the sky not moving, then it started moving east to west exteremly fast, it stopped again for a few seconds and then took off again moving west and was out of view in a couple seconds ..  It was over head then out of view in about 20 seconds.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
High altitude bright white light strobe, multidirectional and stationary.;2015-09-30 20:00:00;30 minutes;High altitude bright white light strobe, multidirectional and stationary. Again tonight, saw a very high-altitude craft which presents a bright white light like a strobe every minute or so.  Moving about in the sky just north of me and eventually moved off north-east.  Slow strobe of white light approximately 2-3 seconds duration with magnitude similar to Jupiter.   Faster strobe follows in approximately 15 seconds after the first, is of less than 1/2 second duration and significantly brighter than the slow strobe.   This craft may remain in one position for a time or it may move in different directions.  I cannot tell if it is in our atmosphere or beyond.  It makes no sound.  I know of know aircraft, or space craft that behaves as this does.   Have been seeing this phenomenon for over 2 years now, every couple of months or so.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Orange orb, then 22 minutes later, a blue light that disappeared in <2 seconds.;2016-08-18 20:23:00;30 seconds;Orange orb, then 22 minutes later, a blue light that disappeared in <2 seconds. An avid sky-watcher and amateur astronomer, I've seen meteors, fireballs, comets, and satellites, as well as things that are frequently reported as UFOs, such as aircraft, birds, bugs, and advertising lights.  I spend a lot of time sky-watching, and hadn't seen anything unusual in over a year, until last night. At 8:23PM, I noticed a bright glowing orange light a few degrees east of due north and about 20 degrees above the horizon.  At first I thought it was a plane, because it seemed to be near Long Beach International Airport, but the color wasn't typical of aircraft lights.  Through my binoculars, it looked slightly vertically elongated, as opposed to round.  I noticed no other lights on it.   I also couldn't bring it into focus and the upper portion was fuzzier than the bottom portion.  It slowly moved upwards and then slightly eastward, and then it moved slightly erratically and quickly faded out without a trace.  Having read numerous reports about the propensity of orange orbs to travel in groups, I watched for more, but no more appeared. Then, at about 8:45 PM, I was looking towards the SSE at a light that was probably a high altitude jet, and in the same general area a bright blue light appeared about 20 degrees above the horizon.  It was about as bright as Venus when it's at its brightest.  Then less than two seconds later it disappeared without a trace.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Impossably fast moving light following plane and evading persuit.  ((anonymous report));2016-09-26 05:00:00;~1.5 hours;Impossably fast moving light following plane and evading persuit. at approximately 5:00 am 5:10 am PDT I observed a bright white light over head at about 70 degrees south, south west moving erratically and periodically flashing on and off light. the object appeared to be right at or just above the atmosphere.  In the span of about 6in in my field of vision the object at extreme rate of speed traveled that distance and immediately stopped with out any distance to decelerate.  It did the several times over the course of the sighting. it moved in straight lines and in a tight circular motion and it appeared to hop like in motion quickly accelerating and stopping moving in a circular motion as well as quick straight lines.  At approximately 5:30 - 5:45 a high altitude aircraft traveling east passed by the object that was frozen in motion, after aircraft passed by the object it followed behind at about a half inch distance for 6-7in until the object broke away and traveled back to its original position.  Continued to move erratical! ly until 6:10 - 6:11 am it abruptly stopped and froze in place, when a second dimly lit smaller light quickly moved from the north to the south and met the first light and stopped at about 9 in away and moved from left to right maintaining the same distance away.  About 20 min later the second approaching object moved closer to the first. the first object quickly accelerated away and put about 12in of distance between them in an instant and then flashed out lights. they continued this same patter until I lost sight of both objects with the rising sun.

Hovering flickering lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect twinkling stars.  PD));2016-10-03 03:00:00;10 minutes;Hovering flickering lights. I went to close the back-door of the house and felt a random need to look outside as I closed the door as I've seen objects in the sky in the past at night, and sure enough, I see the lights I've seen countless times.  These very bright lights consist of a constant white dot with flickering red and green lights occurring very close to the white light.  The flickering is similar to seeing a single star that flickers at night.  All the lights are so bright as though you're staring into an LED bulb from afar.  These lights hover in one place and will slowly move up and down and side to side making figure 8 motions, sometimes moving horizontal and or vertical, and sometimes they will simply disappear as though someone turned off the switch.  I have been observing these lights since 2013 and they're consistent with their behavior.  I have nicknamed this phenomenon as the alien planet or Alien Star.  I have seen this happen countless times to the eastern horizon from Long Beach and Bolsa Chika State Beach, both in California.  The movement of the lights are so slow and smooth they cannot be a helicopter, and the lights are so bright and unique they're not a common known drone.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

Looking South East I find my alien star I've been observing since 2013.  Normally this object has a constant white light for but this time just the flickering red and green lights were visible.  The lights appear to be a pet of a single object but the object cannot be seen.  The lights always hover and move around the same way a hovering bee or dragon fly would hover, very short but quick sudden movements, starting and stopping on a dime.

6 objects around the Pacific Coast.;2017-05-20 19:00:00;5;6 objects around the Pacific Coast. Hi. We were celebrating kids b day party.  And around 7pm (still was light, very beautiful weather).  We (about 20 people) saw about 6 or 7 flying objects maybe more then 3 miles away from us.  I'm absolutely sure it was not nothing I know or I ever saw before, the same the other people say.  We saw round shape light objects.  Was flying not so fast around the cost of city of long beach.  First object seems as leader, because was as first and was most high, then was a little space and then was other I guess 5 objects behind flying the same speed.  And they were randomly first one high the other one behind was a little under but behind still.  Third one being agaIn different hight.  But all was very close.  And all these object were something like no like light blink but it was more like white bright shine light slowly up and off and just like this they were flying around the coast.  We saw them until one house was in front of us.  Some man record it.  But I can't connect with him.  But I hope I will.  Cuz I don't know him.  I was just watching them with happy feelings ND fear at the same time.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
One ufo.;2017-05-21 13:00:00;5;One ufo. I repeat just right before this report one from day before.  We went to park on Lo my beach and I really wanted to see ufo again but this time take least a photo.  Because the first time I was just watching.  And for my luck I really before we went back to the car we saw the same object as day before.   I have video and also photo. I am 99 porcent sure it was the same as the day before.  But the day before, I am 100000 % sure it was aliens.  This one was up in  the sky and it wasn't moving ..it was just staying at the same place and was it like very shining circle and again was lighting up and off.  I will send a video.  And after a few minutes, went down.. behind  my horizon.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Bright Venus-like stationary light appears in late evening sky and abruptly dims and fades in place.((NUFORC Note:  Iridium flare? PD));2017-06-25 22:15:00;7 seconds;Bright Venus-like stationary light appears in late evening sky and abruptly dims and fades in place In the SSW about 45 degrees up, I noticed a white light about as bright as Venus appears in the morning sky right now, which is very bright.  I'm not sure exactly how long it had been there, but the last time I looked at that part of the sky was about 15 seconds prior to when I noticed it.  It was about 1 1/2 hand widths to the left of Jupiter and a little higher up. Perfectly stationary.   As soon as I trained my binoculars on it, it dimmed to a faint star-like light, and through the binoculars it looked just like a star and continued dimming until it was no longer visible.  I continued watching that area of the sky for another 10 minutes and didn't see anything else that was unusual.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
I saw at least a dozen people pointing up to the sky pointing and gasping.  ((NUFORC Note:  Launch of the Falcon 9 rocket.  PD));2018-10-07 19:22:00;20 minutes;I walked out of Trader Joe's to the parking lot and saw at least a dozen people pointing up to the sky pointing and gasping looking due north toward/above Palos Verdes from Long Beach.  I have never made any such report before but this was truly a strange event.  The sky was cloudless but for only a few miles square in this northern part of the sky and in the middle of this clearing there was a large spotlight- like a flashlight around 1/2 the size of the moon shining eastward.  The power of this perfectly focused and precise light was extremely intense and appeared to cover at least 50 miles shining parallel to the ground at, and I'm guessing of course, a height of around 20,000 feet?  This enormous spotlight/flashlight was not moving whatsoever it was transfixed in the night sky.  Witnesses were absolutely freaked out, and although I am not too excited about much of anything, I will admit that this was quite creepy and without obvious, logic! al explanation.  My 9 yr old daughter will not stop talking about it.  We took photos. It lasted full strength for around 20 minutes and then abruptly tapered off, and close shut, in around 15 seconds.  Then all the witnesses started talking together, comparing notes, trying to figure out what we'd seen.  It was a professional crowd and yes there was some anxiety among everyone.  I cannot find a single report anywhere of this event but then again I am not part of the UFO community.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

I exit a building, specifically, a small gym, here at my worksite. I then quickly look up and right over my head a very bright but silent light passed right above me and descended about half a mile away making no noise whatsoever.  It looked very similar to a meteor shower although I don't recall meteor showers flying very close to ground level, below a normal aircraft would fly.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

Streak of horizontal light over Long Beach;2020-12-21 16:40:00;4 seconds;Streak of horizontal light over Long Beach We were looking up at the southwestern sky for the Jupiter/Saturn conjunction on December 21. It was close to sunset but there was still light in the sky. Out of nowhere a flash of light streaked HORIZONTALLY to the right of us.  This object was not falling, it was flying absolutely horizontal and traveling south, away from us. The object was close and low.  It was a very bright,  white streak of light with a blue color in the front and then the long white streak or tail. As fast as it appeared, it disappeared. The tail caught up with the front. It sped up and vanished. This was a 3-4 second event. It made no noise.   I turned to my friend and asked if he just saw that. He said yes. Again, the object was flying horizontally. I have never seen anything like this before..;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

This happened on 01/30/2021 at around 2:25 pm over the city of Long Beach, California. Me and my friends had just finished playing soccer when i looked up in the sky and noticed the bright light, similar to a star completely static,  i then told my friends about it and 3 of them were able to spot it as well.  However, I was able to take a photograph of the object  that minutes later disappeared, but could be used for evidence that it is an UFO.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
