5 dull red lights in V formation cruising over the coast of Long Beach;1981-01-15 20:00:00;10-15 sec;5 dull red lights in V formation cruising over the coast of Long Beach I have been thinking about this for years and, due to some recent TV shows, I have decided I should report what I saw. The event occurred in either 1980 or 1981.  It has been so long ago I don't really remember.  I do know where I was living at that particular time so that is how I got the year.  I was also in the presence of a friend when the event occurred. It was sometime around the winter of 1980/81.  I was living in Belmont Shores California.  The evening was cold and very clear with an unusual amount of starts out.  A friend of mine and I decided to walk a couple of blocks down to the beach to look at the stars.  I'm not sure how long we were there when we saw the object. I first notice the lights in the South West.  The beach we were at faces South.  The object was actually 5 lights I think.  They were in the formation of a gigantic V.   My friend and I watched until we lost it in the bright lights of the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.   We did not observe any type of body associated with the lights.  As we were watching we were screaming out for others to see but no one was around.  It must have been 10-15 seconds we watched.  I distinctly remember saying it wasn't making any noise because we could see commercial airplanes high up and hear their engines.  The lights were moving much faster than the aircraft but no noise and it seemed it was just lights.   What was really weird at the time is that the lights did not shine.  I never knew how to explain it but now I think they might have been like a LED light similar to the red ones indicating an electrical device is on. The only reason I am writing now is because I have recently seen a couple of UFO shows where people have seen the same thing we did.  The only difference is that we could not make out any shape or object and could only see the 5 lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I also seen the shiny bright triangle!;2004-01-02 11:45:00;3 sec.;I also seen the shiny bright triangle! Seen the same triangle that the aerospace engineer in El Segundo seen on the 2nd of January 2004 at 11:45 AM while returning from breakfast at Uncle Bud's restruant.  Right after turning East on Del Amo Blvd. from south bound Clark Ave. I saw what appeared to be a meteor at first streaking straght down leaving a heavy blue tinted smoke trail behind it. Then I noticed that it was triangle shape and bigger than any normal jet liner that I have ever seen, bigger than a C-5.  The next thing it did was a 180 barrel roll really quick with the smoke trails off the wing tips following them like you would see an airplane in a air show do.  Then the smoke comeing off the thing changed to a light rusty brown for the last 1/5th of the total length of the smoke trail it was leaving (about 2000' to 3000' in lenght). Then it just disappeared, quit, was gone just leaving the smoke trail to drift slowly to the East East South.  I would say that it disapeared at about 5000' to 6000' ASL over the City of Cypress CA. The angle of the view of the elevation at my location was about 11 O' clock high and the angle South off Del Amo Blvd. was about 5'.  The wing tips and nose of the thing were bright blue/white and the body was shiny bright like it was coverd with the light from an arc welder's arc.  A Lakewood Sheriff also witnessed this after he pulled into the lane next to me after makeing a left turn from Civic Center Dr.onto Del Amo Blvd. East bound. He was still looking at the smoke trail as I glanced around before jogging right onto the service road for my tract. That's when I got a good look at the two color smoke trail because by the time I pulled into my driveway about a min and a half later the smoke trail was despersing and was all one color now (smokey light blue).  All I can say is that this thing was hauling ass and I was waiting for a sonic boom but heard nothing as it was a nice clear morning and the marine layer had just burned off and I had my window rolled down and the sliding back window of my pick up open.  Mr. Davenport and the NUFORC webmaster, you people are doing a bang up job. Keep up the good work. The truth is UP there.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
On Dec 25th , 2004 I was heading east on stearns going towards cal state long beach on my way home for christmas dinner. As I made a ri;2004-12-25 20:00:00;3 mins;On Dec 25th , 2004 I was heading east on stearns going towards cal state long beach on my way home for christmas dinner.  As I made a right turn onto stearns , I looked to my left side and I saw a triangular object in the sky.  It seem to be the same object I had seen maybe two years earlier on studebaker rd in long beach around 12 midnight.  Ever since the first sighting ive been keeping my eyes open.  As I made the turn I saw the UFO and it was flying low and was extremely quiet/ hovering over some homes, some 40 feet in the air maybe higher. As I was heading east on stearns the object was parrallel to me and was heading west. I noticed there were no cars around, so i slammed on my brakes turned off my radio and rolled down the window. I heard no sound coming from the object and since there was no traffic I made a quick U turn. As soon as i made the U turn (now heading west) I was trying to intersect it to make sure it was the same object i had seen before but as I hit clark st. The object made a quick 80 to 90 degree turn and just disappeared. My vision was blocked by some trees and as I was on the corner of stearns and clark the object just vanished. It seemed like it knew what i was doing. This area is near the long beach airport and I know for a fact that this is not a place to do testing of military planes. Ive never called the l.b airport or authorities since I know they wont do anything about it but it was a triangular shaped object, black, it had some lights on each corner of the triangle and was extremely silent. This happen to be the second time i saw this object in the same area. The first time i saw this object was about 2002-2003 at around midnight Iam not to certain of the date. I was staring into the nights sky and was driving south on studebaker when all of a sudden i noticed the object dropping altitude rapidly. I figured it was a plane since the airport of long beach is so close. As the object dropped i slowed down.Since there was no traffic i completely stopped my car in the middle of the road and another vehicle traveling beside me was also slowed down but kept on going. I a stared at the object it must of been close enough to me that i could of gotten out of my car and hit it with a baseball. As I sat in my car with the windows down and looking up at the object which had to be hovering was going so slow and there was NO sound whatsoever coming out of this object. I could clearly see the details of the triangular object. It had lights on the tips of the triangle and was extremely silent.As it kept heading towards me by the time it hovered over my car for a brief couple of seconds it made a 45 degree turn and started going towards the residential homes. Thats when i made the same turn in my car trying to follow it but as I made the turn the object took off over the homes at a very very fast speed. Something a plane cant do. As i made the turn west I hit a school with a tall fence which I jumped out of my car and climbed the fence so i could get a better close view of it,I also did it just to make sure i wasnt going crazy but all i saw was the back end of object hovering over the homes at a high rate of speed and it vanished. Once again i didnt call the authorities since i didnt want to cause any problems for myself.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
V shaped light formation;2006-11-13 19:45:00;4 to 5 seconds;V shaped light formation A V shaped craft traveling in a S.E direction. It looked exactly like the image submitted to your site by the couple from Hutchinson, KS on 10/30/2006. It was a large silent fast moving formation of large dimmed lights. The object flow almost straight overhead. I live close to the Long Beach airport and I see aircraft all the time. This was not any aircraft I’ve ever seen before nor was it on any normal flight pattern for the airport. I could not tell if it was a solid triangle or a V. Living where I do you can’t really see a lot of stars so as it traveled it didn’t pass in front of anything that would define it as a solid triangle or a V.  But there were around 11 to 13 large lights all the same size, color, and brightness. A single light in front and pairs trailing behind spreading apart to complete the V shape. It’s hard to say how high the object was or how big. But if compared to a normal passenger jet, then it was only a few thousand feet.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
White colored upside down V shaped light/craft.;2008-02-26 01:00:00;3 to 5 Seconds;White colored upside down V shaped light/craft. I saw one upside down v shaped light/craft. It was white in color. It appeared for  I'd say 3 to 5 seconds it moved downward in the sky and then completely disappeared. There were no blinking lights it was one color only in a upside down V shape. The ends of the light/craft were hazy. There was no sound. The only other object I saw in the sky was a hellocopter whitch was far in the distance no where near where I saw the light/craft.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Perfect pulsating triangle over the freeway near the airport.;2008-08-22 21:39:00;5 minutes;Perfect pulsating triangle over the freeway near the airport. First noticed the objects while I was driving on the 405 Freeway, north bound, just passing the Long Beach Airport. I was on the phone with my girlfriend as I watched what I originally thought was a plane “pulsate” its front lights as it flew in the direction of the ocean. As I got closer I realized that the object was not in fact moving but hovering just over the path of the freeway.  Immediately I realized that I was not looking an airplane (due to the absence of the blue and red lights normally seen on the wings of the plane) and as the objects came into view I was able to make out three distinct lights forming a perfect triangle. The entire time I was just saying, “Oh my God, oh my God, what am I looking at?!”  This continued for about 3 minutes until the freeway began to bend in another direction of the lights, and at this point the other two lights began to pulsate in unison. I watched this go on as I made the left bend on the freeway, and the last I could see of the lights is that they began to change colors to a deep blue.  I did not stop because I was honestly too afraid to and still am shaken up by the whole experience.  Other then myself I do not know the other observers because we were all on the freeway, I do know that others did notice the lights because traffic was beginning to slow down and people next to me were pointing. At this point of entrée I have not contacted my local news groups to put them on alert, but I will after summiting this UFO encounter description.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Three orange circular objects flying in a triangular formation.;2009-01-13 21:30:00;one minute;We saw three orange circular objects flying in a triangular formation.  Together, they moved in an L shape.  Then they disappeared.  It was a bright star-filled evening.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Very bright, star-like object making loopy or jerky motions.;2009-03-23 04:00:00;40 mins.;Very bright, star-like object making loopy or jerky motions. First, let me say that I have seen this type of incident many times in my life, but this is the first time I am reporting it. I got up at approx. 4 am, because of a bad dream.   I walked into my living room which is all glass, and the night sky was exceptionally clear, no clouds.  In between some palm fronds I noticed something that was EXTREMELY bright, like a planet, but upon further inspection, I noticed it had a somewhat strange shape, somewhat of a triangle, with a larger flat top and pointed bottom.  It seemed to be  pulsing bright, dimmer,brighter, dimmer, AND was moving in a jerky side to side motion, while very slowly moving upward, I lined my head up with the wall of the sliding glass door to make sure I wasn't moving and I watched this thing making a weird, loopy motion, sort of wobbling here and there, but always slowly moving upwards, while it still kept getting VERY bright, then dimming, and getting bright, over and over.  I know it wasn't a plane, or a helicopter, or a satellite, or a star, etc........ and as I said, I have seen this same type of  star like object, ( MANY times through my life from the time I was a teenager, and I am now 56) that if you were to just glance at it, would seem like a planet or star, but if you start to stare at it, you notice it is doing very bizarre things, just subtlely, as you study it. I once observed an object like this on a beach in Oxnard, Calif. at 5 am. which was just above the horizon of the ocean.  Some surfers were in the ocean, and the sun was just barely starting to come up.  The object went directly into the ocean !!!!!   I was STUNNED, and apparently the surfers were too because they started yelling and screaming and going wild !!!! We had all witnessed something of the most bizarre nature, not knowing what to think.   I witnessed the object I am reporting now, for about 30-40 min. before I noticed it started waning in intensity, and it just  went out and vanished in a perfectly clear night sky............

Triangular object seen in Long Beach, CA;2010-03-16 21:40:00;15 secs;Triangular object seen in Long Beach, CA I was sitting in the backyard on March 16th, of 2010. I was looking at the constellation Orion, when I noticed a dark, triangular shaped object moving across the sky. The object was dark, but the lights of the city below reflected off the belly of the craft. There were also 5 lights, that seemed to line the outside of the object. It was silent, and moved smoothly, but quickly across the sky. I work in the entertainment industry, and part of my job is to be observant, and to notice things that are out of place. This was definitly something I had never seen before, and, in my opinion, was not a conventional aircraft.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
