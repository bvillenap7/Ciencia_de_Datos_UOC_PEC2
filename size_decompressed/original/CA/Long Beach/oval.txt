What caught my attention the house to my right in their back yard behind this large tree, I noticed a light. At first, I thought another helicopter. Then I thought the rotors would be slamming into the tree. I started walking to get a better view, at that moment this craft slowly came around, was hovering above me, and slightly descended no higher then between the telephone polls “maybe 10 feet above”. From what I was observing this craft designs had no propellers, emitted a slight hum, “NO WIND AT ALL”. At first I was afraid because I was thinking why can’t I clearly see the being looking at me through that thick glass then I remembered a saying of mine “to see /think clearly one must get past their technology.” Being a Mechanic I focused my thoughts observing the crafts structure then I looked again and at that moment this being kind of leaned back with an almost surprised expression. At that moment, I pointed my hand to him then I pointed to the sky, the being tilted its head to one side with a little smile. My feeble attempt to describe what this being looked like I determined it was male because we guys have a strength within our movements, I could only see from his “chest up” I didn’t see any hair, his face was little longer then ours and I must say was quit attractive. One interesting  aspect I noticed the “eyes/expression/personality” characteristics that of a cat or as plainly as I can describe picture a house cat but without the hair, fangs, claws that walks and looks not to different then us humans… 	 I have wanted to share my encounter Therefore, who ever are reading this and feel the need to contact me through email. All I can say is “I am not one to bullshit! There is much more to my story is and is truest every word.”   						Thank You, ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403

Dark round disc with bright steady orange light over Long Beach CA 02/25/2017;2017-02-25 18:15:00;20 seconds;Dark round disc with bright steady orange light over Long Beach, CA. 02/25/2017 I saw one steady and quite bright orange light about the magnitude of Venus or brighter moving rapidly from southwest over the harbor in a northerly direction over the city of Long Beach, California.  Weather  conditions were clear – no rain or clouds.  It emitted no sound.  I could not estimate its altitude.  As it passed overhead there was enough ambient light form the setting sun to back light it so that I could see that the light was attached to a colorless or black object with a more or less round or oval shape. It was the size of a dime held at arm’s length.  I watched it until it disappeared behind the house I was stand next to.   My first conclusion was that it could have been a drone, but it didn’t have the characteristic kind of movements usually displayed by drones.  Neither did it display any flashing lights characteristic of most drones that I have seen.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
