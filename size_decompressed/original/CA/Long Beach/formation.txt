Giant craft? with random red blinking lights.;2006-11-19 18:00:00;about 5 mins.;Giant craft? with random red blinking lights. I had seen something strange in the sky a week earlier.  I saw this ball of light or fire drip a small ball of fire or something.  You can see my report filed on 11-12-06.  Earlier today whole playing baseball I saw an f-15 jet fly pretty low over Long Beach.  I had a feeling something was up.  I had a feeling the last thing I saw was military.  Around 6pm I went out on the balcony to get some fresh air.  I noticed the normal air traffic coming and going near LAX.  I then saw these red lights flashing unlike the other planes.  I called my roommate to take a look and he also agreed that it was not an airplane.  We saw a group of lights moving about the speed of an airplane moving in a NW direction.  It seemed like it was flying along the coastline.  The lights would flash in random intervals. There where no other lights but about 4 red lights.  It could have been one craft, the lights moved as if it where one.  The size would have been huge, maybe miles wide! It was about as wide a 4 finger width, if you put your hand in front of you. We saw this thing continue north and finally disappeared in the horizon.  I went inside for a few minutes.  When I cam back out it had come back a bit like it turned around but was heading in he same direction again.  The lights would flash in random order.  It seems there where two on the outside and two closer to the middle.  The light flash was very bright and precise. These were not normal lights.  I would also guess the craft was in a v shape bcuase of the way the lights moved. I kept looking in the sky after it had gone.  I noticed some flashing lights again but this time it seems like an airplane.  I thought it could have been a military jet because the way the lights flashed where different than the other airplanes.  Later I saw a bright light approaching outside of the normal flight path.  Then the light turned off and I saw the same type of airplane lights that I saw after the red lights passed by.  I really think this was a military jet escorting ! or looki ng fir the craft.  This is my second sighting of something strange in the sky within 2 weeks.  I have never seen anything strange before in my life.  I am college educated.  I also have really good eyesight.  I am glad my roommate was there.   I think he finally believed me about the thing I saw earlier in the week.  It seems like there has been a lot of activity going on in the LA area recently. I hope other people saw this thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
many red orbs arranged in a trinangle;2007-08-12 21:15:00;3 seconds;many red orbs arranged in a trinangle I was waiting for a meteor shower and then I saw these bright red objects moving together at a extremely fast speed in a triangular arrangement. There were around six on each side and one in the middle. I was more than sure that they weren't meteor but I hadn't seen a meteor but I saw pictures of one and it looked nothing like what I saw.  They moved so fast that my mom that was standing right next to me didn't have time to look up and see them.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
A formation of lights hovering above the Long Beach Harbor.;2008-12-31 21:00:00;20 Minutes;A formation of lights hovering above the Long Beach Harbor. We saw a formation of lights that consisted of 4 white lights in the shape of a square and 1 red light centered in the middle of the 4 white lights.  This formation hovered, completely silent, and completely still, above the Long Beach Harbor for about 20 minutes. We were witnessing this sighting from our balcony in Downtown Long Beach and once we left to go get the camera and came back, it was GONE!  Our other 6 neighbors witnessed this as well.  We all immediately thought UFO.  There was no explanation for what we were seeing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

There were around 9 red/orange orbs sort of combining together forming a triangle, then a few just hovered around the formation.  They dissipated as they headed north, right next to the 405 freeway.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Two strange lights (similar to satellites) following eachother and varying in brightness.;2015-08-13 00:30:00;1 minute;Two strange lights (similar to satellites) following eachother and varying in brightness. We were stargazing and looking for meteors in the early morning hours.  We had seen a couple satellites pass over, when suddenly in the distance there were two lights that were very dim, then grew in brightness.  They moved like a satellite, as you could tell they were very far away, but they had no blinking lights of any kind.  I'm an avid stargazer and have no trouble whatsoever telling the difference between satellites and anything else.  They appeared in the north.  They were two lights, perfectly in sync, about a thumbs distance apart when you hold your arm out in front of you.  They were so synced I began to think it was part of the same object-if so, it would have had to be HUGE.  The leading light stayed the same amount of brightness for about 15 seconds, but the second light became VERY bright.  Easily the brightest thing in the sky.  The other two in my group all stood up to try to get a better view.  And the.  It was gone.  The second light went out completely! , and the first gradually dimmed until it was out of our field of view.  It was not an Iridium Flare, and two satellites do not follow that close together in perfect sync in orbit.  I've never seen anything like it, and stil can't figure out what it was.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Formation of lights.  ((anonymous report));2019-09-02 23:58:00;11 seconds;Formation of lights I was laying in bed about to go to sleep.  When I see a dim greenish blue light on top of a tree canopy about 30 yards away and it proceeds to get brighter and then flash off.  Then it does it again but turns the faintest bit of red at the very end.   Immediately after it turns into a formation of white tiny lights, about 8 or 9 llights spread out over 35 yards in total, now 40 yards or so above the tree canopy then disappear but then they light up again about 20 yards from where they initially lit up and do a  swirl like speeding off pattern astonishly and creepily fast.
