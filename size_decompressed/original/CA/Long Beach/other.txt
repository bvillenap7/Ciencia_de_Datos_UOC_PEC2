UFO watching the harbor of long beach.;2003-10-01 05:40:00;10 min.;UFO watching the harbor of long beach. When i looked up it was just floating about 75 ft. above the sports arena it's color was like a flat black and it's shape like the stalth bomber but only about 10 ft. wing tip to wing tip. I sat there for about 1 minute when it started rotating slowly to the left than to the right like if observing, then it pointed the way it was when i first started watching it. about 2 min. went by when it started moving in a straight line. The line of direction it seemed to come from by the way it was traveling was from the ocean docks of long beach. After i lost sight i went to the other side of the arena where i spoted it again and i told terry the security guard in charge of graveyard. At first he didn't believe me that it was a ufo untill i told him it's not making any noise and balloons don't stop and go, that's when i think he finally realized he had seen his first ufo. speed was about 5mph and It stoped one more time above a hotel for about 4 min. thats when i looked away to call another co worker and when i looked up it was gone. This was not my first sighting i'm 51 now i was 15 the first time. One more thing it was sort of a cloudy morning. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

BRIGHT STATIONARY LIGHTS  WITH PORT HOLES SOUTH OF LONG BEACH CA;2007-03-16 21:30:00;UNK >10 MIN.;BRIGHT STATIONARY LIGHTS WITH PORT HOLES SOUTH OF LONG BEACH CA ON FRIDAY MARCH 16, 2007 AT 2130 HOURS I LOOKED OUT A SOUTH FACING 2ND FLOOR WINDOW AND SAW WHAT I ASSUMED TO BE LANDING LIGHTS OF A LARGE AIRCRAFT APPROACHING TO LAND ON RUNWAY 30 AT LONG BEACH AIRPORT. I WATCHED FOR ABOUT 10 MINS. THERE WAS NO MOVEMENT. IT LOOKED LIKE A CLUSTER OF THREE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS. I THEN USED CHEAP, REALLY POOR QUALITY BINOCULARS AND WAS ABLE TO SEE TWO HORIZONTAL ROWS OF WHITE LIT PORTHOLES, ONE ROW ON TOP OF THE OTHER. I CAN’T SAY IF THE BINOCULARS PRODUCED A DOUBLE IMAGE. THEY ARE REALLY WORTHLESS. I DID MAKE A POINT TO CONFIRM THE ROW/S OF PORT HOLES. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE VERTICALLY CYLINDRICAL WITH DOMED ENDS (TOP AND BOTTOM) I’M GUESSING ON THE SHAPE IT JUST WASN’T CLEAR ENOUGH FOR ME TO BE POSITIVE. THERE WAS SO MUCH BINOCULAR INTERNAL REFLECTION THAT I COULDN’T SEE ANY FURTHER DETAILS. (HORIZONTAL LIGHT STREAKING) WHATEVER IT WAS IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEEN BY MULTIPLE PEOPLE, I SUSPECT YOU HAVE RECEIVED OTHER REPORTS OF THIS OBJECT.

strange object's shapped somewhat  like the number 8 sideways;2008-01-13 00:00:00;11/2 minutes;strange object's shapped somewhat  like the number 8 sideways I was sitting on the porch  smoking a cigarette facing  the east. I live across the street from the ocean and I was just  sitting there enjoying the beautiful warm evening looking around and up in the sky which I always do. I am always looking up. The object that I seen  looked almost like the number 8 turned sideways but slightly squared at the top and bottom and rounded at the ends. I would estimate that it was about 5,000 ft up and pure, and solid white with no wings, numbers, or markings whatsoever. It was not a plane, helicopter, blimp, or kite, or anything that I have ever seen before. As I was sitting there thinking what the heck was that, along came another one much closer about 2,000 ft. up and on the same path going southeast as the first one. I don’t know what is going on because I’ve seen a few strange things looking out over the ocean in the last year. I have to say that we sure are living in a fast changing, strange world lately!;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
Orange orb.;2016-09-16 21:06:00;90 seconds;Last night I saw a roundish orange light come up from the west behind our neighbor's tree.  It was probably 100-200 feet up and steadily moved horizontally to the southeast out over the ocean before it blinked out.  I got a good look at it through my binoculars.   Sad to say, I was disappointed I immediately recognized it as some kind of lantern.  I saw a burning flame surrounded by an egg-shaped transparent plastic bag and I could even see a few strings dangling from the bottom.   I called my wife out to take a look at it and she reached the same verdict.  No other orbs followed. This is not to say that I think all orange orb sightings are lanterns.  There have been numerous truly puzzling orb sightings that don't seem to match the description of something that was human-made.;33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
