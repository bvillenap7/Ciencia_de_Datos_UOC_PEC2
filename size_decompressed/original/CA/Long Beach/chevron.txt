Chevron/triangular orbs of light over Long Beach, CA.;1995-06-15 20:30:00;1 minute +;Chevron/triangular orbs of light over Long Beach, CA. About mid June 1995 I was outside in the backyard(Long Beach, CA) trying to cool down from the summer heat. My house is only about 2 miles from the Long Beach airport and during this summer evening I just so happen to look up at the sky when I got a sight of a faintly glowing lights moving silently from the ocean toward Los Angeles.  I believe there were 6 lights, arrange closely to each other that it formed a chevron or triangular shape, with the pointed end at the front.  All I saw was the faint light in this formation.  I would move my field of vision away from it slightly but had to search again to find it back because the glowing light formation was so faint.  It was completely silent and move slowly away.  After the lights had passed I could hear other small aircraft in the air, with it's typical propeller driven engine buzzing in the night sky.  I have only told a few trusted friends about this incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));33.8046158550385;-118.18191268403
