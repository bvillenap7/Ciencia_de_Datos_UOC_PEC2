Moon size fireball flies over the San Fernando Valley Oct. 1995;1995-10-15 23:30:00;5 sec;Moon size fireball flies over the San Fernando Valley Oct. 1995 location: http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=chatsworth,+ca&ie=UTF8&z=10&ll=34.254946,-118.490295&spn=0.465383,1.384277&om=1  It was moving fast from east to west from Big Bear Mtn. toward the Chatsworth Hills across the San Fernando Valley. It seemed low and the arch of the path seemed flat as it passed over Stoney Point. It was a blue green orange red fire ball with a long blue/green sparkling tail. The ball was the size of a full moon. I thought it was going to hit the Santa Susana Mtns. where the Rocketdyne/Boeing test site is located. It was bright enough to reflect off the pavement of the 118 Freeway and the hood of my car as I traveled at 65-70 mph. I heard nothing over the sound of my tires on the road. Maybe related to this, I got a rash all over my body two days later and had to see a doctor. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
