I was eight years old. I remember because my sister was an infant and she is eight years younger, born 11/01/77. I must admit that I saw Star Wars but there were aspects that I only came to understand many (14) years later. My Mother, Sister and I lived in one large room of a guest house on a ranch near Topanga Canyon Blvd. and Chatsworth Blvd. in the San Fernando Valley, California. For a few days prior to the sighting I would walk outside on the ranch. I would look into the sky and say to myself I know they're coming, I know they're coming... over and over again. After a few days of this I looked straight up into the stars and was only moderately surprised to see one very bright (like Venus) star slowly move toward another that was about 3-5 degrees of arc away from the first. When the first star reached the other star the moving one simply dissapeared into the other. Three nights later I awoke in bed and was drawn to look for where the bright orange light was comming from. I sat up in bed to see about a 15 foot wide circle or sphere of orange light moving slowly from left to right behind some big eucalyptus trees which were on the far side of a horse corral. The object was less than 100 feet away. I could see a, possibly, solid core with a glowing corona around the edge. I thought I should yell for my Mother who was only 20 feet away and in the same room as I. I did not yell instead I had a very strong urge to grab the 110 Kodak Instamatic camera on my window sill. My next thought was No, I don't want to scare 'them' away. As the light slowly moved down and to the right, behind some large bushes, I yelled Mother!!! U.F.O. She sat up in bed just in time to see the light but not the 'craft.' The next day, at school, I told my friends. They asked me to draw pictures. I drew pictures of the 'craft' changing shape, moving toward me and prepairing to land. I told my friends that I then yelled for my Mother and 'it' flew away. The reason I mention about my 'lying' about what I saw was that 14 years later I went to a hypnotist. I was not seeing the hypnotist for any reason at all related to the U.F.O. In the hypnosis session I began to see my childhood drawings in photographic form. I was not in deep hypnosis so I clearly remember the images, much to my surprise. Only later in life did I learn how children sometimes tend to draw their suppressed memories. I have done very little more significant investigation into my sighting. The date of the sighting IS APPROXIMATE but it 'feels' very accurate. The true reason I picked that date is the 1/9/78 4:30 AM Thousand Oaks sighting listed in this same list. Thousand Oaks is only about 15 miles from Chatsworth. I strongly feel that we may have both seen the same craft. I do know that the year is correct and that the day of month is approximate.;34.2547857594939;-118.588060917722
light seemed to turn off like one was turning off a flashlight;2001-07-28 05:00:00;5 to 8 min;light seemed to turn off like one was turning off a flashlight At about 5:00 Am I went outside to take the dog for his morning business. I looked up and saw a very bright light.  I have no idea how high it was, but I can say that it was directly overhead.  It had no tail, did not move, and made no sound.  Within a few minutes the light faded out as if someone turned off a falshlight.  I am not saying it was a u.f.o. since I have no witnesses nor did I observe anything unusual accept that the light disappered very rapidly.  I want to know if anyone else saw this phenonomen or is thier any explanation for the event?;34.2547857594939;-118.588060917722
ORANGE GLOWING ROUND LIGHTS IN SAN FERNANDO NIGHT SKY;2014-04-27 21:30:00;2 minutes;ORANGE GLOWING ROUND LIGHTS IN SAN FERNANDO NIGHT SKY. Traveling northbound, witnessed 6  glowing orange round lights in the sky. Brighter than any star in the sky.   At first i thought they were helicopters but there was no sound at all. They seemed to be moving at a rather fast pace. Seemed to be a very small trail behind them.  They started to disappear and fade away one at a time, until the very last one stayed for about a minute, then faded out.;34.2547857594939;-118.588060917722
