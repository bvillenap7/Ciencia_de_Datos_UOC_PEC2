BIG, black traingle shape with red lights at each point, quietly & slowly flew above/by me in LA area '92/'93;1993-03-15 20:00:00;45 seconds;BIG, black traingle shape with red lights at each point, quietly & slowly flew above/by me in LA area '92/'93 It was either early 1992 or early 1993 in Los Angeles area (Chatsworth), CA. around 8:00PM PST I was standing outside of my friends house, in the back yard, smoking a cigarette. As I was looking up to the sky I noticed a BIG, black object in the shape on a V or a triangle. It was big enough to block out most of the sky above me(I guess it was a low in the sky, but I can't say exactly how high). It had red lights at each point It was quiet, almost like a soft swoosh sound and it was going slow. Slower than a regular airplane. It almost seemed to hover, but it slowly made its way across the sky and past the trees. It just kept moving until I could no longer see it.  I havent repoted it until now, because I've been seeing all these reports of UFO's that are ALL similar to the one I saw in the LA area about 15 years ago. But I've never heard of someone seeing something in LA just in Phoenix, Illinois and Mexico.  I'm just writing down what I KNOW I saw.  It was a long time ago, but I can still see it clearly in my mind.  Are there any other reports of a UFO in LA during that time period? Thats what I'd like to know, because I DON'T think I was the only one to see it.  I am a male, 36 years old as of 2-2-2008. I noticed the UFO right before we left to a show/gig where my band was playing at the time. (I was about 22 or 23 years old) I own my own business and have no history of seeing UFO's. I also have a wife and child. I am NOT crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));34.2547857594939;-118.588060917722
5:40 a.m. 8/9/06  HugeTriangular Craft Seen flying over  Chatsworth, Ca;2006-08-09 05:00:00;15 minutes;5:40 a.m. 8/9/06  HugeTriangular Craft Seen flying over  Chatsworth, Ca Hello,  This first sighting of this triangular craft,was on 8/9/06. The time was 5:40 a.m. I looked out my bedroom window, that looks out to the East, and saw a huge bright yellow light, that was hanging in the sky.  The light wasen't moving,so I grabbed my digital camera, that also takes videos. My bedroom, is on the second floor, so I could see this bright yellow light very well.  The distance was very hard to determine,I put it just in front of the mountains.  I don't have a tripod,so as you know, it's very hard to capture something in the night sky.  The craft started moving, and I said to myself come this way.  I was surprised, it did come my way, straight towards me,  that's when I started to video this bright light.  The digital camera I have, doesn't give me the greatest quality, but, as  you can see, there is something there in this video. As I videoed this craft flying towards me, I took the camera away from my eye, to see just how far away this craft was,I was shocked to see it was almost to my house.  This story sounds hard to believe, but, it's definitely is the truth. I'm sorry I had the screen on the bathroom window, because, when I took the pictures of this craft, flying over my head, the flash on the camera was set on automatic, so it went off, and it left me with a picture of the screen,and the reflection of the flash.  But, I did manage to get a good picture of it, from my bedroom window, which also shows smaller white objects attached to it.  The video is also empressing.  This craft was silent, except for a very low rumbling, or roaring sound., and the size had to be at least 100 feet in lenght,and at least 150 to 200 feet wide across the back.  It was pitch black,so it does make the size hard to determine.  If anything, it might have been larger.  When this FANTASTIC craft, flew over my house and yard, I saw that the tip of this craft, came to a sharp point, and, was not rounded. There were large circular lights on the bottom, that started from just behind the nose, then ran horizontally, across the bottom.  There were 3 or 4 rows of these circular lights. The colour of the lights were of a dim off white, with a tinge of yellow.  There was also, a tiny green light,thatI noticed just off to the right side of the craft,but it didn't look like it was attached to it. There appeared to be a black void between the craft, and this small green light.  The lights didn't reflect off the bottom,they looked like they might have been recessed,and I could see what appeared to be something, that looked like grill work, or something, that looked like that over the lights. This huge craft crossed the street, and headed West,and as slow as it was traveling, which I failed to mention,was about 25 to 30 miles per hr. IMAGINE THAT? What was also incredible, was how it banked to the left to go South, without slowing down, or speeding up.  It was as if it pivoted on the left tip, and came round,so that the front of the craft moved to the South. It continued to fly South, over the top of the high hill, across the street from me. I lost sight of it, as it past behind a tall tree that is in my yard, but I could still see the lights that showen through that tree, as it continued traveling South, until it was completley out of my sight.  If you are interested in seeing the picture, and the video, you may contact me.  SIGHTING:  Chatsworth, Ca  Thank You,  ((name deleted));34.2547857594939;-118.588060917722
Bright yellow object flying from the east towards me.  appeared triangular in it's shape;2006-08-23 05:00:00;5 minutes;Bright yellow object flying from the east towards me.  appeared triangular in it's shape On the morning of 8/23/06 at 5:45 a.m. I looked out my bedroom window and observed a very bright yellow light to the East.  I have seen this craft 2 weeks earlier, and took a few photos and video of it.  I tried to take the best photos possible, but trying to keep the camera still without having a tripod is difficult.  In the picture you can make out what appears to be a triangular shaped craft.  At the nose of the craft, you can see a light, and at the tip of the wings there are also lights. The shape is very much there.  The light tracers are very hard to stop because i have no tripod. The camera i'm using is only a dig camera, and not an expensive one.  I also took videos.  I will send you these photos also.;34.2547857594939;-118.588060917722
