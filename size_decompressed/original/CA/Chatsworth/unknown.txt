I lost it for a moment and saw it again about 2 inch away and thought that moved pretty fast.It did this three times each one less bright.Then it seemed to stop and turn in a cicle , I thought that maybe I saw it do that because it was so small and so i was disorientated and thougyht I was going to loss it but it did stop and turned around, it justturned the way it came and speed off, much faster than it was moving when it was blinking,towards the moon, almost like the speed you would see a shooting star but i saw it much longer and it was a tad slower. It seemed to be red in color, like when you look at the stars and can kinda see if it is blue or red or white.I didnt lose sight of it untill it went past the moon, i couldnt follow it it was to fast.I know I saw something i am not crazy!planes dont just stoand turn around and leave faster than they came, plus it was to high in the sky looking like the smallest star you can see w/your naked eye.Im scared now.are there really aliens out there i never really worried about it but this was just staight up freaky!thank you for letting me talk about this my boyfriend thinks im seeing things but this was about a 3 1/2 min sighting i couldnt emagine something for that long, im sorry but that is just stupid.let me know what you know(if anything)about this.;34.2547857594939;-118.588060917722
