Solid light in a boomerang shape slowly moves across Chatsworth, CA sky.;2008-06-20 01:00:00;5 minutes;Solid light in a boomerang shape slowly moves across Chatsworth, CA sky. I was heading West on the 118 Freeway passing through Chatsworth, CA when a bright light caught my attention in the right corner of my peripheral vision. This light was in the shape of a boomerang. It was not a cluster of lights, but one solid light in the shape of a boomerang. The light was a bright yellow. At the tail ends of the boomerang shape the light faded out. It was slowing moving south. The object was moving so slow and so smooth at first I could not tell if it was actually moving or not. However it kept on traveling and soon was crossing over the highway. Then the object changed shape into a small dot. It looked just like a star, yet kept on moving. Then the object changed back to the boomerang shaped and kept on moving south, very slowly and smoothly, unlike any plane or helicopter I have ever seen. The the object/light, still in direct line of sight slowly faded out. It was NOT as if the object got smaller and smaller until you could not see if because it was getting farther. It never changed size, but the light slowly faded out. There was another car in front of me on the freeway, and we were both originally doing about 80 mph, yet we both slowed down to about 50. I am certain the car in front of me saw it also.;34.2547857594939;-118.588060917722
