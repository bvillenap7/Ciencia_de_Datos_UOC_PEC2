Straight line of UFOs moving West to East over Chatsworth CA;2020-12-02 18:05:00;5 minutes;Straight line of UFOs moving West to East over Chatsworth CA We witnessed 8 lights flying in a straight line/formation from west to east over Chatsworth CA. The lights were “white”, could have been mistaken for stars, satellites or commercial aircraft, except that they were moving together, exact same speed, and maintained spacing. Cassiopeia was the most distinct constellation in our view. They appeared to move toward Cassiopeia, west to east, then disappear in a coordinated manner upon reaching it. After they were gone, there were 2 “Free moving” lights — one which crossed through Cassiopeia from North to South, and another which was east of the constellation, yet also moving north to south.;34.2547857594939;-118.588060917722
