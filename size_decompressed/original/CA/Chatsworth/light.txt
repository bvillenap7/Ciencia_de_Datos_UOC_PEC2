Light approaches at high rate of speed and makes a ninety degree turn.;1984-10-01 20:00:00;45 seconds;Light approaches at high rate of speed and makes a ninety degree turn. I’m not at all sure of the date because I’m relaying this account some 20 years after the fact.   My husband and I were returning home one evening, the moon was full but it was only a blurred light behind a low(?), thin cloud cover.    We were walking to the front door when I saw a small, round, whitish light in the sky approaching from the west at a high rate of speed.  It was impossible to tell the relative size of the object or its altitude.   At first I thought there must have been a test from Lom Poc as they did launch many test missiles from this location throughout the time I lived in the west valley and they often caused some very strange displays in the sky.  But as this light approached our position leaving no contrails, it suddenly made a 90 degree turn, shot straight up through the clouds and rapidly ascended out of view.   The cloud cover parted in its wake in a perfect circle which continued to expand like a smoke ring.   I wasn’t quite sure if I had actually seen what I saw.  My mouth dropped open and I turned to my husband as we both spoke at the exact same instant:  Did you see that?   Neither of us could explain what we had just witnessed. I’ve told this story to a few people over the years when the subject of UFO’s would come up in casual conversation and to this day it gives me chills yet I can tell my listeners want to dismiss my story as just that a story.  The overactive imaginings of youth.  I have never claimed the object was extraterrestrial however I always do remind them that UFO only means the object was unidentified and flying.   I am still a practicing skeptic, but I just don’t have any rational explanation for what we saw that evening and as of yet no one else has either.

Bright star like object with red flashing lights;2013-07-13 01:30:00;15 minutes;Bright star like object with red flashing lights It was 1:30 am last night when i let my dog out in the backyard.  I looked up to the west and saw a bright light about as big as the biggest star in the sky.  i would say that the object was anywhere from 15-20 thousand feet in the sky.  The object was bright like a star with red lights flashing around it.  After watching the object for about 10 minutes i went back into the house and got my sister to come outside to witness what i was seeing.   When we came back outside, the object was about 2000 feet lower than when i first saw it.  As we both watched the light slowly get farther away until it disapered behind the neighboring mountains to the west.;34.2547857594939;-118.588060917722
