At 5:45a.m. on 08/24/06, i looked out of my bedroom window, that faces East.I observed a large glowing light in the sky, more twinkling then glowing, but bright, very large.  I went out to my backyard to get a better look, and to take my camera in case it was something i couldn't identify.  The object did not move.  I took many pictures and videos of it. When i put the pictures on my computer to view, the object seemed like a clump of spheres together.  Some pictures showed the object as one sphere.;34.2547857594939;-118.588060917722
