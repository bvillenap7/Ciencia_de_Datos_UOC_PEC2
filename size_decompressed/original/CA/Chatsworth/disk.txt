It was rotating and it made no sound at all. 3 of us in our gym class looked up and saw what first appeared to be a low-flying airplane.  It was the shiniest thing I've ever seen in my life and I can't even describe it.  It was hovering right over  an apartment bldg. across the school field.  It was very large and it made no sounds at all. It had a little dome in the middle and had little black jets all around the bottom of it.  It was in the middle of the day, very clear with no clouds or wind.  We looked away for a few seconds and it had completely dissappeared.
