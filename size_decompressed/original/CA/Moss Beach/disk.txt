Me and my freind ((name deleted)) were driving along the highway when our car stalled. We both got out and tried to fix it but it didn't work. There were no other cars coming and i wasn't going to flag any over anyways. We sat for awhile until ((name deleted)) said, What ((is that))?. We watched as 3 disk shaped objects came toward us. They came very slowly, almost hovering. They were over the ocean bay about 15 or 20 yards from us. We watched as they suddenly stoped and four beams of light emmited from the objects. they moved very suddenly and seemed to have a haze or blur over them. suddenly some of the beams settled on my car and it suddenly moved. All of the sudden they left. they went at unbelievable speed and were gone. When I cheked the car it was as if the car had been recharged (I had cheked and the battery was dead, along with the radiator having a crack). I was amazed, so was ((name deleted)). The towtruck came and then we wnt home. ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to have the second party submit a corroborating report.  PD));37.5338;-122.5061
