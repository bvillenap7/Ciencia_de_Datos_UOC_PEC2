Green Light in Sky at Moss Beach.;2018-01-01 14:46:00;1 minute;Green Light in Sky at Moss Beach While at Fitzgerald Marine Reserve, at approximately 4:46 PM, the sun was setting so the perfect moment to capture the moment came upon me.  Although, while looking back the pictures after I got home, between the several photos that I had captured, there is an apparent green object, almost in a full circle, but not quite. I took several photos of the sunset, focusing the sun in different corners of the shot, and the circle appears in the same spot.  I have done my own research, seeing if any others that occupied the beach that evening had possibly captured that same thing, but have yet to find anything.  In addition, I have taken into consideration that it could be a possible meteor or iridium flare.  Iâ€™m not fully convinced though.;37.5338;-122.5061
