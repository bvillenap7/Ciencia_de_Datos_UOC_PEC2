3 huge Triangle objects headed from Yosemite to Fresno seen in Oakhurst CA;2007-08-09 21:45:00;15 sec;3 huge Triangle objects headed from Yosemite to Fresno seen in Oakhurst CA 2 triangle objects side by side with bright red port and starboard lights (non-blinking) followed shortly by a third heading from Yosemite south along HWY 41 towards Fresno.Objects were incredibly huge, trailing UFO was 20 fingers spread at arms length (note: we are at the 3500 foot elevation). The 2 side by side took up our skyline (though we have many large trees around our house). They crossed our skyline in under 15 seconds with only a low rumble (no jet turbine sound). Witness  #1. 39 yo Male non drinker/drugs served in the USAF at Williams AFB. Williams served as a training base and hosted SAC TAC MAC etc. shows so I have seen all manner of airplane's (C-5 Galaxy etc.) Witness #2 39 yo Female non drinker, prescription drugs only real estate agent, currently a Vet. Tech. (because of the bad real estate market)  Note: There were 30 smaller (normal craft) traversing our sky's after, which being in the mountains is odd as you see very few.;37.3505;-119.6485
