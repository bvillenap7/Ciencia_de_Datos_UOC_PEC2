Boomerang-shaped object.  ((anonymous report));2018-07-19 21:15:00;1-2 minutes;boomerang-shaped object While on an evening walk, I observed, what I initially thought was an aircraft approaching from the west, with its landing-lights on.  It appeared to be gradually descending, at an altitude of approx. 5,000-7,000 ft, AGL.  I found this odd, since there are no airports, in this immediate area.  As it came closer, I noticed that had approx. 4-5 non-strobing white-lights, placed at roughly equal distances, along the leading-edge of each wing.  It had no stobing lights, or red and green wing-tip lights, as typical aircraft do.  Then, it gradually turned north, allowing me to get a side-view of the craft, against a clear, sun-setting sky, at dusk. I saw no tail, or fuselage.  It appeared to be a flying-swept-wing,approx. the wingspan of a Boeing 737, with a boomerang-shape, moving at approx. the same speed, as civilian prop-driven aircraft, that is typically seen, at that altitude.  As it moved away from me, to the north, I noticed a circular- cluster of s! tationary white lights, in the middle of the rear of the object.  I could hear no engine noise, as it departed my sight, over a mountain. Also, I am a subscriber to an online flight-tracking service.  I immediately checked that website, on my phone, and it showed NO air-traffic, anywhere near that area.;40.348;-120.4061
