50-100 lights traveling across the sky in same path at same speed.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-16 18:30:00;25 minutes;50-100 lights traveling across the sky in same path at same speed. A line of lights moved in a northeasterly direction over the house, traveling at the same speed on the same path. I counted at least 50, and lost count after that.  Using a star as a reference, there was a 4-5 second space between each object.  They traveled in a straight line across the sky with the same brightness, until they disappeared over a mountain. Duration of about 15 minutes. I observed aircraft with strobe lights flying thru the observable path of the objects, unknown whether above or below.  After about 60-70 had passed, they became more spaced out at around 45 seconds apart, which continued for about 10 minutes.  I also observed several similar looking objects traveling in a northerly direction, not the same path, but same speed and brightness.;40.348;-120.4061
