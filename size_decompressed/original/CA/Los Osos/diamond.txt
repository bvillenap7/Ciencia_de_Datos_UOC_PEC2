I live in an area that has minimal light poloution and I could see all the stars, and I thought this was Venus but Venus is not this low in the night sky that I have ever seen.  I looked at this very bright light to try and discern whether it was moving because I wan't conviced it was the planet Venus, and after 10 0r 15 mins of stationary position the bright light snapped off and immediately began ascending in a steady but wobbly manner with blinking red lights, and once it reached the altitude it wanted it proceeded to move north.  It's lift was not that of a plane nor when it began moving north after leveling off, it moved faster than a plane would or could, and the thing that convinced me that this was unusual was that my dog was very skittish as were the other dogs in the neighborhood with their barking, but my dog didn't bark he just stayed close next to me which is not our normal behavior when I go out to the hot tub, we play ball when I am in the tub.  He wanted no part of this until the craft had gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));35.3135;-120.8369
