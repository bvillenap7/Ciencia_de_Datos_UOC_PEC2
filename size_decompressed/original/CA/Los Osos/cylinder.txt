Strange small object rotates through air unaffected by its surroundings..;1999-06-01 15:00:00;3 minutes;Strange small object rotates through air unaffected by its surroundings.. This is probably a very different sort of report. The object was not a spacecraft. I have absolutely no idea what it was. It was about the size of a pepsi can and was moving by slowly rotating through the air. It seemed to defy gravity and the air surrounding the cylindrical object seemed to have no effect on its movement. It was like watching the object fly through the air in slow motion while everything around it was at normal speed. It also was not very far away from me. It was only about 5 feet above me in the air. I didn't see where it came from, but it continued to travel horizontally through the air on a straight path until it disappeared from view. It was completely silent as well and made no sounds.
