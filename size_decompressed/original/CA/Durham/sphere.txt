At about 8:05 pm I viewed 3 objects in the West moving to the East directly over my head--these objects glowed like a Japanese lantern but much brighter -- At first I thought someone had lit them and set them off but these objects were not rising in the sky they were traveling at a high speed with no sound.  They were orange like a fire glow or a jack-o-lantern color the speed seemed to be faster than a large jet liner.  They were traveling in triangle formation with about 1 mile distance apart from each other;39.6375;-121.7815
