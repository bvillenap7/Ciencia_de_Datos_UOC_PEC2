We went to get more firewood and upon walking towards the firewood, we both looked up to observe a white, fuzzy cloud like object with a clear nucleus flying across the sky in a slow manner, but faster than a regular cloud.  There was no wind nor any other objects including clouds in the sky.  We observed the object traveling S/W until it faded and disappeared.  Approximately a half hr. later, we heard on Fox News that National Security had launched a rocket with a secret satellite onboard.  Not sure it the object we saw in the sky was the satellite or the rocket, or maybe something other.;39.6375;-121.7815
