Blue diamond shaped object flashing in the distance in Placentia CA;2015-10-13 17:35:00;10 minutes;Blue diamond shaped object flashing in the distance in Placentia CA I saw a single blue diamond shaped object flashing in the distance above the tree line.  It stayed still for a couple seconds and then it moved across the sky for a short distance and remained stationary for a few minutes.  I had to leave and could not watch it leave. I have the video to prove what I saw.;33.8734951351351;-117.857015675676
