Cluster bubble object in air.;2020-12-28 14:00:00;2 seconds;Cluster bubble object in air. Heavy thunderstorm in area (rare event) sky was clear but gray,  light rain but sounds of thunder.  Object looked like a cluster of bubbles, it was still just hovering but spinning towards my right.  It was dark metal grey, no lights or other movement or noise .  I got chills and looked away and went back indoors because i got the chills from being startled by such object.  Whatever it was it was advanced technology.  Didnâ€™t look like drone or helicopter, and was definitely not a balloon.;33.8734951351351;-117.857015675676
