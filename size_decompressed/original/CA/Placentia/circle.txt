We all got out and looked and above us traversing the sky were about 30 bright orange lights, spherical in shape, moving slowly across the sky, soundless, and soon disappearing as they floated out of view.  They were clearly delineated against the dark sky.  We could not attribute these objects to anything we had ever seen before.   One witness was a Ph.D. biolgy professor, one was an engineer, one was a high school teacher, the other two women were college educated and none were inclined to  make snap judgements concerning the nature of the objects.;33.8734951351351;-117.857015675676
