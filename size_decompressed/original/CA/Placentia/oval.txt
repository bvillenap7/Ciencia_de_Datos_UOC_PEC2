Two oval orange disks leaving a trail & turning on and off intermittently over Yorba Linda Boulevard in Placentia, CA.;2008-01-26 18:00:00;3 minutes;Two oval orange disks leaving a trail & turning on and off intermittently over Yorba Linda Boulevard in Placentia, CA. Drove down Yorba Linda Boulevard in Placentia and saw two hovering, orange, ovals.  The orange color seemed to be some sort of energy, as it would trail behind them slightly as they moved around.  The two objects would hover for short periods and then slowly rotate as they moved a different direction (you could tell they were rotating because of the trail of material).  Each oval turned off and then back on at least three times during the time period we were driving down the street and watching them at the stoplights.  One of them appeared to start moving down, then disappeared, then appeared high above the other one.  I'm so glad there were three of us to see them - no idea what they were.  During the period, there were two aircraft in the vicinity.  One of them began to circle the area and continued to do so after they disappeared.  They appeared to be commercial airplanes.  Note that it was very dark outside even though it was early.  There has been terrible rain and the skies have been nearly black with rainclouds.   Also note that there were many other witnesses who saw these objects as we were driving.  The road was very busy.  An investigator may contact me by email.;33.8734951351351;-117.857015675676
