Six bright UFO'S with fire underneath them;2012-06-09 22:00:00;4 minutes;Six bright UFO'S with fire underneath them On June 9, 2012 around 10:00 pm, my husband and I were outside our home drinking when I spotted six flying objects that looked like huge fireballs.  It was a ball of fire under a big bright ball and they descended and then went back up into space disappearing one by one.  We only had our phones and were only able to take a picture of the last fireball that was leaving.  We were all in shock and even though I had had a couple of drinks, everyone else was 100% sober.  We ran inside to call my mother-in-law and her husband along with another family friend and they all witnessed them and right when the last three fire balls were leaving two of our friends arrived and they were able to catch a glimpse at the last three fire balls or UFOâ€™S.;33.8734951351351;-117.857015675676
