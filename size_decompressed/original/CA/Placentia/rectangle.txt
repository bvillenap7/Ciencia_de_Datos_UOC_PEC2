UFO descends and seems to land in golf course.;2014-01-01 17:00:00;1 minute;UFO descends and seems to land in golf course. While walking with my family across this golf course, in Placentia, California.  This ufo appeared out of the sudden, very high, miles away in the southern sky.   At first, my wife thought it was a star but it was moving in a funny way and getting closer and closer.  I recorded it with my iphone 4 which provide a HD camera. (1280 x 720)  The ufo was making a loud humming noise and it was changing color while spinning on its axis.  Turned completely red when is spotted over the tree.   The golf course was closed and we were the only people in that area.  It was 5 pm on Jan-01-2014. Link to video :  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C53OYAST9CI;33.8734951351351;-117.857015675676

I recorded it with my iphone 4 which provide a HD camera. (1280 x 720) The ufo was making a loud humming noise and it was changing color while spinning on its axis. Turned completely red when is spotted over the tree. The golf course was closed and we were the only people in that area. Its 5 pm on Jan-01-2014. FINAL COMMENT ON JAN-11-2014 : I want to add to this description box that on jan-10-2014, what I believe it's the same UFO, reappeared over the golf course, from which I took a HD video. If you don't see it in the search area, you can watch it from my channel under this same name but (PART 2). VIDEO 2 description.   Link :  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-GdS3mhvEZA   This video contains two UFO-sightings recorded on Jan-10-14 at 5:30 pm and 6:00 pm respectively, inside a golf course borderline to my house, in Southern California. I post it as a follow up to the prior video recorded on Jan-01-2014 and believed to be the same UFO. In these two videos I used a Panasonic HD camera which provides better close-ups than my iPhone camera I used to make the first video. (If you don't see this first video in the search area, you can always watch it from my channel, check it out! its also under this same name but PART 1. You are welcome to leave your comments.

A las 5:30 y 6:00 de la tarde respectivamente.  Dentro de un campo de golf lindero a mi casa, en el sur de California.  Subo este video como una continuación al primer video del avistamiento grabado el 01 de Enero de este año 2014. Donde creo tratarse del mismo ovni. En estos dos últimos vídeos usé una cámara Panasonic HD, la cual ofrece mejores acercamientos que la cámara del iPhone 4, con la que grabé el primer video. ( Si no haya este primer video en el área de search puede verlo en mi canal. Esta bajó este mismo nombre pero dice ( PART 1). Sus comentarios son bienvenidos.

Multicolored craft over golf course.;2014-01-10 17:30:00;2' 53;Multicolored craft over golf course. It was about 5:30 pm on January 10th, 2014.  Inside the golf course borderline to my house in Placentia, California.  When I spotted this UFO for second time (first sighting Jan-01-2014, after this event,  I wanted to have my HD camera, handy and fully charged..)  The UFO was coming and going over the trees and houses in a searching-like fashion way then disappeared for 30 minutes to reappeared about 6:00 pm. At this point, was really dark and I was walking while recording, (that's the reason of the constant shaking) trying to obtain a good angle for my shots.  I could hear a humming noise coming from the craft. During the first reappearence at 5:30, I could distinguish a rectangular structure with two cylinders on each side from which I was able to see these very intense round red and green lights with no gloss or brightness at all. Underneath were four round white lights, also very intense with no brightness.  What really called my attention is that no part of the structure or the cylinders is seen in the video.  Only a multicolor ball of light instead.   This is the link to the video:  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C53OYAST9CI;33.8734951351351;-117.857015675676
