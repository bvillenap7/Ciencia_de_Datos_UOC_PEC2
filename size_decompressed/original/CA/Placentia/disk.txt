The location is Valencia Avenue Placentia Ca 92870 USA.  If you have a reasonable argument, please give us an idea.  The machine was a square shaped very well lit, like a christmas ornament.  Very briliant and very fast. We tried to follow it with our eyes in a radius of 1 mile.  First we thought a plane was falling down, then we saw that it slowed down, then took off again.  We thought it may be a model plane but we have never seen something this fast before.  It went back and forth a couple of times then disappeared into the darkness.;33.8734951351351;-117.857015675676
