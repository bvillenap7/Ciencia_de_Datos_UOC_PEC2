I was driving East on Bastenchurry and noticed an object flying at least 600MPH from west to east along the San Gabriel Mountains toward the San Bernardino Mountains.  It was just north of the LAX landing path for inbound flights.  It seemed between 5,000MSL - 10,000MSL and looked to be a falling star but flying horizontal.   I have seen many falling stars and they are bright, this was dim with an amber light.  It just disappeared.;33.8734951351351;-117.857015675676
