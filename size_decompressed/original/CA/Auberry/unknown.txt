White Star Object over the Sierra Mountains.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS sighting.  PD));2009-07-25 21:08:00;3 minutes;White Star Object over the Sierra Mountains Sitting outside, my wife got excited and pointed my attention to what appeared to be a slow moving white light star. What's that? I looked and saw this object moving slow (to the east of us) over the Sierra Mountains from the north towards the south. Using our roofline as some reference, we saw it at about the center of the roof, and perhaps on an angle of 4' above the roof from my line of sight. I stood up to watch, while she ran thru the house, out front to the car, and had time to get the carmera and take a few pictures. It made no noise and wasn't close to us or the ground. Finally it passed the southern roof line and turned southeast, instantly loosing its bright star appearance. Next I saw a red dot as it disppeared into the black sky. It had no exhaust trails. I checked the time and it was 9:11 p.m. My wife had goosebumps and was very excited. I estimate it took about 3 minutes to travel 30' feet of the roofline, so it must have been at least few miles away. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS sighting.  PD));37.0703;-119.4611
