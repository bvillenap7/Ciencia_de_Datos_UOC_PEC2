Saucer w/ navy blue lights;2003-11-30 23:53:00;3 seconds;Saucer w/ navy blue lights This UFO encounter occurred on November 30th, 2003 at 11:53pm on 168 hwy in Auberry, CA.  I was following my boyfriend because we were on our way back home to the Bay Area from the Thanksgiving weekend.  My boyfriend and I were in two seperate cars traveling on 168 hwy about 60/70 mph. About mile and a half before that Sierra National Forest sign came up I had seen this beautiful navy blue light and a saucer shaped object that came above from the mountains, flying couple feet from front my car and couple feet behind my boyfriend car.  When I first saw this beatiful navy blue light, I thought it was a shooting star.  But then, instead of going straight as it suppose to go, it came so close to my car that I thought we were going to collide with eachother.  When we stopped at a gas station to get gas in Madera, CA., I had asked my boyfriend if he seen this blue light too? and he said, Yes.  I told him that it was a UFO, but he insisted that it was a helicopter patroling Auberry and Shaver Lake, CA area flashing it's lights so they could see all the cars going up and down the hills of 168  hwy.  But, I didn't buy what my boyfriend had to say because where we were driving was totally dark, no lights on 168 and I didn't hear anything.  I only saw this extraodinary object.  My only question is, What was that object that I saw along with those navy blue light?  It only lasted for about 3 to 5 seconds.  The object was so fast, it disappeared down the cliff.  I also want to know if anyone else seen this?;37.0703;-119.4611
Bright white light seen traveling N to S for 1-2 min., with apparent fighters in area immediately afterwards.;2004-11-30 17:45:00;1-2 min.;Bright white light seen traveling N to S for 1-2 min., with apparent fighters in area immediately afterwards. I was outside taking out the trash and as I was going back inside the house, I looked up in the sky and noticed a bright white light about 2-3 times brighter than a star, moving across the sky from North to South. First noticed when it was straight up (90 deg.). Object moved slower than a jet at cruising speed, but faster than a piston- or turboprop-powered aircraft. Color was very white. No sound. Object lost to view due to ground lights interfering with view as it moved to the south. Immediately afterwards two jet aircraft were seen (and heard) moving in formation from NW to SE. From speed and formation, they appeared to be fighters. (Note: nearest base for fighters is Fresno ANGB,the 144th Fighter Wing with F-16s) I am a future USN officer, and am familiar with aircraft day and night, as I live in the traffic pattern for Fresno-Yosemite IAP.;37.0703;-119.4611
