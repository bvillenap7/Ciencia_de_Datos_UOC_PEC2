IT LOOK LIKE IT WAS OVER LAND ,THEN OUT OF SIGHT. I WAS VERY SURPRISED THAT I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT IT ON THE NEWS OR RADIO.

I ACTUALLY HAVE IT ON VIDEO TAPE, A LITTLE POOR BECAUSE I MOVED AROUND TRYING TO GET IT INTO VIEW BUT U CAN SEE THE PIECES FALLING OFF. JUST WEIRD BUT EXCITING.;33.9379732026144;-118.132026143791
Bright Fire Object moving over city in Downey, California;2007-01-07 02:30:00;5 mins;Bright Fire Object moving over city in Downey, California It first appeared very low, looked like a clear plastic ball with a burning fire inside. When we first saw it it looked large and was flying low. As it moved rapidly over, it began to get smaller and then paused in one place for about 3 or 4 minutes.  It started to move again back from where it started from then it disappeared.  I caught about 13 seconds of video on my phone and 2 still pictures.
