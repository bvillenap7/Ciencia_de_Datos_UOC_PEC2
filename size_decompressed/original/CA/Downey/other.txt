Funny shooting star.;2008-12-27 22:17:00;2 sec;Funny shooting star. It appeared to be a shooting star.  What struck me was how bright and low it was. I lost it behind the leaves of the neighbors palm tree.  By the time I moved to clear the view I lost it. Now it was not coming in at an angle. It fell straight down,  I don't know if thats normal...I just never seen one do that.  I'll report this and see if anyone else saw it.  I just hope it wasn't a plane.
