Bright, discoid or shallow cone-shaped object in full daylight.;2011-03-16 15:20:00;1 minute (approx);Bright, discoid or shallow cone-shaped object in full daylight. While out taking a walk during the afternoon break at work, I noticed this bright, metallic-looking object moving across the northern sky at a leisurely pace, perhaps a third way of the way up from horizon to zenith.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, but as I kept watching I realized its profile was too round and solid.   The sighting lasted the greater part of a minute as it crossed my field of vision from left to right.   Too late, I decided to photograph it and snapped 3 shots with my pocket camera.  In the last photo the object presents a different profile and is seen juxtaposed above an airliner.  It disappeared from view moments thereafter.;33.9379732026144;-118.132026143791
