UFO sighting over Los Angeles, 2013.02.09 at 3:40am;2013-02-09 03:40:00;Seconds;UFO sighting over Los Angeles, 2013.02.09 at 3:40am We were driving on the 105 freeway east towards the 605 south interchange when me and fiancee spotted something off of the Bellflower Blvd exit.  It was a bright ball of light, a little bigger than the street lights, floating at a level no more than two light post stacked up against each other.   It was the brightest object in the area.  Keeping in mind that this is Los Angeles it rules out a star (both due to its proximity off the ground and  the light pollution).   We have seen plenty of helicopters and airplanes and that object was neither.   With the manhunt for this cop killer I know that anyone reporting this to the authorities would have been turned away. What makes this impressive to me is that my fiancee has been a long life skeptic, until today.  We cannot claim that it was a spaceship with little green men in it, but it was a UFO by definition.;33.9379732026144;-118.132026143791
Saw a light shine like a star it was mostly blocked by the high end of some tree leaves roxe up.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-05 00:40:00;10-15 minutes;NE of Downey, saw a light shine like a star it was mostly blocked by the high end of some tree leaves.  As time went on it slowly rose above the tree until it was completely visible.  It continued to slowly move up.  It could have been a drone, but Iâ€™m not too sure.  It looked far away, like in the Temple City/Arcadia area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.9379732026144;-118.132026143791

I was washing my car at the time while on the phone. I look up to see a bright light, brighter than any star in the sky stay in one spot for a second then fade away.  I did not see any movement or pulsation, just the fading out.  It was a lone, white light.;33.9379732026144;-118.132026143791
