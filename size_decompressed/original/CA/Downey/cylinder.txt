3 lighted cylindrical vertical objects in eastern sky;2009-12-25 00:30:00;unknown;3 lighted cylindrical vertical objects in eastern sky What Is This? December 25, 0:26 I looked out my window to sky toward the East and saw a helicopter, and as I looked closer, I saw further in the distance 3, hovering, cylindrical, lighted objects (looked almost florescent), which were hanging vertically. (about 3 inches long, measuring with my thumb and first finger). I went outside to look at them closer and they just hung there.  I thought they were going to make letters so I ran in to get my camera and ran back outside.  They had moved to the North about the same distance in the sky, one then started to move from vertical to horizontal, to the left, very quickly.  Then it disappeared directly to the North.  I was only able to snap 2 shots and only captured the image in one photo.  The photographic image shows an additional circular globe.  All the images then just disappeared.;33.9379732026144;-118.132026143791
