I was driving home from an Angel game   one night and was just minding my self.   Then when I was looking at a couple of stars I noticed they were perfecly lined up.  I was going to tell my mom but stoppped knowing it would be brushed off as an illusion.  The lights seemed to be moving a little slowly.   We started getting on to the off ramp of the free way,and a tree obscured the ufo.  When we got away from the tree the lights were gone and nothing was in the sky,it completely shocked me.
