The clouds moved slowly until one reached the full moon and looked very interesting when it circled around the moon;33.9379732026144;-118.132026143791
Slow moving bright white circular craft moving from Long Beach CA . to LAX with bright scanning light pointing upward.;2001-12-20 23:30:00;15 min;Slow moving bright white circular craft moving from Long Beach CA . to LAX with bright scanning light pointing upward. One object at approvimately 5,000 feet in the dark evening sky moving slowly Northeast twards me from Long Beach California to about Paramount or Downey California then stopped for about 20 seconds.  Then it started moving west towards the Los Angeles Airport.  Then it stoped for a commercial Airplane to pass as it was on approch to LAX.  The craft move a little south to give the airplane a little move room to pass.  Then continued to LAX and stopped moving.  The craft just stayed motionless over LAX for about 10 minutes until some cloud cover eventulally blocked my view. The object or the light source emitting directly out of the body of the craft was circular in shape and was bright white. A filled in V shaped white light rose above the craft about three times the height of the craft and moved side to side in a scanning motion until just before the craft headed West, then the light on top went away. It was difficult to see the actual craft itself because of the intensness of the light emitting from the body of the craft.  There was no sound that I could hear comming from the craft itself. Unfotunately I was so intrigued with what I was seeing I din'nt grab my Vedio Camera and I did'nt varify the time.  It was somewere between 11:30 P.M. 12/19/01 and 12:30 A.M. on 12/20/01 Pacific Standard time when I first saw the object. You can contact me via e-mail only at this time please if you believe you need to.;33.9379732026144;-118.132026143791
1 light, joined by two more form triangle and perform some formations, before disappearing and flying away in a pattern.;2002-02-04 18:00:00;5 minutes;1 light, joined by two more form triangle and perform some formations, before disappearing and flying away in a pattern. First off..i was coming home from a friends house, when i saw, what i believed to be an extrememly bright star.  I looked at it for a while, since i am quite interested in the sky, and stars and the such, and after looking for a good minute or so, i noticed 2 more of the same circular lights form behind it seemingly out of nowhere.  They then moved into a triangular shape and began to move foward.  They then started performing some type of movements..where the back two objects would split apart from the formation, and the front object would come foward..afer doing this formation three times, the back two lights disappeared completely and suddenly, and the first one took off in a straight line at an alarming rate of speed.  It then turned left after going for a good 10 seconds..then 5 seconds later turned right, headed straight for another 20 seconds, then turned left again and kept going.  This all happened over a little culvasack street, at about 6 at night or so.  It really freaked me out;33.9379732026144;-118.132026143791
The object was a circle that was blinking red blue and green at diferent times then another one was doing the same;2004-11-17 19:00:00;3 hours;The object was a circle that was blinking red blue and green at diferent times then another one was doing the same I was just getting home from my waterpolo practice, and got out of the car with my friend. My Mom, Dad, and sister were all outside on the front pourch. Its was already dark because it was like 6. but anyway i asked them what they were doing and the said that there is a circle in the sky about this size O or a little bigger. I looked at it and it was changing colors, like lights were blinking on it red green and blue. It didnt move for a whole hour just sat there we watched it the whole time. We also had binoculars so it made somewhat a little more definite. after about the first hour we notice that it was going South East very very slow. when it got to a certain point it just turned white and we noticed another small one below it, It was doing the exact same thing but it was a little fainter, this one was following the exact some path that the bigger one took. The bigger one after a while started to look like a star like it was disguising itself as a star becasue it had stoped changing color and was just white. We didnt watch it long enough to see if they disapered or anything. But we have never seen any stars out that way or that low and my dad constatnly looks out that way because he watches the planes come in. He is the one who spotted it first. personally i think it was a good siting, but not a very active one. except for the blinking lights;33.9379732026144;-118.132026143791
Bright Light made fast movements in the sky;2019-11-08 00:00:00;3 hours;Bright Light made fast movements in the sky Around 11:30 PM, saw a bright light to what I thought was a star just really bright, then as I was looking and observing the object moved very fast up and down and from side to side, then would station itself for hours then make movements up down and side to side, I would notice planes and other smaller planes fly by them with no recognition from either crafts. noticed the craft move very high and stay station there for the remainder of the night, i went to sleep woke up around 4:00 am and it was still there. Next day woke up and it was gone by daylight. I did notice at one moment the object broke into two the became one again a pattern of lights turned on in a circle then turned off the same way it lit up which was one light by one light at a time until a full circle then turned off one light at a time until the light was one bright light confusing as hell but i saw it. I could also see it spinning you can see the light spinning around.;33.9379732026144;-118.132026143791
