I saw a shooting star after a few minutes however, this shooting star did something impossible:  it stopped its direction after a second and hovered for a fraction of a second and then it shot off in a totally different direction at a 90-degree angle shot across the sky and vanished.

Loud, typical ufo sound was heard.;2018-12-17 01:30:00;5 minutes;Loud, typical ufo sound was heard. I heard a noice like the typical ufo sound (dwound-dwound repeating) like an orbiting/spinning sound, but it was louder than any other plane I’ve ever heard (though a helicopter is louder than what I heard).  I only noticed it instantly because I wasn’t paying much attention because I was tired.  I don’t know if the noice faded in or if it was instant.  It was loud when I first noticed it but then it got quieter as it went farther away, then it became louder (not as loud as when I noticed it) right before getting quieter again till the noice faded away completely.  I heard the noice for up to 5 minutes. I did not make an effort to look outside.  I’ve heard this noice multiple times over the years but this time it was much louder than normal.  The noice has potential of coming from maybe a big military shipment plane (like a bomber?) but then again, I’m throwing out random guesses.;38.0976761904762;-122.569730952381
