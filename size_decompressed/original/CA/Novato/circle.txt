UFO in Novato CA 3/20/07 9:27 pm;2007-03-20 21:27:00;15 seconds;UFO in Novato CA 3/20/07 9:27 pm I was gazing out my upstairs bathroom window and noticed how bright and brilliant the stars looked.  A crystal clear evening I could see the big dipper and Venus in full view.  All of a sudden I saw a slow moving sphere moving in direct alignment of Venus gliding North across the sky.  I thought it was a small plane because there is a small airplane strip here in Novato.  This was somehow slower moving and larger than a private plane or jet.  The color was different as well.  At first it looked white then as it moved closer across the sky toward where I was viewing,it became reddish or like an amber color.  It got bigger and brighter and just as I started to think that's not a plane.....it started to fade and I mean fade in a hurry.  IWithin 3 seconds it just faded and vanished into thin air. I started yelling at my husband that I saw something and didn't know what happened to the moving light/object.  Did my eyes distort or was I imagining it?  That was my skeptical self talking.  I wanted to make something real out of what I just saw.  No, I witnessed an unidentified flying object that glided across the sky, silently and disappeared before my eyes.  I left an email with my local news station asking if anyone else had witnessed what I did. It happened so fast and it's seared in my memory.  I'll never forget it.;38.0976761904762;-122.569730952381
