Looked up and saw what appeared to be a gigantic V shaped object.  Felt that copter(s) were escorting it.  The V shaped object made no noise.  Direction should take it over San Francisco.  No flashing lights on craft or copter(s).  All lights were very dim.  V shape was difficult to make out but was very big.  The last light of the evening was visible on the northwest horizon.  Craft headed southeast. My age is 53.  I am sober (or thought I was after witnessing this thing).  One of my enjoyments is looking up at the sky day or night and watching aircraft going over.  This was NOT the usual.  I am still shaken by it.;38.0976761904762;-122.569730952381

TRIANGULAR GLIDER, no propulsion noise, very fast.;2007-09-02 21:30:00;5 minutes;TRIANGULAR GLIDER, no propulsion noise, very fast. moved very quickly, too low to be a prop plane, no jet noise. More of a glider. All air traffic had been diverted from area due to laser light show at Stafford Lake. So planes were not in this area. Had three lights on back and you could make out a triangular shape. Saw this same craft 6 months ago in Petaluma, CA before I moved to Novato.;38.0976761904762;-122.569730952381
