I walked on my drivway to the end of the drivway, I looked up in the sky.I saw a orange round light moving from my left to my right.  It was bigger then a plane and was moving at A somewhat slow speed.  I looked at it for apx. 10 seconds.   While I was watching it, I pulled out my cell phone and walked another 10 feet to get out from under a street light.I started filming the orange  light, I could see the orange light on my phone then after another 5 to 10 seconds there was light comming from under the orange light.  These lights came in the shape of an upside down funnel.  The colors of these lights were a greenish, blueish, yellowish, whiteish in color.   As I was watching the lights, the orange light just disappeared.  I countinued to watch the lights and then the lights seem to dissipate, and after a few more seconds all the lights were gone. I went back into my house and drew a sketch of what I saw.I then contacted a local T.V. station channel 5 and asked them if anyone else reported seeing what I saw. They contacted me later by email and asked me if I would explane what I had seen,I said yes and a reporter came apx.1 hour later.  Before they came I called the local police station and asked if anyone reported seeing any lights over Novato.  I also sent a email to the U F O center. the reporter came and filmed me, while I explaned what I had seen.Shortly after that I recieved a call from someone from the U.F.O.Center.  I had the reporter record the phone message from my phone from the U.F.O.Center.  I called back to the center and followed his instruction to file a report. I don't know what I saw,  it was there;38.0976761904762;-122.569730952381
