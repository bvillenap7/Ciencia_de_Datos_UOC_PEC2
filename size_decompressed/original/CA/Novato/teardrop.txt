Three objects equal distance from each other following same course.;2004-09-22 06:45:00;5 minutes;Three objects equal distance from each other following same course. White object, side teardrop shape or something I would describe more comet-like with tail.  It suddently appeared in early morning sky just as sun began to rise.  Object moved verly slowly.  A second object appeared in exact spot where the first had appeared and followed the same directional course as the first.  I watched both with binoculars as well as spotting scope but could not determine what they were.  A third object appeared in the exact initial spot as both the first and second objects at an equal distance from the second object as the second was from the first.  The third object followed the exact course of direction as the first two. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.0976761904762;-122.569730952381
