Saw two mutilated adult cattle disposed for pickup in little-travelled area;2000-02-16 12:30:00;not applicable;Saw two mutilated adult cattle disposed for pickup in little-travelled area Driving to work 12:30 p.m. Feb. 16 saw two adult cattle and two calves disposed for pickup on the roadside near a dairy farm. The location was on Sunset Ave. between Howard and Weir roads about 300 yards west of Howard. I have two photos. The appearance was like the many mutilation photos I have seen. I commute 80 miles per day (rt) on rural road and see many dead animals. This is the real deal. The two adults both had circular cuts in the anal-genital areas. The udder are of one cow was removed. The stomach was visible and the viscera possibly was removed or consumed. Perhaps you can contact some interested in this who can contact the farmer or myself. Although I work as newspaper reporter, this is not the type of story I normally cover. I usually work with sources who are known to me and/or familiar with the publication, and I am not interested in investigating something like this myself, although I am very interested in these kind of subject. I will observe that one has followed the topic you deal with, it is transforming, and a little scary also, to see something known only through published or broadcast accounts firsthand.;37.3312;-120.8794
