Unknown amber light moving north to south;2009-11-13 21:30:00;1 .5 Min;Unknown amber light moving north to south We saw an oval Amber light traveling North to South. It was approx 100 foot of the ground. We were within 1/4 mile of it. It flew in a straight line, no rising or weaving. It was traveling 25 - 30 MPH. There was no sound . The shape never changed. I expected to see red lights on its tail, but it never changed shape or color. My wife is a school bus driver of 50. I am a business owner .  Doing grading and paving, 49 years old. We have never seen anything like this and joked about people who have. We do not use drugs. We were in the hot tub when this happened.I asked my wife to look then stepped out of the hot tub and around the side of our house to keep an eye on it.Then had to run to the other side of the deck to keep watching it fly south. The light wasn't bright. The ground did not light up. It was about as bright as an amber parking lot light from a few hundred feet away. But this one moved at 25 - 30 MPH and went from just north of Hickman to beyond wher! e we could see to the south.;37.6155;-120.7016
