Triangular object with three LARGE, white lights seen on Easter night;2003-04-20 21:07:00;6-10 seconds;Triangular object with three LARGE, white lights seen on Easter night Standing on the beach at 9:07 pm I noticed lights moving across the sky.  I looked up to see a single triangular craft with 60 degree angles, rounded corners and three LARGE(each light was at least 1/10 the size of the entire craft) white lights located on the bottom of the object centered toward each corner.  The object followed a near straight path from South to North about 1,000 ft. up and just off the Pacific coast.  It seemed to be moving faster than a commercial jet, but was two to three times as large, and made no sound that I could hear.  It had no visible wings or tail, but flew with the triangle pointed in the direction of flight.  I am 22 years old. Male.  I got my associates degree two years ago.  I have lived in California the past 2 years.;33.0187;-117.2798
