This sounds crazy, but I SAW THEM!!! It was overcast that night. i was up late, smoking cigarettes in my car just out front of my apartment complex, listening to the radio.  i looked up to the eastern sky facing north and saw objects, hundreds of feet up in the air, hovering just above the lowest border of the cloud covering, giving off light within the fog!!!  they just stood there. there were four altogether that i could see, one in the middle, glowing brighter, with blue and red noticeable around it, while three others almost were encircling the other. they stood there. they couldnt have been stars because NONE were visible that night (the sky was BLANKETED with low-lying clouds), and they couldn't have been planes because they wouldn't move!!! though i could swear the one in the middle would almost rock back and forth, left and right, for only just the briefest of moments. first i was intoxicated with what i thought i might possibly be seeing! UFOs! Holy Shit! then a flood of panic came over me and i began to worry, realizing that this wasn't something most people should see, nor believe in. but here i was, seeing it! i walked quickly back inside, unsure what to believe anymore. so i write to you.;37.8567;-122.0218
