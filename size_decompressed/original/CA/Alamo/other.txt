Oval shape close to the ground in residential area;2014-06-25 22:54:00;1 minute;Oval shape close to the ground in residential area I was standing outside my house, and I heard a very loud noise and an oval shape hovering in the sky.  It was moving slowly, so I watched it thinking it was an airplane too close to the ground.  But after about 45 seconds the craft suddenly disappeared.  It had 5 very light blue lights.;37.8567;-122.0218
