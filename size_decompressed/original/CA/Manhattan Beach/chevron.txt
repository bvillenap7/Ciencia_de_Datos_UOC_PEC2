Flight of 6 cheveron shaped craft .;2001-04-24 21:25:00;8 seconds;Flight of 6 cheveron shaped craft . These craft were observed from my roof top deck. I was lying in my hot tub and gazing up at the night sky. Suddenly a flight of 6 objects flying in a east by north east direction (approximate heading 080) at a fairly high rate of speed appeared at about 70 degrees azimuth to me. I live on the coastline, so the craft were coming in from over the ocean. No idea of altitude, but high enough where I could not see any detail on the craft. All craft appeared to be exactly the same. The craft gave off a faint whitish glow (a slight cast of yellow), just enought to make them visible. The craft were in perfect separation. After passing overhead, three of the craft broke off and changed heading to approx. 070. The other three maintained course for approx. 1-2 seconds, then joined up on the first three. Perfect separation was maintained at all times. No sound was heard. The craft dissappeared several seconds later, still headed approx. 070. At first I thought they were birds, then jets, since I used to fly jets in the service (A-4's). What got me was the sudden brake off movement of the first three, with no roll movement observed when they changed course. They seemed to simply translate over, for want of a better word. Also the speed seemed very high, and the separation was too perfect. I have seen many flight demonstration teams, but nothing like that. Flying that type of perfect formation would be very difficult for a military jet. Also, some sort of roll movement is required to change heading that quickly. Very strange.;33.8899;-118.4008
