Beautiful clear late afternoon along the strand by the beach heading south towards the manhattan beach pier.;2013-07-09 17:30:00;10 minutes;I was going for a walk on a beautiful clear late afternoon along the strand by the beach heading south towards the manhattan beach pier when I saw a dark grey object in the distance.  It looked to be over the water and near the cliffs of palos verdes estates which was approximately five miles south from me.  At first I thought not much of it and thought it was a blimp but then I wondered what a blimp would be doing in that area, especially at such a low altitude (1,000 feet approximately).  I hoped to get a better view of the object when I was on the pier and sadly I did not have my camera,  I often take my camera with me for sunset but on this day I went earlier than normal on my evening walk.   I dismissed the blimp idea and still wondered what it was and then the object looked like two grey balloons side by side but this was not a hot air balloon or two.   As I neared the pier the object moved at a good speed towards the land and by the time I got to the pier I could not see the object, it was as if it had disappeared into the palos verdes peninsula hillside above the cliffs.   I searched for the object for many more minutes but could not see it at all.   I have been interested in UFO's for twenty years and have never seen one and was not thinking UFO at the time at all, I just wanted to know what this object was as it certainly was not a blimp, balloon, cloud, helicopter, plane, etc.   When I heard you speak about the recent flap in UFO's on Rense and then saw the recent LA sightings, I thought I should report it.   As for the size it was at least the size of the goodyear blimp, maybe twice that size.  There were many people about on the beach, strand and pier but I seemed to be the only one noticing this thing,   I wonder if people down south in Redondo Beach and Palos Verdes got a good look at it.;33.8899;-118.4008
