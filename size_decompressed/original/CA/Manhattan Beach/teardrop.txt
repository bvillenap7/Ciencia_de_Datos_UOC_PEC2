Spheres clone then vanish;1997-08-18 19:00:00;10-20 minutes;Spheres clone then vanish At a manhattan beach elementary school which sits on top of a hill a friend and I were filming ourselves perform skateboarding tricks. We skateboarded until the camera's battery died. Afterwards we sat down and took a rest. My friend and I were talking about something when he suddenly said what is that? I looked up from a top the hill to see 3 sphere shaped bright balls in the formation of a triangle. They were moving very slowly, practically stationary and it definetly didn't seem normal. They continued to hover and then another sphere with the same dimensions and the same level of brightness as the other spheres emerged out of one of the original bright spheres. My friend had suggested that it was the apocalypse. Out of the first two original spheres came more spheres, again the same size and brightness. Then out of the clones came out another clone. This kept happening until there were about twelve spheres. The clones then started to form the original triangle pattern which the first three spheres were in. I know others also saw the incident because their were many cars all around that stoped to observe what was happening. The spheres were just as bright as they were before and then one of the spheres sort of flashed and disappeared. The rest of the spheres did the same and disappeared in an instant. We couldn't understand what it was , how they cloned each other and how they  disappeared in an instant. Note: we were observing this incident from a top a hill in manhattan. The incident was occuring close to us within clearly visible distance. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));33.8899;-118.4008
