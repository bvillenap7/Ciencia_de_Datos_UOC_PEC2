Circular pattern lights over Manhattan Beach, CA;2008-09-13 23:35:00;30;Circular pattern lights over Manhattan Beach, CA At about 11:40 p.m. on September 13, 2008, I observed a flying object to the South of my home.  The object appeared to be circular with blue, white and green lights with an intermittent red center.  I woke up my brother and his family who also observed the object for about 20 minutes.  At one point there appeared to be two objects.  The second only being observed for a couple of minutes. My sister-in-law took several pictures.  One captures the shape of what we saw well. All together, five people (two children) observed the object. We viewed it with high powered binoculars.  The photos were taken with an Olympus 18x Zoom SP-550UZ. The objects appeared to be over Hermosa or Redondo Beach, California near the coast. As we observed the objects, they would hover, flip, dive, rise again quickly.  They went in and out of the cloud cover ceiling.  Finally, one descended down and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Photos show a tiny, indistinct point of light, backdropped by a black night sky.
