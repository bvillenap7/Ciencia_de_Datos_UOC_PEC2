Object with changing lights over the Southbay!;2008-02-07 01:25:00;1 hour;Object with changing lights over the Southbay! It was light in the western sky which keep changing colors! At first I thought it was a plane turning or something.....after watching it for awhile I realized was not a plane, helicopter or anything like that! The longer I watched it the more I noticed the erratic movement as if it was dangling by a string. The colors at times seemed to get very bright.  I watched it for over an hour before it made dramatic move and traveled NW at incredible speeds like shooting star! I called a friend who doesn't believe in UFO's to see it and they believe in them now!;33.8899;-118.4008

But I then thought to myself, how could i see a shooting star in broad daylight.  I automatically thought it was a UFO.;33.8899;-118.4008
