Hovering rolling lights.;2001-05-15 00:00:00;10 minutes;Hovering rolling lights. I saw a row of rolling lights suddenly appear and then just hover there. They stayed there for a few minutes and then bolted very fasted to another location and they repeated this action for about ten minutes and then they just disappeared. The lights were blue and green and I really couldn't make out the shape of the craft but it looked as though the lights were circling around the craft. It moved in a way that no known aircraft in this world is capable of moving. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is semi-anonymous.  Exact date may be either 15MY01 or 16MY01.  PD));38.8888;-122.5843
