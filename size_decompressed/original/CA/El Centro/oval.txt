I looked up to the south and observed a huge ball of white/yellow fire (no tail) moving from west to east.  It stayed on a lateral path, never dipping or losing altitude until is quickly went from horizon to horizon just missing Earth.  It was silent and was not burning up at all.  It just moved very quickly in space.  I guessed it was a near earth asteroid, big and fast.  If I extended my arm/hand the size would be about a golf ball to tennis ball in size, huge, dangerous and flying through space, very impressive.  I have been an Art Bell listener since 1994 and always enjoyed your shows with him.  RIP Mr Bell and keep up the good work, Peter.   PS I searched the internet and other sources and there were no other reports from that vicinity.  I imagine NASA was watching is closely and were grateful it never collided with Earth or else this email would be moot.  Thank you.
