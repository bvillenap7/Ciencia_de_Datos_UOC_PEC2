Strange lights over El Centro, CA that do not move;2012-10-14 21:00:00;30 minutes;Strange lights over El Centro, CA that do not move I was on my deck and could see these lights that I assumed were a Border Patrol helicopter, but after 15 minutes it did not move at all. I went inside and got my binoculars, and viewed the object. It seemed circular and the lights seemed to change color and were around it. After 20 minutes I went inside to see if anyone else had made a post about it on the internet. I went back outside and continued to watch it when it got very bright and shot sideways and just vanished. Normally we can hear the helicopters this was silent. I am very used to seeing night crop dusting planes and helicopters this was neither. It just stayed in one place until it moved and disappeared. It was between El Centro and Ocotillo over the mountain range. I almost thought it was a star for awhile but seemed way too low. Just when I had convinced myself it was a star because it was just hovering in one spot it got bright and sped to the right towards the airport. I would have seen it as if it were coming into the airport it would have gotten closer to me. Instead it just went straight in a line and vanished. I sure would like to know what this was.;32.7808000000001;-115.5627
