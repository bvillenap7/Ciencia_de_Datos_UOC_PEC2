As I began to walk the stretch to my house I noticed four lights that were horizontal that I could tell that they were on craft but I could not see the craft. It traveled at a very fast speed. I have never seen anything in my life traveling so fast. The lights were white and they did not flash and no other red lights were present like they appear on airplanes. The shape went over my house and as it traveled over my head I could not hear a sound. It was a dead silence that I could not explain. The lights turned vertical as it was passing by my head. The lights did not break their form. I could tell that the craft just turned and it did not slow down. As I turned my head the craft kept on going and I saw it for another two seconds before the lights went out. I was left with an eerie feeling about what I had just seen.
