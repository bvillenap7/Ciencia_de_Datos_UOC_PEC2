:25 PM + 8:50 PM + 9:15 PM Wed Apr 18, 2012 With bonoculars, saw 3rd sight = FLEET OF UFO;2012-04-18 21:15:00;passing by;:25 PM + 8:50 PM + 9:15 PM Wed Apr 18, 2012 With bonoculars, saw 3rd sight = FLEET OF UFO A bit shaky...At 8:25 PM was looking up at Western Sky here in El Centro, CA and saw something opaque with no defined shape as a could see.  I Stayed there and saw the same thing at 8:50 PM (pacific time)and timed the space between sighting...25 minute apart.  Thinking that maybe this thing would go by I got my bonoculars and persisted to stay VIGILANT of the souther sky.  Sure enough, as nervous as I feel/uneasy, at 9:15 PM I spotted the same mass coming from the south.  By this time I had planned EXACTLY whatI'd do..toss my glasses (I'm near-sighted) on the soft partof the lawn and know exactly at about what altitidue and spot to point the bonoculars. I did just these these and with my bonoculars followed and saw A FLEET OF VERY, VERY, FAST METAL LOOKING OBJECTS!!!!!!!!!!! 8:25 PM + 8:50 PM + 9:15 PM (25 min apart sighting 1 - 2   25 min apart from sighting  2-3.  This is truely frightening.;32.7808000000001;-115.5627
