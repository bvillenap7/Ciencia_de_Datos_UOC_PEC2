From out of a dark sky, out came a craft which seem to extrude from a bright white star, oddly it had no light, it seemed to be illuminated by the sky. No sounds were heard, it flew down  to the top of my neighbors house(5-6 yards away) and sat there (Metal appeared to be attached to pontoon type landing equipment, it had a cylinder shape) as I shined my flashlight at it. The craft stayed from 2-5 minutes It then lifted off and smoothly flew back up to clouds towards the east. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
