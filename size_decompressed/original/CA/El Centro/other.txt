I was standing at a nearby corner, looking up at a no-longer-in-use water tower sitting on the lot next door.  I turned my head northward to watch an east-moving plane--I like to see the tail they leave behind.  I then saw a north traveling object it was moving ever so gently, as if just glidding.  I was so shocked because I observed I was about to witness a mid-air collision.  This very very shiny object, (like shine coming from a high gloss metal like chrome) went: (AS THE JET WAS TRAVELING EAST) 1. North 2. Up and over the jet then under it 3. and Over it again Like a wrapping motion-1 1/2 turns. Then this object that looked like a manta raya traveled towards my direction (in southerly direction. I did not keep my eye off it.  It moved very slowly, gently, swaying very gently towards south-western direction --towards the mexican border.  about an hour later, my mother called me from Laguna Nigeuel in Calif.  She said something like: Honey, put everything down, I need to tell you something I just saw (fm her kitchen window). I stopped her from talking further and told her to stop and let me tell her what I had seen.  We both described the object in the exact manner: a metal object that looked like a manta raya or sting ray, moving very gently, no vapor trail... We know what we saw.  And so did the pilot moving east on this day ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate witness does not indicate year of sighting.  We assume witness means year 2000, but that is a guess.
