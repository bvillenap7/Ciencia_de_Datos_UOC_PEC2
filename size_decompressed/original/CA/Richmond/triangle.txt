White dots forming triangle with one trailing dot. Silent propulsion.;2013-12-21 20:00:00;~30 seconds;White dots forming triangle with one trailing dot. Silent propulsion. Was staring at the moon on a clear, cloudless night. Noticed a light moving towards my field of view. Then noticed there were multiple lights, moving in a triangle shape, with a single light trailing in the center, in a sort of arrow shape. The lights were only a few hundred, maybe a thousand, feet off the ground. It moved relatively slowly considering, and was in my field of view for more than 30 seconds. What makes me certain it was either a UFO or experimental craft of some sort was that it was absolutely silent. There was zero noise detectable from the ground where I was standing. It just silently and smoothly cruised across the sky. I have 20/20 vision, am 29 years old, and am gainfully employed in the IT field. This is the first UFO I have EVER seen. I hereby swear that with the exception of the date and time, which I don't recall exactly, the entirety of this recalling is 100% factual with absolutely no intentional exaggeration whatsoever. My only regrets are my good camera was inside and I had aircraft with which to give chase.;37.9330321428571;-122.337610714286
Triangular shaped object flying in night sky;2020-04-18 21:16:00;8-10 seconds;Triangular shaped object flying in night sky My adult son and I were looking for satellites in the sky from our backyard when all of a sudden we see a triangular shaped object (one light at the front and two in the back in each corner with black mass in between the lights) flying extremely fast across the sky.  He pointed it out and I immediately saw it and we watched it until it was no longer visible. It was flying northwest then disappeared into the night sky.;37.9330321428571;-122.337610714286
