Bright yellow and white glowing sphere motionless for 7-10 minutes, changes shape, disapears;2010-10-13 17:00:00;7-10 minutes;Bright yellow and white glowing sphere motionless for 7-10 minutes, changes shape, disapears Yesterday at around 5:00pm I noticed what looked like a large round object in the sky directly above with the slightest Northwesterly angle when pointing at it. I was lying on my back outside looking skyward when I noticed the round object that appeared to glow a bright yellow and white color. It did not move at all. I showed my wife and 3.5 year old daughter and both saw the object. After watching it for about 7-10 minutes it appeared to get larger in one instant and then about 10 seconds later it disappeared. While looking at it we speculated that it might be a balloon but concluded it was too large. We then wondered if it was a star shining very brightly but we have never seen a star glow so much in the day... it was not a star. I was not going to tell anyone about what we witnessed until by chance I saw photos accompanying a story on AOL.com today of almost the exact same thing yesterday over New York!!!!!!!!!! The moment I saw the photos I had a rush of adrenaline and a became a little spooked because of the extreme similarity to our experience yesterday. My wife had nightmares all night...
