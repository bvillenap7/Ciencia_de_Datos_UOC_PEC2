Thought it was a plane, but it stopped moving.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));2017-05-13 04:30:00;45 minutes;Thought it was a plane, but it stopped moving. Came out on my front porch after waking up.  Noticed what I thought was a plane in the distance, looked like it had red lights on its under side but then when I looked again it just stopped.  It got brighter, almost like it pulsed but then it dimmed down again.   I woke my husband up, he couldn't figure it out either.  It's been sitting in the same spot for almost an hour over Albany.  It's far too bright, and low, to be a star.;37.9330321428571;-122.337610714286
