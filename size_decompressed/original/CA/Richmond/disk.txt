Disk over Richmond, CA;1998-04-15 20:00:00;10 minutes;Disk over Richmond, CA On or about April 14, 1998   Late in the evening my sister& I were star gazing.  Almost immediately a single bright orb  floated abruptly above us.  At first it looked as if it could be a satellite, but I asked my sister: Do you see that strange light centered almost directly above us?  We were also with a mutual friend. Upon their agreement, we started to get freaked out.  We all agreed and felt strongly we had seen an unidentified flying object. It was watching us watch it.  When we jumped up to go  inside to get a camera, it had already disappeared.  TARA HILLS CITY, CENTRAL CALIFORNIA,  LOCAL BAY AREA..;37.9330321428571;-122.337610714286
One set of cylindrical lights seen above 580 West;2007-04-13 20:35:00;10 min;One set of cylindrical lights seen above 580 West While returning from the Oakland Airport, I was driving along 580 towards the Richmond Bridge, when in the sky there appeared some type of cylindrical object of flashing lights.  I first saw this object in the sky while passing the IKEA in Emeryville, CA.  The object was stationary, but far in the distance. The lights I saw were clearly in motion, moving in a circular pattern, but in a pattern that varied from a solid circular pattern of uniform shaped lights, to certain areas flashing while other areas are black. If it had lasted only a minute, I may have ignored it, but this went on for more than ten minutes, and as I moved along 580, it was clear I was approaching the object.  While I originally thought it stationary, it must have moved at some point because I lost eye contact with it for approximately 2 minutes, then it came back into sight.  I cannot say the exact place I passed the object, but it was on my right-hand side, somewhere nearby the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Park. Shortly after I passed where I thought it was above, I saw what I thought was a helicopter moving towards the location from the Southwest.  By the time I reached the Richmond Bridge, I had seen an additional 3 helicopters in the area.;37.9330321428571;-122.337610714286
