Lights over Richmod.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-04 21:29:00;30 minutes;Lights over Richmond While looking at the stars in the direction to the west. I noticed an object to small to be an aircraft without running lights.  I pointed to the object and my girlfriend and we watched it move across the sky. It then stopped immediately and went in the opposite direction, stopped again and went back to the original direction.  At that moment another object appeared from the same location as the original and it began what looked like a chase with the first object.  Then another appeared following the first two, then another.  They all moved from West to North/West.  We scanned the skyâ€™s with our eyes to find them but they moved out of sight. Every few minutes we would find another really faint light moving across the sky at incredible speed for how far away it appeared to be. I would say they were all out of the outer atmosphere. We stayed out on the roof for another 20 minutes only to see one at least ever few minutes. Most moving in different directions. Eventu! ally we went inside , not because of the lack of sightings but because of the length of the sighting. The best part is that we have one very clearly breaking the laws of physics all on camera.;37.9330321428571;-122.337610714286
