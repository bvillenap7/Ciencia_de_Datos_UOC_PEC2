odd sighting at Mount Wilson;1989-09-20 16:00:00;30 seconds;odd sighting at Mount Wilson My husband and I were descending from Mount Wilson in the San Gabriel Forest.  I was in the passenger seat, and idly gazing at the passing scenery.  There were multiple ridges, and out of nowhere an object appeared.  It was quite large, shaped like a helicopter -- except the body was out of normal proportion.  There were no rotors, and no discernible noise.  It was of a dark color, and It seemed to glide.  As I noticed it , I turned to my husband and exclaimed -- but by the time we both looked back it was behind another ridge and no longer visible. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date is flawed.  We have amended the date to a date in 1989, assuming that is the year that the witness intended to indicate.  PD));34.1618;-118.0527
