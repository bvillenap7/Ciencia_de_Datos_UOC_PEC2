Cluster sighting of UFO north of Sierra Madre, CA over the San Gabriel mountains.;2012-10-14 13:37:00;3 minutes;Cluster sighting of UFO north of Sierra Madre, CA over the San Gabriel mountains. Encountered the formation of object approximately 12 or more while looking up at the North North Eastern sky. Weather condition was absolutely clear with blue skies. Notice the formation when tracking a plane flying roughly NorthWest.  The plane was a few thousand miles high above the San Gabriel Mountains at approximately at a 30-40 degree angle in the sky from my vantage point   At first I thought it was a flock of birds but realized they were further from me than the sighted plane and could not have been birds. My wife who was with me confirmed the sighting. Initially it formed a wavy chain formation and moved in a westerly direction across the sky.  The objects appeared to be reflective and seemed to move relative to each other. The formation stopped their movement when they were roughly due north from my line of sight and formed a circular cluster. Some of the objects in the middle of the cluster appeared to rotate and catch the light from the sun. It appears that the objects, because of this behavior, were faceted.  The reflected the light from the sun in unison. I tracked the objects for about 3 mins. and at one point asked two women who were siting next to me to confirm that they could see the objects. The formation seemed to appear larger suggesting that they stopped moving in a westerly direction and started moving south.  I turned to the woman to ask her the time and when I turned back to see them, they objects had vanished from view. Objects made no sound and appeared in my estimation to be several thousand feet high. Curious if anybody else had this sighting.;34.1618;-118.0527
