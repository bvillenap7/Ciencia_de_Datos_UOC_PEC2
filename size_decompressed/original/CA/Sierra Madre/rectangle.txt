Two rows of parallel flashing lights on a vehicle as large as a blimp;2008-07-06 22:00:00;1 to 2 mins;Two rows of parallel flashing lights on a vehicle as large as a blimp This was going directly westward, approximately over the Interstate 210 freeway, south of Sierra Madre, California.  There were two parallel rows of light at an 11 to 5 o'clock angle to my position.  These lights, apparently, were on the same flying vehicle.  The lights could have been on a vehicle as large as a blimp, but the two parallel lines of light were straight and perfectly parallel to each other.  As it flew, there were small individual lights comprising each row of lights.  These individual lights would rapidly flash off and on for about a second, then refrain from flashing at all for another second.  This pattern continually occurred.  It was about as high as one would see a Sesna small plane fly.  I first saw it from my kitchen window, then I quickly ran outside and heard no sound from it.  It was going about as fast as a Sesna might fly.;34.1618;-118.0527
