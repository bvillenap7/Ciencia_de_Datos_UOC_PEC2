When we stopped the truck to look at it we saw that it was moving at the pace of a normal airplane. As we watched we saw a light come off of it, if the object was a millimeter in size the light that came off of it was about 4 to 5 millimeters. In the light that came off, there was a series of blinking lights inside the light. The light with the blinking lights in it lasted about 10 seconds both times it happened. The object made a strange sound. It kind of sounded like an electric engine. I know that it was the object making the sound because there were no other airplanes around. We wathched the light start to slow down almost to a stop then it disappered. My friend and I were driving home around 1:30am when I saw a bright orange light in the the sky. From my town we can see airplanes that are approaching Burbank Airport, so we see a lot of airplane activity. The object caught my eye because it did'nt look like any of the airplanes I've seen fly by. It did'nt have any of the blinking safty lights that the other planes have. I pulled my truck over to get a better look. When I got out I noticed the object flew about the same speed as the airplanes we see. As we watched the object a beam of light came off of it. Within the light, there were a row of blinking lights that we could not see before. If the object was a millimeter in size the light that came off was about 4-5 millimeters in length. This happened twice. Each time it lasted about 10 seconds. We jumped back into my truck to move becuase we were parked under a street light we wanted to go to a darker place to get a better look. We drove to my friends house which was about 100 yards away from the spot where we first saw it. When we got out of the truck we noticed the object made a strange electrical type sound. I know it was the object making the sound beacuse there were no other aircraft around. As we watched the object we noticed it started to slow down to a very slow speed. Right when it seemed like the object was going to come to a stop it disappered. I called the local police and the airport to see if any one else reported it. Each said no.;34.2679;-118.3399
Pulsing light in sky.;2017-08-13 21:32:00;5 minutes;Pulsing light in sky. 8/13/2017 @ 9:32 p.m. Observing the sky for Perseid meteorites and noticed a light pulse above the Angeles Crest.  I kept staring at the same spot to see if it would pulse again, and sure enough, 10 to 15 seconds later, another pulse.   I called my son out to make sure I wasn’t imagining things and he confirmed what I was seeing.  This continued 32 times.  The light pulse was less that a second and varied in brightness each time.  It traveled from west to the east and its path spanned approximately 15 degrees within 5 minutes time then finally stopped.   I’ve seen many satellite fly overs but nothing like this.  Can’t figure this one out???;34.2679;-118.3399
String of lights appearing in sky.   ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-26 20:20:00;3-5 minutes;String of lights appearing in sky. On 03/26/2020 at 8:20 PM I witnessed small lights that appeared to be coming from the same spot in the sky. The lights flew North/ East towards the Angeles Crest mountains at a very high speed and altitude. They were spaced about 6 to 8 seconds apart and continued to appear for a duration of roughly 5 minutes. The last 3 that appeared didn't fly straight with the others. The 2 before the last one stopped and spaced themselves while the last one appeared and flew a very tight J to gather with the other 2 lights to form a triangle. The lights hovered in that formation for about 3 seconds then separated back into a straight line and continued to follow the other lights.;34.2679;-118.3399
