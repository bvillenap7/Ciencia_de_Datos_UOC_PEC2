While at home in bed and watching TV my eye caught this flickering light from out the window.  I turned and looked at the light and figured it was a hovering helicopter.  I placed the TV on mute and could not hear it.  So I ignored it for a while when the object kept on glimmering with three colors White, Red and Green.  So I got out of bed and grabbed my pair of high-power Binos and went outside.  I focused in on the object which was maybe 10 miles away, North-East.  It looked like a Disco light, High Alt. maybe 5 - 7 thousand feet AGL.   I fingered it was a star because it was not moving and is was a hot night and just glimmered from the heat.   Then suddenly it was gone.  The light was out.....!  Strange.....1230 AM and no airports in that Direction....No sound either....However Edwards AFB is 60 miles to the North of me.;34.2679;-118.3399
