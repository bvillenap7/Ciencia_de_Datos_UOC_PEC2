The Contrail on the west was a standard straight line. The contrail on the east was the so called donuts on a rope ,or Aurora type. They were spotted within high cirrus cloud formation. Sorry, no pix. Not much more to report. Contrails were white in color, appeared to not have much distance between them ( 1/2 mile perhaps ), were very visible and stable for as much as 40 minutes. My wife and I observed this from our back yard. We both have prior experiences with unexplained phenomena.;34.2679;-118.3399
