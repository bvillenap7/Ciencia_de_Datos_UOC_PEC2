Over High Desert slightly before 9:00 pm, observed 2 large orange lights fly towards each other and converge.  Parked to watch and a third came to join them.  They remained (?) stationary and then disappeared.  Reappeared a couple of seconds later and then another joined, and then another till there was approximately 10 large lights in a row.  It then seemed to take on a very large ?saucer-type shape with the lights still going around.  A last light was approaching appearing to join, and the whole thing just disappeared leaving the last lone light for a while longer, which then disappeared.;34.4308073170732;-117.551934146341
