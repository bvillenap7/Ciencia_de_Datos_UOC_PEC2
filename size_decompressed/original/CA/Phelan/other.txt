Calif.) Mr. D.F. was outside in his yard when he looked up and noticed a huge, slow moving, black cigar-shaped object with wings coming from the Lake Arrowhead area of the San Bernardino Mountains.  The object continued to travel east over the high desert towards the direction of Las Vegas.  He decided to try and follow it in his car to see if he could get a closer look but lost the object after about 10-15 minutes.  He said the object just disappeared.  *(We are fairly certain that this is the same object reported by the other witness in Highland a few minutes earlier who had sighted it from the south side of the SB Mountains)* NUFORC Note:  Thank you, Cinde.));34.4308073170732;-117.551934146341
Animals went into a trance when a UFO came Into view.;2017-12-02 19:00:00;60 seconds;Animals went into a trance when a UFO came Into view. I was riding horses with my partner and as the sun was about 30 minutes from setting the horses stop, and stare to the east.  My partner noticed the object first and pointed it out to me.  All the other animals on the property were also watching (8 horses 3 dogs and 2 goats).  I gave my horse a gesture to move but she wasn't going to, and I wasn't really worried about the horse. As soon as I see it there is no doubt in my mind it's a UFO.  It was about 5 miles away, and didn't fly quite as high as planes in the area normally do.  It was black in color, had a sphere on top with a diameter of about 20 feet, and a spike pointing downward extending about 40-50 feet with 3 rings that seemed to be floating around the spike. I reached for my phone to take a picture while my partner was calling a friend in the area to see if he could see it.  After I opened my camera app on my phone and look bake at the object it was gone.  Since the incident I've been searching the internet unsuccessfully for the same object.  So this is my last attempt to find out if anyone else has ever seen this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.4308073170732;-117.551934146341
