I was watching TV and, out of the corner of my view through a window, I saw a bright light. I thought VAFB was doing another launch. I went outside and observed that it was not a missile (not the usual engine rumble and the trajectory was wrong). The aircraft was moving south at a good clip but not anything super fast, and it wasn’t rotating. I kept watching as it flew directly over my home. It was dark so I could not gage altitude, but I would guess under a thousand feet. It seemed to have a round cylindrical shape, with red and green lights. I was thinking it was an airplane-- it had to be, but with no engine noise? I saw what looked like a shooting star just to its left and thought that was a strange coincidence then, I saw another. I tracked it until it was over the city of Lompoc then I saw it stop. A white light was coming from the top. This light had a strange look though. Instead of just a solid light it looked like it was a very fast strobing light. I was considering it might be some experimental, Air force thing. Then I saw what appeared to be an aircraft with a single white light coming from the direction of the VAFB flight line (that aircraft made a jet engine noise) and was headed toward the floating craft.  The first craft then resumed its clip heading down the coast followed by the other craft until I lost sight of both. I've lived on or around AFB’s for over 40 yrs and never have I witnessed anything like this, so I just wanted to tell someone.  I’m curious if anyone else saw any thing odd tonight?   Well, maybe I’m nuts and it was just my imagination.  Thanks UFO guys.;34.6667373333334;-120.446889333333
