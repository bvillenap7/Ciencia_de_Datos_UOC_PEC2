Very bright large object turning, slowing and climbing at high speed;2013-02-08 18:28:00;~10 minutes;very bright large object turning, slowing and climbing at high speed I was standing outside facing northwest looking at the sky when I noticed a very bright object coming into my right lone of site.  Thought it a aircraft at first, then maybe Jupiter.  I could see jupiter above and behind me so this was not Jupiter.  I then watched the object and saw itno navigation lights just big as Jupiter and much brighter.  Object was moving slowly and I checked 2 make sure it was moving.   Object then appeared to make a sweeping left turn and then another back on prior course.  Object then began 2 climb and as it climbed I could see other aircraft beneath it in the distance.  I watched it till it disappeared.  It was so bright I could see it out a very long way and guess it was visible for at least ten minutes.  Visibility was clear with some clouds far to the north east.
