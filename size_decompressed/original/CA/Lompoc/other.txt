As I rounded a bend in the road between the hills I saw a huge black net like mass about 300 ft off the ground.  It appeared to be undulating like a piece of cloth underwater.  My first thought was that it was some type of netting material possibly dropped from one of the aircraft from Vandenberg air force base.  Then I noticed that it was neither descending or ascending, just floating and slowly moving forward. The whole time moving and rippling as if underwater.  I pulled off to the side of the road as did a few other vehicles and continued to watch it for about five minutes.   I had no  camera or any way to document it.
