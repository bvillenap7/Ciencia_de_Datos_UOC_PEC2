While I was sitting on the couch at work I heard a horrible loud humming noise. It got louder.  As I went outside I noticed the lights started to flicker. Across the street there it was. Heading Northwest slowly. It was diamond shaped-not rectangle. With 4 white lights at each corner. I could see it very clearly. Like it had a aura around it. There was a white in the middle. Looked like the shape of a backwards C. I was black or dark gray.  After about 8 minutes I couldn't see it anymore. I called my boyfriend and woke him up. He ran outside with me still on the phone. I saw it. I could hear that horrible noise over the phone. We were and are both in shock. About 7 to 10 minutes later I heard another humming noise. Sounded like a airplane, but just to be sure I went outside again. I believe it was a C-5. Heading the same direction as the Unidentified Flying Object.;34.6667373333334;-120.446889333333
