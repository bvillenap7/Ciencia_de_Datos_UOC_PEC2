I was standing outside looking for the moon when i saw bright red and orange lights darting really fast across the sky. then it went back and forth and up really fast then it dissapeared into the fog. Then like 2 minutes later IT CAME BACK and was doin the same thing so I tried to call my boyfriend and as his voice mail message came on and my phone got really staticky and I almost lost reception. then the lights and stuff shot strait out dissapeared again and when it dissapeared my phone stopped being staticky and i had clear reception again. It hasnt come back this time.;34.6667373333334;-120.446889333333
