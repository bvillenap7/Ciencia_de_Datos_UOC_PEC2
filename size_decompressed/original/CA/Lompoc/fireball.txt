huge bright orange sphere appeared and dissapeared;2010-01-10 20:00:00;6 sec;huge bright orange sphere appeared and dissapeared My Wife and I were walking the dog about 20:00hrs on Sunday 10 Jan 2010, when I spotted a very large orange glowing ball with a tail coming from it, I pointed look to her and she saw it also.  What was weird about it was very large and was headed in up direction and seem to disappear in the atmosphere.  Lasted about 3 to 6 Seconds.  I was mad because, I just plugged in my cell phone to charge it @ home, and I usually have it with me.  I consider myself an amateur astronomer, I never seen a meteor go in the up direction.  It could have been the direction we saw it. My first thoughts it was a launch from VAFB base,  There is no launches that night.  Iâ€™ve seen meteors, comets, satellites, Rocket launches before and this was different.  The size is what amazed me. Anyway cool site. Will always have camera on my night walks now.;34.6667373333334;-120.446889333333
