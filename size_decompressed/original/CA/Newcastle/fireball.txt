Bright green fireball comes close, but no explosion.;2000-08-18 23:23:00;3 seconds;Bright green fireball comes close, but no explosion. While driving from Reno down I 80 at 11:23 p.m. my attention was caught by a brilliant, bright green fireball. Trailing it briefly were orange sparks. It came in at a 35 deg. angle, down, from the North West. It seemed awful close and I expected to see an explosion since it was still bright when close to the earth. Was also witness by 2 other people in my group, that were in different cars. They also commented on the closeness of the object.;38.8733;-121.1397
