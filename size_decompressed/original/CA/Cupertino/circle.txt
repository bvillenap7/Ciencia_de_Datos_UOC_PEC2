black dot rapidly flying across the sky in silicon valley.;2007-05-19 10:30:00;30 seconds;black dot rapidly flying across the sky in silicon valley. Object first appear to be a floating balloon.  Round in shape floating in a straight line but then I realized that it was flying against the win so it couldn't have been a balloon, plus it flew in a straight line and didn't waver like a balloon would have.  It was flying very fast and crossed the sky until it was out of sight in maybe 20 seconds.  I realize this is a fairly non-descript report but I watch the skies a lot and this was definitely out of the usual.;37.3177000000001;-122.0438
