Metalic ball floating motionless in high winds over San Jose, CA.;1996-10-01 17:00:00;10 mins;Metalic ball floating motionless in high winds over San Jose, CA. I was driving down the interstate between San Jose, CA and Cupertino, CA on a day that looked like it was going to storm and there were very high winds.  I looked at the sky because the clouds were so menacing and saw a stationary spherical object staying motionless about 1000 feet up in the sky as if were on a tether, but it was much too windy for that. The object reminded me of an old World War II floating mine--a metal ball with sticks protruding out from it. It was defenitely metallic, and was so shocking to see that I pulled off the freeway and watched it for about 10 minutes trying to figure out what it was.  It eventually moved away and up into the clouds fairly slowly until I could no longer see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Bright spherical object streaking west to east in skys over San Jose;2008-08-29 22:15:00;1-2 seconds;Bright spherical object streaking west to east in skys over San Jose My son and I were sleeping in a tent in our backyard.  The top of the tent was a screen and the skies were perfectly clear.   At 10:15PM while looking up I saw what appeared to be a spherical object probably 1/8 size of the moon streak across the sky going west to east.  It was not a shooting star and there was too much shape to it to be an Irridium flair.   It had a very white magnesium/titanium color to it.  It was almost blindingly bright.   Absolutely no noise.   It seemed much closer to the ground than jets and other aircraft that I saw in the sky throughout the night.;37.3177000000001;-122.0438
