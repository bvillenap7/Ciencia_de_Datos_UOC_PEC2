One night I could not sleep, and so I was looking outside my window from the couch I slept on at my grandparents.   All of a sudden, I saw 2 pairs of lights, just in the sky.  I thought they were aircraft or helicopters, but as they were the only thing to keep me occupied, I continued to watch.  Suddenly, the lights began to move in patterns, and make turns that no modern aircraft could possibly do.   They then began to periodically rise and descend at will, eventually after a hour of watch, they vanished.  I was too fear stricken to move to document this.
