saw an object hover flash 2 times and completely dissapear;2000-08-16 23:10:00;5 minutes;saw an object hover flash 2 times and completely dissapear while overlooking yorba linda off cliff off of Weir Canyon,(WE WERE EXACTLY LOCATED BY THE GLASS HOUSE YOU SEE OFF THE 91 FREEWAY GOING TOWARDS CORONA) my boyfriend and i were watching the stars when 2 bright yellow ones randomely appeared not to far away, the smaller one was hovering above the other moving rapidly up down left right ,the object had yellow lights flashing around it . at first the objects did not move and we thought they were planes landing however the smaller one completely dissapeard and the larger one began hovering quickly in our direction. i was frozen in shock and couldnt move out of fear, it looked as though it was literally coming right to that area. (it is a large empty lot where some go sight seeing)both of us got goosebumps and he had jumped up and said we need to get out of here right now. go go! we grabbed the blanket and began running towards his car which was parked across the street. the object had yellow lights flashing around it and as i looked back to see where it had gone i watched the object flash once a small yellow light and then flash again a bigger one and completely dissapeared in thin air.. with size of the object and how lit it was neither of us could explain it.we got in the car and drove home as fast as we could , we watched the sky but had not seen anything else after the bigger one dissapeared.;33.893163095238;-117.748259920635
