Comet-like object with a white light and contrail.;2005-09-22 19:30:00;30 seconds;Comet-like object with a white light and contrail. Arriving at our dinner destination, we observed a circular light in the air with a large contrail behind. The contrail was visible for a mile or two with the suns light reflecting off it. It seemed to be flying eradictly and then disappeared into the clouds like it ran out of gas. ((NUFORC Note:  Vandenberg AFB missile launch.  PD));33.893163095238;-117.748259920635

Bright light moving silently and beyond our capabilities.;2010-08-30 20:40:00;5 minutes;Bright light moving silently and beyond our capabilities. Noticed it while I was walking my dog.  Bright light above the houses across the street from my own.  Moved at varying speeds and multiple directions.  It also slowed to a stop and hovered.  Absolutely no sound.     From a distance the light looked white.  As it got closer it appeared to be blue/green.  Could see normal air traffic flying above and behind it.  This really gave a good sense of the speed and maneuverability of the object.   This was the second time I have seen this object.  This time I caught it on video.

Bright star-like white light visible under dense white marine layer, stationary for ten minutes, then gone.;2010-09-21 07:08:00;10 minutes;Bright star-like white light visible under dense white marine layer, stationary for ten minutes, then gone. Bright, star-like light held stationary under dense white marine layer for ten minutes and then vanished. I suspected it to be an optical illusion caused by a streetlamp blocks away that hadn't blinked out yet with the others.  However, its position was too high and no posts were nearby.  It was too large, bright, and stationary to be a helicopter. Not calling it a object or craft - just a light.

Small craft with white light vanishes.;2013-06-22 21:00:00;10 minutes;Small craft with white light vanishes. Myself, my husband and two kids were standing in front of our house.  We had been outside for quite a while. I noticed a light(no color) in the sky flying from West to East.  I watched it closely because it was not flashing like an airplane or helicopter.  As it got closer we noticed there was no motor sound coming from this object.  It was completely silent.  It was about the size of a Cessna although judging size is very difficult.  As it passed over our heads and headed farther East it seemed to move a little bit out of its flight pattern and then the light on this object slowly dimmed and went out and we were just standing there puzzled wondering where it went?  I have seen this same thing in the past but never reported it.  This time it has forced me to report it.  We have also seen formations with about eight craft just white lights flying over our our city moving very slow, no flashing.;33.893163095238;-117.748259920635
