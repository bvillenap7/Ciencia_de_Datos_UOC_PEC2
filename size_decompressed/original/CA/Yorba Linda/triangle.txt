((NUFORC Note:  Vandenberg AFB missile launch.  PD))  Boomerang shaped object with bright light emanating from the rear of the craft.;2005-09-22 19:30:00;2 minutes;Boomerang shaped object with bright white light emanating from the rear of the craft. A boomerang shaped craft flew silently threw the clouds in the night sky.  It was roughly the size of a C-130.  There was an extremely bright white light emanating from the rear of the craft, and the sky remained lit up as the craft continued.  After several minutes the light trail began to look phosphorescent.  The glow remained for almost 10 minutes and then vanished.  A civil aircraft flew overhead, and it was obviously very different.

Triangular color changing object in the east;2009-02-28 20:00:00;10 minutes;Triangular color changing object in the east We were outside for a walk in the neighborhood and we looked up to see 2 color changing figures in a shape of a triangle.  The objects were turning very slowly in one place.  They were changing various colors such as red, orange,yellow, white, and blue. One of the objects faded and disappeared in a blink of an eye.  The other object moved very fast to the west and headed toward us. As it past over it made no sound. Soon after we went inside we came back to find 3 other bright multicolored lights in about the same place as the others.   This time the objects turned the same colors but one stayed white.  They were in a triangular shape while flying and soon broke off quickly into different directions.  As they broke off one went to the side and stopped turning colors then vanished for 10 seconds and came back.  The next one went the opposite way that it started and stayed turning colors.  The one that stayed all white went to the south side for a couple minutes then started heading toward us again.  All of these made no noise and soon dimmed into the night.  After about 30 minutes we went back to look again and there was nothing.   It was all clear except one tiny little star.  If anyone saw a similar sighting at about the same time (which is 8:30 pm on February 28, 2009) please report the sighting.  Thank-You!  ((names deleted));33.893163095238;-117.748259920635
