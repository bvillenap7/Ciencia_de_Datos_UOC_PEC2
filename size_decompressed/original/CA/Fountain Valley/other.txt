We were;1977-10-01 19:00:00;6 minutes;My brother, his friend and I saw an orange pyramid-shaped object in the sky about 25 yards away from us and about 25 yards up.  We were kids at the time, but my recollections are for the most part vivid. 1st Object: Estimated height was about 7 feet at the apex.  The base was probably about 7x7 feet also.  The object appeared solid and metalic.  My younger brother and I insist the object was orange, but his friend believed it to be greenish. 2nd Object: Estimated diameter was about 1 foot.  The sphere was red and appeared luminiscent. The first object appeared above a neighbor's house while we were standing on the sidewalk.  It hovered above the house and some power lines.  The second object, a red sphere, came out of the object and descended about 10 feet below the first object.  After the descent of the sphere, the pyramid object began to rise and move slowly toward the south-east.  After traveling slowly for several hundred yards, it accelerated very quickly on its south-east path and disappeared.  I can't recall what happened to the red sphere. I was about 12, my brother 9 and his friend about 10.  My brother was rated gifted and talented, I was an above average student, and his friend had problems with school work and discipline and had been held back a grade.  We lived at ((address deleted)) Street, in Fountain Valley. Neither my brother nor I have had additional experiences of this nature.  We do not maintain contact with my brother's friend.  I tell people occassionally about the events, while my brother chooses not to bring it up.;33.707299009901;-117.950625742574
Silent, green object sits under color-changing friend;2012-09-28 20:30:00;45 minutes;Silent, green object sits under color-changing friend The event began with a silent, green object flying over my father-in laws house in a straight line.  It seemed to be made up of 10-11 smaller circular green lights, all of equal size and none blinking. This object flew at a consistent speed and was too bright to be at a high altitude but was too quiet (silent) to be at a low altitude.   This motivated me to follow the object across the sky, expecting it to turn toward one of the airports nearby.  It didn't and instead decreased in speed, finally stopping directly under a distant, yellow-white star.  At this point my father-in-law and wife started viewing the object, as I had been narrating the trajectory to them as kind of a satire on UFO's. Then, the &quotstar&quot above the object changed to red. Not light red but fully red. This was NOT a star at all.   Soon thereafter a third object, much smaller or farther away, moved directly over the two objects, then frooze.  Then it was gone.  We got out binoclulars and were able to clearly see the multiple green lights on the original object.  The second object also could be seen going from red to white aver minute or so. As these objects slowly dipped below the horizon another set of 3 bright objects came into view and formed a triangle, then remained motionless, until also slipping out of view. For all of us, it was our first UFO experience.;33.707299009901;-117.950625742574
