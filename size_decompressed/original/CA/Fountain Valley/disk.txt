DISK SHAPED CRAFT IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY;2006-02-20 21:00:00;2-3 mintues;DISK SHAPED CRAFT IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY I was driving in my car when I noticed a lit up Disk shaped craft w/ green on it. The craft was really low as it decended in mid air, it then shot up in the sky and hid behind some tall trees. I know it wasn't a plane or helicopter because it moved very agile. I also passed a street light that the craft was near, it suddenly turned on...wierd.. I tried to drive by it, but it must of took off.... I always thought ufo's were fake or B.S, but now I am beginning to wonder.;33.707299009901;-117.950625742574
