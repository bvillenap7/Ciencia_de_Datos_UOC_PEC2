I was looking up at the stars when I noticed a very dull appearing  star I thought it was strange  I had never seen a star look like that . My house is located between two airports, the Long Beach airport and John Wayne airport I am very used to planes flying over. There were three planes flying over the area at that time and the object which I still believed was a star did not move it was only after the sky cleared it began to move across the sky when again planes were coming into the area it stopped  and only after they passed did it continue to move. I called my daughter from the house and she came out I pointed out the object and she clearly saw it also we watched as it passed directly overhead of us . The object was extremely high in the sky way higher in altitude then any plane I have seen since living here. We continued to watch  as the object seemed to climb higher then disappear  in the night sky . The object appeared to be round yet there was bulk to it very hard to describe and it seemed to have a dull red glow about it but as it flew overhead it was dark and remained that way till it disappeared  it moved very slowly until the very end when it seemed to disappear quickly.;33.707299009901;-117.950625742574
