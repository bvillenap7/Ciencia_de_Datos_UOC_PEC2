UFO gives light show in urban amerca, party on! not.;2012-09-17 01:10:00;5 minutes;UFO gives light show in urban amerca, party on! not. Our back yard faces John Wayne Airport and it is quiet common to see planes fly over.  However this night it was over cast.  I was letting the dog out, and saw a round red light come from out of the marine layer.  I thought it was odd because it came downward and I wasn't hearing anything.  I looked up to my sons room and heard him talking to his friend online, I lit a cigarette, and turned back towards the craft. I noticed it was coming very fast towrds me which is odd, and theres no sound. As I took a puff off my smoke, the think flashed.   So out of curiosity I swung my cigarette back and forth and sure enough this craft flashed red and a dim white, then dropped like sparkler like sparks out of the bottom.  I called to my son and yelled for him to get his camera, but he didn't hear me. I have bad legs, so I hobbled into the house to get my phone because it has a camera on it and it was totally gone.  It looked like it was over the police station if I had to! judge its placement.  But sure did make me scared, and it takes alot to shake me up.;33.707299009901;-117.950625742574
Something that looked and sounded like it was exploding in the sky stopped exploding and flew away.;2017-02-22 21:00:00;3 minutes;Something that looked and sounded like it was exploding in the sky stopped exploding and flew away. I was walking my dog and heard what I thought were fireworks. I looked up to where the noise was coming from and saw something in the sky.  It looked and sounded like it was exploding.  Sort of like the crakeling sound fireworks make as well as flashes of white light.. I noticed another craft parallel to the first one.  It looked like it was waiting for it. The first one stopped exploding and I continued watching it, expecting it to fall from the sky, but it didn't. It, along with the other one, began moving east in the sky still parallel to one another.  The first ones lights  were much dimmer than the second one. The flew out of sight.
