Two objects at high altitude merge into one then disapear completely.;2012-02-05 10:40:00;5 seconds;Two objects at high altitude merge into one then disapear completely. Noticed two objects, high altitude, possibly over Mile Square Park, flying side by side, one lagging a bit.  Objects traveled NNE direction.  Then, the one lagging accelerated quickly into the other object at a higher speed, appearing to collide with the other object.  It seemed to merge into one object for three seconds, then all disapeared completely.  Approximate speed at that altitude: 200mph.   Sky was clear that morning.  Visability over 10 miles.  Possibly two fighter jets on patrol but there was no engine sound.  And the objects should have remained in view across the sky.  No cloud cover.  Two balloons?  Traveling too fast.  And both should have remained at a constant speed.  And the odds of two balloons popping at the same time becoming invisible are too great.  Unknown shape because of the altitude.  Contact me only if others saw the same object or unable to detect on radar tapes.;33.707299009901;-117.950625742574
