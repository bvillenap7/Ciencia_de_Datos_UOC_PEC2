unusual lights in the sky;2002-06-06 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;unusual lights in the sky My wife was outside with the next door neighbor when the lights caught her attention in the nortern sky. There were two lights that seemed to stay on the same place for almost five minutes,the one on top was brighter with an orange color to it and the bottom one was white.She said it was the intense brightness of the top light that made it strange.After what she thought was an eternity, the top bright orange light came together with the bottom light.At that moment my wife stopped looking to knock on the window and get my attention.The neighbor said something came out from the bottom of one of the lights.When I got outside the lights were in a horizontal position slowly moving west.A tree blocked my view after awhile so I ran to find a better view but the lights were gone.;32.8079;-115.3809
