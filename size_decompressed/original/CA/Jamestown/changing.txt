UFOs over my house nightly;2010-07-25 22:00:00;ongoing;UFOs over my house nightly These sightings have been ongoing since January 2009. They occur nightly without fail. All photo captures are from the front yard of my home. I have over 5000 still pics of these objects. I have compiles them into a few video compilations and I have posted them on you tube. I AM A 48 YEAR OLD MALE. I do not prank and I take what I am getting pictures of very seriously. My channel on you tube is called botifigus if you would rather not click on the links that i have provided. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIdHWdV3D2M  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUDIsVH2HJ4  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHzJKnNRkUo   there about 11 video compilations in all, these were all captured in the month of July, 2010. They were all captured at night. Upon hearing you on Coast to Coast last night.  it seems as though pranks are an issue and a pain in the neck for your organization. I would think that it would be. As you don't want to be pranked, I do not want my intellect insulted.  I filed a report with MUFON and must say I was embarrassed for that organization for its lack of integrity.  The investigator made contact with me via the phone having never even looked at the pictures that I submitted. If you initiate an investigation please at least view what I am offering before contacting me, or please do not contact me. I am also not inclined to listen to the satellite or other heavenly bodies meme.  Satellites and other heavenly bodies do not get within 2500 feet of one's home.  Lastly , if there is no interest in what I have photographed that is understandable.  Again there is much to more elaborate on these things and will should you be interested.;37.89;-120.4764
