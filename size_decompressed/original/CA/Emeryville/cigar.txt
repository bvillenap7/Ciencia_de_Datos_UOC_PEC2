Fast moving linear object with three lights in a night sky.;2009-06-15 22:00:00;3-4 seconds;Fast moving linear object with three lights in a night sky. The craft(s) moved in a straight line to the North in the night sky through light clouds. My viewing was limited, as I was looking straight up and could see it until a house blocked my view. I would say about 30 degrees out from my view straight up. The craft looked like three lights on  jumbo jets wing(which would only have one light). The formation was aligned at a slight angle and flew at a high rate of speed silently.;37.8369327868853;-122.277526229508
