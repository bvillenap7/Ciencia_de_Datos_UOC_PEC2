Very bright green flash of light over Emeryville, California.;2006-02-27 19:20:00;1 second;Very bright green flash of light over Emeryville, California. Not sure what (if anything) happened but I was driving westbound on Interstate 580 (just before the Oakland Bay Bridge) and an incredibly bright green flash lit up the entire sky.  I thought I was witnessing some type of explosion but there was no sound following the flash and no visual evidence presented itself.  Other drivers appeared to notice the flash as well, as the light-to-moderate traffic slowed immediately and noticeably after the flash.  I don't know if this qualifies as a UFO sighting but it did seem extremely strange at the time and I was curious if anybody else reported anything.;37.8369327868853;-122.277526229508
