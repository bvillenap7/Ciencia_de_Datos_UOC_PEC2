I saw something that I at first thought was a vapor trail from a plane but there was no plane in sight and it was moving fairly fast with no real wind at ground level. For a moment it appeared to change its form and then return to its chevron shape. Then I lost sight of it. It was headed toward Berkeley, California after passing over Emeryville.
