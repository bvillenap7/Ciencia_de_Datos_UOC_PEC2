I was standing in a maintenance yard using nvg goggles looking up to the sky noticed 8 objects overhead.  ((anonymous report));2016-09-26 05:20:00;~1 minute;I'm a security guard for a Country Club and I was standing in a maintenance yard using nvg goggles looking up to the sky noticed 8 objects flying over me.  The objects look as bright as a star.   I was trying to keep track on them with the nvg goggles heading  east to west  within one minute.  The flying objects were side-by-side to each other doing different types of formations.  At one point I noticed that the flying objects were in a square form shape and breaking up from each other and going back to each other very fast.   I tried to see them without the nvg goggles and I was unable to locate them with my eyes.   I use the nvg goggles again and saw them again disappear further and further away from me heading west.
