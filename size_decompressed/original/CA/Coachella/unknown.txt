((HOAX??))  black winged creature.;2017-09-18 17:54:00;2 days;September 16, early morning, 5 am or dusk hour, I woke up and went outside and saw a creature, bigger than any kind of bird I have ever seen- was all black with huge wing span I would guess 7-10 feet, maybe larger.  It was quite high in altitude, lower than an airplane, about a little higher than what helicopters fly at... It looked like a human, almost demonic creature--bony arms hanging down with claw like hands it was very silent but I felt like it knew of my looking at it and I was quite struck with fear, but awe as well.  I told my spouse and he said indifferently it must have been a fruit bat... I looked up fruit bat, flying fox fruit bat and the like, and this did not match the description.   Now just a few minutes ago my spouse and I saw a very strange (what he considers to be a drone)and huge black winged creature now this had to be more like 40+ feet wing span very thick wings, very thick body- but like an airplane body... this first creatur! e was thin, almost transparent and clearly had a human like body attached a head, legs, and arms with claw like hands like 3 fingers and a thumb... well this object we just saw was huge, flying south and veered off to the east. we grabbed the binoculars and followed it but lost sight of it.  The other creature was flying from the northwest to the southeast.;33.6742;-116.1735
