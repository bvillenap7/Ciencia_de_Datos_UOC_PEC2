Driving along the 680 freeway, northbound, I was scanning the skyline ahead of us. My buddy was driving on our way home from work and I, as I do every time on the road at night, was looking for strange craft.  Typically I see these triangles over my home in Tracy Ca as they are the ones flying the lowest, quietest, and slowest over the town, usually in groups of two to three, one after another, in the same path.  Friday nights view was the best I've ever had.  First I see up above, a standard plane, similar to a U2, with no lights on.  It had a red and green light, and no others.  About two minutes later, as I scan ahead of us, all of a sudden there it was.  It appeared out of no where. Nowhere was it in front of us until, I must have blinked, and there were two lights ahead and sllight right of us, about 1-2 miles from us.  Freeway is packed and as we pass to the left of the craft, it was no more than 500 yards to my right and 250 yards up.   I saw a perfect triangle with three big lights in each corner.  Center was a tiny light and between each big light and the center light was a medium light.  This was by far the best vision of this triangle I've ever seen.   I rolled down my window pointing and my buddy didnt get to see it all lit up, sort of hovering to the right like I did.  Traffic was heavy.  Often these planes come in and appear to land or hover about the Sunol grade area, just before the 84 exit.  This one either was invisible and came out at that moment, or perhaps he was moving at such a quick speed that when he stopped, I was able to view him.  Amazing!;37.6117;-121.9019
