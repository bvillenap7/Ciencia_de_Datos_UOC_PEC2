Star that stops, slows, stops,slows,then drops out of sight.;2010-10-13 20:30:00;12 seconds;Star that stops, slows, stops,slows, then drops out of sight. I was on a small country road and stopped to see the stars. I enjoy the fresh air and was observing the stars.  The night was clear.  A starlike star shape came out from like a ziplok bag, or from being tossed out! It seemed almost like a kid's toy as it was droppping like 1:15,3:15, 4:15, on a clock!  It seemed to have very unusual way of controling its movement and then soon after persihed behind the Vargas Hills. I have seen many stars over the years, yet none like this. It also had a very bright whitish firey tail that was very bright! What is more interesting, is it was 10x bigger than any falling star I have ever seen! I did not see a craft. I saw a star with a whitish firey tail.;37.6117;-121.9019
