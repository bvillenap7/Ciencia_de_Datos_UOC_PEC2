Huge Dark/Black rectangular object in the sky.;2008-02-23 13:30:00;5 minutes;Huge Dark/Black rectangular object in the sky. We were taking a walk when I looked up and saw a huge dark/black rectangular shaped object that seemed to be floating through the air. The object did not make any sound what so ever that I could tell. This thing was the biggest thing I have ever seen in the air, and it was probably several miles away. I noticed a small Cessna aircraft in the vicinity and the object dwarfed the aircraft. The Cessna aircraft look as big as a pinhead next to this object. The object then moved in a southerly direction and disappeared behind a building. I went around the building to maintain my view and the object seemed to have just disappeared. There were several other people out walking and saw this object as well.;33.93;-117.9477
