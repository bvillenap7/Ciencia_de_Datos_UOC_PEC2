I took one look and yelled its a UFO.I started running down my apartment on to the street towards the UFO.I stood below it, my son 5 years old and my brother in law also joined me.  We saw very clearly a flat disk base with sides just like a saucer. There were very bright independent rings of light around the UFO.  It was moving at a very slow pace, no noise just silent, it was not even spinning.  It almost slowed to a stop for a moment and then move away towards the hills and over them, disappearing out of sight.  There were also 2 alternating blinking lights near the base.  I tried to call 911 it was busy then I call 411 to get the non emergency telephone number for the police, it kept coming busy ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.93;-117.9477
