It looked too low to be a satellite.  I did mark a diamond shape, but it literally looks like the stars in the sky this isn't the first time I've witnessed UFOs over my city in La Habra California .   I was on the phone with one of my friends describing to her when I was seeing .  I hope I put the correct time it was about 8:50pm closer to 9 PM when I witness this.   I was wondering if anybody else witness what I saw last night July 22, 2017 ?;33.93;-117.9477
