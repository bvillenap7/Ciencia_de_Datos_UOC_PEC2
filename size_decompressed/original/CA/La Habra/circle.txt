Circled shape object vanishes near La Habra, CA.;2013-10-02 19:15:00;:10;Circled shape object vanishes near La Habra Ca I was looking at Mercury with the naked eye.  A couple of moments later I see what looked to be a white/silver circle shape object (similar to what a star looks like with the naked eyes) slowly moving across the sky at a very high altitude.   The white/silver circle then began to slowly dim away to the point where it just disappeared.   The circled object did not resemble a plane, it was simply a glowing circled shaped object that vanished slowly.;33.93;-117.9477

I saw 2 Green Orbs flying over La Habra California.;2014-10-23 23:30:00;5 minutes;I saw 2 Green Orbs flying over La Habra California Thursday 10-23-2014 Approximately 11:30pm. I had my sliding glass door open and I noticed 2 bright green orbs (circular balls) in the sky side by side. I would estimate that they were about 1 to 2 miles away from my house in La Habra when first saw them. I was looking in a south west direction at them. Within a few seconds they began to separate and go in different directions. One of them went in an easterly direction the other went north. There were no visible blinking lights on them. Just a green glowing ball of light. I walked out into my balcony and continued to watch them. They both seemed to be completely silent. The one going east was going over the hills along the south La Habra and Fullerton border. This orb was not high above the hills. Maybe it was only 200 to 300 feet above the hills. The other orb going north eventually went out of my sight range when it passed beyond the hill where I live. At this point I continued to watch the orb headed in an easterly direction over the hills along the La Habra and Fullerton border. I would estimate that it was traveling about 50 miles per hour I would guess. I noticed that this green orb then turned completed red for maybe 5 or 10 seconds and then back to green. After traveling about 1 to 2 miles it then came to a stop and just hovered for about 30 seconds to a minute. Then it began to descend straight down getting closer and closer to the ground. Where it was descending is about 1 to 1 ½ miles from my house. I expected that it would descend beyond the hill and out of sight but it turned out that it was on this side of the hill and I was able to continue to see it descend. During it’s descent I noticed that the other orb that had left my field of view reappeared from behind the hill and was moving directly toward the other. The orb that was descending then appeared as 3 lights. I saw a green light, a red light and a white light. The other orb as far as I could tell passed the one that was descending and seemed to go over the hill and out of sight. The orb that was descending eventually was obscured by trees across the street from me. I waited maybe 10 minutes to see if it would reappear but it did not. The next night I kept a watch out at the same time to see if they reappeared but I saw nothing.;33.93;-117.9477
