MY FAMILY WITNESSED HIGH FLYING OVAL LIGHTS, THAT APPEARED HIGHER THAN NORMAL AIRPLANE TRAFFIC.  THE PATTERNS WERE PARALLED. THE DIRECTION WAS NORTH AND SOUTH EAST & WEST, THE 4 BRIGHT LIGHTS WERE FAST AND THEN SLOWED DOWN.  THERE WAS NORMAL AIR TRAFFIC BELOW THESE LIGHTS. AT ONE POINT ONE OF THE LIGHTS ILLUMINATED A BRIGHT FLASH AS IT PASSED THE STARS ABOVE IT.  THE PATTERNS WERE STRAIGHT AND THE LIGHTS DID DISAPPEAR AS IF THEY WERE ASCENDING HIGHER. AT THE TIME NO CLOUDS WERE IN THE SKY.  THIS LASTED ABOUT 20 MINUTES.  LOCATION WAS IN LA HABRA, CA MORE TOWARD LA HABRA HEIGHTS. 33° 55' 54 N / 117° 56' 43 W;33.93;-117.9477
Reddish hyper-speed object.;2016-11-10 00:00:00;1 second;Reddish hyper-speed object. Faint reddish light crossed Orion's belt from first star on the left to the right at very high velocity, seemingly at least above the stratosphere.  No discernable shape, but rate of speed alone faster than any comet or asteroid.   Light faded out shortly before clearing the Orion constellation.  However, movement beyond the faint point was still visible for few more seconds.;33.93;-117.9477
