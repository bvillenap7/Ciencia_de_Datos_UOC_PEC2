SILENT ORANGE ORB OVER MY NEIGHBORS HOUSE IN 1970;1970-07-07 20:00:00;10-20 min;SILENT ORANGE ORB OVER MY NEIGHBORS HOUSE IN 1970 i just read a post here about a glowing orb seen on highway 18 near arrowhead ca. i saw a orange glowing orb in 1970. i was walking to the garage from the house around 8 pm and stopped halfway between the two buildings not because a saw anything but because i had a sudden horible and frightening feeling i was being watched. i looked to my right and first peered into the bushes thinking someone was there watching me.  just then i saw the huge orange glowing sphere just hovering silently over my neighbors house. at the moment i looked at it i felt as if i was still being watched and then a puff of steam came out of the craft and it began to ascend. i ran through my house yelling for my family to come outside and we went into the front yard and watched (along with several of our neighbors) the craft ascend and make fast lateral movements until we could no longer see it anymore even through a pair of binaculars.
