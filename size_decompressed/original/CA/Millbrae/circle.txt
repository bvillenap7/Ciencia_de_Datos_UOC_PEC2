It was also moving left to right which was causing it to reflect sun off of it. I almost thought it was some advertising mechanism for a car dealership but then I realized it was moving too consistenly and was too high up.. and it was next to the airport and I'm assuming there's no car dealerships there nor any clearance for objects like kites or promotional balloons to be allowed up there. I definitely saw this metallic donut object, but I'm not sure if it's part of the control tower or airport somehow .. it seems almost surreal.  I couldn't observe it too long as I was on the highway and I exited and tried to find it again to no avail.;37.6005;-122.3993
