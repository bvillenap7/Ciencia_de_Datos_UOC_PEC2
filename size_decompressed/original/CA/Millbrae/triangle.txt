Spotted UFO: lights in the form of a triangle ascending into the sky (Millbrae, CA);2008-03-02 19:35:00;30 seconds;Spotted UFO: lights in the form of a triangle ascending into the sky (Millbrae, CA) I spotted an unidentified flying object at around 7:35PM Pacific time today, March 2, 2008 in Millbrae, California (20 minutes South of San Francisco)!  I was finishing a smoke outside, looking at the Big Dipper, when I noticed a movement appear out of nowhere near the constellation.  I focussed on it and saw what looked like lights in the form of a triangle.  There were maybe 12-15 lights total.  They appeared to be a purer white color than the yellow hue of the stars.  They almost looked like a flock of birds flying in formation but steadily all together so I assumed that these lights came from one object.  If it were next to the full moon, it would be about 75% of its size.  The UFO flew for 30 seconds at about a 45-degree angle from my view before disappearing into the sky, traveling from South to North ascending at a very smooth and rapid speed without making a sound.  I live near the San Francisco International Airport and have seen numerous airplanes in various stages of flight and also during take-off and landing throughout the day and into the night.  Airplanes are loud, and have different colored lights.  What I saw tonight was nothing like the planes Iâ€™ve seen departing or arriving from SFO Airport.  It was faster and silent. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual, and we found him to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));37.6005;-122.3993
