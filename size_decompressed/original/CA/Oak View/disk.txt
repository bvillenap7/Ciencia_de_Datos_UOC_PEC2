At about 17:30 hours, my wife noticed light glinting off an object in the sky toward the north of Oak View, appearing above Nordhoff Peak.  She called it to my attention, and after a moment, I went inside to get a pair of binoculars.  Through the 7x50 glasses, the object was very clearly visible against the sky above the mountains above Ojai.  It was saucer shaped, convex on both sides, and had an aspect ratio of about 1:6.  I watched it for several seconds, during which it wobbled at a rate of one cycle per three seconds or so as it drifted toward the east.  I said that it was a flying saucer, and handed my wife the binoculars.  She watched it for several seconds, and handed the binoculars back to me as she ran to telephone a friend who could possibly corroborate our sighting.  The friend was unable to see the object from their point of view, however.  I continued to watch the object as it drifted down and toward the east.  As it dropped below the horizon, I could see that it was clearly on the near side of the mountain ridge.  Meanwhile, my wife had found a neighbor who, unfortunately, arrived too late to see the object before it drifted out of sight behind some nearby trees, still moving toward the east.  We never saw any unnatural light or sound come from the object.  It never exhibited any non-ballistic motion.  We called the police, hoping that someone else had seen and reported it, but with no luck.  The object did not reappear in the sky as we watched.;34.4046;-119.3007
