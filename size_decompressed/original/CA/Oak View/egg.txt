Egg-shaped rust-colored craft in Oak View, CA rapidly traveling north to south, on Sat., Oct. 6.;2007-10-06 13:00:00;30 seconds to a minute;Egg-shaped rust-colored craft in Oak View, CA rapidly traveling north to south, on Sat., Oct. 6. On Saturday, Oct. 6, 2007, at about 1 p.m., I left my home in Oak View, CA and drove up Burnham Road east toward Ojai. After just about a half mile, I looked up to see an egg-shaped rust-colored craft moving from the north. It was, I would guess, less than a thousand feet above me and moving to the south. I was near enough that I could see sun glint off its surface and thought it must be a plane of some sort. It didn't have wings, though (none that I could discern), and it made no sound. It was not like any craft I've seen before. I rounded a bend and lost it when oak trees obscured my view. Then, the line of sight opened up and I saw it move very rapidly south until it was out of the sight to the south. It seemed to remain at about the same elevation that I initially observed it as it moved south. I've never seen a craft move that rapidly--only 15 to 30 seconds and it was well past the Ojai Valley and on to ranges to the south. Again, I heard no sound from it.;34.4046;-119.3007
