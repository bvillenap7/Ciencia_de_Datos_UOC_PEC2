Unique ufo light never seen ?or heard of????!!!;2012-05-28 21:38:00;15m;unique ufo light never seen ?or heard of????!!!   I was in out to get a cigar when i lit the cigar looking the right side facing out to the street, at my right there it was a blue red and one blue light joined together and going down to earth pretty  fast so i though it was a fine fire work from far away going down, when all of the sudden the light starter hovering up close toads my house's  city area, the light was or seemed to big very so big enough to to be probably a modern  balloon like the ones at baseball etc., so i though  it was a lighted balloon cause of it been today (memorial day may 28 2012) and in memorial day planes representing memorial day flied around the city as they planes are relay pretty too they do it every year. The red and blue light turned green white red purple bluish reddish blue greenish orange and it was way impressible so i ignored it as i remember there is a park right there, a school park so i though to my self its a RCA electric hovering UFO like seen on TV or internet, well i started to notice it started to change color with more intensity and moving from one place to an other really fast, and at very long distances all to quick for it to bee a balloon or RCA (electric radio controlled UFO) i just freaked out and i didn't event bother waking  up my dad to ask for his video camera.  After freaking out i was just thinking about the colored high intense light winch had small and big sizes as it moved when hovering, thinking of that that light was relaxing, like fireworks but UFO sh.the object never really changed shape only when it started to move like i have never even seen on the internet.
