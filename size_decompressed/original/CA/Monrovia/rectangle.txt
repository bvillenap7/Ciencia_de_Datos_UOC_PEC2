3 shiny stationary metallic edged shapes in a row around 8pm.;2001-07-01 20:00:00;5minutes;3 shiny stationary metallic edged shapes in a row around 8pm. While outside watering, I heard a plane go overhead and looked up to see it.  I noticed something beyond the plane, and looked at it intently as it was not moving.  I saw there were three of these metallic edged figures.  There were in a row, and not moving.  I watched them for a while, and had to go inside for a moment.  When I went back outside to see them again, they were gone.  They looked to be very high up, yet they were very shiny in the evening sunset.  I thought they must be satellites as they were not moving as any craft would be doing.  To verify the satellite theory, I again went out at 8pm the next night, but they weren't there.  I can't seem to dismiss this as satellites.  And I can't stop thinking about it.;34.1483192660556;-118.001561467892
Two mysterious rectangle objects.;2006-01-03 16:15:00;4 minutes;Two mysterious rectangle objects. While I was watching an eagle/hawk flying (looking south).  I notice two rectangle objects flying way above the eagle/hawk.  I estimate the two to be about at least 6,000 feet in the air.  At first I thought it were a pair of turkey vultures that are found in the Monrovia area.  But the two objects were not flapping the wings.  The two objects would move closer to each and then move apart.  The two objects were high in the sky, yet it appears to be large.  I only notice the rectangle shape, there was not any thing protruding from the object at all.  The two objects were either black or dark gray in color.  They were flying from east to west.  The two objects left no trail of any kind, and I did not notice any sounds from the objects.  The two objects were about 70 to 80 degrees from horizon.  Below is the wind information I obtained from NOAA web site.  I was unable to obtain winds aloft information.
