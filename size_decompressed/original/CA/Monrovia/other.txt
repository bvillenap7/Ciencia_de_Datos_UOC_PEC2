Three lights in diagnol form flashing in sequence(one light at a time, but rapid). It was obviously one structure and too big to be a plane or aircraft. I observed this ufo for about five to ten minutes(the whole time I observed this, it was statioinary, not moving at all,but hovering). I also observed two helicopters and an aircraft flying in very close proximity to this ufo. I lost track (or the plane and helicopters turned off their lights)of the helicopter and airplane. As I was watching the Ufo, I turned for a moment only to look right back up at the ufo, and it was gone. Imediatly after I noticed the Ufo gone the helicopters and airplane were right back flying where the Ufo was. I thought I saw the UFO reappear, but followed it in my car only to see a clear sky. I drove around franticly, looking for the UFO, but it was nowhere in sight.;34.1483192660556;-118.001561467892
