Strange lights near monrovia;2012-09-12 21:00:00;1 minute;strange lights near monrovia This actually happened twice to me in the same location. (first story..3 about months before 9-12-12) 10:30pm.  i was driving east on the 210 freeway.  as i approached the exit of santa anita ave. (stuck in traffic, moving very slow) there is a freeway wall (north side) and above the wall was a oval/roundish light,  Blue in color.  i noticed it as i moved slowly in traffic. this thing danced up and down and was doing loops in the sky. at this point i realized it wasnt a helicopter or any other kind of conventional craft.  as the freeway wall lowered and i moved forawrd.  i could see it take off and travel quickly to specific locations, then zoom back. it did appeared to fly around randomly. it was a fast object.  no helicopter could make these turns.  i could not see it much longer than 1-2 mins. in both sightings there were no other parts of the craft visible such as a helicopter tail or wings or anything else thet would prove to be some other kind of conv! entional air craft. just a solid blue light. Forward to 9-12-12 9:30 pm. same location.. no traffic this time.  i nothiced a red light just abvove the wall. and it moved up and down, sorta bobbing. in both cases maybe 20-30 feet above the freeway wall. i saw it as red this time, then it would fade to white. then after 3-4 seconds fade back to red.  it did not blink. but a very smooth fade from color to color.  i came back later after about 30 mins and i saw nothing. i go by this location everyday/night and theres nothing in the area right off the freeway like tall buildings or a crane, or power lines that would give off a light source.;34.1483192660556;-118.001561467892
