Color changing light quickly bobbing vertically and hovering over Monrovia CA;2013-08-03 23:00:00;~3 minutes;Color changing light quickly bobbing vertically and hovering over Monrovia CA I feel that I have pretty good depth perception, even at night, so I would describe it as having been between 100-300ft off the ground over about Foothill and Myrtle and rising/falling arythmically at a rate of about 100-200fps (around 100mph across only a couple hundred feet before pausing and changing direction) and sometimes hovering absolutely motionless.  It was bright white while rising and bright blue while falling, alternating red&gtblue&gtwhite while hovering, and all color transitions were extremely smooth.  Since I was viewing it across an arc of about 120 degrees, I feel confident saying there was no looping involved (like a conventional aircraft) as through the entire 120 degrees it appeared to move absolutely vertically bobbing up and down only.  I didn't see any police helicopters or other aircraft heading to the area, so I'm guessing no one is treating it like a national emergency or anything, but I'd sure like to know if there is a mundane, man-made explanation for this...

Multiple lights in the sky.;2013-11-24 18:28:00;3 minutes;Multiple lights in the sky. Sunday November 24, 2013, 18:28 (6:28PM)   At 18:28, the witness walks outside into the parking lot of the witnesses work on a routine walk when the witness sees a bright bluish white light above the San Gabriel Mountains that draws the witness attention.  The light is brighter than the planet Venus at its brightest and bigger in diameter.   The light object begins to dim then three other lights to the left of it appeared.  They were small and dim.  A total of four lights all together.   From left to right the colors are a dim white, a dim red, a dim orange and a dim white(the brightest light) that.  A few seconds later the farthest light became bright again as before.   The other lights were not noticeable when the bright light would be at its brightest.  Then it would dim and then get bright again for about three more times.   Then at around 18:31 the far right brightest light dimmed down and was in sync with the other lights.  All the lights begun to flash two to three times then all lights went dark.  The witness waited five minutes and the lights did not reappear.  The witness goes back inside the witnesses work.  Five minutes later the witness goes outside again to check if the lights were anywhere but could not be seen. The city the where the witness viewed the light object from is Monrovia, CA.  The area where the Light Objects or Light Spheres was seen is in the San Gabriel Mountains in the area four to eight miles north of Azusa, CA.  The heading from Monrovia would be North-North East.   From the witness point of view, the object was well above the top of the mountains.  The time frame when the Light Objects seen is 18:28 to 18:31.  The Light Objects or Light Spheres were in a straight line from the left to the right (NNW to SSE) as seen from the witness point of view.  There were a total of four lights seen including the brightest light.   The Brightest light color was a bluish to white light in the color temperature of 5500 to 6500 Kelvin.  The diameter of the bright Light Object was about 40-50% bigger than the planet Venus on the same night seen from the ground to the sky.   The Light Objects or Light Spheres seem to have never moved from its position.  The witness stepped outside from the b! uilding the witness was in and the Light Objects or Light Spheres were already in position and did not seem to move only disappear after the event happened.  No noise was heard possibly due because of the distance from object and witness.   The witness was alone at the time of the event.  Pictures were taken but due to lighting conditions and the technology there are inconclusive.   Conclusion is that the Light Objects or Light Spheres are unidentified.  The lights seemed to be together as one craft but the lights could be separate from each other.  There could be a possibility that the Light Objects or Light Spheres could be a helicopter but the way it behaved brings a doubt.   Note the witness is very knowledgeable in commercial and military aircraft.;34.1483192660556;-118.001561467892
