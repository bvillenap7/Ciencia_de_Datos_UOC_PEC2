Elongated Triangle traveling at a high speed, Southbound over Riverbank CA.;2012-09-23 22:00:00;4 seconds;Elongated Triangle traveling at a high speed, Southbound over Riverbank, CA. At about 10pm Sept. 23, 2012, a large elongated triangle was seen silently traveling due South at a very high rate of speed.  Altitude had to have been between 1500 and 2000 feet with a speed in excess of Mach 1. Night sky was clear with a half-moon backlighting the craft. There looked to be no lights but at least two of the sides had three shiny patches along the leading edges. At the time of the sighting, I was watching an R/C glider equipped with LEDs flying to the South West of the Unknowns flight path.  I looked to view a satellite and this craft entered my view.  I tracked it for only 2 or 3 seconds and lost it as it flew behind trees.;37.7308;-120.9382

Sitting in spa the black of night, I first saw this toward the beginning of winter heading north.  I've never seen a triangle plane that blended in the night sky with no sound, or fly that fast in my life.   I saw it again this evening however it was flying south.   Once again it was fast, low and no sound.   I thought I was seeing things the first time it happened however I know now it's real.
