Bright white lights that travel very smoothly across the skies and disappear slowly.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites??  PD));2014-02-20 08:30:00;45 seconds;Bright white lights that travel very smoothly across the skies and disappear slowly This is not a joke or a hoax...at night time you will see average of several lights in the sky that do not move like planes… You will see satellites but these lights sometimes make sharp turns and slowly disappear… I saw 3 travelling together in a triangular formation and one at a time disappeared and several minutes later saw a forth one that was very bright and as it continued travelling across the sky it disappeared right above us... they travel very high but you can tell that they are not satellites....I have had many of our friends witnessed these things...Just come to My Location and you will see them...;37.7308;-120.9382
There was a blue light traveling low from the east and picked up altitude.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;10-15 minutes;Could not see a craft. But there was a blue light traveling low from the east and picked up altitude as it headed west. It left a cloud that illuminated blue. As it got farther away you could still see the streak of light it was giving off. At times it would get brighter before it completely disappeared in the distance.
