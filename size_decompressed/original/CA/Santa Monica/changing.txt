Bright light over the Santa Monica mountains with an electrical effect.;2007-03-08 23:00:00;about 1-2 minutes;Bright light over the santa monica mountains with an electrical effect. We were driving home at about 11pm March 8th on the pacific coast highway when a large bright light appeared over the santa monica mountains.  The air felt electric and when I reached for my cell phone it shocked me!  The object first appeared in a circular form and hovered for several moments. We pulled over to get a better view, but it left almost as if our headlights had startled it.  As the object left it appeared to change from a circular to a long comet-like form shooting up and away into the sky.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
A UFO flow over the Santa Monica, Ca area at about 10:38 or 10:39 PM. on a clear and windy night. It was not a plane.;2008-01-12 10:38:00;3 minutes;A UFO flow over the Santa Monica, Ca area at about 10:38 or 10:39 PM. on a clear and windy night. It was not a plane. I was standing outside smoking a cig. There are always planes in flying over and past, going towards the LAX airport. So I looked up just to look at the sky. The stars are out tonight, due to very little cloud cover. So it's very, very clear tonight. Anyway, I was looking, west towards the ocean at the sky. I saw two planes off in the distances. Then i moved my eye towards the east and then i stopped and notice a bight light, that seemed to shimmer, yet it had no blinking light, like a planes or small jet, nor was it a helicopter. As soon as i saw it, i knew it was different. I thought maybe it's a balloon, but this had light around it and seemed to coming from it. Yet it had no locked shape or form, sort of round but not. I cannot tell how high it was, but i know it was at least as high as the plane, but it seemed a little higher up. from what i can tell this was not a balloon, nor a plane. It made no sound, not contrail. It moved faster then any plane in the sky, and theyâ€™re where at least three planes moving in different directions. It moved much faster then any of them and was across the sky before they where the same distance. I don't know what else to say, other then it was no plane and i have not ever seen anything like this before. It traveled in a straight line or path and yet the wind is blowing pretty strong here, so i don't think it was anything like a balloon.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
We saw a first fireball that broke in 2 pieces and kept moving south while the second light started moving in spirals.;2017-12-22 17:45:00;5 minutes;We saw a first fireball that broke in 2 pieces and kept moving south while the second light started moving in spirals. We saw a pretty big fireball moving south emitting a large smoke trail, bigger than a smoke trail emitted by a F-16.  After a minute or so it released a second, smaller light/fireball, as it happens when a meteorite breaks in the stratosphere.  The weird thing from a meteorite is that the first light kept moving ahead emitting a trail very similar to that of a comet (triangular bright trail) and stopped emitting the original smoke trail, while the second smaller light started composing spiral movements while slowing proceeding south (much slower than the first fireball).  After a minute the second light vanished and the first, bigger fireball kept going south until it went out of our sight.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
