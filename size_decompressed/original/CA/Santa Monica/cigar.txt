Silver cigar-shaped UFO hangs over Santa Monica Beach;2003-04-10 18:00:00;15 minutes;Silver cigar-shaped UFO hangs over Santa Monica Beach I was driving home from work on the 10 freeway going west into Santa Monica and we had just changed over to Daylight Savings time.  It was approximately 6:15PM/PST and I was listening to news radio and happened to see a rather large silver, cigar-shaped UFO hanging a bit low in the sky ahead, probably over the Santa Monica beach shoreline.  I was not too far from my exit and this luminous object was so present and transfixing that I could hardly keep my eyes on the road.  It was VERY visible, just hanging in the sky and there was no cloud/fog cover. I am not in the habit of looking for UFO's on my drive home from a busy work day, so seeing this strange object was really a surprise (I found out later, after the sighting, that UFO's have been known to be cigar-shaped).  The object hung in the sky for about 10-15 minutes and then simply disappeared-out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
Tic-Tac Shaped matte object quickly moves across the sky headed towards ocean.;2020-08-15 20:15:00;5 seconds;Tic-Tac Shaped matte object quickly moves across the sky headed towards ocean. I was sitting on a Hotel Balcony just after sunset.  The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the ocean.  Noticed the object traveling very quickly from east to west. The few clouds in the sky were still slightly orange which is why I was able to see it.  The light slightly bends around the tic tac shaped object, like a diffused glow from the orange in the sky.  The object was moving faster than anything I have ever seen and was clearly tic-tac shaped.  I've never seen anything like it and was extremely skeptical prior to this experience.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
