Then all of the sudden it began to move at tremendous speeds. We were wondering what it was since it was circiling around and the three searchlight type lights turned off and colored lights began to circle around the craft. We were all looking at each other saying is that a ufo?. Then it went at a high speed into the clouds. We could no longer see it. Then all of the sudden it appeared in another part of the sky. By this time we were sure it was a ufo. Then it dissapeared and didnt come back.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
