Silent, oblong-shaped bioluminescent-colored glowing disc observed flying northwest toward Santa Monica Mountains at dawn.;2019-12-15 06:39:00;8 seconds;Silent, oblong-shaped bioluminescent-colored glowing disc observed flying northwest toward Santa Monica Mountains at dawn. At 6:39 a.m. on Sunday morning (Dec. 15th 2019), I was walking down the alley behind our apartment in mid-city Santa Monica, California to my car. The sun was not out yet, but it was already easy to see outside.  As I neared my vehicle, I observed a wingless, flying craft at an approximately 2000-foot (600m) altitude traveling in a northwest direction toward the Santa Monica mountain range.  The craft, had an an oblong disc shape, much like a horseshoe crab (without a tail). It was wingless, silent and traveling rapidly. It was glowing a bioluminescent-like blue-green color. The color definitely seemed to emote from within, not from exterior lights or a reflection. It was more reminiscent of a deep-sea creature than a flying vehicle.  As the sky was already a faint hue of blue, it was easy to see there were neither wings or propellers on the craft. There was a faint white shadow-trail following it, giving it more of a teardrop appearance than it actually had. This did not appear to be exhaust, but something more electrical or energy oriented.  My best estimate on craft size is 10-40 feet (4m-12m) in diameter flying at 1500-3000 feet (450m-900m ) at velocity of 400-600 (650km-960km) miles an hour.  I did not see windows, but there appeared to be four folds in the material of the crafts underbelly, appearing as barely visible lines going from front to back.  I looked online a few hours later and expected to see hundreds of eyewitness testimonies, but saw none. From earth or beyond, I would really like to know what this thing was.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
