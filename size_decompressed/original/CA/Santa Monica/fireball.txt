Glowing object in the sky, which sparked with sparks, that moved very unlike an airplane or helicopter.;2001-03-07 00:02:00;3-5minutes;Glowing object in the sky, which sparked with sparks, that moved very unlike an airplane or helicopter. I was walking my fiance to her car at around midnight on 3/7/01 when she pointed something in the sky and asked: what is that?  We were in Santa Monica, CA, aproximatelly 7 blocks from the beach and looked West and saw like a glow in the sky.  It was definitelly not an airplane as we know what airplane look like as we have the LAX and SM airports close to us.  As a matter of fact, we saw an airplane go by with it's blinking light clearly identifiable. Initially, this object moved back and forth (did not go in a straing line in one direction) for what seemed like a minute.  It did not look like a helicopter moving either.  All of a sudden it started moving north-west and it even created some sparks (the same as a broken mufler that's dragged on the pavement) and then it disappeard behind the homes in our view.  I have never seen anything like this before.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
Two fireballs seen south of Santa Monica.;2010-09-22 21:00:00;2 minutes;Two fireballs seen south of Santa Monica. My wife and I were outside looking at the harvest moon and Jupiter, a few minutes after 9pm on September 22, when two lights became visible to the south-east of us, in the direction of LAX.    At first I thought they were landing lights of jets coming towards us, but as we watched, they became bright orange and fiery, like the exhaust from a rocket launch.   The skies were absolutely clear, and the full moon was lighting up everything so we could see that there was no smoke or contrail coming from the objects.    We watched as the objects appeared to go straight up, then turn in different directions (toward the east and south), as they appeared to leave the atmosphere.    The objects were about the size of half the diameter of a penny at arms length and were about two pennies apart.  The observation lasted maybe two minutes.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
