Cluster over Santa Monica, CA.;2007-07-01 13:00:00;10 mins;Cluster over Santa Monica, CA. Today I was walking back from lunch with a friend when I saw a cluster of white or silver round objects behind a cloud. They were very far away. At first they were clustered up, then the formation moved out almost like duplicating the Big Dipper. They were moving away from the area and hard to see without sunglasses.   My friend, who is a skeptic, agreed she saw something out of the ordinary.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
Large UFO, comes from over the ocean and then to over the santa monica pier.;2010-09-24 21:30:00;10 minutes;Large UFO, comes from over the ocean and then to over the santa monica pier. I was leaving my job in malibu around 8:59 PM  I Was Driving on the PCH headed towards Santa Monica, and then to the 10 freeway. I noticed it was a full moon and something in the sky caught my attention.  There was an object in the sky very visible and noticeable. I began to slow my motorcycle down to get a better look at it.  The object was circular, with yellow/green lights rotaing in a pattern around it.  It appeared to have two separate halves, like a top and a bottom.  The object was moving a fair speed and and i began to accelerate on my motorcycle to stay with it.  It was a large object, and close to ground. It appeared to be moving and stopping irregular.  I came to a stop light at PCH and the Incline, and raised my visor on my helmet to get a better view.  The object was silent and the patterns of lights changed once again.  At this point the object was pretty much directly above the santa monica pier.  I passed through mcluren tunnel and did 80mph all the wa! y home.  This object was moving at least two times faster than I, as it moved deeper into mid La.  I stayed behind this object as long as i could before it got too far and my exit approached. This thing was moving too fast to be a blimp, it was too low and quiet to be plane or helicopter. IM not sure what it was but it gave me chill bumps every second it was in my sights. I called santa monica PD when i got home to see if they had any other reports. as  of 10 45 PM:  No one else reported. This object was too bold and noticeable for anyone not to have seen it.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815

Flying relatively fast but smoothly, too.  Flying towards the ocean.  After about 10 seconds, it simply vanished into thin air.  Just look up Red Orb on any images site, it looks just like many of those images taken.
