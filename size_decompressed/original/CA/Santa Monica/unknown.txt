Two UFO's sighted over Los Angeles and reported on ABC channel 7 news the nest day.;1976-07-15 03:00:00;30 to 60 seconds;Two UFO's sighted over Los Angeles and reported on ABC channel 7 news the nest day. While walking east up Colorado Blvd. between Lincoln Blvd. and 14th St. my brother and I observed to lights moving in a southerly direction. The lights were moving in a staggered motion across the L.A. basin area. Lincoln Blvd. is approximately 1 mile from the ocean and these lights must have been anywhere from 15 to 25 miles from our position over Los Angeles or beyond. When the lights had staggered around in the sky for about 15 to 20 seconds they suddenly shot up at a 1 o'clock angle out into space and out of view. The next day the ABC channel 7 regional weather man Dr. George Fishbeck announced that the Air Force tracked two UFO's from San Fancisco to Los Angeles then the UFOs just blasted out into space of the radar.
