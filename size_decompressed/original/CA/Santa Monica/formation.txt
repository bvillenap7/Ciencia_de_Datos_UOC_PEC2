A 'V' shaped formation of lights passed overhead with no sound at high speed.;1998-06-12 21:35:00;5-7 seconds;A 'V' shaped formation of lights passed overhead with no sound at high speed. My wife and I were in the hot tub at 9:30 pm.  I do a lot of strenuous exercise, so I use the spa practically every night.  We're usually reclining, looking for falling stars and sattelites and watching the planes come in.  We're surrounded by airports (LAX, Santa Monica, Van Nuys, Burbank -- etc).  So we're accustumed to seeing lights in the sky, but not like this.   My wife was the first to see them.  She said,What the $%^& is that?  I turned and looked up to see this formation of 5, white, lights.  Flying from West to East at a couple thousand feet.  At first glance I thought it was a bunch of ultralights flying in formation.  There are a bunch of pilots in Santa Monica that have these planes and they often fly them in formation, but I've never seen them fly at night.   But as they passed over I realized these weren't aircraft lights (not conventional aircraft at least).  The lights themselves were sort of diamond shaped and not real bright and one of them seemed to be jockeying for position in the rear.   As the passed overhead I realized they made no sound -- which was the eeriest part.  My neighborhood is quiet and my spa wasn't turned on.  I lost sight of them over Hollywood.   My wife said she saw the formation 'flip' as it reached the ocean and start heading back toward the East.  I didn't see it 'flip' but from the time she saw it to the time I lost sight of it towards Hollywood was only a matter of about 5 seconds.  It or they were moving very fast and appeared at one point to dip slightly and rise again in perfect unison.  It was like a giant kite with lights on the edges -- although I could never make out any shape and assumed at the time that the lights were independent elements.  I'm 34 and work in the entertainment industry as does my wife -- who was a little rattled by the whole thing.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815

Formation of lights that looked like a flock of birds flying in formation in the shape of a large bird or eagle;2001-05-03 20:30:00;one minute;Formation of lights that looked like a flock of birds flying in formation in the shape of a large bird or eagle I saw a bird like or flock formation flying in ahead of an approaching aircraft. Both the formation and the aircraft were coming in off the ocean from a northwestern direction.  The formation was comprised of independant lights fling in step with each other to form a shape that looked like a large bird.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
Extremely bright light formation and disc shape over Santa Monica mountains.;2004-05-12 00:00:00;Approx 20 mins;Extremely bright light formation and disc shape over Santa Monica mountains. I was standing on the santa monica college roof with a friend, talking and drinking coffee when suddenly i told him to look north over the Santa Monica mountains. We both observed extremely bright blue/white lights creating a formation a few times, then dissapearing, just to re-appear a minute or so later, moving slowly in different directions and at one time forming a horizontal disk looking object only shortly. These lights lasted for about 20 minutes or so. We kept looking in that direction and all over the sky but no longer saw anything after that span. It was very strange, and it couldn't have been anything on the mountain, it had to be hovering and couldn't have been a helicopter or plane due to the hovering and multiple extremely bright lights appearing and disapearing. Very strange and neither of us have ever seen anything like that before while standing on the smc roof parking structure.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815

Mulitple successive nighttime formations of round unlit objects in V formations at speed.;2011-05-02 21:30:00;40 minutes;Mulitple successive nighttime formations of round unlit objects in V formations at speed. Returning home at around 9:30 P.M., I unlocked the door to the open deck which leads to my (top) 2nd floor apartment.  The deck provides a generous view of the sky, and my gaze was momentarily drawn toward several aircraft transiting nearby.  As we are within 2 miles of the local airport, this is not an unusual occurrence.  What was unusual was then noticing what at first appeared to be a V formation (the point toward direction of travel) of balloons flying rapidly over my apartment and disappearing beyond the roof-line. These were round or oblong objects, silent, non-illuminated, but visible because their somewhat matte surfaces reflected ground light.  They appeared to be at an elevation of anywhere from 800 to 6000 feet - difficult to judge in the dark night sky, but even at the lower elevation extreme would have been traveling at a velocity considerably in excess of balloons, birds, or even private aircraft.  Of course as there were between 12-14 round, discreet objects in this formation, they were clearly not planes and obviously not birds.  Passing overhead, the formation was about the size of 4 fingers held at arms length, flying West to East (from the ocean to inland) and they were visible for about 8-10 seconds. When first spotted at about 60 degrees above the horizon, they appeared to be a rigid, single, solid object with dim evenly-spaced lights defining a 90 degree angle V, but as they came toward my location I realized they were individual objects, some of which suddenly seemed almost to cavort with one another while still maintaining a loose V formation, though at an overall constant velocity. I quickly moved to a more unobstructed area of my deck, and was rewarded several minutes later by another formation flying in the same West to East corridor over my home.  Several more minutes and a third formation.  There was no wind at ground level, so I thought if these are balloons then the jet stream must be mighty low.   By the fourth formation, each one of which varied in total size from approximately 9 to 15 objects, the flight path was no longer overhead and was now Northwest to Southeast.   Another 5-8 minutes, and a Southeast to Northwest formation.  I realized then that these could not be balloons as they were flying in opposite directions and at quite a good clip.  A sixth formation, now after 10 P.M., flew exactly South to North.  Some of these had maintained a fairly fixed, evenly spaced ninety degree formation, while others exhibited the peculiar pooling and scattering behavior as they transited in a looser formation. My conclusion: it was a busy night overhead.   What I saw eludes a conventional explanation i.e. birds, balloons, private or commercial aircraft, known military aircraft - hence this report.  I don't therefore assume these to be of extraterrestrial provenance, although that remains one possibility. Secret military aircraft?  Possible - but that would be a lot of secret aircraft to throw at one relatively small section of sky in such a short period of time over a densely populated area.  Not likely.  And not likely I'll ever find out.   Now I'm going to bed.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
A massive formation of bright ascending glittering silent lights over the ocean.;2013-07-20 22:15:00;10 minutes;A massive formation of bright ascending glittering silent lights over the ocean. From my top deck, I saw a phalanx of spectacular bright golden lights, sometimes as many as thirty, ascending slowly over the ocean.   They shot up silently, three or four at a time, in a wide formation and disappeared into the sky.   It was the most fantastic unbelievable thing I have ever seen in my life.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
Multi-colored flying objects that were not noisy.;2016-09-22 22:00:00;20 minutes;Multi-colored flying objects that were not noisy. Multi colored lights unlike a plane.  They were quiet and I could not tell the shape.  They all moved in the same direction one after another.  It seemed too short of a time between objects to be planes and they were not noisy.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
