A bright light traveling at Great Velocity from the south to the north over the ocean off the coast of Santa Monica Pier.;2000-06-10 23:00:00;15 seconds;A bright light traveling at Great Velocity from the south to the north over the ocean off the coast of Santa Monica Pier. I was at the end of Santa Monica Pier on vacation and I was looking out into the ocean, which at the time was VERY dark.  I was trying to see if I could pinpoint any ships on the horizon, this being my first trip to the pacific ocean.  I noticed a bright white light that seemed to float a little bit off the ocean almost to the horizon.  it became brighter then it moved like nothing I've seen before from the left to the right.  I was startled by the speed because I am familiar with hydroplanes from the seattle area and I've seen them race at close proxmity.  I could understand the speed I saw if it was right next to the pier, but this was almost completely to the horizon.  I yelled to my wife, I just saw a UFO i said.  then I pointed it out to her just before it went over the horizon, she saw it too.  I noticed it was pright enough to shimmer off the waves giving a better representation of its distance. Personally I am familiar with tracking objects at a distance, having made a hobby of watching planes as a child and my aformentioned Hydroplane race watching. Also I know the physical limits one can achieve on a sea craft due to informal training from my father, who was in the navy sub fleet. I am sorry for the delay in publising this, I have recently moved and it has been a while since I even thought of it.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
something with lights giving off sparks and then disappeared into the night;2001-10-26 20:45:00;30s to 1min.;something with lights giving off sparks and then disappeared into the night At 8:45 PM, while driving west on the 10 freeway, approching the Lincon exit in Santa Monica, I saw a trail of bright white sparks coming from something with 3 or four lights on it. It was moving across the freeway, moving north, at maybe 5 or 10 thousand feet. The was a passenger high jet above it. At first I thought it might be a meteorite until I saw the jet about it. It gave of sparks for maybe 20 sec. and then the lights in the front part, or the nose of the direction part, went out. The sparks where like the once from a fireworks rocket, but this had head lights. So it was not firewoks. It was dark so I could not see any detail of a craft. Just 3 lights and sparks trails. I was also driving 65mph, and watching the road and sky. Later I called the Santa Monica police and asked if a plane had crashed in the area. They said no. I tried to get the number to the Santa Monica Airport tower but could not. I don't have a clue what this was. Maybe it was just a plane on fire and it lost power and landed ok.

Slow-moving comet-like object;2003-12-02 17:30:00;30 seconds;Slow-moving comet-like object Single orange-colored light rose above buildings to the east, trailing what appeared to be sparks.  I initially assumed it was a firework, but to my amazement, it continued to rise and move westward, with a spark still falling from the object every second or so.  It traversed the entire sky in about 30 seconds and disappeared from view over the western horizon.  I'm an aeronautical engineer and have never seen anything like it. (NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness intended a date in the year 2003, and we have changed the date above accordingly.  We believe the error arises from a glitch in our Online Report Form.

Two white, pinpoint lights at approximately 20,000 feet for 15 minutes;2004-12-04 11:40:00;15 MINUTES;I observed two white, pinpoint lights at approximately 20,000 feet for 15 minutes.  The objects slowly drifted to the northwest, maintaining the same angle to eachother, disappeared and reappeared and then continued in the same direction until gone for good.  I've seen these objects many times in the past: on clear days, if you look deeply into the blue sky, you can see them, sometimes more than one, sometimes in a formation, always at the same altitude and slowly drifting around.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
