Approx. 5 min. later I saw one by itself flying in the same direction. 5-10 min. later still I saw another further north of the first 3. ALL were silent. The circular lights were much larger than those I can clearly see on commercial aircraft departing LAX. I was out for a smoke. Looking up towards the LITTLE dipper (I think) I noticed a commercial airline jet leaving LAX (as my job is under the departing flight path for those flights heading east). My location was approx. 3/4mi south of the 10 frwy & 1/10 mi. east of PCH. 5-10 sec. later I saw something I'd never seen before, like no other aircraft I'd known. The TWO aircraft I saw appeared to 'chase' the jet from LAX but appeared to be LOWER in altitude than the jet. Each of the two chase craft had 5 or 6 circular lights along each edge (not the rear) of the craft. I could'nt believe what I saw.  Convinced I'd seen something truly strange...I stayed outside to see what else I might see. 5 minutes or so went by & YES I saw another one! Flying in the same direction...this thing looked just like the first two I'd earlier seen. Thinking I might miss something I stayed outside for another 5-10 minutes. Then I saw a fourth, but this time something looked like it was chasing the 'spacecraft shape' I saw earlier and it was a pinhead in size compared in size to the larger craft. All of these craft I saw were the same size as the planes I see departing from LAX. I also live under the departing flight path of LAX as planes head east. I have seen A LOT of planes from LAX & this was like NOTHING I have ever seen before.  I also have lived in the San Fernando Valley & have seen Stealth fighters exit Van Nuys airport when they leave from the yearly airshow. I don't think these were Stealth. These craft were absoloutely silent, nothing no boom...nothing, yet I can hear just fine all of the jets and prop planes in the area. The circular lights did not blink but remained solid and were much larger than the lights I've seen on all the LAX jets...yet the craft was about the same size as an LAX jet. After I saw this FOURTH craft I alerted a coworker, shaken a bit. We watched for 5 min. or so, he went back to work, but I stayed & watched for an hour or so. I had seen all I was to see for the night.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815

daytime sighting over Santa Monica Mountains by  two 11 year olds at Summer Camp;2000-08-04 09:30:00;10 sec;daytime sighting over Santa Monica Mountains by  two 11 year olds at Summer Camp My son just told me of this, He was at camp for two weeks in Santa Monica and during the day of his last day he claims ( and I do belive him ) that he looked in the sky and saw a triangluar shape object with circles at each point going across the sky. I asked him how high did you think it was and he said about the height of normal helicopter. He said it made no sound at all, it was all silver/grayish. I then asked him if this object was on the ground how big do you think it would be and says as large as our mini-van. It had no lights. What a lucky kid!;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815

Dark grey triangular object cruising slowly north over Santa Monica making loud engine noise.  ((NUFORC Note:  B-2 bomber?  PD));2005-04-12 13:00:00;20 seconds;Dark grey triangular object cruising slowly north over Santa Monica making loud engine noise I was outside walking east on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica (near Los Angeles) and saw and heard a flat triangular object that was dark gray heading north.  It was making a loud engine noise.  It was not going very fast, kind of cruising.  I thought it looked strange, but not so strange that it was beyond human technology.  It was my impression that it was some sort of plane created by man.  Another person was walking toward me, and he had seen it too, and joked to me that it must have been a stealth plane.  If I held a baseball at arm's length, that is about the size of what I saw.  Even though I thought it was strange, I wouldn't assume it was a UFO.  But then I heard this object mentioned on the Jeff Rense show, and Peter Davenport and Jeff requested witnesses to describe it, so I have done so. ((COMMENT FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC SITE)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Thank you so very much for all that you do to help our global community.  I have been a regular to your site for some time now and this is my first time posting a report.  However,  what I saw and confirmed on April 12th, 2005 forced me to share this with the center in the hopes it will added to the database as a footnote.   Currently the database has 2 reports of a flying triangle over the Los Angeles and Santa Monica area on April 12th at approx. 13:00  (1 o'clock p.m.)  What our 2 witnesses were observing was the B-2 Stealth Bomber performing a low altitude fly-by of Dodger Stadium for the opening day ceremonies.  I observed the B-2 at approx. 13:07 from my backyard as it headed west towards Santa Monica at very low altitude approx. 700 to 900 ft. , roughly the same altitude as LAPD helicopters, and bank towards the north Santa Monica Mountains.  I tried to get a shot of this amazing airplane with my cell phone camera but I was too slow. What caught my attention was the engine noise.  Nothing like I've ever heard before.   My next door neighbor also witnessed the fly-by.  I live in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, roughly half way between the witness in downtown and the witness to my west  in Santa Monica.   Quote from the Los Angeles Times 4/13/05 The largest crowd ever at Dodger Stadium - 55,892 - barely had time to settle after watching the obligatory B-2 stealth bomber roar past when low-flying projectiles began doing damage. Starter Jeff Weaver gave up 11 hits and eight runs before being pulled after a Pedro Feliz homer. An airshow  message board also noted the B-2 fly-by for the Dodgers opener, and noted there will be another on Memorial Day May 30th, 2005.  Let's see how many reports come in that day. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END));34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
7-9 lights take a V Shape Formation as they glide in Total Silence - in Santa Monica;2008-04-22 22:00:00;1 minute;7-9 lights take a V Shape Formation as they glide in Total Silence - in Santa Monica We had 2 sightings about 5 minutes apart, the first was very strange, and the second one totally shocked us. I was with my friend and had a sudden impulse to go lay outside in the back yard with some binoculars to look at the stars. We took a blanket and were laying down for a few minutes when something at lightening speed zipped above us no more than 20 feet in a north to south direction. It seemed like a small object but it appeared and was gone within half a second, it almost seemed like a rocket. We were both saw and heard it and almost discounted it until we realized shared details of what we experienced. We heard a faint 'whizzing' sound as it zipped overhead.  The second experience was much more profound and happened a few minutes later. As we discussed the first incident, we noticed about 7-9 lights coming from the south towards the north. There were unlike any lights I have ever seen, they weren't bright, somewhat hazy. At first I thought it was a flock of birds but then I realized there was no flapping, and that I wouldn't see birds so clearly at this hour and at that altitude. Suddenly the lights took a V SHAPE formation as it passed above us in total silence. That was the most shocking part. It seemed like a giant triangle gliding silently at the edge of the clouds, it seemed quite large. I grabbed my binoculars and looked at it and saw that the lights had a strange geometric shape to them that were identical in each light. (I created an image file that I can email with this submission) I couldn't tell if it was one UFO with 9 lights or 9 lights in a V formation. All we could do was keep exclaiming 'oh my god what is that?' over and over as we watched it disppear on the north horizon. There was a lot of haziness in the light around it as if it was passing through the clouds, my mind literally short circuits when I try to think about it because it does not fit into the framework of anything I understand. Neither of us could get any sleep that night.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
V shaped formation with orange lights hovers over area and then seemingly vanishes;2009-10-31 21:30:00;5 minutes?;V shaped formation with orange lights hovers over area and then seemingly vanishes At some point between 9:30 and 10PM, the only known witness had taken a moment to go out back into the alley and light up a cigarette.  Not paying too much attention to what was going on, the witness suddenly realized a larger “V” shaped object in the sky to the immediate west.  The object was otherwise undefined except for the formation of orange lights that surrounded two sides of the object as if it were an illuminated flock of geese.  Besides being illuminated, this formation seemed to be hovering above and not in particular motion in the night sky (mostly clear skies at the time).  After watching the object for a few minutes, the witness ran to his front door and called for his wife to quickly come outside.  When the two returned to the area of visibility, the object was no longer visible.  A few planes entered the area shortly afterwards.  Given the perspective of these known aircraft, it appeared that the unknown object must have been considerably lar! ger and much higher in altitude than the ascending local air traffic.  With nothing more seemingly to see, the witness returned to his home.  The witness is just under 40 years old and would be considered a credible source.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
looked like stealth bomber;2011-05-02 21:00:00;1 fly over;looked like stealth bomber Night time looked to be the shape of a stealth bomber.  Had dim lights on underbelly outlining shape, approximately 10 to 12 very dim lights.  These where the only lights on vehicle.  Gliding in the night overhead with no sound whatsoever.  I have seen a lot of planes, my whole family has worked in the airline industry.  I have never seen anything like this.  There was an airliner in another part of the sky and the lights where very bright and blinking.  Weird;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
Triangle UFO over Santa Monica heading East.;2013-04-19 10:05:00;20 seconds;Triangle UFO over Santa Monica heading East I was in the vicinity of Idaho Avenue and 11th street and heard a large aircraft overhead...normally planes moving overhead to get into LAX landing pattern.  I looked up and saw a large plane.. possibly 747.   Nothing unusual.  But about 1 mile away from it, I saw what I first thought were 5 large birds flying in formation.  But then I got the feeling that there was something strange...the birds were a dim orange and flying a bit too tight the distance between them never changed. So I really focused on what I was seeing and noticed what seemed to be a triangular craft with 5 total lights (the birds) flying twice as fast (or maybe even more) than the airplane that first caught my attention.  From the moment I observed it (over the Ocean) until it disappeared (somewhere north of downtown LA), it only took about 20 seconds.  Meanwhile, the passenger plane was still very much visible and audible.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
