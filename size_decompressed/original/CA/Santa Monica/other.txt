Rapidly moving rings of light in the sky over Santa Monica, California on New Year's Eve.;2007-12-31 23:15:00;2 Minutes;Rapidly moving rings of light in the sky over Santa Monica, California on New Year's Eve. At roughly 11pm, while sitting outside, a small group of party-goers witnessed an oddly-shaped formation of lights almost directly overhead, moving east to west.  The object appeared to be two interconnected rings of lights on a single object spinning around a fixed center.  The pattern of lights was somewhat gyroscopic moving around an unidentifiable central shape.  The object moved rapidly across the sky.  Two people passed it off as airplane lights.  However, the rings were clearly moving around one central object and unlike anything I or the other guests have ever witnessed.  There was no trail of light or sound that accompanied the object.  The object also appeared to move faster than a typical plane, was very hight in the sky, and was not in a typical flight pattern for Los Angeles or Santa Monica Airports.  The height of the object made the rings difficult to make out.  However, on close study, there were two clearly defined rings of light moving about a central object.  The central object could not be seen clearly enough to describe it's shape.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
