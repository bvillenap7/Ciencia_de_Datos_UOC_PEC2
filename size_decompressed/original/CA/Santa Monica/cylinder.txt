Daytime UFO over Santa Monica Ca.;2002-03-18 16:22:00;6 min.;Daytime UFO over Santa Monica Ca. An associate of mine observed a cylinder shaped object hovering high in the clear blue skys over Santa Monica, Cal on the afternoon of March 18th 2002. I work near this associate and he's outside all day as parking cars. I mentioned that he should some day get a video camera because on clear days he may catch some ufos. And he did. He caught a cylinder shaped tube like object hight in the sky. The object made turns and emiied some kind of green energy or color on half of it. The object was completely white in color. I viewed the tape and made copies. The object had to be at least 2 - 3,000 ft. up. He also date and time stamped the video. I also have footage of daytime ufo orbs shot in Van Nuys, Cal on March 9th 2002. I will file the report.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
Clear day cylinder UFO caught on tape over Santa Monica , California.;2002-03-18 16:22:00;6 min.;Clear day cylinder UFO caught on tape over Santa Monica , California. An associate of mine observed a cylinder shaped object high in the clear blue sky on Monday the 18th of March 2002. I work near this valet associate. We speak every day as I make office transactions. I encouraged him to get a video camera because he's outside all day and would catch something on video in the clear daytime sky. Yes he got something on tape. I viewed it and made copies. He said that he was just looking around the blue sky and boom there was a giant cylinder tube like object. It appeared greenish, then completely white. He focused on the daytime moon and panned over to the object. He said the object was small and stretched out like a giant straw. The object moved slowly changing shape and position. It later faded. As he shot the footage, he date and time stamped it. I have copies.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815

Silver almost transparent looking objects over Santa Monica, CA 90401.;2013-11-09 09:45:00;30 seconds;Silver almost transparent looking objects over Santa Monica, CA 90401. Parked on Pacific Coast Highway 1 and Topanga Canyon Looking over Santa Monica CA Pier skyline. Just over the City moving towards the Santa Monica Pier 3 objects. All objects moved together but not just forward.  It seems they were in rotation. The sun was very bright but already high enough in the sky. The only reason I saw these silver almost transparent looking objects was due to the sun glasses and a dark tint over the top portion of my windshield.  Watching these for a little bit trying to understand what I am looking at. After I jumped out of my car with my iPhone to record.  Objects were gone.  Jumped back into my car and could not see them anymore.  No blinking lights.  Nothing.  Just transparent silvery looking objects. Could be weather balloons. However seems very large and self propelled.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
