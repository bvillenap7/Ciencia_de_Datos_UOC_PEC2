It was official looking nontheless. As mentioned above. I do remember that the morning which i saw this craft i had heard the news about the death of John Lennon. I was stunned after seeing this craft, so afterwards i really didn't think to much about Lennon. After watching the object for about ten minutes, which was hovering tha whole time, the thing took off quit fast. Not lightspeed, but faster than any aceeleration i had ever seen...to this day!;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
On May 7, 1997 I was looking north to the Santa Monica mountains and saw what I believed to be a helicopter shining its lights down on ;1997-05-07 01:00:00;2 minutes;Summary : On May 7, 1997 I was looking north to the Santa Monica mountains and saw what I believed to be a helicopter shining its lights down on the ocean or the mountains. I live in a penthouse where I have a wonderful view of the Santa Monica Mountains, the ocean and the city.  On a clear night, as this was, I can see very far.  I often sit out side to relax and look at my surroundings.  It is not uncommon to regularly see helicopters and planes from my view, especially with LAX so near.  This particular evening I saw what I thought to be a helicopter and it  really caught my attention.  I noticed that this helicopter was silent and usually they make quite a bit of noise.  I was looking at the object that I believed to be a helicopter and there was a direct light that it was shining  on the mountains, like a spotlight,  and moving low towards the ocean.  It was in a two to three mile distance of me, which is common for most of the helicopters in the area.  The light that I was watch!ing closely, without suspicion, disappeared, leaving puffs of smoke.  This was a trail of smoke that I had never seen a plane or a helicopter leave before.  The smoke was thick as if the object that it was coming from had been idled there for a long peroid of time and it had not been.  A few seconds later the object took off with enormous speed, heading north to the sky.  this is when I realized that the object could not be a helicopter at all.  Within seconds it was parked next to a star, very far away..  It probably reached its location next to the star in under five seconds. It was a clear path that it took and  it was as if it was trying to camaflauge itself  next to that star.  Then I saw a flashing red light that was actually  revolving.  From the distance where I was I could see the object and  I could tell that it was revolving with a red light..  A few seconds later it took off so fast that I could see it going north for about two seconds but it was going so fast th!at it just disappeared.  That is when I realized that I had seen a UFO.  I immediately called a friend and left a detailed message on her voice mail, as to not leave out any details and record it while it was fresh in my mind.  The next day I had to go out of town and did not know of your service until now.  I feel very relieved to have reported this and hope that someone may have seen something also.I have lived in California for a little over a year.  I moved to California from South Carolina for a job.  I am twenty four years old and am fairly concervative in my beliefs.  I was raised an Army Brat, therefore traveling is nothing new to me.   I run four miles every morning before work and consider myself to be very social.  I have never looked up the UFO website before. See above listed information.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
A disk-like object  viewed over Santa Monica, CA.;2004-05-23 13:30:00;1 minute;A disk-like object  viewed over Santa Monica, CA. I was driving east on Wilshire Blvd. Between 14th Street and 26th Street, at about 130PM. I noticed an object (maybe 2000 feet up, just below the cloud ceiling) that appeared to be over Westwood (about a mile to the east).  The object was clearly a disk. I cannot guess it's size. It was very shiny on one side (it seemed to be metallic). The other side seemed to be black and not reflecting any light. It was not stationary. Its movements were very erratic. Moving very short distances, in all directions. Going in and out of the clouds.  Flipping from side to side. Enabling me to see both sides of the disc. I was able to watch it (as I was driving) for about a minute, maybe two. By the time I arrived at my destination and parked, it was gone.;34.030354031065;-118.474957673815
