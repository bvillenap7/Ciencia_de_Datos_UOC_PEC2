Blue light moving erratically over South San Francisco;2011-01-16 23:00:00;15 min;Blue light moving erratically over South San Francisco I live in the Outer Richmond District in San Francisco (8 blocks from Ocean Beach) where I have a vantage point overlooking South San Francisco.  I was standing on my apartment building roof smoking at night when I spotted a bright blue light moving erratically in the sky above the South San Francisco area (I think).  It was hard to pinpoint its exact location as the fog was steadily increasing and gradually obstructing my view, but it was located not too far from the coast.  If I had to guess, I’d say it was flying/hovering about 200-400 feet from the ground.  Since it was hard to tell where the light/orb was coming from, it was hard to judge its speed as it moved from side to side and up and down in a somewhat erratic fashion.  It didn’t seem to be moving at a tremendous speed, but if it was indeed above South San Francisco, I’d guess it was moving at varied speeds, crossing a mile or two in about 5-10 seconds (again, very difficult to judge).   It would move one direction, slow down, and move the other direction in no apparent pattern, sometimes gaining some altitude, sometimes descending.  There was never a sudden jolt in speed.  There didn’t seem to be any other lights and I didn’t notice a spotlight coming from it.  I’m not aviation expert, but it didn’t seem to behave like a helicopter.  I watched it for about 5 minutes then it seemed to descend and disappear.  I went back inside and looked out my window with the same viewpoint and about 10 minutes later saw it emerge again.  I then went back out on my roof and watched it for another 5 minutes until the fog became heavy enough to completely block my view of it.  I don’t believe it was blinking, but its luminosity seemed to vary - but I attributed this to the fog.  Very weird.;37.6551064102564;-122.425653846154
A circular light in the sky moved horizontally then vanished;2012-01-01 15:00:00;less than 30 seconds;A circular light in the sky moved horizontally then vanished On January first, 2012, I was at a stoplight on El Camino and Arroyo in South San Francisco California around 3:30 p.m.  I looked in the sky and saw 2 lights perpendicular to each other that looked like commercial airplanes. I made a joke to my girlfriend that they were UFO's.  The aircraft seemed to be coming from the north and both were too high to land at the SFO airport.  The object on the left had a very steady flight path and ended up being a commercial passenger airplane.  The object on the right was had a flight pattern that that was very different. At a very high altitude the object on the right moved down towards the ground, then back up towards the sky and seemed to vanish into thin air.;37.6551064102564;-122.425653846154
A big bright white light streaks across the sky over US 101 for 2 seconds and disappears.;2012-05-04 23:28:00;2 seconds;A big bright white light streaks across the sky over US 101 for 2 seconds and disappears. Driving down US 101 going north, and just before I reach the Oyster Pt blvd exit I'm supposed to take, this big white light streaks across the sky just above us incredibly fast, in a northwards direction, and disappears. The light was bright white, and it seemed as if someone had a marker of bright white light and dragged it across the sky right in front of us.  It was too consistently bright, too low, and moving way too fast to be a plane, helicopter, or falling debris.  My friend in the passenger seat also saw it and we couldn't explain it, so the only explanation that made sense was a UFO.;37.6551064102564;-122.425653846154
