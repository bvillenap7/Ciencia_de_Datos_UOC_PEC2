Formation of lights over south san francisco and L.A;2009-07-09 22:00:00;5 min.;Formation of lights over south san francisco and L.A Thursday night driving back on the 280 south a little after 10 p.m. I noticed how large and low the moon was, and that there were two very bright lights underneath it.  I mentioned it to my passenger, and when he looked he said that it seemed they not moving.  Then the two lights separated into four separate lights..two and two..one over the other perfectly aligned.  Then they lined up horizontally right under the moon, and stayed there for most of our drive until the clouds rolled in…all lasted a good five minutes…it was awesome. Getting back to L.A. on Friday night about the same time, out of curiousity I went outside.  Closer to midnight it happened again!  So I will be outside again tonight with my camera!! The lights were a very bright clear white. I am a 55 year old , and my passenger is 21.  This was his first sighting, and my second, but this is my first formation.;37.6551064102564;-122.425653846154
