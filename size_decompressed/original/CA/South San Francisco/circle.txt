At first I thought it was an airplane as we live close to the airport.  This thing was flying toward me.  It was intriguing because I couldn’t see any wings of the “airplane”.   I called attention of my husband and it was also strange looking thing in the sky.  I brought the binoculars and saw a white bright ball in the sky going from south to north direction.  Then it changed its course to east.  It was jumping and mowing quite fast.  Then it was moving south and it disappeared in the distance.  I checked the sky for over the next hour looking for it.  I saw airplanes in the far distances and was able to see its wings so I’m sure it wasn’t airplane nor a bird.  My husband is very skeptical but today he was very sure he saw a moving ball in the sky that was jumping.  I need to add that it appeared that there was a gray small cloud around it, like a mist. We both saw the same thing.  I’m wondering if you have received similar sighting in my area;37.6551064102564;-122.425653846154
