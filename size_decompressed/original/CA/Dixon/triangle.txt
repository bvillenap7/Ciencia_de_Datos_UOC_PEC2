It moved over us like an airplane but the lights were flashing out of sequence compared the normal plane we see from Travis etc.  Very brite red and green flashes with intermittent spot  light flash pointed downward. It traveled off into the horizon much like the speed of a low aircraft ( no moise) for about 2 or 3 minutes then from quite  a distance it shot back to basicly rite over us in about 2 seconds warp speed it appeared.it turned brite red at hi speed.  This was real upclose and obvious.  All lights went out and I saw it was a grey triangle.  No doubt.;38.4374;-121.8122
