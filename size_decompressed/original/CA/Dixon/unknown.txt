Object entering atmosphere, moving lights.;2010-12-09 17:45:00;2-4 minutes;Object entering atmosphere, moving lights. I was looking out the commuter bus window (east bound) as it was approaching my exit. Traveling parallel to the bus on my left was what looked like a bright light with a tail, more like a comet. After a few seconds the objects tall start changing, getting shorter, like a rocket that is losing a stage. I thought maybe it was a meteor entering the atmosphere. The object now lost it's tail and now looked like a star, still traveling east at about the same speed. As the bus made it's exit off the freeway and veered right, I lost sight of it. The bus came to a stop sign, turned left toward town. I looked out the window and now saw a different object. In the same area in the sky but much closer was a oval group of lights on what must have been a flying object, moving to the left, then right, rather fast, then up and then back again. This didn't last long, the bus continued into town and turned toward my stop. The view was hidden now by buildings and trees. As I got off the bus, I looked for the object but it was gone. No one else seemed to notice anything but me. Sometimes I see lights or images in the bus window due to reflection but this was not the case. I'm not sure both objects were of the same source, but this happened within minutes of each other. Also, it was just about sunset and the sky was starting to get dark.;38.4374;-121.8122
