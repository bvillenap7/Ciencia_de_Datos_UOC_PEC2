10 balls of light descending at a 45 degree downward direction to the horizon line.  ((Starlink satellites??));2019-02-17 03:00:00;5 minutes;10 balls of light descending at a 45 degree downward direction to the horizon line Looking East/Southeast clearly seen from some distance away a line of 10 or so balls of light that descended at a 45 degree angle to the horizon line, each was equal distance from the other.  Almost like they were fired from a stationary object since they were perfectly aligned and did not vary in their trajectory downward.  Strangest thing I have ever seen.  From that distance and location, I am presuming they were tests from the China Lake Naval Weapons Testing area some 200 miles away from my location and located in the same direction, but that is only a hunch;38.4374;-121.8122
