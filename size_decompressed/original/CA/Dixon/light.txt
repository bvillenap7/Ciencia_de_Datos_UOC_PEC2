On occasion, they would turn orange or red.  We were riding on a motorcycle so I could not get a photo.   I kept watching as we approached them, looking for a tower of some sort that they would be attached to.  I assumed they were farming lights of some sort, but I kept my eyes on them for five minutes straight at one point.  As soon as we got close enough, almost right under them, and I realized they were not farm lights and that they were not attached to any type of tower..  They disappeared.;38.4374;-121.8122
