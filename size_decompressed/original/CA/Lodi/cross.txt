Low flyng glowing  goldish UFO;2010-07-22 13:00:00;30 sec;Low flyng glowing  goldish UFO since 6/21/10 every night at sun down you can see low flying  transparent objects and moving light in the sky. now we have planes flying around every night with flashing light on them. the planes move very fast with no sound.  7/22/10 we had 2 very loud /helicopters flying around all day. On 7/22/10 i was standing on my back patio and  i could see a lot of low flying and transparent objects  flying over my apartments almost like a see through shadow with no lights like they didnt want to be seen. I was getting ready to go in the house so i wasnt looking in the sky i looked to my left to turn around and g inside my house and i couldnt believe my eyes i saw a glowing gold metal it was so bright  object that looked like something  out of a scifi movie i still cant believe what i saw  i keep thinking what it could have been almost like i dont want to to be real. It wasnt very big about the size of a family S.U.V. it was thin in the middle and the shape was kinda! like a  upside down v and was going so fast and then just slowed for a second as it was almost like it was coming in for a landing about 100yds from me i will never forget what i seen i have been out every night for the last month looking in the sky hoping to see some kind of moving light changing colors in the sky i never thought i would see what there ship looks like up close i am 39yrs old with a wife  and 1yr old daughter i am was so scared for my family i cant even explain whats going through my mind i am not sure if i even want to tell anyone about about last night i am so worried and scared  on whats to come.  I am %100 sure there was at least #20 flying very low over my apartments last night going past one by one and there ships were transparent like a shadow that was see through its hard to explain its like they were hiding from the planes that were that flying around with very bright flashing like lights. I have lived here all my life i have never heard of any ki! nd of sightins hear ever... ((name deleted))   Lodi, Ca;38.1255407407408;-121.281775925926
