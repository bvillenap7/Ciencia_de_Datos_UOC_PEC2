We were travelling south on US 99. I was driving with my two sons and wife.  My 15 year old son told me there was something in the sky that looked strange to him.  I pulled to the side of the road.  I looked over and saw what appeared to be a huge blueish light about 30,000 feet above the ground hovering stationary.  What was more odd to me than the light was the fact that emanating from underneath the object was a beam of light that went all the way to the ground. I have spent time in airplane cockpits so I am sure I got the altitude pretty close.  Anyway, I know of no light posessed by Man that can travel such a distance without dissipating.   At this point, I told the kids--the other boy was twelve--to GET THE CAMERA.  During this time my wife was was just looking at it with a confused look with her mouth sort of agape.  We were all a little bit frightened.  We couldn't produce a camera in time unfortunately and after about 10 minutes the light or craft or whatever left the area at an impossible speed.  Just zippped away.  After it left there was a streak of blue in the sky where it had been.  My kids are are still amazed by it as am I.  My young son told a class of students about it and they all laughed at him.   My wife won't talk about it, probably since she has a very high-profile position in the defense industry.

Detected a moving circular light over a farm, next to the Interstate 5 freeway.

After 3-5 seconds, it shot straight up into the sky. As I was driving on the Interstate 5 freeway, northbound, I glanced to my left, especifically looking for a vehicle next to me, but I inadvertently saw a moving circular light hovering over a farm.   I immediately realized it was unusual, because the circular light was moving & hovering over the farm, while I did not see a possible natural source.   But after 3 to 5 seconds, the moving & hovering circular light shot up into the sky at about a 70 degree angle (90 degrees being perfectly straight up).  I almost felt like, whatever it was, detected I was watching and it immediately attempted to go away.   There did not seem to be anybody on the farm at the time, and everyone on the freeway were driving, and there most likely weren't anyone looking around, unless a vehicle had passengers looking around, so I may very well could have been the only one to see it.   During the time, there were no ready crops or anything visibly planted yet.  The farm ground was most green with trees on the far south end, and on the further west end, while the freeway was on the east end.   It was my first time witnessing such an event, and my general perspective of the event was like seeing something on TV in regards to UFOs.   The time was in the morning, around 8:30 am...   From my past, with people I've talked to, some have mentioned about strange lights on farms, but they typically ignored the situation.
