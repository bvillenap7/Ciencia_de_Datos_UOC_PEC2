Strange light over Lodi;2003-08-16 21:00:00;15-20 minutes;Strange light over Lodi Around 9:00p.m. I was sitting outside with some company. We were just hanging out enjoying the cool night. I walked out to the driveway and a light caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. I looked up (toward the East) and saw this very bright, deep, orange/red light flying very very fast through the sky. As it flew it zig zagged. I screamed for everyone to come look. For about 15-20 minutes we watched this light zig zag, go straight up at a high rate of speed, go straight down at a high rate of speed, go side to side, get real bright then very dim. I'm not good at guessing miles, but those with me guessed it was about 5 miles away. It was really amazing and we have no idea what it could have been.  It was sooo fast and moved incredibly.  All together there were six witnesses.;38.1255407407408;-121.281775925926
