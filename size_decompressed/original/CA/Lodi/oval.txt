There we;2012-03-28 18:25:00;?;As I was driving south bound on I5, in California, from Sacramento I was just driving 55mph on the slow lane to save on gas.  There were no vehicles around me, and the vehicle in front was far away, while I actually had a straight clear path.  So I glanced westward and noticed there was an oval like craft with unusual light sequences.  It did not look like a blimp, nor any other man made craft as it was just hovering at a distance in a stationary fashion.  I was unable to look for more than a few short seconds as I was driving, but the object was sure an unidentified flying object.  It would have been nice if someone else was driving, because it was a neat light show and I wanted to stare.  :) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.
