UFO (or something) seen in Lodi, CA (1996);1996-06-15 22:00:00;10 seconds;UFO (or something) seen in Lodi, CA (1996) In the summer of 1996 I was playing with a friend in their hottub, we were both about 12 years old. My sister was playing in the yard also, we were having a sleep over My friend and I looked up and there was a HUGE craft, it seemed to be close enough to almost touch! Probably about 100-200 feet up. It was about as big as a football field. It was a boomerang shape and there were two whit lights on each point, and a large red and white light in the center/front. The metal looked brownish, and you could see it all pieced together, like where it was welded together or something.There was NO sound at all. I looked over to my sister and screamed LOOK!!! and we all looked up and it was gone. My friend and I told her (my sister) about it, but the next monday in school I asked my friend and she said she didn't remember seeing anything. I don't know why she ever changed her mind. About 4 years later or so, not sure, I was taping the MTV music awards, don't ask why...anyways, I was flipping through on commericals and stopped on Unsolved Mysteries and what do you know! The EXACT thing that I had seen was on the TV about like 25 people who had seen it in like Tennesee or something. I hit record and got about a 1 second taping of the craft. Even though it was a re-creation it looked exactly the same. I don't know what ever happend to the tape. Oh well, just thought that I would share my story!! I looked up pictures on Google but couldn't find anything that matched. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));38.1255407407408;-121.281775925926
