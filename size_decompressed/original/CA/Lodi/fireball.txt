They hung around for about four hours, and military planes flew over. Around 7:30pm on Dec. 03, 1999, my cousin (who at the time was 10 years old) and I went outside to wait for Santa Claus to come by on his firetruck (a town Christmas tradition). I need to give you a quick description of where we live.  We live on the West side of Lodi, our house faced north but to the west of us across the street is nothing but fields going towards the delta.  The only houses around us are to the east and north.  As we were outside waiting I happened to turn to the west towards the field and noticed two large orange/red fireballs hanging over the field just a little above tree level.  I had my cousin go in the house and get three more of my relatives.  As we watched these lights they would appear and disappear as if throwing alight switch, and sometimes they would just get real dim then glow real brightly.  Around this time four more of my relatives were driving by so we flagged them down to watch.  There were other motorists on the road, and some looked like they were looking at the objects, but I'm not sure if any one else saw them.  Anyways, this whold thing lasted about four and a half hours of these huge fireballs appearing, disappearing, dimming, and darting back and forth. And the entire time aircraft was circling them, I mean lots and lots of airplanes.  AT one point a huge military plane flew right over our house and it was so low you could see the missles attached to it. One of the unknown craft went flying down the field, just barely over the grapevinyards, and it seemed to be spinning as it flew.  It had red and blue lights andit was so fast we couldn't even tell where it went.  So to make a long story short Lodi was full of strange lights that night and after that night we saw them around five or six more times.;38.1255407407408;-121.281775925926
My daughter and I in Lodi, California watched a Orange/yellow glowing object moving slowly over my house.;2005-11-06 21:53:00;1& 1/2 minutes;My daughter and I in Lodi, California watched a Orange/yellow glowing object moving slowly over my house. My daughter and I stepped out onto my patio last Sunday night and I immediately noticed an orange/yellow round shaped object in the sky it was heading from south to north over our house.  I could not tell how high it was, but it looked bigger overall than the usual air traffic that I would normally see in this area.  The first thing that I noticed about the object was that it had no navigation lights on it, instead the whole thing glowed brite orange/yellow.  It was moving much slower than an airplane and made absolutely no sound.  After about 20 seconds of watching this object it did something very weird, fire fell off of it.  It looked like some one poured a flaming liquid out of this object, at first the steam of fire coming out was brite yellow and then it changed to orange and then vanished.  If the object was say fifty feet in diameter then the steam of fire was 150 feet long.  As we watched, fire fell off three different times and then the whole object made a very sudden slow right turn and headed east, as it headed east the object began to turn a dull orange and then it vanished into the night sky.  I am 55 years old and my daughter is 26 and neither of us has ever seen anything like this in our lives. Thank you for your website!  ((name deleted));38.1255407407408;-121.281775925926
Fireball/orange like object spotted! Lodi, CA;2012-04-02 02:40:00;2-4 seconds;Fireball/orange like object spotted! Lodi,CA Southern Part of Lodi, CA, A fireball like object was seen by my brother and I.  From where we were the orange object seemed a distance away, maybe over the Northern Stockton or central Stockton area.  Was watching the night sky since it was very clear, then an orange fireball/light came from the lower horizon area and shot up into the sky.  Looked alot like a shooting star but orange and flew at a completely different direction than your usual shooting star.  The sighting did not last long, maybe 2-4 seconds or less.  Object had a weird orange hue and looked like a fireball sort of. Not much activity here in Lodi, CA so this definitely stood out to us.  My neck got sore from looking up so much.  Makes you hungry for more!!  Amazing!   :);38.1255407407408;-121.281775925926
