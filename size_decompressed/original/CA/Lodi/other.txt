Object was clearly seen but appeared and disappeared quickly. Traveling north on Highway 99 north of Lodi, CA and while traveling adjacent to the local airport which is alongside and perpendicular to the west side of the highway I briefly saw a rod shaped object. It hung directly over the freeway above the treeline. Although there was nothing in the sky to compare it to, my sense was that the object was about 30 feet long and about one quarter of a mile away at an altitude of maybe 100 to 150 feet. What first attracted my attention was a series of 4 to 6 sequentially flashing bright white lights, with possibly one or two smaller non-flashing lights inbetween the flashing lights. The object seemed to be in fairly sharp focus and I could see a thin gray or black rod that the lights seemed to be mounted to. The rod was at an angle of about 60 degrees, like a clock arm pointing at the number 11. It did not appear to be moving. My first thought was that it was a plane approaching the airport, although if it was approaching from the north it would be perpendicular to the runway. This was quickly followed by the thought that it might be a radio tower with flashers on it, although as I said, it hung directly over the freeway. Then it just simply disappeared as though someone threw a switch. I couldn't believe it and kept staring at the spot in the sky where I saw it. It made me wonder if any of the other motorists saw it. The whole sighting lasted about 2 seconds. The sighting occurred just as the sun was setting and the sky was still light colored. There were no clouds in the sky in the area. I have traveled this route weekly for the last eight years and am very familiar with objects along the highway.;38.1255407407408;-121.281775925926
3 distinct colored lights hovering over the city in the daytime;2006-10-22 12:00:00;2 minutes;3 distinct colored lights hovering over the city in the daytime I was driving and seen 3 distinct lights just hovering there in the middle of the sky up ahead. I stopped and took a few pictures of it, my friend was with me and took 2 of the pics. There was nothing around that could have reflected onto the sky and it wasnt during sunset when the sky can have many different colors. I looked at it a few min. later and it looked like it was starting to fade (I had to get back in and continue driving) and that was all I seen of it.

Not UFO, but lightning can appear identical to sightings and persist for unnaturally seeming long times.;2010-07-04 20:00:00;3 hrs;Not UFO, but lightning can appear identical to sightings and persist for unnaturally seeming long times. Have often observed UFO like orange to dark red flashes and glows as the warm summer ocean moisture ladened air stacks up to the north and east of us creating embedded glows.  The storms can be so intense they seem glow relentlessly.  Occasionally, patterns of glow would ignite and travel 15-30 degrees across ones field of vision well above the horizon appearing to be objects in motion and rapidly changing direction.   We were mystified until we learned the glows were cause by energetic lightening storms taking place approaching the Sierra Mountain Range.  The storms embed in clouds that can be invisible as they blend into the dust laden air.  The lightening create lights and shapes that move and persist for many seconds at a time ... and when you witness it, it seems like minutes.

Two small fast moving objects near clouds.;2019-03-20 18:00:00;5 seconds/5 seconds;Two small fast moving objects near clouds. On March 20 2019, about 6 pm, I was observing passing cumulus clouds when I saw an object. This object was rather small, moving at tremendous speed west to east.  The object appeared to be long and slender, about 5 times longer than it was thick.  It looked to be black in color, but that could not be verified.  It appeared to be pointed in front and tapered to the rear from it's thickest point.  Altitude is estimated to be about 6,000 feet, using the passing clouds as a reference.  I estimate the speed to be at least 500 mph.  It covered the visible arc from my viewing point in about 5 seconds.  This arc is about 45 degrees, give or take.  By the time I rounded the corner of my house for a better look, it was gone. About 3 minutes later, looking up to the West, I spotted an object that appeared to look like the first one.  This one was moving North to South at about half the speed as the first, but rapidly accelerated out of sight in an instant.;38.1255407407408;-121.281775925926

Suddenly I saw 3 lights, which I thought were stars, gliding across the sky.  One light was further ahead than the other two, they caught up to each other and then flew away.;38.1255407407408;-121.281775925926
