bright object eradically zig zaging in sky around airplanes, almost strobing light effect. above lodi,ca;2011-04-23 20:22:00;16 min;bright object eradically zig zaging in sky around airplanes, almost strobing light effect. above lodi,ca I was standing the front of my friends house and saw an object in the sky moving back and forth in every direction first it looked to be really high like a star but then noticed the clouds and a plane heading the direction of the object.  I then proceded to ask my friends if they saw the object to make sure that i wasn't just seeing things, they confirmed and then the plane disappeared in the clouds,  It looked like the object moving back and forth in front of the plane before the plane disappeared,  right before the plane passed it made an immediate dive down ward  and then back really far away,  then the object reurned and as another plane entered the air space of it again.    the object seemed to be flashing light but i couldnt really ditinguish any certain color, just like a star kind of twinkles, then every time it would make sudden movement, it would i guess kind of make this really bright light kind of undescribable too, just really bright kind of strobe li! ke not super fast but like two flashes a second.  I noticed the object at 8:22 pm and the object flew out of site at 8:38 pm.;38.1255407407408;-121.281775925926
