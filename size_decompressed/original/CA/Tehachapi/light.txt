I didn't pay much attention until I noticed several minutes later that the object had not moved. It was too high for a helicopter to hover and we live in a rural mountainous area with no reason for a helicopter to hover at night.  I got my binoculars to check it out and it seemed so strange I called my wife to come look. She also got binoculars and we watched it for several minutes.  She also said it looked very strange. Then we noticed another object much farther away and above the stationary object, that was travelling very fast and leaving a trail similar to a comets trail. It also was a white light but so far away that that was all we could see. The stationary object had a bright pulsating light that flashed about once a second. Between flashes you could see two red lights both on the right side of the white light. While we continued to watch it a plane came into view flying toward us and the lights on the object immediately went out.;35.1343999999999;-118.448
3 hovering flashing lites;2005-03-23 19:35:00;10 minutes;3 hovering flashing lites Three flashing red and green lites, at first glance I thought they were commercial aircraft which fly up here.  These lites were coming south west to North east, the commercial air traffic usually flys north west to south east of Tehachapi.  The lites I saw were about a thousand feet, I would estimate above the normal traffic, but I am not a expert so it is my estimate.  I came out twice that nite, and the lites were there both times, they at one point seemed to be standing still. Third time I came out there was no trace of the lites.;35.1343999999999;-118.448
Bright light over Tehachapi, Ca;2011-01-23 04:30:00;30 min;Bright light over Tehachapi, Ca   January 23, 2011:  My son was on his way to work about 4:10 am.  He spotted a very bright light at least 10 times larger than a star.   He called me and woke me up and said that he thinks he is seeing a UFO and said that I needed to get up and look.  I looked out my window and there was no doubt that something was hovering in the sky. I believe that this light could have been seen from Mojave, Edwards Air force base and surrounding areas.  My son lost visual of the light when he was driving in the mountains, but he had it in his sigh for about 30 minutes.  I looked at for about 5 minutes and decided to go back to bed. I donâ€™t own a camera so I did not take a picture.   One other thing my cell phone light was going quite bright then dim while I was talking to my son, it has never done that.  I have not seen the pictures my son took at this time.  I am wondering if anyone had seen this light.;35.1343999999999;-118.448
