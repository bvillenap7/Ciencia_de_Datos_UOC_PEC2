Tehachapi, CA.  9:29 pm.  6-7-2015  I received a phone call from my brother in-law he told me to go outside of my front door.  He told me he could see what looked like helicopters flying by.  My wife and I looked due north.  At about 30 degrees above the horizon what at first looked like orange balls in the sky.  After observing them and seeing one more come from the west, the other ones seemed to be flickering and fading out.  Iâ€™m pretty sure they were Chinese lanterns.   Whatever they were they were moving with the prevailing winds from the west heading due east.  Holding my hand out at arm's length I would say they were a little bigger than a bb. The next day, after talking to my sister and brother in-law, they said when they first spotted them, there were about 30 that passed by.;35.1343999999999;-118.448
