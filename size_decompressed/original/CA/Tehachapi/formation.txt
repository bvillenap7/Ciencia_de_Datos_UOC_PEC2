Sky was clear and stars where visible. I observed no other movement in the sky. The lights where bright and moving at the same time. The lights disappeared only to reappear as I got off the freeway and onto another side road. Same lights and same formation and going in the same direction.  I pulled over to get a better look and to take a picture but my stupid camera wouldn't focus. The lights once again disappeared as quickly as they appeared. There are many testing sites near tehachapi/mojave so I figured it might be helicopters in formation or something to that effect but as I rolled my window down I didn't hear anything. Other then freeway traffic it was for the most part quite. Never seen anything like that before. Well hopefully this information helps. Tried to get it to you while it was still fresh in my memory. Also I was bet! ween tucker road and tehachapi willow rd when I seen both sightings. Thank you and I hope the information I gave you helps.;35.1343999999999;-118.448
