It suddenly stopped the direction it was going in, then a moment later went in opposite direction, then stopped again, then went up a few degrees, then left, then right, then rather quickly went down some degrees before it went up again, then repeated this back and forth,up and down pattern.   At one point a small light broke off and descended straight down.  I don't know how long this object stayed in that area, as I went back to bed after watching for 45 minutes or more.;35.1343999999999;-118.448

Saw it in western sky about 35 degrees, thought it was a helium party balloon, but noticed it wasn't tumbling, but floating steadily eastward. It passed directly over my head and the building behind me cut off my field of vision as I turned around to watch it. It had no lights, but a whitish oval patch on the belly. There was no wind at ground level. As it passed overhead I was sure it could not be a balloon. It flew straight, silent and steady. It looked as though it was headed in a straight line directly over the town center. I'd be surprised if no one else saw it. Size: like a dime or nickel held at arm's length. Very clear and well defined.;35.1343999999999;-118.448
