I was laying in bed looking  north west out sliding glass door . I am at about 5,000 ft and look out over the valley floor.  I noticed a flashing light in sky, seemingly far away. it was tiny, but intensely bright. It grew larger as it came toward my location.  At first i thought perhaps something from Edwards AFB or a plane headed toward Bakersfield airport. it was difficult to judge speed as it was coming mostly diretly toward me.  not knowing its size i could not judge. it then move 90 degrees to the right and at that angle of view i could tell it was going fast . It then went up, down, right .left like no helicopter  or drone or aircraft could maneuver.  As it moved across my field of vision and came closer it could distinguish a white, red, green and blue light on the craft.  No craft I know of is that shape or displays lights in a triangle shape and those colors. the maneuvers were not curves, but abrupt 90 degree angles. it also rose and fell at an am! azing rate of speed.  I got out of bed, watched it from my deck from which i can see many miles. until it  was obscured by trees between me and the craft.;35.1343999999999;-118.448
