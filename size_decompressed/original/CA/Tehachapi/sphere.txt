Sphere with bright lights hovering and moving unlike anything I ever seen;2014-09-18 03:20:00;2 minutes;Sphere with bright lights hovering and moving unlike anything I ever seen My Uncle and I were on way home from Las Vegas stopped in Tehachapi, CA, around 3-3:20 am. We parked car with engine running while we ate.  And thats when we noticed bright lights hovering and moving oddly in the distance. We then wanted to record whatever it was, I placed my phone between windshield and dash and sphere shaped object began to come towards us at high rate and away.  We didnt realize the car has been pulled towards sphere about 30 degrees and my uncle leaned on horn with out notice and we both jumped out of fear.  The sound of the horn snapped us back into reality and we got out of there.;35.1343999999999;-118.448
