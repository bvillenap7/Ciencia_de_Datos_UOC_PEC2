Faster than a plane, but not as quick as a sho Witnessed two red steady silent lights moving west to east in a straight line across night sky. Faster than a plane, but not as quick as a shooting star.  Shortly after coyotes started to howl. I dont think it was a satellite.  The usual satellites I see are white and move pretty slow.

((HOAX??))  Long orange diagonal lights over Tehachapi Mountains.;2016-06-25 18:00:00;15-20 minutes;Long Orange diagonal lights over Tehachapi Mountains. Driving on Sierra highway towards Rosamond, I'm looking out the window and look towards the mountains that on the other side it's Bakersfield and at the top of the mountains about 50 to 100 feet above, I saw 1 bright reflective object, just staying still in the air, I thought it was a plane on coming, but as I stay looking for it for several minutes it starts to just look more silvery and metallic and about 8 minutes of it being still then after it starts to look like if it's disappearing and then as soon as I think it's gone from view, orange bright  slightly diagnal light starts to show from behind the mountain and slowly for the next 10 or so minutes the bright object shows how long it is I'd say about maybe 40 feet long and not only is it the object I saw but more on the right of it start to appear, the same orange bright diagnal shape light, my friend says look there is a dome on top of the light do u see it, I couldn't see it, but I saw about 4 or 5 of ! those light beams the exact same size appearing over the mountain, appearing as if they were always there, I record but none of it is clear on my video just the words and audio of what me and my friends are describing. I get to where I needed to go and after about 5 minutes I come back and look at the same spot and there is nothing, if it was chemtrails they sure would have been there still, but when I look I see nothing that I was looking at 5 minutes earlier, all I see is the plain blue sky.

Large Orange cluster of orbs;2021-05-19 00:23:00;1 minute;Large Orange cluster of orbs While watering the lawn facing north I observed  a long rectangular cluster of different sized orangish orb shapes above my neighbors house.the arrangement of the individual orbs had no real pattern or structure And the sizes were varied but all the same color. It moved together like one object but clearly was comprised of several distinctly seperate  orbs.i ran inside to get my phone to take a picture and one by one they disappeared. There are no clouds in the sky. I was a little scared so I called a friend, and while on the phone , in the same area of the sky I saw a line of about 6 small bluish lights following each other. I thought that the small ones could be starling as it looked similar but the website says that starlink is not visible in my location for the next 5 days.  When the orbs were disappearing it was as if they were passing behind a wall that wasn’t there, moving forward and just gone.. I don’t know how else to describe it.;34.8663999999999;-118.3409
