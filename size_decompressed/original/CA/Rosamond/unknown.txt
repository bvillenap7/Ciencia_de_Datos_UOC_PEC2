On a Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, I went to get water at an outdoor water vending machine.  As I was pulling up to it, I saw what I thought was the largest spotlight I have ever seen, shining its bright light down upon the fairly small town of Rosamond, which is approximately 80 miles north of Los Angeles.   I got out of my car, thinking at first that it was a helicopter.  I realized it was much too high in the sky for that.  I could not see what the object was because of the enormous light coming down from it, which lit up a large portion of the town.   Suddenly something liquid, visible in the light, began spraying down from the object.  The fluid descended quite rapidly, spreading as it fell down.   I quickly called my mom’s number so she might see the sight.  No answer. The huge light turned off and the object was gone, but I could still see the (glowing?) mist approaching in the dark.  Above, I could see a bluish/green glow left in the sky where the mist had fallen from.   I then called my sister who lived about 6 miles outside of town because I knew she and her husband sat outside each night.  She had also seen the bright light and remnants of the bluish/green glow…but had not seen the spray fall upon the town.  I learned the next day the armed forces said they had shot a missile which had flown over the L.A. area and near our town.  But if it was a missile, why did it stop over our town to spray us with something? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
