Oval orange colored object sighted in evening mojave desert sky traveling noiseless for 7 minutes and vanishes;2001-08-09 21:03:00;7min.;Oval orange colored object sighted in evening mojave desert sky traveling noiseless for 7 minutes and vanishes An orange (amber) soft glowing oval object was observed rising slowly from the eastern 20 degree horizon. Observed through 7X35 wide angle binoculars and was void of any sound whatsoever. No visible navigation or anti-collision lights. Estimated distance to be 3\4 miles from my point of view. Size difficult to determine but looked to be no larger than small commuter plane or F-16 fighter. Object accelerated upwards and advanced to a position in the southern (45 degrees) horizon in just two seconds covering an estimated distance of 8-9 miles. Object moved based on estimated size at about 30-40 MPH in a westerly direction across my line of vision. Movement or travel appeared to occilate up and down while maintaining the same distance between my observation point and said object. Observation continued west until it appeared to suddenly vanish from view. I have over 34 years of professional military aviation experience and for ten years (1988-1998) worked as a flight test engineer at Edwards Air Force Base California. I know that what I observed did not possess flight characteristics of any known commercial or military aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be extremely credible.  He has considerable experience in aviation, and he was convinced that what he had observed was not an aircraft.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of two seemingly quite credible reports from Rosamond, CA, submitted by this witness, submitted over the course of two years.  This witness seems to us to be exceptionally qualified as an observer.  PD));34.8663999999999;-118.3409
