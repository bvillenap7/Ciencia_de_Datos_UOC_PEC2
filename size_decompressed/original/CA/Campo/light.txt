object moved fast and in a straight line;2003-09-03 23:30:00;10 seconds;object moved fast and in a straight line we saw a light moving from north to south, moving real fast, the object did'nt show any other lights, for example : lights from the cabin, from the body or frame of an aircraft, there was no exhaust given like jet aircraft. Also the flight path was straight not curving like when meteors enter the atmosphere and start to fall. There were no sparks from friction. I estimate this object to be flying about 1500-3000 ft. We lost sight of it when some hills got between us.;32.6593;-116.4928
