Green point of light in the night sky expanded into a large triangle.;2000-08-01 23:00:00;at least 15 min;Green point of light in the night sky expanded into a large triangle. I was driving late at night alone Interstate 8 going Eastbound just East of Campo in late Summer of 2000.  To the North of the Interstate I saw a bright green point of light high in the sky, which then expanded into a bright green triangle (kind of like a fan or an umbrella opening).   The triangle continued to expand to fill a good amount of the sky, and since I was driving on the interstate I was not able to determine how long it remained in the sky nor how big it ended up expanding to.   I watched it for about 15 minutes until I could no longer see it anymore, not because of it disappearing but because I drove away from it.   I never observed whether there was an object emitting the light, or what the light source was. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));32.6593;-116.4928
