The object curled down in puff-like shapes of smoke(?) and then stopped, a round shaped appeared and glowed colors of blue and green then the glowing stopped and it seemed to disappear in a fast straight line away into the night. my reaction was simple, another UFO, oh, one of those...that's different from others that I've seen...esp. just right outside my window...I love it!;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Circular object with 8 white lights morphed then flew away.;2002-11-10 00:30:00;1 minute;Circular object with 8 white lights morphed then flew away. On Sunday morning at 12:30 am (Saturday night) I saw an circular object heading east over the Santa Monica mountains roughly around Sherman Oaks/ Studio City CA. The circular object had 4 pairs of lights positioned at 10:00 2:00 4:00 and 8:00 (if the object were a face of a clock). As I noticed the object and walked out onto my back lawn away from my back porch light the pairs of lights on the object went off and the object seemed to change shape. It sort of undulated as it morphed shape. As it morphed it  took shape of a boomerang for a second and them back to it undulating shape and then took a 45-degree right hand turn headed now south. There seemed to be a white light flashing in the middle of  the changing shape at this point it was moving away from me. The whole sitting lasted for probably 50 seconds ti 1 munute. Very bizarre!;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
3 Large disk shaped clouds over the Burbank CA Airport;2006-11-15 18:00:00;15-20 min;3 Large disk shaped clouds over the Burbank CA Airport Driving home from work I saw what appeared to be just 3 very large purple/grey oval shaped clouds of the side of the Burbank CA airport (where it's known that at one point they were hiding the stealth bomber). I live 2 blocks from the airport. As I got closer to home, the clouds caught my attention because they seemed to be shape-shifting without loosing mass or volume. At one point they almost looked like ancient asian symbols. The firt one I could not make out, the second one looked like a perfect mushroom, and the third one looked like a an ancient writing tablet. But what shocked me the most, was that the 3 clouds became oval shaped again! Getting more and more definition as I shorted the distance ariving at home. But what grabbed me the most, was that once all 3 had good oval definition, and a smaller (but still huge) oval cloud detached from underneath one of the biggest clouds in a perfect round/disk shape opening. It seemed to detach, and re-dock back with the other ship. The clouds disipated a few minutes. I could not believe my eyes. But I try to dismiss it myself as just the weirdest clouds I have ever seen in my life! And that's why I also thought that it will just get dismissed as clouds by anyone else, so I have never shown anyone.  And here is the kicker: I ran to my back yard, and I got to take some amazing pictures of most of the events!!  Please let me know if you are interested in seing them.  I do not want to send them to you just yet, until I talk to somebody (you contact me). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Numerous black parachute-like objects, very fast-moving, split off in different directions, then one triangular-shaped flat object.;2010-07-12 21:00:00;10 minutes;Nuerous black parachute-like objects, very fast-moving, split off in different directions, then one triangular-shaped flat object. We were driving home on the Interstate 5 southbound when we saw strange objects in the sky.  There were about three dark objects on the right and about 5-7 objects on the left of the freeway.  They did not have any lights.  The first 1 or 2 we saw we thought  were clouds, but then realized there were many more & they appeared to be descending and moving at the same time.   In looking closer they appeared to look like parachutes. Soon after that, however, we realized that assumption was impossible.  First of all, the objects were traveling at an impossibly fast speed.  Even though we were driving on the freeway, they continued to pull further and further away from us.   Another reason that these objects could not have been parachutes was because they never came close to the ground.  Eventually, it seemed that some split off the the right of the freeway towards our house, and some went to the left of the freeway toward the Van Nuys area.   After we got off the freeway, we started to go up the hill that we live on, and I continued to look for any sign of the objects.  That was when I saw an extremely large hovering, triangular shaped, flat craft above the mountain.  Again, it had no lights, but this time, it was motionless.   When I got home, I looked outside, but at that point, the object was either gone or out of sight.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
