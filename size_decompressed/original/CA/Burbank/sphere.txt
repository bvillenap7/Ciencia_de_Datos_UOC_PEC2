A bright gold sphere in Burbank, CA @ 8:30 pm seen in the southern sky;2003-11-17 20:30:00;10 munites;A bright gold sphere in Burbank, CA @ 8:30 pm seen in the southern sky At approx. 8:30 pm my daughter and I saw a gold sphere travelling slowly in the souhtern sky above Los Angeles/ Burnamk, CA.  My wife and I had seen this UFO before several months ago.  It traveled from the southern sky to the southwestern sky in a circular motion for about ten minutes.  I tried to get my telescope out and put the eyepieces together to see the object more closely.  At the same exact time I got the telescope ready to look at the bright gold object it disappeared! My 10 year old daughter was frightened and went inside just before it vanished.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244

Formation of 5 spheres above Burbank.;2008-02-11 15:05:00;4 Mins;Formation of 5 spheres above Burbank I first noticed them in my car when turning onto Olive Blvd from Barham, where you can see all the way down Olive to the mountain. They were clear as day, five SPHERES moving in formation, much too slowly to be planes. It almost seemed like they were moving too slow to even be able to fly. They were way too small to be blimps and shiny metallic. I would estimate they were about 2.5 miles away or less, and following the path of the 5 freeway. I also thought it was odd, because they appeared locked in formation with absolutely zero individual movement. I immediately went for my camera, because they just didn't seem to belong. As I was fumbling to grab my camera, I lost track of them once getting into the turning lane onto Hollywood Way, as they were blocked by the tall buildings. I was surprised to see them again when getting to Hollywood Way and Riverside Drive, where I finally got this picture. There are only four in this picture, because the 2nd from the right is blocked by the tree. I was getting honked at by people behind me and everyone walking on the street was looking to see what I was trying to get a picture of. I couldn't tell if they could see from their vantage points. I pulled over at the 76 Station at Hollywood Way and Alameda to get better pictures out of my car, but I could no longer locate them anywhere in the sky. It was very frustrating not being able to find them anywhere in the sky, especially after just getting a picture of them less than a minute before.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244

Large bright orange sphere, rapidly descending from NE to W.;2016-01-21 23:30:00;1-2 minutes;Large bright orange sphere, rapidly descending from NE to W. My sister and I were raised as military kids.  Father was an Air Force pilot.  I was a Flight Attendant for many years.  I am retired and my sister is approaching retirement in the next few years. On night of 01/21/16, between 23:15 and 23:40, we were outside on west side of house.  I was facing NW talking to my sister when coming from the NE traveling WNW I saw a very bright orange ball of light rapidly descending.   It made no noise and left no trail.  I pointed it out to my sister and we watched it for a few seconds then I turned to my left to observe the full moon to try to get a size comparison.  It was slightly larger than the full moon and very bright.  The closest color comparison would be terracotta with a little more yellow added. We watched it continue to descend for several more seconds then I went into the house to get my cell phone to try to get a video.  My sister continued to watch.  She went from the backyard, to front yard, to street to watch its descent.  By the time I got back it was gone.   She said it went out of sight.  Our street runs N to W and she said she lost sight of it right over the street facing west.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244

It did appear to look shiny, but it was in a hazy sky. No sound or lights of any kind. It was moving at a constant height and speed . Hard to tell exactly, It appeared to be maybe 10-20 in size and roughly 2-300 feet above me.  It flew directly over me going approx. 30 mph at a NW angle. I watched it as it went completely out of sight in the distance in a straight line.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
