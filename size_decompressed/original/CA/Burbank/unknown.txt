Aprox. 3000 - 8000 ft.alt., aprox 1 mile seperation. Two very distinct light sources holding a stationary position aprox 5mi e. of Burbank Airport. Aprox. 3000 - 8000 ft.alt., aprox 1 mile seperation object to south was closer (or brighter/larger), light sources were above and below with specific strobe periods objects would flash patterns between each other every 5 or 10 minutes.  Observed CHP launch chopper in direction of southern object at very low altitude, then return to airport.  Contacted local KNBC, no other reports at time of inquiry.  At aprox 05:35 a single light source, much lower in luminance, was seen moving slowly to the north away from the southern object for 2 - 3 seconds, then make very sharp turn of 160 deg. and move away at high rate of speed.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
1/17/03 6:12 am unknow craft moving from west to east shooting from anterior side followed by explosions;2003-01-17 06:12:00;5 minutes;1/17/03 6:12 am unknow craft moving from west to east shooting from anterior side followed by explosions I was warming up my motorhome to move it across the street for street cleaning day. I was casually glancing up at the Western sky when an object caught my eye as it was moving Eastward.  I thought it was an airplane at first.  It didn't make any erratic turns, however it's movements began to indicate to me that this wasn't a plane (eg. it made a leisurely circle would stop for a few moments and then resume moving again).  At this point I got out of the motohome to view more clearly. I then notice that the craft seemed to shoot something out of the anterior (west) side. A second later an impact seemed to have occurred causing what I would call an explosion. The craft moved forward a little and I ran in the house to wake up my wife and son.  When all three of us were on our front porch, I pointed to the craft which they easily found.  A few moments later the craft sent another emanation from the anterion causing the same effect (the explosion) as I had seen a few moments before.  The craft remained stationery for a few more moments then then began winking in and out.  I noticed that it seemed to be shuddering - then it was gone.

Strange orange glow like flame of hot air balloon - but without the balloon - over the evening sky in Burbank, CA.;2003-07-26 21:00:00;10 Minutes;Strange orange glow like flame of hot air balloon - but without the balloon - over the evening sky in Burbank, CA. We were outside on Saturday evening in Burbank, CA when during a family reunion gathering, someone said, What's that? and we all looked up and saw what looked like the flame from a hot air balloon - except without the balloon.  At first I thought it was a hot air balloon that was just dark in color and we couldn't see the balloon because of the night sky.  But the flame didn't flicker like a flame at all, and was a bright brilliant gold color.  Further diminishing the hot air balloon theory ... the object went from moving rather slowly, it started to seemingly gather a lot of speed and altitude.  Not fast, slower than say a jet aircraft -- but certainly what seemed too fast for any type of ballon depending on wind. And the altitude was certainly way too high for a balloon.  Eventually it continued on it is up-and-out pattern and eventually became too small to see.  This event was witnessed by probably 12 people-- all of which were at a loss to explain what it was.  By the time someone got binoculars it was too high and/or far to make out any detail.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
I saw a bright object with a short tail that appeared to be falling from the sky on a trajectory toward the earth in Burbank, CA;2003-08-26 21:10:00;5 sec;I saw a bright object with a short tail that appeared to be falling from the sky on a trajectory toward the earth in Burbank, CA.  I was driving on the I5 through Burbank, then exited at Buena Vista St. at approx. 9:10pm on Tues. 8/26/03 when I observed  this object which resembled a falling star but appeared to be much much closer.  As I was still traveling about 10 mph at that time, the object was no longer visible once it was low enough on the horizon.  The really strange thing was that after a few minutes I overheard Mr. KABC start talking about objects he had been seeing every day on his way to work in the past several days.  Was this a coincidence or what?!? ((NUFORC Note:  Please see a second report of apparently the same event, as seen from Poway, CA.  Possible meteor, we believe.  PD));34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Ghostly enormous lights of soft color with a foggy auora fly across Burbank, CA;2004-03-30 00:32:00;3 seconds;Ghostly enormous lights of soft color with a foggy auora fly across Burbank, CA On my way home from work. And walking up the steps to my apartment that has an open courtyard. When I got about half way up I looked up through the courtyard and saw something so colorful and bright. It moved towards the north. It had no shape it looked almost natural. Huge. I ran to the back of the apartments to see where it went, but it was gone. I waited and stared at the night sky hoping to see something. I must say that when I saw it, I kept waiting to hear a big boom. I got this overwhelming feeling that the ghostly sight with rainbow colored, soft, round orbs with in it, was some sort of attack. My friend who had picked me up from work, caught something she describes as angelic. She froze. I ran. We compared what it was we experienced by not explaining it to one another, but, by writting it down and letting each other read it. So as if not to allow our emotions to find a bond. The only thing about this that made me decide to share it, is that it flew to the north across us. Towards Burbank Airport. Which does not allow flights over the area after 10:00 p.m. And also that while I looked up to the sky hoping for more I noticed that about 1 minute after we saw it, something flew out of Burbank Airport quietly and headed west.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
daylight obstruction / eclipse before area wide power outtage in Los Angeles.;2005-09-12 12:15:00;15 seconds;daylight obstruction / eclipse before area wide power outtage in Los Angeles. I was in my bathroom on the backside of my house which is located in Burbank, CA it was approx. 12:15 in the afternoon. I didn't have any interior lights on in the bathroom as it was in the middle of the day and very sunny. The weather conditions were extremely clear with little to no cloud cover. Momentarily I noticed that the sky darkened considerably for approx. 5-9 seconds. I was confused as to what was causing it. Looking out my window I expected to see a truck park in the back driveway behind the house but there was nothing. Before I could get outside the sky had already illuminated itself once again. I saw no obstructions behind my house and nothing to explain it. Seconds later the power went out for the whole Southern California region. I was a little struck and thought that it was a coincidence or something else. I detected no craft but cannot explain the strange darkness in the sky before the power outtage. This report is being submitted for the sole fact that it occurred in broad daylight and possibly was noticed by others.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244

The second sighting about a quarter mile behind except at altitude of about 100 ft.  The lights were attached to something not distinguisable as it was dark.  I got out of my vehicle to look and could not hear anything.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
3 incredibly bright amber lights seen over Burbank,CA on Christmas night 2007.;2007-12-25 23:15:00;3 minutes;3 incredibly bright amber lights seen over Burbank,CA on Christmas night 2007. On returning home from a family Christmas dinner, my wife and I parked in front of the house at approximately 11:15pm. Passenger side of the car was facing our house and drivers side facing across the street toward the neighbors. I exited the car on the driver’s side and something caught my eye at almost star level, very high in the sky. I saw three extrememly bright amber lights,first in a straight line formation, stacked on top of each other. The objects hovered around each other, moving as I describe in “slow motion”. They 3 lights floated out of the stacked line formation and made a circle type formation, then back into a slightly curved line. There was no noise coming from the objects at all. This was nothing like I had ever seen before. The objects or object didn’t move like any airplanes or helicopter that I have seen. The silence and “slow motion” movement  looked extremely fluid and bizarre. The objects were completely stationary in between these intervals of formation for seconds at a time. The objects did not move across the sky, but stayed in the same area for the entire duration of our sighting. My wife,nervous from my silence standing outside the car, remained inside the car, asking what I was seeing. I urged her to come out and take a look. She instantly was taken aback by the strange lights and told me to run in inside and grab the video camera. The objects were seen by us for about a minute or two before I got the camera and returned. There is where the video begins. The lights were stationary ,extremely bright and slowly went back into a straight line or up and down formation. When switching the camera to “night mode” and looking back up into the sky, we noticed the lights now formed a triangle. This triangle began to move slowly just slightly to the left. All of a sudden one of the lights faded out completely, then the second, then the third.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Lights seen above burbank area 5 am from 134/2 freeways 5/21/12;2012-05-21 05:00:00;2 min;lights seen above burbank area 5 am from 134/2 freeways 5/21/12 I was driving to work approx. 5 am, I was on the 134 merging onto the 2, I saw what lights that were perfectly in line with two red lights on top, it looked almost like one floor of a skyscraper had its lights on, but it was way too high to be a building, plus I know where I saw it there are no building right there. The lights were way too wide to be an airplane or helicopter, too many lights as well. Also there was no movement to these lights they were perfectly still.  I noticed this right before getting to the 2 freeway, after debating in my head “what could this be?”  I decided I was going to pull over when I could find a safe spot (the 2 is super dark at this time) and try to take a picture, as soon as I was thinking that, the lights flickered and then they were gone. I think people who talk about this stuff and would even take the time to report it are crazy, but I feel whatever I saw was definitely unique and based on my knowledge of what’s out there a! s far as any type of aircraft goes the lights I saw don’t fit any description of any kind of plane, helicopter, blimp, and so on…..;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
