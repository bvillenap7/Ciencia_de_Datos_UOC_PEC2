Fireball over San Fernando Valley, CA;2001-10-26 20:45:00;5 seconds;Fireball over San Fernando Valley, CA I was looking westward at 8:45 pm I saw a bolide(?) coming in from the ocean shooting sparks out in a tail, about 5 seconds in duration, quite bright.   It was on the left of the Hercules constellation, but because of the offshore cloud bank behind it, I could tell it would have come low in over the west San Fernando Valley.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Boomerang UFO in Burbank, 11/13/13 at 10:30pm.;2013-11-13 22:30:00;5 minutes;Boomerang UFO in Burbank, 11/13/13 at 10:30pm I was looking out my window into the backyard and saw a boomerang shape of green lights.  If I held my hand out at arm's length, the space between my thumb and finger would measure between 4.5 to 5 inches wide (it was HUGE!).  The green lights shimmered/glowed and seemed to have a random pattern of brightness, almost like a morse code. Dogs in the neighborhood starting barking loudly. The lights slowly went over my home.  I ran through the house to the front yard, but due to the number of large trees lining my street, I was unable to see it clearly, other than some glowing light between the high branches.  By the time I got to a clearer area, the craft was gone. I didn't report it right away, but was looking online hoping for confirmation.  I do hope if someone reads this and saw something that night, they will confirm my sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Large White Aircraft Seeing Over Burbank;2021-07-04 04:30:00;3 minutes;Large White Aircraft Seeing Over Burbank At approximately 4:30 in the morning on July 4 and I walked out onto my second-story balcony that faces east to smoke a cigarette. I heard a humming noise coming from above so I looked up into the sky and saw an extremely large white craft flying west directly over my building. It had a flat bottom, slightly rounded sides, and white/blue/red lights on the craft. I immediately thought UFO mothership.  I’ve never seen anything this large flying this low, and ran back inside to grab my phone. I was able to snap two photos and wanted to grab a video, but the craft flew over my building and out of sight before obtaining. It has bothered me ever since, not knowing whether there was some type of blimp (closest object I can relate the craft to) or truly some type of unknown aircraft flying over the city during those hours. I just can’t shake the image of this craft out of my mind since July 4. Even though it has been some time since my sighting I felt it was applica! ble to report.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
