I don't know what it was.  I was driving north on Hollywood Way toward the Hollywood/Burbank airport.  I noticed a jet that had just taken off going southwest and was watching it climb (and I criticize cell phone users).  Right behind it and moving toward the northwest I noticed a white cylindrical object.  I thought it may have been a private aircraft but private aircraft aren't permitted to be that close to the airport.  It wasn't directly behind it but probably a few hundred feet behind it.  The object was kind of floating as it was moving.  I continued watching it as I was driving until the car next to me (I was in the inside lane) slowed down and began moving toward the lane I was in.   I took my eyes off of the object for less than 10 seconds.  When I looked back, the object was gone.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
