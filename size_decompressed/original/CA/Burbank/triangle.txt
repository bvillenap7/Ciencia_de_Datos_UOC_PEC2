6 orangish bright lights flew above us, then disappeared. . .;2003-01-01 00:05:00;3-5 Minutes;6 orangish bright lights flew above us, then disappeared. . . 6 orangish objects flew above west of Burbank towards the ocean.  We watched them fly at high speeds.  Periodically they would slow down almost to a stop, then resume flying very fast again.  All of a sudden they all stopped, and slowly their bright light (resembling stars almost) faded out.  This was all in a matter of 3 to 5 minuts that we all observed this. We have watched the news since witnessing this and there has been no word on anything.  In speaking with other friends (that were not with us that evening), they had also witnessed the sighting.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Gold light with red lights emitting sparks and sound above Burbank, CA;2003-12-24 01:00:00;5 minutes;Gold light with red lights emitting sparks and sound above Burbank, CA At 1:00 AM myself and 4 friends saw in the night sky a gold light moving in and out of the clouds emitting a red light with sparks and sound (a crackling noise)for a period of 5 minutes.  This is at least the third time we have seen this.  I tried to set up my telescope to see it better and by the time I got it my my viewfinder it disappeared.  But, I did see what I thought was a triangle shape in my viewfinder of the telescope.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
V-shaped craft with 4-bright lights on it's front tow sides, traveled over the 101 Freeway in Los Angeles, CA.;2004-02-05 19:30:00;10 minutes;V-shaped craft with 4-bright lights on it's front tow sides, traveled over the 101 Freeway in Los Angeles, CA. Entering the 134 Freeway heading west, I noticed a large dark craft with four bright lights (two lights on each side) moving at a slow speed above the freeway in the distance (1/2 of a mile) away. The 134 Freeway then turns into the 101 Freeway going north.  Once I was on the 101, I noticed the the craft was traveling at a very low speed (traffic below was moving at least 65mph) while the craft slowly moved east.  The four lights were very bright and the craft itself was black with no reflection to the solid (metal?) frame. As I came up to the side of the craft (my driver side), I noticed that the craft was in a trianular shape with a smaller triagular shape tail at it's end (like a whales fin - flat).  Once I passed the craft, from the back, you could barley see the it.  The lights that were bright from the front, where not visible from behind. Some how, the crafts metal frame was absorbing the light that it was giving off (four front lights were bright, but gave no reflection to the craft, unlike the lights on a car, once you get close enough, you can see the detail of the grill).  Last night a good friend of mine told me that he saw the same craft on Sunday, Feb. 8th at 8:00pm over the 90 Freeway (Marina Del Rey Freeway).  He gave me the same discript of craft and it's movement.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Two silently floating cloth-like triangular shaped objects shooting gold sparks near Bob Hope Airport;2005-07-15 02:24:00;10 minutes;Two silently floating cloth-like triangular shaped objects shooting gold sparks near Bob Hope Airport I am a backyard astronomer and on late Thursday evening early Friday morning, 2:24 am to be exact I saw two silent objects in my telescope following each other in a triangle/bell shape with gold retro rockets emitting gold colored sparks.  The objects looked like they were made of a cloth-like material. Each object had two firing retro rockets that were gold and each had a rectangular shaped L.E.D. screen in it near the same area.  The led's seemed to be displaying something. They looked like they were approaching Bob Hope Airport (formally Burbank Airport) The objects moved slowly and seemed to float as the sparks were emitted.  This sighting lasted ten minutes and only ended when the objects burned up in the west southwest sky.  It was a very clear evening.  I have been witness to at least two other sightings in the same area.  The last one was a rectangle shape that changed it's shape into a triangle. That time there were 4 witnesses with me. ((NUFORC Note:  We have sent an e-mail to the witness, requesting clarification on a few of the points he cites above.  PD));34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244

It had a triangular shape with white lights at each corner, and a big red blinking light in the middle.  It was floating around.  I decided to follow it, but it js zoomed off.  I came home and did some research to find that what I had seen others had seen as well.   So, therefore I am convinced that I saw a UFO.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
UFO over Burbank Studio and 134.;2015-08-07 15:30:00;4 minutes;UFO over Burbank Studio and 134 I saw a UFO over Burbank Studios.  I was walking outside a studio building and saw a daytime star overhead, but I think it was a triangle shape, or maybe rectangular slightly.  It had real bright lights making it look like a star at first glance.   It was really far up, I think.  It was just hovering above not moving much.   Earlier that day there was someone sky writing in the sky the word Compton.  Lots of people saw that!  Weird cause this is Burbank.
