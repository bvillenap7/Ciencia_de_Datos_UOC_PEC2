In formation/Abrupt formation change/Smaller objects shooting from larger ones/Up and out of sight.;2003-01-01 00:05:00;4-5 min;In formation/Abrupt formation change/Smaller objects shooting from larger ones/Up and out of sight. My wife and I are musicians we were returing home and were unloading our equipment. I had asked my son (age 15) and his friend to help me unload the truck.  I casually glanced to look for Orion which I tend to do.  I immediately noticed 6 stars that I didn't recognize. They were orangish yellow in color and they were moving.  I also observed that they were in a pattern of a very thin #4.  I called to my son and his friend and told them to look. I then called my wife who was 2 doors down wishing a neighbor Happy New year.  The cratf appeared to be traveling in a NW direction from the SW.  They were very high(could've been 100-200 miles).  We all noticed that they began to turn to the SW.  The turn was abrupt and they fomed another pattern similar to the Big Dipper.  They continued to extend  starting to form a single line and then one by one seemed to shoot straight up out of sight.  I did also notice that one or two seemed to have smaller lights shooting out from them and then disappearing.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Police spot 6 objects over the Burbank Airport on the evening 2/15/03.;2003-02-16 20:00:00;15mins;Police spot 6 objects over the Burbank Airport on the evening 2/15/03. I did not see the objects. I monitored the radio transmissions of two or more Burbank Airport police units talking to each other on their radio's about the 6 UFO'S over the Burbank Airport. The police also contacted the tower. The tower contacted the burbank police helicopter that begain searching for the objects. I'm sure all of this radio traffic was recorded by the city of burbank 911 center. Also the tower transmissions would be recorded by the FAA. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from southern California for similar events.  PD));34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
2 glowing objects that manuvered closely to each other then left in opposite diections rapidily;2006-12-16 15:30:00;less then 3 mins;2 glowing objects that manuvered closely to each other then left in opposite diections rapidily Pair of glowing objects that looked like a large orangish yellow orb attached to two smaller orbs (oOo). Manuevered in fast tight curves very close to each other. Very low to the ground (100ft?). Had appearance of landing lights when you are facing a conventional aircraft and intially I convinced myself that's what they were, I watched for running lights blinking and didn't see any that's when I became more suspicious. They moved so fast and close to each other that I could no longer believe that they were  conventional aircraft of any form. Near the end the two objects stopped swooping around and stopped in the same location one above the other by maybe 50ft. for maybe a second then they both curved away from each other in oppsosite directions. One heading North the other south. I watch the one heading north for about 10 seconds until I lost  tracks behind trees.  We were just south of Burbank airport and I was able to compare them to conventional aircraft including a helicopter that flew into the area.  I was able to see the running lights of these aircraft and none of the them were running landing lights. It was the comparison to these vehicles that led me to believe after careful thought and analysis that these objects needed to be reported. I know what aircraft can do and these were NOT conventional aircraft and moved consistent with an object that was not subject to gravity or inertia ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Invisible/cloaked craft with three (3) blinking amber lights travels over Burbank, CA.;2008-01-29 20:40:00;3 minutes;Invisible/cloaked craft with three (3) blinking amber lights travels over Burbank, CA. While out side, I notice three (3) blinking amber lights travel across the city of Burbank, CA.  The lights seem to be attached to an invisible/cloaked craft that was at least three hundred feet long.  After watching the lights for 3 minutes, a helicopter came into the area to investigate.  The lights seemed to fade away at this time. The helicopter then left the area. Further note: In the last 12 months, there has been an increase in helicopter activity over the city of Burbank.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
