Sudden appearance of a circling group of 7 or 8 red-orange orbs;2002-10-21 02:30:00;20 minutes;Sudden appearance of a circling group of 7 or 8 red-orange &quotorbs.&quot CIRCLING RED-ORANGE “ORBS”  At around 2 a.m., a co-worker and I went up on the roof of the 10-story building we worked swing shift in, taking binoculars along, as we were actually going to look for UFOs.  My co-worker was sure she was seeing a mother ship every night around this time when at home, and I was sure she was seeing an illusion created by looking at a bright star through the screen in her window through her binoculars.  We searched for her mother ship, but of course didn’t find it. We turned to leave, and what we saw nearly gave us heart attacks.  Not having been there only a minute before, at about a 90-degree angle were 7 or 8 “orbs,” I’ll call them, to the north, above the nearby mountaintop. They were in, and remained in, a group, but meandered among each other, mostly in a circular motion.  I call them “orbs,” but really they didn’t seem round through and through. The “apparent” size was about the size a dinner plate would appear if you held it out at arm’s length.  What was strange was that our binoculars couldn’t focus on any of them. All we got was fuzzy light when the binoculars were aimed on them.  After a couple of minutes, the group slowly started off toward the west, the direction of the ocean. As it got further away, a V shape took place of the objects, like a flock of ducks would form.  But here’s the peculiar thing. When the formation was quite a ways away, the binoculars could focus in a little better... and I would swear the objects now resembled creatures with wings flapping slowly... almost like winged dragons...   .and I felt our minds were being played with. And the formation  simply moved out of sight...slowly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Third sighting of yellowish/orange lights over Burbank / N. Hollywood Area.;2003-01-10 21:45:00;15 Minutes;Third sighting of yellowish/orange lights over Burbank / N. Hollywood Area. This is the third sighting of these exact same type of flying objects.  They appear on friday nights in the sky over Burbank/North Hollywood Area.  The first sighting was one flying object on 11/29/02 by 3 people. Two objects were seen on December 12/20/02 by 2 people.  Three objects were seen on 1/10/03 by 2 people.  In all situations the yellowish/orange objects would fly from east to west in a controlled manner.  Eventually the objects would stop, flash, and disappear.  I work close to the airport in that area and have a good idea of elevation.  I can say that they are a little higher than commercial aircraft.  On 1/10/03 I called the burbank polic dept. to ask if there had been inquiries or if they knew of activity in the area and they had no data for any of the dates I mentioned. ((NUFORC Note:  The sighting does not seem consistent with advertising lights, but we observe that the three sightings all occurred on Friday nights.  That suggests to us that they might be part of a recurring event, probably human related.  PD));34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Bright Object Floating In Sky..;2016-11-21 00:05:00;20;Bright Object Floating In SKy Last night a beaming bright light was shining through my upstairs window.  I live near the Holiday Inn in Burbank.  I thought it was a movie set, but as I looked closer it was not.  It looked like an oval object.  A large bright light in the center, and it hurt to stare at.   I tried to obstruct my view a little, and saw red flames or boxes around the bright light.  It appeared to get closer, but still far away.   It hung out in the sky for twenty minutes.  Then it just lowered itself out of sight and never to be seen again.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
