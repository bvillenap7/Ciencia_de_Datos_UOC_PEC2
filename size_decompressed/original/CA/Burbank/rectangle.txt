Very black rectangular craft seen for over one minute, over the 134 Fwy in Burbank, California.;2015-03-12 10:08:00;2 minutes;Very black rectangular craft seen for over one minute, over the 134 Fwy in Burbank, California. I was driving on the 134 fwy Westbound coming up towards the Hollywood Way, Burbank, CA, overpass.  As I was looking through the Studio side of Burbank, where the Disney building is, I saw the non-reflective deep black triangle hanging diagonally, further on over the 134, not as far as Cahuenga Blvd, but well beyond Pass Ave.   In the sky it was at about an angle of 9 o'clock.  It seemed to be stationary.  It was rotating around its lengthwise axis, but remaining mostly diagonal.  From my perception it was of a 2:5 ratio triangle at first, but it turned gradually into a diagonal black line as it rotated.  I passed under a second freeway overpass (Pass Avenue, Burbank over the 134 fwy), so it was much further away than the half mile or so that I traveled, and also I have some memory of how much larger the craft became as I approached, which was not much.   While I was coming up from under the Pass Ave overpass I saw what looked like the moon, in the western sky, very faint.  I don't know if this was the moon, but I was thinking how strange and wispy it looked if it was.  It's funny that when you see one unusual object, other objects become suspect even when they are not. I never heard any sound from the object, but I must have been pretty far away. When I first saw the object it was 3/5 the size of the sun in the sky, and it grew to about the size of the sun or bigger, apparently due to my getting closer so it did get slightly larger. So assuming the object was not growing or shrinking this should indicate how big the actual craft is. This is why I didn't have the sense that it was giant, but it did seem to be larger than 30 feet long. Over the course of 45 seconds its angle changed such that it was getting quite thin, but I still could see it.  In another 30 seconds it got too thin to see, and as this happened it appeared to begin to move northward, towards North Hollywood. Obama is speaking nearby today, and arrived at the Burbank Airport here, so this could have been some sort of military drone craft, but it would be interesting to hear about it, since it appeared to be quite a bit larger than a small plane at least. What was so unusual was how black and non-reflective it was, giving the impression of a very high tech finish.  Also, it was quite strange the way it hung at such a weird diagonal angle, before rotating out of view.  How long I saw it for is hard to say but I'm guessing between 1 and 2 minutes.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
