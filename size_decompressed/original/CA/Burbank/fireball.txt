Meteor Flash 90 degress down, at about 2000 feet.;1998-11-05 18:15:00;1 second;Meteor Flash 90 degress down, at about 2000 feet. At 6:15 driving  North  on the Golden State Freeway in Burbank, my hometown, my sister and I both saw what was probably a meteor flash down at about a 90 degree angle to earth. At late twilight it was almost dark, but no stars could be seen because of the hazy sky.  It was a flash, but it seemed very close, as there are foothills of a few hundred feet in the background, it seemed to be at only a few thousand feet high traveling perpendicular to the horizon, maybe finally disentigrating (?) at 2 thousand feet,  as I could see the bright trail and a burnout to slightly orange. This object should definitly show on radar as it was aproximatly over the Burbank Airport, (former home of Lockheed's Skunkworks). and definitly seemed in airspace of planes in take off/landing patterns at the time.  A call to the airport only got me a referral to local FAA Public relations line, which I did not call.At 6:15 driving  North  on the Golden State Freeway in Burbank, my hometown, my sister and I both saw what was probably a meteor flash down at about a 90 degree angle to earth.

Greenish Fireball seen over south Burbank CA.  1 second duration.;2001-08-06 20:30:00;1 second;Greenish Fireball seen over south Burbank CA.  1 second duration. Early eveing I was looking south, twilight blue sky, cotten cloud background. Turned my head and saw a bright greenis-yellowish flash like a fireball travel about 1 mile in the close atmosphere. I know it was close because two private planes were in the air on a regular flight path above and behind the object.  A Southwest airlines was just taking off from Burbank airport and facing the object, if anyone corraborates. It was traveling about Mach 5, about 2 miles south of me about 4000 feet high. I believe I heard a psssst type of sound produced by it. I am familiar with the flight patterns here and Mars was visible in the background.  It was NOT any of these objects.  Because of the peripheral objects, I know this object was traveling horizontaly close in our atmoshphere, not at the outer edges of it.  I saw the beginning and end of the whole trail.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
New Year's Eve Two Fireballs Move SLOW across sky in CA;2003-01-01 00:01:00;4 minutes;New Year's Eve Two Fireballs Move SLOW across sky in CA It was New Year's Eve my family and I were down the street at our friends house. We all went outside to bang some pots and pans and shoot off our party poppers. During the celebration I looked up at a very clear sky and noticed two orange/red orbs glowing and moving very very slow across the sky one was in front of the other. (This wasn't the first time I had seen something like this, about 5 weeks ago my sister and I saw one just like it in the sky heading east across the sky)The orbs were traveling this time from the east heading west. As before when I watched the ball move across the sky sparks or fire of some sort, kind of like a sparkler, trailed off from the fireball. The shapes took a turn and started heading off to the north the they both burn out within five seconds of each other.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Fireballs hovering over Southern California;2003-01-12 01:30:00;?4 minutes;Fireballs hovering over Southern California My wife and I had just said goodnight to one of our friends, and immediately after she left she called on her cell phone to tell us to go outside and look up into the western sky. As we peered up we saw three fireballs, orangish in color, moving into various formations: vertical , triangular, and horizontal patterns. They did not move any  farther or closer during the four minutes that we saw them. They stayed in the same posistion in the western sky moving around in these semi-controlled patterns, and the night was clear as a bell (no clouds reflecting anything).They were 2-4 times brighter than the brightest star. Then, suddenly, they aligned so that we could only see one light. One of them appeared to drop quickly from the sky like a bottle rocket being shot downward, leaving a trail of sparks, then another, and the third just disappeared. Before all this ended I grabbed my video camera and managed to get about 30 seconds to one minute of tape. It certainly backs up my descrioption of the event, although the color off the fireball is absent. I am also aware that Vandenburg airforce base is in the direction we were looking, about 90 miles west/northwest of our location, and I have seen rockets launched from there numerous times. This was defintely not consistent with those. I have lived in  the Burbank/Glendale area for 32 years and never seen anything like this.  Unlike the other accounts this occurred very early Sunday morning.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
3rd sighting of fireballs over So Cal skies;2003-02-01 00:35:00;10 secs;3rd sighting of fireballs over So Cal skies This was now the 3rd sighting we had seen in the month of january. We also saw one on January 25th @ approximately 12:35 am moving from Northeast to Southwest. It was also shooting off flares as it moved very quickly before it disappeared. I haven't heard any sound from any of the crafts. At first I thought it was possibly military, but after reviewing many of the recent reports, I'm no longer convinced that is the case. My first sighting, the objects were in a fixed part of the sky, not traveling anywhere. The subsequent sightings were in an entirely different part of the sky and clearly traveling. I recorded about a minute of video my first sighting but have not been able to recorded the others. The latest sighting it appeared to be moving away from us to the north, and also shot flares downward before disappearing. I would really appreciate a response if you could.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244

I actully saw one on two separate occassions this past saturday within about one hour of each other. They were  in the northeastern sky @ about a 45ยบ angle and not really traveling across the sky. Just sort of drifting upward. The other sightings had much more active movements.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Fifth sighting of red/orange lights that drop or shoot sparks and then disappear.;2003-02-17 22:20:00;5 min;Fifth sighting of red/orange lights that drop or shoot sparks and then disappear. This is our fifth sighting.  Pulsing red/orange light(s) moving independently.  In each sighting one or two craft(s) hover, shoot off or drop sparks, and then fade and disappear.

UFO over Burbank is just a clear bag with 4 burners;2003-03-30 21:00:00;10 minutes;UFO over Burbank is just a clear bag with 4 burners I have some bad news, the orange ball that we have been seeing over Burbank is what looks like a plastic bag with 4 burners on the bottom. It just flew right past my apartment. I had seen it in the past along with everyone else and didn't know what it is until tonight. I got a really good look at it. It was about 40 feet from my balcony.  I'm sorry guys. ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC has received several reports about the objects in the vicinity of Burbank, and many claims as to what they are.  However, if they are, indeed, pyrotechnic devices, then the officials in the area should make an effort, we believe, to apprehend whoever it is who is launching the alleged hot air balloons.  There may have been many of them that have been launched since December 2002, and they pose a significant fire risk, we believe.  It is unclear to us that they are, in fact, pyrotechnic devices, and we note that no one has taken the time to photograph the objects.  PD));34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Stationary Red Glow Caught On Mini DV Cam.;2003-08-20 00:15:00;approx. 6 Minutes;Stationary Red Glow Caught On Mini DV Cam. I was standing in my backyard sky gazing as usual when I noticed a very bright, bigger than a planet or star round red glow in the sky to the northwest of my location. I ran inside and grabbed my Mini DV Cam, it has a 440x digital zoom, and started pushing in on the object. It became clear very quickly as the camera focused on the object(s) that it was made up of a very large piece in the center that sort of resemble the shape of the state of Texas with other red glowing particles around it. at one point a piece maybe 2 percent of the size of the big piece shot off toward camera left. I went inside to grab a tri pod and when I came back it was slowly drifting west by north out of sight.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Bright orange light over Burbank, CA Feb 4, 2007;2007-02-04 19:30:00;2 min;Bright orange light over Burbank, CA Feb 4, 2007 My wife and I were walking our friends dogs when my wife said what's that in the sky?.  When I looked up I saw a orange bright ball in the sky.  We were near Burbank Airport, so I thought it was a plane coming in for a landing, but there were no flashing lights typical for planes.  Then I noticed how slowly it was moving and it was slightly wobbling, moving left and right as it traveled.  This lasted for about 1 minute or so.  The object then stopped and hovered for about 15-20 seconds when it began to flicker.  It then ejected a smaller object.  It then began to fade in the sky.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Glowing reddish fireballs gather to form V shape;2012-05-20 20:45:00;20 seconds;glowing reddish fireballs gather to form V shape At approx 8:45pm a few of us were following each other to a near by Menchi's to get some yogurt after church service in Burbank. We were all waiting at a red light heading West on Magnolia and Hollywood Way. I look up out my front window and notice about 4-6 bright red lights that seemed to look like red stars. My first thought was that it was probably some aftermath of the lunar eclipse that took place earlier today. That was until I noticed them begin to move. They didn't move in a linear way like an airplane or jet would, and they didn't flash or shimmer like a helicopter or any other aircraft would. I begin to see them gradually separate from each other, some in slower speeds than others. There were 5 of us that all caught this sighting. The rest of my friends had said they had seen 6 red stars that formed the shape of a &quotV&quot gradually disperse over a period of about 10-15 seconds. Background of observers: four of out five of us are males (ages 21, 30, 30, and 43).  the fifth person is a female the age of 21. We are also devout Christians.  Two of us are students (one a grad student) and the other two work in shipping/receiving, the other is a financial aid officer, and the female is a teacher's aid.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Red/orange fireball seen in the night sky over Burbank, CA;2012-10-09 23:45:00;5 minutes;Red/orange fireball seen in the night sky over Burbank, CA A couple of friends and I were siting outside a hookah bar, and we noticed a red/orange fireball in the sky moving slowly.  No noise at all.  It was the size of a dime and it was very obvious to everyone else at the hookah bar that it was something out of the ordinary.  It continued on a westward path then after a few minutes the red flare or light coming from it dimmed and turned off but you could still see the object continuing on its path.  It kept going until it was out of our sight.  Object looked grey in color since it stood out with in the dark night sky.

We saw a glowing, pulsating bright red and golden light.  ((anonymous report));2016-10-08 23:30:00;3 minutes;Was gazing at the huge golden half moon low on the horizon with my fiance this evening, when all of a sudden we saw a glowing, pulsating bright red & golden light moving towards us from west to east where we were standing.  It looked like a flickering glow, getting larger and moving fast, then slower.  We made sure to keep our eyes on it the whole time so as not to see it disappear when it went behind the trees.  Then it slowed way down and hovered high above us still flickering & sparkling till it came to a complete stop.   Then within 30 seconds, it started to slowly fade until we could no longer see it anymore.  Like it was dimming down a little at a time until it was gone.   Didn't see any shapes, was a extraordinary and we could hardly believe what we were seeing.  It was spectacular to witness.
