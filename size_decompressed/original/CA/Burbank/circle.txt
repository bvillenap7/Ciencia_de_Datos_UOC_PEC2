RED FURRY BALL LIGHT ROAMING THE MOUNTAINS;2004-08-15 10:00:00;1-2 minutes;RED FURRY BALL LIGHT ROAMING THE MOUNTAINS While on the plane flying back from Vegas on a 9:15, 15 mins to the flight I looked down at the green hills and mountains before the Burbank area.  I notice the lakes, the size, (i love observing land shapes beneath me), anyways I spotted a red giant ball shape ( in flame type on top of a mountain), I thought it was a fire truck, (I realze Im so high into the sky) that it can't be, because I just passed some waters, and they are only a size of half my plans...The red light ball rolled down the mountains, travel between the hills, up another mountain, traveled on top of the ridges, and disappeared...What got my attention was the spead it went up the mountian, and how fast it traveled in the terrain...;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Five orange lights appear over San Fernando Valley, CA.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possible party lanterns??  PD));2008-01-01 00:00:00;5 minutes;Five orange lights appear over San Fernando Valley, Ca at five mintues after New Years Eve. At five minutes after midnight, my husband, son and I all saw five orange lights hanging in the western sky over the San Fernando Valley.  After five minutes, each orange light faded out one by one. Two of the lights hung just above the other three which were in a straight row.  None of the lights ever moved.  As we each looked through binoculars for a closer look, we couldn't make out any kind of form or craft. We weren't able to get video of the event. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible party lanterns, but that is a guess.  Many other reports.  PD));34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244

A small plane flew underneath it heading south east so i new this wasn't a plane cause the ufo was way too high.Ufo then started to move north but very slowly.  I know it wasn't a helicopter or a plane.  To get a better idea of the  location of the where the the ufo was hovering over just google map, N Glenoaks Blvd & Birmingham Rd Burbank, CA 91504.

Red orbs crossing horizon.;2016-01-29 21:27:00;9 minutes;Red orbs crossing horizon. Burbank, CA.  On January 29, 2016, between 21:27 and 21:36 PST, ten solid, unblinking, red-orange orbs, about three times larger and twice as bright as Venus, some with vertical lines approximately one orb diameter (possible optical illusion), were observed by self and adult son crossing 45 to 90 degrees across horizon becoming visible at ~150 degrees SSE through between 210 and 280 degrees SSW at approximately 30 degrees above horizon with slight increase in elevation during travel.   Event may have begun before I noticed.  All appeared to originate from same point in SE and each disappeared from view at different points.  Fade out took between one and five seconds.  Earlier orbs appeared to travel greater distance while later ones disappeared from view after covering shorter path.  Each remained visible for over a minute and three to four were visible at a time.   No frame of reference to determine velocity or range.   I have over 30 years USAF and these did not resemble any rocket/missile or afterburner that I have seen.;34.1809870370375;-118.3303832244
Last week we saw this similar object.  One round glowing yellow orb.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a planet??  PD));2018-07-03 22:59:00;>10 minutes;Last week, we saw this similar object.  One round glowing yellow orb. I tried taking as clear as possible pictures, and a small video clip.  We saw from Granada Hills, and looks like it's around Burbank or Glendale area.  Last week it was much closer and we were able to hear some clicking sounds.  It is hovering over the city just like last week.  But this time we saw it sooner.  Last week it moved at a steady pace like a plane, but then it stopped.  No other blinking lights like regular aircrafts, like the blue and red, only the yellow glowing orb.  After 15-30 seconds the light lost energy and disappeared.  As of right now it is 23:13 and it's still around that area.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a planet, we wonder??
