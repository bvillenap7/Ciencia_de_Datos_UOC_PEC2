A strange light in the sky appeared to warp out of sight.;1986-06-01 22:00:00;30-45 seconds;A strange light in the sky appeared to warp out of sight. It was a warm evening. I don't remember the date, or even the year exactly. It was most likely 1986.  I was on a date with my girlfriend, Victoria (Tristan) Poetzel. It was about 9 or 10 pm and we were returning to my house. I pulled into the driveway in front of my parents home. I got out of the driver's side, and looked up toward the night sky. I noticed a small dim white light that was no larger or brighter than the light from the dim stars that were visible that night. The light tracked very slowly, in a straight line, due south.  My first thought was how it reminded me of the satellites we used to watch move slowly across the sky as we layed in our sleeping bags on the camping trips of my youth. They were dim, and moved slowly in a straight lines across the night sky. But this was in the city, on the street, surrounded by streetlights, at sea level. I'd never noticed a satellite in those conditions before.  I said to Tristan, Hey, do see that light? What is it a satellite or something? I pointed in the right direction, and told there it was in the sky next to the tv antenna on the neighbor's house. I saw her look in the right direction, but she said nothing.  I wondered if she could even see it. She didn't like wearing her glasses all the time, and she was not wearing them now. Her eyesight was not that great.  We wathched for a moment longer in silence and suddenly, to my surprise, the light appeared to oscillate wildly back and forth perpendicular to the direction of its travel, kind of like the needle of a sismograph, and then it was just gone.  I was stunned. Nothing I was aware of could move like that. I quickly looked toward Tristan, and in perfect unison we both said, Did you see...  She had been able to see it after all, and we had both witnessed its odd departure. We went inside and explained what we'd seen to my parents.  As UFO stories go it's pretty boring. No huge craft. No big headed aliens. But, we saw what we saw, and I can't explain what it was. I'm a skeptic myself, but this story is the God's Honest Truth and I'd take a lie detector test in a minute to prove it.  Unfortunately, Tristan and I broke up in 1988. I haven't seen her in years, and I don't know if she recalls what we saw. But I know I'll never forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
