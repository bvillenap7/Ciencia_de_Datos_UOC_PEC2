They were bright round objects huffering over the water;1983-03-22 13:00:00;2 min;They were bright round objects huffering over the water   7-1-2011  First of all, am not a crazy, lonely, emotional person seeking fame or money?    After seeing this with my friend I didn’t tell anybody not even my family.  I just told them a couple years ago,  I don’t know about my friend,  I haven’t seen him since we worked together. Here is goes:   It was a Sunday afternoon around 3 to 4 o’clock, we were taking a drive past a reservoir and then these round bright light objects were just huffering (sic.  Hovering)) over the water, then stayed there about 2 to 3 minutes.  Then they took off over the mountains, they took off at an incredibly speed.  I can’t even guess how fast they took off, but I know this, there is nothing on this planet that can go that fast. THAT’S IT ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));37.4367035714286;-121.895708035714
The UFO was VERY CLOSE to the ground, it was perhaps 60-70 ft over the freeway;2003-04-28 07:25:00;2-3 minutes;This sighting was on the freeway 680 north towards sacramento. I'm not sure how many witnesses there were since we had to keep driving after we saw it. Many people who were able to pull over did pull over to watch it. The UFO was VERY CLOSE to the ground, it was perhaps 60-70 ft over the freeway. It hovered in one spot and rotated it self in circles and on its side. The UFO was circular and the bottom had lights in a design that looked almost like a flower of some sort. It was spinning. The bottom was spinning one way and the top part was spinning the other. The UFO was of a grayish color with yellow lights. Only one was seen. After we had passed the UFO, I quickly turned around to continue watching it. It hovered for about another 10 seconds, and then it started to light up and emit a bright light, and then all of a sudden, I saw a blue streak of light and it was gone. The speed at which it traveled was beyond imagination. There seemed to be no noise coming from the UFO, as thought it was just floating there and there was no engine that was helping it fly. ((NUFORC Note:  We are unsure as to whether the sighting occurred in the morning, or the evening.  The witness describes self as having considerable technical and practical experience.

small winking light traveled across sky, then stopped and hovered;2008-01-23 02:30:00;20 minutes;small winking light traveled across sky, then stopped and hovered At approximately 2:30 am, I spotted a small light traveling across the sky flashing blue and red lights. As many airports are near my location, I can differentiate between planes and other objects. As stars cannot move at the rate of speed that the UFO did, it is safe to say that it can be ruled out as well.  There was no discernable shape, it appeared that the UFO was at least 50 miles north of my position, maybe more. It first appeared that it was going west, however, as soon as I spotted it, it began going southwest. 30 seconds later, as it was just about to exit my line of sight (I was viewing it from my bedroom window), it stopped and hovered for about twenty minutes.  It then disappeared without a trace. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));37.4367035714286;-121.895708035714
We saw a orange/yellow circle shaped object  traveling through the sky as fast as a shooting star;2009-10-23 23:16:00;5 seconds;We saw a orange/yellow circle shaped object  traveling through the sky as fast as a shooting star On Oct. 23rd 2009 (yesterday) I was with two other friends(we are all university students) waiting for a movie to start near a apartment complex. Around 11:16pm, while having a conversation with my friends I had my head up slightly glancing at the sky. At first I thought I saw a shooting star, and excitedly told my friends, but the duration of the object was in the sky for about 5 seconds, and logically we ruled out the fact it was a shooting star. My two friends saw the last 3 seconds of the object before it went away. They said they saw it suddenly shifted to the right before it vanished. We ruled out that it was a jet or any human aircraft because of the speed it was traveling, no human aircraft could be going that fast. It looked like a shooting star but there was no tail or trail, it was as if the object was a big subtle orange/yellow light traveling through the sky.
