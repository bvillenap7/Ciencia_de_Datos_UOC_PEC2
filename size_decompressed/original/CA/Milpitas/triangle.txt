July 2,2004  Bright glowing triangle[ or falling star] falling against the mountains .;2004-07-02 22:15:00;seconds;July 2,2004  Bright glowing triangle[ or falling star] falling against the mountains . We saw a glowing green, very bright, with a glowing yellow-white obscuring the green color as it plunged into the side of the mountain. It [was we called it, a falling star'] however, the unusual sight of it and the eerie shape could not be exactly triangle- but it was disappearing so fast, and it seemed to be on a fast out of control- perhaps a falling star dissapearing only seconds as it glowed green with yellow and white, then nothing, as it fell sharply fast! We called this a falling star. My boyfriend and I were both in the car and waiting at the red light, as we saw this very interesting sight! The points of the shooting star- or the triangle- as it was falling at a very fast rate, its points were bright yellow to white as it faltered to the mountain side. WE kid around about the shooting star must have some message for us as we oohed and ahhhhd the sight.[ The lime green seemed to be a slow down- just before it totally disappeared.] So,the the most interesting thing was it was coming down at a very sharp angle as it went from a arched acceleration on its way out of the night sky, and I said I wonder if we will hear about this on the news?;37.4367035714286;-121.895708035714
