White 3 sphere coupled object seen in Milpitas, CA capture on video.;2008-03-13 18:54:00;40 seconds;White 3 sphere coupled object seen in Milpitas, CA capture on video. Camera used for video: Canon 12.1 mega pixels  Power Shot A650IS. Time: 6:54 p.m. on March 13, 2008. Zoom factor: 6X optical only (no digital zoom)  The video submitted and included in this report  Viewing location: 37 deg 24'37.29N - 121 deg 54'49.42W. I was looking east toward the Diablo Range and in the area between Alum Rock and Mt Hamilton. A white three-sphere coupled object came in view. It was traveling a straight line path NNE just past Mt Hamilton. It seemed to be about 2 or three miles distant. I captured about half of my sighting on video which I have submitted for review and analysis  On March 21 I sighted a similar object of the same color and in approximately the same area. I was looking toward the east. It was longer by about 3 times. (to clarify I would sketch it at ¼ inch wide and 1 ½ inches long. It was at approximately 25-30 degrees high. I was not able to distinguish any features as in the previous sighting of the 13th, although it was much closer and clearer. I viewed the object for 3 -5 seconds before I lost it due to trees. The object was traveling south toward Mt Hamilton. I do not know of any other witnesses other than myself. END OF REPORT.;37.4367035714286;-121.895708035714
Similar white dots seen in NYC seen in Milpitas CA;2010-10-12 10:00:00;5 minutes;Similar white dots seen in NYC seen in Milpitas CA Having my morning tobacco break at about 10 AM I looked up to see one of the aircraft that was only minutes out of San Jose Airport when I noticed two points of light moving two or three full moon widths apart slowly drifting in a west to east direction.  At first I thought they were coasting gulls and wondered why they would be so high. I watched as long as my eyes could discern them disappearing over the Diablo range of mountains.  Looking straight up again I observed two - four more of the white dots drifting in the same direction.  At one point one of them appeared to be tumbling.  I then noticed a large jet aircraft flying at an intermediate altitude also west to east along the same line.  I thought it very unusual to see an aircraft at that altitude traveling west to east.  Typically the aircraft have just taken off from San jose where they make a 180 degree turn to the south  or they are lining up to land at Oakland in the north. After the tumbling observation I wrote it off as spider webs.  Told my wife about it when I got home and thought that was the end of the story.  This morning I caught a glimpse of a video clip on google news (news organization not remembered) about the sightings over NYC.  While the clip focused on what appeared to be cluster of balloons, at the very end there was a brief shot of these white dots in sky. Seeing the similarity I had to tell someone. Does this make sense to you? ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS)) Sorry about this, but I just filed a report about the white dots over Milpitas and I believe I got the day wrong.    I reported Wednesday, but I believe the sighting might have been Tuesday.  I remember wishing I had my glasses but my glasses were in my truck, which was in the shop on Tuesday. Like I said I thought they were spider webs until seeing the NYC videos.  It registered in memory but not clearly. so this makes the report somewhat questionable but what can you do with a 58 year old memory.;37.4367035714286;-121.895708035714
