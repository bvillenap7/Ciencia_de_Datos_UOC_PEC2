A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL I COULD NOT SLEEP THE FRIDAY NIGHT OF THAT ESTIMATED DATE.  IT WAS A WEEK LATER AFTER EASTER.  I WOKE UP BECAUSE MY CAT WAS HISSING AND MEOWING. MY GOLDEN RETRIEVERS WERE BARKING AIMLESSLY AT THE LIGHT RIGHT ABOVE THE HILLS OF PIEDMONT ROAD.  IT WAS HUGE.  THERE WERE NO STARS THAT WERE AROUND 3 OR FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER.  THERE WERE SO MANY BRIGHT YELLOWISH, REDISH, AND ORANGISH COLORS.  THERE WAS NOT MOON, AND NO AIRPLAINS WERE FLYING THAT EARLY IN THE MORNING AT THE SAN JOSE AIRPORT. I GOT FRIGHTENED SO I WOKE MY 12 YEAR OLD BROTHER, KYLE, AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS, HE SAID IT WAS THE MOON YOU ARE LOOKING AT.  WELL, THAT NIGHT WAS A NEW MOON.  WHICH OBVIOUSLY MEANS NO MOON IN SIGHT.  CAN YOU HELP ME EXPLAIN THIS SITUATION? I CAN'T GET IT OUT OF MY MIND NOT KNOWING WHAT IT WAS, OR IF IT IS AN ALIEN SPACECRAFT.  THANK YOU. ((Deleted)) 6125. PLEASE CONTACT ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE UNEXPLAINED OBJECT LIGHT FLYING IN THE SKY.;37.4367035714286;-121.895708035714
