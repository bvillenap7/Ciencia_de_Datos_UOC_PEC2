They were not moving like a plane, but side to side and vertically up and down. They were also morphing. Then out of no where, there was a sudden bright amber light that formed a triangle with the other 2 objects. This one was moving the same way but much faster. It seemed to get closer and closer to us. It almost seemed to be following us out of the hills. Once we got to the bottom of the hills, it disappeared. On the way back home, we noticed an amber light on our right side bouncing up and down, and left and right, but not moving anywhere. Shortly after watching that light 2 government planes(low profile planes, very secretive like, one strobe light per plane)were headed towards the light. The light just disappeared, but reappeared on our left side(many many miles apart) in like a second.;37.4367035714286;-121.895708035714
