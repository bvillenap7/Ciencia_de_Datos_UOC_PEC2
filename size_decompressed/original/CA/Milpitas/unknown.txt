I saw something in our sky on 9/21/03 (midday). Strange. White object not unlike a roll of paper falling. It was headed downward at a 30 degree angle against a horizon line. It was not easy to see. I had to stare at the same area to actually see the object because it would seem to not be there if just glanced at. This thing wasn't falling. There was no tumbling like one would expect from something that had no wings. It had a long tapering tail and was moving in an eel like motion as if it was swimming in the air. It was difficult to track visually . If you looked away it would be difficult to locate again. There were a few more of these objects appearing centrally from great altitude. This was not a saucer of plane or helicopter. My brother said a jet from Moffett flew through the general area where these objects were appearing. The jet slightly lost control, regained control then flew off. It may have sucked one into the engine intake. Oh, these things weren't small. Couldn't determine the size as there was no reference object to gauge the size. Weird. I can still envision these things. I have yet to see anything like it. It is possible that there are other life forms out there. They may not need space craft and these may not actually be visiting. We may be running into these things as our world travels through space and these space eels live in space like fish in water.;37.4367035714286;-121.895708035714
