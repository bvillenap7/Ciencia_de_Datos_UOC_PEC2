Looked out my back window and saw bright yellow light flying in over our mountains ont the west side of Pala reservation.  I then grabbed my phone and started recording.  I noticed that it looked like it could be something on fire, but as it got closer to my house I could see that it had some type of solid looking para suit on the top of it. I also knew for some reason I can not explain that, whatever it was noticed me and my girlfriend watching it.  It came from the west and headed east towards palomar mountain.  It made no sound and it was very big, flying pretty low but high enough to clear the mountain.  I did not chase it or try to track it because I was told that it was (Taquitz) a ball of death!!! It was in my view for about 2 min!!!;33.3815;-117.072
