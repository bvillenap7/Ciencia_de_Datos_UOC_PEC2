Elongated reddish orange lights traveling from East to West in Northern California just after midnight New Year's 2014;2015-01-01 00:10:00;15-20 minutes;Elongated reddish orange lights traveling from East to West in Northern California just after midnight New Year's 2014 At approximately midnight and about 15-20 minutes after midnight (New Year's), 6 or 7 elongated reddish orange lights moved slowly across the sky from East to West.  With binoculars the shape of each object seemed to be elongated rectangular with an aura of soft white light surrounding the top in an arc shape.   The first two lights at first appeared to be large wingtip lights but then several other lights followed the first two in a one-by-one procession.  There was no sound, they moved rather slowly, no jerking and it was difficult to determine how high up in the sky the objects flew.   At the exact point in the sky, overhead from the observation location, each light was no longer visible (faded/blinked out) when it arrived at that point.  The lights were spaced apart, not side by side except for the first two observed.  They did not travel in a line, but were staggered in formation.   No photo was taken because no smartphone or camera available with night photo capacity.   A map and possibly drawing will be forwarded via email to ufocntr@nwlink.com.;39.9279;-120.9697
