On a deer hunting trip in California 1984 close to Quency and the feather river in a mountainous area we camped in aarea called Humbug creek.Returning from a hunt my brother and I sat at our camp site it was 9:00am in the morning.My eyes focused on a craft moving in the airspace above us and I could not see any wings or here any motor noise.I said to my brother,what is that? I stated that I would get my binockulars and he should keep watching it.I ran to my truck and back again with the binockulars,my brother stated that whatever it was has dissapeered.What I had seen looked like a silver color and no shape outline was clear to me.My brother stated that as he watched it for the few seconds it just went to a blur and then disapeared.He said it appeared to have a cigar shape.That was it,all clear skies and it was gone.
