White orb seen over Quincy, California at 6 PM December 31st, 2005. Duration: 2 to 3 minutes.;2005-12-31 18:00:00;2-3 minutes;White orb seen over Quincy, California at 6 PM December 31st, 2005. Duration: 2 to 3 minutes. At about 6:00 PM my wife and I came out of our barn and saw a light in clouds to the west.  The light was white and could be seen dimming, and becoming brighter. The object exited the clouds, growing slowly in brightness until it was in the clear starry sky.  The slow brightening of the object showed how low the object was. A jet would have instantly appeared. This object was in the low surrounding clouds.  The object traversed from west to east, at about a 40-45 degrees above the horizon. We were facing north north west.  It had no blinking lights. It was white in color. The brightness remained constant upon exiting the clouds up until it disappeared into another cloud blank to the east.  The object made no sound. It was very quiet out. Our property had just flooded and we could hear wate trickling 50 yards away. We waited a few minutes but heard no sounds of a jet or a Cessna.  I looked for an exterior structure around the orb as it passed across the many stars. The stars remained constant. It was only a sphere with a slight haze surrounding it.  The speed was consistent with a jet at 30,000 feet, and much faster than a Cessna. We live within 3 miles of the local airport, so we are familiar with their night time speeds and flight patterns. Thsi was not a Cessna.  The object also had what I call a bob and weave motion to it. It did not fly in a completely straight trajectory. It seemed to have a slight bounce to it, though not noticable unless it was in close proximity to nearby stars.  I am very happy with this sighting. It is the first time that my wife and I have seen one together. The entire event lasted about 2 to 3 minutes.;39.9279;-120.9697
