I was panning for gold, at Cold Water Creek on our mining claim called the Jolly Roger.  I felt someone watching me, so I looked up and saw this craft, it was dark in color, and had 2 beings in it..They didn't seem to be wearing helmets.  We've had government jets flying over looking for marijuana plants, and I assumed that was what it was, so I waved at them, though at the time, they were looking forward, and not at me..Then the craft took off without a sound..;39.9279;-120.9697
trianglar craft, blink, and amber lights;2007-10-05 23:00:00;3-4 minutes;trianglar craft, blink, and amber lights At 11PM on Friday night, standing looking north north east, a group of lights approached my position. Color of the lights was amber and indistinct initially (just an amber glow). As lights approached, no sound was heard. In fact, no sound was heard at anytime. Lights flew at an almost 1 o'clock angle shy of overhead, with the wing of craft being nearly overhead. Shape of craft was a boomerang shape, with multiple amber colored lights that were around the perimeter of the object outlining its shape. Object was a craft as stars vanished in between the lights as it slowly moved overhead. Estimated height (though I had no reference point other than its initial appearance to the North north east and the known height of the mountain range in the background) would be about 2000 feet. Object slowly banked to the right, crossing through Perseus at about 50 to 60 degree in the sky, and then winked out. It just disappeared, What is interesting is that I was working at Sierra Pacific Industries. This was on my patrol and it flew nearly over the mill itself. SPI is the largest lumber mill on the west coast. Duration of event was about 3-4 minutes. Oddity of the incident (other than its appearance) was a sudden feeling of calmness just prior to it winking out.;39.9279;-120.9697
