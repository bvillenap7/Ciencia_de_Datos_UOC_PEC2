Decending large white object, vectors to the North and dissappears.;2001-06-23 21:04:00;10 seconds;Decending large white object, vectors to the North and dissappears. While stargazing on the North side of Bucks Lake, my wife and I saw a pinpoint of white light, suddenly increase in size( like a rapid decent), to a size we Estimate approx. 1/6 the size of a full moon. This occurred to the N-NE of our vantage point.(Open parking lot near beaches), at an azimuth of approx. 25' over the horizon. This large white light then made a rapid course correction by leveling off, then proceeded NNE very rapidly until out of sight. ( Report #1 of two that night). ((two names deleted)) of Roseville,Ca.;39.9279;-120.9697
Red light flares to brilliant white,changes course.;2001-06-23 23:15:00;60 seconds;Red light flares to brilliant white,changes course. While out stargazing, my wife and I observed a small red light moving overhead in an arc. We thought this to be a sattelite, and were duly impressed, but the object then changed color to brilliant white, increasing in magnitude by a factor of 10X, it then made a course change and changed headings from South to North- to a North-East heading. Rate of speed increased after course change, total legnth of sighting was no more than 60 seconds total. We were both stunned by the flare since we were both convinced it was a satellite until that point.;39.9279;-120.9697
6 objects in 50 minute duration: 4 lights and 2 dark objects;2007-10-07 20:00:00;30 minutes;6 objects in 50 minute duration: 4 lights and 2 dark objects This occurred on Monday night, October 7th, 2006. It began at 7:35 PM and lasted until 8:25 PM involving 4 separate objects, each seen at different times during the 50 minute duration.  The first object was seen at 7:35 PM as I was leaving for a security patrol. The object was seen by me and my co-worker, then later only by me.  The first object came from the south west and moved to the north east. This object was a white ball of light. It stopped 2 times completely, then continued across the sky very slowly.  There was a discernable darkness around the object. Though it did not pass over any major stars, there seemed to be a solid object and not just a light.  An airplane (a regular commercial airliner), about 3-4 minutes into this, came from the north west. Within 30 seconds of the airplane appearing, the light we had been following simply vanished.  I then went on my security patrol. About 5 minutes into the patrol, directly overhead, a small light appeared. It then began to grow in intensity and travel in a southerly direction, reaching a -2 or -3 magnitude, not quite the brightness of Venus.  At 8 PM, I reached about the midpoint in my security round. I saw another light, this time very dim, moving from south east to the north east, crossing through the constellation of Pegasus.  At 8:10 PM, I went to the same spot where the other security guard had seen a triangular UFO fly over him two nights before.  I saw nothing at this point, and left to continue my round.  A light caught my eye in the mountains to the north east. A very bright light near the top of the mountain range.  I went back to my previous position to get a better look. I am very familiar with this mountain range, even in the dark. More pointedly, the stars rise over this mountain range, giving a clear outline of mountains themselves.  If Venus is normally a magnitude of -4 to -5, this was a magnitude of -7 at least. This light/object moved up and down from the top of the mountains, into the sky about a degree or two.  It also moved side to side and two times, and twice increased in brightest and moved in such a way that I felt that it was approaching, however, it never did move overhead.  After calling the other guard about this object, and asking him to come out, it faded to the same magnitude of the star I was watching rise over the hill to its left. It then increased in magnitude and then vanished.  This is similar to another sighting I had on September 29th on an adjacent mountain range.  I was able to rule out a motorcycle or car headlight in that the light/object clearly moved above the horizon, something a normal vehicle could not do.  Once the other guard arrived, he noticed an aberration in the night sky. He pointed to it, and I saw it as well. 2 objects flying low in the sky. One that seemed to be darker than the night sky, traversing over the background stars and another ghostly object behind it that also obscured the stars in the background.  These objects came from the areas where the bright light had been and traveled beneath the constellation Pegasus in a north to east trajectory.  Not feeling comfortable about being in that location any longer, we then headed back to our office to complete the patrol.;39.9279;-120.9697
Circular light appeared instantly in the South, going East for 6 minutes;2007-11-04 05:23:00;6 minutes;Circular light appeared instantly in the South, going East for 6 minutes Circular light appeared instantly in the South. It continued toward the East for about 6 minutes. It was extremely slow. Magnitude of -1 or -2 at first, then down to +1 or +2. I was using Venus as a gauge for the magnitude as it was in the night sky at the time. These objects are seen at least twice a month by myself and co-workers, usually just after dusk or before dawn.;39.9279;-120.9697
Magnitude -8 ball of light seen for 2 minutes over Quincy, California, moving from west to north.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS confirmed.  PD));2009-05-10 22:02:00;2 minutes;Magnitude -8 ball of light seen for 2 minutes over Quincy, California, moving from west to north. This is the same object that I have seen for years. A white ball of light in the sky that moves silently with a distinct bobbing motion. Moving east from due west, the object then curved toward the north, turning slowly to the north directly under The Big Dipper. The object was very bright, around a magnitude -8. Venus is a magnitude -4.1. Iridium flares peak around -8, and this object was a consistent -8 until the last 30 seconds of its journey across the sky. This is one of many objects like this that I have seen and reported on over the years in this area. They are not satellites or planes. They make no noise at all. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS confirmed.  Witnessed watched for the ISS on the following night.  PD));39.9279;-120.9697
