I was sitting here at my computer with the window open right behind the monitor about 6 minutes ago. It is very dark outside. I looked up out the window and saw a greenish/blue ball of light shooting across the sky heading West and down. This is my first UFO sighting. I have researched UFOs almost daily for a few years and I am very excited. I know it is possible this is just a fireball meteorite but the blueish green glow looked very unfamiliar. It lasted for 2 seconds and disappeared. It started about 2 fist lengths (with arms out) from the West horizon and went west and down. It was very very bright. I hope others have seen this. If it was high enough, people in the California Valley probably saw it also. I live at 3,400 feet elevation in the Sierra Mountains near Reno.;39.9279;-120.9697
