My coworker and myself witnessed a cluster of nine steady (not flashing)lights north of Rocklin.  They were ascending into the night sky slowly and not in any recognizable formation.  As they ascended, they disappeared one by one.  I took a video with my cell phone but the camera couldn't pick up the lights. I called news 10 to make a report.;38.80607421875;-121.2573
