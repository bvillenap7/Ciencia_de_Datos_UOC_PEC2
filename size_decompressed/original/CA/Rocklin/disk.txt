Saucer spotted near Rocklin CA in clear, mid-morning. Observed for 20 minutes;2004-05-16 10:00:00;20 minutes;Saucer spotted near Rocklin CA in clear, mid-morning. Observed for 20 minutes Approximately 10am I noticed what I first thought was a helicopter hovering above but became curious when I didn't hear any sound. As I further observed it, the movements were not what one would expect from a helicopter. At that point I told my girlfriend to come out and observe what I was seeing. I didn't tell her what I thought it was... and she excitedly said it was a UFO. You could see the glint of the sun shine off of it as it turned various directions very slowly. It did not make any quick directional changes, but did appear to slowly turn and at times got verticle to our viewpoint showing that it was definitely saucer shaped. We got my binoculars and observed it for about 15 more minutes as it got further away. The only explanation outside of it being a UFO would have to be that it was an extremely large, saucer shaped mylar balloon. The coloring was either gray or silver. Difficult to tell at the distance it was from us. My girlfriend did take several pictures with her digital camera, but of course it only appears as a dot in the images.;38.80607421875;-121.2573
