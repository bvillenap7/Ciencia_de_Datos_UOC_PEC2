We saw two seperate orange balls of light in the northeastern sky, traveling slowly south... each one had 4-5 smaller glowing balls of light or flame falling below them.  They weren't meteors or falling stars, they moved horizontally... with the lights either going off or burning out.;38.80607421875;-121.2573
