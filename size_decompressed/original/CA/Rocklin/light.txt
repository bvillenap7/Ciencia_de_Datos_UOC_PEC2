Light seen over Auburn Ca.;2002-03-28 18:47:00;2 Sec.;Light seen over Auburn Ca. While driving east bound on I-80 in Rocklin I saw a light blue-green light.  At first I thought it was an aircraft but realized it was moving much too fast.  It moved from South to North.  I had an unobstructed view of the sky.  The light suddenly appeared and traveled downward at about a 30 degree angle to the horizontal until it disappeared at my horizon line but in front of the backdrop of the Sierra's.  It traveled in a straight line.  There were no red/green/white marker lights to be seen.  Had it been a meteor, it appeared to be headed for Auburn.  As I drove through the area, there was no emergency vehicle activity to be seen.  There are no airports in the area that could accomidate a plane that was this fast.  There was no tail indicating atmospheric ablating of material as should be seen from a meteor this low in the atmosphere.  After returning home at 19:20 I checked off my back deck for any signs of fire or other activity.  There were none.  From my back deck I can see about 50,000 acres of the Sierra Foothills along with the entire North Sacramento Valley. I am an engineer, amateur radio operator and pilot.;38.80607421875;-121.2573
Brilliant white light that pulsated, enlarged, pulsated again, faded and moved away.;2003-11-09 18:05:00;15 - 20 seconds;Brilliant white light that pulsated, enlarged, pulsated again, faded and moved away. At 6:05 PST, November 9, 2003.  I had gone outside onto my patio which faces eastward and was observing the moon.  I then glanced up to Mars and saw it clearly.  But about 5-10 degrees from Mars toward South, (nearly in line with Mars) was a brighter object that immediately caught my attention.  My first thought was it was a star, but brighter, whiter, and larger than Mars, and so close to Mars, and I wondered what star is that?  It appeared stationary, and then in a second it pulsated, with the white light becoming brighter, more brilliant, then pulsated again, slightly dimming some of the brilliance, then pulsated-enlarging again, to even larger than my original sighting, and then in another second or so, it began to fade and then I was aware of its movement away (southward) and slightly upward, and it faded out to a pin light before disappearing from my view.  My observation from beginning to end was approximately fifteen-twenty seconds.  Except for a few clouds scattered in the eastern sky, the sky was completely clear in that direction, around and above the object.  This object was not within the normal airplane flight pattern, which I often observe evenings as planes go into Sacramento from the North, (I observe those to the North of my position) or other planes that fly over.  I have never observed a plane in that position.  I heard no sounds, except some ducks, and because of the geography here, sounds normally carry far, whether it be a plane or helicopter in the area, the train several miles away, or coyotes, or cattle.  I believe what I saw was not a normal aircraft of any kind.;38.80607421875;-121.2573

Flashing Red Llight Over Rocklin, Ca;2012-06-27 23:00:00;30 minutes;Flashing Red Llight Over Rocklin, Ca I have seen the same lights several times in the past to weeks.  They are in the NW sky from my address.  Sometimes there are 4-5 lights, last night there were 2.  One was white, the other was amber and would turn red and start flashing.  The red flashing light was most visible and would flash and slowly and drift horizontally from side to side making it difficult to video.  Last night, at one point, a commercial jet flew towards the red flashing light.  The light moved over and became very small, and after the jet flew by, the light got bigger again and started flashing red. This light flashes red for a minute or so, stops and becomes amber, and slowly builds up to flashing red again.  I have seen this light in the night sky over the past two weeks as I am taking my dog out before I go to bed.  I've worked in aviation in the military and know this is not a helicopter, blimp, or airplane.  It makes no noise and has no flight path.  It's like it's just hangin! g out.  It's color is not super bright.  It's red like a stop light.  And, it's not a solid red.  I can see lines through the color and it's shape is not a circle or orb, it's shape is very interesting, almost like a winged creature.  Like a giant firefly.  There is definitely something going on that cannot be explained.  I hesitated to report this.  I don't know why others are not seeing this as it is very visible. One other point, it alternates it's flash with the other white light that I am also seeing.;38.80607421875;-121.2573
