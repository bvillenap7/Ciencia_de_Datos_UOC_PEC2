A bright glowing blue light appeared for just a split second off to our right and slightly ahead of us, which would have put it in the southeastern sky. It was about halfway up in the sky. It was more or less round in shape and glowing. It was very bright one second yet vanished into total darkness the next. It was fairly large, perhaps about half the size that a full moon appears when seen with the naked eye. The shade of blue was a light greenish blue or pale aqua color.;38.80607421875;-121.2573
Round Reflective Object Veiwed in Rocklin, CA at Approx. 6:10pm on August 22;2004-08-22 18:10:00;4-5 minutes;Round Reflective Object Veiwed in Rocklin, CA at Approx. 6:10pm on August 22 On Sunday August 22 at approximately 6:10pm, 3 others and myself were sitting outside on my balcony. I was sitting facing northeast and as always, I searched the skies for anomalies. I noticed an object at approximately 60 degrees above the horizon. The object appeared to be circular and reflective. As I was watching the object, I was trying to figure out if it was a balloon or perhaps a star. I pointed the object out to the 3 other people I was with (we all adults late 30’s to early 40’s) and 2 out of the 3 others were able to see it. As I was watching this object for a 4-5 minute period, I also noticed another fainter object the right at about 30 degrees higher.  The 2 others and myself were discussing what might this be (alternating looking at each other and back at the object) when out of my left peripheral vision I saw a reflective object move by at an accelerated speed. When I looked up to where I originally saw the object, the object was gone, as well as the fainter object. I am not sure if what I saw was the object itself moving swiftly by, or if it was something else like a translucent insect reflecting the sun light high up in the sky (I didn’t get a good feel on the actual altitude)?  I am just wondering if anyone else saw this object and I will keep checking back to see if anyone else reports anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Disklike object with rotating changing colors floating moderately low above the ground.;2010-07-29 22:20:00;5 minutes;Disklike object with rotating changing colors floating moderately low above the ground. The Craft was moderately low it was big enough to see all the lights and the shape but not down to small detail.  The craft rose up from below behind a tree and rose higher into the sky then started moving to the left side, while it was going up it had green flashing and circling neon colors, as it moved sideways the colors would change from neon green to neon red, to neon blue rotating in a circle, it went to the left then began turning and going towards the northwest, the houses began making it hard to see which direction it was going in, we began following it in our car but it had already disappeared.;38.80607421875;-121.2573
Two Unidentified Objects Flying in Sky Over Sacramento County on February 9, 2013, at Approximately 6:25pm.;2013-02-09 18:25:00;>1 hour;Two Unidentified Objects Flying in Sky Over Sacramento County on February 9, 2013 at Approximately 6:25pm Looking out to the Southwest direction from of the Western-facing window of my condominium in Rocklin, California, I saw two circular shaped objects in the sky. I first saw the objects at approximately 6:25pm.  They were very bright and seemed bigger than any airplane, helicopter or other aircraft.  They were several miles from me and were definitely flying over an area in Sacramento County.  They could have possibly been flying over Citrus Heights, California, Fair Oaks, California or even Rancho Cordova, California, depending on their distance from my home.  The objects were very bright and were mostly yellow-colored, but they occasionally changed to a green color, and even red.  They move in all directions and change direction quickly.  They appeared to stay relatively low to the ground, but they would sometimes fly higher up in the sky. F rom my window, I saw two other people on my street who were outside witnessing these two objects flying in the sky.  They wer! e capturing video footage of the objects on a cell phone, smartphone, or a similar device.;38.80607421875;-121.2573
