Daughter went outside to investigate. Saw nothing. Heard same sound off in distance 1 min. later. No engine sound. No helicopter sound. 06:30 hrs. Sat. 23 Oct 99 I was having a dream. I was looking up at a starlit night. I focused in on a triangular craft. (I saw a triangular craft 4 Apr 97) This craft started to bank and go in a small circle. (97 sighting - craft made no noise) I wanted to listen to the sound it was making. It sounded like a whosh of some sort. Much like the scarob in the game Riven. There was no engine sound, just the whosh like air was being fanned out of the way. The UFO in my dream got closer as it circled counter clockwise. Then it shot off. Later that morning after waking up I went out to the kitchen and my daughter asked me if I heard that sound. I was a bit surprised. She defined the same sound that I had in my dream with exact detail. Even the circling. It was such an unusual sound that my daughter ran outside to see if she could see anything. She heard the same sound from far off in the distance about a minute later. Keep in mind that she is 15 and still a little scared of the dark. But the sound was so loud and strange, she managed to go out back to search for it. We lived in this house for 12 years and NEVER heard anything like that. I've worked with trains, helicopters and lots of sound equipment and I never heard this sound.;38.80607421875;-121.2573
Large formation of lights in the sky at night at a pretty high altitude without any noise.;2016-09-25 19:45:00;30 minutes;Large formation of lights in the sky at night at a pretty high altitude without any noise. I went outside to put out the garbage Sunday night, it was dark, but a large formation of lights appeared to be traveling slowly in the sky.  It didnt count how many lights there were, but over 50.  They really stood out.  I yelled to my wife to come outside, she did, and she tried to take pictures, but they didnt come out.  Some of the lights were brighter than others.  They were traveling from the east to the west.   As they passed over the house, they began to turn in a southerly direction, but instead of staying in a formation, the turned and went single file.  Then they really accelerated and disappeared pretty quickly.  They were pretty high in the sky, and I never heard a sound.  When the sighting was over, my wife and I were talking about what we saw, and the next door neighbor walked up to us and said did you see that, and pointed to the sky.  So he saw it too!;38.80607421875;-121.2573
