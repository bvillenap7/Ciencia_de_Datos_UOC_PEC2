Only in the redwoods night saucer!!!!!!!!!!!  ((anonymous report));2018-07-15 22:30:00;10 seconds;Only in the redwoods night saucer!!!!!!!!!!! I walked out to the back porch to dance to the moon like I do every night.  As I looked up at the almost full moon, I noticed to the right a cloud which had a circular craft with three red lights around it (which didn't look like an airplane) heading to the left from the cloud towards the moons direction, then the lights disappeared and I saw this silhouette of the craft glideing towards the moon.   Just before it was supposed to cross in front of the moon, it vanished in front of my eyes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
