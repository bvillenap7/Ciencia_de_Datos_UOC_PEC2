Bright object with twin gas jets that got longer over time.  ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris??  PD));2018-02-06 18:29:00;2 minutes;Bright object with twin gas jets that got longer over Time. Carlotta, CA February 6, 2018 18:29 to 18:30 PM Pacific standard time. Looking south about 30 degrees above the horizon I observed a glowing object.  With binoculars I was able to make out two short gas jets.  It moved southeast and as it approached the horizon the two gas jets became much longer.  I think it could be a booster rocket reentering the atmosphere.  It started out bright and small and became much longer with twin tails and more diffuse.  At its longest it was about 1/2 degree long (about the width of the moon).  It got to about magnitude -2 or -3 quite a much brighter than Sirius.
