Flashing, hovering light moving multiple directions in one area of the sky.;2017-12-08 21:00:00;10+ minutes;Flashing, hovering light moving multiple directions in one area of the sky. For the past 2 nights, between 9-10 pm PST, I've noticed what I thought was a bright and twinkling star near the bottom left of Orion.  Both times, this bright light appeared to hover and subtly move in different directions, diagonal movements being most noticeable.  It stayed in the same little area and didn't make any sudden movements at all. It appears to flash multiple colors and be extremely far away. I pulled out my phone to use my SkyMap tonight, to see if there was a corresponding planet or star, and the app kept malfunctioning..  Which is unusual. From where I am at, the light was straight in the direction of Mt. Shasta. I thought maybe I was just tired last night, but when my friend saw it tonight,  that confirmed it for me. Both nights I watched it for a good 10-15 mins before I got too cold and went in.;41.9077;-122.5265
