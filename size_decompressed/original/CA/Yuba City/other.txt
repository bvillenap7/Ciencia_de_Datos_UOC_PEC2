It was 11:45 PM and I had just gone to bed. I closed my eyes and slowly drifted off to sleep. Just as I was on the verge of sleep, I opened my eyes and looked out the window. I looked up at the stars and noticed something. It looked as if it was a star, but with very sudden, swift movements. At first I thought that it was my tired eyes playing a trick on me, so I blinked a couple of times and rubbed them. I looked again, and the object was still moving in a straight line but I noticed some jerking motions, like it went forward then went backward. I thought I was just imagining it, so I closed my blinds. I then, out of curiousity, opened the blinds again. And I saw the same object, maybe a different one, I can't be sure, traveling in and upward direction. I have never turned my back on this sort of thing and like to keep an open mind, but I never expected to see this type of phenomena.;39.1139891304348;-121.633660869565
