Boomeranged/stealth bomber shape, silent, no lights or sound, massive size;2010-09-15 00:00:00;30 seconds;Boomeranged/stealth bomber shape, silent, no lights or sound, massive size Boomeranged/stealth bomber shape, silent, no lights or sound   Back in the summer of 2010, late evening, I was outside having a smoke on a patio chair. I slowly tilted my head back to look at the night sky and if I had not, I would have completely missed it.  I still have a hard time trying to estimate its size when I think of it. It was flying very low and was massive (about 4 football fields in length or larger) directly overhead. It made no sound or lights, blending with the night sky. The first thing that came to mind when I saw the shape was a stealth bomber but as I studied it, the two bottom corners were rounded like a boomerang and it came in on the back to a flat edge (not full triangle). The coloring is hard to describe. I had to stare really hard to make out what looked like a camo pixel design of dark greys and blacks, but not painted, more like each color was a separate panel. It was flying fast enough that this only lasted about 30 seconds (despite its size) before disappearing into the dark after passing overhead. During the entire time I had not moved and felt like almost numb as I watched it. I have searched UFO sightings and military planes but nothing comes close to what I witnessed in shape and size for ones posted online are either a complete pointy triangle shape or skinny boomerang shape. I am posting it now because of another recent UFO sighting (not the same type unfortunately) has increased my interested in this phenomenon. I would love to discuss this with someone who has had the same sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.1139891304348;-121.633660869565
