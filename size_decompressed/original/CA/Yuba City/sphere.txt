3 orbs over Beale Air Force Base;2013-11-16 08:25:00;1 minute;3 orbs over Beale Air Force Base Heading south on route 70 out of Oroville we noticed 3 clear/white orbs floating over the road to our left.  They seemed to move independently of each other in random formations.  Pretty much blinked out of sight in a split second.  Looking at Google maps this appears to be above the direction of Beale Air Force Base. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
