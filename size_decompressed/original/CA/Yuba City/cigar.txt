Cigar/Cylinder shaped object seen over Yuba City, California;2010-10-25 09:00:00;2 minutes;Cigar/Cylinder shaped object seen over Yuba City, California Approximately at 9am I stepped outside to sit on my back porch when I noticed an object that was cigar shaped approaching from the North and heading south. I walked out into the yard to get a better look at it. I could immediately tell it wasn't an airplane. It lacked the usual appearance of the commercial airline planes I see periodically tail, wings, exhaust stream, markings of any kind, windows. It was a gleaming white yet translucent. Each end was rounded and the center was a different shade which made it look like it had a band around it. There was absolutely no sound coming from this craft.  The weather was calm no wind, blue skies, and a bright morning sun in the east. Since I had been uploading vacation photos from my camera into my laptop that was on the kitchen table, I had my camera in an accessible location. I ran into the house and grabbed the camera which took less than 10 seconds. Upon returning to the back yard, it was evident that this object was moving faster than any commercial airliner. I decided to put my camera on consecutive shooting but the craft was moving so fast and had changed it's course from a straight North to South path to an ascending southerly path and was gaining altitude with such speed that I was losing visual in a matter of seconds.  It went from a size where it would have taken a nickel to cover the entire craft to a pinpoint. I was only able to catch one pretty clear photo. Within just a few minutes of seeing this craft, I heard multiple helicopters in the area but never got a visual on them.
