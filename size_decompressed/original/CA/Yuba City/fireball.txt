While sitting in my duck blind on 10/29/98 I observed a large blue/silver sphere with a green halo streak horizontally across the sky followed by a wide exhaust trail, whitish in color. The event lasted 1.0 second and was gone. It moved as fast as a meteor. I was looking north and could see the white top of Mt. Shasta about 200 miles away. The object looked about the same size as the visible top of the mountain. It travelled from west to east and covered about a 20 deg. arc. The sky was clear with a few small clouds, no wind, bright sun, ambient temp. about 70 deg., and nothing interfered with full vision of the event. My eyesight is very good, corrected to 20/20.;39.1139891304348;-121.633660869565

But as I said even though there the same  its cool to watch them fall lol  2 other people seen them with me before and said they think they are metorors or space rock of some kind falling.........i dont know no mater  what i say peopel will belive what they want;39.1139891304348;-121.633660869565
