At f;2006-12-03 20:00:00;10 min;While walking my dog on the feather river levee at night, I noticed a floating light bar on the oppisite side (east) of the river.   At first I thought,  are they photographing something?  because the 6 or 8 flashing lights hanging down were so intense that it reminded me of flash bulbs used on camera's.  They were rectangle and flashing randomly at the rate of 5-10 per second with no pattern like aircraft.  As I watched it in the distance as it floated approx 1000 to 1500 ft. above ground, I noticed that the flight path was like an S pattern heading south.  And as I stared at it I thought that I could see it slipping from side to side and made the S pattern the craft was flying kind of jerk back and forth.  Then all of a sudden the light stopped for about 5 seconds and I could make out a dim white globe floating above where the center of the light bar would be.   The lights started up again and it floated away, not caring one bit as to who saw it.   The best way to describe what I saw, look at 10/28/06 ufo reports and find the one for Strawberry Ca.  It is 40 miles north of me and the hunter saw the same lights.;39.1139891304348;-121.633660869565
4 amber lights in formation moved slowly over me silently , seemed like either 2 objects or 1 big one.;2011-08-19 22:02:00;2 minutes;4 amber lights in formation moved slowly over me silently , seemed like either 2 objects or 1 big one. Driving N bound Hwy 99 just past Queens ave I noticed to the right 4 new radio towers with amber glowing lights.  They seemed to be very high radio towers and were stationary.  But towers in the area have red or white lights.  The lights then began to move slowly and together up a little then to the left.  2 amber lights (all 4 amber lights seemed to have a downward flare to them)in front about 100 feet apart and angled like this symbol \ were separated by about 350-400 feet from the trailing 2 amber lights which were angled more like this symbol / in a trapezoidal formation with the upper right light back some and the lower right light seeming closer assuming all the lights were equal in size, I would estimate each light to be about 1-2 feet in diameter and emitting a soft glow. I could not see anything between them and afterwards I realized there might not have been any stars between them either on a clear calm night with plenty of stars out.  I rolled the! window down and heard nothing other than road and wind noise since I was traveling about 60mph as it passed directly over head.  I thought it could be helicopters in formation until the lights moved so uniformly in paired formation that it seemed like it was either 2 objects (one on the left and one on the right) or one very large object.  The trailing 2 lights had about 150-200 feet between them. The trailing 2 lights adjusted a bit and the upper more to the rear light came forward about even top to bottom relative to me, with the bottom light seemingly not to change position at all while the first 2 lights on the left did not change relative position either as they moved across the horizon.  The 4 lights moved in equal rates of speed from the right of the highway over it to the left and continued in a westerly direction, one of the lights faded out, I believe the upper right and then glowed back on in a different position.  Then 2 went out and 1 came back on leaving 3 li! ghts then the 4th returned as it gained speed moderately.  It ! seemed l ike one large dark object with the tail portion rotating about 30 degrees around the lower axis.  As I continued down the road I lost sight of it and after 3 minutes I pulled over to see if it was still around but only saw 1 amber colored light flicker in amongst the stars and down low there were security lights and buildings obstructing lower level of view.  When I realized it was not helicopters I felt plenty eerie, and was greatly relieved when it continued onward.  I wonder why it was so low to the ground and stationary in a populated area and felt sorry for whoever was in that area at the time, it could have been an abduction or a return, orâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
