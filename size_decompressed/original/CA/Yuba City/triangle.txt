Three large lights in triangular formation spotted near Yuba City, CA on 11/30/02.;2002-11-30 17:45:00;2 minutes;Three large lights in triangular formation spotted near Yuba City, CA on 11/30/02. It was dark and overcast, at about 5:45pm on Saturday, November 30, 2002. I was driving north on a busy stretch of Highway 99, 5-10 miles south of Yuba City, CA. Roughly 1-2 miles ahead of me, I saw a very large white/yellow light hovering at about 1,000-2,000 feet in the air, approximately 100 yards off the highway. As I approached (about 1/2 mile away), I could see three large, distinct lights in a row, and one small red/orange blinking light on the left (west). I assumed the blinking light was a landing light on a wing, so I briefly dismissed it as a plane or jet. But the object continued to hover (as far as I could tell, it never moved), and as I began to pass underneath it, I realized that the three large lights were arranged in an equilateral triangle formation. I couldn't make out an outline of the object, because the three white/yellow lights were too bright. Unfortunately, there was too much traffic to find a place to safely pull over and observe the object. But there were 3-4 cars in front of me and 5-6 behind me, so I have to assume that someone else saw what I saw. I know that Beale AFB is roughly nearby, so who knows what it was. I suppose it could have been a Harrier jet, but as near as I could tell, it wasn't making any noise. I've seen hundreds of military and civilian aircraft in my life, and I've honestly never seen anything hover like that before. I am a senior at Chico State University in northern California, and to my knowledge, I am not insane.;39.1139891304348;-121.633660869565
3 Triangular objects, bright white lights with 2 round red tail lights, slow speed, low altitude;2005-03-08 21:00:00;5 minutes;3 Triangular objects, bright white lights with 2 round red tail lights, slow speed, low altitude 3 bright white lights forming the shape of an obtuse triangle, with approximately .25 mile between each object.  The top object and the one on the right slowly began heading south. the object on the right passed us first- we were on the balcony and it was south west of us, maybe 3 city blocks laterally away and .5 mile high, traveling at approximately 30mph.  At first we heard a faint noise-almost like a prop. plane- then that went away as the object neared us.  There were white lights that would at times combine with a blue and a red.  the object was white(or silver?), triangular in shape, but the bottom of the craft bowed down like the hull of a boat.  the back of the craft had two round red lights (like tail lights on a corvette!)  the size was approximately 18 ft. long and 14ft. wide.  The two crafts passed over identiticly ( about 3 minutes apart from each other) kept the same speed and then when almost out of sight, gained altitude and continued going south-east.  The 3rd craft (which would have made the left corner of the triangle)  then proceeded forward and went over EXACTLY as the others did;39.1139891304348;-121.633660869565
Black triangle with reddish lights.;2007-07-15 21:00:00;2 minutes;Black triangle with reddish lights. I had a strong argument with my (at that time) wife.  I went outside the house to the front yard and grabbed a plastic chair to sit on the driveway.  I sat down and looked at the stars by tilting my head back and resting it on the chair back support.  I kept hearing a buzzing sound (like a floresant light).  I tried to ignore it, but I was angry so I turned my head with annoyance to my right where the noise was coming from.  Thinking it was the street light to be at fault.  I saw hovering  above the light where the next neighbor lived a big black triangle craft.  It had three orange/reddish lights.  One at each corner.  It was just hovering like searching making that buzzing voice.  I got up from my chair really fast and went inside the house.  A minute later I went out to look, but it wasn't there.  I looked around to find it and saw three red lights on the sky by the butte mountains.  Then one flew fast like a comet then the second followed and finally the! last remaining. It seemed to dive down and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));39.1139891304348;-121.633660869565
