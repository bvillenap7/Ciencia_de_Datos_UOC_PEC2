5 ufo's very bright then turned dark and flew directly over us having no sound.;2013-01-03 20:35:00;5 minutes;5 ufo's very bright then turned dark and flew directly over us having no sound. 5 extremely bright lights rising into the air.  As they rose higher they would turn dark and begin flying directly towards us from our north to south.  We could see the shapes moving though the sky having no lights or sound.  I could not tell if they became almost clear or just darkened.   It was about 40 degrees out, light to no wind and very clear.  I did manage to get one picture that shows 4 lit objects.
