While en-route to work, I saw a very,very bright fireball, which changed colors-Bright red,to orange-yellow,to emerald green. It crossed the sky before my vehicle,while I was stopped at a red traffic light. It moved rapidly,but not as fast as say, a shooting star.  It made no changes in course, nor did it make any noise whatsoever. It was equal in brightness to a full moon.I also noted the object left a luminous trail,approx. four to five diameters of fireball while I watched it crossing the sky.;38.6614;-121.2636
