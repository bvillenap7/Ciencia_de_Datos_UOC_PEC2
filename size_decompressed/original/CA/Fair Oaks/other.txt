We were getting ready to cross the Sunrise Bridge over the American River when I noticed a low flying airplane, light blue in color, almost like the sky.  I pointed it out to my fiance but it was gone before he could catch a glimpse of it.  I was expecting a big crash due to how low it was flying but it was there, and then gone.  We looked in the sky all over for it.  I thought I was going crazy and then did a research online about sightings of the same thing.  I know I'm not insane.;38.6614;-121.2636
