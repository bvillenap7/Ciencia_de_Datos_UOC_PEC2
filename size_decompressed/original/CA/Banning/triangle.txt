My son and I saw two triangular craft hovering about 100 feet above the roadway.;1989-06-30 21:00:00;30 min.;My son and I saw two triangular craft hovering about 100 feet above the roadway. The two objects were hovering approximately 100 feet in the air and were absolutely silent.  We could see the entire shape was made up of rectangular pieces with something that looked like rivets holding them together.  There was a huge white light in the center and the light came straight down without diffusing outward.  The objects were black.  One of the objects was a little higher that the other but close.  I estimate the size to be about the size of three small fixed wing aircraft.  Although we were about one quarter of a mile from the Interstate 10 freeway right next to the Banning airport, all the ambient sounds dissapeared.  We were afraid to start our vehicle and sat there watching about one block away from the two objects.  All of a sudden both craft went upward, the lights on both craft went out and without a sound disappeared into the sky.  I was 42 years old and my son was 14 years old.  I had just picked him up from little league practice. I first noticed the light when I was backing out of my driveway to pick him up.  I lived about one and one quarter mile North of the airport at that time and noticed the light. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.9242;-116.8854
