Young woman on Hwy. I-10 watches bright light for 40 miles. Light turns slate gray, or black, changes shape. Suddenly disintegrates!;1996-06-09 05:00:00;35 min.;A young woman was driving eastbound on Highway I-10 near Banning and Idlewild, CA.  It was dark when she left home at 0400 hours, on 09JN96, and she had noted the moon in the eastern sky, so she knew what that celestial body looked like.  At 0500 hrs., she noticed a slice of light above a nearby mountain top.  It was bright, like a star.  She continued to watch the object for an estimated 35 minutes (approx. 40 miles), and the object appeared to stay in the same location.  She noted that whe was about the only vehicle on the highway, except for a truck that was behind her, approximately 2 miles. Then, the left side of the bright object blinked twice (she thought), and the whole object turned black, or perhaps gray.  However, the object remained stationary, and the core part of it appeared to the observer to be round.  She also added that the object looked like a sideways Vee.  (?)  The object remained stationary during this part of her sighting.  However, when the object was abreast of her, off to the left (?) side, it suddenly disintegrated and disappeared, like an etch-a-sketch.   She believes she witnessed a UFO as a teenager.;33.9242;-116.8854

From Banning looking S I saw a light that I first thought was a cabin in the mountains nearby. ((anonymous report));2017-10-28 19:00:00;5-10 minutes;From Banning, looking south, I saw a light that I first thought was a cabin in the mountains nearby. the light was still not moving.  A few seconds later I saw what appeared to be small lights circling below the light above.  This lasted for maybe 1 second.  then the grew less bright and seemed to move in a western direction.   I figured it was probably a plane but it was moving very slow.  At times not moving at all.  Then the light started changing colors, sometimes flashes of Red Lights sometimes white lights but it would be the whole light not a part of the light.  It stood still for a several minutes as the lights got dimmer and dimmer, until it was no longer visible to me.  The whole thing lasted between 10-12 minutes.
