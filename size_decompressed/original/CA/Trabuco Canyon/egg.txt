White Orbs 50-100 in front of Saddleback Mountain in Trabuco Canyon CA;2021-01-25 15:30:00;30 seconds;White Orbs 50-100 in front of Saddleback Mountain in Trabuco Canyon CA At 3:30 p.m. pacific time I set out to walk the dog. There was a winter storm system coming through the area causing very strong winds. The sky to the east had dark clouds. The sky to the west was clear and sunny. I was looking to the east to the top of the Saddleback Mountain ridge. In front of the dark clouds were these white orbs. At first I thought I was looking at a flock of sea gulls but then I realized they were too big to be birds because I was far away from the top of the mountain. Also I realized they weren’t really flying in a flock type of formation. They were kind of circling or swirling. They were definitely separated from one another and moving in synch with one another but they weren’t going horizontal. There were anywhere from 50 to 100 I think. I stood for a few more seconds trying to register what I was witnessing. I started to walk down the street toward the mountain hoping to get a better look and maybe film it. After another second or t! wo some started to disappear and re-appear. They kind of flickered in an out but not quickly. It was a slow flicker. Then almost all of them disappeared at once. Three to five were left and they formed a V shape for a second or two and then disappeared together.;33.6608;-117.592
