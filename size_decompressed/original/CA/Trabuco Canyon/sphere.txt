The light increased in intensity for about ten seconds.  At its brightest point, the light  appeared much larger then the relative size of a full moon (about 2-3 times larger in circumfrence).  The light was so intense that it  hurt  my eyes to look directly at it..  It stayed at full intensity for about 30 seconds and then suddenly turned off instantaneously like a light switch.  It still stayed slightly dim after the light stopped shining like  a hot light would after it is turned off.;33.6608;-117.592
