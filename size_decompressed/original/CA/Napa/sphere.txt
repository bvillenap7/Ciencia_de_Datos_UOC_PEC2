Two spheres or disks flying together over Solano County, Ca.;1969-08-03 14:00:00;3-4 minutes;Two spheres or disks flying together over Solano County, Ca. My friend and I were at a 4-H summer camp in the hills east of the city of Napa, California, in early August 1969.  It was mid-afternoon.  We had a broad view eastward into clear skies to very large  summer cumulus clouds rising over Solano and Yolo counties and the Sacramento Valley.   We watched  two large grey and beige disk or spherical objects fly across the sky from southeast to northwest.  They had no markings or lights and left no contrails.  Their color seemed to shift from beige or khaki to battleship grey when they neared and flew through the clouds.   They must've been very large, because they appeared to be about the size of my outstretched index fingernail from a distance of several miles and at an altitude about midway among the distant large cumulus clouds which they flew through.  They flew at a constant speed, in a tandem formation with the lower one slightly ahead.  They never varied their speed or direction.   I think they must've been travelling at around the speed of a commerical jet airliner because they covered the distance from southeast of Vacaville in Solano County to near Mt. St. Helena in Lake County in around three minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.4026875;-122.264765625
Observed a bronze or amberish orb 1000 ft. up hovering over a residential area for appx 3 mins and then it moved away.;2000-09-29 01:20:00;5 Minutes;Observed a bronze or amberish orb 1000 ft. up hovering over a residential area for appx 3 mins and then it moved away. I was driving home, and saw a bronze or amber orb stationary about 1000 ft up.  The object was between Queen of the Valley Hospital and Salvador Ave, just east of North Jefferson St.  At first I thought it was a planet.  I stopped at a stop sign and observed it hovering for about 3 minutes and the light simply faded out.  It was directly over a residential area.  It reappeared a little ways off from where I originally saw it.  Then it started to move and faded away as it moved north west.  There was no sound.;38.4026875;-122.264765625
UFO's over Napa, Ca. sky.;2002-06-29 10:50:00;40 seconds;UFO's over Napa, Ca. sky. I saw three? orbs silver in color apparently reflecting sunlight moving swiftly accross the sky. The first was not as bright but the second and third ones were very bright but small. They appeared to be very high in the atmosphere and changed directions very quickly. I did not see all three orbs at the same time, it may have been one Orb cris crossing.;38.4026875;-122.264765625
Small hovering bright light seen in the evening sky.;2010-06-20 18:40:00;5 min.;Small hovering bright light seen in the evening sky. The sphere was seen to hover at 90ยบ in the sky and did not move during observation.  It was at a very high altitude above the clouds. It pulsated slightly and was very bright and small.  The color of the light was white and the pulsations where the same.;38.4026875;-122.264765625
Yellow/Orange glowing sphere sighted by 4 people over Napa CA;2013-06-08 20:25:00;1:00;Yellow/Orange glowing sphere sighted by 4 people over Napa CA We were outside wondering what to do because a tree just fell on my car.  We were standing in the driveway and all of a sudden we saw this sphere that looked like it was on fire or glowing and traveling low to the ground.  It was heading east.  We lost view when it traveled behind trees.  We have a video of the second one!;38.4026875;-122.264765625
Large reddish orange light that dropped many more lights out of it, and some smaller same colored lights shot out the top.;2017-04-23 00:50:00;1 minute;Large reddish orange light that dropped many more lights out of it, and some smaller same colored lights shot out the top. I do star parties for hire with a large telescope I designed and built.   At 12:50 a.m., I was going east on Trancas Street in Napa, CA, heading home from a star party.  I observed a large orange/red circular light over about the area of the Queen of the Valley Hospital, about a quarter mile away from my position, moving slowly north to south, maybe 500-750 feet high (it looked lower than an airplane at pattern altitude).  The diameter of the circular light I observed I'd say was on the order of about the diameter of the length of a small airplane viewed at that distance, perhaps a bit smaller, so while very subjective, perhaps in the range of 20' diameter. As I watched it slowly moving, it dropped a large light out of it!  It fell straight down!  And then it dropped another and another and then a whole string of maybe 6 or more!  And more smaller lights shot out the top of the thing going up!   I did get some pictures but of course they're not great.   The lights were BRIGHT, and a dark reddish orange in color. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I have enough doubt now that I should rescind my report I made yesterday re. Napa, CA.  I think it was a tribute balloon on fire a lot closer to me than I thought.;38.4026875;-122.264765625
