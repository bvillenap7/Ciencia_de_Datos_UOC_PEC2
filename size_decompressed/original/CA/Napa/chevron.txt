Rest of object was cloaked (invisible) I was driving in a residential neighborhood, going north, alone in my car when I looked east and saw a V-shaped object, bigger than a football field, with red-orange flames on its edges forming a flaming V.  There were no other external features, so if it was a stealth plane, then it was cloaked in invisibility.  As soon as I saw the object it began moving from SE to NW at impossible speed. It went from east to west within 2 seconds, starting at an altitude about a half mile and crashing into the earth on the west side of town. I was sure it crashed near Denny's on Solano Ave. It made absoutely no sound. I have been observing UFOs since 1966 and have seen several, one 20-30 feet above me. That's another story.;38.4026875;-122.264765625
Dark chevron shape zooming across the night sky with no lights on it.;2003-01-15 19:30:00;6 seconds;Dark chevron shape zooming across the night sky with no lights on it. My fiance and I were walking through the neighborhood one clear winter evening, when My fiance looked up and stopped very fast and told me to look up.  I looked up and she pointed to this very fast moving dark object moving North.  We could just barely see that it was chevron in shape, maybe 2 or 3,ooo feet up.  It had a barely discernable faint glow on the back of it, but seemed shiny with no lights on it at all.  It was moving steadily at maybe 5oo mph, if my guess on its' altitude is correct.  We watched it until it's shape seemed to blend into the night sky.  It made absolutely no noise.  My first thought was that it could be a stealth bomber, but if it was, it would have aircraft lights on it, required by the FAA.  This object was almost completely blacked out.  This object also was chevron or boomberang shaped and was seen directly overhead.  A stealth bomber is more triangular shaped when viewed from above or below.  This object made no noise.  A stealth bomber still makes a little noise at minimal throttle and when the air is cold, sound travels further.  It was cold that evening.  We were very lucky we even spotted it.  It was camouflaged so well with the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of five interesting reports from same witness.  PD));38.4026875;-122.264765625
