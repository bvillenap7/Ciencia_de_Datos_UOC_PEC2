Object appeared to be rectangular in shape with fire under it, it seemed just above the the rooftop then rose to the altitude of an aircraft or higher at which time it changed shape and appeared circular and on fire, either emmiting light, orange and yellow light like fire, it moved very quickly northward, still at high altitude, it must have been very large as it was visible for quite some time. I have never seen anything like it.;38.4026875;-122.264765625
Orange glowing glob of light shifting shapes like a lava lamp one night while driving.;2003-01-23 23:15:00;3 seconds;Orange glowing glob of light shifting shapes like a lava lamp one night while driving. This was an extremely bizzarre sighting.  And ironically happened just days after another sighting I had.  I was driving to my fiance's place after getting off work one night and was driving North on Jefferson St. approaching the Lincoln Ave. intersection, when this weird sight, off to the left and up a little, caught my attention.  It was an orange glowing mass a few miles away that was shifting shapes.  Smaller masses would break off and re-join the glob of light.  It was like watching the wax in a lava lamp do it's thing in fast forward.  As soon as I got a good look at it it faded away. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of five interesting reports from same witness.  PD));38.4026875;-122.264765625
