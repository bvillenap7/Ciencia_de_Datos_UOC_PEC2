At first it appeared to be holding still, after 5-10 minutes, it moved very fast in a northerly direction, and, then moved from one point to another, slowly, then very fast again.  At this time, it is still moving about in the same portion of the sky.  This same object has been seen for over a two months period (from September to December 12, 2003, by two of the witnesses that is presently making this report.  We called the Coast Guard, the weather station and  finally the UFO hotline to report what we have been seeing for the last 4 months and were told it must have been a star and, we just thought it moved.  The object we are now seeing in the western sky, appears to be the same as what we have been seeing, only then it was it the south-east portion of the sky, and moving about just as it is this pm in the western portion of sky.  I looked for it for the last two nights and could not see it.  We then saw the same object in the Western sky, as stated on this report.  We do not do drugs and have not had anything to drink (yet) and of a clear mind and of average to upper average intelligence.We have NEVER seen anything like this before and we are certain, without a shadow of doubt as to the accuracy of our statement.  The object appears to have bluish green lights underneath or across it and they appear to be flashing.  In my observing this object from September to December 12, 2003, I would spend two to three hours just watching it move about.  Two of the witnesses are practicing attorneys and were apprehensive in even attempting to report our sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that Venus is in the western sky at the time indicated by the witness.  PD));38.4026875;-122.264765625
Flashing light in the sky outside my bedroom window.  Circular in shape & lights falshed as it spun.;2010-12-30 06:30:00;4 minutes;Flashing light in the sky outside my bedroom window.  Circular in shape & lights falshed as it spun. This morning at about 6:30am I saw a flashing light in the sky outside my bedroom window.  I realized quickly that it was not a plane because of its erratic and slow movement.  It went up a little then to the right a little & stayed with this pattern for about 4 minutes until it was out of view.  It was circular in shape & the lights flashed as the UFO circled (spun).  It could not have been a helicopter because of the way it moved, slowly but surely. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD));38.4026875;-122.264765625

Large round object with orange light.;2015-05-18 21:15:00;5 minutes;Large round object with orange light. I went outside and saw a huge orange crescent shape object in the sky.  It was north west just above the hills that have grapes planted on them.   I got my binoculars to see it better and could see that the crescent shape was diminishing.  As the light was almost gone, I could see the shape of the object in the dark.  It was like a huge ball and  three times bigger than a full moon.  It faintly glowed.   Then when the crescent light faded the object disappeared.;38.4026875;-122.264765625
