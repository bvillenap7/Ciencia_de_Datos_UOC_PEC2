I witnessed a large bright ball of orange red that was traveling in a left to right fashion. It was in the Northern direction about 40 degrees of horizon, and traveling at a slow pace compared to meteors I've witnessed.  Twice I saw small embers fall off the ball and head downward towards earth, and the whole time period might have been between 30 to 60 seconds.  It finally disappeared totally above the horizon line from my view.  Have any ideas about what I saw?  One of my old teachers said it wasn't a satellite due to wrong aerial positioning, and didn't sound like a launch of some kind.  Thanks....gary wong,napa,ca.;38.4026875;-122.264765625
Falling fireball ended in lightning-like flash to north of Napa, CA 10/30/2005 19:30 PST;2005-10-30 19:30:00;momentary;Falling fireball ended in lightning-like flash to north of Napa, CA 10/30/2005 19:30 PST While traveling north on CA SR29 near the Napa County Airport we observed a rapidly falling fireball dropping behind a small (200' elevation) hill to our north.  Scale and distance are hard to guess, but we thought it might be on the order of 25-30 miles distant.  Much farther than that and the scale of the object would have been rather immense.   Our location at the time of sighting was approximately  38°13'59.74N by 122°15'34.61W, elevation about 88 feet ASL.  Skies were pretty much clear all around.   The odd thing about it was that as the fireball disappeared over the horizon there was a tremendous flash of light, very much like lightning in the color of the light and how it lit the sky and backlit the hill between it and us.  It was almost a disappointment that we did not hear a corresponding kaBOOM. ((NUFORC Note:  We received several other reports from California about this incident.  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally good witness, and exceptionally credible.  PD));38.4026875;-122.264765625
Fireball across the  napa sky around 9pm, looked like an airliner on fire but afdter checking nothing reported;2006-09-16 09:00:00;3-5 Min;Fireball across the  napa sky around 9pm, looked like an airliner on fire but afdter checking nothing reported It was Saturday night almost 9p.m. My family and I decided, a lil too late in the evening, to do a backyard B.B.Q. My spouse, with a tad bit more patience than I this evening, refocused their lil minds by cleverly pointing out several lights in the sky. IMMEDIATELY as we look into the sky, our focus is immiediatly frozen to a very unfamiliar sight in the sky. There was some type of formation, whether it be a Star,Rock or a UFO, I am still not sure but whatever the object it did have a capitivating glow around it, possibly an aircraft in distress we originally assumed until we drove out to the county airport (with the same kids that were driving us crazy shortly before, and to add to the delima our eldest child, 4 years in age, saw the entire showing in the sky, and came to belive that it was a airplane full of people who caught fire shortly before crashing) My son has abbrivated leters after his name that would make a doctor jealous, but these letters identify his special needs emotionally, he is a very smart and has a imignation with no limits...he asked questions the entire drive to the local airport (30 min) he has told us we need flashlights and paints a childlike graphic image of what he expects to encounter once on the scene. Needless to say we encountered nothing but the same intoxicated, out of state winos. We drove until his nerves were at ease and he was sure that there wasnt a plane on fire. He then fell asleep as his younger brother had shortly before. When we got home and pulled the sleepy kids from the van he told his mom that it wasnt a plane crash that he had belived it to be, that it actually was a shooting-star. The rest of the night into the morning we still felt like the only people who had seen this as there was no news reports and it wasnt until this sunday morning I did a google search for any information and came up with only 1 article, reported by a girl in the TARGET parking lot.  There might have been 2 of these things or part of it burned and fell from the main object, I am still not sure  We are still VERY interested in finding out more about this, from others who witnessed it or anyone who may know more.
