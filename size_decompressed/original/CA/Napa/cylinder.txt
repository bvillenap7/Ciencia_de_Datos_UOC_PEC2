Cylinder shaped craft with conicle nose and whiteish with no wings visible and no contrail or sound ,traveling mach 1- 2.;2014-04-05 12:09:00;6 seconds;cylinder shaped craft with conicle nose and whiteish with no wings visible and no contrail or sound, traveling mach 1- 2 at 12:09 pm in napa at austin park off of dry creek rd.  i heard  two hawks making noise in the sky and when i looked up in a north west direction to look at the hawks and then as i watched them fly in direction towards north santa rosa, if you were loking at a watch dial with west being 12.00o'clock the craft was in a three o'clock position moving faster then any plane or jet i ever seen and without a even a contrail to follow it, it had no wings and was cylinder shaped with conicle nose and traveling in upper statoshere and took about two to three seconds to travel out of site.   then  as i looked to my left there were 4 planes traveling same direction but coming from a southern west direction like coming from travis air force base and they all were flying one after another and they all left a contrail and sound at first i thought in might  be a drone but it had no wings and was traveling at least mach 2 but with no punch sound from breaking the sound barrier. then i thought missile but then no vapor trail or sound, and no news or info on internet for craft or rocket launch in area and their are no bases in direction of craft.;38.4026875;-122.264765625
