It was a dark gray metalic color and no lights that I can recall.  It had large windows down the side to me it resembled the shape of an uncooked hotdog.  we watched it for approxamatley 5 or 6 minutes, untill it was to far off to see anymore.It never changed course and never changed altitude.;38.4026875;-122.264765625
White wingless object seen flying above Napa California;2002-02-09 15:30:00;15 seconds;White wingless object seen flying above Napa California It was a warm and cloudless day. The driver's side window was down while we were heading west through Napa.  A beautiful foothill was directly ahead of the city road we were traveling on.  I was thinking that the foothill was georgeous while trying to keep my eyes on the road.  Then I saw it! Hey, what is that in the sky?  It is straight ahead, noiseless, all white, and oh my, it does not have any wings.  My passenger is an amateur photog and never leaves home without his camera so of course, he started snapping photos of the object.  We were both puzzled.  No sound was coming through my open window, it had no wings, tail, window, no markings at all.  It looked like a cigar with rounded ends.  Actually, it had no end as the front and back were identical.  It was traveling to the right of my car, below the horizon of the foothill, in a steady direction. Noiselessy, effortlessly, smoothly. To me, it appeared to be traveling slowly.  My passenger felt it to be traveling rapidly.  From the first sighting to the end, we estimated the time of viewing to be about 15 seconds.  After looking at a map of the area it appears that it traveled 3 or 4 miles in this time span. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded both sincere, and convincing.
