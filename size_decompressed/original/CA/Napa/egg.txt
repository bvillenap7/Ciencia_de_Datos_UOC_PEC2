Saw a white, egg-shaped object shoot across the sky like a meteor, but there was no tail or vapor trail of any kind.  No sonic boom either.  It was travelling east of Napa on a south to north trajectory.  About 2 seconds behind it another identical craft going the same speed on the same trajectory flew past.  Essentially I believe I witnessed a formation of aircraft flying at hypersonic speed and their flight path would carry them pretty close to Travis AFB.;38.4026875;-122.264765625
