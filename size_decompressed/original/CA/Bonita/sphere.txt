It got even better when i stepped out of my car in the jack in the box line to make sure what i was seeing was real.  These three orb's then proceeded to put on some kind of display of slow but fast like zig S's.  Then the orange orb's when off one by one and back on after they each made a few S's in the sky ( they had a very beautiful streak behind them, like a comet tail).  After that they came back on and proceeded to follow each other toward the the ocean slow but smooth, they descended behind the trees in the distance at Glen Abby Mortuary and i couldn't see them after that.  It was quite an amazing display what ever it was, it made the hair on my neck stand up!;32.6657;-117.0272
