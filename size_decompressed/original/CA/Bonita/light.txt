Three bright red lights witnessed floating stationary over San Diego New Years Day 2010;2010-01-01 00:00:00;13 minutes;Three bright red lights witnessed floating stationary over San Diego New Years Day 2010 At 12:00 am, jan 01, 2010 I went out to listen to the firecrackers for the New Years celebrating going on, and I immediately saw three bright red lights in the sky to the northeast of my location. At first they were in a triangular position, then they moved into a straight line, somewhat horizontal to the earth. I went inside to call a friend or two and when I returned outside one of the lights was gone. The other two lights started to flicker and die out, then one died. The last light remained for a couple minutes more, then it too died out.  Other than coming into alignment with each other, the lights did not move at all. They were stationary in the sky with a very bright glowing red color.;32.6657;-117.0272
I noticed there was a single very bright like star but closer.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star, but cannot be sure.

It is blinking colors such as red, white, blue, etc.  It's also moving in an indistinct pattern.  There aren't any clouds in the sky either so it's pretty visible to the naked eye.  I asked my husband if he can see it clearly and he also says it's moving in a weird pattern. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star, but cannot be sure. PD));32.6657;-117.0272
