Tear drop comet looking objects in the sky;2010-05-25 21:48:00;Few Seconds;Tear drop comet looking objects in the sky I and my girlfriend were going too hung out with our friends at the place called Living room.  As we parked our car and got off I spotted in the distance two star looking lights close to each other.  I stopped and started observing them.  The objects looked like a lights on the passenger plane wings.  Bright yellow color.  Close together.   Within few seconds me and my girlfriend are noticed that those lights slowly started what looked to us falling down.  They changed shape and looked like a comet with the fire trail.   As the tear drop objects were falling they were separating from each other further and further.  All of the sudden one of them stopped and than they both disappear in the sky.  As from the angle it looked like they could be well observed somewhere around otay or san yasindro border.  Or maybe even chula vista.   Both I and my girlfriend witness the event.
