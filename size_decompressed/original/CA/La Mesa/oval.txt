Red/Amber Orb falling from the sky.;1993-09-09 21:00:00;5 minutes;Red/Amber Orb falling from the sky. At 8:00 in the evening, around September 9th, 1993, my younger brother and I witnessed a red/amber orb.  I was driving my car, and I saw this orb falling very fast out of the sky.  The only object I ever saw falling that fast was a falling star. Then, in the middle of its fall, it performed about 3-5 horizontal figure eights, and continued its fall-down.  I continued to follow it up a hill towards my home.  I lost it for about a mile (many trees lined the road).   When I came to the top of the hill, the object was a few hundred feet ahead of us, and hovering above the stoplight.   After hovering for a few seconds, it took off towards the West at tremendous speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
