Bright reddish star in La Mesa;1996-09-15 05:00:00;30 seconds;Bright reddish star in La Mesa This occured as me and my boss were entering work, early in the morning. We stopped and looked at an unusally bright red star in the sky. We commented on it and looked at it for about 10 seconds when we noticed a smaller reddish star looking object appeared to be dropping straight down, very slowly, from the original object. It looked as if it was released from the original star like object. A few seconds after that started happening we hurried into the office. So I do not know what happened next. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
2 steady red lights observe fireworks on the 4th of July over LaMesa/El Cajone area San Diego County Calif.;2004-07-04 21:00:00;5 to 10 minutes;2 steady red lights observe fireworks on the 4th of July over LaMesa/El Cajone area San Diego County Calif. While watching the fireworks on the 4th of July. I watched 2 steady red lights about the size of the stars already up in the sky. The red lights were moving together but the second one was closing space on the first one. When they got directly overhead the spot where the fireworks were being displayed they stopped. They were about if I hold my arm out I could put my thumb out and that was about the spce in between them. The red lights were a steady red light that's what caught my attention. Then when they were stationary they would blink occasionally like they were talking to each other during the fireworks show. Then after about 5 or maybe even ten minutes first one went out then a few moments then the other. I know it wasn't a helocopter because the height that they were at, plus the steady red light.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
Streaking lights over San Diego.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a laser-based advertising light???  PD));2006-10-13 17:30:00;5-10 min;Streaking lights over San Diego I was sitting in my house in La Mesa (San Diego) when my room mate called me hysterical. He said to look out front. I went outside to see 4 very bright lights to the east. They appeared to be quite some distance away but were as bright as the street lights that were just coming on. 2 of them sat perfectly still while the other 2 darted in and out of some low clouds. The 2 lights appeared to be from the same craft.  After a few trips into the clouds, the lights stopped perfectly still. The other 2 lights then took off in a zig zagging pattern. The light streaked behind following the movement pattern. Eventually, all the lights disappeared. The speed of the movement was amazing. During all of this, two of my room mates came home and my neighbors were watching. Everyone saw the same thing. There was an Air Show in San Diego that weekend, but it was to the north west of my house. I attended the air show and nothing there made any movements even remotely similar to what we saw the day before. I am also a lighting technician and I know of nothing that can cause light to streak behind like that except for extremely high speeds. No aircraft can accelerate to that speed from a stand still in that short a distance. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a laser-based advertising light???  PD));32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
4 Red Lights over La Mesa/El Cajon;2009-07-04 20:50:00;Approx 20 Min;4 Red Lights over La Mesa/El Cajon I generally don’t post things, but this I just had to. On July 4th 2009, at about 8:50 PM, I looked to the SE part of the sky.  We live in north La Mesa and can see the cross from Mount Helix from our back yard. The lights looked to be just east of there. We have had other “sightings” before (3 years in a row except for last year), so this would be our 4th year. With the naked eye they look like red lights. They generally seemed to appear right as the fireworks started.  But this time as I looked up, I saw 4 red lights in a large triangular pattern and yelled to my husband “They are here now!”  I grabbed my camera (with tripod) and got some unique photos. With magnification, the red dots appear to look like some sort of worm like shape. And they moved faster than the shutter.  Then 2 of the lights just “faded out”.  I took as many as I could. By 9:10: they were all gone.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
Three red lights over southern California that made a triangle shape;2010-01-01 00:00:00;10 min;Three red lights over southern California that made a triangle shape My wife and I saw three red lights in the sky looking towards the west from our house in La Mesa California.  The lights made a triangle shape and were moving across the sky.  As if they were moving south.  The front one broke off and proceeded to move away form the other two. Then the one that broke off just vanished.  The other two were there for a few more minutes then disappeared as well. The total time that I had witnessed the lights in the sky over Southern California was about 10 minutes.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
A moving star-like object changed direction and blinked out;2012-04-10 19:50:00;3 minutes;A moving star-like object changed direction and blinked out I was out on my back porch and looking at the stars (as I always do) and I noticed a particularly bright one and it was moving.  At first thinking that maybe it was a satellite, albeit bright, I was about to go in when the “star” made a sudden left turn.  The satellite theory went out the window for me and I ran into my house to grab my camera.  Since the star had changed paths, I went out the front door knowing I would meet it coming over the roof.  I turned on my camera to video mode, but as I had to zoom in all the way to make it appear on my end, I soon realized as it continued to move away that there was nothing special about the video I was taking – meaning there was no backdrop that would prove its movement, etc.  Through the lens it just looked like a bright star.  Frustrated, I turned off my camera and watched as the “star” moved further away.  Then, just as quick as it had appeared, it was gone.  It was like some switch had been flicked – the “star” just blinked out.  It literally just turned off its bright light.  Now I wished I had filmed it.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
Large star-like object moved up and away in the south-east sky;2012-10-30 19:00:00;3 minutes;Large star-like object moved up and away in the south-east sky At around 7pm I took my dogs out to the back.  It was early and not fully dark yet.  The stars in the sky were just becoming visible.  I looked up and noticed a bright, huge star.  I was moving in a south-east direction.  I hollered for my husband, but before he got outside the object moved up and away quickly and vanished.  It was like nothing I had seen before.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
