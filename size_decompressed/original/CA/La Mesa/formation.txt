Lights formed an equilateral triangle and then shifted sideways I live in La Mesa, CA ( East county suburb of  San Diego) I awoke at 1:20 am last night (2-24-09) after hearing a thump.  When I looked out the window to the east, I saw three bright red lights in the sky.  They appeared to be stationary  They created an equilateral triangle.  I awakened my husband. As we watched the lights they shifted sideways, losing the equilateral shape. He went to awaken our son. As the three of us continued watching the three lights continued to shift.  Then they became dimmer. Two disappeared with the third disappearing a few seconds later.  About 8 minutes lapsed from the time I first saw the lights until they disappeared.. I also saw a similar single bright red light in the same eastern sky on New Yearâ€™s Eve (1/31/08).  My Mom and Neighbor also saw this.  This light appeared closer than last nights lights. At first we thought it was a flare, however it never dropped. It was a bit more North (left) in the sky as it hovered.  After a few minutes, it shifted to the right (south) after several minutes it shifted even more to the right.  We never saw it move.  The next thing we knew it had disappeared.  I would say that about 12-15 minutes lapsed from the first time we saw it until it disappeared.   My 16 year old son was at a home in Fletcher Hills, a part of El Cajon (the town just north of La Mesa).  He and his friends also saw the same light.  He said that it appeared to the south of his location.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
Unidentified lights fly in and out of formation high in the night sky over east San Diego.;2014-01-01 03:00:00;15 minutes;Unidentified lights fly in and out of formation high in the night sky over east San Diego I was in the jacuzzi looking up at stars as I do often. I noticed approximately 6 or more very bright lights in a row moving from north to south. The lights were very high in the sky, at the level of the highest stars I could see. They all blinked separately, yet in close intervals. At one point, one of the lights broke away from the line and traveled back in a northern direction.  It quickly shot back into the line yet followed behind the line a bit. I ran down our stairs to the back door to call my wife and daughter.  They quickly came outside and saw what I described above.  The line of lights had moved quite a bit south by now.  As my wife looked closely (her eyes are better than mine), she noticed more than 6 lights.  She said she could see faint lights in an oval or triangular shape behind the brighter lights.  She and my daughter saw the lights moving at a slow pace. The row of lights often changed formation, but ended back in a row eventually. My daughter tried to video the lights with her iphone, but they were too high to film.  We did shoot for a while and you can hear our audio. After the lights disappeared in the southern sky, we all confirmed with each other that we had never seen anything like this.  And, we believe it was a UFO. At one point we thought it might be the international space station, but the lights moved.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
