They were coming from behind a tree in my front yard, they were in no order at all, they came from the north, to the west, as I was looking due west toward the ocean.  They hovered and then moved away from each other, then back in formation again, with I amazing speeds, then just faded out one at a time. I had not had a drink at all!!   I then ran into the house and got my video recorder and shot about 1-2 mins. of video.  As I zoomed up with a very power full zoom lens, they looked like the ones that were flying over Arizona back in the 90’s.  They were spinning like a basket ball would be if you had it spinning on your finger, when I zoomed up close. I did take a 1.30 minute video if you want a copy. I am 58 years old, and live in San Diego Ca. I just heard you from 1/12/2012 on stream link now.  That’s why it has taken so long to write you . I hope you get this.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
Orange fireball dropping a flare;2020-01-18 21:00:00;5 minutes;Orange fireball dropping a flare Glowing orange, circular light was spotted around 21:00 rising from NNE. Remained stationary for several minutes before seemingly dropping an orange flare.  Began to drop towards the horizon for approximately a minute while glowing off and on before vanishing. Afterwards briefly re-appearing at the original position.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826

I watched it for about 3 to 5 seconds then ran to get my husband and told him to come outside. It was still slowly moving across the sky. When he came back out I ran in and grabbed my phone it came out and took a couple pictures and then took a video. Right at the four-second mark it vanished. I saw it traveling across the sky oh, it was under 35000 feet because then I saw a plane at 2 o'clock from it but the airplane was much higher than this object so I know the object was under 35000 feet.  As I'm watching this orange ball of light slowly move across the sky from west to east,  I then saw it to ascend up towards deep space and away from Earth.  It was moving from west to east as I was facing north.  I then saw it slowly ascend back towards space and then it vani! shed.  I saw it so well with the naked eye.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
