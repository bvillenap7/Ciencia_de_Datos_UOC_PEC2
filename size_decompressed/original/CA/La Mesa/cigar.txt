Massive, Cigar-Shaped White Light Hovering;2017-12-15 06:45:00;1 minute;Massive, Cigar-Shaped White Light Hovering I was driving to work today, when I saw a massive, cigar-shaped bright-white light hovering over East County San Diego.  I was driving east on Interstate 8, when I saw it.  There was not a single cloud in the sky, due to the high pressure that has been present in San Diego. I lost it as I was driving through Mission Valley, because the Southern Mesas were blocking it out.  When I drove out of the valley at reached the top of Montezuma Mesa, it completely vanished from the sky without a trace.  I estimate that it was at least a 1/2 mile across in length. I saw this same object on October 26th, 2017, from my balcony, moving over the Pacific Ocean.  I reported that sighting along with pictures of it earlier.  I also have 2 short videos of it, too.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
