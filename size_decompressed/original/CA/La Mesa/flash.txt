Fast moving object blue white light nighttime only visible for a second.;2014-09-11 21:12:00;1 second;Fast moving object blue white light nighttime only visible for a second. I was out on my balcony, smoking a cigarette, when I saw a flash of blue-white light which was traveling from east to west quickly pass overhead.  I saw it for only a second, or possibly even less. It couldn't have been more than a few thousand feet overhead, but it was hard to tell due to the fact that it was only visible for approximately a second. As far as I could tell, it was a single object. I have no idea as to the shape of it, since I only witnessed a flash of blue-white light. There was no sound.  And I quickly stood up to try to get a better view.  By that point it was gone. I've lived in this area for about a year and a half, and I'm quite used to the normal police helicopters, border patrol helicopters, commercial airline planes, and private planes that move around the skies in this area as well as the sounds they produce. This was like nothing I have ever seen before, and the fact that it produced no sound is what really made the hair on the back of my neck prick up.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
