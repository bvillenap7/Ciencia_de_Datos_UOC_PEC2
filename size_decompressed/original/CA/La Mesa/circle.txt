Bright red light in the night sky.Sometime later separate fluorescent white light falls from the sky to the ground.;2001-01-05 21:45:00;5-8 min.;Bright red light in the night sky.Sometime later separate fluorescent white light falls from the sky to the ground. I was sitting on my terrace when I saw a bright red light in the sky.At first I thought it was an aeroplane but I noticed that it didn't have any other color lights nor did it seem to move.I have no idea how high it was but judging  by the planes that were on their way to land at San Diego's airport my guess is a couple of thousand meters.I told my husband to come outside and look at the red light,he thought it might be a balloon(the flame that is) but it didn't look like fire to me.Then it just died down and I couldn't see it anymore.We went inside and about 20 min.later my husband said wow something just fell out of the sky...at first I thought he was pulling my leg, but he wasn't.He said he saw a huge white fluorescent light fall from the sky behind some trees that are on the adjacent property.I don't know if the two incidents are related or what the were? but I thought I'd report them anyway.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826

Saw a red cluster or fire ball hovering in the eastern sky. It blinked on and off and suddenly went out.;2003-12-31 23:50:00;15 minutes;Saw a red cluster or fire ball hovering in the eastern sky. It blinked on and off and suddenly went out. We saw a red cluster hovering in the eastern sky.  It appeared solid and was blinking on and off.  It did not move.  Ironically, we saw the exact same light exactly two years earlier on new years eve 2002( we were sober I might add).  It hovered for approximately 15 minutes and then the light went out. It was to high to be a plane and no way was it a helicopter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
Bright cingular light above San diego that has no sound, has very jerky movement, and is at a extremely high altitude.;2009-08-24 00:30:00;30 minutes+;Bright cingular light above San diego that has no sound, has very jerky movement, and is at a extremely high altitude. Me and my family spotted a glowing sphere of some sort about 80 degrees in the sky. The Sphere is a very bright white and appears to be hovering in place. It is brighter than any star or any planet around us by at least 10 times. The object appears to be moving in a small triangular shape with very jerky movements. We watched it for approximately 14 minutes before the light completely shut off. About 3 minutes later it was there again seemingly to appear out of nowhere, as if the lights just got turned back on. There is no sound and it looks to be at a very high altitude, much too high to be a firework, airplane, or helicopter of some sort. This light has also been seen on 08/04/2009 at 0:22 (12:22 am), about the same time as this one started. Both events were exactly the same, but the one on 08/04/2009 was to the far east and appeared to be over the Alpine area.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
Missing man V-formation.;2014-03-21 20:00:00;4 seconds;Missing man V formation While stepping out in my back yard for a smoke, I always look up into the night sky, usually say my hellos to Orion this time of year, then I suddenly saw a movement to the side of me.  It was a 3-1 V formation, one lead, 2 on one side and 1 on other side, moving North-Northeast.   At first sight thought odd flock of birds, then instantly realized they were not birds.  Moving much faster then birds though at what appeared to be same altitude as birds would fly.  Size not overly large, which gave first thought to being birds.   Quickly surmised sighting, four oval/disk shapes, moving way to fast to be birds, silent, no deviation from orientation to each other, no motion other than a straight trajectory, perfect flawless formation and consistent speed.   Light enough whitish hue to be seen but not bright, almost a stealth kind of look.  As they passed over the house I moved to continue watching them but I could no longer see them.  With a head movement from left shoulder to right shoulder the whole event lasted no more than 4 seconds.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
Me and my son saw this huge white light come out of the sky to ground or pacific ocean very strange this was no metor!;2014-04-23 00:57:00;10-15 seconds;Me and my son saw this huge white light come out of the sky to ground or pacific ocean very strange this was no meteor! Driving westbound back from 7-11 store.  Seen very large circle shape white light coming down from direct above space toward ground at a very high rate of speed.   The circle was larger then any jet aircraft and had no tail or trail of light.  Estimate headed out in pacific ocean.   Called in to police to report. both of us saw this and we went to top of hill to see if we could see impact but did not see anything else.;32.7771927536232;-117.018504347826
