Orange light, oval in shape.;2011-12-04 03:05:00;10;Orange light, oval in shape. Driving south-bound on 805 freeway, we saw an oval-shaped, orange colored lighted object standing stationary over the 16 street bridge/overpass.  It hovered about 250 feet above the bridge. It was difficult to listen for any sound it may have emitted.  We took the next exit ramp to get back north-bound on the 805 to try and film it, but the phone camera wasn't equipped to handle the distance and low light.  As we got closer to the bridge where it hovered, it began to ascend straight up (perpendicular to the bridge) and then it stopped to change direction to ~45 degrees up, and westwardly. It turned from an orange glow to a bright red the farther it went.  Then it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
