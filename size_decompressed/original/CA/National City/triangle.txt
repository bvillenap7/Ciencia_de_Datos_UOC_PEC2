It was hovering and so close to the ground that I felt as though I could shake hands with the pilot.  It took off north at amazing speed.   Later I realized it reminded me of the scene in close encounters of the third kind, where the ship was directly overhead, expect for the shape and the many lights.;32.6751380952381;-117.09309047619
I am resending this as I did not state that the triangle was only about 100 feet overhead and that this event happened on Palm Ave.  On;2014-12-10 18:45:00;~1 minute;I am resending this as I did not state that the triangle was only about 100 feet overhead and that this event happened on Palm Ave.   One 9/14/15 someone was on Palm Ave about one mile west and saw the triangle.   Please add Palm Avenue to my sighting so the other person who had a sighting on the same street will know.   The event really blew my mind.  It was also seen on 2/1/15 in Encinitas.   I will be going to Palm Ave a little more often, with a camera this time. ((name deleted));32.6751380952381;-117.09309047619
