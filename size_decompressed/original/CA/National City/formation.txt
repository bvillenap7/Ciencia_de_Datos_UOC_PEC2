I stepped outside and looking east towards the mountains three red lights shaped into a triangle are visible.  At first i thought they were flares or fireworks but the lights were stationary.  And the three lights remain still for 10 minutes then slowly began to rise for 5-8 minutes and one after another they began to disappear into the night.
