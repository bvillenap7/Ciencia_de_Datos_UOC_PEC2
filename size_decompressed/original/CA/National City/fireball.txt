I could see it through my window as i was seing television.  I went outside and looked at the light. It looked as if a ballon was on fire, it was some sort of fire ball floating object.  I stared at it as it floated by me.  It lost size and brightness as it appeared to float higher then desappeared into the sky, it just dimmed until it dissapeared.;32.6751380952381;-117.09309047619
