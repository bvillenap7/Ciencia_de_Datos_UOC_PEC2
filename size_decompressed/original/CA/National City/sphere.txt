Red Orbs in San Deigo!;2007-03-23 20:00:00;Unknown;Red Orbs in San Deigo! I tried submitting this report yesterday, but for some reason your server would disconnect when I would submit.  Anyway, I got a call at 20:18 on this particular day by a very good friend of mine.  He said, Watch out with the UFO's!  he said this to me in  Spanish.  He described to me that he saw two red glowing orbs stuck together, making semi circles in the air.  Yesterday I spoke to him more about it and to give me the details so I could report it here.  He said that about 20:00 he was outside his house and he saw something catch his eye.  He was facing east at this point.  He decided to use the binoculars to see if he could spot what it was that he saw.  The light that caught his eye seemed to have moved behind a passing cloud, so he directed his view to the end of the cloud.  After looking for it to come out the other end, there was nothing.  For a while he just decided to stay and keep watching the sky when he looked up and saw what appeared to be a red circle doing semi circles in the air.  It was big or low enough to see with the naked eye.  When using the binoculars, he could see that it was actually two orbs stuck together.  He said that it wasn't light, like a flashlight, but more like internal, luminescent light, sort of glowy.  One other thing he said was that after while of observing this, he started to panic for some reason, he said he actually panicked and did not know what to do, or who to tell.  He lost the object after a while when he was trying to refocus the binoculars.  Al i can say about this is that i can't believe I missed it.;32.6751380952381;-117.09309047619
