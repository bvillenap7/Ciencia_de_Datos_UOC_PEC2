strange lights over san diego;2003-01-28 17:00:00;60 sec;strange lights over san diego I looked up in the sky at about 30 degrees above the ground at heading 030 or so and saw what i thought was a jet (I live near a airport) the light got brighter and then dimmer as if a jet was in the turn but i noticed no running lights. then the object seemed to vanish for a second the six bright white lights apeared forming a shape simular to the points on a star of david. The object was very far away because i was walking and the oreintation did not seem to change at all. I heard no sounds and it was cloudy and about to rain so all i saw was the lights. I was a Intelligence specialist in the navy and work at a airport so im very reliable as a witness.;32.6751380952381;-117.09309047619
