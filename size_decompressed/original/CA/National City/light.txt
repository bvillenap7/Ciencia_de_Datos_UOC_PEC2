Three bright lights in the early morning San Diego sky.;2008-11-20 06:00:00;20 seconds;Three bright lights in the early morning San Diego sky. On November 20th, 2008 at approximately 6:00 am. I observed three bright lights in the clear western sky of San Diego, Ca.  The two lights were at 30 degrees and roughly a horizontal configuration and at first seemed similar in brightness as Venus in the early evening sky.  A third light of equal brightness maintained position roughly 5 degrees higher at an 11-oâ€™clock position during the entire observation.  As I drove west toward the lights, I observed the lights maintain a distance from one another that at first blush the lower two could have been lights positioned on the wing tips of a commercial airliner.  As the lights moved closer together, I assumed it was an airliner, even though I could not see a wing structure or fuselage it seemed to be moving away.  The only major discrepancy was that the lights brightness and size remained the same. Just a few seconds after the lights nearly merged, they separated, moving quickly apart in an upward/downward arc, positioning themselves in a vertical configuration.  As I continued west, I lost sight of the objects, as area I entered was predominately covered in a low-lying fog.  At the moment I last saw the objects they were continuing to move apart and separate as individual entities. Unidentified sky objects. Not and airplane. Not a helicopter. Not a flare. Not a balloon.;32.6751380952381;-117.09309047619
Three lights floating in the sky.;2017-02-15 22:00:00;>5-10 minutes;Three lights floating in the sky. I was driving home, going North on the I-805.  In the sky ahead I saw 3 lights, 2 bright ones and 1 not as bright, maybe further or just smaller than the other 2.  I first noticed the 2 bright lights then the smaller one, it may have detached from the other 2 or have been there just didn't notice it at first.  The 2 brighter lights didn't move and the smaller light did, but then they all remained mostly stationary.  I questioned if they were planes but then I saw what I knew was a plane, and the plane just flew past the lights, on what seemed like a normal route to the San Diego airport.  I kept my eye on them since the moment I noticed until I arrived home.  Due to a big tree in the way I don't know what happened to them.;32.6751380952381;-117.09309047619
