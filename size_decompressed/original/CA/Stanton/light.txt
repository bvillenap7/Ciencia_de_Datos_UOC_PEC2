I was lying bed and I felt someone or something lift me up.  I was taken into this room that contained this bright light as soon as you walked in.  I was tied up onto a chair, like an electric chair.  They took pictures of me and they opened up my wrists.  The stuck a computer chip- like thing onto inside my left wrist.  Which I hink has moved up to my inner elbow area.  Then they shined a laser ray gun thing on my wrist and the opening disappered, and I stopped bleeding.  The creatures doing this to me, seemed human.  Except for one thing, they all had a big eye on the back of their heads.  They all looked like men in doctor coats, except the coats weren't white, they were black.  Then they gave me a drink that made me fall asleep.  When I awoke I was on the FLOOR of my bedroom, with out a scratch, other than itchiness on my left arm. that's all;33.8001;-117.9949
