White pulsating object viewed from Moraga CA 94556 at 8pm.;2005-11-15 20:00:00;2 minutes;White pulsating object viewed from Moraga CA 94556 at 8pm. I saw the UFO in my parent's car while heading home from swim practice, it was 8pm and the moon was almost full and I saw this thing flying at a moderatly high speed west,  it was a dim white light that give three bright white flashes every second or so.  As we turned into our driveway, the object turned north in a 90 degree turn without losing any speed.  I would guess it was a high flying object by the size of it, but I could be wrong.   I am an amature astronomer so I know what planes look like, flashing red and green lights but this object's lights are totally white.  I also have Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 and I've downloaded every plane possible and each and every one of them have red and green lights tjhat flash.  This object gave off three bright white flashes every second and I've never seen nothing like it before.;37.8389076923077;-122.118669230769
Bright red light seen only 100 yards at 0 angle  eye level from my house  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;2009-01-17 04:30:00;1 minute;Bright red light seen only 100 yards at 0 angle  eye level from my house  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I have recently seen over the past week two (1) Bright red light twice on different dates 1st sighting (01/09-13/09) and second sighting (01/17/09) both times in the exact same spot no more than 100 yards from my house, right before a curve in the road at 0 degree level of angle, eye level.  It is a very bright, deep red light that does not strobe or blink in any way. Recently at 4:30 AM 01/17/09 I noticed my wireless internet abruptly cut out, and I went to the window to see if it was there, and sure enough it was.  This frightened me somewhat, being as that it keeps coming back, and this time it seemed to directly contact me in getting my attention by knocking out my wireless internet so that I would come to the window.  It was less than 100 yards from my house, and I know this because my road curves at around 100 yards, and it was clearly In front of a driveway no more than 100 yards away because the road curves there.  Clearly it was at eye level also because it was clearly a driveway. The past two times I have seen this bright red light it has stayed completely stationary.  The first time (around 01/09-13/09) it disappeared when a car was starting to come around the bend 100 yards down the street where it curves.  It simply just vanished instantly, like at the speed of light.  Absolutely NO FADE OUT.  The second time, it was like it directly contacted me and got my attention, knocking out my wireless internet!  I feel like I somehow knew it was there so I went to my window and sure enough, there it was, in the EXACT SAME SPOT as a few days ago.  It started to make me somewhat scared so as I was looking at the bright red object I simply told it  “You are kind of scaring me a bit, you know...”  So after observing it for about 30 seconds, Within 2 or 3 seconds of saying what I said looking directly at it, it disappeared!  It’s as if it was being considerate, and obviously showing signs of intelligence???  I live on a very suburban dark street with minimal street lighting and lots of retired folk, and almost everyone is in bed on my street at 4:30 AM I would assume except me because I am a college student still living with parents.  From now on I am going to keep my powerful Panasonic 10mp camera with me at all times if I am up early in the morning so hopefully I can get pictures of whatever this is… I have a feeling many others have seen what I am seeing, especially the Puget sound case in 2007, but not nearly this close… It is as if it is trying to make contact with me.  Hopefully from now on If it comes back I will be able to take high quality pictures and re post with an update. Important note:  This has only started happening to me after I had seen the blinking red black triangles over the freeway in concord (HW 24) over the past month…;37.8389076923077;-122.118669230769
