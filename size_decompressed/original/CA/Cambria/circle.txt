Line of objects, approx. 30 sec spacing emerging from the left of Venus (SSW) mving at rapid speed to the NNE.  Appeared to be a bright sat√©lite.  As time progresses brightness diminished (gaveling the impression that objects were successively higher in the atmosphere.  All objects were individuals (along a line) except (among the last 3rd of the lot) 2 flew side by side (with decent separation).  And, four objects later two flew at a slight diagonal to each other.  In the case of the two pairs the eastern most object stayed on the same track/path as the rest of the procession.  There was no flashing lights typical, of aircraft or any follow up jet exhaust noise;35.5592;-121.0851
