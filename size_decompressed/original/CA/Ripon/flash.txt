Large dome of green light, no trails, no visible singular location of the light.;2015-11-16 04:00:00;10 seconds;Large dome of green light, no trails, no visible singular location of the light. Was driving northbound on highway 99 and saw a large dome of green light fill up the western part of the sky.  Lasted approximately 10 seconds.  No noise was heard though I was in a car, so I can't confirm whether or not it was silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
