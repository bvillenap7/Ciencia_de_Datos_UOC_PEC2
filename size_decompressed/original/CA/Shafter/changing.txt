Was walking into work where co-workers had spotted a hovering object not to far off in the southeastern sky.  One of the co-workers had brought out a pair of binoculars and was observing the object when I had arrived for work that morning.  The place of business is an LPG Refinery and where bring the plant online at the time.  I had an opportunity to observe the object throught the binoculars for about 15 minutes.  The object was that of a diamond shape on end and was made up of several dome shaped serfaces.  It was metalic and what was wierd about the object was that it gave off a multi-color glow of orange, gold, yellow blue and magenta. Like a prisim.  It acted as if it were floating and changing orientation to me the observer.  After about 10 minutes into the viewing it changed shape into a hourse shoe shape but maintianed its multi color.  Something else that was observed was that the color was not as detecable from the ground.  First thought was that it could be some mylar ballons perhaps but if they were they maintianed tight formation, maybe tied together.  Object was however approximatley 15,000 ft. so if it were some kind of ballons they were very large.  Co-workers acted strangely as though it were no big deal.  I can't say that I was excited but very couious.  Note:  I spotted a different object the next day.  Different object structure and no wittnesses.  Observed it for approximately 10 minutes until it vanished from view in the distance.;35.4936;-119.2813
