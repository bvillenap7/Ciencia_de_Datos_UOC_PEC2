Object goes through shinihg hole!  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax??  PD));1996-03-14 10:00:00;10 minutes;Object goes through shinihg hole! I was a little boy when I saw this happen.   I was 7 years old and I was helping my dad fix a motor of a well working Camaro we just got so it was brand new.  My dad said to himself why wouldn't the engine start.  It was possibly 10:00 at night.  But when I looked up I saw a helicopter following an object, but the object wasn't an airplane, it was a ufo!   I would of told my my dad but no one believes when you tell them you see a ufo and you probably wouldn't either.  So I told him nothing, but the object had lights and was going very slow but it threw something and made a shining hole, I thought it was the moon.   Then the object went through it and dissapeared the helicopter tried going through it but the hole dissapeared.   I went into the house because I was scared and turned on the TV and in every channel I saw the same thing.   Ever since I haven't told anyone.  This is what really happened and I'm not crazy because this is real.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
