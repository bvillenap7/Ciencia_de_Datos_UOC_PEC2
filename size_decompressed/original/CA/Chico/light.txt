It appeared to be at great altitude be cause the light seemed to be entirely reflected light.  It was visible for approximately 2 minutes. I am a disabled veteran who served in the United States Air Force for 8 years.  I have been an avid aircraft enthusiast since a small boy. I am 42 years old. On the night of this sighting, I was out closing up my workshop for the night. It was very clear out with no moon or clouds.  I was facing south while walking into the house.  I always like to look at the stars and happened to notice a bright one straight up to the south. It was gold in color with the same brightness as Venus after sunset. It was then that I notice that it was moving to the east-northeast at a rapid speed. The light was constant and bright, no flicker.  As it traversed across my fied of vision it went behind the top floor of my home.  I ran around to the front yard and continued to follow its path across the sky.  By now it was to the east of me and it suddenly gave off a bright flash of reflected light as from a mirror. It then started to decrease in brightness as it disappeared over the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  I note that the light remained steady as I viewed it from its aft end. No afterburners, or other lights were seen.  I have seen the same kind of light twice before only traveling from due west to due east in the predawn hours.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
A constant golden colored bright light traversed the pre-dawn sky from west to east  with no sound.;2003-07-04 04:05:00;90 seconds;A constant golden colored bright light traversed the pre-dawn sky from west to east  with no sound. I was walking into my place of employment in the early hours of the morning.  I am a cook at a local nursing home so my day starts very early.  Entrance to the building for staff is at the side in the back but we park way out front so we have to walk about 30  yards along the side. I was about half way to the entrance and was looking up at what I asume to be Mars?  I was facing south-southeast and Mars was at its apex in the night sky.  I suddenly noticed an equally bright golden colored light approaching from the west(my right), crossed in front of Mars and headed due east with no changing of course. The object appeared as a bright, golden colored light with a steady glow. Although the stars all had a slight flicker to them this morning, the object did not.  I got the impression of it being at a high altitude.  This all took place about an hour before sunrise.  The object came out of the west as a bright object but as it traversed the sky it dimmed in brightness which I found odd as it was approaching the sunrise.  I got the impression that this was a controlled atmospheric reentry.  I have witnessed the shuttle reentry before in the past and this reminded me of it. This is not the first time I have seen this,  I have witnessed this event about 8 times over the past 10 years and the discription is always the same including the directions. Also I have never noticed any sound associated with these events. I am an ex-USAF serviceman that is an avid aircraft enthusiast and am well acquainted with most aircraft both civilian and military.

Orange star-like ball of light, erratic motion, no noise.;2005-01-12 22:15:00;10 min;Orange star-like ball of light, erratic motion, no noise. Large bright star-like light, mostly orange.  Travelled from N or NE towards South, basically in a line, but with an erratic motion: pausing, moving up and down randomly, etc.  There was no aircraft noise, no flashing lights, no red/green/white lights that would normally be seen on aircraft.  Light faded out as it moved towards the south, seemingly moving farther away.  Observers: two 30-year-old women. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Clear day in Febuary,6 lights edge of the atmosphere drifting north to south , watched for several minutes.;2007-02-21 15:30:00;15-20 minutes;Clear day in Febuary,6 lights edge of the atmosphere drifting north to south , watched for several minutes. I was finishing a job up working on this ladies rv when she mentioned these lights up in the sky very high near the edge of space. Anyway it was a beautifull sunnyday with clear skies. We saw 6 lights in what appeared to be in a V formation not moving just like floating very high.As we were talikng about the fact it couldn't be Geese flying south because of there elevation was way to high,and the fact that there where no blinking green or red lights, and the fact that no other aicraft in the sky at the time. A few minutes later a Piper cub flies by at about 5000 feet the first thing we notice on the plane are the blinking lights and these lights or spheres just seem to have just disappeared.

We saw2 bright lights traveling across the night sky at a high rate of speed in formation. ((NUFORC Note:  STS and ISS?  PD));2007-08-19 21:10:00;2 min;We saw two bright lights traveling across the night sky at a high rate of speed in some type of formation. At approximately 9:10 PM on Sunday August 20, 2007, my son Matthew and I were sitting outside on my dock talking and admiring the night sky. Looking to the North West Matthew asked, “What or those two lights up there? Planes?” I looked to where he was pointing. It was to the two bottom stars of the big dipper. There were 2 bright lights traveling across the sky from west northwest to the east southeast. They were not flashing. They did not have any color like an aircraft light. These were single lights. The distance apart was approximately 3 inches at an arms length. They did not change direction nor did the space between them change from what I could see. They were traveling much faster then any aircraft that I have ever seen and the lights were much brighter. The total time they were in my view until out of view was no more then 90 seconds. As they passed overhead I did not here any engine noise as from an aircraft. I told my son that it is probably the ISS or possibly the shuttle but today I looked up their orbit at the time and they were nowhere near the west coast of California last night. We could not identify them as any kind of craft. Just two bright lights traveling across the night sky at a high rate of speed in some type of formation. ((NUFORC Note:  August 19 fell on a Sunday.  Probably the ISS and Space Shuttle, which had undocked.  PD));39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
multiple lights/orbs traveling east to west in clear daylight;2008-03-01 14:00:00;1 -2 minutes;Witnessed unexplained multiple lights/orbs traveling east to west in clear daylight.  First impression was that they might be balloons.  However, a smaller group of two broke off from the others and traveled in the opposite direction at a rapid speed. My neighbor was outdoors at the time, so I called out to him to confirm the sighting.  He could not distinguish what the objects where, so he went to his garage and brought out binoculars.  We both observed the objects through the binoculars.  The objects appeared to be indistinguishable (reflected?) lights or orbs. Unable to clearly make out forms we came to differing conclusions.  He believed  that what we observed must rationally be birds flying at high attitude.  I could not come to a definitive conclusion, fore I have often in my 50 plus years observed birds in flight and never did they appear like this.  I only know that I witnessed glowing lights or orbs in an asymmetrical formation.  To me, they are unexplained.

Bright- non blinking, then dissapearing, lights observed flying over Chico ca area 12/22-12/23 2009.;2009-12-23 03:10:00;3 minutes;Bright- non blinking, then dissapearing, lights observed flying over Chico ca area 12/22-12/23 2009. Location: 12/23/09 West Chico, Ca 95928  I've been going to bed early lately around 9:00 and waking up around 2 to 3 am.  Early in the morning of 12/22/09, I went out to have a smoke at around 4:30 am to have a smoke.  I looked up to the east side of town to see a light flying from north east to south west.  It was bright enough for me to think it may be an airplane, but as I looked for any sign of blinking lights, I found none. I was excited that finally I had seen something without the blinking lights so I looked on.  I was careful to listed for noise of which I heard none.  The light then sort of fizzled out and dissapeared.  I have seen many satellites, and this was much brighter than that.   Almost like a helicopter spot light from a distance with no noise.  I really didn't think too much of it at the time. The next morning 12/23/09, I went out at about 3:10 am to have another smoke.  The previous incident was still on my mind as I walked out there.  I was in the middle of thinking how unlikely it would be to see something again, when I looked up and there it was again!  This time it was even a bit brighter than before.  Same, no blinking lights, no  sound.  Flying from northeast to southwest, only this one had a more southerly direction. I actually walked down the road about 500 ft to follow it's course.  I could clearly see it shining through some trees before it moved out into the open.  Very  whitish light, similar to a spot light on a helicopter.  NO NOISE!  It appeared to stop and start a couple of times and then blinked out again!  It could have been miles away for all I know, but based on the very bright clear light it was producing, it seemed much closer. I would estimate that it was no more than a miles distance at the very most. I am aware there is an airport on the north side of town.  I am also aware of what airplanes look and sound like, as well as helocopters.  I lived in L.A. and saw police helicopters all the time.  And there are no blimps or hot air balloons around here.  This was making zero noise with NO blinking lights. I even checked a satellite tracking site to see if there were any flyovers scheduled for that time and saw none.  The international space station was somewhere over Hawaii at the time and flying from west to east.  So I ruled that out. Not sure what it was, but I already know they exist so I'm not freaked out.  Just wanted to see if possibly anybody else has seen something in my area.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
Light moving across sky and then dissipates and disapears within 15-20 seconds.;2014-02-22 19:00:00;15 seconds;Light moving across sky and then dissipates and disapears within 15-20 seconds. I have been living in Chico since 1977.  In 1987 I was laying in a field of grass and looking up at the sky and it was evening about 11pm.  I noticed a small light moving among the stars.  The light moved in every direction impossibly.  It moved in circles and up and down and side-ways and it made no sound. It looked like a star or satellite but like I said it moved im-possibly. It did not move across the entire sky as it only covered a little space in the sky.  It continued for a few minutes and then dissipated. It was soon out of my vi-sion.  This has happened 10 times in my life the recent being In February this year 2014 seeing 6 lights within a two week period and one night seeing 2.  It always happened at nightmore frequently around 7pm. I was in upper Bidwell park. 1 light was more orange than the usual yellow/white star looking light.  There was never any sound.  Some moved irratically and dissipated quickly while others moved straight and very fast and dissipated (at least 1000mph based on time and distance travelled) or turned slightly and dissipated. It felt as if when I noticed them is when they dissapeared.  There is an airport near where I have seen most of these lights.  I have been walking at night in the park for years and am very aware of all of the different air traffic including satellites.  No other craft like airplanes or other lights followed the lights.  1 time one of the lights turned from white to orange as it dissipated;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
Report of Unusual Lights seen over Chico, California.;2014-04-18 22:00:00;10 minutes;Report of Unusual Lights seen over Chico, California. Report of Unusual Lights Seen in Chico, CA  18 April 2014.  	 At approximately 2200hrs., on the evening of 18 April, 2014, my daughter and I spotted approximately 10 luminous lights traveling in an arc from the southeast moving to the West.  I first noticed two bright orange-colored lights moving across the night sky as I was driving Northeast on E. 1st Avenue in the city of Chico, CA. 	I immediately pointed out the lights to my 13 year-old daughter, who asked me what I thought they were.  I pulled the car over at the nearest safe place, at 1035 Village Lane.  We exited the car and immediately noticed that several other lights were appearing over the trees from the horizon.  We were facing the Southeast. 	The lights would appear over the horizon from the Southeast and travel Westward.  The lights appeared in pairs as if they were in a formation.  The lights had a steady, light-orange tint to them and were fairly large.  It was hard to judge their size, but I'm familiar with how bright and large Venus can appear, so I would approximate their size as if 5 or more Venuses were put together into a single object.  The objects would travel in a straight course, heading Westward and then disappear from the sky.  No noise was emitted from the objects.  We observed the lights for a total of about 10 minutes.  Most of the objects appeared to have a constant speed, with one object being fairly faster than the others. During this period of observation my daughter took a one-minute video of some of the objects with her ipod.  She captured three or four of the objects as they moved through the sky.  I will email the video after finishing this report. After pulling over at 1035 Village Lane, I called my wife (our house is close to where my daughter and I were making our observations) and asked her if she saw anything in the sky.  Both she and my 16 year-old son went to the front yard and saw some of the lights my daughter and I observed in the Western sky.  However, my wife and son both reported seeing other objects to the East.  They saw two dimmer objects compared to those seen the West.  They seemed higher and farther away.  First she saw two separate lights come close together and they appeared to cross each others flight path.  One light continued on its flight path, while the other turned into three distinct luminous objects, and then quickly merged into one object again. It is interesting to note that this observation was made in the medium-sized city (population 87,000) of Chico, CA.  The Chico Municipal Airport is not far away from the observed lights and the lights appeared to be fairly close to the usual air-traffic patterns of the airport.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
