Extraordinarily fast moving spherical object with pulsing light...;2007-03-20 21:11:00;5 seconds;Extraordinarily fast moving spherical object with pulsing light... On the evening of Tuesday, March 20, 2007 at 9:11PM, in Chico, California, I was walking with my dog NE on Satinwood Way, just having turned N from Eaton Rd. I looked into the sky and there was a spherical object moving at an extraordinarily fast speed (faster than anything I have seen with my naked eye) on a diagonal down towards earth. I would say it was about 100 feet off of the ground.  There was a light pulsing from the object that was somewhat like a strobe light although the lights did not move like a strobe light. The light was pulsing and was very bright, almost incandescent. I only saw the object for approximately 4-5 seconds and then it disappeared as if the light was suddenly turned off. The object was seemingly gone and I did not see it again although I waited for a few minutes. My dig did not notice and there was no one else around on this semi dark cul de sac.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512

While in our backyard we saw an orange shere that seemed to have a faint whitish aura.  It came from the west heading east, slowly with no sound at all.  After we retracked from behind a tree less than 10 seconds later it was many miles further away than any aircraft we've seen travel.  It was heading in the direction of Beale Air Force base.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
