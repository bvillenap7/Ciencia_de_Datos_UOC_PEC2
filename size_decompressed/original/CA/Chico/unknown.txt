different shaped craft seen nightly from my front porch>more than 1  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars, we suspect.  PD));2010-10-01 07:00:00;daily;different shaped craft seen nightly from my front porch>more than 1 I live in Chico, ca. and for the past 3 months i have been noticing some strange objects in the sky. The larger craft are spread out in different places in the sky.They stay at the same spot night after night. They all emit red, green, and blue lights. There are also other craft that move in the sky all over zipping back and forth. They are different than the others as to size and shape. They seem to spin alful fast at times. Lately i've noticed them moving in an octagon pattern that when they finish the shape there looks like they throw off some kind of clould like stuff. At night you can see them moving thru the sky leaving a bright purplish contrail. Something is happening and it's real strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars, we suspect.
