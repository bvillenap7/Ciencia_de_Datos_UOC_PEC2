We had seen a couple of shooting stars and airplanes pass by. This though I have never seen before. An object resembling a very large star or planet moving from the north into view.This object  moving at a high speed then dims itself, or drastically changes elevation. From my viewpoint these are the only explanations I have come up with. This object looked like it became smaller. The funny thing was that this object was moving more into view. Different than looking at something above you only to see it dim into the horizon. This dimmed from the horizon as it moved overhead. I am not aware of any craft that could move so quickly.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
Three circular objects moving fast and without sound in a formation pattern;2007-04-20 23:15:00;10 seconds;Three circular objects moving fast and without sound in a formation pattern My wife and I were leaving an event at the Chico fair gorunds and as we were walking to our car I noticed 3 small circular lights in the sky, they were heading north than made a sweeping turn to the west.  They appeared to be larger than a star, somewhat flat and cicular, and there ligts were reddish in the center and more white around the edges.  The lights did not blink or pulse and was more dual than bright. As they approached from the soiuth, they were moving quite fast then slowes down, the two objects in front seemed to be jocking in the sky then moved very close to one and other as the third in the rear followed.  They moved very swiftly and made a big turn to the west then ascended upward until they disappeared.  There was no noise and they moved like nothing I have ever seen.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
Plane chasing lights moving oddly;2007-07-12 21:00:00;5-10 mins;Plane chasing lights moving oddly We saw a plane blinking and what looked like a satalitte folling behind it.  After a second or two it started blinking green, after that appeared to go straight up then down while staying solid green.  It started moving back up but changed to blinkning red. We lost sight of it after that.  After 10-20 mins 2 of us saw another plane and a green light moving like a shooting star diaganoly down away from plane.  All four of us saw the same thing witch kinda freaked us out.  Was definatly something wierd.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
Craft emitting strong white beam hovers over my road, then checks out the adjacent hills.;2012-07-23 23:30:00;5-8 minutes;Craft emitting strong white beam hovers over my road, then checks out the adjacent hills. I live at the mouth of a small canyon on the edge of the foothills.   Around 11:30 PM on July 23, 2012, I happened to glance out my second floor bedroom window and saw a large, round, white, very bright light hovering over the narrow, rural, dead-end road that I live on. It was a little higher than the telephone poles and seemed as wide as the road.  I had seen a similar object several months ago, but this time it was closer to my house.  I quickly turned off my house lights and when I did that, the bright light gradually turned away from me as a searchlight might.  It began to slowly drift toward the northeast, all the while moving the white beam over the foothills.  I could easily see oak trees illuminated by this process.  Occasionally the beam was directed into the sky.  I could not discern the shape of the object (although in my first sighting I saw, dimly, a classic saucer shape).  There were some red lights on the object which in the first sighting were! clearly arranged in a circle near the top of the object.  This time I couldnâ€™t see their position as clearly.  The craft eventually drifted around a distant hill and out of sight.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
