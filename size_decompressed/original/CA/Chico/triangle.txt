Three silver/grey triangle crafts, at very high altitude, no sound, no lights. Chico Ca. 1992/93;1993-02-25 23:30:00;20 seconds;Three silver/grey triangle crafts, at very high altitude, no sound, no lights. Chico Ca. 1992/93 I was attending Chico State University in 1992/93. I was a Junior living on campus in Shasta Hall. I had just arrived at a party one cold night and did not really know many people there. I went outside to the backyard where I stood on a wooden deck. As I was looking up to the very clear, cold, and starlit sky I saw a faint object out of the corner of my vision. As I looked up and towards my left I saw 3 grey/silver triangle objects exact in size flying in a line, one in front of the other. These objects had no sound, and no lights. They seemed to be in exact distance from each other.They also appeared to be very high in altitude My sighting lasted about 20 seconds before the crafts moved across the sky and then out of sight, behind a large oak tree. Something very strange happend as I was viewing these objects. Everything seemed to go silent as I watched them fly over me. As I remember everything went silent as I viewed them. After they moved out of sight all the party noise(music, laughing, people talking) returned in an instant. I was astonished! No one else had witnessed what I just saw. I felt amazed, confused and a little scared. I had never seen anything like this in my entire life. Later that night as I walked home to my dorm I could not stop thinking about what I saw that night. When I got to my dorm, I went to my friend's room, woke her, and told her what I had witnessed. Since that night I have only told a few people about my expierience until now. I will remember that night for the rest of my life. I often still think about what I saw that night,  10 years ago. I have many questions, about this unique moment, I just don't know who has the real answeres. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
Silent, dark triangle shaped UFO sighting;1996-05-25 23:00:00;6 Seconds;Silent, dark triangle shaped UFO sighting I was standing on my apartments balcony, drinking some cold tea as it was a pretty hot night that night.  My apartment was situated very near the central part of the Chico, a well lit, bustling with nightlife, college town, suburban atmosphere city in Northern California.  Suddenly from behind my apartment or coming from the opposite direction from where I was looking out, a massive, triangular shaped object flew over my apartment, moving towards the central part of the city.  What scared me almost as much as it's unnatural appearance, was the fact that it didn't make even the slightest amount of noise.  There were no lights on it that I could see in the short amount of time it was visible to me, and I believe it was black in color, although I could be wrong as it was quite a dark night.  The funny part of this story, would be that I'm pretty much a non-believer in everything, but my boyfriend, who was in the living room when this occurred, believes in UFOs, aliens, and all of that kinda supernatural stuff.  It was with that, that I entered the living room, told him what I had seen, only to find that he didn't believe me!  Am I the only one whom has seen such a craft?;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
I was surprised to noticed a large black triangular-shaped-wingless object cross the road directly in front of me flying about twenty f;1998-11-17 18:30:00;6 Minutes;I was surprised to noticed a large black triangular-shaped-wingless object cross the road directly in front of me flying about twenty feet from the ground. I was travling northbound on Hwy 99. The road curved ahead of me and it was at this moment when I noticed what I thought to be a falling star. I glanced at this object briefly and then turned my attention back on the road. Out of curiosity, I looked back to where I first noticed the object and did a doubletake when I noticed that it was still their. Not only was it still their, but it appeared to be even closer than before, and I was given the impression that it was travling at an enourmous volacity. As I observed this object with a keen interest, I noticed a long blue contrail behind it. This contrail appeared similar That of NASA's proposed Ion propolsion system, exept for one thing their now appeard to be what resembled orange fireballs shooting out the back of this object, and through the contrail. This was very unsettling because I thought I was witnessing an airborne tragedy, A plane on fire, plummeting to the ground. Indeed this object appeared to be loosing altitude with great abandon, and I was surprised once more to see the object bank hard and change directions approximately 180º's changing from a South-easterly direction to more of a North-westwardly direction. The object's speed increased greatly after It had modified its waypoints. I past an orchard and momentarily lost site of this object. I thought that was the last that I would see of this object, until it the road directly ahead of me flying about twenty feet from the ground. The triangular object was now flying very slow, and its distinct triangular form was highlighted by small red lights along what appeared to be the sides of the object. These small red lights were alligned in rows along two opposite sides of the object. Their were three small bright white lights, one on each corner of the object. In the center of the object was a large red glowing light about three feet in diameter, not typical of any aircraft I know of. It crossed the highway heading twords an open residential area with many houses. I crossed over a bridge and tur! ned off of the highway onto a small sidestreet. My investigative nature becconed me to fallow this object, which is exactly what happened. I was driving along the small sidestreet, and the object was positioned completely parellel to me. I clocked it with my speedometer, it was travling at approximately 25 MPH. I rolled down my window to observe the sound which I was sure an object of this proportion (about 60 feet long) would make flying at such a low altitude. I was stunned as I concluded that this object made absolutely no sound. It did not rumble or make any vibrations. I could not hear the wind whistling through its wings, because it did not have any. I lost site of the object as it again changed course and ducked below the tree line. With the information which I was able to acertain from this encounter, I can conclude that what I observed was not an airplane. It was certainly an object, It was flying, and I failed to identify it with any object which I am familiar with. It is with sound mind and being, that I certify everything stated above as truth, and the facts stated heriegn reflect the best of my knowledge and recolection of this encounter.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
Huge slow flying triangular object blocking out sky during meteor shower on california's I-5 outside chico.;2001-11-18 03:00:00;1 minute;Huge slow flying triangular object blocking out sky during meteor shower on california's I-5 outside chico. I stopped to watch meteor shower at a rest stop on I-5 just outside of chico california. When I went between two big trucks to block out some bothersome lights I saw out of the corner of my eye what looked at first like several meteors traveling together. When I looked in that direction I did not see any meteors. As I started to look in another direction I noticed something moving across the sky blocking out the stars. That was how I determined the shape. It was triangular, very large, moving slowly in an easterly direction. There were no lights and no noise. It was hard to judge the size of the object but I estimate that if it was flying low (as in 2 or 3 thousand feet it would have been the size of at least a football field. It disapeared behind the truck trailer and I was unable to find it again when I moved around to the other side of the truck.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
Observed flying triangle with five orange lights as it flew silently and slowly in an eastwardly direction over city.;2004-12-09 00:04:00;5 seconds;Observed flying triangle with five orange lights as it flew silently and slowly in an eastwardly direction over city. Shortly after midnight I witnessed one large triangle-shaped craft/object fly silently over Chico State University almost directly overhead from where I was standing. The object was visable as it flew through the low, blowing, broken overcast. Five orange lights were visable running around the circumference of the object, none were particularly bright. I would estimate its altitude was between 1,500-3000 feet, and its speed between 50-80 mph. (quite slow) The direction of travel was east.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512

Triangle shaped formation of lights slowed and stopped, then changed direction and flew off.;2010-07-28 22:00:00;4 min;Triangle shaped formation of lights slowed and stopped, then changed direction and flew off. On the night of July 18, 2010 at around 10:00 pm in Chico, Ca, while walking home from the store, I witnessed what I thought at first was an airplane.  Upon looking at it closer I noticed that the light formation on it was different than the airplanes that I’m so used to seeing. What caught my attention was that it was moving abnormally slow for an airplane, but on par with maybe a helicopter or blimp.  For a minute, I thought it could be an ultra light aircraft, but it was completely silent.  Next I thought maybe the lights on the bottom of a blimp, but I have never witnessed a blimp in 15 years of living here.  My best guess was that it was triangle shaped, but it was very hard to make out with city lights around.  This thing whatever it was made absolutely no noise.  It kept slowing down and finally stopped and sat there for about 10 seconds before changing course.  It was initially heading west but stopped and changed course to heading due north.  When it changed direction it went straight over head.  As it flew over I tried to make out what it was.  It had three white lights in a triangle formation with one blinking red light in the middle with one additional slightly dimmer blinking white light mixed in.   The red light was slightly brighter than the rest of the lights.  It didn’t seem to be very far up at all, and it wasn’t very big that I could tell.  Before it changed course, it was sort of near the moon I could make out sort of a roundish looking bottom to it, but only for a second.  As it moved northward, it picked up speed to what would be expected of an airplane.  I ran into the house to get my video camera, but when I came out it was way far off. I am quite used to planes flying over and see them often.  I don’t however EVER see a plane slow down, stop, and then completely change course.   It was very eerie watching that fly overhead with no noise at all!   The blinking red light seemed to indicate that it was manmade, but who knows?   Whatever it was it gave me the creeps!   I’m a student here, and have good eyesight and wasn’t at all drunk or anything.   This was not the first weird thing I’ve seen here either.  On Dec, 23 and 24 of 2009, I saw a ball of light out in the distance that looked like the spot light on the front of a helicopter, but got dimmer and after it travelled some distance faded into nothing.  I saw this twice in two days!   I followed the second one for a block or so on foot just watching before it finally blinked out.  I highly doubt it was Chinese lanterns as some might say.  These were not flickering, and they were Venus bright at times and silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
