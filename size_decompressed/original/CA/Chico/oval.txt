UFO zaps meteor, moves  right diagonally, then moves backwards and zaps Meteor.;2017-09-01 22:21:00;19 seconds;UFO zaps meteor, moves  right diagonally, then moves backwards and zaps Meteor. I was taking a picture of this planet, and video taping it.  Along with two bright objects sitting in the center of the view of the camera. This video attached is 1:19 seconds long, one minute 19 seconds long. At the first of the video you will see birds flying in and around the view. At the one minute mark a UFO comes from the bottom left and moves to the top RIGHT. At first when i saw this, i just thought it was a bird flying. it is actually a UFO, saucer shaped oval shape, with energy coming out both sides making it look like an upside down V or upside down U.  Freeze this video and take a still picture and negative picture.  You can see the object is oval, emitting energy out from the sides , both sides. At first the video shows a planet in the bottom left at the 7 o'clock position, and a meteor in the middle, that is the bright spot, and a meteor to the left of it curving around. The meteor in the middle is headed towards earth.. It has been in that position a long time.  I believe the two bright objects at the top and bottom that are horizontal are some kind of space station. This video was taken on  Friday, September 1, 2017, &10:21:33 PM, about 70 to 80 degrees looking east above the horizon, of Chico, Calif.  Looking almost straight up from my back yard.  One fist doubled up is one degree.  Check it out, when this UFO went backwards zapping this meteor, I knew then , and later when re-looking at it, that it was not a BIRD  It does not look like the birds flying around in the first part of the Video.  birds do not fly backwards. watch it tell me what you think, and I will tell you what I think. I believe a UFO or military vehicle it moving this meteor away from hitting earth.  Oh, this happened at night, and I could not see any of this brightness with my unaided eye...only on IFA RED, with my FLIR ONE ATTACHMENT to my I phone 5 camera.  Not on a digital camera.. VIDEO is sent to the email address below. ((NUFORC Note:  We received and viewed the false color video, and cannot be certain that we see either the alleged meteor, or the alleged UFO.  We do see an object that appears to us to be possibly a spider, seemingly climbing up a spider web, but we cannot be sure what the object is.  We have conveyed this information to the source of the video, and he disagrees strongly with our assessment of the footage.  In another video from the witness, we see what we suspect are insects in flight.  PD));39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
