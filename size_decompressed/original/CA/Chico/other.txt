A large slow moving craft was observed, first at a distance as a bright light, then passing directly overhead.;1979-07-01 01:00:00;3-5 minutes;A large slow moving craft was observed, first at a distance as a bright light, then passing directly overhead. Early in the summer of 1979, a friend and myself had just entered Hwy 70 from a back road and at the Chico cut-off.  We noticed a bright light in the distance - I don't remember the color - moving oddly in some fashion.  I am not sure what actually caught our attention.  Perhaps the object was moving too slowly or in an unusual flight path.  In any case we wondered what it was and pulled over to watch for a minute.  The second we got out of the truck, the thing changed direction and came directly for us.  It moved slowly, silently and steadily until it passed directly over our heads.  Since we had no perspective for distance against the night sky, I cannot estimate the size or altitude.  It appeared to be as large as 747 and flying at say 1000 feet.  I clearly remember that it looked to be the shape of an eye with a hole in the middle where the iris would be.  I can remember seeing stars right through the middle of the object.  I clearly remember the thing looking to be diamond or eye shaped, however, with so many reports of wishbone or chevron shaped objects, I must admit that my own eye/brain may have filled in detail where no structure existed.  No sound could be heard and it continued to move slowly into the SW until disappering.  It appeared to be black and I think some lights could be seen...but not ordinary aircraft lights. I guess that it had a very bright light shining forward but I am not sure which lights had actually caught our attention.  I am quite convinced that I saw an experimental [stealth] blimp or otherwise operating out of nearby Beale AFB.  Maybe it was a stealth blimp piloted by aliens (-:;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512

I noticed it because of how fast it appeared to be moving.   I stopped to see what it was.  In a matter of seconds the object stopped and hovered in front of me, I was excited and scared, and went to turn my car around and get the ..... out of there.  As I started to move my car the object flashed and disapeared to the right.  It moved at a speed that was just a flash, not even estimatable.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
small silver object, low flying in very strait line emitting what looked to be a thick bright billowy contrail the shape and length of ;1999-09-24 07:00:00;3-5 min;small silver object, low flying in very strait line emitting what looked to be a thick bright billowy contrail the shape and length of a comet tai ended at a point and abruptly, no dispersion of smoke. In car returning home the last 2 blocks, up in the sky what looked to be at the altitude of a small plane, but I could not make out the object only twice in its flight did I glimpse, the color silver.  What was so odd was the tail of what seemed to be a contrail from the object immediately from the back end that was much thicker than the object itself and extended about 15 lengths of the object into a point, as though it were the tail of a comet.  The contrail was thick and solid, but billowy looking and was very illuminated or bright, but it did appear like smoke that was coming from the object.  It did not trail off in a long dispersed fashion, like it does from high flying aircraft that leave contrails across the sky.  This stuff coming out of this thing was very contained in its appearance.  The object traveled very slow almost 4 min in my vision while I parked the car in the drive went in the house, grabbed the phone came back outside and called my husband at work and proceeded to describe what I was seeing to him.  It traveled as though I were seeing it from the side view but as it moved farther away it was not exactly perpendicular to me.  The path was more like southwest to northeast. (If I have my bearings, correct)  Clear sky and no other aircraft in the area I will send drawing by fax.

Unidentified flying man;2001-10-15 15:00:00;30 sec.;Unidentified flying man I know this may seem strange, but it isn't a joke.  I was walking my dog  south down Notre Dame Blvd. when I happened to look to my left. Across the street there was a row of two story aprtment dwellings. I saw a man come floating down thru the air like when someone would if he was attached to a parachute. The only thing was--there was no parachute above him! I hurried to the rear of the apartment complex and there was no sign of a man or a parachute--this was like less than a minute and a half later! It would have taken longer than that for him to gather up his 'chute if he had one! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
Man floating thru the air;2004-06-30 16:00:00;30 seconds;man floating thru the air This was not a craft.  It was in human form.  I was walking my dog down the sidewalk across the street from an apartment complex.  Behind the apartment complex there were several tall pine trees.  I happened to glance in the direction of the apartment complex as a moving object caught my eye.   It was a man above the trees just floating leisurly down toward the ground, as though he was wearing a parachute, except, to my amazement, there was no parachute above him!   And he was still above the tall trees just slowly floating down!   But as soon as he floated down lower he disappeared behind the tall trees and apartments.  I ran as fast as I could to get to the area where he would have to be if he landed, but THERE WAS NO ONE THERE!  AND, THERE WAS NO PARACHUTE EITHER,  Yes, I did check for a parachute because I could not believe what I had seen!  I was wondering how could this be...unless it was Jesus Christ, this is not supposed to happen!   Has anyone else ever reported anything like this before?

Three yellow lights in a row parallel to the horizon moving slowly in an up and down motion and a side to side.;2014-10-21 03:00:00;2 hours+;Three yellow lights in a row parallel to the horizon moving slowly in an up and down motion and a side to side. I woke up to use the restroom around 2:30 AM and upon my return to bed my wife said she saw a three lighted object in the sky.  I looked at where she was pointing and noticed three lights moving up and down then side to side in a lazy slower way.  The lights were yellow in color and a little bigger than a big star in the sky.  They would grow brighter then fade almost to nothing. They were parallel to the horizon, in a line with each other, and close together. I grabbed my binoculars and steadied them to the side if the window pane to get a closer look. Upon seeing them I also noticed four fainter light beams emitting from the UFO in a direction of NE. SE. EW. SW. We were both excited to see our first UFO and thought it wouldn't happen again but to both of our surprises  it happened again last night, (10/24/14) which is why I am writing this report.  I got smarter and while it was happening last night I download a night sky app to see where in the sky I was seeing it.   The lights were in between Jupiter and the star Algeiba. It has happened around the same time for two nights as far as we noticed.  Hope someone else sees them one night too!

golden ball with tail of sparks over sierra Nevada Mountains.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD));2016-07-27 21:35:00;1 minute;golden ball with tail of sparks over sierra Nevada Mountains I was at the west edge of Chico, looking east toward the Sierra Nevada Mountains, with a dark sky above.  I saw a large, bright golden ball with a thick tail of what looked to be sparks, moving at about the rate of an airplane.  It was moving from south to north and lowering in altitude gradually, not steeply.   As I watched, the ball split into two pieces and both continued in the same direction.  The one in the front was larger than the one in the rear and it began moving faster than the smaller one in the rear, so the distance between the two became greater as they continued in the same direction from south to north and lower toward the mountains.   From the time I first saw it, as one ball with a tail of sparks until after it split into two and both disappeared behind the silhouette of the Sierras might have been a minute. I could not see any red/green lights that would indicate it was an airplane, and it moved much slower and was much larger than a meteorite,! and it was too close to be a comet.

It was new years eve and the employee there told us they close at 6pm and she unlocked the door to let us out.  So we know it was exactly 6pm.  A drive to my house should take no more than 10 minutes from that store,yet we arrived at my house at 6:45 pm. We have discussed this a few times and with family and we can't figure out how we lost time.  We were both shaken up about it at the time.  It still bothers us because there isn't a logical explanation as to what happened to us that night.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512

Large Structure Class UFO with Drone/Repair Class UFO.;2019-08-13 04:00:00;60+ minutes observed;Large Structure Class UFO with Drone/Repair Class UFO. Large ufo structure class sighting.  Additional drone type ufo doing repairs along edges of large structure.  In the space where the large structure sat, there was a clearly definable dark, very dark area, which was extremely distinguishable from the sky which was starting to get lighter by the minute due to the sun rising.  There is no possibility that it was a cloud, it was precise and had an exact shape.  I couldn't take an adequate picture, but I drew a picture of the approximate shape.  If it weren't buried In a pile of old files, I would post it.   However, the large structure wasn't the only thing that convinced me it had to be an alien origin.  In the center of the larger object it appeared a set of lights began moving to possibly open up a what I would assume to be a hangar type area?  And then a light appeared and began moving along the outer edges of the overall object very precisely.  Moving most likely at hundreds of miles an hour.  It would stop every so often and light up the area it looked as though it was repairing the hull of something for only fractions of a second to a second or two at most.  Every so often it would move much quicker between what I would call  apparent repair points and changed directions as it went along the structure multiple times, with very precise movements.  The overall structure took up about 1/4-1/3 of the sky that was visible within our eyesight and leaning back to see as much as we could.  My girlfriend and stone cold sober roommate witnessed in addition to myself.  I probably should have posted this much earlier but I have been skeptical of what I saw considering how crazy it was.  Also have been searching for any account of an identical sighting.  I've never seen anything like this before and this is coming from someone who has seen a dozen different ufos with a dozen different people.  It made me feel incredibly small.  To anyone who doesn't believe this story, that's up to you.  But trust me I know what we saw and I am only posting this in hopes of creating a better account of sightings such as this. I probably could add more detail and try to make this post more legit seeking but that's again not my point. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
