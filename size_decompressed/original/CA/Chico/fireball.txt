No impact felt or heard. it was expected. Husband and I were by window when large fiery emerald green type globe with fiery yellow tail started to descend gradually across sky.  It appeared to be close and though it went behind trees, we expected to hear or feel impact or have a fire due to the dryness of our area and the fieryness of the object.  Neither hearing or feeling an impact occurred.   When I phoned the local sheriffs dept. to tell them there may be a fire in the vicinity due to the object colliding in the outskirts, they referred me to call NUFORC.    I then proceeded to call that #. Later I sent report to both NUFORC and Mufon and contacted the local paper.   All items mentioned were saved in my files and when I spoke to NUFORC recently it was suggested if I still had these items to resubmit my sighting on this net site and send in articles, which I have done on 9/27/99. ((NUFORC Note:  We did speak via telephone with this witness, on the date indicated, and we consider her to be exceptionally reliable.  NUFORC received many other reports from California on this date, including a report from an FAA ARTCC supervisor.  PD));39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
Four glowing objects slowly moving across the night sky, leaving a short trail.;1999-09-01 21:30:00;20 seconds?;Four glowing objects slowly moving across the night sky, leaving a short trail. At approximately 9:30pm on September 1, 1999, my girlfriend and I walked outside to go for a walk. Immediately, we both spotted four objects in the sky. The head of the objects were glowing, unsure of the color but I remember bluish/green and my girlfriend recalls at least one turning a reddish color. The objects seemed to be at a low altitude, but I'm not sure because I can't confirm how large the objects were. (MUCH bigger than a star....maybe 1/8 to 1/10 the size of a full moon? I couldn't hear any sound, but the objects moved very slowly. They were midway across the sky when we first observed them, and they remained visible for about 20 seconds before passing out of our line of sight.  The first three objects were close together, almost in a formation, while the fourth was slightly behind and off center. They left a short smoky trail behind them, easily visible in the dark night sky. We've both seen many meteors, and this didn't conform with anything we've seen befor! e. Our first reaction was, What is that? The slow speed seemed to rule out a meteor or shooting star as did the strange color and the misty trail behind them. One final note, all the objects seemed to be travelling at the same rate of speed.;39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
Driving home in the evening headed east, I looked north out the van window and saw what apeered to be a rocket entering the atmosphere.;2003-02-16 20:15:00;6 sec.;Driving home in the evening headed east, I looked north out the van window and saw what apeered to be a rocket entering the atmosphere. I called to my wife to look and we looked at this shooting streek of light for a good 6 seconds. I proceeded to head to the Moutain terrain where it would be lost out of sight behind the moutains and clouds. I in a frantic state turn the radio to a news station in expectation of the begining of an attack from N. korea or somthing of this nature. To my suprise got nothing. When I got home called the police to report it, I was 1 of 2 in 20 mins. to report. I call the local news tv station and again was only 1 of 2. I belive it could be part of the space shuttle columbia. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded quite lucid and sober-minded.  He contacted Chico, CA, 9-1-1 facility immediately after his sighting.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport,   Thanks so much for the on going updates.  I spent some time since our submission visiting the Web site to familiarize myself with it.  You have a very interesting and tremendously challenging job!  I have a whole new awareness and appreciation of the job sorting out UFO's etc.  It definitely requires a certain personality, intelligence and integrity.   Our experience has definitely changed our life.  I always thought it was other people who saw those types of things (i.e. comets and things flying in the sky).  It felt really good to know that there are people that we could call after having that kind of experience. So you might pass it on to the powers that be that the arrangement that you have with the local authorities in our experience was a highly effective one from our perspective.   Best Wishes to you. Until next time????? ((END));39.7605553488372;-121.844666046512
A firey ball of light descending from left to right and high to low in front of us changed colors from white, to yellow to green.;2003-02-16 20:22:00;3-5 seconds;A firey ball of light descending from left to right and high to low in front of us changed colors from white, to yellow to green. My wife and I were traveling in our car in a north by northeast direction on Palmetto Ave. in central Chico at 8:22 PM PST (per the clock in the car). In a very surprising instant we both observed what appeared to be an astrological event in the eastern sky. A large, bright object that seemed to to me to be a fireball was descending rapidly from left to right starting at about 12 o'clock and disappearing at about 5 o'clock in our field of vision. The object basically followed a very slightly curved path approximately 30-40 degrees from a perpendicular line drawn from the horizon directly in front of us. The size of the object appeared 1/2-2/3 the size of the full moon overhead. It changed color while in view, from bright white to firey yellow to a brilliant iridescent blue/green. My first thought was that it was a large shooting star or meteor, but then I was shocked to see it change it's size (it become larger) and color. About half way through its descent it begin projecting a tapering trail as its color changed to bright yellow, almost as if there had been an explosion and acceleration in speed. The trail remained yellow as the object then took on a beautiful greenish-blue color just before it disappeared from view. It was not clear whether the object disappeared over the horizon or simply self-extinguished. I estimate the entire elapsed time of viewing was less than five seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Other reports from multiple points in the western U. S..  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to us to be exceptionally sober-minded, sincere, and credible.

I saw a bright blue/green fireball in the East/Northeast sky travel from left upper corner to the lower right horizon.;2003-02-16 20:22:00;5 seconds;I saw a bright blue/green fireball in the East/Northeast sky travel from left upper corner to the lower right horizon. I was traveling home for the evening with my husband down a road less than a half mile from my house that runs East/West in Chico.  It is a road that we travel frequently, if not daily, morning and night. We were traveling approximately 20-25 mph in a Toyota Rav4. While looking ahead (East) down the road and into the sky visible through the trees along the roadway, I saw a large ball of light appear in the upper left of my field of vision.  The ball was larger than I have ever seen in the sky.  I would estimate it to be approximately 1/2 - 2/3 the size of the full moon. My husband and I had just 5 minutes earlier been admiring the full moon and the moisture ring around it. As I watched the ball with a tail travel from the left of my field of vision to the right it appeared to fall or descend to the right lower corner of the field (approx. a 60 degree angle).  As the ball fell it appeared to change in color starting as a dark color (green/blue)with a small falling star like tail to mid frame/center adding a bright yellow back end/tail and a lighter blue/green body, and disappearing with much these same colors. I was so astonished by what I saw, I looked down at the clock in the car right then to note the specific time 20:22. My husband and I then began to talk about what we saw, and who or if we should report the information to.  I wish I knew what it was and where if at all it landed.
