Large Orb Expands, Then Vanishes;2006-07-21 22:00:00;30 seconds;Large Orb Expands, Then Vanishes I was sitting outside on a hot evening, looking at the sky towards the NNW. I noticed an object that appeared to be a large and bright star, similar to what Venus would look like at its brightest.  Within a few seconds, this object expanded, became bigger and even brighter, then suddenly disappeared. I watched the area for a while longer, but saw nothing re-appear, nothing else unusual.  This object never became unnaturally large or bright, but it was odd in that it increased in size before completely vanishing.;38.2828;-122.4677
