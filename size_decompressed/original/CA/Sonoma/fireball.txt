Fireball over the Sonoma Valley;2005-10-30 19:28:00;2 Sec.;Fireball over the Sonoma Valley It looked like a fireball shooting across the sky,    In my backyard with my dad, I went outside and was staring at the sky and all of a sudden this fireball looking object went over out house, from southwest to northeast, and I said dad come look at this, he came out into the backyard and by the time he looked up the object was gone, he thought I was making it up,  The object didn't look like a meteor, because a meteor is too hard to see with the naked eye, this you could actually see the tail on the object for about a second or two, It dissapeared out of sight,  Sonoma, CA is in a valley covered by hills and moutains, so it is hard to see objects sometimes because of it's low elevation, so after the object disapeared, it looked like it went behind the hills, most likley Northeast.;38.2828;-122.4677
RED FIREBALL OVER SONOMA;2006-07-15 00:03:00;7 MIN;RED FIREBALL OVER SONOMA THIS STAR-LIKE FIREBALL WAS BRIGHT RED AND 3 TIMES LARGER THAN THE LARGEST STAR IN THE SKY. IT WAS UNDER THE HANDLE OF THE BIG DIPPER AND STAYED STATIONARY FOR 4 MINUITES BEFORE DRIFTING TOWARD THE END OF THE DIPPER'S HANDLE. THERE WERE NO STROBE LIGHTS OR RUNNING LIGHTS, SO IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE. AFTER IT BEGAN TO DRIFT IR DID A SUDDEN ZIG-ZAG, ZIG-ZAG, ZIG, AND THEN VANISHED ABRUPTLY. THE TIME WAS 00:10.  I SAW THIS FROM THE PARKING LOT BEHIND KSVY RADIO STATION IN DOWNTOWN SONOMA AS I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE AFTER DOING MY SHOW STRANGE WINE (HISTORY AND THE PARANORMAL IN THE VALLEY OF THE MOON. I OFTEN TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE HIGH RATE OF UFO SIGHTINGS IN SONOMA WHEN I DO MY GHOSTS & LEGENDS OF SONOMA TOURS IN MY LIMOUSINE. I HAVE SEEN THE BIG BLACK TRIANGLES EARLY IN THE MORNING, THE LITTLE LIGHTS THAT DO FORMATION EXERCISES, EVEN THE ONES THAT HIDE IN FRONT OF STARS, BUT NEVER A RED ONE LIKE THIS BEFORE!;38.2828;-122.4677
very bright orange/amber light moves, freezes, no noise not in usual air trafic path about 10 min.;2006-07-29 03:00:00;10 min. approx.;very bright orange/amber light moves, freezes, no noise not in usual air trafic path about 10 min. My co-workers(night grocery clerks) and I witnessed a bright orange/amber light. It moved from north west to south east. It was about 45 degrees above the horizon. This orange light was so bright, it looked like the orange street lights around our location, but this object was 5 to 10 miles away and moving quite slowly. Its speed changed gradually and it also froze for 20 or so seconds-about 3 times. It paralleled the eastern horizon in a very shallow S pattern. It seemed to stay under the marine layer of fog for the first half of its passing, then it was only blurred and less bright. I have taken my lunch break in the same spot for 7+ years. I have tracked iridium satellites, and watched the air traffic in the same location as this fireball-five days a week. I am very aware of the sky and it's changes-I can only tell you what it wasn't. Also, it made no noise what so ever. The most similar object I can come up with is a naval flare, but the color is wrong, there were no sparks, no tail, and the trajectory is all wrong, not to mention the over all distance it traveled.;38.2828;-122.4677

We pulled over to look at them and watched as they slowly disappeared one by one.;38.2828;-122.4677
