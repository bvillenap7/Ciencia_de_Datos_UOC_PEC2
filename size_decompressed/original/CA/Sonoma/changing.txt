Orange orb.;2016-06-11 21:50:00;2 minutes;Orange orb. June 11, 2016.  9:50 pm  Sonoma Ca. After taking my mother home, my wife and I were walking out to the car in Moon Valley Park Sonoma, when I looked up and saw an orange orb in the sky.  My wife got her phone out of her purse and started shooting pictures. We watched as it was slowly coming toward us, then it changed course to its left then started to fade out you could still see a faint point of light making circles started to grow again in size and looked like a faint grey smudge and began to fall looking like a jellyfish all the way down to the ground about 100 yards away, I got a real good look at it low to the ground it was almost transparent ghostly.  We looked for it but found nothing.  I went back to the spot next day and did not find anything. It look to be maybe 4 to 6 feet in size down near the ground and judging by that I would put it about 150 to 200 feet in the air before it came down.;38.2828;-122.4677
