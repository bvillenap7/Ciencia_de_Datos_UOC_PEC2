3 groups of 6-10 blue points of light appeared traveling NE at high altitude.;2014-07-04 21:27:00;2 minutes;3 groups of 6-10 blue points of light appeared traveling NE at high altitude. Long Description of Sighting Report:   We were near Sonoma Square waiting with several thousand people for the 9:30 fireworks.  Several minutes before the fireworks started, a kid pointed straight up with his arm and said something like Hey, a blue ufo!  Most people who heard him (he yelled pretty loud) looked up and we saw a small, far away group of 6-10 faint starlike objects.  The group was traveling NE at about the same speed as the international space station. It approached the moon and disappeared. I was willing to assume it was the ISS. Then, another group appeared in the SW and followed the same NE path and disappeared near the moon, too.  That eliminated the ISS. Then a 3rd faint group appeared in about the same place in the SW, traveled near the moon, made a 270 degree turn to the west, went a short distance and disappeared.  That really eliminated the ISS. What was interesting was the path of the groups.  The path was not a perfectly straight line, it was a series of distinct course changes. At least 40 people that were sitting by us saw and many commented on them. There were probably 4000 people sitting on the field, facing South, all looking up in the sky for the first fireworks when these objects appeared. Expect more reports. I am a pilot and used to flying at night - and they def weren't meteors, airplanes, satellites, fireworks.;38.2828;-122.4677
8 orbs flying over Sonoma.;2017-03-29 21:00:00;10 seconds;8 orbs flying over Sonoma I was laying outside staring up at the sky, and noticed cloud cover coming in blocking out the stars.  After 10 minutes it started to clear and I noticed 8 white orbs, with the color of the brightest star in the visible sky.  They flew in formation, flying south to north at low altitude. 10-15000 feet.  They were flying 500-600 mph and there wasn't any sound, no indicator lights aircraft have, and no contrails.

20 orange spots of light.;2018-03-26 20:10:00;3 minutes;Group of up to around 20 orange spots of light.  Looking Southeast.  Travelling slowly in same direction at first, but varying distances between them, then some reversing direction, then reducing in number to around 5, then all disappearing.  Not moving at all like a helo or jet.  Could not gauge altitude or speed but no reports from ATC.;38.2828;-122.4677
V formation of lights, moving south to north, VERY FAST,  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-22 01:40:00;4-7 seconds;V formation of lights, moving south to north, VERY FAST, faster than anything man made, totally silent, changed formation in air. At approximately 1:40 A.M. PST I was looking at the constellation Orion when I noticed movement. It took 1 second for my eyes to focus but and before they had done so I assumed satellite.  Once my eyes focused, I saw 5 small dull lights in a V formation moving extremely fast from south to north.  As the object passed over me the 5 lights seemed to be in such a formation that I immediately thought stealth bomber at a relatively low altitude. This was odd cause my initial thought was that this object was far away.  As I was thinking this the 5 lights seemed to spread out then get close together before totally shifting formation in the air. At this point the object had traversed most of the sky and I realized that the formation and distance changed between the dull lights indicating that this was not 1 object but 5. As I was struggling to comprehend this object they got brighter and another one appeared. They did not get very bright. It was almost as if light was ! being reflected off them due to their angle and for a spilt second I thought they could be birds, snow geese in particular. As I thought this they lost that light got in a tighter formation and accelerated away. -I have never seen anything move this fast -The shifting of formation and changes in distance between the lights was unique -Object was completely silent -Altitude and distance was hard to gauge;38.2828;-122.4677
