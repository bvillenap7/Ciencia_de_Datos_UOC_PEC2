I dismissed it as that while I was changing a headlight on my car.   After a minute or so I noticed that it never moved.  I stopped to stare at it thinking that I was witnessing a rare sighting of Mars but realized Mars is not in tonights sky...then the object ascended extremely rapidly AND moved further South and remained stationary.   This grabbed my attention and astonishment!   Then the red pulsating light began to emit more white light as bright as a searchligh on a helicopter from far away.  Then the object shifted rapidly to the West and remained stationary.  Then I knew I was seeing a UFO...while looking at it and trying to yell for my wife I saw red droplets fall from the object...these tiny droplets were redder than any flare...similar to the red plastic color of a tail light lens...the red tear drops dimmed and then were extingushed.  The speed that these droplets fell was abnormal, the color was abnormal, and what could this be?   I finally ran inside to grab my wife who was too slow to come outside and of course the object was gone.   I find it hard to believe that I was the only one who witnessed this...please come forward.  I have seen several UFO's in my life while camping and fishing in remote area's and have several witnesses to other events.  This time I am posting it.  My background: Father and husband --thirty years old...I do not drink and I do not take any medications or drugs.  I am college educated and a sales man in the Bay Area.;38.2828;-122.4677

Pulsating floating red orb flies over home.;2014-08-04 22:30:00;5:00 minutes;Pulsating floating red orb flies over home. I was not the first one to see this light object.  My mother went outside to hang some clothes when I heard her call me out.  She was calling me in a hurried manor.  I went outside just in time to see this orb floating directly above trees in our backyard and it floated over our home. We watched it together for close to 5 minutes as it slowly floated by. It was an orange/red color.  Pulsating from low brightness to high brightness.  If I had to compare it to something it'd have to be like how a flare would look. The orb came up low over trees in our back yard, flew over our home and ascended into the dark sky.  We watched it for about 5 mins before we couldn't see it anymore.  There were planes in the area flying above.  Our dog was with us as we stood out watching and it whimpered as if frightened.  It may be due to the light orb.;38.2828;-122.4677
A powerful blue beam of light 20-30 miles long at least with a very slow rotation.

I walked outside and saw a long blue light at least 20 to 30 miles long unlike anything I have ever seen.  I appeared to be coming from the sky and rotated very slowly.  This light was definitely not the type you'd see from a movie premiere.   My mom who is not a believer in anything extraterrestrial was shocked and amazed and without words.;38.2828;-122.4677
Very bright orange planet like light, sphere, with slight tail and tiny red light near the tail, slowly moving East.;2017-06-29 21:50:00;2 minutes;Very bright orange planet like light, sphere, with slight tail and tiny red light near the tail, slowly moving East. Very bright orange planet like light with slight orange tail in the North, North-West sky noticed high in the sky at 9:50 pm.  I watched the object for 30 seconds or so and noticed it was moving very slowly East.  A tiny red light was visible from the tail area.  It was brighter than all other stars or planets, and 50% bigger than Venus.  Did not look like the space station, which is smaller, moves much, much faster and which appears closer to earth.  Went inside to grab camera and binoculars, light was still there, but began to slowly fade away.   Red light plus slight shadow of a solid object were the last parts to be seen.  We have quite a bit of air traffic in the area, and this looked nothing like an aircraft.;38.2828;-122.4677
Bright orange light flying and then hovering in the sky.;2017-06-29 22:00:00;3 minutes;Bright orange light flying and then hovering in the sky At 10 pm, while taking out the garbage, I looked up at the sky and saw a curiously bright orange light approaching from the southwest.   I ran inside to get my wife, and we both observed the light for a couple of minutes.  We saw it slow down, change direction, and hover in the sky.   It appeared to be at a higher altitude than any recreational drones I’ve ever seen, its movements were definitely not consistent with those of an airplane, and we did not hear any helicopter or aircraft sounds.  It had a fiery, and slightly flickery or pulsing, orange glow and didn’t seem to have any blinking lights like a traditional aircraft.   While it was hovering, I took a short, blurry cellphone video, then I ran in the house for five seconds or so to get a better camera.  When I returned, it had vanished.;38.2828;-122.4677

Far above The ufos were are trailing behind each other very closely and moving at an incredible speed and dissipated or disappeared within minutes in clear night sky. A couple minutes more and a 9th round light moving similar direction trailing behind and disappeared a bit sooner then the prior 8 ufos. It was near the Big Dipper in the sky.;38.2828;-122.4677
