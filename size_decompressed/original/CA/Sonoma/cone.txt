Obj. possibly cyl. or cone, with a dark red tail approx. 4-6 lengths of the obj.  ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.  PD));2015-12-22 18:05:00;1.5 minutes;The object was possibly cylindrical or cone shaped with a dark red tail approx 4-6 lengths of the object.  It appeared to be heading directly south/south east in a straight line coming from the north, did not appear to loose or gain altitude.  The tail may have been propelling the object as it did not appear to change shape, color.  It did not appear to loose momentum.   I first saw the object pass by heading sounth, I watch it approx 10 seconds before calling for family members inside home to come see.  10-15 seconds before they come out side and we watched object heading south for approx another 30 seconds.  It breifly disappeared in cloud cover then reappeared before finally loosing sight of it over San Francisco/Oakland area. ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.  PD));38.2828;-122.4677
