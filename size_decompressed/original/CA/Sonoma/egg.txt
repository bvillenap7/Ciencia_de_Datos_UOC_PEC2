Large unidentified craft observed in the Napa sloughs.;2010-02-26 14:00:00;30 min.;Large unidentified craft observed in the Napa sloughs. We were in a boat in the sloughs. Midway between the Napa River and Sonoma Creek when we saw a craft standing in a salt pond.  We had just passed the area in which the craft was aproximately 30 minutes prior and the craft was not there when we passed by the location. We were aproximately 4tenths of a mile from it. It stood aproximately 50 ft. high and 40 ft. wide.  It had what I call legs extending out from the sides aproximately 3 ft. from the body of the craft starting aprox.10 ft. from the top to the bottom. We couldn't see the bottom because it was on the other side of the levy. We were amazed and starred at it for a few minutes. We talked about a camera. We had problems with the boat motor as it failed to start.  Somehow we lossed our memory of what happened from the time we saw the craft to the time we were back at the Hudeman slough boat ramp.  We would have seen it as we passed by the spot at the levy when we headed back to the ramp.  My brother and I both feel as if an energy source could have taken our concentration etc and over powered us after we seen the craft. We haven't talked about this to anybody since as we both agree people will say we are crazy, were on drugs or some other comments.  After I listenen to coast to coast on the am channel the other morning, I thought I would share this sighting.  I have a very hard time believing that we were the only ones who saw this craft. It stood out in an area with no trees, buildings or structures at all in the area.  I have never seen a craft similar to this in my life other than one on a science fiction movie maby.  We are very curious as to wether or not a similar report has been made.  If you have indeed received a similar report of a similar object I would appreciate you getting back to me.;38.2828;-122.4677
