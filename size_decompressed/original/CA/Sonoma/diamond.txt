I was out back smoking a cigarette and looking at the orange 1/2 moon, clear skys, semi bright(do to the moons glow)some visible stars.  Out of the corner of my eye heading heading in a North western direction moving pretty fast and steady I saw these lights, flickering Red, Blue, White, Yellow. At first it looked like it was flying toward the moon, I thought maybe it was an airplane, but no noise, and lights where blinking to fast. Then I thought what is that? How weird? so I ran in side and got my binoculars and ran out the front door, and caught site of it again, a lot father away, foggy image through binoculars, looked diamond shaped small flickering colors. then it was out of sight moving so fast. Then coming the other direction I saw much closer an airplane flying toward the south, red and blue flickering lights, but much slower. and could definately make out the shape of an airplane. What was that other thing, it was going pretty fast?;38.2828;-122.4677
