V shaped sighting in Sonoma;2008-04-26 20:35:00;30 seconds;V shaped sighting in Sonoma Something appeared to me when I was looking at the stars. It came from the east,hovered directly above me about 4-5 seconds and shot off to the west at tremendous speed. It could have been mistaken for a flock of geese in formation-w/ the sun hitting them. But there was NO SUN @ 9:30 PST,& geese don't fly at SST speed.  It was a group of small(to my eye-who knows how high it was) pale orange glowing chevron shapes that formed a triangle. It was a very dim light-I would have missed it if I would have blinked. There was the outline of the triangle-maybe 6-8 chevrons on each side and 4-5 inside lined up. The point of the triangle was west-the direction it went. All of the chevrons moved together. It made a very slight VVV sound before it shot off to the west. Only a second or so.  The whole thing happened so fast, I have been second guessing myself-and trying to come up w/ a logical idea, to no avail. Hope that you have heard of this type of craft.

UFO spotting in Nothern California;2011-09-28 22:15:00;7 seconds;UFO spotting in Nothern California Me and my friends were hanging out front of there home in Sonoma, Ca, as one of them spotted a unidentified flying object.  He wasn't thee only one that saw this object, a few of us did.  It was a perfectly clear warm night.  We know for sure that it wasn't an airplane,helicopter, or satellite.  What we saw looked like a Triangular object with more then a few very unnoticeable lights on the bottom, and made no noise.  This is the second time that we've seen this object, the last time was a few years ago heading in the same direction, north.   We saw it for a few seconds and lost sight as it continued north, over homes.  Please get back to me as soon as possible, thank you.;38.2828;-122.4677
