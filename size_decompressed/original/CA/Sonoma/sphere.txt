Round, metallic-looking sphere over my house;2015-12-18 13:00:00;2 minutes;Round, metallic-looking sphere over my house It was a bright, clear day in December 2015, about 60 degrees and sunny, and I went out to get some firewood. I happened to look up and there was a round (spherical), bronze-colored craft sitting stationary over my house. It had a metallic looking appearance and on the side that I was looking at it looked to me like there were part concave or convex areas to it.  I was looking at it facing north, looking up over my house. There were no propellers, so it could not have been a drone, and no sound.  It was approximately 300 ft. above my house and if I were to estimate width, I would say maybe  20 to 30 feet wide. I was the only witness and I watched it for about 1 to 2 minutes.  Here is another additional part to my story. I have followed the UFO media reports for quite a few years and always thought  that  it would be great  to see one, to validate for myself that they exist.  I would get my camera, get a witness,  document everything, etc. After watching the craft, I continued on out to the wood pile and got the logs for my fireplace, and forgot about the entire thing… I remembered about 3 ½  weeks later, into January of this year , about  witnessing the craft. I am totally perplexed about that part of my story. I am a 62 year old woman with grandkids, have run a business for many years, and  have lived here for 28 years.  There would be no reason for me to fabricate this event.  As to who was piloting it -  ??;38.2828;-122.4677
