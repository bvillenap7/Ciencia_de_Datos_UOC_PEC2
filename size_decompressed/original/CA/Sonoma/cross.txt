It had a blue light near center, the core was a vertical white light and the glow was star like off all edges, like fingers, not the normal star nor was it an obvious aircraft because of it not moving for such an extended period of time, and it appeared too large for an aircraft, and  it was west of us here in Sonoma, it looked like it was over the town of Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa area.   It was huge and the bright lights both blue and white were something to see extending so far out of the core.  It hoverred and the lights went from extremely bright to nearly dissappearing and back again.  The glow made it nearly impossible to be an airplane and was deffinately not a hellicopter.  What was it??  It eventually disappeared and hasnâ€™t returned as I did go out to look just now. 23:02.;38.2828;-122.4677
