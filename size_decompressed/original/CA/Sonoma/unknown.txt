Strange light stationary in the sky.;2014-03-12 06:25:00;2 hours;Strange light stationary in the sky. I stayed at a friend’s house on the evening of March 11.  We looked at the constellations, but did not see anything unusual. The next morning, as I was leaving, my friend looked in the sky and asked “is that a UFO?”.  It was a very bright light in the sky, too low to be a star. I left to return to my home in San Rafael CA.  The light was stationary for the entire duration of the trip (about 30 minutes).  It just hovered in the same spot. By the time I arrived home, it was just past dawn. The light was still there.  I grabbed a pair of binoculars. Peering through them, I could see it was several lights on the one object.  I could not make out the shape. I went inside to make breakfast, shower, and get ready for work.  I got out of the shower, went outside, and the object was gone.;38.2828;-122.4677
