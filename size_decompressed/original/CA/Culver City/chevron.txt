It was flying north to northwest. I looked again because normally the planes don't fly that direction . Planes   have red white and blue lights and only three.  It moved very slow and again what struck me as odd was there was no sound what so ever.  You could see the pattern of lights three on each side and 2 sets of 2 in between that.  It just slowly went on it's way but I didn't continue to watch so I am not sure what happened.  I have never seen anything like this object or its size which was possibly twice as large as a jet plane and it was flying at a higher altitude (not much higher) then the planes from lax..;34.0022728571429;-118.398645142857
I noticed a very faint grey/black colored triangular object flying above me.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-12 19:55:00;2 minutes;On Friday night, I was looking up at the stars with a friend.  When I noticed a very faint grey/black colored triangular object flying above me.  All I could see were the chevron type wings with really dimly lit lights in uniform pattern.  It seemed to be very large and was flying low, and lasted only a couple seconds.  All of a sudden in jus disappeared into the clouds?  It was by far the most bizarre thing I have ever seen flying in the sky.  I actually had no clue what I had saw except that it wasnâ€™t an airline aircraft by any means!.  I now believe in UFOs after the sighting! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.0022728571429;-118.398645142857
