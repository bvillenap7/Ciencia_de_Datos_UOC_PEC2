SILVERY OBJECT SEEN HOVERING HIGH-ALTITUDE OVER CULVER CITY, CALIFORNIA;2005-10-05 18:00:00;2 hours;SILVERY OBJECT SEEN HOVERING HIGH-ALTITUDE OVER CULVER CITY, CALIFORNIA While filming the motion picture Click at Sony Studios in Culver City, CA, several eye witnesses (including myself) (all witnesses were Union and Non-Union Background Actors, Sony Studios employees, and crew members of various motion picture and television series productions) seen a metallic object in the sky. The conditions that day were clear/blue skied/sunny. The object hovered over the studios about 25,000-30,000 feet. A military-type aircraft also flying high-altitude, flew past this object. The object did not move for more than two (2) hours. Finally, all eyewitnesses were asked to proceed inside Studio 26 to perform with several Hollywood personalities. The object was silvery and shiny...as the sun reflected this object to be seen by many of the eyewitnesses. I did not initially spot this object. I was asked to go outside by another person to observe this object. I have no idea if this object was reported by another eyewitness and/or if a report was filed. Because we were on location at Sony Studios, there was NO record of any filming relating to or concerning aircraft or aerospace films--especially at the altitude of this object.
