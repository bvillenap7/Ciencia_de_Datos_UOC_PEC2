Star like objects moving irregularly;1999-07-04 21:00:00;ongoing;Star like objects moving irregularly On the 4th of July 1999 I was at Culver City park to observe the fireworks, before they started I was Looking through my binoculars at the stars in the sky when in the heavens as if theywere stars and looking just like stars I observed about 5 to 6 stars moving in odd directions,	moving forward backward sideways and in circular motions around a slightly larger star they were blinking or flashing brightly as if communicating with each other and the larger star. This went on for at least an hour while I watched them instead of the fireworks, I began to feel as if someone or something was watching me wether it was up in the sky or in the park on the ground, it gave me the creeps and I got me and my kids out of there just as soon as I could. I dont know if anyone has seen lights, stars, ufos like these but it was real and surreal.;34.0022728571429;-118.398645142857
