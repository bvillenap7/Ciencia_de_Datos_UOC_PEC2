dull orange/red spinning circle of Los Angeles area;2006-10-29 17:50:00;3 minutes;Dull orange/red spinning circle of Los Angeles area My friend and I saw an object in the sky moving rapidly from West to East outside my house in Culver City.   There were no lights and no noise trail was left by the craft.   The craft was dull redish/orange, circular and spinning.   We could not figure out what it was.   It appeared to be high up in the sky - higher than a plane would go. ((NUFORC Note:  Another report of a similar object at 18:10 hrs. near Cameron City, CA.  Please see report.  Date was corrected by witness.  Event occurred on Sunday night, October 29, 2006.  PD));34.0022728571429;-118.398645142857
