We witnessed a green light (occasional red light on right) flying up slowly in the western sky (near Marina del Rey).   The light stopped, then veered to the right, stopped, then left and back down, etc... for approximately 8 minutes, then shot up into the sky until we couldn't see it anymore (cloudy night).  Then, approximately 3 minutes later it reappeared further south in the sky, did similar movements, then dropped out of sight towards the Earth (trees got in the way and we couldn't see it anymore).  Perhaps it was a coast guard helicopter maybe?  Appeared far too high and too bright to be a remote-controlled craft.  Too cloudy to have been a satellite I think and definitely didn't move like any airplane I've ever read about.;34.0022728571429;-118.398645142857
