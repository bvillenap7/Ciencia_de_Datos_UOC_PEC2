The objects had no lights on but appeared to be a very light brown/tan in color with a subtle glow around each of them.  At first I thought they might be birds- but in the short seconds I caught them flying overhead, I noticed one seemed to disappear then reappear, and I also noticed that one or two of them flipped themselves around once in a circle while still staying in the formation. Also, the crafts appeared very defined- I was not able to make out a definitive shape, but was able to make out that they were some kind of intricate vessels with lines indicating either beveled edges or some kind of craftsmanship.  I would estimate they were moving at a speed of about 150 miles an hour or more,  It's hard to estimate exactly but they were moving very fast.  I had dropped my laundry and tried to follow where they were headed- the most I could see was that they were heading south towards Inglewood/South Central.  By the time I pulled out my phone to video it, it was too late and I thought it was a once in a lifetime chance I couldn't miss a second of.  My phone froze when I got inside and tried to call/message people. About a minute later a helicopter flew overhead in the same general direction- there was no way it would've been able to catch them.
