Age 46, I am a retail business owner (16 years) (Very) Amateur astronomer. Always looking up.;34.0022728571429;-118.398645142857
Very bright light, approx altitude 50,000 feet, moving SSE direction at steep upward angle.;2000-04-19 20:20:00;1min 30 sec;Very bright light, approx altitude 50,000 feet, moving SSE direction at steep upward angle. Noticed a very bright light almost directly east with azimuth about 80 degrees. Object at first appeared to be very bright misplaced planet or star (more like a planet), then started moving! I guestimate altitude at about 50,000 + feet, rapidly headed upward with slight South-South-Easterly direction. As it continued up, light became dimmer rapidly, almost as though there was a spotlight pointed down at me and it was slowly rotated towards the horizon as it travelled up. No sounds were audible. We live in the flight path of planes leaving LAX, this was NOT a regular flight plan, or holding pattern around the airport. The altitude was VERY high. This did not appear to be anything I've seen from Edwards AFB (close by). There was no visible exhaust trail of any kind. The sky was clear and without clouds and only slightly hazy (it had just rained within the last day). After exclaiming this to my girlfriend, she says she saw two similar objects approximately two weeks earlier, but didn't mention it at the time, therefore we have no date or time to report, other than it was in the early evening, after dark. She saw two separate objects a minute or two apart, both travelled in the same direction. She witnessed no dimming of the light, but the objects travelled a short distance before disappearing. She describes them as looking like moving stars that just disappeared from the sky. Not sure if these were even UFOs, but would like some possible explanation.;34.0022728571429;-118.398645142857

It had no running lights just a constant light like a star. It Moved from Northeast to Southwest.;34.0022728571429;-118.398645142857
Blue light.;2014-10-12 21:00:00;1 minute;I was on the porch with my brother, when he pointed out a deep blue light in the sky.  It moved diagonally down to the left and we watched for a few seconds.   I ran to the backyard to where my girlfriend was to show her.  We watched it change directions, the swiftly move behind a house, out of our sight.;34.0022728571429;-118.398645142857
Singular red light.;2014-12-28 20:58:00;1 second;Singular  red light I was in my car on my way way home from work.  As I turned right onto my street I noticed a red light to the west in the sky. It disappeared within a few seconds.  I continued to look where the light came from, thinking it might be a blinking plane, but it did not reappear...;34.0022728571429;-118.398645142857
