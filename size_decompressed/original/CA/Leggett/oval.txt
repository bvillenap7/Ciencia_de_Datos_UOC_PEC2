It was like it was taking pictures. A friend of mine told me that her and two members of her family had seen  something flashing in the sky and that it flashed but never moved. I went to the location that they mentioned a couple of times after they called but never seen anything so I decided that I would go out and look in the direction that she pointed out then a few weeks went by but  eventually on December 18, 2009 I witnessed a big bright pure white flash. I looked at it and I seen a light go up into some kind of compartment as it was about half way up the object it reflected light onto itself and I could see an oval shape and I could see where it looked like the light might stop then it did stop there and then I could not see it anymore.  The first thing one may think of if they see this object flash is that a picture was taken. I am still watching out for it here when weather permit's.;39.8515;-123.6613
