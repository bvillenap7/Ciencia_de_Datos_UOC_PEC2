It appeared to be floating around a small area and they suddenly faded away. There was not any blinking lights or noise from the object while it was in the sky or after it faded away.

As I kept driving intially I discounted it as maybe stray car light behind us from a distance.  I checked the mirror to look for a car behind me and saw nothing.  I looked over again and I saw something with three bright lights follwing my car and I got scared because what ever it was followed us up to the subdivision I live.  What ever it was kept up its speed with my car and seemed to float with no sound coming from it.  I was getting really worried because we thought it was coming after us.  As soon as it approached where all the house are it took off out of sight. This is the second time I have seen weird activity in this area.
