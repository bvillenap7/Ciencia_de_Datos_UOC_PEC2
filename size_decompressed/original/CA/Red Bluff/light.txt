Regular appearence of straight traveling lights;2006-12-31 18:52:00;3 to 4 minutes;Regular appearence of straight traveling lights Hello, These  lights have been coming around here for years on end, but for the last few years the lights have been coming over much lower then usual. In this past week of December 26th, 2006, at 6:52 PM and December 31, 2006 at 6:52 PM same time again, these  Golden ball lights with no sound with no other lights came over My area at about 5 miles out at about 5,000 feet from a west to east direction over the North part of the City of  Red Bluff, California. These lights came over while aircraft traffic was in the area at the same time. I know these aircraft seen these lights and the light on December 31, 2006, because one aircraft on the December 31, 2006 at 6:52 PM made a turn towards the light,I am sure it was  to see the Golden ball of light better. The aircraft was a signal prop engine aircraft, civilian because I could hear that it was a ,possible Cesna Type aircraft.  The aircraft was at the  same altituded and a half a mile if not close from the object. The golden ball light was biger then the aircraft's lights brcause if the aircraft had gone into the light or passed behind it You would not see the aircrafts lights at all. I and two witnesses watched it as it went  over the City of Red Bluff, California the light just went out in front of our eyes.;40.1811;-122.2359
