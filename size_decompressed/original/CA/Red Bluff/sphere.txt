Two Orange Orbs/UFO flying by Red Bluff, CA.;2011-05-11 03:35:00;10 - 15 SECONDS;Two Orange Orbs/UFO flying by Red Bluff, CA. I am working graveyard shift this morning, and I clocked out for lunch Approx 03:15 am.  I did my daily walk around work, and I found a nice quite & dark place to lay on the pavement so that I may gaze at the stars.  Well it was pretty hazy/cloudy up in the sky, with clouds rolling in from the West.  These were the type of Clouds that are very ripply, the ones that have been reported as Haarp Generated.  Although it was some what cloudy I could still se stars.   After awhile of gazing, all of a sudden two dim orange objects drifted over my head, going from North to South.  They looked to be in the clouds or above them because they were pretty blurry.  They were probably about 300 feet apart.  (Itâ€™s hard to tell being on the ground but that would be my guess)  They were both traveling at the very same speed, which was faster than your normal airplane or jet.  They had no blinking lights and no noise.  One of the Orbs seemed to be rocking back and forth coming closer to the other and then back away.  They did not take off super fast and disappear like most UFO sightings, they just kept on drifting by at a steady speed until I could no longer see them.;40.1811;-122.2359
