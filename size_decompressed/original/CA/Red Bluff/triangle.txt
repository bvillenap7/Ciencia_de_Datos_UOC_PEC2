Triangular, possible aura, definately morphed shape.;2004-03-18 18:32:00;1 minute;Triangular, possible aura, definately morphed shape. My doubting husband called me out to the patio.....6:32pm.........he was looking to the northwest., asked me What is That?  I said a cloud piece, but as I looked, it was triangular, although to me it seemed somewhat transparent, with a solid black speck on the left of it.  We both saw it change shape and disappear. No time to grab camera.  Hopefully someone saw it for a longer period than we did.  It was very far off and low in the sky from our perspective.;40.1811;-122.2359
