Observed oval shaped object in the sky.;2019-09-21 12:35:00;30 seconds;Observed oval shaped object in the sky. Was driving in hogsback road looking for locations to do some night photography. Stopped at a location to take a test shot with my phone... the object appeared or caught my eye as I was shooting the picture... went back to my jeep to get my camera with telephoto lens, keeping my eye on it the entire time, about 20 seconds  opened door and grabbed my camera taking my eyes off for approx 10 seconds when I turned around it was gone.  There was no sound coming from it, it was approximately 1/4-1/2 mile from me.  It appeared to be between 10-20 feet across and shiny...;40.1811;-122.2359
