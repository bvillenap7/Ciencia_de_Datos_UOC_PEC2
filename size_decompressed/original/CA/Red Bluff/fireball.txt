PD)) We were driving south on Interstate 5 when we witnessed it.  Other cars were pulling off the road also, to observe. At first it looked like a comet with a long bright white tail, then the tail increased in length and even more it widened at to at least 20 times the original size.  The head then moved forward and let out a second burst of tail in front of the first.  Then the head seemed to explode and disappear.  The tails remained visible for a long time (many minutes)after.  As the tails faded they were replaced by a flourescent aqua blue glow. There were 4 in our car one retired firefighter, one hospital department director, two college students.  One person stopped alongside us was an seismic activity researcher, we didn't get his name but his license plate was from Oregon ((license deleted)).;40.1811;-122.2359
Orange fireball emitting smoke with bright white light, while hovering and spinning.;2014-09-12 06:00:00;1 minute;Orange fireball emitting smoke with bright white light, while hovering and spinning. I was outside smoking, when I noticed a orange light floating north closer to town.  It suddenly stopped in mid air, the orange faded to white, and became very bright.   It looked like it started spinning while releasing some kind of mist or smoke.  I think it was spinning because the bright white light kept highlighting the smoke/mist.   While still letting off the must it started moving west.  Then its lights went out, smoke stopped and it was gone.   This happened right before dawn and I was able to watch few a few seconds till I couldn't see it anymore.   I tried to get video but happened too fast.  I've never seen anything like this, and it did blow my mind.  There was no sound either just a strange fireball looking light.;40.1811;-122.2359
