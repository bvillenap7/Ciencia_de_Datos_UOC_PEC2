Flash lighting entire skyline;2005-09-24 19:35:00;3 seconds;Flash lighting entire skyline Wife and I were driving eastbound on State highway 36 about 15 miles east of Red Bluff, Ca. when we saw a flash that lit up the entire eastern skyline.  We could see Mt Lassen and Turner Mt. in silhouette by the event that lasted for approx. 3 seconds with a slight strobe effect.  Sky conditions were clear and cloudless.;40.1811;-122.2359
