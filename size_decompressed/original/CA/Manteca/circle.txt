Me and four other friends sighted an orange ball that flickered in and out for about five minutes. The ball moved in all directions, as well as stood still for long periods of time, before making a decent (what had to be less then a few hundred feet), and disappearing. NO other colored lights were seen on the object, and it stood out considerably as the brightest thing in the sky.;37.7944444444444;-121.222355555555
