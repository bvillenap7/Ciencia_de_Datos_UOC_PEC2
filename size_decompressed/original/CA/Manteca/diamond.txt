Fast enough to ask the question, Did you just see that    I asked my friends if they could draw what they saw and i asked not to show them until everybody was done and the results were very exact, everyone drew a somewhat (diamond shape) that only concluded that we all saw something of the same shape now was it a Drone?,   Military or otherwise we couldn't tell you but we all did see Something!!

There was no noise of any type of motor and they glided side by side.  We watched for about 15-20 seconds.   As they got further the light disappeared, going towards Oakdale.  We were in shock, trying to figure out what itvwsd.  So we sat in backyard yelling to our neighbors.   About 10 minutes after,  we see ano ther pair same exact  and same color.  We captured video on cell phone of the two smooth gliding objects.  These two were also headed toward Oakdale.   What a sight to see.  It's making us believers that UFO exist.;37.7944444444444;-121.222355555555
