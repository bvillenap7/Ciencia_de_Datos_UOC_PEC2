blue belly: ship with blue light outlineing the bottom of saucer, white ball of light on each end. top: one white ball of light on  top;1979-06-15 19:00:00;3 seconds;blue belly: ship with blue light outlineing the bottom of saucer, white ball of light on each end. top: one white ball of light on  top blue belly:i have seen a ship, it had a blue curved linea lighted line (the color of blue chalk on a chalk board) on the bottom of what appeared to be a disk shaped vehicle. on the front and back end, it had a small ball of white light, and on the top was a slightly bigger ball of white light. there was no noise at all.                     one night around 1978-1980, i was sitting on my porch with my 2 yr old nephew, and my small terrier dog was on my lap. i was around 12yrs old.    my dog became incredibly nervous, so i put her in the house. (my memory of the date is terrible, but remembering the incident is extremely vivid) approximately 5 min. later, after the dog was put in, i saw the blue belly enter the sky to my left, it seemed as if it had slowed down for a minute. it moved around 8-10 miles (from Tracy to French Camp) at a speed of (estimate:10,000 mph) for almost 1-2 seconds, then took off(probably way over 15,000 mph)towards tahoe for a visable 1 second.then it seemed to cut into the sky and disapeared. it left a bluish vapor trail.(i must say, the haunting image i can never forget was:like seeing god it was so beautiful, sacred,and graceful and there's nothing like seeing advanced technology in action:it's awsome! ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  We have arbitrarily assigned a date in 1979 so that the case sorts to that date.  PD));37.7944444444444;-121.222355555555

Chirstmas eve 2006 sighting in Manteca California 3:35am.;2006-12-24 03:30:00;45 minutes;Chirstmas eve 2006 sighting in Manteca California 3:35am. Very foggy night, We viewed the craft with bonoculuers. One craft was seen spining disk shape about six to eight thousand miles up and about five mile from our home. Viewed the object from the open bathroom window, blinking red and blue lights some green light, more blinking red with a brighter white light.  The object hovered in one place for about 15 minutes and then moved very slowly downward about 1,000 feet and then slowly moved westward about 5 miles.  After about another 15 minutes the object lights went on and off. Then the craft turned into a round Mars shape teal light blue object round with a oval shape, resembling a metalic texture. The craft moved at a faster speed moving to the west and then blinked out.  As the fog got thicker the craft went farther or the lights just went out completley.  Witnesses were ((father))  years old, ((mother)) years, ((son)) years.  You could not see any stars or moon because of the very thick fog, just the object, which seemed to be very large in size and the object seem to stay staionary for most of the time.  The object seem to be waiting or looking at something.;37.7944444444444;-121.222355555555
