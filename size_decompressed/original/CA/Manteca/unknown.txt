big blob of blinking rainbow lights;2008-09-06 01:57:00;10 min;big blob of blinking rainbow lights I was looking out my window while laying in bed and i seen something strange out of the corner of my eye. i got up to look and there was this thing..for lack of a better word.. flashing different bright colors in the sky. it really caught my interest. i stood there staring at it. i came to the conclusion it was a ufo. just a huge mass of circular flashing lights blinking and as i watched, a million thoughts ran through my head. what was it doing? am i going to get abducted? does that stuff really happen? a car alarm went off and i heard sirens all while i watched this ..thing.  it stayed in one spot for about 5 min then eventually when i looked down to text  my friend to go look i look up and it was gone. i never saw anything like this before. it really amazed me.;37.7944444444444;-121.222355555555
Floating ball of light making rapid movement in the sky with little faint lights moving around it.  Happening right now.;2013-11-03 01:09:00;currently;Floating ball of light making rapid movement in the sky with little faint lights moving around it.  Happening right now. I see what looks like a bright star in the sky but after watching I noticed it was moving very rapidly in every direction and little faint lights moving around it.  It's 1:15 am right now and its still there.at one point the light fell very fast towards the ground but then just stopped and went straight back up at high speed.  And I can't see it on my phonrles camera.;37.7944444444444;-121.222355555555
