Yellow haze light with no sound flying low to ground then disappeared into the night in Manteca, Ca;2008-10-17 21:12:00;2 minutes;Yellow haze light with no sound flying low to ground then disappeared into the night in Manteca, Ca I was getting on the 99 freeway headed north from Main St. and when I enetered the on ramp I seen a yellow light headed towards the head of my car moving real slow.  I told my son to look and keep an eye on it so I could exit the freeway at Lathrop Rd.  I exited the freeway while he kept an eye on it and we pulled over to the side of the road to watch this yellow light head south towards fresno and then it just disappeared.  It had no sound to it and flew about ten feet from the hood of my car.  I am totally amazed by this and tried to get a hold of the news but had no luck, so I went online and found a place to report it.;37.7944444444444;-121.222355555555
Multi-colored orb seen every night.;2016-05-15 21:00:00;30;Multi-colored orb seen every night. A flashing multi colored orb has been appearing in the horizon by my home every night for the past 3 weeks.  (the first week, the multi colored orb appeared once very saturday but for the past week to two weeks its been showing it self every night)  It appears at exactly 21:00 every night now and moves slowly down closer then disappears after 30 min then appears again at 3:00 am.   I have also had a close encounter where I witnessed a triangular craft that came around over my neighbors home and closely on the side of my home..it craft had 2 or 3 red lights and white glowing lights all around it but it wasn't round when it came closer it was a triangular shape and it never made one sound.  It came so close that I ran into the house to get my husband out of the restroom but by the time he had came outside the craft was further away and looked more like an airplane.  I believe that the multicolored orb is communicating with other bright lights in the sky.   I'm not a professional but I have a very strong feeling that something out there is trying to communicate with me.  I am very open minded and curious about whats out there but at the same time I get very nervous with what I will see if I continue to monitor I might not come back to share what I've experienced.
