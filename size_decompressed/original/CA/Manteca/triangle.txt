object was flying from north to south.at arms length a silverdollar would have been the size.no noise,very low.2 large lights on bottom;1998-05-16 22:30:00;45-50 second;object was flying from north to south.at arms length a silverdollar would have been the size.no noise,very low.2 large lights on bottom.solid object,til lights detached,one flew NE one NW. It was 10:30pm sat.(last-nite).I was laying on the divingboard, looking up at the sky.the sky seemed extra clear except, one large mass of low white cloud directly above me.It was long semi-wide and streched N to S.I was watching the cloud shape shift and change forms due to the wind.Then directly above me and a little to my right(north).I don't know if it caught my eye or just appeard.Below the already low clouds this large triangler object flying from N to S was at arms length, I approximate the size of a silver-dollar.The corners were all rounded.I was lookinging at the underneath part of the object.There was 2 very large circle lights.They did not glow like a light,the only way I can explain it is like the nite-lights you put in your house,the ones with the plastic white covers,how they look with light shining through them.That the closest I can explain how these lights glowed.The object itself was brown.It was below the white clouds so that allowed me to get a good clear look at it.There were no other lights whats so ever on the object.I stood up and started screaming my fiance's name,yelling look at this what is this!It continued to fly towards the south,about the speed of a jet,then as it got a ways to the left of me(south).I still had a good view due to the size,,it seems the end of the cloud may have hung lower than the rest of it, but was thinning out density wise. The object went into that part of the cloud I could still see it then the 2 lights that did seem to be a solid part of the object both at the same time in sync.widended out one to the left one to the right,moveded in little cirles in sync.the object was no longer visible,one light went back to the NE and one went back to the NW.Both moved in those directions what looked to be about 3inches in the skying,judging between my fingers and just went out or dissappeared.The rest of the object never came out of the clouds.IT made no noise,plane fly over all the time that low and you always hear them,helecopters that lw rattle the windows.Thi! s is close to the airport.I have had a very hard time even explaining yhis,and I did the best I could in words.Can you please let me know if anyone else reports this?;37.7944444444444;-121.222355555555
Triangular craft flew over houses in Manteca, Ca.;2008-11-19 18:00:00;5 minutes;Triangular craft flew over houses in Manteca, Ca. I was sittimg on the couch watching TV and heard my wife say what is that, hurry come here.  When I went to the back yard there was a triangular craft with lights at all three points and a fourth towards the back.  It was heading south at a constant pace and was enormous.  It was also at a very low altitude and made noise.  It was right over our house,so I ran to get my camera but by that time it was blocked by houses.  Then I saw it over some houses in the east far from where it was not 5 seconds before, so I ran out front to get a picture of it.  I was able to but it was far away.  About a half hour after this occured I saw what looked like a bright star fly in a straight line than dissaper in the sky.;37.7944444444444;-121.222355555555
We watched 2 orange onion shaped lights that were next to each other.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sky lanterns??  PD));2018-10-08 08:37:00;3 minutes;My daughter, son in law and i were sitting outside facing east.  We watched 2 orange onion shaped lights that were next to each other come up from behind a building across the street.   Next came 2 more showed up in the same formation.  Than a solo one showed up, forming a triangle with the 2nd set of lights.  The 1st set of lights quickly disappeared.  The remaining 3 that formed the triangle slowly spread, the bottom right light disappeared.  The bottom left light disappeared shortly later.  The top light got brighter and then rapidly disappeared.;37.7944444444444;-121.222355555555
