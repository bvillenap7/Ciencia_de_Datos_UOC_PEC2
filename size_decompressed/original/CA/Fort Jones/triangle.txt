My wife came out to see where I had gotten to. We both looked up at the edge of our roof and exactly at that moment, a HUGE black triangular shape object appeared and moved off in a W/N/W direction.  There were no lights and it made no sound.  We could see the shape of the craft against the backdrop of the stars and it had a metallic/black color.    From the time it appeared till the time we lost it was approximately 8 seconds.  It was HUGE. My wife and I looked at each other and asked if we had seen what we had seen, amazing experience.

Large Black Triangular UFO;2010-09-13 23:00:00;6 seconds;Large Black Triangular UFO At 23:00 hours, my wife joined me outside to watch the night sky, as we both looked up, we saw a huge triangular shaped UFO pass over the roof of our house, I would guess at around 20,000 ft. even at that height it was the size of two football fields. It was going WNW towards the Pacific Ocean. There was no sound, no lights, no vapour trail, and no sonic boom, even though it was gone over the horizon in 6 seconds, the large size of it made it appear to be in slow motion. It was flat black, but a bit luminescent.  I am a retired Hwy Patrol Officer and a credible witness.  My wife and I couldnâ€™t believe what we had just witnessed.
