Then noticed some star like lights moving through the sky and then ascending up until out of sight this continued for over an hour. S ome moving together some one at a time but eventually all ended up ascending up into the clouds out of sight meanwhile the original bright light drifted off until it was also out of sight.  seemed like every time they moved shortly after the wind would pick up they were never in any type of formation and never had any trail of lights following them.
