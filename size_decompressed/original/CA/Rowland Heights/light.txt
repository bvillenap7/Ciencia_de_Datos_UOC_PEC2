We lived on the second floor and with had a large panel of window on one side of our walls.  All the sudden, in the middle of the night, there was a bright light that shined through the window. I would say it most closely resembled the searchlight of a helicopter.  The light shined directly into our room with a beam of light that was parallel to the ground. It was perfectly stable and noiseless.  We stared at the blinding yellow light mindlessly not knowing what to think. What felt like at least five to ten minutes was probably a lot shorter than that.  To this day, my cousin and I can still vividly recall that night and what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));33.9854;-117.8972
