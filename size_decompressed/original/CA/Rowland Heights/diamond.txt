Huge dark object flying over the san gabriel mountain;2008-04-15 17:00:00;2 minutes;Huge dark object flying over the san gabriel mountain I was driving down the fullerton rd. towards the freeway 60 during the daytime when I saw a huge dark object moving behind the cloud formation over the san gabriel mountain.   At first, I thought it was a light or shadow reflection of some sort, but even then it was too huge and fast moving to satisfy those explanations.  The dark object suddenly peered out of the thick cloud and showed part of itself and I certainly think it was an object not a shadow or light reflections.   At that moment, my heart was racing and I tried to grab my camera, but the object took off and dissappeared.;33.9854;-117.8972
