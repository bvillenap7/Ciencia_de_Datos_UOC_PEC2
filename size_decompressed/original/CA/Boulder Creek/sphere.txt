It was an orange sphere that made ABSOLUTELY NO NOISE.  It seemed to slow down, speed up and slightly change direction as though it was looking for something I must note that these direction and velocity transitions were smooth and controlled.  The object decelerated and emitted a very bright orange light as it passed directly overhead.  When it got a few hundred yards passed my location the light dimmed as it accelerated towards the south out of my sight.
