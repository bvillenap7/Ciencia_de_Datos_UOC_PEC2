I was riding a Kawasaki 1000 motorcycle racing to work so I wouldn’t be late.  I was on disciplinary probation which meant I couldn’t be late or any other violation of company policy or I would be terminated other wise I would have stopped to investigate this oddity.  As I passed the City of Adelanto, on Hwy 395, I accelerated to approximately 120 mph because I was running late and this speed would get me to work on time.  Shortly after leaving the city limits I saw a brilliant flashing light (Strobe) below the horizon off in the distance where I was heading.  At this point the sun had not risen but was just minutes away from rising.  I was fixated on the flashing trying to figure out what it was.  It continued to flash with irregularly timed  pulses until I was about 2  miles or so away.  (Close enough so I was able to see it when it wasn’t flashing).   I slowed down to about 70 mph to try to figure out what it could be.  I stared intensely at the object as I was passing it.  It was now between me and the Eastern horizon.  The sky was bright and clear.  The object was perfectly round, appeared to be stationary, and was about 20-25 feet off the ground with a diameter of about 2’.  It was dull grey, seemed to be solid and reflected no light from the sun that was visible by then. ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
