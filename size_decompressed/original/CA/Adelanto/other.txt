I called my husband , and when I did and looked back, they were gone.  looked all around sky and could not find that configuration.  I was listening to art bell show on 11/15/03 and heard the witnesses mention that they had witnessed the same looking 'object' in sky.  I felt calm when watching it and calm after, although , I wanted my husband to see this.;34.5826;-117.424
