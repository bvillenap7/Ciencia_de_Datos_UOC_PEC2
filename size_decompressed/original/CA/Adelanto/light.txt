Bright light moving fast but not a shooting star;2011-08-30 21:00:00;1 minute;Bright light moving fast but not a shooting star We saw a light that look like a shooting star.  However it was moving way to slow to be one. It could not have been a helicopter or plane because there was no sound or color lights.  While we trying to figure what it was the bright light started to dim.  The light just went out slowly but the UFO just kept flying. We could just barely see the light and the UFO just stood still for we seconds.  Then it just disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
