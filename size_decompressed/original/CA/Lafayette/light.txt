At about 22:28 I witnessed a bright white light moving slowly about the same speed as the ISS crosses the sky, no flashing strobes to indicate an aircraft. the object was high in the sky but just east of my location in Lafayette, CA., it moved generally north to south for about two minutes and as it did it slowly dimmed to unobservable. I immediately checked the NASA sightings website for the ISS for my area but the next possible sighting for the ISS is on 7/6/16, meaning this was not the ISS that I witnessed. of course it was very dark, no moon, and there were no clouds or trees to obscure the visibility. At its brightest I would say it was twice as bright as the apparent brightness of the brightest star in the sky at that time.;37.8994;-122.1144
