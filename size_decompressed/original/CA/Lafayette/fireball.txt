Unusually bright meteor/re-entry event;1998-04-16 23:16:00;flash;Unusually bright meteor/re-entry event While travelling along a very dark and wooded road, I observed the flash of a meteor-like object in a clearing between some trees.  The object was bluish-white in color.  It gave the impression of being somewhat fuzzy and indistinct in shape - like a meteor but definately NOT an aircraft.  It's magnitude was much brighter than an aircraft's strobe light (x3).  The object was descending (rapidly).  It was observed to the west of my location (towards San Francisco).;37.8994;-122.1144
