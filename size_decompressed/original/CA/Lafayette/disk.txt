While I was in college living in an apartment in a house on the top of a small hill in Lafayette Ca. The home was secluded. I came home one evening and pulled into the driveway and saw something pass over the back yard,  which overlooked a vacant business with a large parking lot below the house..  I went to the edge of the back yard and looked down and saw a saucer shaped craft in a clearing below. I saw being milling about and the next think I knew there were a group of them coming up the hill and in the back yard.the next thing I rememberd was being alone in my apartment.
