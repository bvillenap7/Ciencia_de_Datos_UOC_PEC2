2 beams of light....small droid driving and inspecting property;2004-06-29 03:00:00;dream;2 beams of light....small droid driving and inspecting property I had this dream:  I was home in Lafayette, CA, where I actually live and was looking out the window at night from my office window.  I saw 2 tiny beams of light shining down from the sky from a very far away source.  They were extremely narrow and coming from very high up.  Higher than anything I knew of.  I yelled for my family to come see, Quick and my husband ran in the room, finally, and just as he did, the lights disappeared, but only momentarily.  They had bent, with angular shafts, behind clouds (?) and then reappeared.  I was so glad he could see what I saw!  We watched in awe and then we saw this tiny, blue helicoptor drop lower and lower from the sky where the beams were.  I thought, how funny, I've never seen a helicopter so small before! It came down to tree level and started moving around the trees and bushes next door, outside the window we were watching from.  Then it landed and wheels appeared.  it looked just like one of those sleds in the Olympics... 2 man bob-sleding.  It began moving around the neighbors bushes and driveway, going in and out everything it ran into. It made me think it was a robot. I thought, it's like a dog sniffing around the property.  Eventually, it made it to our house! Something told me it was looking for drugs! I knew I had none, but it stayed a really, really long time.;37.8994;-122.1144
