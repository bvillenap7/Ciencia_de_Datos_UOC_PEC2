A bright oval shaped light flying faster than anything I had ever seen before.;2000-10-01 14:00:00;2 minutes;A bright oval shaped light flying faster than anything I had ever seen before. Me and my girlfriend were parked in a grape vineyard I was 16 at the time, it was 2 in the morning. We are in the back seat of the car she was sitting up and I was laying down with my head in her lap.  My eyes were closed and we were just talking, I saw a bright light flash over my eyelids my eyes were closed but I could still see the light through my eyelids, I got scared because she had taken her step moms car without asking her and niether of us had a drivers license.  I open my eyes immediately and say what was that is there a car coming she looks back and says no theres no car there so I sit up look out the back window and see something I will never forget, I see a bright oval shaped light flying away from us it flies about 300 yards away from us banks hard left then super hard right and flies away faster than any airplane fly, by far faster than any aircraft we have, we both saw it because I look at her and the look on her face was of astonishment and I ! said did you see that she said yes we then both began to look at our surroundings realizing we were surrounded by vineyards seeing the wind blow through the leaves we couldnt discern whether or not there was something walking around out there, I jumped in the front seat started the car and we were out of there I hit pot holes flying out of there but I didnt care if I messed up her step moms car I was ready to leave ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Strange orange light seen south of Madera.  Went to get binoculars and a minute later the light was gone.;2007-05-04 22:30:00;2 minutes;Strange orange light seen south of Madera.  Went to get binoculars and a minute later the light was gone. At 10:30 pm I had arrived at my home when I noticed a bright orange light in the eastern part of the sky.  I watched it for a few seconds to see if it was stationary or was moving.  It was not making any noise, but what attracted me to it was the brightness of it.  When I discerned it was stationary I went back to my car (50' from where I noticed the light) to fetch my binoculars to get a better view of the light.  When I returned to where I orginally was at the time when I saw the light, it was gone.  I had not notice any flash or hear any sounds that may have been of a departing craft.  I did notice two seperate sets of aircraft lights that were farther in the distance, but they were flying in opposite directions and all I could see of them was a red light (but I could hear their engines).  I doubt the orange light was a star or planet as it was the brighest object in the sky and was at least 75% brighter then the next brighest object (which is either Venus or Jupitor, I'm not sure, which ever is in the western part of the sky at this time).  I did go back outside about twenty minutes later to see if the light had maybe returned.  At this time the moon had risen and I noticed a star or planet to the upper left of the moon.  This was not the same object, but I felt I should note this.;36.9739644628099;-120.029975206612
Two lights in the sky,one seemed to follow the other as if in formation.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly the ISS and Space Shuttle??  PD));2007-11-05 05:55:00;3 minutes;Two lights in the sky,one seemed to follow the other as if in formation. I arrived at work this morning and saw two lights moving in the sky. It was still dark but the sun was starting to come up from behind the mountains to the east. The lights were in the west south west sky when I spotted them and moved to the east north east,they moved almost directly overhead. When I saw them I told another guy who just got out of his car to look and as we were watching,two more people got there and I pointed the lights out to them also. The lights almost looked connected as the brighter one seemed to lead the dimmer one. The two moved as if in formation but not like aircraft in that the dimmer light was directly behind the other. The light was white in color and there were no blinking lights like would be on an aircraft and I know aircraft don't follow directly behind one another. I would estimate the speed at between 200 to 400 miles per hour. I estimate the altitude at between 8,000 to 15,000 feet. It would seem that they were about 500 to 800 feet apart. There was no noise heard from the objects. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle.  PD));36.9739644628099;-120.029975206612

White light makes a turn and disappears.;2015-10-22 19:55:00;3 minutes;White light makes a turn and disappears I live about eight miles west of the Madera Municipal Airport.  I earned my private pilot's license at that airport.  The approaches for the Madera airport and the Fresno Air Terminal beyond it are directly over my house for aircraft coming from the Bay Area. In the evenings, I see aircraft with their landing lights on approaching from the northwest and heading towards the southeast.  As they get closer, you can hear their engines, see the strobes, and finally see the red and green navigation lights when they are directly overhead. Fifteen minutes ago, I was out in my yard when I saw what I thought was a light aircraft with its landing lights on approaching from the northwest.  The sky was partially overcast with wispy clouds.  The light seemed to be going at about the same speed as a light aircraft and was at about 8000 or 9000 feet altitude. I watched it, waiting to see the strobe as it got closer and listening for engine sounds, but it remained silent, and there were no visible strobes or navigation lights.  Then it began a slow, wide turn to the south.  It's hard to describe, but it almost seemed to slide.  The color of the light was almost the same color as a landing light. After the 90 degree turn, landing lights would not have been visible on an airplane, but this light remained constant.  Then it began to speed up, and it either gained altitude, or the light faded out.  I don't know which, but it just disappeared. I know some people will say it was an airplane, but it wasn't.  When it was overhead, I should have seen a strobe and the red and green navigation lights, and it should not have had white lights facing backwards.  Also, it's possible to hear a jet or propeller engine at that altitude, and it went from a constant brightness to a dim light to nothing in about  five seconds time.  It wasn't an airplane.;36.9739644628099;-120.029975206612

As I was looking at the stars, I observed an object that was from the east about the attitude of an aircraft.  Although it was not making any sound.  Object had at least three to four lights, green and red.  As it silently went by above me across the night sky disappearing towards west.;36.9739644628099;-120.029975206612
