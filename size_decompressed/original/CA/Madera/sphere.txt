White spherical object w/possible point at the bottom and blinking red and green lights.;2012-10-08 21:00:00;30 minutes;White spherical object w/possible point at the bottom and blinking red and green lights. At approx. 9:30 pm I was looking at the stars from my backyard with Nikon binoculars.  I was observing the Plaiedes to the East  when I noticed a bright white star-like object just to the left of them.  When looking at the star-like object through my binoculars, I could see it blinked rapidly with red and green lights.  It stayed stationary in the sky and did not appear to be coming towards me, as an aircraft would.    I moved my location to the front yard and observed it from a slightly different angle.  It was the same.  The object was spherical, however it seemed to have a faint tail-like point at the bottom.  The object was still blinking red and green, very rapidly.  I called my son out into the front yard to observe it through the binoculars  and asked him to describe to me what he was seeing.  He described it exactly as I did - a spherical object with red and green blinking lights.  I asked him if, in his opinion the object was moving and he said no, it was not.;36.9739644628099;-120.029975206612
