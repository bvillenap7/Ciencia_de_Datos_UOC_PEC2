Ufo seen hovering over a house.;2010-08-20 00:00:00;2-5 minutes;Ufo seen hovering over a house. It was around midnight when I was leaving my friends house, as I was walking home I saw a weird round object from the corner of my eye.  It was just hovering over a house about 7 feet over the house.  I had never seen a ufo so I wanted to see exactly what it looked like up close and as I moved in, it just stood there above the house.  I was able to see it clearly. It was round shaped with lights around the middle and under it was a small round bottom.  It made no sound but when I started getting closer it seemed to have noticed me because it started slowly moving away.  I started to speed walk to catch up to it but the ufo just kept slowly gaining speed.  Eventually, I started running after the ufo but lost it over a near by park.   I ran home to tell my mother what I had seen and she laughed, but at that moment she was talking to her boyfriend over the phone who said he say it too, it had pased by the freeway that is just behind the near by park in which I lost sigh! t of it.
