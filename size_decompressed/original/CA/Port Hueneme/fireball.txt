Flying object on fire then glowing White in sky Over Ocean;2010-11-05 19:30:00;3-5 minutes;Flying object on fire then glowing White in sky Over Ocean My husband and I went outside at about 7:30 pm to take a walk out to the Beach and Pier by our condo.  We were walking out of our complex when I saw to the North West an object coming towards us high in the sky and proceeded down the ocean (southeast) which I thought to be a Large rocket because it was Glowing Fire and was Orange Racing Across the Sky but it was very high up and going up at a slant.  It continued to do this for about a minute on fire and then the fire went out and the object was white and glowingâ€¦.. Totally white and like a dot,  kind of how a plane would appear in the sky from a long distance away.  The glow flew over the sky about the speed of a plane but a tad faster and leveled off out over the ocean where it started to arch down towards the ocean.  We watched it as it grew smaller and smaller and went out then it came on again for just a second and then went out completely.  At this time it was almost directly out in front of us out over the! ocean and the Port Hueneme Pier but pretty far out there.   After that we were blown away and I wanted to get back in the house to Google it or see if I could find out what happened.  As we were walking back to the Condo A Huge Jumbo jet, flew over us from the north fairly low (This never happens right over the condos) and then another came about 5 seconds after that both going out over the ocean to the same area the object disappeared and then towards the east like towards Point Mugu.;34.1592;-119.1986
