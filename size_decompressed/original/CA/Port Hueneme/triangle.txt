Black trianular object with six very large faint light blue lights along the leading edges of each side;2016-02-13 22:30:00;4 seconds;Black trianular object with six very large faint light blue lights along the leading edges of each side at 9:30pm, on 2/13/16, I was laying on my back floating in the swimming pool of our condominium.  A black triangle passed over traveling westward.  The objects edges could be seen as the light from the stars was blocked by its passing.  The objects leading edges had six very large electric blue circular lights along them.  The lights were very dim as if they were some sort of energy, or plasma emitting from holes on the bottom leading edges of the object.   The object was moving at four or five hundred M.P.H.  The triangle was very large, if compared with the commercial airliners that were also passing over from South to North.  I did not hear any sound as my ears were submerged in the pool water.  I could clearly see the shape of the object as the star light above it was blocked out.  It was probably three, or four hundred feet from corner to corner, and the largest flying the that I ever saw.  I have seen the B2 Bomber fly over The Rose Bowl, and over Palmdale.  This object was not the B2 Bomber.;34.1592;-119.1986
