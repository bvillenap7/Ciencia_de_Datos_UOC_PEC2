Walking home from a store I looked up in the sky seen a bright circle light that started moving left and right at great speeds, then it shot up straight about 500 feet and then fell back down at incredible speed then it just went black.  3 seconds or more went by then a real bright light appeared again and started repeating the movements described.  I went back into the store ask the clerk to come take at look and when we came out it was gone then it reappeared in brilliant bright light again, clerk went back in the store and I headed home keeping my eyes on the object in the sky.;34.1592;-119.1986
