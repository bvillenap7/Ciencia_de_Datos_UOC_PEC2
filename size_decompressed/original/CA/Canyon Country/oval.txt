Large oval shaped white light.;2014-04-25 21:05:00;10 seconds;large oval shaped white light just out walking my dog as i do every night around my neighborhood, when i at at first i thought to be a spotlight, like what you would see at a movie premiere or store grand opening, but it was much larger, 10 x larger if i had to guess, and it wasn't the typical warm, yellow light, it was a cool bluish white,the typical LED color you would see on newer cars headlights, etc... Also, it appeared in the center of the sky, and moved quickly to my right, which is west. It definitely caught my eye, because of the size and color, but when ot didn't come back around, as a spotlight would, thats what really got me excited.
