Very painful and terrifing.;2004-07-04 21:00:00;1 hour;Very painful and terrifing. I have fallen asleep with my sister in bed while watching a movie, when suddenly a VERY bright light shined in my in the window and woke me up when 2 strange figures somehow telenetikly lifted me and my sister in the air. I couldn't move, I could only blink  and  move my eyes. We somehow went right through the window, I glanced at my sister and she looked terrified! We went on a space craft into white room where other people were screaming in fear, children crying. These things with the most strangest eyes stuck VERY sharp, hot , and EXTREMLY painful things into my ears, anus, eyes, and testicals. Before i knew it, I was back in bed with my sister and i saw a bright light slow fading. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I was in my backyard on top of the hill in Canyon Country California. I was with a friend we were taking pictures of the stars on a tripod.  My friend was looking through the viewfinder in one direction over my house I was looking out into the sky overlooking the Santa Clarita Valley and saw a ridiculously fast object slide through the sky at a lightning fast speed.  The object was about 10,000 feet in the sky and was dark in color.  The object had no lights on it or coming from it.  The object flew straight from right to left and did not make a sound.  As I saw the object, immediately yelled to my friend and by the time he looked over at my direction in was gone. The object appeared to be moving through the sky as if it did not want to be noticed disappearing into dark grey sky to my left.  I was only able to see the object because I happened to be looking at that spot at the exact time it was moving through that area slightly lit by the city lights.   I have never seen an aircraft move as fast as this one did, it took a while for my brain to actually comprehend what it was I had just seen. Iâ€™m still having a hard time accepting what I saw, I have never seen anything like this.;34.4208831395348;-118.439809302326
