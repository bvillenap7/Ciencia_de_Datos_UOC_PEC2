Object trailing a commercial airplane.;2006-06-03 14:00:00;10 minutes;Object trailing a commercial airplane. At about 14:00 my daughter, wife and I were looking at at high flying aircraft (commercial) and following the fuel trail on the clear sky. We then realized there was another object, smaller in size but same altitude (20K feet)flying a little behind and above the airplane.  The type of movement and flying pattern was different than that of the airplane.  It looked more steady, perhaps slower speed.  As the airplane continued towards a north-easterly direction, the object drifted more towards the southeastern direction.  We tohught it could have been a helium balloon that had gotten loose.  However, at the same time a smaller airplane (private plane) flew around the same direction as that of the object and then we realized this strange object was definitely a lot higher and could not possibly be a small balloon as we could see it on its steady course and round shape (it looked white from our point of view).  As my wife and I (and small daugther ) kept our eye on the object, it suddenly stopped and it sat there for a few seconds.  It then vanished.
