There was absolutly no sound. I awoke, at 03:53 on 5/14/08, to an amazingly bright blue light shining directly through my black mini blinds into my face. I quickly opened the window to see a large electron blue star slowly moving across the sky. This star suddenly became very large and seemed like it exploded, yet there was absolutly no sound. Out of this star came an oddly shaped aircraft that looked similar to a space shuttle, yet instead of having wings on the sides, it had two cylinders that thrust came out of. The ship took off like a bat out of hell, faster than any airplane i have ever seen. The odd thing was that the star it came out of was traveling east, while the ufo shot south. The small glimpse that I got of this craft showed two very bright red lights on the bottom, a green light on the nose, and the rest of the craft glowed orange. After the craft disappeared (which only took a second) i saw three other glowing stars, same as the first. Within half of a minute, they faded awy. During the whole expeience, there was never any sound.;34.4208831395348;-118.439809302326
