I was sleeping on the couch and woke up and was laying there looking out a high window in our house and noticed this exceptionally bright light. starred at for about 20 mins before wakeing my girl friend and showing her to confirm....very bright white lights aprox 3 in a yor V pattern high in the sky. The moon was bright and there were many stars in the sky but this was much brighter then anything else. Its some what hovering but is also moiving sporadically in all directions like jumping around. sometimes its movement is sideways to us and very noticablely in bigger increments. We also could tell it would get further away as it s getting harder to distinguish the seperate lights that made up its shape when we first noticed it. Its still there now as we been watching it for aprox an hour now. we see planes as normal and its not comparable to any of them as we see them at the same time . its been 90 mins now and the sun is coming up making the stars dim and this thing is still as bright as ever but seems further away or higher........just went back out to see if it was still there.The stars sre gone as the sun is rising but this is still as bright and the only 2 things in the sky, the bright moon and this bright object. seems further away now but i can still tell its seperate lights that make up its shape.;34.4208831395348;-118.439809302326
