Triangle shaped light formation seen over Catalina Island by many people.;2002-07-23 22:30:00;About 3 minutes;Triangle shaped light formation seen over Catalina Island by many people. I was at a summer camp on Catalina Island, CA at Toyon Bay near Avalon.  I was walking away from the beach at night in a crowd of maybe 40 people.  Above us we saw a triangle formation of lights, kind of like how geese fly in formation. There was a very bright white light in front with red lights trailing it.  There were many witnesses, but i could not take a picture.  The entire formation was several times larger than the moon (which was full or close to full) and it was moving very slowly across the sky.  The lights did not flash.  As the formation got about halfway across the sky, a very, very low, quiet engine sound became audible.  It was like a very very far away jet, but the sound was flat.  It really freaked me out.  I thought it could be a stealth bomber or a high up formation of military jets, but the lights did not blink or flash and they stayed in perfect formation.  I have no idea what it was.  It was flying from the northwest, towards Avalon.;33.3328;-118.3481
