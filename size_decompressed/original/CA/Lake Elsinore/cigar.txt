Lake Elsinore sighting 8/2/10 0600;2010-08-02 06:00:00;2 Minutes;Lake Elsinore sighting 8/2/10 0600 I was driving up the Ortega Hwy going home from working the night shift.  I usually got off at 6:30, but this day I got off at 5:30 which allowed me to see the sunrise.   Well as I got over the peak of the mountain I decided to pull over and take several pictures of the sunrise.  It wasn't until the next day that I noticed in 2 of the pictures that there was an object in roughly the same area of the sky, but these pictures were not sequential.  Lets say I took 10 pictures, the object was in pictures 5 and 9.   I noticed the object in the 2nd picture (picture 9), and it got me curious to see if it was in any others.   Of the 5 pictures 4 were of the same area of the sky, and there was no trace of the object in the middle pictures. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report forwarded two photos of a sunrise sky.  There is a very small, blurry, light-colored object, approximately 1/4 or 1/3 (est.) the diameter of the rising sun.  It could be a clump of cloud, an aircraft, we believe.  If it is a genuine UFO, we cannot confirm that fact, based on the information provided by the witness.  PD));33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
