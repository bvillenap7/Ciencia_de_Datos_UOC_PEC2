Floating light suddenly moves slowly then speeds off into space!;2006-09-10 21:00:00;15 seconds;Floating light suddenly moves slowly then speeds off into space! I was taking my girl friend home.  It was somewhere between 9:00pm- 9:05pm and I can tell you right now what i saw was real.   I hadn't been drinking nor was a I tired so nothing was able to mess with my mind and make me see things that weren't there!   So my girl goes inside her house and I look ahead and start my car.  I look up in the sky because i noticed a light.   Now at first i was thinking to myself, wow, that star is pretty close to be looking that big and so up clear.   Then i noticed it was moving very slowly, and all of a sudden it sped off so fast that if I was to blink I would have not seen it fly off into space like it did.   I doubt our military or any other military has a plane or any flying craft that can just float and looks so still, move slowy then speed off so fast into space like that!

Spinning round object over Lake Elsinore;2008-01-31 12:05:00;3-4 minutes;Spinning round object over Lake Elsinore This event occurred as my self and two other witnesses were proceeding to our cars in the company parking lot of our place of work, which is located at the edge of the local airport’s runway. Upon looking up, I noticed what looked like a perfectly round white balloon travelling in a perfect straight line in a westerly direction. This caught my attention as I knew balloons don’t usually travel through the sky this way. As I mentioned to my co-workers to look up at what I thought was a balloon, the object was continuing in the straight line but was slowing to a complete stop, at about 15 degrees from directly above us, towards the north. We agreed that the object was being too stable for a balloon that was at that high altitude. At this time, my co-workers mentioned that the object was actually spinning in an elliptical fashion, like an egg being spun on counter, with a slight wobble. After pausing at the spot for about 15 to 20 seconds, it proceeded to slowly rise at a very steep angle until it was out of sight.  We scoured the Net the following week for any indication of other people seeing what we saw, or if it was any other explainable phenomenon, natural or otherwise, but did not see any reports.;33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
Hundreds of lights over Lake Elsinore 11/01/2013 7-7:30 pm.;2013-11-01 19:30:00;10 minutes;Hundreds of lights over Lake Elsinore 11/01/2013 7-7:30pm I am  a 33 year old man and work as a project manager.  It was about 7 to 7:30pm.  My Wife, my three sons had left our home in Lake Elsinore and were heading to camp Pendleton to go camping with family for the weekend.  We were heading south on the I-15 approaching exit to HWY 74 and I was on speaker phone with my brother asking for directions when I noticed a line of lights in the eastern sky approaching from a distance.  Just as I began to mention them to my wife, the freeway came to almost a complete stop adjacent to the outlets mall.  People were pulling over on the sides of the freeway and as we crawled forward I could then see that the lights I saw were part of stream of lights crossing over the freeway.   I pulled over on the side of the freeway, and stepped just out of my vehicle, directly under the stream of lights.  The lights flashed but to me they seemed almost holographic.  Bluish-white sphere shaped approx. four to six feet in diameter (seemed to vary in size and distance)  The nearest ones to us were about 100 above us at their lowest point.   As they moved they seemed to flutter around almost like a group of butterflies, but in a deliberate direction west.  When they flashed I could almost make out a silhouette of something inside the light orb.   As I was looking up, describing the scene to my brother on the phone, my wife yelled, Oh my God, there are hundreds!   I turned towards the west and saw a huge swarm of them over Lake Elsinore that the stream seemed to be dumping into.  I hung up with my brother and called my neighbors, who went out to see the lights.  I then called my best friend, who went out and saw the lights as well.   Then I got back in my vehicle.  I wanted to take HWY 74 and follow the objects, but at this time my wife and children became very afraid.   So we decided to continue south, the long way so as to avoid the lights.   My wife has some phone footage as well as my neighbors.  These things didn't seem to be aircraft, or spacecraft. they seemed organic, or alive, so to speak.;33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
