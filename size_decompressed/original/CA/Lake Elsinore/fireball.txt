My father and I were driving to pick up his friend from my grandmothers house.  My grandmother lives on a mountain.  So we were driving and I looked out my fathers window.  Then I saw 8 lights blinking in a circle.  I told my father to look and he saw them also.  Then we checked back in about 1 minute and they were splitting up.  I kept my eye on them but after a while they just disapeared into the dark stary sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
Bright, maybe burning, object traveling extremely fast explodes over Lake Elsinore;2006-09-11 00:30:00;1 second;Bright,maybe burning, object traveling extremely fast exlodes over Lake Elsinore I was driving southbound on the I-15, just past Lake Street on the north side of Lake Elsinore. A very bright and very fast moving object in they sky to my forward-left caught my eye and I watched it for maybe one whole second when it exploded. My first thought was that I might have just seen the Shuttle Atlantis burning up and exploding. It was like a ship on fire, burning light of white and a little yellow in a kind of corona around a central mass that was traveling at tremendous speed and then it exploded in the air in a conical fashion. About the time the debris cone got to three times the diameter of the original object the 'fire' went out and nothing of it was visible in the dark. I can estimate the speed at around 3600 mph because for the second (if that) that I saw the object it traveled the length of a hill/mountain top that is somewhat like a mesa in shape and is a mile in length. However, the object appeared to be about 5 miles beyond the 'mesa' and from my perspective about 5 degrees above the mesa and in slight declination... for reference my distance from the mesa was about a mile. The freeway is pretty much going south-east where I was at, so I guess the object was traveling south, but I can't be sure becuase the 15 fwy changes direction alot. I'm sure the media would have already have the story out if the shuttle exploded, so it wasn't that. Other possibilities would include a meteor, but I would guess that a meteor that big would cause some major damage, and not be at such a slight declination at such a low altitude. It left a briefly glowing trail and I heard no sounds.;33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
Monitored radio report of crashed object on fire, meteors;2011-09-14 20:30:00;15 minutes;Monitored radio report of crashed object on fire, meteors On the evening of 09/14/2011 I was sitting on my deck, watching the sky.  I was also listening to a scanner radio, as I had seen a USAF C-17 from March ARB circling overhead and was trying to pick up radio comms from March field.   About 2030 hours I heard a dispatcher from the Riverside County Sheriff's Dept. calling their helicopter to investigate a report of a downed aircraft in the Lake Elsinore area. The dispatcher told the pilot that a motorist on the freeway had seen an orange object, apparently on fire and leaving a trail of fire, pass over their vehicle and crash behind a ridge, where it was now starting a brush fire, as the sky was starting to glow orange.  A ground unit was also sent to check the area. The pilot acknowledged and reported a 7 minute ETA.   On arrival, the pilot checked the area and reported to dispatch that he could not locate any object or fire.  He added that he had used FLIR as well, and that he was not NVG equipped, and requested furt! her information. The dispatcher advised that there was a helicopter reported overdue from Hawthorne airport, but no other information.  She added that dispatch was receiving numerous reports of “meteors” in the same area as the alleged crash. The pilot and ground unit both reported that they could find no signs of a crash or fire and cleared the call. I am reporting this in case you receive any reports from the Lake Elsinore area for this time frame.  I did not observe any meteor s while I was watching the sky that evening, and I was facing south towards the area of the reports.  The sky was fairly clear with a few high clouds.  There was thunderstorm activity to the northeast over the desert areas.;33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
