Well after my first glance i really didn't know what to make of it, my wife and i were driving on the 15 fwy going south near lake Elsinore, then when i took a closer look i had to actually pull over to the shoulder off the fwy stopped my vehicle and was amazed of what we were looking at, i was looking at the horizon of the mountains and comparing it with the objects i was seeing.   What we saw were at least 50 to 100 oval metallic and sometimes flat shaped and even transparent in nature looking objects move up down from side to side in clusters sometimes they would separate into two large clusters, one of the objects even took off straight up from the others like a missile then straight down and back with the others.  These objects would change direction in such a matter so quickly that from my experience as a retired fireman and who's been around aircraft for over 30 years, there is nothing you can compare with the speed of which these things would move from one area to another.  They would at times disappear and reappear while changing in color from a shinny metallic to a dark color. then after approximately 30 to 40 minutes they started moving toward an east/south direction over the 15 fwy and out of our view in a cluster like formation and extremely fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Husband's report.  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded and objective in his reporting of the objects.  Witness is a former public employee, who had a considerable amount of responsibility.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD));33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
Extremely bright sphere over Canyon Lake, Canyon Hills area;2012-05-19 20:15:00;30 minutes;Extremely bright sphere over Canyon Lake, Canyon Hills area My husband and I have been seeing this same &quotobject&quot periodically since moving into our house.  We live in Canyon Hills and for almost 6 months saw the object down in the valley - 364 degrees north.  We didn't normally see it until after 10:00 p.m.  Within the past two weeks we are seeing it earlier (tonight right at dusk) at 288 degrees west.  I have several pictures and video. When looking at the object with the naked eye it appears extremely bright and normally remains still.  There have been times when it would go extremely bright red, then in the blink of an eye dim to where you almost couldn't see it.  It would then go bright and move vertically - then immediately disappear.  At times there have been two objects. When we zoom in with the video we discovered that the object is actually continually moving in zig zag movements - extremely fast.  Then it stops and blows into a huge, bright round ball. We would love to figure out what this is.  The video is quite compelling.;33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
