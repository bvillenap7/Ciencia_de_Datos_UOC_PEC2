The craft was boomerang shaped and was witnessed by the four people in my party, on a sunny afternoon.;1999-05-02 15:30:00;50-60 seconds;The craft was boomerang shaped and was witnessed by the four people in my party, on a sunny afternoon. We (two adults & two children) were pulling up in our car at the local grocery store when we saw a large (dc-10 size), completely matte black, boomerang shaped object in the sky.  It was about 1/4mile away and about 500ft in altitude.  We observed it through open windows in our car.  The weather was clear and sunny and we watched it fly over several local hills for a little less than a minute until it passed behind a larger hill and we could no longer see it.  It was coming from the south and headed toward the north and was moving slowly (about 90mph-although it was hard to gauge accurate speed), and it was completely silent.  We heard no noise whatsoever, which is what surprised us the most. Being as that it was so low we thought we should be able to hear it.  Our backgrounds:  I work in the computer industry and the other adult witness works in construction metals salesmanagement.  We are both in our mid-30's. We are making no claim that this was any type of extraterrestrial craft, only that it was unidentifiable, flying and an object.;33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
Giant black plane;2012-10-03 05:00:00;15-20 seconds;Giant black plane I work night shifts. I had gotten off early and was sitting outside before I tried to go bed.  It caught my eye when it lit up. At first, I thought it was a shooting star but there were 2 bright lights, parallel to each other, moving at the same speed. It didn't go very far before it took off but when it did, the sky around it lit up for a minute.  It looked like a plane, only black and a lot bigger. And even though it was big, it shot off fast.  I only saw it for a few seconds after it took off. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
Hundreds of mini stars flying low above the ground.;2013-11-01 19:32:00;6 minutes;Hundreds of mini stars flying low above the ground. It was a new moon night and approaching from the North at about 500 ft over the ground. Hundreds of very bright lights, like small stars, blue white in color, were traveling across the sky at about 5 to 15 mph.  Each light was a individual light .   I am a hang glider pilot , and watching the movement , it looked like birds with a very high power ball of light attached.  At one moment the cluster turned into a column gaining altitude.  The show was amazing. Cars pulling off the road everywhere.  The main cluster moved to the west at about 1500 ft agl now and was out of sight towards the coast.  There was a few ball of lights on there own maybe half a mile behind the main group and trying to catch up.  I have never seen anything like it.  My best guess is some kind of a experiment. I think the lumen s of the lights was very high, very bright .  I am doing all i can now to find out what it was.  Amazing to say the lease.;33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
30 to 40 Star like objects moving in the sky to form one giant star like object;2019-10-18 20:00:00;7 min;30 to 40 Star like objects moving in the sky to form one giant star like object So my family and I were at a baseball stadium that was for haunted houses so very dark so the stars were very easy to see and in the distance we saw about 30 to 40 stars and we thought it was a constellation but they all started to move so three of us stay and watched them and they all moved into one big ball of light like a huge star and we looked away for not even a minute and it just disappeared, not one light in the sky. Like it was never there. And we kept looking all night and couldnâ€™t  see it again.;33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
