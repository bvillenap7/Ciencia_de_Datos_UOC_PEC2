Disk light object with rotating white lights along bottom disappears after 5 min.;2010-04-24 21:00:00;4-5 Minutes;Disk light object with rotating white lights along bottom disappears after 5 min. At approximately 9:00pm PT I was driving north in Lake Elsinore California. It was a clear night sky many stars were visible. My 6 year old son was riding passenger and I was on my phone with a friend. She heard everything I’m about to recount. What I saw was at approx. 350 degrees in the north sky and at about a 45 degree angle. At first I thought it was a blimp because the size was about that along with the shape, longer body with a shorter height like one of the super large Goodyear blimps you see at sporting events. Then I realized it wasn’t moving at all and my visibility got better to where I could tell the height wasn’t much at all. Along the bottom it had white lights that were circling it. The reason I know the lights were moving and not a blinking sequence is because there was a small obvious break in the lights. At the top it appeared to have two smaller lights one red and one white. I decided to keep driving and try to get a closer look to figure out what exactly I was seeing. As I approached the bottom lights turned off and all I could see vaguely were the top lights. It still seemed a distance away at that point. I made a turn on a side street to continue trying to get closer and after passing a tree I could no longer see anything there, no red light nothing at all. It seemed to have disappeared after about a 4 minute show. I kept asking my son if he was seeing what I was seeing and he was. There was no doubt in either of our minds we were seeing something very unusual in our night sky.;33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182

Three disks hovering in the same spot for about 2 minutes each disk had some sort of tail the disks formed a triangle that was not perpendicular to the ground but was at an angle with the upper craft at the top the craft at the bottom looked as if it where searching for something  the crafts dissapeared upward, just before going upward they released some small stream of discharge the top crafts light dissapeared first and then the bottom two dissapeared immediatley afterward. There was no sound except low buzz/rumble. ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected parachute jumpers. PD));33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
