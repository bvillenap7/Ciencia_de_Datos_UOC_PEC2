White oval object in the skies above Lake Elsinore.;2008-01-31 12:05:00;3-4 min.;White oval object in the skies above Lake Elsinore. We walked out of the office to go to lunch and just happen to glance up in the sky. The reason for this is because there is a municipal airport runway behind our building that is used for sky jumping. So as we where looking for jumpers we saw an object that the first witness thought was a balloon. The object was moving horizontal in a westerly direction, too fast and straight for a balloon, then slowed down to a complete stop where the other two witnesses noticed that it was spinning (this is how we could see the shape was oval because it looked like and egg spinning on the counter). Then it just slowly ascended into the sky where it vanished from view.  We waited for a few days to see if it would be reported, but have not read or seen any thing in the local news or online.

Two clusters of oval, metallic-sided objects were seen flying high above Lake Elsinore. ((NUFORC Note:  Wife's report.  PD));2010-06-06 11:15:00;45 min;Two clusters of oval, metallic-sided objects were seen flying high above Lake Elsinore. At first glance I thought it was a transparent parachute with silver spots, a flock of birds or balloons all in the air seemingly joined together at a high altitude, but when they moved some of the shapes (about 30 or so) darted around more randomly than others.  Then as if turning sideways, they would suddenly disappear, then appear again in a random group.  There were at least two separate clusters of shapes with at least one metallic side on each shape, just hovering and moving almost in a circular motion, not far from each other.  We watched them for about a half hour with some other curious onlookers and nobody could tell what they were...the two clusters eventually joined in a line above us and went south east of us. After a few minutes of watching these objects and evaluating their movements, it was obvious that they were not birds, balloons, kites or parachutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Wife's report.  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB, on this date, but the launch occurred at 15:25 hrs., June 06, 2010.  PD));33.6632665454545;-117.343421818182
