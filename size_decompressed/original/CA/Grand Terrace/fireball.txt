Around 2 am I was in my backyard and looked up towards the sky over San Bernardino and saw a bright fireball, 3,000-4,000 feet If I had to guess, very slowly moving in the direction of Grand Terrace were I was, and with a small blinking light slowly moving in the opposite direction towards the San Bernardino Mountains.  Then another small blinking light came from the fireball, and followed the first blinking light, that I did not see if it in fact came from the fireball but I would think it did.  Both blinking lights were identical. I focused on the fireball which was moving a little faster now but still slow.  I ran upstairs and woke up my girlfriend and she witnessed the fireball the last 20 seconds as it stopped then appeared to flicker a couple times and slowly started to disappear.  There were a couple small light clouds in the sky but not near the fireball.  Last Christmas I saw a Chinese lantern which took me 20 seconds to tell what it was.  And this was no! t a lantern which I viewed for about 4 minutes. No sound heard.;34.0295;-117.31
Glowing orange orb dropping burning flares out of it, straight down to the ground.;2019-07-23 21:00:00;1 minute;Glowing orange orb dropping burning flares out of it, straight down to the ground. Looking to the east, toward the banning pass, Mt. San Jacinto area, I saw a glowing orange orb like a fireball hovering constant in the sky.  While other air traffic with flashing lights passed, the orb stayed in place and began dropping what looked like flares of the same color straight down out of it.  Dozens dropped out and they disappeared as if disintegrating toward the ground.  The event lasted about a minute, and the orb then faded from view.;34.0295;-117.31
