It was only visible in the night sky for approx. two seconds. About 8:42 p.m. October 24, 1997 we were in the car on Highway 80 traveling east.  Just past Vallejo in the hills at the American Canyon exit we saw the strangest light.  It was round and glowed blue-green all around the object.  It was traveling very fast towards the ground in a straight line.  It was only visible for approximately two secods then it disappeared above the ground.  It was't a plane or anything else known to us.  We are a retired married couple in our fifties.  My husband used to be a truck owner-operator and I was a secretary before we retired .  We have never reported anything like this before.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478

My brother and I were on our way home when we passed up an auto mall, and in the center of the road about 20 feet in front of us we saw a bright light in the shape of a sphere.  It then quickly shot to the right side next an overpass we were about to pass up.  It got brighter and looked like it exploded, and then instantly disappeared after that.  My brother and I looked at each other puzzlingly and wondered what it was.  We both agreed later on that it must have been a UFO.  There were no other lights at either side of the road at the time.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
