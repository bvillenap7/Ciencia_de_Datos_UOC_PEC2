ABOUT 45 SECONDS LATER WE COULD BOTH SEE IT WAS ACRAFT OF SOME KIND BUT WHAT WE HAD NO IDEA. AT THIS TIME THE OBJECT WAS DIRECTLY OVER HEAD. IT WAS SHAPED LIKE A DIAMOND YOU SEE IN PLAYING CARDS. THE OBJECT HAD NO LIGHTS OF ITS OWN BUT WAS CLEARLY LIGHT UP BY THE LIGHTS OF TOWN. IT MOVED SILENTLY THROUGH SKY. NO NOISE WHAT SO EVER. IT WAS METALIC IN COLOR, WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE SQUARE OPENINGS ON THE UNDER SIDE WITH WHAR LOOKED LIKR PIPES RUNNING THROUGH THE BOXES.IT WENT IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO THE EAST WITY NO NOISE,LIGHTS ,VAPER TRAILS NOTHING AT ALL. IT WAS SO SILENT THAT ALTHOUGH IT ONLY ABOUT 300 FEET UP, IF WE HAD`NT BEEN LOOKING FOR METEORS WE WOULD NOT HAVE NOTICED IT AT ALL.WE OBSERVED IT HEADING EAST INTILL WE COULD NOT SEE IT AT ALL.

Thought at first it was a  falling star ???????????????????;2001-01-03 18:45:00;1-2 mins.;Thought at first it was a  falling star ??????????????????? Coming back from a walk with my dog, in front of my house. I thought I saw a falling star!! The next thing I know, this cube ( about 7 inch square)with a comet like tail aprox. 2 feet long, stopped aprox. 15 feet high, in front of me. the cube was bright white but didn't glow.There was no noise,just silence.That night there was a quarter moon and the stars were out. and than it just took off, south.It took off so fast It was mind boggling...It streaked away from me and disapeared. I have been out every night looking and have never seen it again. I have been out walking for 20 years in the same neighborhood and never saw anything like this before.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478

9 People see a red star in the sky at midnite!! - My first sighting please contact;2006-12-05 11:50:00;10~ Minutes;9 People see a red star in the sky at midnite!! - My first sighting please contact Hello This is the 1st time I've ever seen anything like this before.   But let me start by telling you about myself.I live in Fairfield, CA and  I am 19 years old.  The way the sightning began was. I was first driving in my car going home to my apartment around 11:45pm on December 5th 2006 and I saw a red firework go off in the sky toward the Air Base(I actullay have no clue if it was an actual firework It looked like a regular big red firework alot of red little dots in a circle shape). And then the trees blocked my veiw. I immediatly told my girlfriend. She kinda got excited and wanted to see. So I told her toward to look toward Travis(AFB). We hit a couple corners toward the house and had an open view and no fireworks... So we get into my apartment parking lot and shes still looking back for the fireworks. And I notice a red light in the sky straight infront of us while I was driving toward my parking space. My girlfriend tells me... Do you see that? I replyed with a confirmed face and nod. What is that? It looked to be a Red Star very bright. Like a dot or light. I hit a corner in my parking lot and parked to get out to look. There it is... a weird red star looking thing. So I call a homeboy accross town to instruct him to go outside and look toward my apartments. This is around 11:50pm He does and laughs. What is that? No Clue. A red light shining in the sky. Shortly after I called him the red dot started pulsing.. Slowing... But pulsing. Bright and Dim. While I was on the phone with him a white light came from the middle of the red dot and shot BRIGHT real fast and a white line traced down from the bottom. It looked like a white tracer bullet but shot out and only went a very short distance away from the bottom of the red light. I was still on the phone with my homie and he had 3 people with him that all seen it. After the white light shot down, it was once again solid red. I then noticed it was moving down slowly. I got off the phone with my friend and then my girlfriend cal! led her mother. Told her and she had 3 other people with her. We all seen it there are 9 of us in 3 different parts of town. When it dissapered it started moving to the right and then started to pulse faster but still slow.(Maybe  each about 700ms) and then did the same thing the white tracer line thing did and shot down about an inch in my eyes and dimmed away with a consistant pulse. It all happend for about 10 minutes It stopped about midnight to the minute. What I think happend if it was an alien =P. Is that of course they would be smart and they wouldnt go into lightspeed parallel from us. They would go away from us... Please reply!!!1;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
I believe this to be a comet.  It had a blue tail and was yellow and red.  In fact, it reminded me as a diamond in the night sky.;2013-03-03 21:00:00;most of the night;I believe this to be a comet.  It had a blue tail and was yellow and red.  In fact, it reminded me as a diamond in the night sky.  It was beautiful to look at. It was the biggest star out that night.  I watch the night sky alot and I found this 'star' to be different.  I took our binoculors and watched it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
