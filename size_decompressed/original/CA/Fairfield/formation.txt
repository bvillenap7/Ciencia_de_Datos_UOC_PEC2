I SAW ABOUT 8 RED LIGHTS IN A CIRCLE IN THE WESTERN SKY, ABOUT 20 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON, JUST BELOW THE BIG DIPPER.   THE LIGHTS MOVED INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER AND THERE WAS NO NOISE.  ONE BY ONE, THEY FADED AWAY OVER ABOUT 2 MINUTES.   THEN 2 MORE APPEARED TO THE WNW.  THESE 2 LIGHTS SEEMED TO FOLLOW EACH OTHER AND APPEARED TO BE CLOSER (LARGER).   SIZE APPEARED TO BE MUCH LARGER AND BRIGHTER THAN MARS APPEARS TONIGHT.  WE HAVE NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING LIKE THIS!;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
 I glanced up and saw a string formation of lights heading southeast.  ((NUFORC Note:  Cluster of Starlink satellites.  PD));2019-11-11 17:57:00;2 minutes;While sitting the hot tub with my kids, I glanced up and saw a string formation of lights heading southeast. I estimate that they were between 5 and 10 thousand feet in altitude because there was a plane above and to the west of it that was a commercial airliner. The lights were steady and not overly bright.  The lights did not waver but were consistently in line with each other almost as if they were connected.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
