A huge black triangular object was seen slowly traversing across the sky very close at what he estimated to be 900' off the ground.  Th;1999-09-01 21:13:00;3-5 min.;A huge black triangular object was seen slowly traversing across the sky very close at what he estimated to be 900' off the ground.  This object was completely silent, massive and solid in its structure, as the star fields behind it became blocked as it moved along in a slow controlled trajectory. It was 2-3 times the size of a C-5 and it emitted an uncanny 'flame', which was iridescent blue in color, stretched out aprox. 200', and had a sparkly transparency to it. Flame was a term used by him for lack of a better explanation, however he was adamant that this was highly unusual in it appearance, and how it trailed behind the object. Witnesse's mother is vague in her seeing the last few seconds of this, so a strong unrelated secondary witness was found. I believe this to be a very significant event in the September 1st wave.  Full detailed report to be found at http://psi-app.com/SeptSightingA.htm Eyewitness was a 13 year old boy, whom drew a sketch of the object.  Mother witnessed last few seconds of this event.  Subsequently an article was ran in our local paper and a very strong unrelated secondary witness came forward.  This witness just happens to be a news paper reporter for another paper.  A full detailed report, with sketch, news article, and other witnesses report can be viewed at http://((URL deleted));38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
Triangular craft hovering over highway;2005-10-31 20:00:00;20 seconds;Triangular craft hovering over highway My wife and I were driving westbound on I-80 between Vacaville and Fairfield California Halloween night.  My wife was driving, I was sitting in the back seat driver side of the car next to my infant son's car seat. I noticed 2 flashing white lights approaching us in the sky from the west.  We are next to a military base and see plane's lights in the sky all the time.   I'm an aircraft enthusiast and can make out aircraft by their lights at night.   At first I thought these were wingtip lights of an approaching plane, but these lights were flashing much faster than an aircraft's lights (almost like strobe lights) and not in the same pattern.  I also caught glimpse of a red light between the two white lights, but it was hard to make out with the rapid strobing.   My wife, who is not an enthusiast, even recognized it as something strange and said,What is that?  The two lights approached the highway and then came to a hover, not directly over it, but near it.  It was at an altitude of perhaps 500-750 feet.  I was still trying to figure out what it was, and said I thought it might be a helicopter, but I had seen helicopters at night, also, and this was not one.   We were still heading toward the craft and as we passed to the side and under it, another light came into view and it was recognizable as a triangular shape craft with a white light at each point.  The red light I had mentioned earlier was not at the center of the points, it was just blackness in the middle, so it must have been on the one side.   As we passed by it, I got a sort of panoramic view of the light formation and could approximate it's size to be that of slightly larger than the rotor radius of a newscopter type helicopter.  I wish we had stopped, but we didn't as the highway was busy, and it went out of view behind us.  With the amount of traffic on the road, there should be atleast a few hundred more witnesses to this.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
Boomerang UFO;2010-05-09 22:00:00;35 s;Boomerang UFO I saw a boomerang shaped object fly toward the direction of Travis air force base. The object looked identical to the one depicted in an episode of UFO Hunters on the History channel entitled First Repsonse.  In that episode a segment aired in which a man from Lake Havasu, NV, reported a boomerang shape craft.  This sparked my memory due to the visual depiction on TV.  Also the object emitted no sound as it traveled overhead. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478

Awoke with triangle marks on my body, twice. 2nd time, felt a pinch in my rib and passed out, awoke with second one in area of pinch.;2018-09-12 00:00:00;Unknown;Awoke with triangle marks on my body, twice. 2nd time, felt a pinch in my rib and passed out, awoke with second one in area of pinch. Hello! I recently experienced an extraterrestrial event that was not a UFO, but could have been alien activity. I was doing research on Malaysia Flight 370 and was piecing things together with a few friends (such as the fact they are not human was said in the blackbox recording and the plane had simply disappeared). I was extremely tired so I had decided to put my computer down and to go to sleep. I fell asleep and the next morning I woke up and saw a triangle mark on my right thigh.  I sent an image to my friend, she saw it immediately in the photo replying what ((two words deleted)) is that, you probably got abducted.  That hadn't even crossed my mind.  Then I was thinking about the research me and my friends had done the night before involving the sentence they are not human.  This seemed very stupid to me and I was thinking I had just overthought the situation. A few nights later, I felt a pinch on my rib, and immediately passed out (it happened fast and I had no intention of falling asleep, but woke up the next morning). The area on my rib that felt pinched the night before felt extremely bruised.  I looked at it to notice that it was a triangle mark, and hurt extremely worse than the one on my thigh.  I do not have a picture of this one. Long story short, I woke up with triangle marks on my body,  TWICE.  My orange tabby also kept biting at the marks, which he never bites me.
