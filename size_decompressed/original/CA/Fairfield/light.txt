I noticed a white light moving south in the night sky. It seemed low, crossing the paths of the stars above it.It made no sounds at all. My friend saw it,too, as we were discussing the strange object. After about 3 minutes of steady speed, it quickly went from white to yellow to red and totally disappeared.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
((NUFORC Note:  Moving star turned bright bright blue and traveled at a fast pace.;2005-07-15 03:00:00;2 minutes;Moving star turned bright bright blue and traveled at a fast pace. The object looked like a star but was moving across the sky at a semi-fast pace. Once it reached the constellation  Lynx, the moving star started to turn bright, bright blue.  Slowly it faded back to original color, through binoculars it just look like a moving star. It seemed to be going farther up because it faded and went to far for  the eyes to see.  Two women witnessed the UFO. It didn't look like a comet, the women star-gaze everynight.

red light over Suisun City, Ca seen from Fairfield, Ca;2006-07-01 23:00:00;<5 minutes;red light over Suisun City, Ca seen from Fairfield, Ca At around 11PM on the 1st, I was sitting in my backyard smoking a cigarette when I saw a bright red light come over my neighbors house roughly paralleling the flight path of commercial aircraft heading east from the bay area.  It appeared to be travelling in a slight zig-zag pattern and then stopped and hovered, I estimate between 5-10 miles away.   Shortly thereafter, a jet aircraft appeared moving very quickly and I believed that this might be an investigating fighter because of its speed but it continued right on past the red object. It was, I should point out, flying both higher and further away than the object. Within a matter of seconds of this passing, the object descended in a straight line below the trees in the neighborhood and out of sight. I grabbed my video recorder, jumped in my car and headed in that direction but did not find this object again. I have either been an AIr Force brat or active duty myself for all of my 45 years, I believe I know an airplane or helicopter when I see one. And I have seen aircraft on fire with my own two eyes this object was not on fire. The number of witnesses should be substantial because this siting was near a freeway (I80)which I think westbound must have been pointing almost, if not directly at the object. Highway 12 is also heavily travelled and is about 2 miles closer to the object than I was with nothing but virtually roadless/lightless swamp to its west. This thing was bright it had to have been noticed.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
Groups of strange orange lights seen over Fairfield, CA at 20:00 on 3-21-15.;2015-03-21 20:00:00;~20 minutes;Groups of strange orange lights seen over Fairfield, CA at 20:00 on 3-21-15 I was traveling east on hi 80 and noticed 20-40 bright orange lights in different formations to the east.   I pulled over as soon as possible but by then a lot had disappeared, but still about 6-10 were visible.   I took a video with my cell phone but they didn't turn out great but are still visible crossing the sky.  There was no apparent pattern and was certainly NOT one object.  They would come from what is approximately Travis AFB, and travel slowly across the sky, and then just fade away.   Then a new group would come from the south and repeat the above.   Interestingly, I appeared to be the only one looking at this phenomenon.  I google with my cell phone and found that approximately March 15, 2013, someone took a video which pretty much looked like what I saw.  Someone gave the opinion on this site that they were “lanterns”;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
Bluish tail mist.   ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:00:00;10 minutes;Bluish tail mist ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD)) Bright light was traveling from the southeast to northwest with a bluish mist or tail behind it that was really long.  Then the object started a fan shaped contrail with the same bluish mist that spread out over a huge area that tapered off to a point behind the object.  The bluish mist stopped suddenly but you could still see the straight tail and the fanning out of the mist.  The object kept going in a straight line and it seemed to be really high in the sky, at the very least in the 10's of miles up.  After watching it for a few min it seemed to shroud itself in a mist again but not as much as before.  It traveled that way for about 2 more min then it looked like it shot another tail of mist in front of it, kind of looked like a comet at that point, but it was in front of the object.  Meaning it was traveling towards the tail it was shooting out.  After another min it shot a tail out behind it while at the same time still had the tail in front of it.  You! could clearly see the object in the middle of the 2 tails.  After a few more min both tails vanished and the object was shrouded in a hazy mist at this time and continued on until it faded from sight. I'm sure there will be reports on this but I haven't seen any yet.  The initial bluish mist took up a very large portion of the sky.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
