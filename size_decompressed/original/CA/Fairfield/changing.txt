Comet-like light in the western sky, traveling south to north.  ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 17:55:00;15 minutes;Comet-like light in the western sky, traveling south to north. A little before 6pm tonight, to the West, Southwest, about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It looked like a comet at first, with the tail pointing down to the right, but it traveled very slowly to the North, lasting 10 to 15 minutes before it moved out of my sight.  At times it broke into several white lights, almost a vertical streak of light with two or three white lights that fluctuated in brightness.  To the south was a horizontal streak of blue light.

11/29/2016, Fairfield, CA, large floating object moving west to east, early evening.;2016-11-29 19:45:00;60 seconds;11/29/2016, Fairfield, CA, large floating object moving west to east, early evening Fairfield is the home to Travis Air Force Base.  Around 7 pm on 11/29/2016, I saw a large airplane making a steep banked turn.  A few minutes later I saw what I thought was a smaller plane doing the same, only less banked.  What struck me as unusual was the steep angle of the banking and the low position to the ground. Approximately an hour later, I’m standing outside in Fairfield, CA, having a smoke when I saw what I thought was a boomerang-shaped flock of white birds flying east over Suisun Bay.  As they moved east, over Fairfield, it looked more like a giant scarf floating on the wind.  As I discounted the scarf theory, and wondered what it could be, it looked more like a giant dark bird flying in a V shape.  Only the size was too big to be any bird.  Some stars were visible and I could make out the ‘wing’ eclipse one of the stars.  As it traveled east, it blended into the dark sky. There were no lights or sounds coming from that direction, and the breeze was minimal.  I watched it glide by for over a minute.  At times it reminded me of a 30-foot piece of fabric floating in the air.  As it passed by (at a 40 degree angle from where I was standing), it was larger, darker, and more v-shaped … if it was closer I would have guessed it was a bird gliding by with wings in a ‘v’ shape.  But it was LARGE, and quiet.  There were no airplane noises or anything.  It continued east until I couldn’t see it for the darkness of the sky.  It did not appear to head towards Travis AFB to the south, but rather towards Vacaville to the east. Surely someone else saw it.  What was it?;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
