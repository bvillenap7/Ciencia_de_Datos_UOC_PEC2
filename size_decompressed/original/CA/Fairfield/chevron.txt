not sure what this is;2011-10-23 00:00:00;3 and 1 half seconds;not sure what this is Sunday night on my patio the kids set up a projector to show a movie on a white sheet and shortly after it started I noticed to the north these golden sparkles that were in the air maybe 20 yards away that came together and formed a chevron shape and it was about a foot in diaminter and it came at me so fast, came within 10 feet of me and did a u turn and flew over my house and went behind a tree and we saw a light explode behind the tree or something happened that lit up behind the tree. My 10 year old granddaughter saw it once it was making the u turn and went over the house and my grandson saw it light up behind the tree. I actually saw it forming from the golden sparkels and when when it was coming at me I jumped out of my chair and said what the f was that.  I told James Gilligland about it and he thinks it was an ultradimenisional being,  I think so too. I don't know if it was a ufo but I have seen a few of those to.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
Small, still, V-shaped UFO.;2016-08-12 20:00:00;30 seconds;Small, still, V-shaped UFO. V shaped aircraft off I-80.  Extremely still and unmoving.  Also very small looked like a smal drone but definitely visible were two white lights and a black disc underneath it with a ring of blue dim lights.  Surprised with how still it was because I saw it about .25 mi away approaches it to get a good look and drove right past it;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
