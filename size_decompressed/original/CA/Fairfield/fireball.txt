Large fireball moving slowly,  horizonally,  very low in the sky, lighting up everything for miles around.;1972-06-30 00:00:00;3 minutes;Large fireball moving slowly,  horizonally,  very low in the sky, lighting up everything for miles around. I was living in Pleasant Hill, CA. I was about 24 years old then.  I had my two babies sleeping in the back seat as I was driving home from Sacramento very late. At that time I was the only one on the road. This road was Hwy 780. It cuts off from 80 to 680.  There are no lights along that road. To my right there was a cut away in the hill so that I couldn't see to my right. On the left was a very large marshy meadow. In the distance were many homes. It is impossible to see the homes in the dark from there.  As I was driving along suddenly the sky from above me lite up like it was flood lights right on me (almost like daylight). It really startled me.  I looked to see where it was coming from and finally saw this huge ball of fire about 50' above moving horizonally over my head from my right to my left and out across the meadow lighting up everything in its wake.  I could see the entire meadow and the houses in the distance. It wasn't going very fast. It wasn't falling.  I didn't stop to watch it any longer as it was really scareing me.  If it happened today. I would have stopped on a dime to watch it.   I did't see what happened to it after I watched it move over the houses.  The ball of fire was probably about 20 to 30 feet in diameter. I only watched for about 3 minutes. It looked just like fire. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.

It stayed in the sky for a very lenghty amount of time( long enough for me to loose interest). Later that nite either the same object or an identical one (also sharing the odd manuverabilities as the one just discribed) was in the South sky, moving very slowly than dissappearing. A very bright light that glowed a bright red to a very vivid golden yellow color, even an almost white light. Displayed brief instances(lasting anywhere from 45sec. to approx. 1 minute) of intense brightness, than would suddenly fade very dim, to the point that it would appear to be a distant star. It would stay stationary for lenghts of time, than would move very slowly from side to side and at one point even disappeared briefly just at the edge of the the hills, than suddenly appeared again. At around 2am (2nd sighting) the object displayed all the chararistics as just discribed, but after several minutes of watching it, it suddenly just disappeared. An interesting note during the second sighting there was an aircraft in the very same vacinity as the ufo during that time, in fact the air craft flew extremely close to the object, but didn't show any unusal interest in the object. The 2nd sighting I wittnessed alone, where as the 1st sighting was observed by my boyfriend.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
2 fire balls in the sky, apparently communicating with each other;2000-09-19 04:20:00;3 minutes;2 fire balls in the sky, apparently communicating with each other On 9/19/00 at 4:20 am my friend and I pulled into the parking lot at work and we both saw 2 really big balls of fire in the sky. The first ball of fire went back to the second ball of fire and touched it, as to say to it,Come on. The first ball of fire proceeded to move to the east, the second ball of fire tried to move, but seemed to have a hard time, then it got to moving toward the first ball as the first ball was moving east. The second ball had sparks falling down from it, and then they both disappeared into the dark sky.The background of the sky was clear and dark with no clouds, we could clearly see the stars.  Our location is about 50 miles north of San Francisco. ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to obtain reports from other witnesses.  PD));38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478

Just before it disappeared behind the mountains between Fairfield and Napa, it appeared to burst into flames.  Then it disappeared from my view.

Large craft chases smaller craft;2016-12-17 00:08:00;4;Large craft chases smaller craft Above the north-eastern horizon, my husband and I witnessed a bright craft jetting straight upward into the sky.  As it was halfway into the sky, another smaller jet type  of craft appeared above the brighter one below. When it appeared, the brighter object started chasing the smaller object, then the smaller object appeared to shoot out deflector projectiles that exploded on the larger object below.  The bigger object was not phased by the smaller objects projectiles and continued to persue the smaller object until both were above the atmosphere and out of sight.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
