On Wednesday, February 8, 2006 at 22:08, I, along with two others, saw what I thought was an airplane but it had no flashing lights as well as no sound. Instead of flashing lights, there was what appeared to be long, stringy, sparks dripping from underneath the object. The object was about half the size of a full moon. It also had what appeared to be brown flood lights all around and shining forward. It appeared to be moving slower than an airplane and it was visible for about two minutes. As it moved towards the west, the lights started flashing and they went out one by one until it was totally dark. The sparks stopped before the lights started flashing. After the lights went out, there was a dim egg shaped glow that still appeared until the object disappeared in the night sky traveling east to west.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
