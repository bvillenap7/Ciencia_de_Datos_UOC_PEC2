This object was perfectly round unlike a ball, and was black .. it made no sound nor had any lights illuminating it ... At first i thought it was a hot air balloon, but realized a balloon could not possibly go as fast as this object did .. I called my Mom and she also witnessed it, we watched in awe, till it disappeared behind the neighbors trees .. We then went into the street to look for it, but it was gone ... Entire event was less than 2 minutes;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478

First it is important to mention my friend her husband and their 2 kids had been seeing this same craft, and others for a while, I just never thought it was true, and I thought how could good parents bring their kids into this strange stuff.   It happened like this for me,  I was taking that very friend home from work at about 10pm we picked up 1 of her kids from the sitters house, we pulled up in her drive way, and she was standing out side the drivers door talking to me, then she pointed across the way and said look there's one.  I thought it looked like an airplane with two small lights coming near, I thought she just wanted me to sit with her, and talk I said it's an airplane, and I need to get home it was very cold, and my heater in the car had not worked for at least 2 years no matter how much money we put into the car it just would not work, even letting it ilde for an hour never helped the heater.  I decided to please her and get out to at least look. I left the car to idle, I walked about 8 steps and I saw the lights get closer still thinking it was an airplane (mind you I lived just out the gates of NAS pensacola for 3 years, I watched many night flights of many planes including a stealth in hover, so I feel that I can not be fooled by this.)  It came just a block away from where I was standing,  It became huge it looked like the shape of the sun from a distance it was completely round, and was extremely bright like the sun with a white glow, then it made a swift turn, one side to the other like opening up.  You could still see the size, I saw the center up and down was black and it still glowed on the right and left side.  It then began to drop stuff from the bottom (although there  was a black space between the circle and the stuff coming out, glowing like gold particules.  I was so intent on seeing the stuff falling, and the fact that it was right above the Fairfield school district concerned me.  What was it dropping?  I thought, then in a matter of seconds it stopped dropping the stuff, I looked up a little, and it was GONE.  I returned to my car in what seemd like 3 to 5 mins. and the heater in the car was working great it worked for 2 more days and stopped. After this I litterally sat on my roof looking for these things, and from a distance I did see them again twice. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Large amber colored orb by Travis Airforce base CA;2011-08-13 00:45:00;5 min;Large amber colored orb by Travis Airforce base CA The object came up over the appartment complex as if it had been flying low over the city. It then shot down a few hundred feet in a fraction of a second and then went back up just as fast.  It was an amber colored orb.   It then leveled out and went straight across the sky for a minute or two and then shot staight up into the sky and was gone.   I know it wasn't a plane or jet because tere was no sound at all. We live near the travis air force base and I've seen and heard plenty of jets and planes.  I strongly believe it was checking out the air base.  The person I had seen it with is in denile as to what we saw because he more scaired then anything.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
