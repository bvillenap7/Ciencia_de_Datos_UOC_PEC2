Single bright light that moved like no airplane i have ever seen before;2003-07-29 01:22:00;1 hr and going;Single bright light that moved like no airplane i have ever seen before i happened to look outside my window into the sky and noticed a bright star and i thought it move. so i got up and moved closer to the window and watched this star for 2 minutes and continually saw this star move in very odd ways. i then went and got my mother and my partner tio see if they could see this start moving as well.  We watched it for a minute and they could see the same thing that i was....this object was moving. My sister and her friend then joined in watching this object. This object moved up and down, from left to right & right to left and in zigzagging moves. I have seen satellites and planets in the night sky before and I know what they look like.  This star is not either of those.  It is now 131 am and i have been watching this object since 1220am.  This star is still moving same patterns. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the object was a celestial body, either a star or planet.  The perceived motion of the bright object against a dark background is often reported by witnesses, and it is the result of movement of the eye, not the object being observed.  It is called nystagmic movement of the eye, we believe.  PD));38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478

Gliding green light seen over Fairfield, CA sky on 5/6/10, 23:23...turned yellow as it continued its course out of sight.;2010-05-06 23:23:00;1-2 min;Gliding green light seen over Fairfield, CA sky on 5/6/10, 23:23...turned yellow as it continued its course out of sight. I was sitting in my car waiting for a friend curbside outside a corner house. I witnessed an aircraft gliding across the sky NW to SE in Fairfield, CA. Aircraft caught my full attention when all I noticed was a green light that glowed from it, nothing blinking as is the norm for flying planes. The aircraft continued along it's path and as it passed overhead, the color of the glowing light changed to yellow and stayed that color as it continued along its course and eventually out of sight. This area is near a military base and several other aircraft (actual planes) can be seen in the distance with their blinking lights. This aircraft was unlike the others as it appeared to be a gliding light, not once blinking as the others in the distant sky did.

Solid green light spotted dancing in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-06-16 23:00:00;3 minutes;Solid green light spotted dancing in the sky. While letting my dog outside, I noticed a green light hovering in the sky to the southwest.  I watched it for a minute, wondering if maybe it was a plane.  But it just stayed in the same spot, so it couldn't have been a plane.  Plus the light was solid and not blinking.   After a minute I realized I left my phone in the house.  So, I ran inside and grabbed it and started to record footage.  Keep in mind, it's night outside and I'm using a phone for video.  It was hard to keep it steady due to the zoom level that I used on top of it being on the completely black background of the sky.   It was making strange sideways and up and down motions, which is hard to tell on the video due to a lack of reference.  I watched it for another 2 minutes then went inside to grab a witness.  By the time we got back outside it was gone.  I also realize for some reason the phone did not capture the green of it that I saw.  The green that I saw was as green as a green traffic light.  I would estimate its height at around 6000 feet and around 5-6 miles from me.  The blinking in the video was when it would go behind a power line.

There was a pulsing and rotating low noise coming from the clouds for over twenty minutes.;2019-04-01 01:55:00;20 minutes;There was a pulsing and rotating low noise coming from the clouds for over twenty minutes.  The noise did not move from the direction it was coming from and stopped complety afterwards with no fading out.   The sky was dark and cloudy, so I could not see what was making the constant, very low, spinning noise.;38.2586364779873;-122.08063836478
