Greenish glowing craft flies over Peninsula Bayland/Palo Alto area;2003-03-10 01:45:00;less than 5 seconds;Greenish glowing craft flies over Peninsula Bayland/Palo Alto area Sighting occurred at 01:45 on 3/10/03 I was awake and looking out the bedroom window with an unobstructed view of the night sky towards the NE. Suddenly, there appeared this strange craft, (I swear it had the appearance of  NCG-1701 'Star Trek'). I say suddenly because 'poof' - there it was where there had just been empty night sky. The ship's forward area (the round construction) was glowing a fuzzy lime green, while the rest of the ship seemed dark - that is, no lights were noticed on the periphery. I would estimate that the size of this thing was very large, in that if  I held my hand at arm's length, the object would almost have filled in the space of 4 fingers (thumb tucked). Unfortunately, the sighting lasted for less than 5 seconds because it just as suddenly disappeared -- 'poof'-- again. The craft flew in a northerly direction (direction San Francisco) extremely fast, faster than a normal jet on approach to SFO. I would estimate that this craft was approximately 6-8 miles away, and flying between 3,000 to 5,000 feet over the baylands or Bay. I have a good feel for this as we live on the flight path into SFO, on what the controllers call the Peninsula approach. That is, jets are vectored over the Peninsula from the SW, flying over Palo Alto at between 3K-5K feet. However, after 11:00 pm, jets usually vector out over the Bay, staying away from the Peninsula area.  (See http://www.uproar.org/cached/SFChron.8.6.98.html for the whole article.) I thought later that the green I saw on the craft might have been regular starboard/port side lights, but that made no sense as the side that was facing me was the left of the craft (I assume) and therefore the light should have been red. But in any case, the fuzzy greenish light enveloped the whole front section of the craft's construction - the round part. Career wise, I am a professional secretary and hobby wise, a percussionist. I am trained to observe and memorize details. I hope that other people on the Peninsula saw this brief passing of the strange greenish glowing craft and will report it as well. No need to contact me. Thank you.;37.3668265060241;-122.099477108434
glowing horizontal saucer-shaped light seen hovering over Los Altos Hills, CA.;2009-07-18 03:00:00;3 minutes;glowing horizontal saucer-shaped light seen hovering over Los Altos Hills, CA. It was early in the morning on July 18, 2009 in Los Altos Hills when I spotted the UFO.  From our car, one passenger and myself spotted a glowing light in the sky.  It was a long horizontal band of light that looked to be spinning.  It hovered in the air a few miles away from where we were parked in the hills and looked as if it was levitating.  It was a fairly bright saucer-shaped light that seemed to accelerate and get smaller before completely disappearing into the night sky.   The entire episode lasted about 3-4 minutes and we could not think of any logical explanation for the unique shape and characteristics of the lights.;37.3668265060241;-122.099477108434
