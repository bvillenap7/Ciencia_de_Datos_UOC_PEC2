During lightning storm and early morning hours (still dark)an object with lights stayed motionless in the same area.;1999-09-09 05:00:00;30 minutes +;During lightning storm and early morning hours (still dark)an object with lights stayed motionless in the same area. At around 5:00 AM in the morning myself and a neighbor were outside talking of the unusual electrical storm and noticed an object which at first we thought was an airplane but noticed that it was not moving. We could not see the shape of the object for two reasons. 1)it was still dark outside, 2)it had lights which was bright enough to mask any shape. At first glance it appeared to be an airplane as far as the front lights were same as you see from an aircraft at night. We noticed the object was not moving and made no sound as a helicoper may have made so we came to the conclusion that this object was not an airplane nor a helicoper. It stayed in one place with the airplane like headlights and no other lights visible. The object appeared to be roundish although a definite shape was not apparent and we could not see any extensions, such as wings etc. After about 30 minutes or so we had to leave for work and was unable to continue our observations. If you need any other Info. you can contact me at <gee_4orce@hotmail.com>. My name is Terry Woods. I am now a believer that we are visited by aliens or that our government has experimental space crafts. After the observation described above I have no explanation as to what it could have been but I do know that what we saw was clearly a craft and not a conventional airplane of any type I have seen in my lifetime. Also it was close enough that it was obviously not a star and did not move like one of our satellites would. Thanks!  (Name deletesd));37.3668265060241;-122.099477108434
