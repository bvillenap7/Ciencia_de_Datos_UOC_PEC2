a grouping of white lights surrounded by haze, floodlight shining down, no sound;1990-03-15 22:00:00;@ 5 minutes;a grouping of white lights surrounded by haze, floodlight shining down, no sound On a beautiful, clear spring evening, I went for a walk from my residence in Los Altos, Ca., over to Sunnyvale. At that time, when I lived in California, I was hiking between 25 and 35 miles each week, both after work and in the evenings. I was returning home from my walk, and was within one mile from my house, and cut across a supermarket parking lot. The supermarket had closed for the evening, the lights were being turned out, and there were only a few cars left in the lot. As I crossed the lot, I looked up at approximately a 30 degree angle, and noticed a tight grouping of 5 or 6 white lights with a floodlight shining down. There was a mist or haze surrounding the grouping of lights, which were in a non-descript pattern on this object.My first observation of this object would indicate that it was a helicopter with a searchlight shining down. I quickly realized, however, that the object was at a close proximity approximately one third to one half a mile away, and there was no sound audible from the object. The object was completely motionless. I realized that a helicopter hovering at that close proximity would be distinctly audible.As I watched the object, a person was walking to their car across the parking lot. I was just about to call out to that person to call their attention to the object, when;37.3668265060241;-122.099477108434
Swarm of ufos over Los Altos.;2017-11-17 11:20:00;2 minutes;Swarm of ufos over Los Altos Walking down my driveway, facing N/nw, I just happened to look up and saw what I thought was a large flock of birds circling, but seemed very high I could not make out size or type of bird.  Than I began to notice that they would go from a dark to light color, but it was not reflective of sun, most of group was circling clockwise, but either side would turn whitish, not just group at “9 o’clock” position as if that how angled in turn, the 3 o’clock side would also go white.   I pulled out my phone to record, and continued watching and the objects were fading in/out, then after about 2 minutes they all vanished.  I went to watch the video and stupid me didn’t record!!!  I did see a very high altitude plane fly over, maybe over 20,000 ft (lots of planes fly over to sfo, that pattern puts at 6000 over my house, so this plane much higher) but the object were definitely below this plane.;37.3668265060241;-122.099477108434
