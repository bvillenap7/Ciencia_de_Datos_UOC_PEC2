Panoche Experience three lights three crafts three witnesses;2006-08-26 02:00:00;3 min;Panoche Experience three lights three crafts three witnesses While driving north on I-5 near Panoche Rd my friends and I noticed a craft approaching us from the north east at a low elevation it had three large white lights under the craft that turned on and off. I could see the glow from the heat when the lights turned off. I also looked under the craft briefly as it passed over us, it didn't have any characteristics of a helicopter nor any sound for being so close to our car. A couple more started circling around us while one got behind us and followed us for a awhile. The driver thought we were getting pulled over for a second because the lights were so bright and were at the same level of our car.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
Two aircraft looked like they were gonna collide and after passing there were 3 or 4.;2011-02-18 17:03:00;3 minutes;Two aircraft looked like they were gonna collide and after passing there were 3 or 4. At about 5:03pm today Feb 18, 2011, I looked up into the sky facing west and I saw 2 seemingly to me jet aircraft heading towards each other.  One was heading east and one was heading west.   The aircraft that had 4 vapor trails was heading east. The aircraft that was heading west had 2 vapor trails. Both aircraft looked like they were heading for a collision when the east bound aircraft seemingly pulled up and appeared to have dropped something.  The west bound aircraft seemingly maintained its course and dropped something as well.  The aircraft that was heading east seemed to have accelerated significantly. It appeared that both items dropped had vapor trails and started heading east.  My dad came outside and saw 3 aircraftâ€™s vapor trails 2 heading west and one heading east.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
