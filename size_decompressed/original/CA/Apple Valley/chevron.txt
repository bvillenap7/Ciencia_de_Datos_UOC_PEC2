Reflected Impulse in desert sky.;2002-03-29 15:00:00;20seconds;Reflected Impulse in desert sky. My son and I were heading south on Kiowa road around 2:45-3:00 pm,still plenty of daylight.I had an urge to look up in the sky.The reflection,like from a mirror in the sun caught my eye. The craft was cheveron shaped, light in color.The top was more of a white color and the bottom portion was  metal, shinny. I told my son to look as I also said it is a UFO.Look at it it has to be, the shape isnt like a plane.Then it just vanished.I asked my son,ok if it wasnt , then where did it go?;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
