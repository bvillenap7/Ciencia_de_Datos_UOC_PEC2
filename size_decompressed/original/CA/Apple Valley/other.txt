No lights or windows were visable.VERY LARGE! Witnesses observed very large manta-ray shaped object approximately  7 - 8 miles away move slowly west over a mountain range. The object was larger than blimp size and was solid black with no reflective surfaces. Observer 1 ( writing this summary ) huried into house a got a pair of binoculars ( 10x50 ) and observed the object for a couple of minutes. I then proceeded to locate our 35mm camera and snap off 6 pictures. Unfortunately when I went to rewind the film for developing it was no longer in the camera and is still missing. The first thing I did when I picked up the camera was to look through the little window to see the type of film and number of exposures on it ( 200 ASA 24 exp ) I then looked at how many exposures were left ( all 24 ) and proceede to the back porch to take my 6 photos. What happened to the film is still a mystery, but this object was a very symetrical structured craft that was so black it looked like a hole in the sky. There were no lights or windows visable.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
The object was turning I could se a visible trail or tail when it vanished from the sky.;2002-05-04 15:30:00;40 sec;The object was turning I could se a visible trail or tail when it vanished from the sky. I saw one object in the distant dark morning sky it looked like a large red glow(like fire or flames)from each side of the object which was coming towards us from the south west sky then turned south for a few seconds and then then as it turned west the red glow intesified and while it was turning I could see a trail or something like a slide show viewed in sections like a trail as it was turning it completly vanished with no visible evidence it had exsisted.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
Report of red lights in sky with vivid accurate discriptions and pictures of objects.;2013-02-03 20:15:00;3-5 minutes;Report of red lights in sky with vivid accurate discriptions and pictures of objects. the night of Feb 3rd 2013 after watching the super bowl (alone did not have anything to drink)  I was leaving my apartment to go to my office and get a file for an appointment I had the next morning. As I am leaving the driveway I see a large red light in the sky to the south east. I think to myself this is probably mars.  Mars behind some thin clouds as it also had a red glow I was assuming from shining through clouds.  It seemed too big to me to be Mars but I was still going with that notion until it moved. Some background about me. I am an avid aviation person. I have my own aviation website. I am a student pilot and have soloed.  I have served in the Air Force and have 20/25 vision.  Better than average. I can tell you what an aircraft is from a distance of miles and my head always turns to the sky when I see something (anything) flying.  I keep a pair of binoculars in the car and pull over when I see something I want to check out further. This night when I headed out the driveway I stopped when I saw the red light. I got out of the car with my binoculars and began watching. As I am watching the object faded out as if it went further into a cloud and just got swallowed up.  I have seen that with aircraft before.  As I took my binoculars from my eyes I instantly saw out of my peripheral the same object or one like it. This time it was east about 100 degrees.  This time it seemed closer and had the same red center and red glow but this time it had a short searchlight about 35 degrees wide.  Again I thought it’s in clouds and the searchlight must be hitting the outer edges thus stopping and not going to infinity.  The searchlight was panning up and down and in every direction and seemed to me at least from my vantage point to be on a single plain, as in it wasn’t round it was a flattened light.  During this time the object/craft is moving a short distance in its general area.  Not hovering but not really covering any g! round just staying in a relative position in the sky.  I realized then that there was not a cloud in the sky.  None just clear sky and stars…   I decided I needed a witness so I was going to call my friend and get him to look outside.  Instead I decided even if I got him on the phone he may not get out of wherever he was as see it in time so I decided to take my phone and take pictures instead…  I got 4 good pictures at full zoom… With each picture I am watching the craft in between shots as what I see in the view finder is a speck compared to what I actually see with my eye.  After the fourth Picture I pulled the camera/phone away from my face and see it is shooting down towards the ground it seems slow and takes about 10 seconds but the distance it went was a good distance across the sky so I know it was much faster than it seemed.  An aircraft such as a Cessna could not cover that much ground that fast, and also do the slow hovering it had been doing…  The craft shot to the ground and left a trail or light path of dashed lines to the ground I looked at the pictures after it was too low to the ground and had passed behind trees and houses.  I did not realize I caught this on camera.  I at first thought image 4 was a blur because I moved the camera.  Upon examination and thinking about it. I had captured the first part of the shooting towards the ground.  I realized this because there were 2 objects in the picture.  One blurred and one not blurred.  If I had moved the camera then both objects would have blurred. There is definite shape to the second object and with enhancement it becomes much clearer. The other 3 images the craft were centered and the pictures came out with one image containing 2 craft. I only saw one craft with my eyes but 2 are visible in the pictures. What I saw with my eye and what the eye of the camera saw were different. My eye sees subtle things like a glow while the camera picks up things fainter than I can see. Together they paint a picture of a craft I do not have knowledge of and cannot explain.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066

They were;2020-01-12 06:45:00;45 seconds;Traveling West on Hwy 18 between 7th St and the 15 Fwy 2 hexagon shaped objects appeared at cloud level pointed South bound. They were dark colored but transluscent. It seem like the were behind a sheer cloud cover. There were no lights. One object was flying on it’s side like a flounder and the other one was flying flat. They hovered over the 15 Fwy and Hwy 18 for about 40 to 45 seconds. The one flying on it’s side was in front and the other one was hovering right over the back of the one in front and did a tight circle around the one in front. They appeared out now where and disappeard the same way.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
