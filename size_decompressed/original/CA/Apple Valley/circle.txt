red ufo with light beam;2011-07-16 22:30:00;15 seconds;red ufo with light beam There was a red light behind some trees, it looked to be maybe 6 miles away from where we were.  Then out of nowhere the red light turned yellow on the outside, then the yellow light surrounding the red light began to fall like if it was melting and the yellow light along with red light began to loose elevation and we no longer could see it.  10 min after the event we went inside and at around 11:00pm there was more than 4 helicopters circulling the area.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066

Mysterious bright orange ball of light glides across high desert sky Easter Sunday evening.;2014-04-20 20:30:00;3-4 minutes;Mysterious bright orange ball of light glides across high desert sky Easter Sunday evening Easter night, clear skies, no wind. Noticed a bright orange light moving across the sky.  There were several planes visible during this time too that were much smaller dots in the sky with blinking lights as you'd expect to see on aircraft.  I'm also familiar with what satellites look like too.  This orange light was a solid light that almost seemed to twinkle as it moved across the sky toward the south.  Much bigger in size than the surrounding aircraft flying in the vicinity, but still obviously distant in the clear sky.  After watching it move in awe trying to run to every rational checklist I could think of for about 3-4 minutes it just suddenly disappeared.  Like the bright orange light had been flicked off like a light switch.   My son witnessed this first event with me.  I told my husband as we loaded our kids in our separate vehicles, after visiting family for Easter.  He had just missed the sight and blew me off when I told him I couldn't logically explain wh! at I had just seen.   We drove around the corner approx 1/4 mi. to our home.  As we both pulled our vehicles in the driveway I noticed the bright orange light again!  It was back to the north of us again moving in the same direction the other light had.   This time my husband saw it too. We stood in our street watching this mysterious light move silently to the south for just under 5 minutes. Just like before it seemed to suddenly disappear.  My husband told me he was sorry for not taking me seriously the first time for he too could offer no plausible explanation.   We waited about another 10 min outside scanning the sky and only saw the obvious aircraft and stars in the sky.  Then I spent 15 min. inside trying to assure my son it was a balloon or something, because he was very unsettled about the sighting.  I did not want him to worry so I fibbed and told him it was probably blown away from a nearby business.   I couldn't convince myself though because the object was way too bright to be a balloon, or a candle inside a plastic bag as my mom suggested wh en I called her and told her what we saw.  And why the twinkling effect then?  Was it surrounded by a material that bends light as it emits or passes thru the object?   I'm convinced this is not a case of mistaken identity. Something weird and curious passed thru the high desert sky tonight.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
