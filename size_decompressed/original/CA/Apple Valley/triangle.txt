Three bright lights moving in a triangular pattern and then seperating;1986-07-23 19:00:00;:20 min;Three bright lights moving in a triangular pattern and then seperating One summer evening when I was around twelve years old I observed what appeared to be three bright lights moving in the sky.   At first these lights seemed to move together in triangular formation, but then would seperate and move in impossisble geometrical patterns.  The lights did not appear to change color and made no sound.  Excited about what I was seeing I ran to get a friend of mine and he also observed the same strange lights moving in the sky.   My friend suggested that I get my binoculars and when I came back he said the lights had just shot off. Not long after observing the lights a helicopter appeared circling the area.

2 silent triangle crafts;2009-05-12 20:36:00;3 Minutes;2 silent triangle crafts I was driving home on Yucaloma Rd, when I looked in the sky and saw 6 very bright lights. I pulled the car over and me and the passenger watched as the lights floated silently fairly close to the ground. The lights, which originally were 4 in a string, and two more off to the side, suddenly became 3 on each craft. They started flying North East and as they came overhead we could see that the lights were two seperate triangle shaped crafts. They seemed to be black or some other dark color. It wasn't completely dark outside, so when they flew over us we could see their shape. They were also very silent, and started to move very quickly and eventually were gone. Me and the passenger both believe in ufo's, as in, we believe there could be aliens, or it could also just be a secret military craft. But the area they were in is no where near a millitary base.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
