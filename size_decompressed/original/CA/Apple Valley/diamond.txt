HUGE craft with 3 lights, moved very slowly and made NO sound.;2015-11-07 18:00:00;15 minutes;HUGE craft with 3 lights, moved very slowly and made NO sound. On November 7, 2015, at approximately 6:00 pm, I witnessed what at first I thought were 3 airplanes following very closely to each other in the distance.  I realized that the lights were moving too slow to be 3 aircraft, so I watched them as they got closer.  When I realized that the lights were all on one “object”, moving VERY slowly and making NO sound, I went inside to get my roommate to witness this sighting too.  The craft was “diamond” shape with one light (white) at the front, one light (white) in the middle and one light (red) at the end.  It was heading in a northeast direction and moving very slow, like a blimp.  There was absolutely NO sound.  There were no other airplanes in the sky at this time.  My best estimation of its size is if you were to hold a dollar bill up to the sky, the length of this craft would probably have been about the length of 1/2 of the dollar bill.   I am positive that other people saw this craft because when my daughter-in-law went to work the following Monday, one of her co-workers asked her if she saw the UFO.  It really freaked her out.  I sent an email on Sunday morning (Nov. 8, 2015) to the editor of the local newspaper (The Daily Press, Victorville, Calif.) describing what I saw and asking if there were other witnesses.  The response I got was a joke.  I was told that what I saw was going to be on the front page of the Sunday paper, a missile launch!  I emailed him back, insisting that what I saw was no missile launch.  The fact alone that it was NOT streaking across the sky should have been his first clue.  I got no follow up response.
