Large Chrome Metallic Missile Shaped UFO Travelling At High Rate Of Speed.;2018-02-24 12:45:00;2 seconds;Large Chrome Metallic Missile Shaped UFO Travelling At High Rate Of Speed. Was in the car with wife today and about about 1pm or thereafter we were traveling on a busy road and in the span of about 1 to 2 seconds I saw a chrome Missile shaped craft falling to the earth at about a 45 degree angle.  About as fast as a meteorite, but cylinder shaped, sort of pointed on each end and long and super shiny metallic skin.  It seemed to be about 2 or 3 miles away but who can know for certain.  There was no noise or impact cloud or anything, we kept looking.  Because there were home tops, I could not actually see where it went down, but it was over Apple Valley, California, today. Really super bizarre thing to see.  Also, it was very much solid looking and not a reflection in the car window.  Very 3 dimensional.  It had to of impacted at an super high velocity.   One of the trippyest things I have seen in the sky.  Super fast!  Almost thought it was an ICBM, but it did not have a trail.

We witnessed a strange cloud formation that went for about 100 miles.  ((anonymous report));2019-05-15 19:20:00;Picture;We witnessed a strange cloud formation that went for about 100 miles it was unusual clouds never before seen clouds formation like it, it either came from or went into some sort of a Vortx it look like a worm hole vortex  I was taking pictures of it in the first picture that we took capture a cigar shaped UFO.  Very unusual but from the onset of the siding of this cloud formation I knew right away that it was not natural. I kept talking about how it looks like some sort of a wormhole or Some sort of a time travel Vortx or I thought maybe they were bombarding the atmosphere with those Haarp frequencies So we were taking pictures and I look at the picture and lo and behold there in the very first picture was a UFO.
