2 Red and 2 yellow teardrops seen playing over Apple Valley, CA.;2012-12-31 21:17:00;10 minutes;2 Red and 2 yellow teardrops seen playing over Apple Valley, CA I went outside and immediately saw two bright red teardrop lights moving south to north.   I estimated them to be 1/4 -1/2 mile from the ground.  From my perspective, taking into account that they were about 300 yards from where I was standing, they looked to be about 18 inches tall, so up close they would have been pretty good sized. They appeared to be playing, moving in random directions.  The one in the lead would stop and go back toward the second light which would move sideways.  It reminded me of a slow game of tag.  The first would stop then move ahead of the second light again.  They also moved in a slight crescent pattern at times. After a few minutes, they ascended at a fair rate of speed, both following the same path.  It took 1-2 minutes for them to be too small to be seen through the camera lens but they could still be seen with the naked eye. Within 30 seconds of them being too high to catch on camera, a bright yellow teardrop came from the same direction and followed the same path the red ones had taken into the sky.  As the yellow light began to ascend, a fourth teardrop, also bright yellow, appeared following the same path as the first three.  They were completely silent and all four lights went directly towards Saiph Kappa, part of the Orion constellation.  None deviated from this path.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
