Daytime / air to air near miss / sighting;1979-07-15 14:30:00;5-6 seconds;Daytime / air to air near miss / sighting This incident occurred on a cross country flight from Palm Springs CA, to Apple Valley, CA at approx. 2:30 in the afternoon , July 1979. I was flying one of the required cross country practice flights needed for a private pilot’s license. I was with my instructor at the time and had been flying on instruments only (IFR) for 20-30 min. At the time we were mid-way between Palm Springs and Apple Valley, which was our destination. We were approx. north-east of Big Bear when my instructor said to me that “we have traffic at 12:00”. This statement was to notify me that we had converging aircraft directly in front of us. This in itself was alarming because federal regulations state that all west and east converging aircraft were to fly at 1000 feet separation plus 500. This aircraft was obviously ignoring the rules because he was heading straight at us! As this object approached closer and we prepared for evasive maneuvering, we noticed that this object was void of any type of wing surfaces, propellers, engine nacelles, or landing gear. As we drew closer the object seemed to veer and passed off our left wing at approx. 100 feet. At this distance it simply appeared as a metallic sphere. It left no contrail, had no cockpit, and was most certainly moving under its own power on a flat trajectory. My estimation of its closing speed was that it was flying close to ours, based on my past experiences with other aircraft in close proximity. At the time we were flying in the 120mph range. The time available to see this machine was probably no more that 5-6 seconds at the most. Once it passed, I banked sharply to get on its tail. But by the time we were in position…it was simply..gone! Nothing had been said between my instructor and I during this entire event, until after we had finished looking for the object. I asked him “what was that?” His response was that he had no idea, and then told me “when we get back, don’t say a word about this ok?” And I never did. Not until almost 20 years later, when I found him again flying for a major airline, and had a chance to speak with him about it. All our recollections matched, and we both were still perplexed as to what that thing might have been. Since those days I have acquired a commercial pilot’s license and flown professionally. I have also acquired several degrees, one of which is in Aeronautics. And in addition, I became a federally licensed aviation maintenance technician. Now I am a public school teacher at the secondary level and teach technology education and aviation science classes. And NONE of my training, education, or professional experiences has helped me to explain what I saw that hot summer afternoon so long ago.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
Canyon Balls in Apple Valley California.;1998-10-17 15:00:00;7-8 seconds;Canyon Balls in Apple Valley California. I was hiking with my father and brother in the rock hills behind our house when I noticed a flash of light coming from a canyon about 2-300 yards away. I turned to look at it and I saw a small metalic ball hovering above the canyon peak. Just then It started to move slowly, then shot away in a weternly direction. I think it was about the size of a BB held at arms length.I got a good look at it. It moved so fast I could hardly follow it with my eyes. My father saw one of these almost twenty years ago, and chased it with his airplane.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
Sphere shaped object floating next to moon.;2001-08-07 15:00:00;10 minutes;Sphere shaped object floating next to moon. My friend and i were jumping on his trampoline at about 3:00 in the afternoon when I saw a shpere shaped object floating in the sky, easily visible with the naked eye, next to the moon (this was one of the days when you can see the moon during the day). My friend looked at it and called for his dad. His dad didn't know what it was either so he called his wife and daughter, but no one knew what it was. So after a few minutes my friends dad got out a telescope for a closer look and we all looked through it. It was big but i don't know how big and it was just floating there very very slowly moving closer to the moon. It was silver and very shiny. We all just went on with what we were doing and i checked for it again and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Large star like object , moving with a high rate of speed  across the sky.;2011-08-13 04:00:00;15 sec;Large star like object , moving with a high rate of speed  across the sky. Object was first sighted in the northwest traveling with great speed on a definite route to southeast. It was lower than a star but higher than a commercial aircraft.  It was all white like a bright star, no blinking, no sound, no trail of any kind.  There was no change in speed or direction, it appeared to be on a definite flight path which never changed and it was observed until out of sight.  There was considerable cloud cover however, due to its brightness, we were able to follow its path even through the clouds.  We had expected a meteor shower, but never anything like this.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066

This bright light then disappeared and in its place were several small colored lights. The brightest was red. I saw other red lights trailing the main one after it faded. I came inside to have more people come outside but when we did all the lights had disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Orange ball traveled west then disappeared in thin air.;2019-09-13 01:00:00;30 seconds;Orange ball traveled west then disappeared in thin air. Large orange ball of light flying slowly west bound, disappeared after a short time like it had a cloak on it.  I swear I could still see it a little, a shimmer of blue like electricity as it was disappearing. There was a helicopter in the sky flying south and at a lower altitude.  So I know it wasn't a normal aircraft.  It was random, I was about to go to bed when I glanced out the window and happened to see it.  I wanted to take a video but it already vanished before I could think to pick up my phone.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
