High Altitude Bright Objects appearing in the sky accompanied  by smaller, faster objects.;2010-05-27 21:00:00;45 min;High Altitude Bright Objects appearing in the sky accompanied  by smaller, faster objects. At 9:00 pm over Apple Valley Ca, my family and I witnessed a huge, stationary bright amber and white object that appeared out of thin air.  As the object got to its largest size a smaller object zoomed past it at a high rate of speed and stopped.  It then continued north towards Barstow Ca. As the small craft left the area,  The large craft/object faded and shrunk until it disappeared.   After the first sighting we started to see high altitude objects that looked and maneuvered like the first small craft.  We counted 10 of these strange UFO things in the same vicinity, one after another.   This is the first time reporting, however, we have been witness to several unexplainable sightings over the past couple of years.  This was by far the most exciting and the most objects in the same area at the same time that we have seen.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
Large fast moving light over Mojave desert moving left to right as we observed it in the east with about 15 seconds duration;2014-10-25 19:05:00;15 seconds;Large fast moving light over Mojave desert moving left to right as we observed it in the east with about 15 seconds duration we noticed a bright light moving from the north west to the south east, east of our location. it did not streak across the sky like  shooting star, but much faster than an air liner. I was unusual enough , that we went from our back yard to the front yard to observe the large bright light. we watched for about 5 more seconds stating to one another.  What do think that is? then it just went out.  Gone.  This sighting was unusual enough that we decided to report it. I'm not a believer in extra terrestrial but I do know that this is a very unusual thing we saw.;34.5017380165289;-117.202079752066
