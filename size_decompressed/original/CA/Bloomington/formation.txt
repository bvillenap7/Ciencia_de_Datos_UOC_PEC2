light formation in san bernardino  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable advertising light.  PD));2003-08-16 23:00:00;an hour;light formation in san bernardino my friend and I were on agua mansa and we were talking about how the air felt weird, eeire... and there were 3 lights that were moving around in big circle formation-uniform speed and it seemed like when they crossed paths their lights would get brighter and kind of more compact-at first they were softer looking...but got brighter and more intense with each circular rotation(all 3 went in opposite directions, but  joined together at one point...at least one light was kind of blue and one was yellowish.) We watched them for an hour...I got a picture, but you can't really tell what it is because it looks so small. We also had a tape recorder going and it seems to be going crazy with staticy electricity...it even totally stops for an unknown period of time ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We suspect that the witnesses may have observed an advertising light, and that the display may have had nothing to do with the difficulty the witness was having with the tape recorder.

Sighting by about 10 persons aged 6-50, orange redish pulsating globes, southern california;2010-05-16 00:01:00;10 minutes;Sighting by about 10 persons aged 6-50, orange redish pulsating globes, southern california There were a few of us present for this sighting as we’d been gathered all day for my cousin’s baby shower and were outside in the process of saying our good-byes when the sighting occurred.  Present were: Myself, 28, stay home mom of two, Softball/Baseball coach, umpire, and player My Husband – 30, Installation Technician/Manager 7+ yrs My children – ages 3 and 6, 6 yr old in Kindergarten and one of the top students in class, perfect                  attendance My brother – 19, college student Cousin – 25, Warehouse worker, college student Cousin’s girlfriend – 22, 9 months pregnant with first child Girlfriend’s brother and cousin – 23 & 25, males, background unknown My Aunt – early 50’s, preschool teacher 10+ yrs, Devout Christian  My cousin and I were outside at approximately midnight PST on the evening of 5/15/2010 turning into 5/16/2010. We observed about 12-13 much larger than stars size circles that looked like glowing, orange, pulsating globes. As we watched them float slowly towards each other into a pattern, he went inside to get the others present. Within seconds there was about 10 of us, ranging from my youngest of 3 years, and oldest of 6 years, to my brother, 19, my cousin and his friends and girlfriend, ranging from 19-25, then myself, 28, my husband, 30, and my aunt, early 50's. 	As we all stood in my aunt’s front yard we observed a few of the lights just disappear. The remaining lights began to move into a formation of a straight line, each equally spaced apart. They were moving from right to left across the sky at this point. This happened in Bloomington, CA as we were looking I would say South/South East and watched the lights move I’d say North East. 	There was no noise. There were no other crafts in the sky in that area at that time or for any time after. After the lights assembled in their line and proceeded in formation, all but one of the lights disappeared. Just poof, gone. No fading, twinkling, or anything similar. Just gone. One final light remained that slowly started moving South/South East away from us. But it wasn’t just away from us. It was up. And I mean way up. It almost started going literally straight up into the air into space it seemed from where it had been. It lost its “Glow” but still had a very distinct light to it, and was easy to follow as it disappeared into the heavens. 	My son spoke of how scary the experience was, but he truly doesn’t understand, as neither do we, what truly happened. We've also submitted photos we were able to get plus a picture my 6 year old drew to the website.;34.0662;-117.3993
