I was standing on the front deck of my home with 2 friends.  My partner and I were looking out off the deck towards the Trinity River (east).   Suddenly, a bright light illuminates the whole area around us.   The blue-white light was so intense that it lite up the opposite side of the river, approx. 3/4 mile away.   The light remained bright as it slowly set.  I could see it's arc outline as it shadowed the trees in our front yard.  It set behind our house, lower than the mountain-side that sits behind house, I could see the roof's shadow before it disappeared.   My friend (third person present) was facing the light source (west) and was really freaked out.  She asked us, What was that? to which we replied, Who were the one facing it?    She went on to describe the source of light as a bluish orb that shined with a thick fluid-like coating that rippled.  She said the orb just appeared out of no where, hung in the air, then went down slowly behind th! e house.   I then realized that the sounds of the night crickets, frogs, etc. had been silent during the orbs' presence.   A car drove by on the road out front and I could barely see the headlights which now glowed orange because of the heavy fog layer that covered the river valley.  My friend who had seen the orb was sure they were coming for her and didn't sleep that night, the guest room had a sliding glass door that exited into our backyard.  We hiked up the mountain side where the orb had set the next day but found nothing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));40.9467;-123.6314
