Bright lights that are stationary and that move and then seem to disappear.;2005-08-02 01:30:00;2minutes;Bright lights that are stationary and that move and then seem to disappear. Looking out my bedroom window I saw a very bright light above the tree line.  It remained stationary for about 2 minutes.  I got up and went outside to the backyard and saw another bright light behind the trees and moving from north to south very slowly.  When it was behind a tree it seemed to have disappeared because I could no longer see it.  There was no sound or aircraft in the vicinity.  This is not the first time I have witnessed these bright lights in the sky around my home.;40.9467;-123.6314
Bright light into the bedroom window woke us up.;2006-01-24 02:30:00;2 minutes;Bright light into the bedroom window woke us up. I woke up to a bright light that seemed to be shining into my window.  I figured it was a flashlight from a neighbor and went back to sleep.   About five minutes later my husband woke up to a bright light coming through the window and when he looked out the window he saw a circular light up in the trees.   When he looked up it moved to the back of the house.  When he went to the backyard the light hid behind trees as if it did not want him to notice it.   He looked at it for about two minutes and then it flew up into the sky and vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
