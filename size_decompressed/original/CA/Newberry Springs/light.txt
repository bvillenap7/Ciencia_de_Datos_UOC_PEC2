Strangest meteor I have ever seen.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:01:00;5 minutes;Strangest meteor I have ever seen. White light appeared in the West. The light got bigger in the sky as it appeared was coming right at me.  After a few seconds of getting bigger the light started to move to the right.  A larger secondary halo shaped light seemed to emanate from the primary source and lit up the whole west hemisphere.  After the primary light moved to the right it made a up and down squiggle leaving a large green cloud of light from where the light originated.  Took about 10 minutes for the light to dissipate in the sky.  No sounds were heard from the event. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));34.885;-116.7464
