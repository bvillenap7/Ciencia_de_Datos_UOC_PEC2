Yellow Orange Lights Spheres 15 then dissapearing have photos Newberry Springs CA;2010-08-18 21:59:00;11 minutes;Yellow Orange Lights Spheres 15 then dissapearing have photos Newberry Springs CA My father in law who lives about 2 miles from me called and stated there were bright lights to the SE of my home over the mountains which  border Palm Springs area.  I started photographing them and have several regular and zoom photographs. Circular objects initially 15 total very bright yellow/orange which were stationary and disappeared and reappeared reducing in number and eventually faded all together.  The objects never moved, did not float, were not attached to any object I could see, there was no noise with the objects either.  The objects were at least 5 miles away, however, I have a very good camera and can see them very well.  Weather was clear, no clouds, no breeze. Total even lasted about four minutes, verified by my father in law, this event happened again exact same situation either the 29th of 30th of August around the same time, but 11:00 pm, verified by my father in law again, but I was unable to get my camera.  My photographs are from my front porch in between my trees pointed up.;34.885;-116.7464
