It stoped , then moved , stoped ,moved, etc.  It didnt look still like a star .I know earth doesnt spin that fast to watch movement with naked eye. Plus it seemed to be moving back and forth and side to side. I also thought I could here it, who knows , this is a city. Kind of dis- tant blimp sounding. same as above . White lights. I dont now the name of stars around it. But all all those stars are basically all still in there same spots.Thats it. It just does not look like a star , I could see it moving .And unlike satilite movement also.  Thanks for your time.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
Pinpoint of light moving far too fast to be a satellite...Also not a meteor because there was no trail......;2003-11-03 21:45:00;15 seconds;Pinpoint of light moving far too fast to be a satellite...Also not a meteor because there was no trail...... I saw what looked like a satellite going over head. However the speed at which it was traveling was 2 to 3 times faster than any earth orbiting object that I have ever seen. It traveled from south-east to north-west and I followed it until it went below the horizon. I have witnessed many different earth orbiting objects as well as Comets and meteors. There was NO trail behind the object. Like I said it looked like a satellite but moved far too fast to be that. (Maybe it was an asteroid)?;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
Bright orange light in the sky;2006-05-23 22:00:00;5 min;Bright orange light in the sky I was taking out the garbage when  I noticed a bright orange light in the western sky. I called for my wife and we watched it hang in the air. It seemed to move in different directions in small increments and change brightness. This is the third time I have seen this thing. The other two times it was to the north. Had me freaked out. I am relieved to know others have seen it as well.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
While looking off our balcony, we saw a stationary bright light that after a few minutes dimmed and started moving at increasing speeds;2009-04-19 22:45:00;8 minutes;While looking off our balcony, we saw a stationary bright light that after a few minutes dimmed and started moving at increasing speeds At 10:45 p.m., we were having a conversation in our living room. I then noticed a bright light in the sky, and we went outside on our 3rd floor balcony to see what it was.   At first we believed it was a plane flying straight towards us, but we then noticed other planes in the air. This light was much brighter than anything we had ever seen in the sky at night before and much lower than any plane I’ve seen fly in our area.  It made absolutely no noise and appeared to be two lights connected together.  We grabbed my digital camera and took three pictures and one video.  The light kept its brightness and didn’t move from its original position in the sky for approx 4 minutes. At 10:49 p.m., it began to dim, move left, and increase in altitude. Once it gained a bit of altitude, the object leveled off and started to pick up speed. It then began illuminating brighter again. We recorded this part on my Cannon digital camera.   The object continued to travel leftwards in the sky and then decreased in altitude. It moved behind a tall building in the distance. At this point the object was the brightest that we had seen it.  It moved out of our vision while leaving us frightened and confused.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
Two orange lights slowly move across the sky.;2012-07-07 21:30:00;4-5 minutes;Two orange lights slowly move across the sky. My girlfriend and I were just backing out of the driveway, when she spotted a bright orange light in the sky. I got out of the car and filmed some of the event with my phone's camera. We watched as it lazily moved across the sky, in a slow arc from low on the southwest horizon  in a northerly direction towards the center of the sky.  It slowed down and seemed to stop moving as it approached the center of the sky, at least from our perspective. I thought maybe it was a satellite, like the International Space Station (due to its brightness). Having seen the ISS on several occations, I can say it was similar in apparent size and brightness, although the object we saw was definitely not the ISS.  It was too slow, it moved in a curve, it was a fiery orange color, and it was flickering like a bright star. As it started to dim, another one appeared where the first had started.  The first one faded, then brightened for an instant, then disappeared.  The other one followed suit, fading, brightening, then disappearing. It seemed to follow the same flight path as the first.  No other obects were sighted.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
