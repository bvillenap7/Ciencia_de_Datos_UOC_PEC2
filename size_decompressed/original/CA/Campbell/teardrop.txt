contrails and lil orbs real pics taken from a hp 735 digital  ((NUFORC Note:  Photos are ambiguous.  PD));2004-11-21 12:00:00;5min;contrails and lil orbs real pics taken from a hp 735 digital I took pictures of these.This is going to sound nuts, but hey i saw what i saw.And i took pictures of these three orbs small from my vantage point,steady moving in a direction. I have been observing interesting comtrails from jets, very suspicious contrails to put it lightly. This is when i observed these orbs right over head, moving towards a starta type cloud formation. About the same height a jet will create contrails.. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photos forwarded to our Center, and all we see is tiny little objects in the distance, about the size of a single pixel.  We have no idea what they are.
