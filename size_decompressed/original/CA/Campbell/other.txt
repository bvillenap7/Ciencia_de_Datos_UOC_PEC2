Bright white/green streak straight into Almaden Valley / Los Gatos area  - 5:34pm PST;2003-11-20 17:34:00;5 seconds?;Bright white/green streak straight into Almaden Valley / Los Gatos area  - 5:34pm PST I was driving South(SW)-bound on Bascom Avenue, immediately south of Hamilton, and directly in front of me, (~0.5-2.0 miles out?), I saw a bright streaking object falling/shooting in what appeared from my vantage point to be straight down. I initially thought it was a shooting star but it continued to shine brightly all the way down and did NOT disappear behind Mt Umhumnum (sp?) or the surrounding mountains. It was very bright, casting a very distinct greenish glow in the air around it. Based on how close it now seemed to me, I gauged it's speed. It seemed faster than a freefall - it seemed to fall @ the same rate of speed at which a professional firework goes up before it explodes. It really looked like an emergency flare, but was falling far too fast. I have been scanning the local news channels and am trying to find more info online to explain this strange sighting. I was alone in the car but believe I saw a few cars around me tap their brakes, weave a little, presumably because they saw the same thing. Me: I am levelheaded and usually prone to skepticism about most UFO sightings. If you saw this too or more importantly can explain it, please email me @ ((e-address deleted));37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
