2 Visible fireballs in night sky in Campbell, CA;2011-08-06 20:45:00;20 minutes;2 Visable fireballs in night sky in Campbell, CA UFO Sighting: Saturday, August 6, 2011 Campbell, CA    Approximately 8:45PM (PST) my friends’ 5th grade son points out an object in the sky that he thinks is a shooting star.  The object is about 317 degrees NW in the sky, according to my iPhone compass.   We continued to watch the object grow closer for about 2 more minutes when we realized that it wasn’t making any noise.  It also appeared to be glowing orange and had a circular shape.  It seemed like it was a glowing fireball.   But as it passed overhead at about 252 degrees W, we realized that it seemed to slow down and the glow started to dim.  As it began to disappear out of sight at 150 degree’s SE, the sphere was barely visible but was no longer glowing.   It took approximately 5 minutes to cross the sky all together.  t appeared to be flying a little higher that a normal commercial aircraft would fly.  We were located in a suburban area in Campbell, California, that is well lit so we did not see very many stars out but it began as a pretty clear night.  This was very bright! in the night sky.  As soon as it was almost out of view, we began hearing aircraft.  First was a large military, twin-engine craft, then a helicopter with a search light then military fighter jets.  Growing up near Moffitt Field, I know the sounds of the high-speed planes. Ten to fifteen minutes passed and a second bright orange ball headed towards us again.  It had the same bright glowing light, the same directionality and the same silence.  Unlike the first object, military planes were quickly following this one.  A larger twin-engine plane and this time 2 fighter jets.  Noticeably the planes were flying lower than the objects.   Unfortunately, the fog began rolling in from the west and obstructed our view of the rest of the events.    But before the object disappeared into the fog, we noticed that it had also begun to dim as the first one had. I’m not a technical person but I did record the images on my iPhone to view later.  As I was recording the images I noted that the object appeared to be the size of a dime in the night sky, where my iPhone video made it seem like a pin spot. There were 3 adults and 6 children all together watching this event.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
Single fireball spotted over Silicon Valley.;2014-01-15 20:10:00;4 minutes;Single Fireball spotted over Silicon Valley. Sitting on the patio my friend pointed out a ball of fire moving horizontally across the evening sky.   At first I took it to be a hot air balloon, as it was at about the right height in the sky and size.  It began to pick up speed, flying in a southeastern direction and ascending rapidly. Before long it flickered and faded out of sight and into the stars.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
Unexplained disappearing explosion-esque orb of light sighted in suburbia.;2015-09-06 21:30:00;3-5 seconds;Unexplained disappearing explosion-esque orb of light sighted in suburbia. On the night of September 6th, 2015, I witnessed an object I couldn't explain.  As I was watching a show on my phone whilst laying on my patio furniture, I saw a small orb of light out of the corner of my eye.  It grew to the size of an eraser on the end of an eraser, relative to my vision of course.  There was considerable distance between myself and the object, probably around the same altitude an airplane reaches during the middle of their flight.  The object did not move, it merely hovered and pulsated.  When I finally focused om the object, it swelled to its full orb-like appearance, then slowly receded into nothingness.  I searched the sky for the next 5 minutes, waiting for it to reappear, to show me that it was just a plane light, but it mever did. The object was the shape of an orb, or possibly a fireball.  I found myself describing it like an explosion contained by a very strong, yet clear glass. It was a burnt orange color with a white core, as far as I could tell.  It produced no discernible sound, no engines, motors, rotors, anything. Just the light. The sky was clear, no cloud coverage or much smog.  I could see the stars, which is why seeing this orb confused me so much.  This occured above a suburban apartment complex near a main thoroughfare.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
