We were facing towards Saratoga, CA.  It was 9 or 10 pm. A nice night. Clear sky and warm.  My friend and I saw a saucer shape with multi-colored lights. It looked like it was hovering over the houses about ½ mile away from our house. My friend saw it first and said “What is that?” Neither one of us knew what it was. I went inside the house to get my Mom. When we came back out, it was gone. My friend and I were both in Junior High School at the time.  There was nothing about this in the newspaper (San Jose Mercury News) for at least the next week. I know because I checked every day.
