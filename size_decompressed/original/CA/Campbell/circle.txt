Cone of light, bright blue contrail and symmetrical vapor cloud.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 19:00:00;5 minutes;Cone of light, bright blue contrail and symmetrical vapor cloud observed over Campbell from hazy moving point of light At 7pm observed what I thought was helicopter search light: a cone of light coming down at an angle surrounding a bright blue straight trail.  At the point where cone of light originated a large, symmetrical ovoid cloud of vapor then appeared.  The cone of light stopped but the bright blue trail remained visible as a hazy point of light separated from the vapor cloud.  The hazy point of light slowly continued moving up and to the West without a trail although the initial bright streak of blue and symmetrical cloud where it originated could still be seen and shown to other observers.
