Sighting of a pair of triangular UFO's over the SF Bay Area,  August 1974;1974-08-01 23:00:00;12 seconds;SUMMARY:  Sighting of a pair of triangular UFO's over the SF Bay Area,  August 1974 In the summer of 1974,  I saw a pair of triangular objects while stargazing with binoculars.  At the time,  I assumedthat they must have been aircraft.  But it's been a long time since then,  and I haven't ever seen any airplanes,or whatever, that even remotely resemble the objects I saw.I have just recently gained access to the Web,  and being amused by UFO stories,  I found my way to a couple of theUFO pages.  While browsing at Rutgers,  I ran across some reports of triangular UFO's, which made my hair stand on end.  Up to that time,  I had not heard of triangularUFO's.  Here's what I saw in late August, 1974 while Iwas in the backyard of my house in Campbell, CA (South SFBay area).I was laying on the ground, looking through a pair of 20 power binoculars.  My feet were pointed east, and the binoculars were pointed slightly to the right of straight up,  at about the one o'clock position.  Something went through my field of vision, moving right to left.  I caught up to it quickly,  and saw two objects flying in close  formation,  one behind and to the right of the one in front.They were both the same size, shaped like equilateral triangles with straight edges,  flying point forward. Their color appeared to be flat slate grey,  against a deep blacksky.  There were no features, and I saw no lights, or glow of any kind.  They appeared to be illuminated by the citylights.  It looked something like this:left (north)-                       .if this diagram doesn't-             -                .line up, select a fixed-                  -             .font (like courier). This-                      -           .line should be straight.-       .                 -          .-       / \                 -         .-       /   \                 -        .-       /     \                 -       .-      /       \                -       . I've draw this sideways-     /_________\               -       . because it was a little-                    .            -  top . easier, and the proportions-                   / \           -(west). are more accurate.-                  /   \          -      .-                /     \        -       .-               /       \       -       .-              /_________\      -       .-                             -        .-                           -         .-                      -           .-                  -             .-             -                .-                       .right (south)There was something very peculiar about the way they looked as they flew. The craft in front appeared more steady than  the trailing one, and the distance between them fluctuated randomly,  varying from nearly touching, to a maximum of a triangle length.  When the rear one began to lag,  it would suddenly snap back to a comfortable distance from the front one.  My impression was that it looked as though they were being manually controlled by pilots, and as if they had very high power to weight ratio, and like they were somewha thard to control.I watched them for about 8 to 12 seconds.  During that time,they maintained a due north heading, and covered about 80 to 90 degrees of azimuth.  After I lost sight of them,  I waited for several minutes for any sound.  I heard nothing.The binoculars were 20x50, with a field of view of 157 fee tat 1000 yards. If you assume that the objects were about 100 feet long,  and took up about 1/3 of the field of view, then their altitude would be 2000 yards, or 6000 feet, and their speed would be 568 mph.  That seems pretty conventional,but I think I would have heard jets at that altitude.Furthermore,  what jets have a perfect equilateral sillouette?The closest thing I can think of (that would be flying in 1974),is the B58 Hustler.  But my view was clear enough,  that I could have seen the little bit of fuselage in the front and backof the delta wing.I probably blew the simple geometry I used for the altitude and speed calculations,  but I've given enough facts that one could calculate height and speed for any craft of a given size.

Triangle UFO over San Joes, CA 12/2010;2010-12-15 23:00:00;2 minutes;Triangle UFO over San Joes, CA 12/2010 I was on my 2nd floor patio having a cigarette looking at the stars. All of a sudden I heard what sounded like a low, deep hum of what I thought was a cessna sitting on a runway just running the engine. I kept watching to the north where it was coming from. After about 10-15 seconds, two bright white lights appeared over the top of the next building, and heading towards over my building heading south. It appeared to be at about 500 feet above. I watched it was my jaw dropped. I was not scared of it, and in fact felt really comfortable, and even peace.  As it slowly, but continuously floated overhead, I noticed that it was a triangle!  The front was like two headlights. They were in the front of it, not below it. And as it was right above me, I noticed the back of the craft (triangle) had a light at that end also.  There were no lights underneath it.  The lights were reflecting the undercarriage where I noticed that it appeared to be a whitish-grey color.  I noticed some detail on it's belly like what looked like a long pipe running up one of the sides of the belly.  It didn't stop, or use any kind of spot lights. It just kept moving south until it moved completly over my building, and out of my sight. The total amount of time that passed from start to finish was about two minutes.  I looked at the clock as soon as I couldn't see it anymore, and it said 11:00pm California time.  After that, I couldn't get to sleep so I just laid in bed.   At about 12:15am, I heard that same exact sound again, and just laid there. I didn't know whether to get up and go look, or stay in bed where it was warm... I stayed in bed and now regret it.  I heard it for 15 minutes before it slowly got quieter, then complete silence.  I wish I had not made the decision to stay in bed.  What if this really was a UFO? That was a one-in-a-million chance. Nearby, there is Mountain View, CA where there used to be a NASA base. However, they do not test anything there. Up in the nearby Santa Cruz mountains, there is a secret military base where only God knows what goes on. There was nothing in the sky before the sighting, and nothing after. I am wondering if anybody else saw this? It was realatively early as there was still alot of cars driving on the streets, etc.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
Three orange lights in triangle shape hover in the sky above us then disappear.;2016-12-31 23:00:00;5 minutes;Three orange lights in triangle shape hover in the sky above us then disappear. My friends and I were in the backyard hanging out for New Year's Eve, when one of us saw three large orange orbs glowing in the sky.  We all looked up and everyone saw them. They were in he shape of a triangle with an orange light at each tip.  After a few minutes one of the lights went out, followed by the other two.  They didn't change locations or make any sound, just disappeared.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
