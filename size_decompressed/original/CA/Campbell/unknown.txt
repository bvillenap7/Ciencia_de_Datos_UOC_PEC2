Observation of a intense orange light that rapidly decelerated, then disappeared.;2006-02-16 00:02:00;1 minute;Observation of a intense orange light that rapidly decelerated, then disappeared. I was outside having a cigarette and staring at the sky (as usual).  I noticed an intense orange light low in the southern sky traveling at high speed.  I had seen an object similar to this last week that did a right angle turn so I grabbed my binoculars to see if I could see it closer.  Within a one-minute period, the object had traveled from above the hills in the south (15-20 degree elevation) to directly west of me (at about 45 degrees elevation), and had slowed to roughly 1/3 of its speed.  I could not make out any discernable features either with or without the binoculars.  As I was watching it, it disappeared.  I continued watching the sky for another two minutes, and the object did not reappear.  I am accustomed to aircraft in their approach patterns here, and the speed and light intensity of this object caught my attention immediately because it was not at all similar to aircraft.  As a note, I saw an object similar to this last week (earlier in the evening) traveling east to west at a extremely slow speed, and when I saw it make a right angle turn, I ran for the binoculars.  When I returned 30 seconds later, it was gone.  In both cases, skies were clear, it was several hours after sunset (and before sunrise), and there were no objects blocking my ability to view the object in question.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
Bright, slow moving orange light in the San Jose area.;2006-05-12 21:45:00;10 minutes;Bright, slow moving orange light in the San Jose area. As I arrived home, I spotted a intensely bright orange light in the ENE sky at about 60 degrees elevation.  Having seen this before, I got my housemate immediately so I could have a witness.  The light was moving slowly in a southerly direction, and was consistently decelerating.  After moving about 15 degrees in the sky, it came to a stop.  My housemate thought it was rising, though I couldn't tell.  Using my binoculars (with a large garbage can as a base to steady the binoculars), I viewed the light for 3-4 minutes.  There appeared to be a very dim orange light directly above the very bright light, with a distinct gap between the two lights.  The light moved slightly in a southwesterly direction, stopped again, then began moving north.  After traveling about 5 degrees in the sky, it pulsed once, then disappeared.  I watched for another 10 minutes or so, and the light did not reappear.  This is the third time that this light has been viewed from this location.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
Two mutli colored lights appearing to be outside atmosphere moving very slow then fading away;2009-12-19 01:45:00;10 min;Two mutli colored lights appearing to be outside atmosphere moving very slow then fading away On Saturday morning at 0145 Dec. 19, 2009 I saw two bright multi colored lights (red, green and blue) in the sky.  They moved very slowly from south to southwest.  I know they were not planes or helicopters, they moved too slowly.  I do know a little about astronomy, the ISS and space shuttles.  I make it a habit to know when the shuttle is orbiting with the ISS and watch for it.  Point being I could tell these two objects were very high in the sky and did not seem to be within our atmosphere. This lasted about ten minutes.  When I noticed them they were almost in line with each other.  One was on the left, the other to the right but a little below.  The one on the right moved very slowly from the right towards the bottom of the other while it was motionless.  Once in line straight up and down, they both traveled from south to southwest very slow then slowly faded away as you would see the shuttle do when it leaves the reflection of the sun. What I thought was interesting was that they faded away while moving to the west towards the suns light.  It also may be that they only appeared to move to the west.  It may be possible that they were going deeper into space. This occurred in the town of Campbell, Ca.  I am hoping someone else saw the same thing from a long distance away.  This would prove that these objects were in space.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
