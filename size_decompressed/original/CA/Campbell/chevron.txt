Difficult to see. seemed to move on top of eachother then one would drop back. then move forward again.  The wings seemes to move forward and back. They alomost looked like 2 large birds flying togeather but they were VERY big and VERY high in the sky. Made no noise (like you would expect of a jet fighter). They flew and looked odd. Would have gotten camera but it was moving to fast and seemed to blend well with the sky.;37.2810696969697;-121.957063636364
