2 gold /yellow oval /egg shaped  lights;1975-06-01 20:00:00;15 min;2 gold /yellow oval /egg shaped  lights we lived towards the end of town and use to play football in the schools footbal field at night.  It was getting to be dark ,and night fell quick around the rice fields.  We had sat down on the cosession stand triler and noticed 2 oval egg shaped Bright yellow lights coming towards us at about 100 feet or so up traveling from SE to NW these lights where not flashing they where just as someone had put 2 eggs but yellowish goldish on grey paper.  They flew in a formation like fighter pilots would there was absoloutly no sound, none.  They flew over us and towards the coastal mountains then striaght up after about 5 miles away from us.  We ran.  I myself was raise around USMC bases and know what all kinds of aircraft looklike at night. these where not like any thing I hve seen befor or since. It truly changed me ,and I will think about this till the day I die.;39.1362;-122.2129
