This video and photos were taken on October 20, at approximately 5:15am, right off of I-5 in Williams , CA.  While neither the photos nor the video reflect the true  shape of the two objects we saw which were glowing brighter than any planet I have ever seen in the sky, it is clear that they were not orb shaped.  They appeared in the shape of large dragon flies on their sides-one wing up and one down, and remained relatively stationary for around an hour as we travelled 40 miles to the east (Kelseyville) where we again observed them (still the same size).   I concluded they must be very large to appear the exact same size and brightness 40 miles away from the original sighting location.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o-BSpzi2KE  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ccj_RHR94Mg;39.1362;-122.2129
