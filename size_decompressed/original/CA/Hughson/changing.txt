An metallic object dropped out of the sky, changed direction, and then turned black while dissappearing into the clouds.;2008-02-17 16:00:00;5 Minutes;An metallic object dropped out of the sky, changed direction, and then turned black while dissappearing into the clouds. The object appeared nearly straight up in the sky on February 17th of 2008 between about 1600 and 1605 hours at my job site in Hughson, CA. At first it looked like a small silver spec about the size of a bright star. For about one and a half minutes it looked like it was coming directly down at me and the other security guard on duty as it grew larger. Then it stopped coming at us and changed direction to the Northwest. The object was closer now was definitely something metallic. At some points it looked like a sphere, and others it looked like different odd shapes.  The object continued moving northwest then it came back to the southeast for a few seconds. Then it changed direction back to the northwest very quickly and it no longer appeared metallic. For the rest of the time it was in view it looked to me like a black sphere. In about another minute or two, it had disappeared into the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally capable witness.
