We then saw it stop.  After a few minutes it developed a ring and started to change shape.  A few minutes later it changed shape and smaller objects with blinking lights began to emerge.  It seemed to change shape at least three times, not unlike a jellyfish.  Near the end of the sighting it seemed to disappear and reappear a few times.  We watched this object for between 20 to 30 minutes.;38.3545;-120.7573
