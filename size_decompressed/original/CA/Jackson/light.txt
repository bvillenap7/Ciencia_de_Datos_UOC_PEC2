Reddish star chases plane then slows and disappears out of view.;2015-02-15 16:00:00;15-25 minutes;Reddish &quotstar&quot chases plane then slows and disappears out of view. My boyfriend and i had gone to visit a couple of friends not far from our home.  After hanging out in the front yard for some time it started to get dark and we were gazing at the night sky talking about some of the strange lights and movements of the lights noticed lately by the 5 of us.  We were looking west and just above the horizon we noticed a brighter and larger than normal star.  In about ten minutes the light had moved quite a bit higher in the sky and all the while seemed brighter and closer to us than any other star.   I then began gazing at a plane crossing the sky from north going south and as it passed by under a small reddish star.   Then as it was almost past the star, that red thing then took off chasing the plane.  Then after it was almost caught up to the plane it reduced speed and seemed to go then outward and farther from our view.  All 5 of us noticed this and 4 of us had never seen anything like it before.   What was really strange was the 5th person had just been telling us that he has seen those (what he refers to as wobblers) chasing aircraft before.  Also strange, he noted that they for some strange reason seem to respond to us observing them and since i feel he just might be right.;38.3545;-120.7573
