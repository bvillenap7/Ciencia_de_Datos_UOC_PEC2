On the way home to my residence in El Sobrante @ approximately 1120pm my wife and I witnessed a luminous flash of blue light mixed with reddish crystal like sparks.  There was absolutely no sound, however we did have our car stereo playing but the volume was low enough to hear any significant sound impact.   This encounter is somewhat hard to explain because I have never seen anything like it, not even in movies.  It lasted only 2 seconds as we were driving.  My wife was driving, the incident occurred to the left side of the road somewhere between Orinda and El Sobrante, on Camino Pablo Rd..   In this area there is nothing but a single two way road with a bunch of trees that spreads for many acres of land. To the right is a lake/reservoir.  If you google San Pablo Reservoir, and click on images, this will give you clue as to the area we encountered this strange luminous lighting.   As we compared notes, my wife seen the same pattern of light as I did,   However, she also seen that it came straight down, into the hills.  It wasnâ€™t like a flash in the sky, it was almost like fireworks with the flames descending. The distance from our vehicle to the sighting was roughly 300 feet.  We ruled out the possibility of fireworks because if it were fireworks we would have heard them. With the amount of light produced, if it were fireworks I would have heard it with my stereo all the way up.  Finally, this may have been some weird weather phenomenon, however I have been living in this area for 19 years, I have never seen anything like it. Everthing was normal, senses in tact, time ok, just the vision of the encounter will remain in my head forever.;37.8828;-122.1717
