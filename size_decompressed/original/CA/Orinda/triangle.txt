At first thought it was a bright star. However, having grown up my entire life (over 30 years) in the area, I knew it couldn't be a plane, and it wasn't a helicopter because I didn't see or hear any rotor-blades. I stopped my car, turned off the engine, and rolled down the window and looked out. I heard no noise as the craft slowly passed overhead going roughly southeast - it was low enough at this point to know for sure that there was no engine/rotor noise. It was roughly 300-400 feet above, and its speed was a slow 15 mph or so. It was a black triangle, with bright white lights on each of the three tips. I could definitely see the shape of the black craft against the dark, night sky. There were two thin white light lines parallel to one another and close together, in the center of the craft pointing in the direction it was moving. It was around 25 feet wide or so. Again, no noise at all. There was also a red light behind it that was bl! inking very fast at times as well. I didn't know what to think about it at first, so I rolled up the window, started the car and went on driving. After about 15 seconds or so, I got a very nervous feeling that maybe this was something that could not easily be explained. Since it wasn't a plane, helicopter, or anything with an engine, the only other explanation would be a glider or a remote controlled vehicle, however this area of Orinda is one of the highest points, so a glider wouldn't be a practical explanation. Also, anything remote controlled would presumably make some sort of noise, and at 20 - 30 feet from tip to tip, that would be a big remote flying machine.;37.8828;-122.1717
