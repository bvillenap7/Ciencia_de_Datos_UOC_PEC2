Circular object with v-shaped notch, hovering in daylight;2003-07-22 11:00:00;10 mins;Circular object with v-shaped notch, hovering in daylight The object was hovering over the Orinda BART station,  much like a hawk using thermals to stay aloft.  It was round and flat with a v-shaped notch at one point on the circumference.  The bottom was black and the top (which was exposed as it turned slowly like a plate balanced on a stick) reflected the sun with a bright metallic sheen.  As I watched, it slowly moved higher and farther away towards the southeast.  It seemed to be no more than 1 or 2 feet in diameter. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport: I'm sorry to say that I'm the only witness I'm aware of.  I was watching the object from the side of Camino Pablo (the road which runs under the BART station) about 1500 feet from the station.  While I gave some thought to stopping a car driving by and asking them to take a look, I did not do so, since they were going about 45 mph.  Unfortunately, at 11 AM there aren't many people waiting on the BART platform, and I think that the overhang might have shielded them from seeing the object. Next time (assuming it isn't 48 more years until I see one again) I will definitely bring my digital camera !
