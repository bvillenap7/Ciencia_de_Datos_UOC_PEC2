Cigar-shaped UFO, silver, non-descript moving North/Northeast in East Bay Hills of Contra Costa County, CA;2004-06-02 12:00:00;30 seconds;Cigar-shaped UFO, silver, non-descript moving North/Northeast in East Bay Hills of Contra Costa County, CA One cigar shaped, metallic object, moving North East. Not shiny, but silver.  At first thought it might be a plane, but saw no wings or tail.  Non-descript, meaning, no detail seen.  Couldn't tell if it was far away, or close.  Just moving in the direction North, North-east until the hills blocked the view.  I am a recording engineer who works in Berkeley and was driving on 24 West, approaching the Caldecott tunnel..traffic was slow, and I had time to look out my window.  At first I saw this object and thought to myself, Oh, maybe that's a blimp, or a weather balloon, but then realized it was not that at all.;37.8828;-122.1717
