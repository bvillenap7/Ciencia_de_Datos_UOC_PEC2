I discard the as just three shooting stars, but then I notice they zipped around in an odd way somewhat like this: left,right,down,right,up,left,up,right. I looked up and I saw them morph from a cigar shape to a firey sort of color with little electric glowing thing that looked to me like plasma surrounding it. I was about to get my camera, but they zipped away right before I could snap a picture. You people are the first people I've told about my incindent.Thank you for reading my story.
