It was behind the cloud briefly but was always visible through the cloud except for a second or two when a dense spot in the cloud obscured it completely. Another identical point of light appeared from behind the cloud trailing the first point of light at about a 2 distance at arms length.  There was no relative motion of the two points.  I noticed a third point of light trailing the second by 2 at arms length, but this point of light was definitely below the cloud and a light greenish blue in color, similar to an airport beacon.  The three points of light slowed and drew closer together, forming an equalateral triangle.  They stopped completely, but at that point the cloud blew between myself and the objects and I could no longer see them.  The motion of the objects was opposite the motion of the cloud, and the clouds were at the 5000 foot level.  Assuming the objects were at cloud level, the triangle formation would have occurred approximately between Thurston Middle School and the large S curve in highway 133.  John Wayne airport is approximately 10 miles North from that location.;33.5409;-117.7846
At first it looked like it could maybe just be a plane but then shot up down and side to side.;2006-07-06 00:30:00;45 min;I was smoking a cigarette on my balcony across the street from main beach in Laguna Beach when I saw a circular craft with all white lights and one red.  At first it looked like it could maybe just be a plane but then shot up down and side to side.  It continued to fly around doing the same kind of manuevers for at least 45 minutes.  Other people were noticing it and taking pics ect..... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.5409;-117.7846
UFO sighting in Laguna Beach!;2007-06-30 00:00:00;at least 5 minutes;UFO sighting in Laguna Beach! My friend and I were had stopped to get gas at the Chevron in Laguna Beach, Ca on the corner of Legion and Pacific Coast Highway and immediately stopped what we were saying when we saw something up in the sky. It was circular and had lights all around it and was moving around all over the flace quite fast and erradicly and flying pretty low. We thought it disappeared for a minute and then it appeared right above us and I when I looked up I could see that it was silver and had lights circling it and was fairly big. It looked like any cheesy UFO you'd see in a movie and I couldn't believe it was right above us!!! There were about six other people on the sidewalk that saw it too and we were all just staring up in amazement. My friend got scared and wanted to leave, so we drove away before we got to see where it went next. I've never seen anything like this before in my life and there's no way it could be anything else BUT a UFO!!!;33.5409;-117.7846

We were sitting on our third floor patio which faces Newport Coast Drive in Newport Coast, California, and this bright light appeared to shoot up into the sky over the ocean (we guessed Laguna Beach area) and it would drop rapidly down.   Saw red colors on it, and got binoculars and saw many colors like a prism.  The light would shoot straight up and then travel a little and shoot down rapidly again.   Guessed airplane, helicopter, but it was too quick to be either..;33.5409;-117.7846
Saw UFO flying over ocean, while on my deck.;2017-10-26 18:40:00;40 minutes;Saw UFO flying over Ocean while on my deck. I take pictures of the beach, sunsets, clouds almost every night from my deck in Laguna Beach.  In October 26/27th, I saw this orb show up almost out of no where.  It hovered around the clouds (NW very close to Catalina Island) right after the sun had set, and was there until it was pitch black, then disappeared.  I did not see it disappear as heavy clouds rolled in, but I look every night at the same place and there is no star or planet or anything like that at all there. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Hi There,  I wanted to submit a couple photos that I took from My deck in Laguna Beach, California. I take pictures of the beach, sunsets, clouds almost every night from my deck. In october 26/27th I saw this orb show up almost out of no where. It hovered around the clouds (NW very close to catalina) right after the sun had set, and was there until it was pitch black, then disappeared. I did not see it disappear as heavy clouds rolled in, but I look every night at the same place and there is no star or planet or anything like that at all there. Not sure fully what I have here, but if you guys could take a look at my pictures and let me know what you think, id love it!  I will attach photos that are on my Digital camera as well. I will show you some zoomed out, so you can see the scale of everything. I will also send pictures of it zoomed in so you can see what I was seeing up close. On the zoomed out pictures, the ORB in right above the cloud in the middle, you will see it.  ((END ADDENDUM)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2)) Hi Peter, Thank you for your timely response! I am sure of where I was looking becuase I have Catalina Island as my base point. I was looking out 285 degrees W over the Ocean about 1.5 miles out and 1 mile up.
