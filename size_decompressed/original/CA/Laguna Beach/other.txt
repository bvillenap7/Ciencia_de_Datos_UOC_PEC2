Located about 40/50 deg, up from the hor. in the sw sky from my vantage point in Laguna Beach.  ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter??  PD));2011-02-10 23:00:00;hours;Located about 40/50 degrees up from the horizon in the southwest sky from my vantage point in Laguna Beach, CA. Appear as if stars, meaning the lights are so far away they appear as tiny lights, like stars, but they are moving radically (incapable for conventional aircraft or space craft) as if in an aerial dog fight. It looks like some sort of battle or maneuvers. I only watched for about a half hour or 40-minutes +/- each night (Th. 02/10/11 & F 02/11/11), so the duration could be much longer than just my watch.
