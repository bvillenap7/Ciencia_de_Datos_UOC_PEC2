6-7 glowing red lights in the sky over Laguna Beach;2012-08-23 21:00:00;3 minutes;6-7 glowing red lights in the sky over Laguna Beach About 9:00 PM, I was on my deck in north Laguna Beach and I saw six or seven glowing red balls of light in the sky in an erratic formation over south Laguna Beach or Laguna Niguel.  They appeared to be about mile up into the sky and maintained altitude while moving north.  A couple of the lights in the middle of the formation appeared to occasionally zig-zag from side to side in a very abnormal fashion.  Everything seemed quiet - no aircraft noise. I managed to get one iPhone photo.  After about 4 minutes, they vanished as they were still moving northbound.  About two minutes after that, a commercial airline flew by, heading southwest (I think).;33.5409;-117.7846
