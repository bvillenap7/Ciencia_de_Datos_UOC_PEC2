The object the exploded into a perfect circle of white dust that was equally dense in all areas.  The object still remained after the explosion however.  It was so bright that it appeared a spotlight was being shown through the dust of the explosion like a helicopter.  This lasted only a couple of seconds.  The fast movement of the object left a trail of flourescent blue that remained for 30 minutes.  After the object passed through the smoke, it went to about 3 feet above the horizon from our standpoint a remained there with two cone like but dusty white things coming from the top and bottom of the object then these went horizontal and remained there for 5 minutes. It then went downwards slowly until it dissapeared. I think I now believe in UFO's that was the weirdest thing I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));33.5409;-117.7846
