I was a non beliver , but now im leaning twards the idea that there are things watching us.;36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999

I reported it to the FAA and U. S. Coast Guard, and found out the next day there was reports up and down the California coast of the exact thing I had seen.  The scariest part of my experience was watching it fly with intelligence and as odd as it may sound.  When it noticed me noticing it, it changed course and flew away..   Triangle shaped no other color but red and could stop and go at will and hover.  Never seen anything like it.  Made me shake in fear!
