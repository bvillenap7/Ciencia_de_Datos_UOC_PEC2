Something caught my eye that was in the sky. I looked at it, it had 4 different color lights and an antenna in the back. It was flying very low, and was fairly close to us. So it seemed quite big,it made no sound what so ever. Once my friends and I began to chase it, we heard the kanines in the nearby homes bark like crazy. And it started to lower to ground as if it were going to land or crash and it just dissapered!;36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999
Circular or disc shaped flying object with flashing lights, light in color, silent and leaving instantly.;2011-01-27 09:55:00;4-5 seconds;Circular or disc shaped flying object with flashing lights, light in color, silent and leaving instantly. I was walking my dog along a road which is lined with tall eucalyptus and pine trees planted approximately 25-30 feet apart.  I witnessed what appeared to be a circular, or saucer shaped flying object.  It was the color of a very pale, clear sky.  What caught my attention were the round flashing lights around the perimeter.  It was flying behind the tall trees.  It was silent in its movement, moving in the direction North/Northeast.  It was flying parallel to the ground approximately midway between the height of the trees. I ran to the next open space between the trees to get another look, but the object was no longer in sight.  It had left the area almost instantly.  When small or large airplanes fly over this area at a much higher altitude, the noise can be heard.  This flying object was silent.  Because the object left so quickly, I was unable to determine its actual size. ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS)) Distance and height of flying object seen This information is in addition to the first report of this incident.  I walked back to the area where I observed the UFO and counted off steps in order to give better location.   I was approximately 15 feet from the fence and the object was approximately 15-20 feet over the fence.  Comparing my height 5'3, to height of object it was approximately 15-20 feet above the ground.   This is a quite, rural area at the end of a dead end road. I have never seen anything fly that close to the ground and not make a sound. This incident first seen and reported on January 27, 2011 ((END ADDENDUM));36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999
Large gray craft in Watsonville, CA.;2012-01-03 12:05:00;5 min;Large gray craft in Watsonville CA. I left work for lunch and as I was driving SW and to the South hovering over the Aromas area was a huge gray craft shaped like a ball squished semi flat.  My guess is it was 1000+ ft wide. It looked to be about 3 miles away.  I find it hard to believe nobody else saw this.  I drove on until it was blocked from my view.  I don't know what happened to it after that.;36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999
