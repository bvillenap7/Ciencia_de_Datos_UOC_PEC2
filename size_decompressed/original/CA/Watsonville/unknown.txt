Lights in sky I thought it was a shooting star;2016-10-02 04:50:00;7 seconds;Lights in sky I thought it was a shooting star I got up early to walk my dog before heading to Sjc airport from my mothers house in Watsonville, ca.  I live near Dallas tx.  The sighting occurred about 30 min or so before sunrise.  I looked up into the sky an noted how clear it was compared to home I then looked over at my dog and saw from my prerfrial vision almost directly above what I thought was a shooting star heading south.  I looked at it and focused on it and saw that it was not a single shooting star but a cluster 4 or 5 points of light all moving together at high rate of speed and different intensities, but each one looked no different than any other star in the sky only moving at high rate.  As I watched it move towards the horizon I saw two of the lights swap places once and then twice.  As it neared the horizon it seemed to slow down as it should from my perspective only more than I would expect and it also turned to the east and went behind a tree and house.  During the first half of the sighting I was looking for a tail or sparks coming off the cluster but didn't see any.  Due to the odd trajectory of this, I suspect it was over central or Southern California and when it turned east, was heading for Edwards afb or groom lake.  I also suspect the points of light swapping places was in fact sunlight reflecting off a shiny surface.  There was no sound from it and no sonic boom.  There was a passenger jet at high altitude I noticed to the east of the sighting going north and within a minute of the sighting I could hear the jet but no noise from the area the lights were seen.  After thinking about it makes sense to land a secret spacecraft on a Sunday morning when the least amount of witnesses could view it. keep looking up in the sky an hour before sunlight if you live on  the west coast on Sunday mornings.;36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999
