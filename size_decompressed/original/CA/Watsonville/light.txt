Watsonville, CA I went out side to smoke a cigarette and have my coffee at about 6 am. It was beginning to get light out side, but the sun hadnt appeared yet. I was looking at the mountains to the south east ( about 15 miles from my back yard ), and noticed a red burning object in the sky. It looked like the tail end of a missle, the way it was burning. All I could see was the bright red tail (megenta color) . I thought that a missle or rocket was being launched from the hills, but the wierd part was that it didnt go any where. It stayed in one general area fo about 30 mins, slowly moving around. It then started to slowly move east, toward Gilroy, Ca. It dissapeared over the hills for about 3 mins. , then reapeared again, this time moving south. It didnt look like any plane or helicopter Ive ever seen. when the sun came up over the mountains its red-plasma-like color started to slowly turn translucent/white. I assume that it was alot larger than a jet, it also looked like some parts were tranparent.  I dont know what I saw, but Im sure plenty of other people in this area saw it too this morning.;36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999
