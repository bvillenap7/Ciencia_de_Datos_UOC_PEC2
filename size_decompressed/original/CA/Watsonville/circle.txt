((anonymous report));2017-12-13 21:45:00;3 seconds;large, dull red-colored, round object with a darker brownish glow around the outside going very fast I heard on the news it was to be the Geminids meteor shower, so I decided to have a look and see if I could see any.  I was in the back yard about 5 minutes when this large, dull red-colored, round object with a darker brownish glow around the outside, came across the sky from behind me, directly above me.  It looked to be as high as jumbo jets  fly, like 30000 or 40000 feet, but it was as big around as the eraser on the end of a pencil and the brown glow extended outward from that, about half as much, the diameter of the red part.  It never glowed or illuminated like a meteor would and was going about 100 times faster than an airplane.  It went from almost directly above me to halfway to the horizon in about 2-3 seconds.  I’ve seen a lot of meteors and I’ve never seen one like that.  It seemed to me like it was slowing down as it got farther away but it was going really fast the whole time I could see it, if that makes sense.  The sky was cloudless, but there was some lack of darkness from the city lights. ((anonymous report));36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999
