They turned into 3 lights then into one light and seemed to move up in the sky away from us at really fast speed. We were inside the Target shopping center on Main Street when it happened.;36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999
Disturbing but exciting experience. Formation of lights.;2020-12-02 18:00:00;3:00 minutes;Disturbing but exciting experience. Formation of lights. I was looking at Mars and I was also watching a satellite passing by. I always do, but all the sudden a bunch of lights start to passing by.  From my location, they were coming  from South to East, about 70° or so above the horizon, there’s a lot of them,too many to count,I see them appear and  disappear. it’s a short travel. I calculate that the whole thing lasted about three minutes. from the moment I started to see them,it took me about 30 seconds to decide if I go inside the house and take my cell phone, so I did run inside the house took my cell. My  recording is almost  two minutes long, so I think  altogether it was more or less three minutes. I was looking at my recording but I cannot see anything other than Mars, however I’m very happy that today, I find out, throug  the Internet, that other people saw the  same thing, that’s just great to know!.  The experience to me it was disturbing and exciting.  Thank you for Reading my message:);36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999
