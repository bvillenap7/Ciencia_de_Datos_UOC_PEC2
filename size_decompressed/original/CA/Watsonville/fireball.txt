Three Fireballs in formation off coast of California, circle into one Fireball and vanish.;2010-08-22 17:30:00;5 minutes;Three Fireballs in formation off coast of California, circle into one Fireball and vanish. As I went out onto my back porch to view the early sunset (Ocean view) I instantly noticed 3 Orangish-red bright balls very far off the coast, literally 100's of miles from the beach moving in triangular formation while rotating clockwise very slowly and moving at a medium speed north.   At this point I called my brother out to view the sight as I knew he wouldn't believe me as I was always the kind of person who would believe in stuff like this, and he would be the kind who would look for a logical explanation. The fireball like orbs seemed to glow dimmer and brighter at a constant rate.  They soon stopped in a perfect triangle formation and after a brief pause, cirlced together clockwise perfectly in to one fireball of the nearly same size.   Shortly after the ball simply vanished or what looked like at the time, extinguished the flame or turned out the light.  My brother and I were dumbfounded, and could come up with no logical explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
