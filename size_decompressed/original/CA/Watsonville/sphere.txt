Four slowly moving white round objects seen in sky over Watsonville, CA.;2004-03-27 17:55:00;10 minutes;Four slowly moving white round objects seen in sky over Watsonville, CA. My wife and I had just walked out of the grocery store on Green Valley road and Main St. in Watsonville, CA.  It was almost 6pm and the light was still good and the sky was clear.  As we were getting into the car, my wife looked up in the sky and said Wow, look at those 2 objects in the sky. I got out of the car and looked to where she was pointing.  There were three round, bright white colored objects (almost like they were refelcting the suns rays) moving very slowly towards the South to Southwest.  They appeared to be very high up, yet were distinct and easy to see.  We watched as they slowly lined up in a straight line, stopped and stayed in the same spot for about a minute, then they moved into a triangle position.  My first reaction was They're not planes or jets, if they are helicopters they are very high  Their appearance was totally spherical, not like any aircraft we had ever seen.  We watched for about 2-3 minutes, and they appeared to be at the same altitude as when we first saw them, so they didn't appear to be balloons or something like that.  They moved very slowly, almost like hovering, then stopped, then moved again into a triangle formation.  Then after about a minute in this position they spread out into a large V formation as a fourth object slowly approached from the north and joined the V, then stopped in place as the others were.  We stood there in the parking lot of the grocery store staring up at the sky in disbelief for 10 minutes.  The light was then slowly ebbing into twilight.  To confirm whether it was some kind of stellar phenomena, I looked to where Venus was in the sky and I couldn't see it, nor any other stars or planets.  I looked back and the objects were still in their V formation, now slowly moving south.  We got in our car and drove home attempting in vain to rationalize this to some kind of human created technology.;36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999
Red spheres.;2017-02-13 20:00:00;5&gt;red spheres Having a smoke brake in the backyard, we saw about 6 spheres moving around very fast.  They kept blinking red/orange and then disappearing, then reappering.  A few of them lined up in a row.;36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999
