Moon rose in two different spots;2021-04-01 22:00:00;Two nights;Moon rose in two different spots What I saw has to do with the rising of the moon. One night the moon rose from the North-esst horizon and then a week later the moon rose slightly south east. It basically rose in two different places a week or so apart. I don't know what this may mean. Thanks;36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999
