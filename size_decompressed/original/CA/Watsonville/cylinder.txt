Saw airplane fly into space midday;2021-04-01 14:00:00;3 minutes;Saw airplane fly into space midday I saw what looked like a small airplane go straight up into the sky and disappear. It looked to me like it had gone into outer space because it got smaller within an area of three inches holding my arm out to the sky. It didn't travel to the horizon it actually just went straight up in the air and disappeared. It had no vapor trail and by the time it went farther up I couldn't see wings on it anymore. Another person was there and he could not even see it when I pointed it out to him even though it was clearly there to me he couldn't even tell it was there.;36.9101999999997;-121.756399999999
