I glanced into the night sky and noticed an orange object near the Planet Jupiter.  It appeared to be the same size as the planet Mars except the orange color was very sharp.  At first I thought it was Mars, but quickly realized it was much to far East.  As I watched the object, it began moving slowly north.  I asked my wife for our binoculars (7x35).  When she returned, I steadied myself on our van to get as good a look as possible. Through the binoculars the object still seemed planet (Mars) sized and a very bright orange.  The brightness faded once or twice for just a brief moment.  The speed varied, sometimes stopping.  It travelled due north and faded from view at the night sky's zenith.  My observation lasted about ten minutes (0:10 to 0:20).;33.9072988399066;-118.008707192578
Single orange glow, very bright orange light traveling accross the sky;2004-10-23 23:15:00;5 minutes;Single orange glow, very bright orange light traveling across the sky Location: La Mirada, Orange County California Date: 10/23/04 Time: 11:15pm Witness: 6 people  Full moon around 11:15 pm (PST) saw a single orange light, very bright and glowing. Close to the moon as it traveled across the sky. We were watching it for 3 minutes. Then the orange glowing light stopped and it was just stationary for about 30 seconds. Then, suddenly I saw a plane coming. Looks like a military jet but no sound. It has 3 dim white lights. One on the right wing the other on the left wing. The 3rd light was on the nose of the jet plane. As this jet plane (I'm sure it was a military jet but it didn't make any sound?! And my view was as if i was looking at the bottom of the plane so kinda look like triangle becaue of the 3 dim white lights.)It was moving very fast and as soon as it passed the orange glowing light, (the Orange light was higher than the jet) the orange glowing light started to get smaller and smaller. It was so tiny but i could still see this orange bright light until it disappeared. There were 6 of us who saw this. Me my wife, my two daughters (ages 8 and 6) and my wife's step mom (who saw it first). Amazing! I couldn't sleep. I called 4 city's police dept. to find out if other people reported it, but nothing. I logged in the internet and type in search UFO Reporting and that's how i saw your site. I called your hotline (202) and a recording lead me to this form report. I also went online-chat to talk about it. I have to let somebody know. It was an amazing, unbelievable experience.;33.9072988399066;-118.008707192578
