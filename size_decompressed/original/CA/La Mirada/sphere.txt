Multiple orange lights seen by couple in Los Angeles' skies.;2013-02-23 19:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple orange lights seen by couple in Los Angeles' skies 6:55 pm to 7:02 pm Driving west from our home, I noticed some very bright, round or spherical, orange lights in the sky to the north.  As we turned south I watched them and  more appeared in the night sky, in a line some 2 or 3 across in a formation of sorts – keeping their equal distance from the center light.  They seemed to be moving closer very slowly and climbing higher. (like the video I found on your site – a line up in the sky)  We turned west again and parked to watch them between two houses.   I initially counted 9 or 10.  Then it seemed a few of them disappeared, or the lights went out, so I started counting again.  Then the ones that went out came back on in their original formation, still in line with the other lights. Then more started appearing at the horizon…..until we counted 25.  I tried to photograph them with my cell phone camera, but was unsuccessful at capturing them clearly. (7:01 pm) My husband noted a jet with its red flashing light far below these orange lights. (We live where we can see the East to West flight path of jets at night, approaching LAX)   These orange lights were very gradually moving south.  The jet was moving along its normal path from East to West. We needed to move our illegally parked car and get going to our destination, so we were unable to study them more. They appeared to be floating in the sky, gradually moving up and toward us (N to S).  Their size was bigger near us, than the size of the lights on the horizon but the color was consistent for all of them.  They maintained a bright orange color…no fluctuations.  There was a single light at the front/top of the column of lights.  Their formation and slow movement in a column, made me think of invading aircraft from the old war movies and I actually said,” Are we being invaded?” as more and more of them appeared. There was no sound – too far away.  We considered helicopters, but we have seen plenty of military and police aircraft, having livied here for 30+ years, and have never seen anything like this or anything with this color of light. O  O     O      O  O          O  O    O      O  O  O        O        O     etc.  Male and female, mid-50's, college educated, laborer and secretary, grown children....just regular folks out for a Saturday date night at the local symphony.;33.9072988399066;-118.008707192578
Police helicopter and a low flying, very brightly lite object, flying close together on 22 June over La Mirada, California.;2014-06-22 21:03:00;4 minutes;Police helicopter and a low flying, very brightly lite object, flying close together on 22 June over La Mirada, California. I was visiting La Mirada, California.  I saw a bright light traveling north to south and it also traveled directly above me.  This sighting was for 4 minutes from 9:03-907 pm Sunday night on 22 June 2014.  I first noticed the bright light in the northern sky over La Mirada Regional Park.  It was bright and low. It flew directly overhead and continued towards Fullerton.  The light did not change in intensity as it was coming towards me or when it traveled away from me.  There were no flashing collision lights.  I was standing about one block south of the park.  I am guessing that around the border of La Mirada and Fullerton, less than a mile south of me, the brightly lite object slowly faded out.  For a few seconds, I could see the city lights reflect off the very dark, black object.  Just for a second I looked at the helicopter and when I tried to relocate the unlike black object, I could not find it.  This sighting was unusual in that there was a police helicopter! traveling with the UFO and at about the same speed.  The helicopter and the brightly lite object were only a few hundred feet apart.  The helicopter was not directly under it, but was slightly west of it.  After both objects passed me and were almost in Fullerton, the helicopter made a 90 degree turn to the east passing under the glowing object.  About 10 seconds later, the glowing object slowly faded out over a 4 or 5 second period of time.  That is when I could see the city lights reflect off the dark or black object.   The object looked to be about the same size as the helicopter, even though it was a little higher than the helicopter.  Of course I can't say whether the officer in the helicopter saw the glowing object, but it sure looked like the helicopter was following it.  I can't imagine that the officer did not see it, in fact, I had the impression he was following it.;33.9072988399066;-118.008707192578
I saw a glowing Red and Yellow Sphere at the inner sections of La Mirada Blvd and Rosecrans, La Mirada CA. .;2014-07-04 23:00:00;2 minutes;I saw a glowing Red and Yellow Sphere at the inner sections of La Mirada Blvd and Rosecrans, La Mirada CA. on 4th of July 2014 On 4th of July, 2014, we were driving through La Mirada, CA, between 10:30 & 11:00 PM and on the enter section of La Mirada Blvd and Rosecrans I notice a Police officer pointing his exterior spot light directly up into the sky as we drove closer to the enter section I looked up and there it was red and yellow glowing Sphere above us I'm guessing around a 1000 ft above us,  my wife was driving and our niece was in the back seat I told her to look up and she also saw the Sphere, my wife couldn't see it cause she was driving but noticed the officer shinning his light upward.  I only looked up because of the expression of the officer's face in disbelief as too what he was seeing.   That's what caught my attention.  we did not pull over but I stuck my head out the window and saw that the Sphere began to go straight up and disappeared;33.9072988399066;-118.008707192578
