Triangular shape blocking out stars in front of the Milky Way.;1996-06-15 23:00:00;15 Seconds;Triangular shape blocking out stars in front of the Milky Way. My wife, three children and I were sitting on our front deck (facing North) looking at the stars. I noticed a black triangular shape flying across the Milky Way and blocking out the stars. I could tell it was triangular shaped because it was crossing the heaviest part of the Milky Way.  I pointed this craft out to the rest of the family and they all concurred that they saw it also. There was no way to tell the altitude of the craft but it appeared to be quite high. It appeared to be about the size of my thumbnail at arms length.  I don't know why, but I had an uneasy feeling about this craft, and mentioned out loud that I don't think that thing wants to be seen.  There were NO lights at all and no sound. The only way you could tell that it was there was from the stars being blocked out.  If you held a ruler at arms length, the craft went approximately 16 inches to the West and then sharply 90 Degrees to the South for about 12 inches until we could no longer see it because of the roof eave.  I ran across the deck and down the driveway to look but could not locate it in the night sky. I had it in sight for about 15 seconds.
