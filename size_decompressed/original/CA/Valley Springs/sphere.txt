White sphere turns orange.;2005-06-15 02:30:00;3 minutes;White sphere turns orange Saw light about 300' above foothills near location of fire previous day - thought it was a helicopter with a spotlight looking for smoke.  Light kept drifting northward towards me for some time and then I realized it couldn't be a helecopter because it was totally silent and the light much larger than a spotlight.  As it passed in front of me, some minutes later, it instantly changed from white to 'baby asprin' orange and kept its pace up the foothills in a northward direction until it was out of sight.   Since my camera didn't work right I didn't get a picture until it was only an orange dot in the distance.   Previously reported to MUFON, but I haven't been able to locate the sighting on their map.   Estimate diameter of the sphere is 8'-20'.  It was really fun to see it and then they seemed to acknowledge my watching, as it changed color exactly 90 degrees to my location in front of the house.;38.1622;-120.858
