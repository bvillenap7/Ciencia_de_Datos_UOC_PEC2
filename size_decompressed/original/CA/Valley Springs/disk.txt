I work consruction and we had to poor cement at 6:00 am. As i walked around to the driver side door of my truck, a light in the sky got my attention. At first i thought it was a holicopter but i looked again and the object was not moving but only spinning. it seemed like it had 2 lights as if searching for something moving left to right, and the right to left. the object was a disk shaped and dark, the sun hadn't risen yet so it was still a little dark. after about 2 minutes the strangest thing happened. as i was watching, the craft formed a cloud around it as to be hidden. i could still see the glowing light behind or in the cloud. but the light faded away. it was odd looking because it was the only cloud in the sky. the cloud soon faded away as well. my boss which was driving seen the same thing. and a guy at the job sight seen the same as well.
