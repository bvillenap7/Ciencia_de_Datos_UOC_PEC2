Family of four sees bright flash in night sky.;2006-06-18 01:10:00;2 seconds;Family of four sees bright flash in night sky. At 1:10 am, sunday june 18th 2006, my sister, mother, father and i were sitting outside facing east looking at the stars and talking, when suddenly we all noticed a bright flash in the northeast approxamitely 35 degrees above the horrizon.  I looked up and saw the flash fade out.  Once if faded to a certain extent it moved to the right (south).  If u held a ruler at arms length it moved approxamitely 5 inches.  After it moved the the right it completely vanished.  All 4 of us saw the flash but i am the only one who saw the movement to the right.  I am the only one who doesnt have to wear glasses though, so this could be of the impairment of their vision that they didnt see it.  My father commented that it could be an iridium flare that we saw flash in the sky.;38.1622;-120.858
