fast criss crossing lights;2009-02-28 22:05:00;5 minutes;fast criss crossing lights My son was coming home from his girlfriends house late at night and noticed some lights in the sky.   The lights were ahead of him.  There were initially 4 lights and then there were 3.  These lights kept criss crossing extremely fast.  He pulled over, turned off the car and watched them.  They were heading toward Pardee Lake outside town.  This happened on a 3 mile stretch of back road.  There were no other cars to witness.  My son was very scared when he arrived home.  He ran in the house and went out the back door to see if he could see the lights.  The lights were gone.;38.1622;-120.858
