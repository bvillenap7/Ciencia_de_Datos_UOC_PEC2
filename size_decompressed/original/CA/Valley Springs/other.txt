Object sighted, no sound, no lights;1998-06-15 21:30:00;Unknown;Object sighted, no sound, no lights I was laying on a fold-up bed, on my parents front porch.  I was 16 at the time.  My older brother and his friends kept trying to scare me from under the porch, so I went inside the house to tell my dad to come tell them to stop.   Returning to the porch, my dad sat on the porch swing and I returned to the fold-up bed.  He told them to stop, and they went to the back yard.  We then sat on the porch looking at the stars discussing the milky way.  I do not know how long we were out there before we both got up to go inside.   I then saw an object shaped like an egg but, slightly flatter, not really a saucer shape.  It had no sound, no lights, left no trail and could have been missed if not for the light from the moon.  It came from the north east, over the neighbors house, and headed to the south west.  It was barely above the power lines. It appeared to have a brushed aluminum appearance, with no seams.  We both stopped and I said to my dad, Do you see that?.  He said, Uhh huh.   After the object passed over the house and was not in sight anymore, we went inside.   The strange thing about this incident is that we never spoke about it for five years, and my father does not remember the incident.  He does not deny the incident, he just doesn't remember, which is very strange.  In addition, I have no idea how long the incident lasted.
