Very bright light seen in California sky.;2003-09-10 05:10:00;2 minutes;Very bright light seen in California sky. I was looking around at trees and such waiting for a ride to work. I looked up at the Moon and the clouds surrounding it and a break, open sky above me. I noticed a very bright object, bigger than any planets would look. As I watch it travel from north to south the glow lasted about 10 seconds and lowered to just a tiny speck in the sky. I watched it travel south and it again got very bright for about ten second then back to a tiny speck. An Airliner was then coming from west to east. They fly this pattern all the time. I noticed another plane behind it and higher up. It turned in the direction the light was traveling (south) and I lost both to the clouds. The pilot of the Airliner should of seen this or maybe passengers, the plane would most likely of come out of Oakland, San Francisco or San Jose California.;38.1622;-120.858
