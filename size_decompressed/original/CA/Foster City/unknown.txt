Undeniable stationary flickering speck;2007-08-19 15:32:00;20 Seconds;Undeniable stationary flickering speck At 3:32 PDT on 8/19/07 near Edgewater Boulevard and East Hillsdale Boulevard I was on the walking path headed east with Max, a leashed dog I was walking. There was a loud propeller airplane, a unique design that had wings in the rear of the fuselage, probably flying out of San Carlos airport.  I looked at the plane and noticed a stationary flickering speck in the sky.  Foster City is the approach to SFO, and there is no way what I saw was a commercial aircraft.  It was a stationary flickering.  The weather condition was brilliant sunlight facing the object, a quarter moon visible, clear blue sky.  I pointed to the object and mentioned to an elderly male and female couple with a small white leashed dog to look, and had a line of sight to the object, they mentioned it must be the plane that flew overhead seconds earlier, they made no effort to locate the object.;37.5549;-122.2708
