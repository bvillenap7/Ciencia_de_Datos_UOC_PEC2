Green glowing square/rectangle shape with trail seen 11/25/01, Foster City CA;2001-11-25 20:45:00;5 seconds;Green glowing square/rectangle shape with trail seen 11/25/01, Foster City CA Two adults saw a green glowing box-shaped object with a trail track across the sky from about northwest to southeast.  We were sitting in a car talking and it appeared over and behing some nearby homes.  It tracked quickly from upper left to lower right sky and disappeared from our line of sight behing a house. ((NUFORC Note:  Very good witness, although she reported that she thought the object was traveling to the south.  We believe the object was moving to the north, when viewed in the western sky.  Object may have been a meteor, but we are uncertain, given the other reports we received from other parts of the U. S., Canada, and Brazil for this date.  PD));37.5549;-122.2708
