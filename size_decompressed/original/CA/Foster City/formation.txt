Orange objects in formation spotted in the Bay Area, CA by a skeptic.;2013-08-30 21:30:00;5 minutes;Orange objects in formation spotted in the Bay Area, CA by a skeptic. I live in a suburban area.  At this time it was dark, with a few streetlights as well as lights on the walking paths into the neighborhood.  I was turning onto my street after dark and happened to look out the window and observe some lights in the sky.  They were oval shaped and a little fuzzy, and it looked like there were about seven total in a formation.  What struck me was that they were glowing orange.  I live near an airport and these were not commercial planes.  They made no sound and left no trails in the air.  My first thought was that they were Chinese floating lanterns.  It was at this point I noticed they picked up speed (they had been sort of slowly meandering) and I rushed to park and get a better view.  The experience up to this point had been about three minutes.  It took me 30 seconds to park and I never stopped keeping tabs on them. At this point I mentioned to my companion, who had been seeing all of this and was confused also, that they were picking up speed.  I also noticed two other cars slowing down to point and look.  I ran under a tree and into open grass to get a better look.  There was NOTHING in the sky, other than stars, the moon and a few commercial planes.  I looked in the direction they were heading, and then frantically in every other direction from every angle, and saw no sign of them.  I don't really believe in aliens, but a UFO is not defined by being piloted by an extraterrestrial.  I do know that it was very out of the ordinary, very strange, and very unsettling.  I found it odd that I am able to find no one else discussing this online today, and no news stories.  I also feel I should add that when I finally went into my house, my cat was staring out the window and was visibly keyed up.;37.5549;-122.2708
