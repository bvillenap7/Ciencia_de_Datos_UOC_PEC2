Silver cigar dissapears reappears and then dissapears again.;2006-06-18 12:30:00;30 seconds;Silver cigar dissapears reappears and then dissapears again. I was outside my house. It was a beautiful sunny summer day. I looked up and saw a plane like object and I thought, That's cool, that plane is positioned so it looks like it has no wings. It was a little bigger than a cesna plane. Then it turned so the sun reflected off it from left to right and I could see that it had no wings or tail for that matter. I could see in the light reflection that it was made of silver metal panels and I could see where one panel ended and the other began. There were four panels on the side facing me. It moved a little bit more and the sun reflected off it again from left to right. For that to happen it had to make a turn that a regular plane cannot do. Then it started to fade in the front portion and it continued to the back untill it dissapeared completely. It was like it went behind a cloud but there were no clouds, it was a beautifull blue sky. Then it reappeared in the same manner and the dissapeared the same way and never came back.;37.6196;-122.4816
