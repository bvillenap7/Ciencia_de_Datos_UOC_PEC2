Large light appears as work lights,several small lights all around. The small lights occasionally moved to the larger lights,very fast. These were observed on several occasions. Location was also Daly City, at old 101 hwy. All sightings were late october thru March. I have observed these lights or ships, moving sporadically along the shoreline, also flying over the mountains near S.F.CA. My nephew has seen these objects many times. Nephew has a pager and cellular store in Pacifica. I was helping with the store for 2 years.  Triangular objects seen also.;37.6196;-122.4816
4 orange bright lights appear from the west, hoover and then they all dissapear.;2013-12-31 18:20:00;5-6 minutes;4 orange bright lights appear from the west, hoover and then they all dissapear. Was out gazing at the stars on this clear night. I then gazed towards the north-western sky and began seeing what at first I thought was a plane coming from the west towards me.  Suddenl, that light, which was mostly orange & red began slowing down and came to a full stop.  Within some 15 seconds a second one approached and it too came to a stop at what appeared a safe distance from the first.  Then about 30 seconds later a third appeared and came to a stop down from the other two lights.  The three combined lights formed a perfect diamond.  Some 30 seconds or so later the first light started to become dimmer until it disappeared.  The two other lights did the same and also disappeared. Finally about a minute later a 4th light appeared and came to a stop at about the center of where the three previous lights had been.  It hovered there for a good minute before it too started to become dim and it too disappeared. My wife and son along with our granddaughter saw these lights.  They did not get to see the first three, but did see when the two were disappearing and also witnessed the fourth light. Anyone else witnessed this sighting this evening?;37.6196;-122.4816
