Green-white intense light darting horizontally across the clear evening sky.;2002-03-19 19:30:00;2.5 seconds;Green-white intense light darting horizontally across the clear evening sky. Four of us were standing in a backyard talking when myself and a friend, both facing toward the East, observed a green-white fireball cross the sky.  The other two people present had not seen it as their backs were turned away from the object.  The intensly bright green-white object flew at a slight arc from the North to the South and faded as if going into a cloud or fog bank (we're on the California coast).  The object left a slight trail similar to one you might see during a meteor shower.  The object was much too large to be an airplane light or distant falling star.  The object was about the same size of a streetlight at night that would be about two city blocks away. The green and white colors blended together yet were intensely bright.  Imagine, if you will, an electric lettuce leaf - that kind of blended coloring.  The green coloring was brightest toward the outside of the object (outlined). The speed of the object was very fast, much too fast for an airplane.  My friend immediately mentioned the lack of sound. Coincidentally (?), an earthquake occurred three hours later with the epicenter being here in Pacifica, California.;37.6196;-122.4816
