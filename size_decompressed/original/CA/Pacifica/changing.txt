I then saw a blue line in the sky, on a cloudless night.  I ran upstairs to get my father. Looking out the window, we told my mother to go get the bonculars.  While she was gone, the blue line in the sky, was now starting to arc flashes of white light coming from the blue line.  There was smoke coming from the blue line, as the smoke thicken, the craft appeared, motionless almost squared in shape with a round white top, this craft had serveral landing gears all around the object.  In size comparson, I would say that it was like a delivery van.  As this craft was sitting motionless in the sky, a smaller craft appeared caddy corner, which could have not been more that 20 to 30 feet from the first craft.  This one had no light, and was about the size of a car.  As the smoke disapated, the crafts were gone.  There was abosolutly no sound, this all happen before my mother could get back with the boncluers from the living room.  No one from our town reported any strange sightings, however there were two sightings from the next town over, Montera. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));37.6196;-122.4816
