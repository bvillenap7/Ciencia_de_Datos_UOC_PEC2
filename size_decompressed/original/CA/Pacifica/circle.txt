We got our telescope and focused in on the object.  It was clearly a UFO.  It looked like a circle/sphere shape.  It had bright white and yellow glowing lights around the perimeter of the circle.  There were two straight long lines in the middle that moved like clock hands, back and forth.  It hovered for about an hour from when we spotted it.  Then, in a split second flew away out of sight.;37.6196;-122.4816
We had a UFO sighting last night at 8pm above our home in Pacifica, CA.

This is a drawing of the image, focused through our telescope.  The sphere was very small to the naked eye and appeared to be still, at first.  We thought it was a planet and nothing special. But the sun was still up and it was still daylight for another hour.  I wondered what planet it was, as it was almost directly overhead.   I took out the telescope and when focused, discovered it was moving very slowly.  It took about a minute to move across the lens frame.  I kept moving the telescope to keep it in sight.  It travelled very slowly in a southern path along the pacific coast.  It had to be at a very high orbit to move that slowly.  We watched it until dark, when it disappeared by getting smaller, presumably by gaining altitude.  The lights were not visible to the naked eye, because the object was too high.  The focused image in our small telescope appeared with the distinguished bright lights in an arc along the top, and dim along the bottom.  The image in the center changed form, but generally resembled a T.  The base of the T pointed in different directions, from straight down to about 4 o'clock.  The lights did not move at all, the sphere did not appear to rotate.  It was a perfect sphere shape, there were more details on the surface that were changing or indistinguishable, not drawn here.  I wish we had a camera telescope.  This was truly the most amazing thing we have seen.;37.6196;-122.4816
Bright orange/yellow sphere low on horizon sky/ocean at 4am off coast of California.;2019-01-03 04:35:00;20 minutes;Bright orange/yellow sphere low on horizon sky/ocean at 4am off coast of California. Bright orange/yellow object either very low in sky or on horizon/ocean.  Pointed telescope at it - perhaps a star?  Seems way too bright/orange for a star though.;37.6196;-122.4816
Circular red object hovering over Pacific Ocean;2020-12-08 02:00:00;30 min;Circular red object hovering over Pacific Ocean Observed bright red circular shape over the Pacific Ocean hovering for at least 30 minutes, visible to naked eye. It was very clear night with no clouds and the stars very clearly visible. The object was brighter than any stars. There were a couple of lights from ships visible on the horizon in that sector, which are normally present in the area. The object appeared above them and was hovering, or maybe moving very slowly. It was slightly flickering, but not blinking. If it was helicopter-sized, it would be at least a couple of miles off shore. Several pictures and short video are available.;37.6196;-122.4816
