Bright neon green orb.;2019-04-07 03:30:00;1 second;Bright neon green orb. I was driving around 3:30am from Los Angeles to Mammoth and when I was on Highway 14 north just past California City, a bright neon flash of light zoomed overhead in a split second going the same direction.  It seemed quite low to the highway just above the car going very fast and made no sound at all.  It looked as if a green glowing ball of light zoomed the same direction north over the highway above my vehicle.   There was only one other vehicle on the highway behind me by half a mile.   The only reason I noticed that bright green light was because there were no other vehicles on the highway and it was dark.
