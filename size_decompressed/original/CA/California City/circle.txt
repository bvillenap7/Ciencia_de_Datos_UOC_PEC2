Round white disk in one spot for 15 minutes;2020-07-07 07:00:00;15 minutes;Round white disk in one spot for 15 minutes Just a simple circle (solid), white in color, stationary NE of my location.  Event lasted about 15 minutes then just vanished.  Looked like a white dot in the sky after sun up (broad daylight).  Not a weather balloon.  Weird.  I don't even believe in this stuff.;35.126611627907;-117.964469767442
