5 large red/orange hovering lights east of California City;2003-11-04 05:27:00;5 minutes;5 large red/orange hovering lights east of California City HWY 58 Eastbound. 1 mile east of the town of Mojave. While my wife and I were on the way to work (two seperate vehicles)I looked east towards Cal City Prison where my wife works, above and far off in the distance to the left of the prison I observed 5 large red/orange lights almost in a V shape except there were 4 lights on one side and one on the other. I called my wife on the cell phone and I asked her if she can see the lights, she said yes, we have never seen anything like this before. I was on the way to Edwards AFB where I work and am fimiliar with aircraft lights. The lights seemed to hover but were not stationary to each other. After watching for about 3 minutes the lights started to vanish one at a time starting with the long end. After the 5th light went out we kept watching and the 5th light appeared 2 more times withought the others then after a couple of seconds they were gone.;35.126611627907;-117.964469767442
