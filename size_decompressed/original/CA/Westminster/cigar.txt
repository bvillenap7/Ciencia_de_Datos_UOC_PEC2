cigar shape floating silently through night space.;2006-11-18 21:05:00;10-12 minutes;cigar shape floating silently through night space. stepped out for a smoke, looked up to maybe catch some of the meteor shower, saw what looked like a long rectangular-rounded object- looked at first like wings of an airplane but with no body or tail-moving slowly NE to SW and seemed to float across the sky higher than an airplane would fly. it was a soft gray color with no lights of any sort, but seemed to be reflecting the city lights below with a little bit of haze in the air. seeming higher than an airplane, it still apeared to have the length just short of a full moon. i got my binoculars and watched as it seemed to rotate 90 degrees and back again and yet with no pattern or controlled movement- as if it were merely floating silently through the night. as it rotated it looked, through the binoculars, as if it had a more of a shape of a passenger jet fuselage but with no wings, tail or distinguishable markings. as it crossed the sky and passed about 60 degrees azimuth(?) it veered in a more southerly direction and out of sight. the entire time of viewing was maybe 10 minutes.;33.7518;-117.993200000001
