I was looking for about 30 seconds for a trail but I didn’t see one develop till about a 45-60 seconds.  It started getting longer slowly but almost imperceptible but definitely larger than when first spotted (very bright both tail and object).   Both my girlfriend and myself were wondering what it was.  I said I’m going to video it, turned on my Iphone camera looked up and then it just faded or (dimmed out) to nothing.  The fade or vanishing took about 3-4 seconds. That was it. I suspected some test aircraft and sun reflection fading but I don't know.;33.7518;-117.993200000001
