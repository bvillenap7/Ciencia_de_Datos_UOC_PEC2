Noted fast streaking ball of light moving south over Westminster, CA before disappating;2006-02-09 18:30:00;1-2 seconds;Noted fast streaking ball of light moving south over Westminster, CA before disappating Looking east from Golden West/Garden Grove Blvd I observerd a streaking ball of light that disipated like a meteor. It was moving quickly southbound between Golden West and Beach Blvd passing over the 22 FWY. The object was going level to the ground until it disappeared. I thought it was a meteor as its POV to me was near 45 degrees elevated.  Never would have thought to report to NUFORC from my POV without reading the 2-9-06 Garden Grove report. The time was esimated, it was just past dusk and it seemed like a shooting star;33.7518;-117.993200000001
