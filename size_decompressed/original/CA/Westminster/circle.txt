Bright object breaks up over Orange County sky;2003-12-23 22:20:00;5 minutes;Bright object breaks up over Orange County sky I was out back and looked up almost 90 degrees and saw a bright round object moving from South to North.  As it was at 90 degrees my son joined me and we both observed bright pieces moving West from the main bright spot.  It than seemed to break up and the light faded out.  I suspect that this was something going through re-entry, but I do not understand how the pieces moved away from the main unit at a 90 degree angle.;33.7518;-117.993200000001
Red glowing object traveling through the Westminster California sky;2012-07-04 21:00:00;3-5 minutes;Red glowing object traveling through the Westminster California sky It was a round object that flew for awhile with a red glow.  It floated through the sky and hovered for a bit and then slowly moved forward in direction and then disappeared out of sight.  We thought it was an aircraft until its flight patten was unlike a normal aircraft and we all took pictures and realized its origen was very unlike anything we've ever seen.  Please see our picture blow up and it's an image of some type of unknown energy source flying through the sky.;33.7518;-117.993200000001
