Twin orange balls seen over Westminster Ca;2006-05-04 22:40:00;40 seconds;Twin orange balls seen over Westminster Ca Unidentified object in night sky  Thursday, May 4 , 2006 @2240 hrs    I was standing at the N/E corner of Westminster Ave and Golden West St (33‘ 45“ 35.14* N and 118‘ 00“ 24,65* W).  I had just bought a cup of coffee and a do-nut.   I saw a object in the sky about 45 degrees above the horizon in a N/W direction from where I was standing. It was off in the distance and I would estimate it at about five thousand feet.   It appeared to be two orange balls that were close together and  were blending together.  It appeared to be hovering. There was no noise.   I watched it for about thirty seconds then saw  a green object fall from the bottom of it and move off in a S/W direction (relative to the orange balls) into the cloud cover and disappear.   After about another ten seconds another  green object (like the first but not as bright) dropped out of it and moved off in a N/E direction (relative to the orange balls) and again disappeared into the cloud cover.  After about another ten seconds the orange balls slowly faded out and disappeared.    At the time there were two search lights (like the ones you would see at a grand opening of a store) scanning the sky about ten degrees to the left of what I saw (east of my location).;33.7518;-117.993200000001
