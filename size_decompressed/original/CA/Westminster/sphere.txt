The lights traveled too straight and too evenly to conventional aircraft.  ((NUFORC Note:  Cluster of Starlink satellites.  PD));2019-11-11 18:00:00;45 seconds;The lights traveled too straight and too evenly to conventional aircraft. I saw about 20 bright yellow spheres traveling North to South in an exact straight line very close together in the sky over my house. They did not vary in speed or interval and maintained a constant speed the entire 45 sec until they were out of my sight. There were no mountains or buildings to block their travel. They just disappeared as they went farther away from me. They were not going at a particularly high rate of speed.I am a retired man living in So Calif.;33.7518;-117.993200000001
