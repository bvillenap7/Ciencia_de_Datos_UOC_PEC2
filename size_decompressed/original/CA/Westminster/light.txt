It was coming from the South West, a compass reading of 225 degrees and was headed North East, a compass reading of 45 degrees. It was January 26, 2000 at 7:10 PM (PST) when I observed an unusually bright pure red light by itself, it was the size of a pea held at arms length. It was coming from the South West, a compass reading of 225 degrees and was headed North East, a compass reading of 45 degrees. I was observing this unusually bright pure red light, waiting for it to turn or pass over me to see if it was an aircraft with the typical complement of flying lights. I watched this object for two minutes, then my daughter called to me and I looked down to her for two seconds. When I then looked back up at the red light, it was no longer there, instead there was a bright white cloud, it was the size of a silver dollar held at arms length. I ask my eight year old daughter to look up at this bright white cloud and I pointed where this bright white cloud was. After two minutes the white cloud had dissipated.  There was no sound of an explosion.  I live in Westminaster, California where I observed this red light.  To me this red light looked like it was coming from Long Beach, California and when it disappeared it was over Huntington Beach, California.  After the white cloud dissipated my daughter went in the house and I continued watching for another ten minutes, but the red light was no longer visible.  I live seven miles away from MacArthur airport and see airport traffic almost every day for the last fourteen years.  I was enlisted in the United State Air Force for five years, stationed on five different bases including one base over seas, been to several air shows and familiar with all types of aircraft.;33.7518;-117.993200000001
Enormous oval shaped light, flashing on and off, illuminating through clouds as it moved at high rate of speed through sky.;2013-06-20 23:50:00;30 seconds;Enormous oval shaped light, flashing on and off, illuminating through clouds as it moved at high rate of speed through sky. I am a retired lady, in my 60's and have been a star gazer and observer of aircraft or anything in the sky for many years, but I have never seen anything like I did last night. About 11:50 PM Thursday night, I was taking out some garbage.  The sky was mostly clear with some light clouds.  Air was calm.  I looked up in the sky and saw a flash of light through the clouds.  The light flashed on, then quickly off.  It flashed on and off again within  seconds, but was already quite a distance south of where I first saw it.  It continued flashing and moving north to south, until out of sight.  I did not see any craft or what might have caused the light. The light illuminated an oval shape through the clouds and larger than anything I have ever seen in the sky before.  I don't know the dimensions, but it dwarfed any aircraft I've ever seen.  You could compare it to a honeybee on a football.  There was no sound at all.  There is no aircraft I know of that could illuminate such a large area.  Could not tell how high it was because it was above a line of clouds the whole time, but just above the planes flying in the area, which were clearly visible.;33.7518;-117.993200000001
Single craft bright red and green lights moving very fast and changing directions often.  NOT helicopter RC?  Too fast I say?;2014-01-18 22:30:00;1 minute;Single craft bright Red and Green lights moving very fast and changing directions often.  NOT helicopter RC?  too fast I say? Red and Green lights moving very fast and changing directions often.  Could not tell the elevation?  If it was RC it was FAST FAST?  I don't think so?  Drone?  Why the super fast zigging for drone??   Only saw less than a minute after first noticing but well may have been around prior length of time? I  used my phone to video for last several seconds but  the bushes  were in the way for most of video, super poor I'm sure.    This is a highly populated area in southern California just south of Los Angeles so I know many people should have witnessed IF it were very high up??  Any other reports tonight?  Maybe good video?  I would love to know WHAT it was!  10 30pm ish  Jan 18 2014 (sorry I forgot to look at the exact time);33.7518;-117.993200000001
Falling star slows to a halt then drops slowly until it is gone;2014-05-12 21:00:00;1 minute;Falling star slows to a halt then drops slowly until it is gone I was heading south on a residential street when I saw what looked like a falling star.  The bright light came down fast, like a meteor falling to earth, then slowed tremendously to look like a helicopter landing.  The direction it was in it would have been over the ocean around Oceanside/Carlsbad area. Once the object slowed and I realized it was a craft and not a falling star I recorded it with my cell phone.  It went straight down from start to finish, and once it slowed it did not change speed again.;33.7518;-117.993200000001
Deep purple light and no sound w tight/abrupt turn.;2014-12-20 21:10:00;1 minute;deep Purple light and no sound w tight/abrupt turn. Deep Purple light moving South w no sound....makes fairly abrupt turn and goes North-North East and  still no sound.  Considering rate of change and light intensity I expected sound from aircraft.  Also close proximity to 2 major airfields and hear/see alot of activity accompanied w noise.  The color of the light and absence of noise was awkward.  Noticed the color change from deep purple to light blue during the turn but went back to neon purple.  No strobing of the light like an aircraft wing light...solid purple light.
