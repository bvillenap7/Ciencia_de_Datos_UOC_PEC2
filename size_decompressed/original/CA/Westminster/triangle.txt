Three white lights in the shape of a triangle during the spacex launch.  ((NUFORC Note:  Separate rocket engines?  PD));2017-12-22 17:34:00;8 seconds;Three white lights in the shape of a triangle during the spacex launch. My son and I were doing last minute Christmas shopping at jc penny here at the Westminster Mall.  When we got out of the truck, we noticed the vapor trail from the spacex launch, so I was taking pictures of it to send to my wife, and I noticed in the picture three white lights in the shape of a triangle, so I looked back up to see them hovering and as I went to take another picture they simply vanished.  I would say I saw the object for about 8 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Vandenberg AFB @ 5:26 p.m..  PD));33.7518;-117.993200000001

Ran to front door and looked for it.  As soon as it shimmered I started taping it for over 3 min.  Then I called my neighbors who witnessed with me.  We also looked at it with a spotting scope.  We watched it over;33.7518;-117.993200000001
