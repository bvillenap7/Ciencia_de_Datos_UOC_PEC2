2 grey with black chevron shaped crafts racing over Westminster, ca;2012-11-11 22:50:00;20 seconds;2 grey with black chevron shaped crafts racing over Westminster, ca I was in my backyard using a star app on my phone.  As I was looking up I saw 2 grey with black chevron shaped crafts flying right next to each other at one point 1 wing overlapped other crafts wing.   They were going really fast flying in a straight line south never changing direction.  They seemed to be racing.  There was no sound of there engines.  I could hear a nearby helicopter but nothing from these 2.  I have never seen anything like it.  The only thing that I can come up with is two stealth bombers flying together.;33.7518;-117.993200000001
