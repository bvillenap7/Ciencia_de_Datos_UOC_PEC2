It made a left turn and passed my car.  It was coming down and I thought it was a helicopter.  It was about 200 feet above the ground, preparing to land.  It looked like an egg, dark  colored.  No noise whatsover.  I saw 2 windows square shaped.  A red light was shining from both windows.  I jumped out of my car and yelled Oh My God!.  I ran to the train track as I was yelling.  It immediately disappeared near a factory.  After a few seconds I saw it on the other side of the factory, but the windows were dark...it was like a shadow. No more light. Whoever was in it had become aware of me.  It made a U turn and totally disappeared after that. The size of the egg was about half of my car.;33.9452595238095;-118.081714285714
