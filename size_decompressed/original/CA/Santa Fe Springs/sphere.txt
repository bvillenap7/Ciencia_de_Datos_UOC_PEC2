Sphere like glowing objects hovering and then traveling in an incredibly fast speed then vanishing.;2010-01-09 20:00:00;6 seconds;Sphere like glowing objects hovering and then traveling in an incredibly fast speed then vanishing. n the past 3 years i have seen, what i believe to be UFO’s.  ALL the one’s that I have seen have been in the city that I live in.  They have all been sphere like objects.  They just look like glowing balls of light.  The first one I have ever seen was like a red or almost pink looking glowing sphere.  The other two I have seen where white lights.  They all seem to have appeared right in front of my eyes.  And as soon as i would look they look as if they would travel in an extremely fast speed and disappear.  The last one I seen in September was the one that stayed hovering above my boyfriends house in Santa Fe Springs, CA, the longest.  It must have been around 4 seconds before it took off in a straight horizontal line.  This one didn’t take off as fast at first but then suddenly disappeared. Im pretty sure it was a UFO.   Actually I am very sure. It’s when i’m looking for them when I feel they show themselves to me for a reason. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

UFO manuvering directly in LAX final approach;2010-01-27 11:00:00;3 minutes;UFO manuvering directly in LAX final approach While standing outside, I looked up and to the west to watch the aircraft on final approach to LAX. I am a pilot and always interested in aircraft.  The commercial traffic here is about 3,000 to 4,000 AGL as they approach straight in to LAX.  While looking at one aircraft on approach my eyes were drawn to a spherical reflective object directly above it approximately 1,500 - 2,000 feet.It was highly reflective and pulling very tight circles, very fast.  Far to fast to be a bird. To tight to be a conventional aircraft.  I watched this object do this for about two minutes before it shot to the SW at incredible speed.  My mind stuggled to comprehend what just saw.  Whatever it was it was manuvering directly in the flightpath of numerous aircraft in some of the most congested airspace in the U.S.;33.9452595238095;-118.081714285714
