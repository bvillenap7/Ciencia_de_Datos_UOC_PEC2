Light/bright sphere in sky.;2016-06-12 19:55:00;20 minutes;Light/Bright Sphere in Sky Sunday June 12th, 2016, 7:35 pm-7:55pm. While at work from 7:30pm to 8pm, I have to be outside to supervise scheduled walking activities.  At around 7:35pm, I hear a plane flying by, and I look up to see it and in the sky east of the moon, there is this shiny object or bright light looking sphere.  It appeared to be moving very slowly to the east then stop.  But at the same time there was some clouds coming from the east slowly and stop near the object.   I am assuming the clouds stopped due to the offshore flow coming from the west.  I thought it was too early for Venus or any star to come out with that much light in the sky.   So it seemed awkward for the object to be a star or planet.  At 7:40pm I go inside and comeback out at 7:45pm, the object is still there. I go back inside at 7:49pm then comeback out at 7:51-52pm and it is still there but no other stars or planets in the sky yet.  At 7:55pm, I look up for a few seconds then just as I was going to look away the object took off west and disappeared.  Let me explain “took off,” it was moving and quickly gaining momentum then sped off ultra fast until it literally disappeared.  The only thing I can describe the acceleration looking like is a top fuel dragster launching or a Javelin missile being fired, except 5-10 times faster.   I was in shock and could not believe what happened.   After that there was no object in the sky anywhere that I can see.  And there was no trail or sound.;33.9452595238095;-118.081714285714
