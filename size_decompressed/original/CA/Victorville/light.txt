Blinking star randomly, instantly, jumping about in an area about 20 to 30 deg. above Mojave horizon.;1971-06-06 21:00:00;30 minutes;Blinking star randomly, instantly, jumping about in an area about 20 to 30 deg. above Mojave horizon. Parked on a hill east of town, looking east toward Lucerne Valley.  We say what appeared to be a star about 20 deg. (two closed fists) above the horizon.  This star was blinking on and off, about twice per second. It was as bright as surrounding stars.  Initially, it was not moving, just blinking.  This is was caught my eye, the fact that it did not move.  Had it moved, I would have thought it to be a plane.  But it stayed it one spot for about 15 minutes, never moving.  We wondered what kind of aircraft could stay so stationary.  Even a helicopter would have moved a bit in 15 minutes.  Then suddenly the blinking star instantly moved from its position horizontally about 10 deg.  Then it instantly moved diagonally, then vertically, then one way or another.  It would hold in one position for a few seconds, then instantly move again.  If you imagine a piece of cardboard with many little white lightbulbs randomly mounted on it about one or two inches apart, and wired so you could light individual lightbulbs, and then you randomly light the various lightbulbs every couple of seconds, this would be an approximation of what we saw.  After about 15 minutes of this star jumping about, it moved to about 10 deg. above the horizon and then slowly moved away to the south, moving in the way an airplane would appear flying along, straight and even flight, no longer jumping about.

Yellow point of light with no marker lights that initially was seen moving and then remained stationary for over 3 hours.;2002-08-27 20:30:00;3 Hours;Yellow point of light with no marker lights that initially was seen moving and then remained stationary for over 3 hours. Upon arriving home from school, I observed a deep yellow light moving near Venus which hangs near the south-west horizon.  It wasn't as bright as Venus but brighter than any other star in the sky.  It moved in a North-Easterly direction until it reached directly overhead where it simply stopped.  There were no marker lights that you would normally see on a normal aircraft and it moved at a slower pace than most aircraft move over our skies.  In addition there was an unusual amount of aircraft in flight that night 11 at one point in time.  The object stayed overhead for quite some time.  Through binoculars, it was located near a dimly lit star where it remained until I went to bed, nearly 3 hours later.  Using that dimly lit star as a reference point you could see with the naked eye and especially through binoculars that the object was bouncing around, moving erratically in all directions, yet staying within a near proximity of the dimly lit star.  The object remained in this location until I went to bed, around 23:30 hours.;34.491677927928;-117.37413490991
TWO BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHTS LINE ABREAST APPEARED FOR 30 SECONDS OVER  A FIVE MINUTE PERIOD.;2004-06-04 21:40:00;5 minutes;TWO BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHTS LINE ABREAST APPEARED FOR 30 SECONDS OVER  A FIVE MINUTE PERIOD. OBSERVED TWO SEPARATE LIGHTS APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES NORTH OF VICTORVILLE, CA.  BOTH LIGHTS WERE BRIGHT YELLOW IN COLOR AND ONLY APPEARED FOR 30 SECOND DURATION FIVE MINUTES APART.  THE LIGHTS WERE APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES LINE ABREAST AND ONLY APPEARED FOR THE FIVE MINUTE PERIOD FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS EACH.  AS THEY WERE STATIONARY AT ABOUT 5000 FEET ALTITUDE, THEY DID NOT APPEAR AS MILITARY PHOSFEROUS FLARES OR LANDING LIGHTS.  WITH THE BRIGHTNESS OF MILITARY FLARES THEY HAD ONLY SHORT DURATION SO THEY DID NOT DEMONSTRATE THE QUALITIES OF A FLARE. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Numerous Moving Stars;2006-03-24 21:00:00;5 min;Numerous Moving Stars On 03/24/06 at around 9:00 pm., I saw what appeared to be a set of three stars moving very slowly towards the west.  I then saw 12 more stars following the first three with one being brighter than the others.  I had my binaculars and noticed that there was no set formation and could only make them out as being stars traveling in the same direction at a very slow speed. I watched them for about five minutes and as they traveled out of sight towards the west.;34.491677927928;-117.37413490991
Fast moving pinpoint of light moving and maneuvering unlike any aircraft known;2008-10-27 16:23:00;10-15 SEC;Fast moving pinpoint of light moving and maneuvering unlike any aircraft known I was sitting in my jaccusi looking up in the sky from my jacussi chair when I saw a very fast pin point of light  coming fron the north to south,  It caught my attention,  I followed it w/my eyes.  It slowed down very rapidly in an area to my knowledge which looked like over the mountians (Wrightwood) veered west in a sharp turn for a few seconds very fast as if getting a bearing and then continue south again dissapearing heading south.  Total time in view was about 8-10 seconds and  covered lots of area across the sky.  Altitude unknown!  In my viewpoint I assertained that from the angle of the sun I must have seen the underside of the ufo reflecting the sunlight as it was setting in the sky.   I have an A&P licence with about 13 years exp in the field of avaition.  I have worked for Alaska Airlines as an inspector and TWA as an aircraft mechanic the last 8 yrs.  Military helicopter exp as well.  This object was followed up around 10 minutes later by a military jet of unknown type...possibly a f16 coming from the west to east direction along the same path very slowly.  No other incidents noted as I continued to look for a few minutes longer.  This is the second time in my life I have seen somthing this nature.  I am also an amature astronomer with aprox 8yrs exp.  This was not an aircraft of common knowledge.  No strobeing lights were seen on the aircraft.;34.491677927928;-117.37413490991

There was no sound associated with object.  Object flew low in the sky.  Red light blinked out at about 40 seconds of viewing.  Turned on the police scanner and heard reports of it also in Baker, California, at least 75 miles away.

Bright light flashing into second story apartment before disappearing.;2015-01-01 21:00:00;1 minute;Bright light flashing into second story apartment before disappearing. My 16 year old daughter is really convinced she saw something paranormal and specifically stated that she is convinced that this light was neither an aircraft or stadium lighting.   She walked into our kitchen and noticed a huge light aimed into our window from the north- east.  It was too bright to see past it, didn’t move, and it was too quiet to be an aircraft.  She said she was surprised and stared at it hoping to figure out what it was when it flashed after 20 seconds of staring at it.  It wasn’t a flash like something passed in front of it, it wasn’t like a regular camera flash because it was a massive size, but flashed like it blinked or possibly took a picture.   She yelled, “What in the hell” and that’s when I got up from the living room to see what she was looking at.  She said it flashed once more and then it disappeared before I was able to see it.   We are in a second story apartment and she made it crystal clear that it wasn’t headlights either because shortly after it disappeared, a car drove down 11th street from the north.  This isn’t the first time she and I have seen something like this.  In 2010 we saw lights flying over that alerted the entire town and it was reported in the Dailey Press the following day with pictures.;34.491677927928;-117.37413490991
