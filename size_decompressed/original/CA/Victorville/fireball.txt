Dancing Fireball-type Lights with succeeding Flash, Sonic Boom.;2000-08-09 23:30:00;5 Minutes;Dancing Fireball-type Lights with succeeding Flash, Sonic Boom. Mr. R. called the MUFON-SB UFO Sighting Hotline to report that approx. 11:30 PM (PDT)on August 9th, his wife looked out the window and noticed one or two very bright white lights swooping back and forth in the sky and alerted him to the lights.  At that time he went outside his front door and was met by a blinding white light that illuminated his house and street.  The light suddenly went out and he noticed both his outdoor mercury vapor lights and street lights were out.  As he stood in the total darkness, he was again surrounded by the intensely bright light that lasted about a minute then once again blinked out to sudden darkness.  About a minute and a half later he heard a rumbling sound like a sonic boom but said it sounded more seismic, like the noise that sometimes precedes an earthquake, and his windows in his house rattled but the ground never shook.  Following the vibration, he looked towards the NE sky and saw what appeared to be two faint white falling stars that were falling side by side and disappeared at the same moment.  Mr. R. reported that there were no visual observations of normal aircraft or helicopters in the sky during the event and no sound was heard, with the exception of the rumbling. Additional Case Info: A few minutes later there was a small M2.4 earthquake about 30 miles away at 23:43 PM (PDT - 06:43UT), but due to the low magnitude of the quake, the sonic effects are not thought to be connected with the earthquake.  It is unknown whether or not the earthquake is coincidental or is somehow connected to the original event, as the two falling stars fell in the direction of the location of the succeeding earthquake.
