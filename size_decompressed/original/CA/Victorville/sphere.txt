How many people have to see them before the government has the ball's to tell the truth?  LOOK UP SEE FOR YOURSELF.;2005-03-08 09:30:00;30 MIN;How many people have to see them before the government has the ball's to tell the truth?  LOOK UP SEE FOR YOURSELF. I WAS WORKING OUTSIDE AT 9.30 A.M ON 3-8-05.I LOOKED UP AND SAW TWO SPHERES.MOVING SLOWLY OVER THE DESERT IN VICTORVILLE CA. NORTH-EAST TO SOUTH-WEST. THEY WERE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND FEET UP. THEY WERE METALIC OBJECTS, NO WINGS, AND NO VAPOR TRAIL. THEY WERE IN PERFECT ALIGNMENT FROM ONE SIDE OF THE HORIZON TO THE OTHER. I'VE SEEN THE OBJECTS BEFORE IN LAS VEGAS, AT THAT TIME THERE WERE ELEVEN SPHERES AND EIGHT WITTNESSES. THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO. HOW CAN SO MANY WITNESSES SEE THE SAME THING, AND THE GOVERNMENT ACTS LIKE THEY DON'T EXIST! GET REAL!!!! IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE, LOOK UP EVERYDAY. YOU WILL BELIEVE.

An unidentified object seen flying through the high desert of Victorville, California.;2012-08-11 04:35:00;30 seconds;An unidentified object seen flying through the high desert of Victorville, California. Earlier Saturday morning, I went outside to see if I can see any of the Perseid meteors. After seeing a few, I continued to scan the sky and looked straight up.  Somewhere around Andromeda and Pegasus, I see this &quotstar&quot or so I thought it was, start moving. I watched it for a few seconds, blinked to refocus, and still seen that it was moving. It moved in a straight line, slowly, no tail or tracer, not blinking, just white, small, and very dim but bright enough to be seen. Definitely an unidentified object, nothing I've ever seen before.  It continued for about half a minute, maybe a little longer. Quickly, I called out to my wife, her sister, and brother-in-law. Luckily, my wife and brother-in-law was able to see it in the direction I was pointing.  They spotted it and followed until it disappeared towards Auriga and Gemini.  It was definitely too high for ordinary aircraft. Very weird and an amazing event to have captured with our naked eyes.;34.491677927928;-117.37413490991
Bright metallic sphere object moving at extreme and slow speeds over Victorville, CA USA;2019-07-30 19:56:00;20 seconds;Bright metallic sphere object moving at extreme and slow speeds over Victorville, CA USA At the time of 19:56 near the city hall of Victorville, CA, a friend of mine and I were inside my truck facing the South-East direction as we waited at a stop sign to proceed on to the main road.  As I first came to the stop sign, I noticed an extremely bright metallic looking sphere in the sky that flew across at speeds much faster than the speed of any aircraft or missile that I have ever seen or heard of.  Its height was around 2,000 to 4,000 feet above ground and from checking 2k quality surveillance footage of our property camera that faced to the West.  I determined that the object did not come from behind me and perhaps from above me.  It flew to the East which was the direction I was facing at that high speed and then after nearing the 15 freeway a few miles out it began to dive at a forty-five degree angle at half of its previous speed until it was a thousand feet or less above ground and it nearly came to a full stop just outside of our view in which a large building was in the way of our line of sight.  As we drove past the building to get a better view, it flew away travelling at its top speed in the South-East direction.  The object was by far the brightest object in the sky shining a white/grey absolute metallic looking shine as if it was reflecting the sun.  At that time of day, the sun has just set behind the nearby mountains and was hardly visible at all.  The sky was mostly clear and there was still near full daylight outside.  As the IT tech for the large facility in which I work at here, I went back and searched all of the surveillance footage from dozens of high definition cameras, but sadly all except for one camera was aimed high enough to view at the sky which was the North-West facing camera which is the one I used to see if the object came from behind my location.  My roommate who was a Marine and I have never seen anything like that object online or from any other media source.  I can only wish that one of our cameras had caught that occurrence, the object was so vivid an! d pronounced that it would have spoken for itself on video as it was the brightest object I have ever seen in the sky other than the sun itself.  What is also interesting is that this occurred one day after the night a double meteor storm (Southern delta Aquariids/alpha Capricornids) was to be the most active.  This object did not act in any manner of a meteor, it was very low flying, greatly reduced speed, was visible for a large number of seconds and was undeniably metallic.;34.491677927928;-117.37413490991
