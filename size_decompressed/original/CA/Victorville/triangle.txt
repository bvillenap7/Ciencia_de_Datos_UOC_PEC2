Look like bright stars, except light is florescent bluish white color. 1st object-Due East 10 degrees to right of moon and about 35 degrees above horizon 2nd object-Due South near Taurus const. about 65 degrees above horizon 3rd object-20 degrees east of due south about 75 degrees above horizon  My wife and I have seen these objects every night since late July of this year.  The seem to be out every weekday, but not always on the weekends.  The first time we noticed them was when we saw one ascend to it's hovering position from the North to high overhead.  The object climbed in inchworm like motion, but in quick jerky segments until it reached its hovering position.  I know we have a private contractor developing an unmanned helicopter for the military which can fly at altitudes of 35,000 feet or more.  One of them had a hard landing near the Southern California Logistics airport (where the contractor is based) during the summer.  The Daily Press newspaper covered it but was not allowed to take pictures and they keep people from seeing it up close.  We are also not far from Edwards AFB, so I'm thinking they are testing some kind of Star Wars defense system.  I've actually looked at the objects with a telescope and they appear to shaped as flat slightly oblong disks shapes.  We have also observed flashed of light and objects shot from them (for tracking purposes, perhaps).  I contacted the Daily Press and spoke with a reporter who was going to check a source at Edwards, but he has not gotton back to me.  Anyone else seeing these things?;34.491677927928;-117.37413490991
