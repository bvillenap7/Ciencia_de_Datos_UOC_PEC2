I  noticed what seem like a single cloud in the sky kind of sitting there by itself but the shape of it got my attention.  It seemed to have somewhat of a cylindrical shape looking out of horizontally so I got my iPhone out and zoomed it in as best I could and snapped a photo of it.  I only snap the photo so I could zoom in closer and see the shape of the cloud but to my surprise after zooming it in this is what I saw and it is very strange to me.  The problem is I only zoomed in more after we left for work otherwise I would have really scrutinized this thing more and perhaps even try to drive closer to it but I did not know that I would see something hidden in that photograph.;34.491677927928;-117.37413490991
