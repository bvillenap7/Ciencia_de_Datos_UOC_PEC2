Three diamond shaped craft at high altitude west of Victorville Ca.  They were in a tight flight formation before doing a loop and then climbed out of sight.  The craft displayed aerobatic style flight characteristics ( like that of a blue Angle show)    Before disappearing into thin air , the sun reflected of the surface of the craft then they vanished. At first I thought they were birds until I noticed the sun reflecting off the top surface of the craft . All three flew in perfect unison and at those altitudes It would be rather hard to see birds flying.  Not to mention they were about 20 miles away from were I was standing.  I could see no vapor trails leaving the craft.;34.491677927928;-117.37413490991
