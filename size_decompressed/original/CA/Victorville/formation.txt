multiple contrailed objects falling together from the sky all turned at once  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flight of mil. aircraft??  PD));2004-04-23 10:15:00;3 minutes;multiple contrailed objects falling together from the sky all turned at once as i was traveling northbound on the 15 freeway, my wife noticed multiple objects, 4-6 of them in the clear blue sky with contrails moving slowly from the west to the east due north of our position. i explained to her the i thought it was a meteor that was breaking up in the atmosphere as it burned up. the contrails were long and flowing, but they dissapated awfully fast to be smoke and debris from a meteor. they faded more like mist. anyway, they continued moving slowly and as it appeared, randomly intertwining between each other as they fell. i thought it would be cool to get pictures. as i pulled over and got out, i noticed that all of them turned due north together and appeaered to be falling a t the same rate of speed, just away from us. i took three pictures and the objects faded into the distance. i was okay with the meteor idea right up until they all turned to the north. my wife thought that since there was gusty winds at the time that the wind had blown the falling debris to the north, but i explained to her that if it had been debris burning up from space, that the pieces were probably travelling at hundreds or thousands of miles per hour and the 40 mph gusts wouldn't affect them. not withstanding the fact that they were probably so high up in the atmosphere that the weather down here wouldn't even affect it or be close to the same for that matter. i got pictures! anyone else see the the objects?
