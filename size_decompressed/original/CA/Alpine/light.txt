I was driving along Highway 395 traveling south. I reached a point where the road run's along the edge of a steep bluff. I belive about 11, 000 ft. above sea leval. I felt annoyance and looked up and towards the right and seen a bright illuminated object moving at high velocity west, south west. um, the light seem to flash me like a glare. I watched it move peering at the shape wondering if I seen a satelite. I felt I seen a UFO. On reaching bridgeport I thought it followed me since miles away I thought I seen the object traveling east north east climbing in altitude. I seen my car had a dot I continued to notice when the car was parked. when I parked the car and walked away from it. I sensed something telekentic light occuring on the engine that would vanish abruptly. When I got to Bridgeport I thought I seen the object moving. I was completely alone on the highway 395 for some time and the jet fighter's didn't arrive until several minutes later.;32.8346090909091;-116.752009090909
cluster of 5 circular white lights;2005-01-03 00:35:00;20 min;cluster of 5 circular white lights Two of us traveling east bound on highway at 12:35am. First sighted white hovering light clusters to the south of highway above hills. Freeway was dark, few cars present. As we continued eastward spheres countinued to move north easterly. We noticed a large circle of light in the upper center of the formation with 4 circles breaking away and then moving toward the center becoming one sphere, repeatedly. As we moved toward our destination the formation seemed to follow us and hover above our vechicle. At this point, we felt as if we were being followed. We entered our garage and looked out the window viewing it above our neighbors home which still had exterior lights on. At this point we shut off all our lights and contiued to watch this unidentified object hovering in the same location. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
