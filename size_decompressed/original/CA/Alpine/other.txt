Red and silver ball seen over mountain town of Alpine, CA.;2011-08-14 16:50:00;5 minuts;Red and silver ball seen over mountain town of Alpine, CA. I was in the back yard and I looked up.  My fiance was down a hill about 20 yards away.  He was watering with a hose, and dogs were barking so he could not hear me.  I said several times, Look at the strange plane.  It has no wings, but he could not understand me, and kept on with his work.  I kept staring at the object. The object was a ball not quite the size of a basketball but larger than a soft- ball.  It was red and silver and looked like a crumpled sheet of tinfoil with red places in what appeared to be the indentations. It was moving east about the speed of a slow-moving plane.  (I later saw a plane in that area, and it flew quite a bit faster).  I don't think I looked away, but suddenly there was a smaller dark ball on each side of the object.  This configuration lasted about 30-40 seconds, and suddenly they all were gone.  No noise.  No speeding away ... they just disappeared. I immediately wrote down the time and date in case I would hear someone else talking about the same event.  I have talked to no one who saw this.;32.8346090909091;-116.752009090909
