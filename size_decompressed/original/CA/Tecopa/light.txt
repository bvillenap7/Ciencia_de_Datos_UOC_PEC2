Stationary light in Tecopa CA 4/29/01;2001-04-29 21:00:00;2 minutes;Stationary light in Tecopa CA 4/29/01 While visiting an outdoor hotspring, I noticed a stationary light approximately ENE from our position and about 40 degrees up from the horizon. It appeared too bright to be a plane.  It did not seem to grow or diminish in brightness for a full 2 minutes. Then, the light just seemed to quickly dim until it could not bee seen.  It didn't simply wink off, nor did it seem to fly away, it just seemed to shut off as one would see when quickly turning off a light using a dimmer switch. There was no sound heard, and the distance from us to the object could not be estimated.  As far as I can tell, the object could have been out in deep space or just over the hills in the distance.  I work a help desk for a communications company in Las Vegas. I was visiting the hot springs with two friends, niether of which saw this, as they were facing me, but there were four others there and one of the others also saw what I did.;35.9021;-116.1544
