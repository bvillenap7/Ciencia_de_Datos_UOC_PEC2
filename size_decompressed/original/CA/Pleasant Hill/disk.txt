Flying objects over Pleasant Hill, CA  09/14/2008;2008-09-14 10:40:00;15 seconds;Flying objects over Pleasant Hill, CA  09/14/2008 I was standing on the deck of my apartment.  Airplane fly over through out the day because I live in a flight pattern, and I always look up to see.  This morning I heard a plane but it was a passenger plane or that size, flying up high and as I looked at the plane, lo and behold if there were not 3 discs shaped “craft” flying behind this jet.  I could see they were probably higher in altitude they seemed to just follow along.  The were not flying in a “row” they were just 3, close in proximity and one of them seemed to be going back and forth, as if “playing around.”  I watched one of the “craft” fly up even higher and disappear as the other 2 continued following. Now this happened in a 15-20 second span.  They were reflecting light so they were solid.  Not birds, not balloons, no wings but clearly following above and behind the plane.  I wanted to run and get my camera but I knew that by the time I got it they would be out of view from my vantage point.  I am not crazy and actually feel crazy even writing this but it’s not the first time I have seen “ufo” activity here in this area and it is never reported on the news. I am curious as to why when I have seen objects/ufo's, that there is nothing, nothing! even in the newspaper.;37.9577;-122.0757
