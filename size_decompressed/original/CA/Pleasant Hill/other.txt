Aprox. 20 min ago, I was looking up at the sky when I noticed a very tiny dot that was not traveling in the same direction as the very light clouds we been having this afternoon.  Ran into my house to grab my binoculars.  Was in the house for 30 sec. +-,  When I returned the object was still in the same place.  Which was approx. the 11 o'clock position to the south west.  Stayed observing the object for approx. 20 min until me neck started hurting. I can best describe the object as having 6 sides which composed of 6 white orbs with 1 in the middle total of 7 orbs clustered together.  With only 1 of the outer orbs flashing on and off. My sister joined me about half way through this 20 min til the object was almost directly over head.  Tried taking photos with my cell phone. But Haven't had a chance to view it yet.  I hope this helps because I couldn't make this up if I wanted to.  But please try to track it yourselves. I wanted to report this to you asap. It's probably still there. Thank you for your time;37.9577;-122.0757
