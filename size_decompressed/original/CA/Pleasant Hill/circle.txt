Light, translucent with slight blue-green tinge, about size of normal full moon in mid sky, circling (round) our back yard in seemingly 300 yards diameter moving quickly - roughly at 100 mph - in counter-clockwise direction, above repeat above clouds with no apparent light beam from ground.  This event has happened multiple times, in past.  No aircraft in vicinity, although few aircraft in distance from time to time. Several houses in neighborhood. Possibly 60 degrees F temperature, white clouds moving slowly and changing shape at low altitude.  Appeared to be strictly a light.;37.9577;-122.0757

Possibly 60 degrees F temperature, white clouds moving slowly and changing shape at low altitude.  Appeared to be strictly a light.  Correcting original entry: light moved clockwise and light was within clouds, ie. it circled being clearly visible below clouds, not visible above clouds, and partially visible through clouds.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that an advertising light would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witness was looking at a genuine UFO.  PD));37.9577;-122.0757
