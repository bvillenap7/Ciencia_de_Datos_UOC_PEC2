((anonymous report));2011-06-30 01:00:00;5 minutes;Walking along the trail near pleasant hill middle school everything seems normal.  Till a brief silence i look around then feel a warm breeze in one direction on a cold night i notice a low humming noise..  I look up and notice the sky is completely dark i start freaking out and start heading back home..  I notice stars in the distance..  While directly above me is pitch black.  Then i feel and hear a large pulse..several lights come on in a triangle shape then disapear..  I notice the humming noise again this time.  It seems the nights sky is moving a dark large object was hovering above the night sky in the direction i was going.. I notice what i thought to be stars above me but they suddenly start pulsing on and off..  That is when i knew what i witnessed..  It kept moving past me.. i felt a warm pressure of air pushing down on me.  The rear appeared to have lights..as it kept moving i realized it was a form of propulsion as the object disappeared before my eyes in the sky..  I couldnt believe what i saw..  When i returned home 4 hours have elapsed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
