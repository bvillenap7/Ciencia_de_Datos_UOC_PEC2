Strange object left hole in the cloud;2006-12-31 22:00:00;2 minutes;Strange object left hole in the cloud We were camping in the desert just outside of Brawley CA. The sky had thick but scattered clouds and the moon was very bright. A dark slow moving circular object without lights was quietly moving just below the cloud line. It came towards our camp, stopped below a cloud and then took off straight up right through the cloud leaving a hole in the cloud it went through.  There were several families in our campsite and atleast 10 people saw it.;32.9760999999999;-115.5291
