Indiviual green lights that made a triangle , traveling at a good rate of speed.;2001-02-14 19:02:00;1 min;Indiviual green lights that made a triangle , traveling at a good rate of speed. Saw an UFO coming from the east, it had indiviual faint green lights that made a triangle. The reason it appeared to be a triangle is because it covered the stars and thus i was able to see a triangle figure. The object appeared to be large to medium. It was quiet in tone but could hear a constant noise that was soft,in nature. But defined there was some sound, but faint. The UFO then turned to the north. It appeared to be traveling at a good rate of speed. I then went inside to get my parents but when we went outside it was gone.;32.9760999999999;-115.5291
