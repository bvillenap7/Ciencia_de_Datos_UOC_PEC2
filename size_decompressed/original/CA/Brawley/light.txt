After the trip all my relitives drove convoy style back with us to Arizona.   About 10 to 20 miles before the Arizona, California border at Yuma we stoped at a rest area.  It was a hot afternoon and we all had to stretch our legs.   I don't remember who spotted them first but we all witnessed them.  Across the Interstate 10 (north) about a mile from the road was a red and white water tower.  The type used at airforce bases.  We saw 3-4 orange objects about 500 to 1000 feet above the ground.   What was weird was that they were not moving and they emited smoke slowly abouve them.  Each light would (burn) for about 8 minutes and then disapear.  As soon as one would burn out another one would apperar only in a different spot and remain still.  I don't know the length of this event because after about 15-20 minutes we left to Arizona.  But I remember still watching those lights while the sun went down and we drove away.  Some people I've talked to say it was a flare, and I think that is a good answer.  But I know that flares slowly desend or shot up and come back down.  Why did these objects remain still and not drop or desend slowly?    All I want to know is what those were and were they flares that never heard of before.  I would really love to hear from you guys.  Also I have the entire insident on VHS tape and my family can give details too.   If you are interested in this please e-mail me and I will send you a copy of the tape.;32.9760999999999;-115.5291
The light was traveling very fast and had no tail behind it.;2014-10-30 22:25:00;10 seconds;On 10-30-14, I saw a white light heading in the northeast direction.  The light was further away from me in the distance while I was looking south.  The light was traveling very fast and had no tail behind it.  I donâ€™t believe it was a meteor.  The light was traveling faster than airplanes travel.  I ruled out a satellite since I usually see them all the time.;32.9760999999999;-115.5291
