Bright flamelike silent flame-like object seen over central coast of California,;2014-11-23 17:45:00;2 minutes;Bright flamelike silent flamelike object seen over Central Coast of California On Sunday November 23rd, at approximately 5:45 pm, my wife, sister in law, and myself were standing on the street in front of my sister-in-law's home, which is currently under construction.  The sun had just set and as we were getting ready to get in our car, my eye was drawn to a bright flame orange object which was rising over the horizon to the north east of us in the just dark sky. Over the next 30 seconds or so the object became bigger and brighter as it appeared to get higher in the clear and cloudless sky.  As it got closer to coming overhead of our location it was clear it was not a plane, rocket, helicopter, of ballon. The object had no navigation lights, did not blink, was silent, had no contrail, and did not flame out like a meteorite would.  Its speed seemed to accelerate as it headed to the southwest, but was constant in its direction until it disappeared from view. The most compelling observation the three of us had was its orange constant flame orange color and unusual and possibly changing shape...  We were able to take several photographs which bear out the unique color of the object against the sky. I consider myself a bit of an aviation and space buff and this was unlike anything I have ever seen.;34.9122345;-120.4316645
