Observed wormhole open and close with ships coming through.;2018-07-07 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Observed wormhole open and close with ships coming through. While sitting outside enjoying the night sky a flash came from what I thought was a comm sat in the area I observed the planet alignment the year before, or so.  The time when Mars, Venus, Saturn  closest to this report date.  I saw what looked like an anomaly, like a rolling distortion in the star field, then the field began to roll back on itself and a opening occurred.  This was at some distance as that the craft that I observed coming through were large and different shapes.  Because of the distance, altitude, and angle size was distorted, but not with the sizes I observed.  These were transport size looking vessels the biggest would pale any aircraft carrier we have. My home back yard runs North / South. I observed the event looking to the South and at about a 45 degree up angle. Ships were crossing the N/S line heading towards the East.  The formation I saw traveled with several smaller ships in the lead, what looked like several larger ships alongside the large one one then several different sizes in formation above itâ€™s line of travel.   They just came through and kept going. A battle group, US Navy type would take some time, hours to do this. Their speed would have been very great, Space Shuttle times 3.  Oh, this was a very clear night.;34.9122345;-120.4316645

It flew steadily until it reached towards the hills, then took off, like in, star trek, really.  My neighbor, his son, and my friend were witness to this UFO.;34.9122345;-120.4316645
