Red vertical glowing light in the sky.;2007-04-18 05:30:00;3 TO 5 MIN;Red vertical glowing light in the sky. I saw a red line in the sky that did not move for a few minute's and then it vanished. It had no light's, wing's ect... it was just a straight vertical line that glowed red againsts the blue sky. It looked as if somebody cut a line through the sky.It was west of my house so it was most likely over the pacific ocean.

An od shaped object with lights along the bottom outline, that glided at high speed, yet disappeaered instantlly,;2008-10-09 01:00:00;15seconds;An od shaped object with lights along the bottom outline, that glided at high speed, yet disappeaered instantlly, I was outside with a friend smoking a cigarette. I look up in the sky and saw an object that was flying seeming low to the horizon. The shape was hard to describe but,destictive lights covered the out line of the bottom. It glided extremely fast.As i watched it by the time I told my friend to look it had disappeared to the east. as I was explaining to my friend what ihad just seen It had doubled back and my friend seen the object come back and then disappear this time to the north. We waited nevously to see if it would reappear but it didn't. Although it shape was not distictive it was not like any plane I've ever seen in this area. It was exiting yet very wierd to me. My sister believes very highly in ufos and such to a degree. Yet this has jolted my mind into thinking.;34.9122345;-120.4316645
Object seen moving very slowly over Santa Maria, CA.;2015-03-27 13:41:00;30+ minutes;Object seen moving very slowly over Santa Maria, CA. I was sitting outside of Panera bread with my dog on my lap and above him, I saw a momentary glint up in the sky like the sun reflecting off of a windscreen on a plane. When the object moved the glint disappeared and then would come back (I have a picture of it from a tracfone,).  I sat there and watched it slowly move across the sky from west to east and then back west and elevate altitude a bit. I guesstimate its elevation to be a few hundred feet. This is not the first time I have seen UFO's in this area.  It seems to correspond to the Vandenberg launches when I do.
