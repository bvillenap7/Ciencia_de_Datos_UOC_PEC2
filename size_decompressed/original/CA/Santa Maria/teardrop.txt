3  large orange teardrop shaped lights over Samta Maria;2006-10-18 19:45:00;10 minutes;3  large orange teardrop shaped lights over Santa Maria At 7:45 PM I took my dogs outside to urinate.  Noticed a large bright orange teardrop shaped UFO.   It made an audible grinding noise when it moved, but there was no noise when it was still.  The underside of the UFO appeared to be green.  It also had an aura around it.  It was coming twords my house.  It the distance, I saw a round orange ball with an aura around it going in the opposite direction.  (Moving south of Vandenburg.)   I called for my husband to come outside.  By that time, the orange ball was gone and the orange teardrop was moving away from us and getting smaller, looking like a ball.   Then out of nowhere, another bright orange teardrop UFO shot up into the sky.  By this time I was on the phone with the police department asking if anyone else had called in about these sightings.  (They said no)   We watched as the second UFO was out of sight and the third, follow in the same path of moving twords the house, hovering a few times, then moving away from the house going south, turning into a ball with an aura around it and vanishing out of sight.  It was CRAZY!  Unfortunately we couldn't find our camera to take a photo. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the orange objects might have been contrails behind high-altitude jets, and being illuminated by the setting sun.  Just a guess.  PD));34.9122345;-120.4316645
