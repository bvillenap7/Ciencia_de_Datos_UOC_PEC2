Large rectangular object with red blinking lights that formed an arch, irratic movements, low flying, suddenly disappeared.;2006-04-27 16:30:00;approx 1 minute;Large rectangular object with red blinking lights that formed an arch, irratic movements, low flying, suddenly disappeared. My boyfriend and I were driving home when we saw blinking lights in the sky.  The only reason why we gave it any consideration was because it was nowhere near the airport and very low flying (about 50 meters).  The craft was flying low over a residential area.  It was large, about the size of a jet.  There were many red blinking lights on the front side of the rectangle that formed an arch, and one red light on the back.  It made irratic movements from side to side, descended, then moved in a circle.  It then suddenly disappeared.  There were no other lights on the craft.;34.9122345;-120.4316645
