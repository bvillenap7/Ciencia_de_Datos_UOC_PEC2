I got out my 4-1/2 reflector telescope, but I could not find them in my spotter scope, so I ran in the house for my binoculars, the objects were still there but appred to have moved apart just a little. They did not twenkle like stars,just solid steady lights. I tried again to find them with my telescope (my spotter is durty and out of focus) I looked up with my naked eye to see how close I was and one of them was gone, that was about 20:40, it was only then that I noticed Jupiter was visable, I had no problem finding it with my telescope, then turned back to the last object looked at it then into the spotter scope again, still couldn't see, then look again with my naked eye and it was gone too, at aprox 20:45.;34.9122345;-120.4316645
