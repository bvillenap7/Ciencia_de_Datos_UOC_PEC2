Weird orange glowing ball of light moving slowly across the sky and gradually diminishes.;2012-02-06 21:15:00;45 seconds;Weird orange glowing ball of light moving slowly across the sky and gradually diminishes. At first we thought it was a weird plane but alas, no blinking lights and it was orange and glowing.  It moved across the sky from northeast to southwest and gradually diminished until we couldn’t see it behind the trees.   Seemed pretty close and definitely different than any falling star we’ve seen, plus it moved too slow and lasted too long.  Weird!;34.9122345;-120.4316645
A fireball in the sky floating.;2013-12-14 19:40:00;1;A fireball in the sky floating I was driving home from work I was about to make a right turn onto my street when I saw a big red fire ball in the sky.  It was red on the outside but looked like fire inside.   I pulled over and was trying to think if it was a balloon or lantern floating as a prank and pulled into my drive way and it was still floating.   I took a picture it you really can't see anything so then I ran inside to call my family to come see it and it was gone.  What a bummer they thought I was joking.  I don't really know how long it was there, but when i seen it and drove home must have been at least a minute.  I wasn't keeping track of the time.   I was just amazed on what I was seeing.  Sorry I don't have a great story but at least I can share this with people who will take me seriously.   Also, I live next to an airport and this object had no sound, no lights, and definitely was not flying by fast like the airplanes around here.;34.9122345;-120.4316645

The object flew from the western sky to the southern sky then disappeared.  The duration approximately 3 minutes. Then on 7/22/2015, at 22:30, I saw a identical object take the same flight path.  When the object disappeared in the same location I went in side to retrieve my phone.  Upon returning outside there was another indentical object taking the same flight path.  Then I called to my wife to show her.  When she got outside that was when I noticed five more identical objects fly across the western horizon eventually taking the same flight path of the other two objects and disappearing in the same location one after another.  The objects were orange fireballs.;34.9122345;-120.4316645

Tonight 9-10-15, my daughter asked what are those orange lights.  While driving to the store.  When I looked were she was pointing I noticed three orange fireballs/orbs.  Made a U-turn back home.   Upon arriving at home, I ran inside to inform my mother.  That is when she went outside. We watched the three orbs continue what was appeared to be a continuous elevation in the western horizon untill they disappeared in the same spot one after the other.
