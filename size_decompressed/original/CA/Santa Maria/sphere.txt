I was driving on US 101 headed north when all of the sudden a bright star looking object fell towards the horizon. It only lasted a few seconds, but I know it wasn't a falling star. From where I was no stars were visible, the view from the drivers seat doesn't allow you to see overhead, without leaning forward as far as possible, and I was sitting back in my seat. When I got home I immeditly looked in to the sky to check what the stars were like, it's a clear night and several stars a visible, but none including the north star were nearly as bright white as this. The object I saw in the sky fell in an arch from east to west, I couldn't tell you what kind of a degree the was arch was.  The sky was black ahead of me, there were other cars around, in front, behind and going in the oppisite direction. There were also a few street lamps, I had just past an on ramp and feet away from an off ramp and on the south bound side of the highway there was an on ramp near by. There was considerable light around other than the few street lights, both sides of the highway have near by gas stations, the north bound side also has a small well lite hotel, and Burger King. The object didn't have a trail of anything behind it. I've witnessed shooting stars and meteriors before and this was nothing like it. it moved faster than a shooting star. I don't know what else to say about it, except that I've never seen anything quite like it before.;34.9122345;-120.4316645

Wednesday July, 6 around 7:30pm there was a large sphere object at a really high altitude and floating without any movement what so eve;2019-07-10 19:30:00;30 minutes;Wednesday July 6 around 7:30pm there was a large sphere object at a really high altitude and floating without any movement what so ever, it was first witness by my nephew riding in my passenger seat as we were driving out of my drive way and he pointed out and said look! i stopped the car got out and started to see if i can zoom into with my phone camera (iphone 6s plus) right off the bat i knew it was not a weather ballon or a blimp.  it just had no movement at all.  it was close to the mountain range but not exactly over them.  i would to try to guess the size of it but it being my first object i see its just hard to try to compare its size to other things.  Its was a sorta like dark grey metal object. i dont know how it disappeared, it just did.  nor do i know how long it was up there for.  since through out the day there was suspicious jets and 1 black military helicopter that flew around the city and headed back to VAFB.  i do live approximately like 40 mins away from the base.  I was unable to find anyone else to se if they witness what i had saw floating up there, but there seems to be no one else that saw this or recorded it but me! i have my video and my photos ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to contact the witness, in order to correct the time and date, but have not heard back from him yet.
