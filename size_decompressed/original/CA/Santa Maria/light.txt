Three objects flew from one cloud to the other leaving a cish opening where the cloud appeared to have been disturbed.;2005-02-12 18:00:00;5-10 sec;Three objects flew from one cloud to the other leaving a cish opening where the cloud appeared to have been disturbed. Around the date posted cant rember exact date i was looking the sky at the clouds becuase we were getting strange weather latly and i was driving to work from Nipomo crossing the Santa Maria bridge.    And i see a white with blusih almost tinged light fly from one cloud into a larger darker cloud moving horizontally from my postion and perspective.   Then i saw another fly into the same area.  I was amazed at this and was estatic when i saw a third but this one decided to drop below it appeared the entrance of the other two then stop jet back and then enter at the same place in an almost z like path.   I thought i might have been seeing things when i realized that the cloud that appeared to have been entered from had a c opening where it had been disturbed and it was at its opserved entrance of the UFO's.  My work was but a mile from where i had seen them driving on the highway so i decided to look up and noticed that from the cloud density and the lights from the city it was a blurred effect of redish glow of indesrnable mush.  Not unexpected or surprising of course but it was a bit convinint that the city i see the UFO's pace over was masked in a storm cloud.
