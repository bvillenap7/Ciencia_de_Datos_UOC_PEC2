One white circular and three white rectangular objects without wings  flying at height of planes seen for 5 minutes Feb 6, 2021 at dusk;2021-02-06 17:15:00;5 minutes;One white circular and three white rectangular objects without wings  flying at height of planes seen for 5 minutes Feb 6, 2021 at dusk Saw Four white objects floating above the tree line of our back yard at 5:15 pm PST in El Cerrito, CA on February 6th.  The three small rectangular shapes were floating ahead of the larger circular shaped object for about 5 minutes. After all four objects floated past the tree line, the large object veered to the southwest in a turn to the NE and we couldnâ€™t see the smaller objects.  this appeared to be about as far up in the sky as planes fly, but none of the objects appeared to have wings or tails.  They traveled slower than a jet.  I took a photo with my iphone, but the detail of the three smaller objects did not show up in the photo. You could only see a circle with the camera of the larger object.   My brother and I, both college graduates, both observed this.  I called ABC news and reported it.  But they did not have any reports from others about it.  We have never seen anything shaped like this that moved this way before.;37.9145;-122.3007
