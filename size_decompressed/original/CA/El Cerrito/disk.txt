Rotating dics-like object with raised dome center over El Cerrito, CA on 12/15/2007;2007-12-15 18:15:00;4 minutes;Rotating dics-like object with raised dome center over El Cerrito, CA on 12/15/2007 I saw a flying saucer which flew and hovered over Richmond, CA on Saturday December 15th, 2007, around 6 or 6:30pm.   I was driving on Interestate 80 from Emeryvilee, CA to el Cerrito, CA, and while I was on the freeway, I saw a strange object in the sky moving from west to east.   It suddenly stopped and remained stationary, just hovering in the same spot for about one or two minutes and that's when I saw that it was a flying saucer.  It looked like a stereotypical flying saucer from a 1950s movie.  A rotating disc with a raised dome in the center.   Part of the dics was lit and I could see the lit portion everytime it rotated.  It also appeared to have a central light on top of the raised dome.   I was trying to take a picture of it with my cell phone, but it was too difficult to do while driving on the freeway at 70mph.   I exited the freeway in El Cerrito, but by the time I parked the car, the object was gone.   As soon as I got home, I searched the news and googled 'UFO sightings in Bay Area', but didn't see anything related to what I'd just seen.  So, I posted a rant on craigslist and about 8 people re-posted saying that they saw it too.   One guy SAID he was a scientists and said that we shouldn't be freaked out about it, stating that we're just one tiny planet in a universe full of solar systems and galaxies, and that we're probably not alone.   Another person re-posted and provided the NUFO Reporting Center website.  Anyway, I'm 100% serious, this is not joke, I saw a UFO.   Actually, it wasn't a UFO, because I was able to identify it - it was a flying saucer!!!!!   I'd estimate that it was flying about 1500 feet above the ground.;37.9145;-122.3007
This aircraft was making maneuvers that are not physically possible by any known aircraft in all the militaries of the world.;2012-08-30 18:39:00;5 minutes;This aircraft was making maneuvers that are not physically possible by any known aircraft in all the militaries of the world. It was foggy out, in the bay in the late summer early fall, the fog literally rolls right over the bay. It was late after-noon early evening.  The craft was blackish/greyish, with a glossy or shine to it. It was circular disk shaped, it was doing aerobatics, it seemed to be playing around.  The craft was very agile, turning very quickly,swiftly and gracefully.  It than proceeded to flip around or barrel rolled diagonally very sharply, it flipped around in different positions 3 times, i drew out a diagram and the directions of which it was conducting its aerobatics.  it continued flying at a complete vertical up and down angle before disappearing back into the fog.;37.9145;-122.3007
