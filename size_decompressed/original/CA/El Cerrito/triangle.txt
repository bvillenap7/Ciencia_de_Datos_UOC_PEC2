When we both looked out, we saw a strange black triangle shape craft flying slow in the sky above our house. It had three white lights on each of the corners and a big red light in the middle that flashed in a slow pattern. I looked through  binoculars and saw another small tiny shape that looked exactly like the black traingle except it glowed with all red lights. It looked like it was following the big triangle on the right side of it. We also thought we saw another white orb/craft that was also following it on the left side. It made a low, sound that sounded nothing like an airplane - almost quieter. These three crafts were moving and curving very slowly. Then, suddenly, they all simultaneously zoomed quickly out of our sight.;37.9145;-122.3007
