As I was driving in a N dir. on Hwy. 101 from my home in Santa Maria, CA  ((NUFORC Note:  Contrail in sunlight.  PD));2004-05-30 20:30:00;15 to 20 mins.;As I was driving in a northerly direction on Hwy. 101 from my home in Santa Maria, CA (about 8:30 pm on Sunday, May 30, 2004), and just before I reached Nipomo, CA, I spotted what appeared to be a red fireball with an extended tail, high in the sky.  It continued going in the same direction as I was, becoming smaller and smaller until it became a small white light just before it disappeared, which was about the same time that I reached the city of Arroyo Grande.  The sky was quite clear, so it was easy to see. I had at first theorized that it could be a plane on fire, but it never came down. Then I thought perhaps it was a meteor or shooting star - but it was still daylight, there were no stars yet visable, and it never disappeared as shooting stars do.  Then I thought of a missile from Vandenburgh A.F.B., but realized that they are usually shot off in a westerly direction (in case they fail, they will dump in the ocean and not hit cities, homes, etc.).  I still wonder if it was a missile shot off at an earlier date, that just happened to be low enough for me to see now. I have asked our airport tower - they have no answer.  I asked our college - noone knows there either.  I called my local TV station.  I don't know who else to ask.  Can someone explain this to me?  I would love to know what it was! ((NUFORC Note:  we spoke with this witness via telephone, and found her to be exceptionally objective and credible.  When we asked whether the sighting might have been caused by a high-altitude contrail, brightly illuminated by the setting sun, she allowed as how she thought that might be a possibility, and that others had proposed the same.  Just a guess.  PD));35.0307;-120.4972
Single Fireball looking thing over Nipomo, CA;2015-08-13 00:30:00;45 seconds;Single Fireball looking thing over Nipomo, CA. It was an orange fireball looking thing that started off very bright and dimmed as it moved a crossed (sic.  across)  the sky until it was no longer visible.   Probably some kind of meteor since there was a meteor shower tonight.;35.0307;-120.4972
