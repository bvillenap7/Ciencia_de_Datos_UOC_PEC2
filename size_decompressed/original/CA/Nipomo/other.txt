Unknown fiery object off coast in Nipomo, CA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus?  PD));2009-01-06 08:35:00;15 minutes;Unknown fiery object off coast in Nipomo, CA I was standing outside looking at the stars, smoking a cigarette and looking west toward the coast.  I saw a light and it moved to the north wildly.  I thought it was a plane or some small flare, something normal..   I stood there after finishing my cig and told my friend to come out and see if they saw the same thing...  She saw it, but told me she had seen it before...  But, this was about 700ft in the air, 5 miles from my sight, and it was moving sparatically inside the atmosphere...   Hopefully someone else saw this thing.  I have seen quite a few falling stars, the space shuttle, etc.   My friend still thinks it's a star or a planet..... ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus?  PD));35.0307;-120.4972
