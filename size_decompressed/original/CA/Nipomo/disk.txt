I was driving south on U.S. 101 near Nipomo.  The time was 10:10 p.m.  It was very near the Thompson Road exit.  After going up a hill, my car's headlights shone on what looked like a classic disc shape with a dome on it. It had horizontal slits on it that had some kind of lighting that can't be explained - somewhat similar to a cat's eyes when you shine a flashlight on them.  The object filled up the windshield view area.    When the car's lights lit up the shape, it flashed and then disappeared immediately.   This lasted only a few seconds, but it seemed like a long time.  Immediately I became very frightened. I drove quickly to get home.   There were several other cars behind me that had to have seen it, as well.;35.0307;-120.4972
