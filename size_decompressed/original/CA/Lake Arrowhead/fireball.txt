My Mother just told me that last night/this morning around 2:00 A.M. our house started to vibrate.  She thought it was odd when one of her wind chimes was making a humming noise without the clacker actually moving.  She proceeded to walk through our 3 story home searching for the source of the vibrational movement.  Having searched all of the rooms, and finding no one else awake (being that there were 4 other people in the house), and no source for the hum, she returned to her bedroom that looks out over the high desert (i.e. Victorville area) mountains and saw a green ball of light moving at a high rate of speed over the hills.;34.2641;-117.1996
