Mysterious lights over Lake Arrowhead, California, after July 4 fireworks show.;2014-07-04 21:30:00;15 minutes;Mysterious lights over Lake Arrowhead, California, after July 4 fireworks show. Two groups of light green/blue spherical lights appeared over the west end of the lake and traveled at a fairly high speed over the north side of the lake and disappeared in the east.  This was right after the fireworks display on the lake so several hundred people are potential witnesses.  I know several near us witnessed the phenomenon.

Two hundred plus, fast flying, green and some blue light.;2014-07-04 21:31:00;60 minutes;Two hundred plus, fast flying, green and some blue light We were out on the deck waiting for the fire works to start at 21:00 hours, facing south about 6,000 Ft. elev. on the North side of Lake, in Lake Arrowhead, CA.  We started counting satellites for about ten minutes at this time we notice some faster flying green one, then the fire work begin and during the show I was still seeing these fast flying green lights.  Just after the fire works ended, I point out two of these green light were flying in a straight line at 21:30 hours.   At 21:31 hours we saw 15 of them in a group heading in the same Northern direction over the clouds.  At 21:36 hours there were fifty or more flying over the Western side of the deck that I counted and some of the other witnesses on the Eastern side of the deck was seeing a bunch more looking to the Eastern sky.  At 21:45 hours another group filled the sky, blue in color now, some were about ten thousand feet and some up around thirty-thousand feet, there may have been a hundred of them.  They were not all the same shape, but flying fast and in a Northern direction.;34.2641;-117.1996
