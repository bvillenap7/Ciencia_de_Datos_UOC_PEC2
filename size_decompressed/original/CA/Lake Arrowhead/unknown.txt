I came back home about 3:15-3:30 a.m. and turned on the NASA TV live broadcast of the meteor shower.  I had been taping it for my kids so they'd have a record of the tremendous shower.   As I watched the live broadcast, a bright dot like a satellite appeared on the TV screen.  Cool! I thought, they caught a satellite on the broadcast.  The satellite, moving slowly, then proceeded to change directions on a few occasions before moving out of the range of the camera. Anybody else see this or tape the event?   Unfortunately, my home burned in the October 29, 2003 fires in Lake Arrowhead, CA, and I lost virtually everything, including the videotape of this mysterious object.  I'd love to know if anyone else saw this/taped this/has a copy of the tape.  Pretty hard to fake a live broadcast from NASA, you know? ((NUFORC Note:  Can anyone help this gentleman?  If so, please contact NUFORC.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports from same witness.  We believe that the correct date for the dramatic Leonid meteor shower, as indicated above, was November 18, 2002.  He indicated 2001 in the original report, and we have amended that report to 2002.

10:40 am over San Bernardino Valley, very bright light for an instant, then again seen further E and moving W, then vanished.;2015-07-11 10:40:00;Seconds;10:40 am over San Bernardino valley, very bright light for an instant, then again seen further east and moving west then vanished I was driving on Hwy 18, east from Lake Arrowhead to Running Springs, along the Rim of the World.  It wa clear and sunny, except for high cirrus. I topped at a turnout to take a photo of geo-engineered clouds, facing South.  When I began to drive East, I saw a very bright light flash in front of the clouds toward the south.  It was very small, but very bright white, brighter than a sun reflection off an airplane.  It was gone in an instant.  I stopped and looked, but could see no movement or airplane in the area. I continued my drive for approx. 1 mile, stopped at another turnout on the north side of the hwy, and took another photo toward the North. I then continued East on Hwy 18 when I saw another flash like the first.  This one was further east than the first.  I stopped in a turnout, and got out of the car.  I saw the bright light, then it faded to a black as it moved west, then a smaller flash and then it was just gone.  I looked at the area to see if it was an airplane between me and the clouds, but there was absolutely no movement of anything, and no more of the bright light. I was alone but I saw that two people who had been traveling west on Hwy 18 had pulled over on the south side of the highway and were looking in the same direction. I have lived here all of my life, and know what an airplane looks like from the Rim.  This was far brighter than anything I have ever seen.  It must have been pretty far away from me, but it was in front of the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.2641;-117.1996
