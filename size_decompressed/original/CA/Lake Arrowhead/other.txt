Moving star, among stars;2008-06-21 23:00:00;20 seconds;Moving star, among stars I have seen two objects in my lifetime. The last one was about four years ago, and I never reported it. I will report it here soon. I have to recall the details.  This one is the most recent. I have been camping and hiking for decades. I know what a falling star looks like this was not one.  My Girlfriend and I were camping at Dogwood, a popular camp site, three miles south of Lake Arrowhead. We were sitting in the forest, facing east, next to the fire ring (with fire in it), just chatting. As usual, I was looking up at the stars. It was a clear, black night and there were many bright stars in the sky.  I saw what appeared to be a star moving slowly, seemingly between the stars.  When it caught my eye, I watched it for a few seconds, and then told my girlfriend to look at it. After some difficulty in pointing it out to her, she saw it too.  By that time it “curled” slightly to the “right”, and then disappeared.  During the time I knew she was watching it, I asked her “Can you see it? Are you watching it? She said “yes”. Then I said “look, it disappeared!”  I was surprised that it caught my eye because it was very subtle, and my eyesight is bad. I looked like a star—i.e., a white dot. Instead of being in, what I would call the atmosphere of Earth, this object was in the heavens it was among the stars. I kept looking for its continuation, but nothing more was observed.  Incidentally, what also surprises me is that my Girlfriend was very unimpressed by this sighting, telling no one else.  Had she not seen it too, I would have doubted that I’d seen it.;34.2641;-117.1996
