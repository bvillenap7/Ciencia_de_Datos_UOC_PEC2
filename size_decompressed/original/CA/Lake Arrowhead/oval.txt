large oval shaped object surrounded by lights seen over San Bernardino mountain ridge;2005-06-25 03:00:00;3 minutes;large oval shaped object surrounded by lights seen over San Bernardino mountain ridge We live at almost 6 thousand feet in the mountains.  Object seen slowly traveling west to east over ridge of mountain (approx 5 miles from my vantage point) , turned south (slightly changing shape becoming quite thin) and appeared to descend very slowly behind mountain ridge or it could have been just traveling further away in a southerly direction, which from my vantage point would appear to be descending.  It appeared large (size of a quarter) depending upon how far away it was  (although no other craft seen, at other times aircraft in the vicinity would appear much smaller)  craft was lit all around the outside edges with with about 5 smaller lights at the top and about 4-5 very large lights around the bottom, and dim, small lights around the sides.  There was no noise at all.;34.2641;-117.1996
