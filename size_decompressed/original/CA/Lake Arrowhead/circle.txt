We wanted to get away from Los Angeles, the school system, and the rat-race. We were living in a Lake side Home, at the time of this incident.  I, being a night-owl, had a habit of watching late night TV. It was a cold winter, clear night, after a rather large snow fall. Our Lake-side Chalet type home had large windows, overlooking the Lake--a great view.  As usual, I was alone, on the upper level, watching TV, hoping to become sleepy. The rest of the family were downstairs, in bed.                              During a commercial, I looked out the window, onto the deck, and saw 3 bright, round objects over the Lake. They looked like 3 full moons, in a row. The first one was large, middle one, was smaller, and the 3rd one, was the smallest--like the 3 Bears. They were moving along at a steady pace, over the Lake--white in color, very solid--very self contained. no light radiating outside their perimeters. There was no sound.  I wanted to call my husband, but knew that by the time I went downstairs, and awakened him, they would have disappeared around the curve of the Lake-which is the course they were headed.                          I am very much skeptical of UFO sightings--so I thought maybe they were weather balloons, or, ect. I never heard of anyone else that saw them, so I still don't know what they were. I have heard of other sightings in the Lk Arrowhead, Big Bear area. My husband is more of a UFO buff than I, having had a sighting when he was an Airforce Pilot. He was a little disappointed that he hadn't been awake to see what I tried to describe. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Moving, flying,orb-like,;2012-11-13 02:30:00;18 seconds;moving, flying, orb-like, It was a clear sunny afternoon Driving in lake arrowhead, my girlfriend and I pulled off to sit on these steps that overlooked the lake.  There was some interesting metal work I was curious about and when walking down the steps looked up and saw what appeared to be a floating ball bearing about a mile in elevation and 2-3 miles away, this orb like craft moved on an upward scale at a steady pace reflecting the sun and clouds above it very clearly,  when I turned to tell my girlfriend the craft was gone about a half second of looking away.   I scoured the sky for the better part of our time at the steps and saw no more signs of the craft.  I am a believer and this was no weather baloon...;34.2641;-117.1996
