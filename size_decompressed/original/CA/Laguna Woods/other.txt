HUGE bright red lights left & right w/smaller very bright white lights backing them w/bright white central light, horiz. shape.;2014-05-26 21:05:00;~20 seconds;HUGE bright red lights left & right w/smaller very bright white lights backing them w/bright white central light, horiz. shape. Crystal clear sky, according to my Droid compass from the 92637 Zip code location in Laguna Woods, CA, the object appeared at approx. 166-degrees south of my vantage observation point. It had HUGE bright red lights on each end (left & right), with smaller very bright white lights backing them and another white light in the center, all in a straight horizontal fashion left to right. At first it appeared as if an air plane, but the lights were WAY brighter than aircraft lights and an airplane would have had a red light on its port side and a green light on its starboard side.  But, there were no green lights and these lights were WAY larger and MUCH brighter than air craft lights. I have never seen lights this bright in the sky and I worked much of my career at LAX in the AOA (Arport Opertions Area, where the planes and runways are).  So, I know what air planes look like and how they act in the sky. I waited expecting it to move like an airplane, but it held its position perfectly still, then slowly began to move to the Northeast.  Then, not as if traveling at a high rate of speed, but rather it just disappeared as if someone turned out the lights. It was several times larger than air planes observed in the same location.;33.61;-117.7253
