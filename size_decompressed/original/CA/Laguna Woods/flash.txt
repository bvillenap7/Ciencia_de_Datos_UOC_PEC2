Silver Ball Flashes Bright Gold  with military aircraft orbiting;2005-07-04 17:50:00;30 minutes;Silver Ball Flashes Bright Gold  with military aircraft orbiting Family together for 4th of July.  Skies: Clear blue with little or no haze/smog.  Three of the witnesses had no alchol the entire day.  At about 17:35 we begin to hear military jets begin to orbit the city about once every five minutes.  After we here this occur three time we go out to see whats going on.  We see two F/A-18 in an orbiting pattern over to the east of our location.  Aircraft were in a lag formation with wing 1/2 mile back with an altitude of about 4000 Ft and an orbit radius of about 5 miles.  I look to the center of there orbit and spotted a glowing silver ball.  I pointed this out to relatives and three others witnessed this.  I would estimate it's altitude at 6000-8000 ft.  The ball would flash a golden color every 30 seconds or so in a seemingly regular pattern.  This went on until about 18:30 pm, the location of the ball did not change the entire time.  Two of us witnessed white streaks appear within proximity to the ball, and a haze happened to appear arround the location of the ball.  The F/A-18s continued to orbit until we lost sight of the ball.  We didn't really start to think seriously about what the ball could be until about 18:15, and took one film photo that may contain a picture of the aircraft and ball.  I checked 4th of July celebrations for Mission Viejo and Lake Forest but found no evidence of military fly-bys for any of the festivities.  I think we were not the only ones to spot this, so we checked with local CBS affiliates to see if there had been any reports of objects in the sky and military airpower present and were told nothing was reported.;33.61;-117.7253
