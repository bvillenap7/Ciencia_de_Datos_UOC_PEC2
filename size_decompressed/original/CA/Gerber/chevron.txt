About 2:00 high and to the south, I saw a cluster of lights.  I could see red and yellowish lights.  The object was stationary.  I wondered if I was seeing a space station or satellite, but it wasn't moving.   So I went in and called my husband to see if he saw the same thing, I told him to look up to the south.  He described the same thing I saw.  So I wanted more confirmation and called my neighbors down the street.  I asked them to both go outside and look to the south and let me know if they saw anything.  They both described the same object and that it was stationary.  I just went out and it is still there.;40.0408;-122.1607
