My brother notified me that something strange was in the sky and we quickly made our way to the outside porch. A brightly-lit blue saucer was moving up and down, in-circles, and every which way, at an incredible speed. It very quickly moved up into the atmosphere and down into the neighborhoods of Redondo Beach and Palos Verdes Estates. It finally disappeared into a wooded area less than 100 yards from the ocean, near Haggerty's church. ((NUFORC Note:  The object might have been the radio-controlled model airplane, with lights installed, which has been reported frequently in this area.  PD));33.7671;-118.3814
