Powerful light with odd-shaped trails pierced the clouds  ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD));2002-10-14 19:00:00;3 minutes;Powerful light with odd-shaped trails pierced the clouds Please don't contact me - probably not a UFO as I don't believe in them, and did not see a craft - but a weird occurence nonetheless.  Saw a very powerful, wide, white light 40 minutes past sunset that must have been playing some unusual tricks with the clouds.  It was dark, and very cloudy (marine layer).   The light was bright as a star, but about 5-10 times bigger to my eye - a bit bigger than a golf ball, but much smaller than the moon. There was an odd shaping of lit clouds or some sort of light trail forming fast off both sides, starting narrow at the ball, and getting wider as it went out, but changing shape rapidly.   I pulled my car over, saw what looked to be what I call a God effect, with light piercing through a tunnel hole in the clouds, creating sort of a corona on the sides.  I thought it might be the sun going through an unusual hole in the clouds, but it happened at 7:00, well after sunset.  The cloud trails reminded me of missile testing i've seen before, but the sky was too cloudy.  I never thought helicopter because I didn't hear anything - so it's a mystery.  I then continued to see bright light lighting above the clouds in one patch until I got to my house three minutes later.  Then it faded.  I kept checking every 5 minutes or so, but did not see anythiong.  Then, 20 minutes later, I went back outside with my son, who asked what the blue light was above the clouds, which were turning the otherwise gray   marine clouds blue in a small area, which was the same direction I was observing the earlier white light.   (to the West - over the ocean ?)  I told him I didn't know, but 5 minutes later it faded for good.    End of story - do not return e-mail or contact me please. ((Vandenberg rocket launch.
