UFO momentaily flies 50 to 60 feet above street, seemingly out of control, then flies off.;1977-06-15 21:00:00;3 seconds;UFO momentaily flies 50 to 60 feet above street, seemingly out of control, then flies off. In the summer of 1977, I was living in Auburn, California. My wife-to-be (let’s call her Jan) and myself were out taking an evening walk by Lincoln High School (on Lincoln Way).  We both sighted a UFO within 150 feet of our position.  These are the details.  Environmental conditions: The evening was clear with very few, if any clouds.  The sun had set about 15 minutes previously.  Only the brightest stars were beginning to show.  There was no wind that I can recall it was very still.  The story: Jan and I walked by the high school and noticed that it had a fountain in the center of the group of buildings which were in a U shape, open to the street.  We went to the fountain and were looking into it.  I was saying something to Jan and she interrupted me by simultaneously nudging me in the ribs with her elbow and saying look at this.  I looked up and saw a large white triangular shape shoot over the roof of the west wing of the building traveling at a slightly upward angle (the ship was travelling southeast, almost parallel to Lincoln Way).  Almost immediately the ship nosed downward at about a 20 degree angle and looked like it was going to dive into the street.  As it passed the corner of the High School’s west wing, a very large spark shot out of the back and almost immediately dissipated, the way plasma dissipates.  The ship left a light (perhaps even slightly bright) well-defined vaporous trail as it moved through the air which dissipated almost immediately as it came out the back.  At it’s lowest point I estimate that the craft was flying about 40 to 50 feet above street.  As the ship continued to move on its path, I could see the back side of it. There was a diamond-shaped opening from where the vapor trail was coming and it was brilliant.  A moment later and the ship dissappeared behind a large tree. With the sky dark enough to see a few stars, I knew that I would be able to see anything bright.  I ran quickly to a place where I could get an unobstructed view of the horizon or at least as unobstructed as I could manage, and I still saw nothing moving in the sky. The ship had vanished.  See diagrams below.  Final details. ·The fly-by of the ship took about 2 to 3 seconds. ·The ship was white but not glowing. ·It flew in a wobbley manner as if it was almost out of control ·This craft was TOTALLY silent. ·I was vaguely aware of seeing small details on the hull my impression was that it was like the lines formed by plates fitting together on the fuselage of an aircraft but I could be wrong on that description. I was not focussed on such small details at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
Black craft 600 ft above home, seen by two girls in suburban Auburn.;2009-09-12 11:46:00;30 seconds;Black craft 600 ft above home, seen by two girls in suburban Auburn. My friend and I were outside in my backyard eating cake while we watched a thunderstorm progress above. I looked up and I saw what I believed at the time to be a stealth aircraft. But something didn't look right so I asked my friend what the object was.  She is more tech savvy than myself however, she too was mystefied.  The craft was triangular with two bumps towards the bottom of the triangle. It was pitch black in color like someone had spray painted it.  The strange thing was, it was moving backwards so that the bumps were in the front.  It was moving somewhat slow for an airplane.It was very low as well, about 600 ft above my house.  Four suns in comparison could make up the craft.  I called my mother out when it was about half gone, when she arrived she could only see the outline. About 30 seconds after it had appeared it went behind the clowds.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
A large, black triangle ship flying low at mid-day with no sound;2009-09-17 11:50:00;5 min;A large, black triangle ship flying low at mid-day with no sound It was mid-day, just before noon.  My daughter and her friend called for me from the backyard and I got there just in time to see a very large, very black triangular shape ship flying away.  It was perhaps 1000 ft above our house, flying well below the low cloud cover. The craft spanned about 75 feet wide. It was flying at a slow, and even pace.  It simply flew over our neighborhood and off into the distance.  There was absolutely NO sound.  The black color was an unusual matte, no shine whatsoever. The triangle shape seemed to be flying backwards.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
Triangle with white  lights on the sand fire in  northern CA.;2014-07-25 21:40:00;5 minutes;Triangle with white  lights on the sand fire in  northern ca My wife and I were watching the glow of flames from the sand fire.  We live at 1300 feet in South Auburn.  While watching the glow from the fire, we witnessed a Constellation in the form of a triangle, hovering just to the north of the main fire.   After observing it for a short period of time, the lights one by one disappeared. We checked the sky 2 nights in at the same time.  No triangles appeared skies were clear;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
Two (possibly three) extremely bright lights, on huge, low-flying, object. Lights brightened and dimmed, object suddenly disappeared.;2016-07-25 22:30:00;2 minutes;Two (possibly three) extremely bright lights, on huge, low-flying, object. Lights brightened and dimmed, object suddenly disappeared. UFO at 10:30 pm – We live in flight path of commercial aircraft landing at Sacramento Airport.  We see many flights landing nightly while sitting in our hot tub.  Commercial jets move east to west and make a lot of noise.  We rarely see anything moving north to south, (only small aircraft).  This was not a small aircraft, as it was huge, low-flying and completely silent.  This object/or objects  and was many times larger than a commercial aircraft, and it was flying much lower. The object appeared suddenly, as 2 huge bright lights which appeared to be connected by a solid surface. The lights moved in exact unison, with zero noise. There was possibly a third light that was dimmed at the time of the sighting, which would indicate that it could have been a triangle with 3rd light dimmed. Behavior of craft:  One light became extremely bright, (brighter than landing lights on aircraft).  The second light alternated from medium-bright to dim for a few seconds.  Next, the brightest light dimmed and for an instant it seemed as though a third light appeared and then dimmed. The object was huge.  We watched it move, north to south for about 2 minutes, and then it completely disappeared while we were watching it.  It went from visible to invisible.  Poof! … gone!;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
