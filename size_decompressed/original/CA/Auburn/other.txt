What happened to me on July 26, 2013 was unbelievable.   This is a no B.S. report.  I cannot explain what has been put on my right arm but maybe you can.  I will try and attach photos to prove what I am talking about. To get to the heart of the matter, I was sleeping that night and thought I was having a dream, but was not.  I went to a ship or planet and was put on a table without legs and there was a bright lights above the table and darkness all around.  Was escorted by 6 (what looked like people) about 4 feet tall dressed in long white robes.  I did notice that their heads were larger as far as our proportional body.  I was put on this TABLE and a device what appeared to be a scanner of some sort, scanned me for at least 15 minutes, my best guess.  The individuals never tried to inflict pain or hurt me.  It was as they were collecting data for our future.  The scan went over my body at least 5 times.  Never felt any pain, as a matter of fact, I felt content.  It's like I was branded with something embedded.   I woke up on July 27, 2013 at 4:30 AM to take my Mother to the airport.  Was in a hurry as usual, took her to the Sacramento, CA, airport.  Went back home and went to sleep. Woke ! up did my daily duties, watched some TV and was in the bathroom and noticed the below pics.  Didn't know what to think at first, but there was no pain as to the marks on me.  I wonder how long they will last no my right arm ????  Anyway, I also must tell you that for the last 2 + years I have been having I guess or contacts about the next generation computers. Anyway take a look at the pics.  If you look close you will see 2 red pinholes in the lower part of the larger branding. I don't know why you don't want my email by I am going to pursue the next generation computers.  Did send you the pics from the link below via email. ufocntr@nwlink.com   Sincerely, ((initials deleted))   PhD. (SAT)   PS:  Guess I can't paste the pics in this, so what good is it to spend so much time to give you the info and I am anonymous ???? ((NUFORC Note:  Photos forwarded, and they indicate two burn-like marks on the witness's upper right arm.  We cannot certify that they are anything but burn marks.

Two sets of long string of lights;2021-02-17 05:25:00;5 minutes;Two sets of long string of lights High in the Eastern sky over the Sierra Foothills I observed as I can best describe this as a two long but separate straight string of lights.  Like a.  Long passenger train might look like at night with all the light showing through open windows. I watch as the first one moved I  a north to south direction  with a 30 degrees down angle. It took 2 to 3 minutes to make its way out of view but as it did the 2nd one which was identical to the first came into view following the same path and same duration .;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
