Sun behind high clouds, grey/yellow in color, and bright. Saw other bright area approx. 50 degrees to the south. not as bright as sun, but for moment I thought it was the sun. Clouds lighted in this area same as sun.  Watched for several minutes, then clouds appeared to open, and small round objt. came down through the clouds. This was at great distance, objt small. bit def. round and very brights as if reflec. sunlight.  Lost sight of objt. after sev. mins. It traveled south and east. I was driving to work (Deputy Sheriff) west bound on interstate 80 between Auburn and Loomis, Ca.  I drive this route many times a week both while working and off duty.  On this date, (not sure of exact date) I was momentarily confused by the location of the sun.  I observed it as I came over a hill and began a slow curve to the west.  I believed it should have been more to the north, and as I came out of the curve I realized it was.  The other bright area was to the south of the sun. The sun was behind a high band of cloud, the sky otherwise clear pale blue in color as is normal here this time of year in afternoon. I looked from the sun to the other bright area.  I have never seen this before.  I appeared as if the sun were being reflected off something.  As I watched, the clouds appeared to part in a circular pattern which also seemed curious as I had not seen that before either...I do watch the skys. After about four minutes I noted a very bright object come below the clouds and travel slowly to the south. This appeared to be very far away.  The object was very bright as if the sun were reflecting off of it.  My first thought was aircraft, but it did not appear to have wings and was moving very slowly. At work, about two minutes later, I pointed the bright area out to a co-worker, but from our location the sun was below the trees and only the other bright area could be seen.  It was quickly fading as we watched.  The object was also gone.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
Large and orange amber colored sphere hovering in the sky over Auburn, CA;2011-12-27 19:15:00;1 minute;Large and orange amber colored sphere hovering in the sky over Auburn, CA I was going home from the gym, I stopped at the stop light before turning right.  I noticed beyond the stop light up in the sky a very large orange amber colored glowing sphere that just hovered and didn't move.  I found it odd that it didn't move and pulled over to the side of the road after making my turn.  I got out of my car to look at it and then noticed it was moving very slowly and then made a 90 degree turn away from me going North.  As it moved away it seemed to dim out like a flashlight on low batteries and then disappear into the night.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
Two large orange colored lights over the Auburn skies at night;2011-12-31 19:10:00;10 seconds;Two large orange colored lights over the Auburn skies at night I was leaving my house to go visit some friends for a New Years party.  As I pulled my car up to the stop sign at the top of my hill, I glanced out towards the Sacramento Valley.  Off in the distance, I saw two large orange amber lights that looked about 5 miles away.  So I rolled down my window to get a better look at them because I never have seen anything like them before.  At the same time looking at them I was desparately trying to get my camera out of my bag to take a picture of these two lights.  These lights were exactly the same color and size and both moved in unison and speed.  One did not move faster or slower than the other.  As I watched them they both made a sharp turn at the exact same time and the lights flickered out.  I never got my picture of them before they disappered.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
Auburn, CA, looking due west, 2 red orbs came together, then flew off at high speed, no sound.;2015-11-21 18:27:00;2 minutes;Auburn, CA, looking due west, 2 red orbs came together, then flew off at high speed, no sound. Saturday, 11/21/15, 18:27 was the date and time on the sales slip as I walked out of the Dollar Store in North Auburn along Highway 49 at the address of:  2136 Grass Valley Hwy, Auburn, CA 95603, having just paid for my goods and walking due west into the parking lot to my car. I immediately noticed two very strange bright red lights that were far in the distance and very high up, the kind of altitude you would expect to see a high flying jet, or even higher.  It just seemed high up and distant. They were roundish and brilliant red, no other colors.  It did not look like airplane lights since no other colors appeared, just extremely pure brilliant red. One seemed to be heading upward and getting closer and the other appeared to be heading downward and getting closer, coming toward my direction in other words and they had a roundish appearance to them. I did not think to take out my cell phone and try taking photos, they might not come out since it's not really a good camera for in the dark anyhow. As I watched, soon the lights came near to one another, maybe touched, but I could not know for sure.  Then one shot outwards to the left and going higher and disappeared out of sight, in the matter of a few seconds. Then the other shot up and outward, at an angle heading exactly back in the opposite direction while going up - and it seemed to accelerate as it got smaller and smaller, then disappeared in a few seconds also, like it had traveled out of sight in a very short time. There was no noises from these lights, but I doubted there would be given how far away and high they appeared.  The only noises were sounds in the parking lot and long the main road of cars driving by or peoples' voices in the background going in and out of the stores. That is all I know and can report on what I saw tonight here in North Auburn, CA, 95603. I am 61 years old, male, non-drinker, non-smoker, non-drug user, of clear mind and body, do not suffer from haulucinations or anything of the sort.  So I am certain I saw what I saw with my own two eyes and have reported what I saw as accurately as I can remember. It is now 1 hour and 20 minutes after seeing what I saw.  So my memory is still very fresh and clear too.  The event lasted about 1 to 2 minutes, no longer.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
