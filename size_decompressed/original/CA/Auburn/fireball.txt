They were just below the constellation Caseopia. They traveled on a slight angle toward Earth. My first thought was that I was seeing space debris entering the atmosphere. But then I realized that they appeared to be in a formation similar to that of flying birds.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889

One of the objects trailed off behind, while the other 6-7 continued beyond the horizon toward the east. They appeared to be a cluster of comets, that travled at exactly the same rate of speed. Their sizes varied (sm-lg) but all of them had tails behind them. They did not fall, like a meteor,or falling star, they instead were traveling apparently powered by some source. In other words, they did not loose speed as they traveled, but continued in their astonishing fast and silent flight. When I called information looking for your telephone number, I was told by the operator that several people had called in already from Redding, CA. I wish there was more to tell. Thank you for your work in this field.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
