One trailed behind,  then took off to catch up with the others.  We never heard a sound.  My husband saw them as he lay on the couch by the window.  He yelled at me to come and we ran outside to watch them.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
continuous formation of white lights;2021-05-28 21:12:00;10 seconds;continuous formation of white lights I was walking in my front yard using a flashlight. I looked up and saw what looked like an illuminated telephone wire. At first I thought my flashlight was lighting up a telephone wire. I turned off the light and saw a continuous line of white lights traveling at high speed, one after another in trail spacing that left a light tail. The formation was moving from my left to right in a SE direction at a very high speed. I followed the formation until it disappeared over the horizon. I heard no aircraft noise following the formation nor did I see a contrail. The image simple vanished over the horizon.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
