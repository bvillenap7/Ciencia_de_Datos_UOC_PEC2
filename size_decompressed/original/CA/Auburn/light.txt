2 lights traveling in formation then fading away into space.;2006-02-15 19:10:00;45 seconds;2 lights traveling in formation then fading away into space. While looking at the big dipper on an extremely clear night I noticed a very bright star near the bottom or east of the big dipper.  It seemed to be traveling away from my vantage point at a very high altitude.  I then noticed a second star like object traveling near the first one but not as bright.  I tried to figure out what I was looking at,they were not conventional aircraft or satelites.  As I stared at these 2 objects they began to fade completely out of sight as if they were leaving the atmosphere.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
Unusual lights over Auburn, Ca.;2012-07-19 21:50:00;About 1 minute;Unusual lights over Auburn, Ca. Looking east at the sky just before 10 pm, I saw two lights that looked like stars.  I watched them for a little over half a minute thinking that the two stars were too close together and did not belong there.  Suddenly they began to circle each other (almost like two dogs chasing each other in a circle) and when they had completed two circles, they shot off across the sky each in the opposite direction of the other.  They did not gain or lose brightness as they shot across the sky.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
