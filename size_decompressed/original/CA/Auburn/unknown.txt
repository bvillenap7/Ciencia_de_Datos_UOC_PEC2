This happened so long ago....I was about 9 years old and I was lying on the deck in the front of my house (in Lake of the Pines outside of Auburn CA) with my friend.  We were looking at shooting stars and all of a sudden the craft flew over our heads and hovered.  It then took off extremely fast out of our vision.  Then it came back and hovered again over our heads and took off in the other direction, again, out of our vision.  I believe it came back one more time, hovered for what seemed like maybe five minutes and took off again.  After being frozen with fear we ran into the house.  We never reported this to anyone.  I would say that it all happened within 10-20 minutes.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
Lighted object flying fast and low overhead with no sound.;2013-10-22 21:00:00;<1 minute;Lighted object flying fast and low overhead with no sound I was standing on the balcony of my apartment and happened to look up and see a lighted object shooting across the sky, but flying fairly low as if a small plane.  I thought it was a meteor, but it did not “burn up and disappear” but just kept going very fast and low towards the west until it disappeared behind trees in the distance.  Also there was a blue tint to the lights. I can’t describe the object in detail at all because I didn’t have on my glasses and lights at night appear to me stared and blurry in the distance.  So I wasn’t able to discern an exact shape. It couldn’t have been a plane as there was no sound at all, either before, during or after.  The blue tint to the lights seems to rule out a meteor.  I have no idea if there is any aircraft that flies so fast and soundless in the US.  But I felt I should report this.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
