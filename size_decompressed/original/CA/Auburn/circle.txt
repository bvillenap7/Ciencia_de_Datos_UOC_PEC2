Direction of flight: 60 degrees, from south to north.  Two-second flight. This appeared more a celestial body than a vehicle or craft.  It entered at 60 degrees, north from south, one-quarter up from the horizon.  It was a fiery, golden globe, not as large as a full moon.  It had no tail.  As it reached what I would have assumed to have been impact (given the hilly terrain beyond the trees), there was the suggestion of flaring. I imagined that if it had indeed reached Earth, it would have set vegetation on fire or broken through a roof.  There were no such reports in the area.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889

The craft had a yellow and red light that hurt my eyes if i stared at it for long.I felt a rumble in my chest like a bass at a concert.When it moved it almost teleported like it was liquid.

Bright circular lights flying threw the air in Auburn,Ca.  MILITARY KNOWS. LOOK.;2011-08-14 09:30:00;1 minute;Bright circular lights flying threw the air in Auburn,Ca. MILITARY KNOWS. LOOK. Hello. On 8/14/11 is the first time i saw these circular UFO's.  The first time it was a bright circular light flying at a lower altitude.  At first i thought it was an airplane but then i saw it pass over and there was still a solid light flying away.  What airplane has lights around the whole airplane? none.  And the object was completely quiete, no sound what so ever.  But it Didn't stop there.  The next day there were what looked to be military aircraft about 5-8 of them circling around the area of were I saw the object for hours.  I'd say they had a 5 mile radius if not more of just circling looking for this thing.  Then I saw the object again.  Sure enough 2 of the military aircraft's started following it flying above it then after about 2 minutes it diapered.  Then the day after they are back again. I looked out my window and saw at least 9 maybe 10 aircraft's flying in the air.  I believe there was only one UFO and the others were military because one of the ligh! ts was much brighter then the others.  The were dog fighting flying through the air for AT LEAST 1 and a half if not 2 hours.  I would see them circling the object then regrouping in formation and fly towards it again.  But after 30 minutes i stopped watching so I didn't see if the military shot it out of the sky or not. All the object I saw were circular BRIGHT lights.  Not satilights I know what those look like. Please look into this. Lots of wierd objects flying around here. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889

Sighted in Auburn, Ca. 7:58pm, a round sphere, egg shaped but very large object illuminated at night, went over our heads in the night sky, moving west toward sacramento and moving not as fast as an airplane, but slower.  Went over our head and continued west..no sound but lit as if illuminated by light.  Absolutely silent.  No wind that night and definitely not fireworks. we don't drink..this was definitely not something we have ever seen before. It changed course slightly after flying over our heads..was moving forward..  Absolutely no wind ..clear perfect weather.;38.9284166666667;-121.085513888889
