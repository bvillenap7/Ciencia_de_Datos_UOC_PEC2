Small cylinder flying across the sky during the blood moon lunar eclipse.;2014-04-15 00:00:00;8 seconds;Small cylinder flying across the sky during the blood moon lunar eclipse I was standing on my front lawn (facing south) watching the lunar eclipse (blood moon) at 11:55 p.m. on 04/14/14.  I believe the moon had just been fully eclipsed only a minute or so when I noticed a strange moving object in the sky. The first thought I had was, “why is that plane flying with out any lights on?”  Then, I immediately noticed it wasn’t a plane. It looked to me like a cylinder perhaps 30 feet in length and maybe 8 feet in diameter.  This dimensional estimate is based on a guess I have made after reflecting on what altitude I believed the object to be flying at. It appeared to me to be flying at the cloud level which I estimated to be perhaps 5000 feet higher than the private planes I observed flying over the city in the southern sky. Those planes were at a typical 5000 foot level.  So I am estimating the objects altitude at between 8000 and 10000 feet.  The city lights are the only thing that illuminated the object. In the dim illumination the surface of the object looked off white in color.  It was flying in a direction perpendicular to the length of the cylinder shape. I also noticed that it was traveling at a rate of speed many times faster than any man made aircraft can fly.  It was traveling in a North West direction, approximately 3 degrees lower than the angle of the moon in the sky. It disappeared from view within about 8 seconds. I looked around my neighborhood to see if anyone else was outside watching the eclipse, and there was no one for me to inquire with as to if they had seen the same object as I.;34.1270080103358;-117.855028165375
