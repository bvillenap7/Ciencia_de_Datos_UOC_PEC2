After hovering for five min's, the object moves Eastward. On the night of Tuesday, January 28th, 1973, A double tiered Windowed Saucer shaped craft is observed from my bedroom window. It was first seen rising above the rooftop of the neighboring houses to the South. I dashed to the window for a better view, because I never saw anything like this before, and I never saw anything like it since. As the craft hovered over my back patio I took note of the windows  being a Bright yellow to an amber. Some were an Iced Tea color. The dome atop of the saucer, which was the first thing I noticed, was a dull pale white.  Two illuminated shafts of light accompanied the dome. The bottom side of the craft was completely dark with the exception of two lights (bluish-white in color) that went around in a circle. (Clockwise from my point of view.) Then after hovering for about five minutes, the craft begins to move towards the East, flying along at its low altitude of roughly a hundred feet give or take, then vanishes from view.;34.1270080103358;-117.855028165375
Saucer in the San Gabriel Valley;2001-10-31 20:00:00;unsure;Saucer in the San Gabriel Valley I recently found this site and decided to post my sighting.  This was a very long time ago, and I was rather young, so the details are somewhat hazy.   I remember seeing the craft while out trick-or-treating with some of my friends. We stopped at my friend's house down the street and we were standing in his front yard talking, when one of my friends said What is that? and pointed to the north/northwest.   We looked at it for a little bit, and lost interest (being kids, and all).  I felt very awkward about the whole situation, and I never really spoke about it until years later.   My friends and I never spoke of it again, and I have not asked them about it.   It felt so surreal that I almost immediately assummed I was seeing things, or that someone was playing a prank on me. But when I look back on it, it is very hazy yet very real, and I cannot explain a lot of the night after the sighting.  If anyone knows what this was, I would love to know.;34.1270080103358;-117.855028165375

We looked at it for a little bit, and lost interest (being kids, and all). I remember the object being very distinct, and I remember that it was floating stationary.   It had a metallic look to it, and there was no noise whatsoever.   I felt very awkward about the whole situation, and I never really spoke about it until years later.

Silver Disk above Glendora, Ca.;2009-08-05 11:30:00;6 or 8 min;Silver Disk above Glendora, Ca. I was driving north on the 57 Fwy I had just passed Pomona, I was heading towards the 210 fwy and looked up at the mountains above Glendora, Ca. and saw 1 disk shaped UFO, silver in color it looked to me to have been at least 100 or so ft above the Mountains, it was at least seventy ft in circumference.  It moved slowly over the Mountains for about 6 to 8 min and vanished in front of me.  I know every one on the 57 freeway going that way must have seen it.  It was to big to have been a balloon and it was definitely not a plane or helicopter.   On a personal note, in 2004 I was working near La Vern Ca. and was looking up towards a person repairing a roof, and saw 2 silver disk way above La Vern moving very slowly, I pointed them out to the roofer, and we watched them for about 30 min and then they disappeared all very strange..;34.1270080103358;-117.855028165375
