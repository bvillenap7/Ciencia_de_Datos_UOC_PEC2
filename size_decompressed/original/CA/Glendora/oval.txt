Flew aw I left my home here in Glendora on July 30, 2003 and was heading South on Grand Avenue shortly before 1pm in the afternoon. Shortly before I reached the interection with Foothill Boulevard, I saw through my windshield to my left a silvery, oval-shaped object tilted in midair and hovering. It was tilted from left to right and had a series of rings on the object with a dome-like structure on top. Suddenly, it kind of pitched and shot off to the west and was gone!  The whole episode seemed to last no more than 2-3 seconds.;34.1270080103358;-117.855028165375
