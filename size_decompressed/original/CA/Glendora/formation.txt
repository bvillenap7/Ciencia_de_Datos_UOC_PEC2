Extremely fast two shipper lights over greater Los Angeles.;2019-05-03 21:20:00;4 seconds;Extremely fast two shipper lights over greater Los Angeles. At approximately 2115 pst local, I witnessed two (2) dully lit objects, in formation, flying from behind me on a north/NW course at a remarkable speed. I observed the craft from under a patio until they nearly cleared the roofline of the house due north of me  (approximately 40 ft).  They commenced a perfectly coordinated port turn, effectively at 90-100 degrees due west (compensating for 5 degrees flux in this AO).   I quickly lost visual observation of these craft, and quickly alerted another person in the household, dousing all interior and exterior lights. There was no sound. There were no navigation or anti-smack lights on either craft. There was no audible noise or especially boom, given the approximated EXTREMELY high rate of speed. There was no afterburner visible or audible.  From orientation of seated, facing southwest,  The lights appeared at the left hand side of Cancer and disappeared around Mars/Delphod. I have a decade + of aerospace training, mfg and operations (.mil & civilian) - this was something Iâ€™ve never experienced before.  The course corrections, motivation/power source and speed are beyond explanation.;34.1270080103358;-117.855028165375
