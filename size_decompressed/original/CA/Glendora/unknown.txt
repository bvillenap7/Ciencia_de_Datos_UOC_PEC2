Visibility was about 20 feet. While sitting on my car hood on a known turn out with at least a 100 foot drop off past the guard rail, we realized the crickets in the area became very quiet. A few seconds later we were illuminated by a intense light beam. I looked at the light and saw it was mounted on some type of bracket with a dark projection below it resembling a boom microphone. We ran for the drivers door of my car and as we entered the car the light turned off and the fog swirled as if a large oblect left upward. At no time during the encounter did I hear anything. FYI I am now a police officer and don't consider myself a UFO buff or even believer. I am just telling you about something that happened 20 years ago that I can not explain.
