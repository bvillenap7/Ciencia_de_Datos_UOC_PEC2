We were star gazing and I looked up in the sky at about a 45 degree angle and saw a white light, which I thought was just a plane moving west horizontally then the light stopped and changed color to this bright neon green color and dropped vertically for about 5-10 seconds then shot south at light speed.  Within an instant it was gone.;34.1270080103358;-117.855028165375

About 10 min later another one was spotted moving from east to west, same small dot, no sound no flashing, about 10 min later, was one spotted from the south going north, and then another from the east going west.  They were the size of a star, very far out.   We walk these trails all the time and never saw anything like this.   We have an airport - Ontario, and still nothing like this.;34.1270080103358;-117.855028165375
