Silver Sphere over looking California wild fires;2009-09-05 12:10:00;4 min;Silver Sphere over looking California wild fires At 1210 hrs I was in my garage when I was looking down at a puddle of water.  I was looking at the reflection of the sky.  I noticed a silver object and stepped outside the garage and looked in a southeast direction.  I saw a silver sphere and as I was looking at it two other sliver spheres (smaller than the first sphere) came out of it and began to circle around the larger sphere.  The sphere seems to be looking towards the California wild fires (Mt. Wilson). I watched as a fourth smaller sphere came from the larger sphere.  I watch for about three minutes and in a blink of an eye it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
