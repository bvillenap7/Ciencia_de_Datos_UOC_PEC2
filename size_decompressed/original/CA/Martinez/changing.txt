The objects oscillated and seemed to change shape (could be because they were rotating). They also ascended, exhibiting horizontal movements as well. They were NOT twinkling stars! Between approximately 12:00-1:00 a.m., we saw two bright objects in the sky with red and green flashing lights (and a diffuse white light off to one side of the larger of the two objects). We estimate they were about 30 degrees over the horizon (in the East-Northeast part of the sky. (The general location appeared to be over oil refineries in the area). The objects oscillated and seemed to change shape and dim and brighten(could be because they were rotating). They also ascended, exhibiting horizontal movements as well, and moved relative to fixed points. They were too distant for us to determine their exact shape. But we know they were NOT twinkling stars!;37.9845;-122.1355
