Inverted Teardrop-shaped UFO Martinez, CA.;2010-11-18 22:43:00;10 seconds;Inverted Teardrop-shaped UFO Martinez, CA. My wife, an amateur astronomer, who has for years enjoyed meteors and satellites, just walked in from outside (she was looking for more Leonids) and said she saw a UFO.  I quickly wrote down what she saw.  This happened less than 20 minutes ago.  No wind, temp 54 F., cloudy with patches of haze.  My wife saw an object that was an inverted teardrop shape, a dull brick red (possible dull glow), around 1/8th the size of the Moon, no noise, heading northwest in an ARC, at a slow pace, below the cloud cover.  It's her first UFO and she's sketching it, right now.  Sadly, I didn't see it. I sent a text message to George Norry's show, which is on live.;37.9845;-122.1355
