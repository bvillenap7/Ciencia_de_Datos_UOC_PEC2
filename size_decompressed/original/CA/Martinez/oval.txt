Large glowing ovoid descends rapidly west of Martinez, California.;2002-06-29 02:25:00;2 seconds;Large glowing ovoid descends rapidly west of Martinez, California. I was in my home in Martinez and observed this object over the ridge to the West of downtown.  I saw it through an open window (not through the glass).  It came in from the south at 35 degrees from the horizontal.  It traveled down in a straight line.  It disappeared behind the ridge west of town.  It was a glowing yellow in color.  It was roughly ovoid in shape.  It was the size of my little finger nail held at arms length.  I got the impression (which might not be correct) that it was a large object quite a distance away (maybe 5 miles or so).  It traversed roughly 10 degres of the sky before disappearing behind the ridge.  After getting over my initial surprise, I jumped up and went to the window and observed the sky for another half minute, but saw no further activity.  I would be interested in knowing if any other San Francisco Bay Area residents saw this object.

Bubble Shaped Object Spotted in Martinez,CA;2008-09-26 13:52:00;7 mins.;Bubble Shaped Object Spotted in Martinez, CA I was in my backyard in the swimming pool on the afternoon of Sept. 26 '08.  I was staring up at the sky, when over the top of a tree high up in the sky I saw an object emerge.  I watched it closely, trying to identify what it was.  It appeared to be a clearish, lit up bubble looking thing.  Or like a large star. Very hard to describe.  5 more objects emerged & slowly glided accross the sky, still high up, but very visible.  They came over my home & hovered. Then they completely vanished.  The event took place at 1:52 pm, & lasted approximately 7 minutes.  I tried to video the objects from my cell phone, but they are unable to be seen.;37.9845;-122.1355
Red light over Conta Costa County;2009-08-10 23:00:00;1 hour;Red light over Conta Costa County A red orangish light that varied in intensity, was in an oval shape moving in an erratic fashion for over an hour.  It went from south to west, then back to south. It seemed to stay in the same position for about fifteen minutes at a time. It moved in small circular up and down movements, like a tadpole, as it traveled across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
