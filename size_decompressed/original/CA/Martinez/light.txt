Light in sky that constantly dulled and brightened while moving.;2001-01-23 19:50:00;10 minutes;Light in sky that constantly dulled and brightened while moving. Object appeared as a bright yellow/white light.  Extremely bright light, no star could compare to this light.  Object started to dull and fade till it was just a pinhole of light.  Object then came back just as bright.  This fading and reappering continued for about 10 minutes.  Object then would appear bright, completely disappear then come back in a different spot.  Then it would disappear again only to come back in it's original spot.  This continued for about 5 minutes.;37.9845;-122.1355
Seen colorfull, unusual moving star near the earths atmosphere.;2001-08-27 04:45:00;1.5 hrs;Seen colorfull, unusual moving star near the earths atmosphere. It appeared to be a star that looked like the Planet Veines with flashing colored lights. As I was star gazing I noticed this star to move in short quick moves repeatedly stopping and pausing still between each short quick swift move. The pauses lasted about 30 to 45 seconds. This was very unusual to me so I continued to watch it for aprox 1.5 hrs. When making its moves, it would instantaneously changed directions from left to right or up and down moving in straight lines. It also moved in half circles. It gradually worked its way in a northern direction. When I looked at it with binoculars, it was mostly fuzzy and blurred from the bright colors. After focusing the long-range binoculars the best I could, I made out a few physical characteristics. The illuminated rainbow colored panels making up the diameter of the object and most of the height. The colors slowing rotated around the object. This was not a star, with out a dought, this was a solid mass object near the atmosphere. I'm assuming it was just outside the earth's atmosphere. The colored lights which appeared to be panels where just bright enough to blur out the rest of the shape. The position and placement of the colored panels made up the horizontally sliced cone shape that I could best make out. Were there any other reports on this ???? please reply..... Im must get some conformation about it before I'll tell to many people.  I&#8217m having trouble getting anyone to return my calls. (UFO agency's, air ports haven't called back) WAS THIS A SATILITE????????? Please reply ((NUFORC Note:  Same witness as for preceding report.  The description is consistent with what a person staring at a twinkling star will report.  PD));37.9845;-122.1355

3 lighted circular air craft dropped straight down out of my view into the hills.;2008-10-09 22:30:00;5 minutes;3 lighted circular air craft dropped straight down out of my view into the hills. I was driving along highway 4 towards the city of Rodeo.  I noticed what I thought was a plane flying lower than the other two planes I had seen in the sky and it was also moving at a slower speed.  After watching for about a minute it dropped straight down out of my view into the hills.  It had a red, blue and an amber colored light and was in a triangle/circular pattern.  It dropped at such a fast speed the lights left a trail for a second.  I expected to see a possible explosion or smoke from a crash because I have never seen something drop at that rate of speed from the sky.  Once the object went out of site I did not see it again.  Thanks;37.9845;-122.1355
Bright Red Light Hovering in the sky;2009-06-16 22:30:00;25 minutes;Bright Red Light Hovering in the sky Driving south on I-680 in the East Bay in the San Francisco bay area to work on Monday night 6/16/09.  Saw a bright red light in the sky.  It was as bright as a stop light and was not pulsating or blinking.  Thought it was an aircraft or a helicopter , but it did not have any additional lights blinking as an air plane would have.  The light appeared to be higher than an aircraft would be flying in the area.   The light hovered in the sky and was not moving for several minutes.  The light proceeded to move from west to east gaining altitude but remained bright.  Still driving, watched as it moved away towards the east, but it stopped again and was not moving.  Watched for 10 more minutes and realized it was moving again, this time in a southerly direction.  It appeared to be moving further away in a southerly direction, suddenly I realized it moved back towards the west and back closer to where it was before.  It continued to move south and then started gradually moving towards the east again until it was out of sight.  Overall, I observed the object for 20 to 25 minutes.;37.9845;-122.1355
Extremely bright light seen moving and stopping for over an hour;2011-09-18 03:00:00;over an hour;extremely bright light seen moving and stopping for over an hour for the second night in a row, I've seen an extremely bright light moving erratically in the night sky.  The object is at an altitude higher than a commercial airplane and much brighter than any helicopter or airplane, the object emits no noise and moves very slowly. The light moves in waves and stops periodically, the light was in the same vicinity as the night before. The light is brighter than the moon and appears to have some sort of small tail.
