Two objects moving from the western horizon to the east. Both were orange in color and pretty much maintained the same distance from eachother.  A smaller blue object appeared to be moving away from them towards the western horizon. My son and I both observed them, and he went in to get the binoculars to get a better look. We watched for several minutes noting that they were moving across the sky but were a great distance from us. I went to get the video camera, and my son looked back outside, and they were gone.
