2 red lights becoming 3-white lights seen over Martinez,Ca, Marina Park area.;2014-09-11 21:10:00;5-10 minutes;2 red lights becoming 3-white lights seen over Martinez,Ca, Marina park area. Observed in Martinez, Ca., with 2-witnessess, a craft or crafts slowly moving in a NE direction towards another city, Benicia.  Picture a pencil at arm's length with a red light at each end in a straight line away from each other & remove the mental image of the pencil.   The 2-red lights would move closer together to 1-red light & then become 3-white lights & moving in a ball juggling fashion in tight proximity/formation,then back to 1-red light which expanded to 2-red lights & increasing in distance from each other again.  This activity would occur for many miles until the lights separated at a great distance from each other with one stationary & the other moving away at a greater distance.  The stationary light would then rejoin the other red light until out of view.;37.9845;-122.1355
Large bright light hovering and making arc like movements.;2015-04-30 23:20:00;10 minutes;Large bright light hovering and making arc like movements. At approximately 23:20 hours, myself and two friends noticed a large, bright light.  It was the level of the hillside across the road.  About 100 yards high.  It hovered and moved left and right, forward and back. The distance of the movements was  probably a few feet at a time.  These movements happened randomly, and were not rhythmic in any way.  When the movements were executed they seemed circular, they did not move in a straight line from left to right, but made an arc.   The light was round, bright and white.  We could also see a red light that was much smaller and appeared to be behind the white light.  At the beginning of the sighting, the object was about a half mile away from us.   After a couple of minutes of watching it, it moved forward toward us to about 1/4 of a mile away.  Then it moved back to its original distance.  After around 10 minutes it began to move away while keeping the same position in the sky, for the light got smaller and dimmer.  It finally moved beyond the crest of the hill and disappeared.;37.9845;-122.1355
