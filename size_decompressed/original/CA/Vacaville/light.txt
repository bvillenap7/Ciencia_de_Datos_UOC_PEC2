It was bright and orange colored. I am a special education teacher with over 30 years of experience.  I have never seen a UFO, though have friends and family who have.  This event was at 11:45 p.m. Saturday night, May 13th.  I was standing outside enjoying the stillness and the night when I saw a very bright aircraft passing from West to East (over the house)  It was far too bright to be an airplane and the bright orange glow was certainly not typical of any aircraft I have seen in the past.  This beautiful thing was symetrical, large round center with small round shapes surrounding it.  It must have been quite high because it looked like it was traveling at a slow speed and there was no sound.  As it went over the house, I ran through to the front door, snagging my husband at the same time as we both watched it quickly disappear into the eastern sky.;38.3671559322034;-121.972

The object was travaling about 500 miles per hour. I told my friend to stop the car and look and she saw it to. We got out of the car to get a better look and it fized out as it flew through the casiopa constellation.  A bright light just then seemed to cetch my eyes about 75 to 100 feet over our heads as it flew silently fast just above our heads.  I was frightened enough to run and jump back in to the car.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
Moving star like object, fading in and out, and moving different directions.  ((NUFORC Note:  Could not have been the ISS.  PD));2011-06-21 23:00:00;2 mintues;Moving star like object, fading in and out, and moving different directions. For the last few months, me and my father have been watching the night sky over Vacaville, CA, looking for the orange lights/Fireballs that have been largely reported over the last year or so.  I've still never witnessed them myself (my father did while on business in Charleston, SC, last month), but I did see something interesting this night.  On June 21st I began looking up at the sky at roughly 10 pm. A few minutes before 11 PM, (I know it was slightly before 11 because of the TV program on in My garage) as I was looking towards the East above my house, I noticed what appeared to be a quite bright star or satellite, moving from South to North, at a slightly faster speed than the satellites I see often. Naturally, I assumed this was a satellite because it appeared to be so far away and had just one solid light (Looked just like a star), but I just kept watching it anyways, as I wasn't even seeing airplanes this night (Which is pretty odd because I live minutes from the Vacaville private Airport, and only 12 miles from Travis AFB.)   After about 20 seconds, the light began to slowly fade and was about to be blocked from my view by trees in my front yard.  So I moved to the side of my house (which faces South) and continued to watch it move North until it completely faded away.  It took roughly 15 seconds for it to go from fading to completely invisible. I didn’t think much of it at first because I know satellites and debris can reflect the sun and create this fading light effect, but after about 10 seconds the light reappeared almost in the exact same spot it became invisible, this time moving in the complete opposite direction (North to South).  It moved completely the same, in a straight line and at the same slightly faster than a satellite speed.  The fade-in to visibility was much quicker than the fade-out, maybe 5 seconds till it appeared as bright as it was the first time.   I moved to the center of my driveway at this time, still facing East looking over my house.  Then it faded away completely again, only being visible this time for roughly 20 seconds, including the fade time, which was much quicker than the first time (it took only about 6-8 seconds). I kept looking in the same area where it disappeared this time (which was directly above my house, about half the distance from where it originated), still facing East, when it reappeared yet a third Time, this time moving either up or West/slightly north (It was hard to tell because of how high it was in My view).  It continued moving the same as previously, and was visible for about the same amount of Time as the second time before fading away completely.  This all happened under 2 minutes.  I figured it would continue to do this (or hoped I should say), so I ran into my house from the drive way through the Garage to get my Father. We ran out into the center of the driveway and looked East at the area where I had just seen it 2 minutes earlier, but did not see anything.  Then about 12 minutes later, my dad spotted it directly above our heads, moving from East to West in the same manner as before, short fade in to a longer fade out. It was longer visible after about 20 seconds.  I looked at my phone for time, and it was 11:14 PM.  We continued to search for about an hour, then we gave up. The whole thing has really got me interested in finding out what me and my father saw.  If there is a good explanation, I would really like to hear it, or if anyone else saw this or has seen this in the Solano County Area, I would also really like to know.

The sky had some scattered clouds on an off through out the night. Just before day break I was looking south about 70 degrees off the horizon I noticed what I thought to be Venus at about 4:19 am, but i realized that Venus had went down earlier in the evening ,about 10:00 pm, just when I tried to adjust my telescope it started moving north, and dropping in altitude.  It moved without sound it appeared to be a cylinder of light standing vertically.  It moved north slowly as it got closer about 45 seconds.  I live by a small county airport my house is under the landing pattern.  This LIGHT was flying the wrong direction within the landing pattern.  It then changed direction and headed east at a much greater speed. I watched it til it was gone with binoculars.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
Big orange lights in SSE sky seen towards the air force base, at least 6, definately not airplanes.;2012-07-21 21:00:00;15 minutes +;Big orange lights in SSE sky seen towards the air force base, at least 6, definately not airplanes. The formation was like a triangle with a tail.  There was about 6 + objects. I noticed them as I saws Mars to the SW, then I saw a way brighter round light orb that was orange like Mars in the SSE sky, its light faded then came back and then several more appeared. Also, about an hour later I saw a faint white 'shooting star' right where the later event happened in the SSE sky. It looked like it shot up (or down) from the air force base.   I also saw a red shooting star right after it, more towards the East though.  Met 3 other witnesses, me and one witness shared a similar even that happened to both of us, we both dropped an electronic device in our pools earlier that day.  I noticed more people out driving right when the lights were flying around, compared to an hour before.  Could have just been a busier street.  Very exciting!

13 silent orange lights observed for 19 minutes crossing the sky from west to east on an upward trajectory;2012-07-21 21:14:00;19 minutes;13 silent orange lights observed for 19 minutes crossing the sky from west to east on an upward trajectory Date of sighting:  7/21/12 Time of sighting: 9:14 PM to 9:33 PM Location:  Solano County, CA. Number of individuals present at the time of the sighting were 3 adults. Lat:  38.38      Lon:  -121.96  Weather conditions reported by the National Weather Service at 9:53 PM PDT:   Temperature:  87 degrees F  (31 degrees C)  Humidity:  21% Wind Speed:  S 3mph  Barometer:  29.83 in (1009.9mb)  Dewpoint:  42 degrees F  (6 degrees C)  Visibility:  10.00 miles  Heat Index:  84 degrees F  (29 degrees C) Sky conditions from observer’s point of view:  Clear with stars visible Ground lighting:  Street lights present   Report:  A total of 13 orange lights rose in the sky from due west and followed a straight-line course, passing overhead, towards the eastern sky.  As viewed by the observer looking straight up (0 degrees) relative to the eastern horizon (90 degrees) each light appeared to fade/get smaller at about 20 degrees, and then was no longer visible.  Each appeared to be climbing. The first two lights appeared individually, one after another. This was followed by a formation of 4 lights and the formation changed. A second formation of 4 lights followed the first. After the formations disappeared 3 more lights in succession appeared and disappeared. Except for the reformation described above all lights behaved the same and disappeared when they reached the same part of the sky. None of us could say how fast they were traveling but it appeared to be about 2 minutes for an individual light to rise from the west and disappear (we did not think to time them). All lights were the same color (an orange color very similar to sodium vapor street lights). All agreed that the lights appeared to flicker (like a candle flame) as they journeyed across the sky. None of us were able to identify any sounds that we could associate with these lights. Travis AFB is 9 miles from our location and there are usually flights in the air.  None were observed during the period we are reporting. Nut Tree Airport is 5 miles from our location.  One small aircraft was observed in the air during this incident.;38.3671559322034;-121.972

I was driving through a residential neighborhood and turned to my right to see 5 strange red circular lights hoovering about 0.5-1 mile away.  They were too far apart to make up one gigantic object, so I would say they were 5 individual crafts either moving slowly or hoovering in one spot.  They seemed to be observing and had no sudden movements.  They made a noise that wasn't quite like an aircraft, but a strange hum as I opened the window. I also saw another car with two people stopped and look at the objects.  As I began driving and got onto another street, I saw another car parked observing the objects.  The red circular lights went from five, to three, to one, then vanished completely 2 minutes after I encountered them.

It was a large purple light attached to a few smaller green lights.  They were very bright in the sky.  They did not move but just hovered there for about three minutes then it disappeared.   We were driving home from a friends house at around 1:50 AM and we all three saw the light in the distance but as we tried to get a closer look it disappeared.

Lights very high in the atmosphere passed over 1 at a time spaced evenly and in a straight line. ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-04 19:54:00;13 minutes;Lights very high in the atmosphere passed over 1 at a time spaced evenly and in a straight line. They were moving east. As they passed overhead, they disappeared. As I was watching 3 dimly lit orbs raced by traveling south. One was traveling in a straight line while the other 2 danced around on each side. Another light (very high in the atmosphere slowly moved overhead and stopped and hovered for at least 5 minutes. Very weird. They were definitely too high to be military aircraft and way too many to be satellites.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
