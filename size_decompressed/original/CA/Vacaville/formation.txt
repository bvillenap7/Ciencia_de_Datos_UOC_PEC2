75-100 Light formation over Vacaville, California;2020-12-04 18:13:00;5minutes;75-100 Light formation over Vacaville, California Dec04, 2020, 1813hrs. Vacaville, CA. While walking my dog, I looked up to see 75-100 lights moving from West to East across the sky, parallel to HWY 80 in California. Approx 5-10 miles North of it. The lights, from my angle, were the same size and brightness as Saturn is right now. They were traveling at slow speed. They were in-line formation. For the most part, they were almost the all the same distance from one another, in line, for the exception of 4-5 which were above or below the line. They traveled at a speed similar to a small-engine plane. By the time they flew over (approximately) central Vacaville they disappeared one by one, once they arrived to the exact same location in the sky. The Travis Air-Force Base is close-by, and so is the Nut Tree Private Airport. We are used to many different aircraft here, and have NEVER seen this phenomenon. No other aircraft was seen in the sky at this time.  This was witnessed by myself(walking my dog) as well as my family(from my house around the corner);38.3671559322034;-121.972
I saw 5-7 orange/red lights in a V shaped formation fly directly over my head.  ((Possibly Starlink satellites??));2021-04-09 20:45:00;10 seconds;I saw 5-7 orange/red lights in a V shaped formation fly directly over my head with no sound emitting from the UFO. I was taking the trash out and looked up at the clear night sky when suddenly my eyes were immediately drawn to these 5-7 orange/red lights in the sky. These lights were all the same size and were in a perfect V-shaped formation heading west to east just over Vacaville, CA.  These lights flew straight over my head and were moving extremely fast. I first thought that perhaps the orange street lights were playing with my eyes with a glare or something, so I ran into the middle of the street to see if anything would change but nothing changed whatsoever.  These objects were roughly 3000-5000ft in the sky . I suspected that this could be some type of military aircraft but the thing that made it clear that these were not military was how silent these crafts were.  No sound whatsoever, just lights.  This is my first UFO sighting and it matches how everyone else describes these crafts.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
