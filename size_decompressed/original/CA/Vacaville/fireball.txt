Fireballs seen in Vacaville, CA.;1982-08-17 19:00:00;8 minutes;fire balls seen in calif. (this happened many years ago and the dates are approximate.)  two friends and i were walking to one of there houses at about 7 or 8 pm. it was just getting dark and it was a warm clear eavning, i think it was somewhere around august of 1982 or so, i was about 13 or 14 years old at the time, i am 44 now!  anyways...while walking on this quite night i noticed something in the sky and told my friends to look up at what i saw!... there was 3 balls of fire flying about 200 yards away just above to the right a bit of us. they were in almost a V formation, traveling very slowly and from roughly a south to north direction.  they were so low that we could hear the fire blowing in the wind as they moved through the sky. they had small trails of fire behind them and as we watched, one of the fire balls went out compleatly but we could still see it flying with the other two. they were round, about 10 to 20 feet across and dark in color except for the fire of course...  they were way to low and traveling way to slow to be meteors or comits.  they wer! e not planes or helicoptors and were silent except for the wind blowing through the fire. my friends and i just watched as they kept on ther way untell we could not see them anymore,(about 6 to 8 min.)

Large red light appeared in the sky and descended directly down to the ground.;2003-12-13 18:00:00;30 seconds;Large red light appeared in the sky and descended directly down to the ground. We observed a large bright red light out over a large field, we were driving in a car, the light seemed to appear, fairly low, and it was descending downwards, it caught our attention, it looked like a fireball, from what we could see it seemed to have crashed in an area where there were trees. When it landed we could not see the light any longer. We live near Travis AFB.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
Orangish color sphere shape flying over Vacaville, CA;2015-10-12 03:42:00;5-6 minutes;Orangish color sphere shape flying over Vacaville, CA.   I saw something in the sky tonight over Vacaville traveling from a North to Southerly direction not quite going towards the base.  It was a roundish not overly bright orange color. I see planes all the time and even with their exterior lights on this was not something I have seen before.  It was not particularly face but it was steady and seems to hover a couple of times before moving on again.  I did not hear anything that sounded like a plan or helicopter.  It was fairly low because I lost it behind houses and neighbors trees.  It was not directly above me maybe half mile away at closets point.  This was a 3:43 AM I know because I looked at the clock before stepping outside.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
