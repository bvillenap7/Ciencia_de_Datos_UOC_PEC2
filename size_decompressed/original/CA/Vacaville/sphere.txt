Travis Air Force Base vicinity Orange Orbs;2012-01-08 19:15:00;2 min;Travis Air Force Base vicinity Orange Orbs On Jan 08 2012 my husband called me outside as he took the garbage out, at the side of our home I looked up into the sky over Travis Air Force Base and witnessed 3 orange colored orbs stationary in the sky.  They were in a triangular formation and appeared to be individual orbs.  My husband expressed that there had been 6 in the sky one minute ago, and ran back into the house to get his phone to try to take a picture.  I felt dizzy and grabbed the wall to steady myself.   When I looked back up to the orbs, one had gone. Now the two that were left were still in the same position as when I first saw them, then the one that was lower in the sky began to pulse, and I was afraid that it would go away before my husband could get a picture.  He waited for his phone to load and the lower orb flashed and in my opinion, shot out of site toward the South East.  The final orb that was a little higher and to the right of the one that just “left” was now beginning to pulse.  It moved down 2 inches in my view, and then shot off as well, toward the South East. We stood there in awe for a min, repeating, ”What was that?”, “What were those?”  I mentioned that maybe they were comets burning through the atmosphere, or perhaps something new that TAFB is testing in weaponry, but have NOT seen any news of this.  We searched the local newspaper and NASA’s web site to see if there were any comets that night, but found nothing.  We viewed some you tube videos labeled “Orange orbs” and some other people have captured this same phenomena in many other areas of our country and even in other countries. I read one opinion that they may be a plasma weapon of defense that is used to “melt” something from the sky.  This may be a laser that creates a photon ball of lightening in the sky and then can be maneuvered using micro-waves, a lot like the drones that are manipulated and used in the middle-east right now.  This makes sense to me, but have not been able to find anything official.  The persons opinion of this was linked to a web site…sciencenews.com  I'm an educated at home mother of three (and a student) with a career history in Human Resources, Accounting and Education.  My husband is a Navy Veteran, who is a hard working man and student.  We are rational, open minded, California natives.  I believe there is an explaination for this event, and have felt compelled to find out these orange orbs source of being.  Any help would be appreciated.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
Four military planes monitoring three UFO's hovering diagonally in stationary position.;2013-12-07 18:30:00;22:40;Four military planes monitoring three UFO's hovering diagonally in stationary position We saw three perfectly spaced lights hovering diagonally in a stationary position.  Opposite of the unindentified flying objects, were four military planes (fighter jets) flying in formation, one after another at a high rate of speed.  The planes were monitoring the objects from a distance.  Aircraft altitude unknown, although flying low approximately 2000 feet agl.  UFO's were disc shaped and had bright lights similar to Xenon headlights found on cars.  Towards the end of the sighting, the military planes flew over Nut Tree Airport and as soon as they curved around to ascend, the UFO's vanished quickly within a blink of an eye.
