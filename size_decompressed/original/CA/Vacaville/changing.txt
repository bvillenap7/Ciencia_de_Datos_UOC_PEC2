Bright white kite shaped light morphs into sickle shape as it turns before flattening out over Vacaville Hills on Aug. 19, 7:45pm.;2007-08-19 19:45:00;2 minutes;Bright white kite shaped light morphs into sickle shape as it turns before flattening out over Vacaville Hills on Aug. 19, 7:45pm. Vacaville, California, Sunday, August 19, 2007, 19:45, my son and I were driving in heavy traffic westbound on I80 between Nut Tree Road and Alamo Drive.  We both noticed an object slowly rising over a ridge of foothills between Vacaville and Fairfield, CA.  The object was a bright white-yellowish light and its shape changed as it changed direction.  As the traffic was heavy it took us about 90 seconds to travel the distance between the two roads. Initially it had a diamond like polygon shape and I thought it was a cloud.  My son said it was moving too quickly to be a cloud, but not quickly enough to be a plane.  It was an extremely bright light.  As it rose vertically, the leading edge lost its rectangular shape and became rounded.  It was trailing a bright jet trail.  Then it turned to the south (left) and became sickle-shaped, still trailing a jet trail.  As it completed the turn, it flattened and narrowed and became straight in shape, still trailing a jet trail.  At that point it picked up speed, and was on a slightly angled upward path.  By this time I was at Alamo Drive and we lost view of it. My son is 12 and fascinated with airplanes.  His grandfather was a pilot who flew for the military and World Airways.  My son just had his eyes tested at 20/20.  I am 51 years old and a volunteer at the Vacaville Police Department.  Neither of us has ever reported a UFO before and we donâ€™t know anyone who has ever claimed to see one.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
What ever it was that flew by me I for sure have never seen before.  ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.  PD));2015-12-22 18:05:00;3 minutes;What ever it was that flew by me I for sure have never seen before. It was 6:05 pm when I was walking from my next door neighbor's house towards my house when I looked up and saw a round or egg shape ball of light coming very fast up in the sky. It must have been going 1500-2500 knots.  I stopped to watch it as it flew like a missile or a rocket ball that had tracer light streaming behind it.  It flew at an angle up and over the direction of Travis Air Force Base.  My neighbor and I both watched it slow down to a stop and appeared to be angled down as we could see light coming out of it. We both agreed that it was egg or round in shape.  There was no sound at all and it seemed to be about the same size as a four door car.  We both kept walking following behind it as not to loose it. It flew a distance I see plains fly all the time accept plains take about 5-10 minutes do fly the same distance. I could not believe what I was seeing. I went in my house to document what I had just seen and I found my digital recorder and tried to go! back over everything that we witnessed. When I went back outside from the original event it was 6:25 pm it is now 7:30 pm as I am writing this report and I just herd sirens like police with a weird humming and now I am hearing a loud airplane engine as I look there is what looks like a boing 777 flying in a big circle around my house and area where the said event took place.
