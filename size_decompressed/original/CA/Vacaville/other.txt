Bright firey red orange crescent shaped object hwy 505 north Vacaville Calif  6/4/11 10:30pm;2011-06-04 22:30:00;10 min;Bright firey red orange crescent shaped object hwy 505 north Vacaville Calif  6/4/11 10:30pm I was driving on Hwy 505 North between Vacaville and Winters Calf. around 10:30pm on Saturday 6/4/11  The sky was really dark and I glanced out my drivers side window and saw what I thought was an eclipse of the moon.  It was bright firey red orange and shaped like a half moon or crescent shape.  It would get really bright and then sort of fade.  When it faded you could see red lights.   Then the crescent shape would appear again bright red orange.  It looked like it had dropped down lower in the sky.   There were cars driving slow in the fast lane watching this object.   I've never seen anything like this before, and wish I had taken a video camera with me.   I would be interested to know if anyone else has seen this or something similar. ((NUFORC Note:  We have written the witness, to inquire whether the object might have been the waxing, crescent Moon in the western sky.  PD));38.3671559322034;-121.972
No sound from greenish/white light shooting very close above tree line over neighbors house in vacaville ca.;2012-10-27 21:00:00;8 seconds;no sound from greenish/white light shooting very close above tree line over neighbors house in vacaville ca. I was in the back yard looking up  the moon was to my left, when a light caught my eye above the tree under the moon in my neighbors yard. It was so quick I did not have much time to focus, there was no sound at all. There was a greenish/ white light at the beginning of it and it kinda had a tail ,like a commit. It went in a straight line above the tree's rather close. All this leads me to believe it was not any aircraft, commit or meteor but I do not think anyone else saw this anomaly.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
