We have a lot of trees in our yard but the sky was open in the area I was looking.  I saw a bright yellow light moving across the sky.   At first I thought it was a shooting star but it was moving too slow, almost the speed of an airplane.  There were no lights like an airplane, just a tear drop shaped object.  The tear drop was horizontal and very bright yellow, and then after about 3 seconds it just disappeared or blinked out.  I don't know what it was but it wasn't an airplane.  It may have been a shooting star but it was way bigger and slower than any shooting star I have ever seen.   Also it didn't have a trail.  I live in Vacaville California, and was looking in the Northeast sky.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
