Odd light dropping what a probe;1995-07-15 02:20:00;5 minutes;odd light dropping what a prob I was returning from a night out with friends talking outside my home, when we noticed all was quite  ((sic.  quiet)).  I was looking at the sky when i saw what appeared a light but its was odd, it was like a bright old style street lamp color orange yellow but unlike the street lights didn't give off a holo nor too bright to look at.  3 of us were now watching this object and then faded out and about 20 seconds later appeared in a different location further away so I decided too wake my sister and mother too see if what we where seeing they would see.  I went back outside and it moved again too another location by the time mom and sister came out it moved about 8 times ruffly and when I mean move it blinked out and appeared in another location jumping what would be about few miles at a time staying in a ruff 5 mile radius.  Then the odd thing from the light came out what looked like a flare toward the ground which dropped out the light and leaving a fiery trail behind it and then it stopped for about 2 seconds and with a flash like a shooting star went too the ground and then we heard a thud, now 2 of the 5 ppl watching this started praying which freaked me out, then the flare that dropped came back up again like a shooting star were it stopped before the light and went into the light which faded out not too come back.
