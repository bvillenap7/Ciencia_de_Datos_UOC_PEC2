Disk shaped object hovered briefly then travelled eastward, captured video footage of it as it left.;2005-05-28 11:35:00;5 minutes;Disk shaped object hovered briefly then travelled eastward, captured video footage of it as it left. Went out to the backyard to check on the pool. (Sometimes, the Polaris sweeper gets stuck or tangled, which requires regular babysitting when it is in operation.)  While doing so, I heard a plane flying nearby.  I like airplanes so I try to catch a glimpse of them when I hear them. I could tell it was close by the sound but couldn't see it anywhere.  A few seconds later, I saw it pop up from behind some trees that were blocking my view to the northwest. It was a small single-propeller airplane, probably a Cessna. As I watched it for a second or so, I noticed a dark object roughly in the same line of sight as the plane but approximately twice as far and about twice the altitude.  At first, the object seemed to be changing shapes and I thought it was a bird or perhaps a garbage bag that the wind had gotten hold of. As I kept watching, I noticed that the object was stationary. By then I was fixated and I realized that the object was not changing shapes but rather was changing its orientation, which made it appear to change shapes.  The way the object's profile was changing was consistent with a disk shape that seemed to be wobbling, much like the way a spinning coin wobbles just before it rests on the table... only much slower. While I watched, I saw it start to move slowly and steadily towards the east. When I first saw it, it was directly north of me in my backyard.  There was a layer of scattered clouds at the time and they made for a good background to provide contrast for the object. Once, the sun peaked out for a few seconds and I caught a glimpse of a shine that made the object appear metallic.  As the object moved away, I mustered up the will to peel my eyes from it and ran into the house to get the new camcorder I bought a little over a month ago. My wife was napping at the time so I didn't have to explain my odd behavior.  By the time I returned to the backyard, the object had gotten very far. To further exacerbate the situation, I'm not very proficient with the video camera and had to use Easycam mode and hope for the best while I tried to control my excitement. I captured approximately two minutes of footage showing the object moving away from me in an eastward direction.  I zoomed in on the object a couple of times to highlight it but most of the footage is unzoomed to keep surrounding trees and structures within the frame for reference. The camera that was used is a Sony DCR-DVD403. I have sent a copy of the DVD that it produced to your address in Seattle. The third clip on the disk has the most useful footage.  As for me, I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering (B.A.Sc.) from the University of Ottawa. For the past twelve years, I have been cultivating a successful career in the field of IT. I am currently employed by a major IT outsourcing company as an Infrastructure Specialist. Due to the attention that this may draw, I would prefer to remain anonymous, or at least have my personal information withheld.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
saucer octagon shape lights on corners and a blue light on the bottom;2005-09-30 07:50:00;10 minutes;saucer octagon shape lights on corners and a blue light on the bottom I had picked up my grandchildren, twins a boy and girl 8 years old, in Patterson, Calif. which I do every other weekend.  We were on highway 113 out of Vacaville when  I saw lights off to the right.  We are close to Travis Air Force Base and we always have planes around the area so I didn't think too much about the lights I was seeing.  There was what looked light a plane off to our right coming toward us but seemed  very low.  I said to the twins, look at that plane.   When it started to pass over us we looked for the wings and the normal shape of a plane.  It flew over us, that was when we saw that there where no wings, it was round but a octagon shape with lights on each corner and as it passed over us it had a blue light in the middle of the craft.  It made no sound.  My granddaughter said was that a ufo?  We watched it keep going lower and it looked like it was going to land in a grove of trees.  I was driving but my grandson said that it looked like it just took off out of the trees.  The twins where very scared and did not want to talk about it untill we got to their Dads home.  We then compared what we had seen and we all saw the same shape and lights.  I have never seen anything like this before, the reason I am writing this is to see if anyone else on the road that night saw anything like we saw.;38.3671559322034;-121.972

The object was saucer â€“ like in appearance and had lights along the edge blinking one after the other. In relation to a normal sized star the UFO was about ten times the size the size of a dime if held furthest from your face, only looking at the side view. The UFO traveled at about the speed of an airplane, maybe a little slower and lower to the ground than an aircraft would travel. The distance was about a foot in the sky, in relation to the dime.  After I would say a minute the UFO disappeared.          (MOTHER)At approximately 9:40pm on May 26th, 2007 I was driving West on Orange drive in Vacaville California, when I saw something moving up in the sky.  It was saucer shaped/cylinder and it had rotating blinking lights.  My daughter was in the passenger side of my car and I noticed after a few seconds, she was watching the same thing as me. It was moving West, probably Northwest.  It was the size of quarter, If I was holding a quarter arm length from my face, that would be the approx size.  The quarter being sideways in position. My guess would be it was not flying as high as an airplane, but closer to where an airplane would be if getting ready to head in towards a runway to land.  I continued to drive west on Orange Drive, and my daughter was trying to use her cell phone to video tape this object.  I pulled into the parking lot of Staples and stopped the car so she could aim her cell phone, about this time the object appeared to vanished from where it was traveling, It sort of looked like it in hyper speed turned North , I remember seeing it off in the distance , but I can not be 100 percent sure that is where it went. All this happened in approximately one minute.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
