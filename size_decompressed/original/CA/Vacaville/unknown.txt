Bright light, very bright light.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect an overflight of the International Space Station.  PD));2015-05-30 23:03:00;1 minutes;Bright light, very bright light. We saw a unusually bright light moving from West to East.  It was moving at a satellite speed.  What caught our attention was how bright it was and large.  Satellites are small and not so bright.  This was bright.  And the brightness did not change with the distance it traveled.  No blinking lights so I can safely say it was not an airplane.  Weird!

On the seventeenth of February, at approximately 14:43, I was working on my taxes on the computer and I heard what I thought at first was rain but it got to be very loud, so I opened the front door to look outside and it was hailing pretty hard.  It continued to hail until approximately 15:00.  I decided to take my dog out, was curious what he would think of the remaining hail on the ground, and nothing else seemed out of the ordinary at the time.   Once my dog and I came back in I took a peak out the back-sliding glass door and the clouds with the sun looked really gorgeous.  So, I decided to take some pictures at 15:13 exactly.  I took 6 pictures facing West from my back yard before reviewing them with my LG V40 phone.  I saw this little black triangle and zoomed in the best I could and I started seeing it most the pictures.  At the time I could not see it as clearly on my phone, but it might be almost cone shaped, or rounded.  I thought maybe I would catch something else if I took more photos and videos afterwards at 15:15 and later but nothing else showed up.  I was curious to see if anyone else reported anything strange in the area or possibly was able to get a video or more evidence of what it was or could be.  I marked that there may have been 2 objects.  There is a green orb that definitely looked out of place, but I didnâ€™t really notice it as much on my phone, more so on my computer monitor.  It definitely shows up in 3 of the pictures.  I know it is a phone camera but my phone actually has 3 different lenses in the back and one is a telescopic lens so the pictures are pretty decent.  I hope this helps with evidence.  I did not see the objects directly, only in the pictures and they or it seemed to maybe be towards Pena Adobe Park.;38.3671559322034;-121.972
