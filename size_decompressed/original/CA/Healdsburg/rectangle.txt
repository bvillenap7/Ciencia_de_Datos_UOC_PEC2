Similar to Pheonix lights story. I was at a winery in the Dry Creek Valley looking east when I saw this rectangular object moving in a southerly direction about to go behind the range at the horizon. It had white spots on it in what appeared to be evenly spaced. The object was massively large. I mean gigantic.  Approximately 1 minute went by when jets flew from northwest to the southeast in the direction of the object that had already went behind the range. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Not made in U. S. of A.;2001-09-05 21:30:00;15 min.;Not made in U. S. of A. While having a smoke,my attention was drawn to the sky dead West.I saw what appeared to be landing lights of a aircraft flying in a dead reconing east direction.What made me pay fixed attention to this craft was the fact that I never have observed any kind of aircraft flying this flight pattern approache.It was moving almost at a deliberate slow speed.I noticed a very bright light on what I think would be the tips of each wing.At the middle point of this object Inoticed a smaller light that appeared to be slowly spinning.As it got closer,I suddenly got an eary feeling that what I was looking at was not made in the U.S.of A.It moved very slow.As it traversed directly over me,I noticed that the stars in the night sky would be blocked out.But,what was rally scary was the fact that this craft made not a sound.Thera was no engine sounds,n ot even a whoosh or hiss.Well thats it.I only hope someone else saw what ai saw.
