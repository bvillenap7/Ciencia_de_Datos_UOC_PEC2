Bright orange oblong object flying very low over house. Healdsburg, California.;2012-04-05 23:00:00;2 seconds;bright orange oblong object flying very low over house. Healdsburg, California. I was in the backyard letting the dog out when I looked up and saw a bright orange light, oblong in shape, flying silently by. It wasn't flying all the fast but by the time I saw it, it was close to the trees.  It flew right between the tops of two trees and was gone.  My husband was in the house on the couch and he saw it through the tall window we have.  We live on top of a mountain so as it went through the tops of the trees it was at a slight downward angle.;38.6159;-122.8616
