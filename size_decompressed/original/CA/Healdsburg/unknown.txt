Radiant lights in pairs, one after the other, following in a controlled line, west to east, continuing in the line.  They disappeared one after the other after traveling away.   The light didn't appear to be electrical.;38.6159;-122.8616

My wife and I were driving north on HWY 101 up to Geyserville, CA, from Santa Rosa, CA. After passing Healdsburg, CA.  We pulled onto Alexander Valley RD.  We were going to a casino.  On the way up we had noticed very strange looking Sunset? I took a movie with my phone.  A Very bright area in the movie.  Then we noticed a bright blue line?  If you look at the movie you can see it on the upper left.  This Line was similar to a jet stream but it did not dissipate?    It was solid from where we were.  You could look back behind us and could see that it extended clear back towards Santa Rosa.  Thatâ€™s over 28 miles.  We had reached the casino and we could no longer see it after dark.  It was not a jet stream, it was bright blue.  We asked others at the casino it they had seen it.  Even the guards.  But no one had.  But it was there because we did film it although I was lighter in the film.;38.6159;-122.8616
