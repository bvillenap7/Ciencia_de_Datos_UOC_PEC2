I observed perhaps half a dozen stops and starts before redwood trees blocked view.;38.6159;-122.8616

It was a bright light about ten miles  high and moving west.  When it got over a mountain another one appeared and was moving in the same direction.  They both continued west and over the mountains then dissapeared.I know it was not a typical aircraft,because they appeared out of thin air.  I'm a true believer of ufo's.I was skeptical before but not anymore.;38.6159;-122.8616
Entire sky lit up briefly.;2015-11-05 15:20:00;~3 seconds;Entire Sky Lit Up Briefly I live in a rural area surrounded by vineyards and forests and was with my uncle John and my dog Rufus.  It was shortly before dark and we were walking down a slight hill, towards the creek that is adjacent to our property.  We were about 50 feet down the trail from my driveway when the entire sky lit up for a very short period of time.  I remember a chill down my spine and a feeling that something was not quite right.   I looked back and to my right at my uncle who was a couple of steps behind me and he looked slightly confused as well, but with no obvious reason something had happened we continued on our walk.   I didnâ€™t think much of it, but upon returning home I realized approximately an hour had passed, when we were quite obviously only gone for about 15 minutes.  And that is why I will always remember the fifth of November.;38.6159;-122.8616
