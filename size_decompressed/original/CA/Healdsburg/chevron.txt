Three chevron shaped objects streaked across the sky traveling east to west.  They were directly above me. I was trying to locate the galaxy andromeda and was focused on the constellation Cassiopeia when the lights came into view.  They traveled in a delta formation.  As they crossed overhead they separated in the western sky and disappeared out of view.  My visual event lasted no more than five seconds. My first inclination was that they were some sort of night flying white birds.  However dismissed that notion as they were traveling very fast. I thought also that they were iridium flares however I am sure they do not occur in threes.;38.6159;-122.8616
