Very bright flickering lights hovering over mountain ridge in Russian River/Healdsburg, CA;2009-11-15 19:30:00;5 hrs;Very bright flickering lights hovering over mountain ridge in Russian River/Healdsburg, CA This was our third night in Russian River and I had not seen anything like this the prior two evenings. These lights were far brighter and much larger than any star, airplane, satellite or tower I had ever seen.  It was a straight line of approximately 7-9 lights, flickering rapidly and hovering over the ridge of the mountain.  It appeared to be a disk shaped object. It was much higher than any tree or structure on the side or top of the ridge.  They were the most brilliant lights I have ever seen, and no one in my party of four could come up with a reasonable explanation for them.  Even though the photograph I took is far from doing it justice, it still shows how much brighter this object was compared to everything else in the sky.  It was still hovering when I went to bed at 12:30am, but gone when I awoke at 7:30am.;38.6159;-122.8616
