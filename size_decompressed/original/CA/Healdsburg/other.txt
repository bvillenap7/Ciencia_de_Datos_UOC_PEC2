I saw a very bright white object (about 10 degrees west of due north) which looked like a comet (meteor) or a re-entry vehicle. It was unusually large, and sufficiently bright to be seen over the street lights of our small town.  It appeared to fragment as it approached my horizon (about 30 degrees elevation)and then was extinguished. Except for its substantial size and brightness and fragmenting, it looked like a meteor.  The trajectory was from about north east (at about 2 o'clock) toward the earth about north west (at about 7 or 8 o'clock).  There were no prior noises heard, indicating it was a locally launched rocket.  I can't give much more info, but if you would like to talk to me, 707-((number deleted)).
