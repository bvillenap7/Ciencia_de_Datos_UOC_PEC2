Fol;2012-02-07 18:40:00;30 minutes+;Watched a flying object over Bob Hope Drive with my sister.  There was quite a few cars on the road so I'm sure others saw it, too.  Followed it as it got further and further away.  It was flying in a circular motion for quite a while - as we parked along a secluded road to watch it in disbelief.   Flew further away (Easterly direction).   The craft had lights along its circular border and one red light on top.  It had the shape of a toy spinner/spinner top.

Three orange/red objects tracking across the sky. Easily visible viewed clearly by 4 adults.;2015-04-04 22:00:00;2 minute;Three orange/red objects tracking across the sky. Easily visible viewed clearly by 4 adults. We saw three orange/red circular objects flying across the sky from west to east. They flew in a chevron formation each faded out in turn -- the one furthest north fading first. Curiously after they faded away, one seemed to reappear back towards the west.  They were clearly visible.  When the first faded it seemed to fly away from its low trajectory further into space, but I am not certain this was the case.  Certainly while they were visible they were easily viewed and appeared to track across the sky at a leisurely pace.;33.7632;-116.4229
Over Twenty White Dots in a line ~ Some Flared ~ Rancho Mirage, CA;2021-05-22 21:44:00;2 minutes;Over Twenty White Dots in a line ~ Some Flared ~ Rancho Mirage, CA Last Saturday night, May 22, 2021, in Rancho Mirage, California (Palm Springs Desert Area) at 9:44 PM, I was in my backyard, facing  316 degrees North West, standing in the middle of the lawn with my friend. (Please note ~ that my backyard is open with unobstructed views of the sky and it was dark) Then out of nowhere, about thirty miles away, a U shaped group of six white dots were leading a line of  three white dots that were spaced exactly apart. Then new white dots kept appearing at the end of the line, one behind the other, from the exact same spot, adding to the line. This white dot line grew to about twenty white dots, some would flare and continued moving North and then disappearing around 344 degrees North.  It was almost as if these white dots were being born, like a large dog litter one after another and then getting in line to follow their mother. This sighting took about two minutes total. My friend captured over one minute on his cell phone if ! you'd like to see it.;33.7632;-116.4229
