Strange craft of lights that merged into one seen hovering above the Coachella Valley.;2019-09-24 10:50:00;~10 minutes;Strange craft of lights that merged into one seen hovering above the Coachella Valley. I stepped outside into the backyard late last night just before 11:00pm and noticed what appeared to be a string of lights, similar to the landing and beacon lights on an aircraft and about the same level of brightness as stars, that were hovering horizontally and at first stationary in the sky to the southeast of my location near Palm Springs. I observed the anomaly for several minutes, taking a few long exposure nighttime shots on my phone, as the string of lights came together forming what appeared to be one single source of light that then began to move slowly in a southern direction, changing direction slightly towards the east then vanishing completely from view.  There was a second that I at first thought was a star further off in the distance where this craft was moving towards, and this light also disappeared not long after the first.  I'll also mention that were no (zero) registered aircraft in the vicinity of the lights throughout the entire duratio! n of the event.;33.7632;-116.4229
