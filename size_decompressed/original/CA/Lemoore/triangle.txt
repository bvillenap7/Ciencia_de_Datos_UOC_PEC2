I saw a large, triangluar shaped object with off-white lights at each corner slowing moving about 3-500ft high in the sky.;1994-06-15 03:00:00;5mins;Summary : I saw a large, triangluar shaped object with off-white lights at each corner slowing moving about 3-500 ft high in the sky. I believe that it was the summer of 1994. I was sitting in my patrol car at about 0300 hrs., when I noticed movement in the sky to the north. What I saw was a very large, triangular shaped object with off-white lights at each corner slowing moving from north to southeast. The craft could have only been maybe 300-500 feet high and there was absoulutely no sound coming from it. I watched in dis-belief and tried to make sense of it. I thought about the Stealth bomber, but wouldn't that at least make some sound? I could tell that this object was solid, as the middle of it darkened out the clear sky behind it. The lights seemed erie, not bright, but not dull, and they were steady, but also seemed to flicker. It took maybe two minutes for the craft to pass over me and as it began leaving my field of vision, I finally realized that I needed to follow it. I followed it for about another two minutes as it travelled southeast out of my city limits and Im not sure why, but I decided to stop my pursuit. I also am not sure why I didn't tell anyone about this incident until fairly recently, when I told my wife. I'm a 15 year police veteran, who has seen alot of weird stuff late at night, but I've never seen anything like this. There is a Naval Air Station nearby, but I've been out there many times and as far as I know, they don't have anything like what I saw.;36.2653;-119.819086363636
I observed a something that apeared to be a glowing orange and white ball over Naval Air Station Lemoore. I was observing this about 5;2003-06-26 22:30:00;30 minutes;I observed a something that apeared to be a glowing orange and white ball over Naval Air Station Lemoore. I was observing this about 5 miles away from the base. As I was observing that I was distracted by a Triangle shaped object thet flew directly over me. It was a good distance up, but I could make out from the glow of the lights that it was a triangle. I watched it slowly drift away. as it went overhead it made no sound. I focused my attention back on the glowing object over the air station. this object moved slowly to the south then moved north slowly and kept going. I know it was at a fairly low altitude because I could see it move through the trees that were in my field of vision. I think they are doing tests on some new technology. There were also alot of military jets flying around earlier.;36.2653;-119.819086363636

Triangle Shaped Object Red w/Green Lights - No Sound;2014-07-29 21:10:00;60-90 seconds;Triangle Shaped Object Red w/Green Lights - No Sound My husband and I were driving on Highway 41 towards Fresno, Ca.  This is flat farmland country and you can see for miles.   We had a clear view of the horizon at all times, when we approached Highway 198. I saw a large triangle formation above us (approx. 500 feet), with 5 lights, green with red behind the green lights.  There was 1 in the middle and 2 down each side.   This object appeared to be at least a football field in width, we have no idea on length.  I yelled to my husband what is that, he was as startled as I was.  It appeared to change shape into a straight line, mimicking the radio towers we have seen in various locations.  This object made no noise, we had our windows down.  We just couldn't believe what we were seeing.   We immediately pulled off the road within 10 seconds we were out the car, and we saw nothing, heard nothing and there were no radio towers.  The sky was just black, like we had seen the prior 50 miles. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.2653;-119.819086363636
