Bright light through an approaching fog spume, big circle of vapor, then V-cloud. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:10:00;5 minutes;Bright light through an approaching fog spume, big circle of vapor, then massive V-cloud, object travels NNW and is gone over the ocean Saw bright light beaming as if a helicopter searchlight,heading North/Northwest approx 60 degrees high over horizon apparently spewing contrail or smoke plume, then it blew through a smoke circle of it's own creation, then (and I'm guessing separation)blasted through a large lazy V-shaped cloud and kept going. Could see the light from it for a minute or two, heading off over the Pacific.  Assume missile of some kind, but no official launches scheduled for Vandenberg. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S.
