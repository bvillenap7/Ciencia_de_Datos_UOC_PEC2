Silent Flying Cross with 3 round white lights 41 N Lemoore sighting July 27, 2013;2013-07-27 22:09:00;1 minute;Silent Flying Cross with 3 round white lights 41 N Lemoore sighting July 27, 2013 Driving on Highway 41 N just entering Lemoore about a mile away from the 198 overpass at a little after 10 pm , looked to my right and saw what I thought might be a low flying crop duster.  I closed my sunroof vent thinking I don't want any residue/pesticide getting in my car.  But as the aircraft approached my vehicle I started to realize it wasn't making ANY noise.  I looked closer and realized it was flying weird, so I looked closer and noticed it was the shape of a cross flying AT me straight up and down like nothing man made that I know can fly. It had three round white lights at the top of the cross and each side of the cross.  As I was driving (very tired) and processing all that I saw, I waited for the flying object to make a sound or a gush of wind to push against my car and never felt or heard anything.  I quickly looked to my left and did not see a thing!!  What could disappear like that?  As I craned my neck around I saw what I thought looked like a Air traffic control tower (a small one ) in a field behind me dark, and lit up only by tons of tiny blue lights in the form of a circle at the top.  So weird...my husband woke up a few minutes later and I told him that I thought I saw a crop duster fly really close to our car but it didn't make any noise...he said  crop duster's don't fly at night so I told him what I saw and he said he would look on the internet to see if anyone else saw the same thing at the same time since there were tons of other cars on the road. And sure enough, there are....Kinda freaking out now.  Looks like these sightings have been going on for some time now...Weird.;36.2653;-119.819086363636
