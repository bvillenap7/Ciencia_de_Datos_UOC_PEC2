The color of the light was a yellow-white color. It was very bright and making very rapid movements! They also said that it left a trail behind it. My husband and his friend are in the Navy, and there is a Navy Airstation very close to their siting. They are convinced that it is not from the government! The light reappeared, turned red. They said it seemed to vanish as if leaving the atmosphere. I have never seen my husband so disturbed! He couldn't sleep! ((NUFORC Note:  We have checked for launches from Vandenberg AFB for this date, and our data show that none occurred.  We do not know what the witnesses may have observed.

Cluster of red flashing lights moving at high rate of speed from North to South.;2004-04-09 21:00:00;40 Seconds;Cluster of red flashing lights moving at high rate of speed from North to South. At approximately 2100 on Friday, 09 April, my wife and I were in the back yard star gazing.  We had just finished a discussion on Big and Little Dippers and North Star.  As I continued gazing straight up (90 degrees), I noticed a faint cluster of Lights.  Two things got my immediate attention.  The amount of lights that were flashing, and the high rate of speed the object seemed to be moving.  The lights appeared to be a cluster of lights, perhaps 6-10, and they were flashing, with red being the dominant color.  I watched for approximately 10 seconds.  During that time, the cluster kept flashing and moved across the sky from straight overhead to approx. 45 degrees.  I then pointed the object out to my wife who sighted it and we watched for approx. another 20 seconds until it disappeared due to long range at about 25 degrees on the horizon.  The cluster of lights appeared to be extremely high.  No  sound could be detected. Not knowing the size of the object or the size of the lights, it is difficult to estimate its altitude.  Making an estimate based on what I know about aircraft, sizes, speeds, etc., I estimate this cluster of lights could easily have been between 25,000 and 35,000 feet, or even higher.  The object traveled the entire time in a straight line from North to South.  The cluster of lights did not change relative position on each other, and the craft did not change direction.  I am not aware of any known aircraft that has up to 10 flashing lights on the underside.  As we went to bed later that evening, we listened to Coast to Coast on KMJ 580 (Fresno, Ca) and several callers had reported seeing this cluster of lights, also moving North to South, along the East Coast.  (Were there multiple targets that evening????, or was the same target making multiple passes?)   I am a retired Naval Aviator, still keeping a commercial, Instrument rating current in the civilian sector.  In over 5,000 flight hours, this is my sighting of a really wierd sighting in the sky which defied ! concepts of speed, shape, and lighting.  I trust that this information may be useful, perhaps in pinning down what took place on this evening, or perhaps in the future,;36.2653;-119.819086363636
