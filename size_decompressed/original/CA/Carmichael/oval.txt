November 29th 2013 in Carmichael Ca. myself and a friend were going to the store about 11 30 pm. I looked up and about halfway on the horizon I saw a large red oval shape traveling straight up in the sky.   I nudged my friend and said, ``Look at that,`` pointing to the object in the sky.  Both amazed we walked to that direction of the object in the sky. The glowing red oval object continued to rise straight up very fast.  As it reached very high in the sky it started to cloak until all that was seen was a very small faint almost clear dot than it started moving back and forth a few times very fast.  It than starting to come back down as it did it looked like an orb around the dot and it gained red color.  The closer it got to the ground it took on the oval shape and was fire red with a little blue.  It came down and what seemed very close to the ground from where we were.  It disappeared behind an apt. building from our view point and seemed to have been going to the ground somewhere nearby. It is an amazing, beautiful and unforgettable sighting.;38.6283;-121.3307
