Chevron-shaped craft seen during Perseid Meteor Shower;2016-08-11 23:30:00;~1 minute;Chevron-shaped craft seen during Perseid Meteor Shower While viewing the Perseid Meteor Shower between 11:30 and 12:30 at night, I saw one chevron-shaped craft gliding quietly across the sky headed north coming from the south-east.  There were rectangle-shaped lights on each side of the craft emitting extremely low light. I was able to see it because my eyes were adjusted to the darkness and I was scanning the sky for the movement of meteors.   I don't think most people would have noticed the craft.  It was grey or black and it blended in with the sky very well.;38.6283;-121.3307
