Red and blue lights streaking accross sky;2008-11-23 23:00:00;1-2 seconds;Red and blue lights streaking accross sky I witnessed red and blue lights streak accross the sky slightly above the treeline. The object(s) disapeared behind the trees extremly fast after appearing out of nowhere. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed.;38.6283;-121.3307
Saw three star-like objects moving through the sky.;2009-08-25 21:31:00;35 seconds;Saw three star-like objects moving through the sky. I was sitting on the roof of our eight foot tall shed with my brother. I saw what at first I thought to be three planes, two in the southeastern sky, and one in the southern sky. Then I noticed that they were brighter than usual. They were not blinking they were like stars but about two times bigger and brighter, and a more orange-yellow color than a star. They were moving east slowly in the sky. Two were moving at the same pace, but the third was slower and farther behind the others. After about 35 seconds the objects went behind a tree and did not reemerge. There was no sound whatsoever that we heard. I had never seen a UFO before and was not sure what to think of this. It wasn’t like any other aircraft I had ever seen before.;38.6283;-121.3307

I was sitting on the roof of my home looking at the stars for about an hour when my sister mentioned that she saw two moving stars up and behind me.  As I went to look at them, I saw for myself a very bright star shaped object in the southwestern sky, just above the tree line.  In my confirmed excitement, I turned to the objects she was pointing at, and noticed they were the same size and shape, but more of an orange color, while mine was white. The two were headed eastward and traveling much slower than any aircraft around here.  The two grouped together were staying the same distance apart the entire time and moving in the same direction.  I turned back around to look at the object I initially saw, and observed it gliding behind the tree line in a more southerly and downward direction, at the speed it was going, it should have reappeared within two or three seconds, but it never did.  When I turned again to see the pair of lights, they had already gone. The light I initially saw looked to be about the same shape and color of a star in the night sky.  To my best estimate, it was about 400 yards away and lower than the regular aircraft around here.  None of them illuminated the area around us from their light.  Their true speed I can’t say, but it felt to me they were going the speed of a slow helicopter. They were about the size in the sky as that of my thumbnail with my arm fully extended.;38.6283;-121.3307
It was a small, quiet, blinking object it's movements were very smooth, unlike a plane or a helicopter.;2017-12-19 03:00:00;1 minute;I have been seeing this object on and off since mid November. It was a small, quiet, blinking object it's movements were very smooth, unlike a plane or a helicopter.  It would move left and right, up and down, and sometimes be in the same place or move to another spot.  The color was white, and it looked like it was giving off what, I can best describe, as electricity.  When I first saw this object, I thought it was a drone, but it made no noise and, since it was a bit windy, it's movements were too smooth for it to have been a drone.  I woke up my husband to have him see what I was seeing - he is very logical and would tell me what he thought it was.  But, when he saw it, even he was astonished and unsure what it was. I stayed up all morning watching it, and as the sun was coming up, it stopped moving, almost like it was pretending to be a star.;38.6283;-121.3307
Faint light moving in the sky — a bit too bright and erratic to be a satellite.;2020-03-22 20:35:00;1;Faint light moving in the sky — a bit too bright and erratic to be a satellite. My husband and I were laying in bed, relaxing. I glanced out our bedroom window, looking out at the night sky. I was admiring the bright planet (Mercury?) and noticed what I thought was star.  It was stable at first, but then it started to move slowly.  I told my husband to look and see what I was seeing — which he confirmed it was moving.  It made no sound and it had a faint glow it made no noise.  Then, it started to fade in and out, but in slightly different positions my husband says it looked like it was circling, almost spiraling up.  Then it faded away completely.;38.6283;-121.3307

It was flying directly towards me at about 1500 feet.  I’m a (drone pilot) so that’s a pretty good guess on altitude.  The light went out and there was nothing there, No strobes, no craft, nothing.  Incidentally in correlation my phone, iPad, music speaker all powered down.  Probably my 8th sighting through out my life.;38.6283;-121.3307
