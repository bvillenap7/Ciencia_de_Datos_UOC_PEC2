Box shaped object spinning on corner changing colors while reflecting sunlight;2005-07-11 16:30:00;3 minutes;Box shaped object spinning on corner changing colors while reflecting sunlight On July 11, 2005 I was on my porch which faces east. At approximately 4:30 in the afternoon I looked to my left (north) and noticed an object that looked like a box that was turned on its corner and was rotating at a fast speed on that corner. It changed colors as the sun glistened off of its surface. I estimate that the object was half a mile away. It looked to be about one hundred feet in the air.  I thought the object might be a balloon or a kite but the prevailing winds were from the west and the object was moving west. As the object moved to the west it remained level in flight and it neither rose or lowered in elevation.  I watched the object for about three minutes and decided to go inside to get my binoculars. When I had returned to the patio the object was gone.;38.6283;-121.3307
