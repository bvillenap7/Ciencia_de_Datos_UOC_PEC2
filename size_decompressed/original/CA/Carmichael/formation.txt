Orb triangle formation at sundown.;2013-02-28 18:00:00;90 seconds;Orb triangle formation at sundown As the sun was setting, 3 lights appeared in the sky, as if out of nowhere.  At first glance they looked like helicopters.  One light went out, then another, you could not see a plane or helicopter behind it (I.e. a helicopter turns its light off and you can see it clear as day).  There was no noise that we heard, and it was moving slow, but fast enough that we could see it moving.;38.6283;-121.3307
Massive High Altitude Red/White Blinking Light 'V' Formation over Carmichael, CA.;2013-09-22 23:30:00;3 minutes;Massive High Altitude Red/White Blinking Light 'V' Formation over Carmichael CA I have  lived in my neighborhood for over 30 years and while I am a full believer I have never had a UFO sighting until the night in question.  I live on the outskirts of a large residential area laid out around the base of Barrett Hill in Northern California.  At the top of Barrett Hill is the Jr. high School that I attended over 25 years ago.  The top of Barrett Hill offers a near 360 degree view of the night sky and is often my favorite spot to watch the Perseid Meteor Showers.  My sighting occurred around 11:30 pm as I stopped to have a smoke on my way home from a grocery run.  I had parked my car in the middle school parking lot and stepped out to have a cigarette.  As I was leaning against my car and gazing up at the night sky I became aware of motion and blinking lights about 3/4 of the way up from the horizon. I observed 8 to 10 alternating red/white blinking lights in a 'V' formation moving at a slow but steady pace across almost 3/4 of my viewing angle of the night sky.  I have witnessed many aircraft lights as they travel at nearly 37,000 feet and also satellites as they travel above 160km as a reference.  This 'V' formation seemed to be flying MUCH higher than a commercial jet and must have been utterly massive.  I'm ended up walking from my car about 200 feet to the back of the school following the giant 'V' formation until it travelled silently out of my view.  The total sighting lasted about 2:45 seconds.  Being an avid Coast to Coast listener my first guess as to the identity of the craft or crafts might be a fleet of autonomous high altitude lighter than air vehicles or black triangles.  I hope this account serves as one of many pieces of the puzzle that will eventually lead to 'Full Disclosure'.;38.6283;-121.3307
