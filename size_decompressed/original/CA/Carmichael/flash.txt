It was a very small light could be compared with aircraft or star. This light flashed continuosly almost with a morse like code.with colorsgreen/blue, red and white! atleast three colors would flash maybe a second apart and not coming from the same position(side by side)it was. object appeared to be coming closer but never really did for a better descrption. It seemed to just come forward than back and move very slightly up and down or from side to side. Very hard to notice unless focused very well on positions of flashes of light ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius.  PD));38.6283;-121.3307
