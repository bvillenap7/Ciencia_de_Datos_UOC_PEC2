Low flying large darkened triangle with no sound seen by nine policemen;1978-03-04 22:00:00;10 minutes;Low flying large darkened triangle with no sound seen by nine policemen I was a police officer in my small town.  A group of us from the same Department were on a recreational basketball team that played in the evenings.  As we stood in the parking lot on a very cold night, talking, all 9 of us saw:  Approaching from the South, an area of sky that was dark, meaning the stars were covered by an object.  It was low in the sky, moving very slowly.  As it came closer we could all see it was a huge triangular shaped object, wider than it was long, similar to a B-2 bomber, but much larger.  I estimate it was at least 100 yards from wing tip to wing tip, and about 25 yards long.  There was no light of any type, just the obvious blotting out of the night sky, which was full of stars in our small town.  As it came directly overhead, and slightly East of our location, the most blatant thing that stood out was the lack of any sound from the object.  I estimate its altitude at 500-1000 ft.  Even as it slowly passed, and continued north, there was no sound at all, and no lights.  While we had barely said a word while it was in sight, we all started talking about it, comparing details.  We all agreed that, due to the very slow speed, and lack of sound at its low height, that it was not an aircraft.   (Our small town was on Victor 32, an airliner freeway from California to Seattle, and we had all seen and heard a lot of aircraft before.)  As we were all cops, we more or less agreed to not talk about, for fear of being ridiculed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.7206;-122.6376
