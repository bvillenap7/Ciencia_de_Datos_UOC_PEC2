At about 22:41 I was looking westward from my car on a street in Yreka.  Above the hill that borders the town to the west I saw an extrememly bright spherical object travel very rapidly across the sky in a gentle arc, and disappear behind that hill.  The object appeared to be about half the size of my fist when held out at arms length, and was surrounded by a larger haze, making the exact determination of the shape difficult.  Shortly after seeing this, I yelled to two of my friends who were about 10 yards away.  They had not seen the object, but as I was telling them to look to the west, the three of us saw the event repeat itself, nearly exactly the same as before.  The dual nature of this event makes me suspicious of what I would have otherwise regarded as a rather spectacular meteorite...;41.7206;-122.6376
