The object was round and red to orange with the brightness of a system light. I was looking up scanning around the north west to east watching all the fireworks go off in the sky when I saw the light drifting towards my house, it was as big as are street lights I started yelling at it and myself and running back and fourth about 150 ft to get a side view it had no flashing lights fire works were going off on both sides of my block. I could not believe it ,my eyes got teary, then it went up and got smaller and headed away north and slightly east faster than it was drifting but not as fast as the space station or as straight looking ,it disappeared and repapered twice before it was out of sight way up and out their . I really thought military flare or chopper but no way could it have been, I am so relived to hear I am not alone in this observation.;38.6881;-121.4474
