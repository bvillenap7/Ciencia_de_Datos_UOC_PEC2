PD));2008-11-02 10:45:00;all night;13 different flashing lights surrounding my house for the past month i was sitting outside of my house at around 10:45 pm and noticed a flashing light not much bigger than a star but noticablly brighter. as i looked at it i noticed that it was flashing from red to green to white and repeated.  it was then that i noticed there were several others, 12 that i could count, surrounding my house just a little dimmer than the first one i saw. ive seen them every night since then.  its kinda scary, but at the same time its really fascinating ((NUFORC Note:  Stars or planets??

4 hovering lights at very low altitude South of Marysville;2012-04-08 20:35:00;45 seconds;4 hovering lights at very low altitude South of Marysville My husband and I, along with our 3 children, were traveling South on Hwy 70. It was approximately 8:35 P.M. and we were about 2 miles south of Marysville. Suddenly we saw 4 lights in the sky right in view of our windshield. They appeared to be between 150 and 200 feet above ground.  They were in a straight line formation laterally, 4 across. There were absolutely no blinking lights and there were no discernable shapes that we could see surrounding the lights. 	As we moved South, the objects were moving North/East and they were passing us on our left side. My husband pulled over and I got out of the truck to better observe them. He remained in the truck and rolled down his window. 	As I got out and stood beside our truck I observed the 4 objects hovering on the other side of the highway. There was absolutely no noise coming from them. Even out of the truck I could not hear anything coming from the objects. They remained at the same altitude of about 150 to 200 feet above ground, although now they were a little further away (North East of where we were). At that point they broke formation, so that they were no longer in a straight lateral line. Some were higher and others were lower. Then 1 by 1 they blinked out of existence. They were gone. 	It all happened rather quickly, but 45 seconds was long enough to make those observations. It was very fascinating and at no point felt threatened or scared. 	In no way am I an expert in aircraft, but I have seen plenty of aircraft in my lifetime. My father was in the Airforce. I have been on military bases, I have been to numerous air shows. I am well aware of the appearance and behaviors of planes and helicopters. I also crew for a hot air balloon pilot. I often observe the skies. My husband was in the Navy and lived on an aircraft carrier. We can tell you that whatever we saw was not something that we could identify.;39.1667;-121.5048
Orbital Light moving in unusual pattern;2012-04-22 22:20:00;1 Minute;Orbital Light moving in unusual pattern I was standing outside around 10:20pm on the night of April 22, 2012 looking to see if any meteor activity was visible.  I live in an urban area so only bright stars are usually visible through the street light pollution.  I noticed what appeared to be a satellite to the west at about 45 degrees off the horizon and above the trees moving in a south by south west direction and continued to follow it.   About 15 seconds into its movement it seemed to make a short burst of speed and move erratically which made me think my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Then the object began to turn in a easterly direction and finally continued on a straight course to the North East for about 20 seconds, then flashed brightly green and vanished from my vision.  I did not see ant streak or trail indicating it has sped off, it just vanished.;39.1667;-121.5048
