Cluster of stars moving through the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space X satellites?  PD));2019-05-25 01:00:00;5 minutes;Saw what looked like a meteor streak in the sky on a clear night, looked closer to realize it was a cluster of stars moving through the sky.  It looked like 100 stars clustered together moving as one object in a line.  Me and 3 others stood there in awe as it made its way behind the mountains.  It was the craziest thing Iâ€™ve ever seen.   It was also by Beale Air Force base. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites?  PD));39.1667;-121.5048
