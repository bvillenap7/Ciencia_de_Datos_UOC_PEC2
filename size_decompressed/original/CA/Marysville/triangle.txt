I got up beacuse I could not sleep. I got a smoke and went outside in the back yard and grabd a patio chair and moved it out on to the grass so I could look at the sky. It was real clear with no clouds. I sat down and leaned back and looked up. I saw a couple planes flying north. But a few seconds later three lights caught my eye off to the south moving northeast. First I thought they might be planes, but they had no blinking lights. They had solid lights. There was no fancy pulsing or anything. But they would move as a group and they suddenly did a sharp turn and went east. Not an arcing turn but like on the dot change direction. They flew past my line of sight. BEAL Airforce base is around 8 miles east of where I live. After a few more moments looking at the sky a Jet flew in a wide circle. From the speed that it was moving I made it out to be a Air Force jet. I dont know what the three triagles were. But I have never seen anything like it before or move like it. My wife told me about this site. so here I am;39.1667;-121.5048
