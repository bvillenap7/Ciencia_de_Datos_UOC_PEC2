UFO  seen during funnel cloud storm at BEALE AFB in daytime.;2019-09-16 02:00:00;1-2 minutes;UFO  seen during funnel cloud storm at BEALE afb in daytime Lots of funnel clouds in the sky, spotted maybe 5 of them.  As I was looking at these I noticed a black blobdot in the sky.  It wasnt moving then I recorded and as I was recording it moved a little then either disappeared or took off real fast.  There was a plane circling the funnel clouds and this thing so I figured it was a weather tech of some kind.  Showed my husband who said it could be that too.  I keep thinking it's a bird, but filmed birds the next day and you can clearly see their wings.  And the biggest bird we have hear is a hawk. That thing was high up and huge.  Also didnt flutter like birds do on film.  We were on the west border entry of BEALE AFB and we see lights and night time craft, frequently.  Not me, but my friends and husband.  Nobody has seen a daytime one like this.  Tried to upload this video on mufon but it didnt let me probably because my cell service.  So here's a link  https://youtu.be/C1FUd4hhNrk;39.1667;-121.5048
