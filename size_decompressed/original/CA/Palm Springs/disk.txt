Lost four to five hours;1986-04-10 12:00:00;fifteen minutes;Lost four to five hours Not sure of year, as so long ago, but was Spring--around 1984 to 87. My brother, his wife and my now ex-wife were driving across the desert from Las Vegas to Palm Springs early morning and encountered a huge craft hovering fifty feet off the desert. Our wifes were screaming and locked the doors, but then everything gets fragmented after that.. We do remember watching it later- way up in the sky, pulsating off and on and zipping back and forth across the sky between the mountains- off in the distance. It zipped out into the middle of the sky waited a few seconds and zipped away, just as a jet zoomed by where it was a few seconds before... We were all very upset, confused, dazed and stopped at the first pay phone. My brother and I had a hard time getting both of us into the booth and getting the door closed to get the light on so we could read the phone book.(too scared to actually complete call).. We later freaked out when we were unpacking at the first motel, when we realized that we had left early so we could have lunch in Palm Springs-----so it shouldn't have been dark... Fragmented memories of more and fear ever since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838

I saw a bright object in the western sky over the San Jacinto Mts. shoot a colored orb from its body.;2004-07-28 05:00:00;1 hour;I saw a bright object in the western sky over the San Jacinto Mts. shoot a colored orb from its body. This is my second report to your center and it is not an isolated siting for me.  I awoke at 5:00 am on Wednesday, July 29, 2004.  I observed the large bright orb in the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains that I have been observing over the past several days.  It only appears sometime between 3:00 and 5:00 am.  (I get up frequently throughout the night and I always look to see if it is there and it never is in site before 3:00 am.)At this time I also observed 2 colored orbs that pulsated colors of green, red, and blue.  They were very visable through  my binoculars and they appeared to be circular or saucer shape.  I lowered my binoculars and watched the sky, from the bright light orb shot a colored orb.  I woke up my husband, who isn't as absorbed in these sitings as I am, after I saw the colored orb shoot from the bright object, he came and looked through the binoculars and saw the colored orbs as well.  I continued to watch the sky and as I did, 3 more orbs approached (smaller than the two already in sight) and lined up vertically between the two larger colored orbs.  As I watched, the large white orb slowly ascended higher into the sky as well as the colored orbs.  I know they are ascending slowly because the mountains are my scale, they appear initially just over the mountain and as the hour goes by, they slowly ascend upwards until they disappear into the sky.  I think that what I am witnessing is very unusual and warrents further investigation from someone.  Will someone please get a hold of me?  The other part of this sighting is the bright light orb that appears in the western sky over the San Jacinto Mountains in the evening prior to the morning that it appears over the mountains in the eastern.  It always begins to appear around 8-8:30 pm and slowly desends over the mountain until it disappears behind the mountain range.  It takes about an hour for it to descend and dip below the range of my view. (The last report that I submitted I mentioned the Santa Rosa Mountains, my husband corrected me indicating that it is all the San Jacinto Mountain range that encompasses the valley where we live.)  My husband observes the bright object as well and agrees that it is very unusual and it does move slowly.  What the heck am I witnessing?????  I do not have the proper equipment to record my sightings, however, you are welcome to come and set up shop at my home so that you can record it.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838

They were flying about 1000 to 2000 feet above ground. i watched them until they vanished. all four were heading south. this was my first time seeing something like this. i now know we are not alone.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
