REPORT for UFO CENTER:  written on May 21, 2008. On the door step of my San Diego hotel room the morning of March 26, 1997 the newspaper headline showed a grim photo:  Heaven’s Gate members lying neatly dead with black plastic bags over their heads.  They believed they were going to meet the spaceship behind Hale Bopp to go to a UFO. That was the joking talk among my group at breakfast.  I knew the day would end much more pleasantly. That late afternoon, back home in Palm Springs, I welcomed several friends, armed with binoculars and telescopes, all come to comet-watch from my front lawn, which faces West, the direction the Comet would be visibly arcing over shortly. Wine was served and each staked out a spot.  I chose a spot on my outdoor-living room wall, facing the foothills of the mountains directly in front of my house.  Soon, just before twilight, the first lights of the comet, coming from the north west were visible.   Everyone made trips inside for snacks and drinks and chatter  until darkness began to fall.  The night was very still and clear and dark, and the lights from the arcing comet were spectacular.  Several of the group,  once they saw the comet,  had enough of that and were gathered in the living room enjoying each other’s company and the wine.  I stayed at my post as, from my point of view,  it was too wonderful to miss a moment of. Leaning my elbows on the wall, I was very comfortably watching the show with my binoculars.  I did notice that directly in front of me there were two very bright  unblinking “stars”, just over the top of the foothills, it seemed: (it was by now quite dark, so I surmised they were right over the top of the foothills.)  Suddenly about 45 minutes  into watching the comet arc ever closer to the front of my house, (probably about 7 or 7:30 PM) , just as Hale-Bopp was almost directly overhead. The two “stars”  shot forward, like blazing headlights, straight toward me. Startled, I almost dropped my binoculars.  But I no longer needed them as these objects were so bright as to be blinding.  They looked like the headlights of the largest vehicle ever and they zoomed toward me.  Just as I knew they would crash into me and my house, they just as swiftly in concert zoomed to my right,( north)  toward Hale-Bopp.  When I say zoomed, these lights moved with  swiftness and with a smoothness of flight I had never imagined possible.  Obviously what I had thought to be “stars” was one object.  The two lights sailed in perfect concert  directly toward the comet, and seemed to disappear behind it, in moments going so fast and so far they became invisible in the light of the comet. I ran inside to see who else had seen it , but everyone else had been inside. I was later told  that some of my neighbors down the street saw it, and that there was something in the next day’s Palm Springs newspapers.  I did not see the articles. Perhaps the members of Heaven’s Gate were in that “spaceship” behind the comet, and just maybe they got to the anticipated UFO they sought?  I do hope so for them. But that was not the only experience with strange phenomenon here in these mountains and foothills.  About a year ago, in the fall of 2007, Palm Springs experienced a night of thunderstorms.  The foothills and mountains were covered in clouds and thunder rumbled all night.  About 3 AM the noise woke me, and going into my all-glass living room, I looked up at the mountains in front of me.  I was astonished to see four huge squares of bright lights.  I would estimate that given the distance from me the largest one was about 50’ square, and the smaller two were about 30 ‘ square.  Each had a spectacular whiteness but while they were extraordinarily bright they were not shining the light anywhere.  They were like beacons.  And they were moving.  They were not stationary.  I could not imagine how people could possibly be way up there in those rocky  foothill-mountains, and moving those huge lights about. It just would not be possible to stand up there in the darkness and move those lights about.  I stared at this phenomenon for about fifteen minutes, mesmerized.  I hesitated to call the police.   I kept thinking perhaps the police were doing this!  (Now that’s crazy sounding , I know, but that is what I was thinking.)  Just as I had decided to call someone, the  lights just went out.  One minute they were there.  Then they were out.  Nothing sped away.  They just went out.  The next day I searched with binoculars that area and knew that it would have been impossible for people to be walking and standing in those areas, way at the top of those mountains.  And no way they could have in the dark held and moved those lights. But where did they go?  What were they? And a third occurrence  in these mountains. One day I was driving home from the Palm Springs airport, traveling west on Tahquitz.  At one point I happened to look up, and there over the top of the mountains at the end of that street, was an enormous blimp-like object, just hovering there.  It did not move while I was looking.  At the next stop light I noticed it had moved slightly forward but not much.   I could not see any windows or anything distinguishing about it, as it was very far from me at that point.  But I could see that it was gigantic in size, nothing like the blimps we see advertising things from time to time.  This thing would have fit five or six of such blimps into it.  Again I notice the huge thing move slightly backward.  I called Le Vallauris restaurant, as it seemed to be directly over the area where they are located.  But lunch service was on and the secretary in the office was out to lunch.  I drove as fast as I could trying to get to the end of the road to have a good look at it.  When suddenly it just disappeared.  Gone.  No sign of it anywhere. Obviously these three occurrences are connected in that they all happened in the same location.  Yet they all appear to be totally different one from the other.  What can any of them have been?  Not one ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

A UFO was erratically flying in the sky circling an object, when it shot a light and destroyed the object.;1997-08-03 21:15:00;10 minutes;A UFO was erratically flying in the sky circling an object, when it shot a light and destroyed the object. I was walking to the pool area, and I had bug repellent on.  I sat down in a chair, and looked up.  I was looking at the stars, but two stars imparticular.  At first, I thought it was an airplane, but it was moving so erratically, that no airplane could move like that.  I just watched it circle this one star, and then, I saw a faint yellow flash out of the circling (not circled) UFO, and there was a clear enough flash that it lit up a portion of the sky, and the circled star disappeared.  Then I saw a blue vortex-ish shape near the remaining UFO, and I saw the UFO head toward the vortex and it too disappeared with the vortex.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
The sphere of light was silent and being followed by a helicopter with no visable lights.;2003-02-25 19:48:00;38 seconds;The sphere of light was silent and being followed by a helicopter with no visable lights. From inside my home, I heard the sound of a low flying helicopter coming towards the house. I went outside onto my front lawn and when I looked up I saw a globe of light traveling at a moderate speed with no sound emiting from it and a helicopter with no lights(could see its sillouet) following it at the same speed approximatly 300 yards behind it. They were both heading south across the mountainside at approximatly 250 to 300 feet in elevation. I watched them both till they were out of eyes range.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Strange lights over Palm Springs, CA;2004-03-25 23:30:00;5 seconds;Strange lights over Palm Springs, CA My wife and I were on vacation in Palm Springs two weeks ago. When walking back to the hotel from dinner with two friends from Switzerland that we met at our hotel, the four of us stopped to admire the night sky, so clear in the desert air. As we looked up, our eyes were drawn to motion. Four or five lights, indistinguisable from stars, suddenly moved very quickly in separate curvilinear paths and disappeared. It was a few seconds of motion in total, directly overhead. One in our group said aloud 'um, did you see that?' We all had.  Whereas I've seen metorites in the past, they've all featured tails as they burned and broke up in the atmoshpere. These lights did not - they simply were dots of light that moved extremely fast and disappeared. This, I cannot explain.  Sighting occured near the corner of W. Arenas and S. Cahuilla in downtown Palm Springs. It's been on my mind ever since so I figured I should search out a registry and report it.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
UFO  over Palm Springs  Metallic object sighted west of Pam Springs, CA around 11:40am on Sunday April 21st. Object was stationary over;2013-04-21 11:40:00;30 minutes;UFO  over Palm Springs  Metallic object sighted west of Pam Springs, CA around 11:40am on Sunday April 21st.  Object was stationary over the mountains at a high altitude and appeared to have other metallic objects surrounding it, almost like a swarm.  The object maintained altitude and position for 10 minutes or so before drifting to the North West over the next 20 minutes where I lost sight of it.  I describe the object as metallic only because it reflected sunlight. I was barely able to see these reflections without polarized glasses.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838

One and a half miles away.  Mountain, two miles high.  Moved in formation, up mountain into sky.  Created a V then shifted down into an introverted L.  Afterward 4 more lights moved at a rather constant rate up the mountain face and about 400 meters into the sky.  I have video.  We get ALOT of air craft here, chopper and plane.  These are something different, terrestrial or not.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Dancing lighthouse beacon pulsing randomly over east Coachella Valley;2017-10-21 19:52:00;5 minutes;Dancing lighthouse beacon pulsing randomly over east Coachella Valley At roughly 7:52PM October 21st, 2017, Laying on my back, stargazing from my backyard, facing west, I saw in the corner of my eye a quick flash.  It has the intensity of a meteor burning up, but when I quickly focused in on where it was, I couldn't see the typical meteor-trail.  Maybe it was a supernova?  But then another flash occurred a short distance away, bright with the intensity of plasma or phosphorous.  This time as its flash died down I could see the faint glow or an object moving as if being blown, or floating in the wind.  It can only be described as an orb maybe no bigger than a car or a basketball and moving about at a passenger planes cruising altitude.  From my vantage point it appeared directly above Redlands or Yucaipa and pulsed a brilliant white at random intervals, staying on for 1-4 seconds then going faint for 5-20 seconds, appearing much like a wandering satellite.  However, this was no satellite or plane as they fly over constantly and are easy to spot because of either indicator light! s (planes) or a uni-directional flight path (satellite).  The objects meandered, pulsing, performing figure-8's while moving from the west to the northeast of the sky, fading out of view over Joshua Tree.  It can be described as a floating light beacon of a lighthouse, its flash extremely bright, then fading out, but at intermittent cycles. My reaction was shock, fear, confusion and euphoria as I found myself waving to it or trying to perceive any kind of communication mentally or physically.  My intuition tells me that the object knew of its visibility, and that its whirling flight path, purposeful.  Dogs barking unusually, too.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
