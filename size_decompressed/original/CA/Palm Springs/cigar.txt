Cigar shaped craft in high heavens bewilders mother and son.;1997-08-24 18:00:00;10 seconds;Cigar shaped craft in high heavens bewilders mother and son. My mom and I were watching my younger brother's soccer game when somehow we both looked up toward the sky at the same time and saw a cigar shaped brown object moving slowly through the sky at the cruising altitude of an airplane.  Staring at it for a few seconds, we noticed an undulating heat wavelike emanating from it.  One second, it would have appeared to be straight but then began to enter the wavelike stage.  Then a soccer ball flew between our heads and I ran to pick it up.  Then, after only about five seconds of not looking at it, I turned my head toward the same place and it was gone.  No military aircraft or device of this earth could have been traveling so slowly and then accelerated to a speed so quickly that it could have disappeared from the heavens.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
another craft sighting near the san jacinto mountains in california.;2009-04-25 01:30:00;15 seconds;another craft sighting near the san jacinto mountains in california. i went outside last night for a smoke on to my patio. it was close to 1:30 am, i was looking towards the hillside of the San Jacinto mountains. i live across the street, so i am very close. Anyway, i saw this thing fly by. it moved in a straight line and was going very swiftly though the air. it was about the size of a city bus, long and narrow. i could not make out to much other detail, but the street lights did refect off the underside. it was traveling from north to south. it made no sound and there were no flashing lights on the craft. This is the second time in past few months that i have seen something strange in the skies above palm springs. the last time, i saw 4 round flying discs. they flew over head, no lights, no sounds, heading north to south, and it was obvious each craft was being independly  piloted by the way they were moving through the air.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
