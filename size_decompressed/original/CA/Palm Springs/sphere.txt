Sky is very clear in the desert - no lights near because we are in the north part of town. Looking up at the stars I suddenly saw two lights moving very very high up, from west to east.  I said to my partner to look at the lights and she saw them as well - no form discernible.  It was the fastest thing I had ever seen (I was an Air Force brat and have been around planes since I was a kid).  We followed the lights to the east when they made a very sudden ZIG ZAG and disappeared.  I timed this afterwards by counting the time it took for me to move my head to see this - it was seven (7) seconds, and then it was gone. We rose early in the morning of Sunday January 30, 2000 about 5.15 am PST to see the last quarter of the moon and how close Venus was to it. Our property is in the north part of the city of Palm Springs - higher than the town itself, so there isn't light reflection from the city.  My partner went outside on to the patio and turned all the lights off.  After looking at the moon we then tilted our heads to look at the stars in the clear desert sky -it was exceptionally clear.  As I looked back to the east I saw two lights, very very high, moving very very fast and said to my partner - look at those lights, what's that?  The lights moved eastward and then after a few (maybe 5 seconds)seconds, zig zagged sharply to the left and then disappeared.  I was very careful to note the time and then timed the incident again by moving my head (I'd previously timed it by saying one and two and - to get the seconds count.  I subsequently (during the day I timed a jet) and found that the jet was 5 times slower than what we had seen.  The lights moved together they were tiny, almost pinpoint but the lights themselves were really bright even though small.  There was just one object even although we couldn't see any form. This incident took place at our weekend home in Palm Springs, CA.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Multiple sightings of groups of small reflective silver spheres.;2003-05-03 16:00:00;5 min;Multiple sightings of groups of small reflective silver spheres. This is the third time I have seen these objects. I live in Palm Springs near the airport. Last summer while out for an afternoon walk, I glanced at the sky and saw a group of at least 50 silver spheres slowly moving across the valley from the southeast toward the northwest. At first I thought they were birds but they were spread out in strings and groupings. Some would break away and then circle back. I watched until I could no longer see them and decided they must be mylar balloons that had broken loose and were floating on the air current. Two weeks ago at work near College of the Desert, I looked up and saw the same objects - maybe 20 or 30 traveling in the same direction as before. I watched as they slowly moved across the sky and observed that some seemed to be tethered together in a line which would make a circle and then open up again. They were all in a group but very stretched out. Today while getting my mail, I looked up and saw them again. At first only one, then briefly a very small group clustered together. This group turned in unison, flashed in the sun, and disappeared. Birds, I thought. Just then a commercial jet which had just taken off proceeded from west to east. A single small, very silver orb paced the plane at exactly the same speed at what seemed to be 100 yards distance from the right wing. Definitely not a bird. I watched as it paced the plane for approximately one minute. The plane headed northeast and the sphere then went east and I lost it. I looked again before entering my house and spotted it due east about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was still and looked like a bright star. I watched it for another minute and then went inside. I am curious as to what is going on.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Sphere paces airliner.;2003-05-03 16:00:00;1-2 min;Sphere paces airliner. Re: the O'Hare Airport incident 10-06. This object sounds almost identical to the round metallic sphere I saw pacing a plane that had just taken off from the Palm Springs airport on 5-3-03. My report is on file.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
At least 3 bright lights in sky over Palm Springs moving north to south.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2017-12-22 17:31:00;5 minutes;At least 3 bright lights in sky over Palm Springs moving north to south Just watched several lights in the sky over Palm Springs, CA, moving north to south.  Two very bright lights, each with splay of light behind.  At one point a smaller light shot straight up into the sky after the two other lights went past it.  One large light continued on until it disappeared over mountains. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
