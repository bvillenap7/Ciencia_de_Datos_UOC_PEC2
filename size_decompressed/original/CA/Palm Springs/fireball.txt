Brilliant Green Fireball moves slowly from high in the SE to low in the SW;2000-09-26 20:13:00;4 seconds;Brilliant Green Fireball moves slowly from high in the SE to low in the SW I have often heard you talk about brilliant green flashes of light seen in the sky. Tonight I saw mine! at 8:13pm Pacific... it moved for about 4 seconds from high in the south east to low in the southwest... I'm in Palm Springs looking out my office window facing south... Very big... about half the size of a full moon... or just hold you thumb out in front of you... it was at least as big as your thumbnail. Brilliant lime green color... breaking apart as it moved across and down... leaving little miniature versions of itself in it's wake turning yellow then red and orange. The tail was long... about the length of your index finger stretched out in front of you. I watched it disappear behind the Horizon to the west... which here in Palm Springs is the San Jacinto Mountains... to the west.  Very spectacular... thought you might want to compare with other sightings.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838

Fireball or meteor breaking up over Palm Springs.  ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.  PD));2015-12-22 18:15:00;3-8 minutes;Fireball or meteor breaking up over Palm Springs. I was in the car and I saw what looked like a meteor burning up and breaking up over the Palm Springs Airport.  It burned for at least 3 minutes, then broke up into a few pieces.  Those pieces disappeared for about 1 minute, then reappeared further away.  About 1 minute after that, the entire thing disappeared.  The trail changed colors, as if it was burning different gases or something. ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.  PD));33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Large shooting star spotted due north of Palm Springs, CA;2018-09-11 02:38:00;00:00:05;Large shooting star spotted due north of Palm Springs, CA Shortly after 2:30 this morning, I looked up into the sky directly to the North and saw a flash or what i thought was a shooting star. Perhaps it was a comet because it looked so big (approximately 3 inches long from my perception.  It was a third wide as its length.  It disappeared as soon as it was visible. Recently, there were shooting stars so thought maybe it was related.  I waited several minutes to see if there would be others but nothing was happening.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Bright orange light appeared in the sky and quickly descended towards the earth in a straight line.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-11 01:50:00;1-2 seconds;Bright orange light appeared in the sky and quickly descended towards the earth in a straight line. I saw a bright orange light appear in the sky, quickly descend towards the earth in a straight line and vanish before reaching the earth’s surface.  The object was circular and the size of a dime.  While it was in the distance, I could tell the flying object was in Earth’s stratosphere. It appeared the UFO was 20-30km from the ground and exploring the mountains in Palm Springs.  I was staying at Sparrow’s Lodge (E Palm Canyon Drive) and was facing South/South-West at the time of the sighting. To me, the most bizarre thing about the sighting was that the UFO was moving quickly towards the earth.  I suppose I always imagined UFO’s beaming back to space, not towards us.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Orange glowing lights moving in the sky;2020-02-01 22:45:00;4-5 minutes;Orange glowing lights moving in the sky Cans out to walk dog and saw 2 orange glowing lights moving west to East followed by 2 more.  I heard no sounds of aircraft.  They seemed low as the lights were bright orange.  Thought a helicopter at first but never saw a clear orange color.  As someone mentioned on 1/28/20, the lights then seemed to ascend up to higher altitudes and then disappear.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
