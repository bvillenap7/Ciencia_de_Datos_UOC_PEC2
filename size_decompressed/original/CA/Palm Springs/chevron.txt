Dark, unlit, wing-shaped UFO flew over Palm Springs - NNW to SSE - 12:05 am 9/26/05;2005-09-26 00:05:00;1 minute;Dark, unlit, wing-shaped UFO flew over Palm Springs - NNW to SSE - 12:05 am 9/26/05 12:05 just after midnight. I went in my backyard, it was very dark, I got into the spa, sat back and looked up. I was facing NNE. Cassiopeia was in my field of vision. A faint lighted area caught my eye and I watched it move across the sky. It was not a bank of lights but like a vehicle without its lights on. The moon (sliver) was rising in the east and could have been reflecting off it. Or the lights of the city beneath. I thought it was a group of birds but it didn't change configuration like a group of flying birds would do. As I have seen them do before. I thought to myself, 'I'm seeing a UFO.' I could not continuously look directly at it because it was too dark. I looked around it more often, to see it better, as it went over. I could definitely see that it was wing-shaped and looked like there were end structures (see the graphic I include with this: pswing.jpg) I started seeing it when it was passing Cassiopeia and it faded away (at about 50 degrees up in the sky.) It travelled from NNW to SSE. Made no sound. Was the only one I saw.  About fifteen minutes later I saw what looked like a meteor fly UP in the north but it left no trail light. Just started and stopped quickly. By up, I mean it went from closer to the horizon, up towards the center of the sky. It looked like a small light encircled by another light.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
