Quickly realizing it was too large it began to grow in front of my eyes.  It started turning and grew to at least 20 ft across as it grew I could see a structure through the material.  The internal structure resembled a birds wing bones.  It became solid and then as it was gliding up the mountainside two concentric rings were visible the inside bubble looked like it held some kind of vapor the outside was a ring of blue as bright as neon.  It pulsed and went straight up into the sky pulsed again and  again and was only a black dot that disappeared.  Immediately, I noticed flashes of lights to my left and then to my right, it was as if flashbulbs were going off all over the sky.  I drew several pictures of the craft as soon as I came back inside.  I has called my mother to view the structure but she did not get there in time.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Inexplicable red UFO rises like a distant star, then falls to earth.;2012-11-22 07:15:00;5 minutes;Inexplicable red UFO rises like a distant star, then falls to earth. The first thing we saw was what looked like a distant star, except that it was glowing red.  It was travelling slowly, horizontally....   But then it paused and shot straight up until it looked like a really distant star.  It was still red, but then it began an erratic zigzag pattern.   Suddenly it began to glow brighter and it seemed to diffuse.   The image became bigger and redder and began to slowly descend, becoming more and more diffused, and, therefore, larger.    It actually looked like it had fallen to earth.  Like something that had silently exploded and fallen to earth like confetti.   It was simply beyond belief.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838

To naked eye, it looked like a stick figure of a five pointed star We had come back from dinner, and I noticed a 5 point stick figure star over the San Jacinto Mountains.  When we got in, I went into the back yard with my ipad and started filming it.  It just looked like a bright light that changed in its brilliance.  My husband came out with his canon hd vixia HFM31 camera, and started filming it. The object did not move, as in the video.  That was his movement.  He had it on zoom and did not alter the setting. The object seemed to come closer and retreat.  You can see on the video, the shape and changing shape and color of it.  When he went inside, several minutes later, I observed it to just disappear.  It did not fly off.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
