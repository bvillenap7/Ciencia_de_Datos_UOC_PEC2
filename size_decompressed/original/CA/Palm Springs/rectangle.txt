WE (four) were in the pool in a downtown private resort in Palm Springs on 01/08/06 at 22:00 approx. I noticed a large rectangular object moving (length-wise)from south to north. The other 3 persons also at that moment seen and observed it. It was about 2000 ft./2500 ft. approx. in altitude and appeared to be 30 feet in width and 90 feet in length. The duration of travel was around 22 seconds and then we lost sight due to tree line and buildings. None of us know what it could have been, and even though it was quite a phenomenal sight, none off us think of it much, consciously or subconsciously.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838

Roughly 1/5 of the way up the silhouette of Mount San Jasinto was 8 red lights above a blue line followed by another 8 red lights.  All 3 sets of lights were parallel and evening spaced apart.   Object was about 3 miles away and would guess it was 100' wide x 50' high.  Moved slow around Canyon Ridge towards the bottom tram station.  Then disappeared.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
