Round craft with pulsing white lights around the perimeter, treetop level right ahead of my car!;2004-08-06 02:30:00;20 minutes;Round craft with pulsing white lights around the perimeter, treetop level right ahead of my car! I was returning home about 2:30 a.m.  I was driving east on Ramon Road.  At Avenida Cabelleros, I looked ahead and saw a round craft with pulsing white lights around the perimeter, about treetop level above the street about four blocks ahead of me.  I noticed that there were no other cars on Ramon at that time.  I became afraid, and I quickly turned into the Ramon Park, went inside my house and woke my husband up, and we both went outside and watched the object in the sky further east and higher up now.

I SWERVED LEFT AND RIGHT THEN GOT TO A SAFE SPOT AND GOT OUT OF THE CAR. I WANTED TO SEE IF THE AIRPLANE HAD CRASHED INTO THE NEARBY BUILDINGS. NOTHING HAPPEND. IT DISAPPEARED. MY FRIEND ASKED ME IF I WAS O.K. AND I ASKED HER IF SHE HAD SEEN WHAT HAPPEND OR THE OBJECT AND SHE SAID NO.

Moving star over Palm Springs, California, approximately 2300, November 11,2007;2007-11-12 23:00:00;:10;Moving star over Palm Springs, California, approximately 2300, November 11,2007 A star like any other in the sky, moved in such a way, that it could not have been an airplane.   Initially, I thought it was an airplane, but it moved backward, it moved to the side, it stopped several times, and continued in this fashion.   There was no color or blinking.   I wondered if it could have been a helicopter making those moves, but the altitude seemed higher than any helicopter that I know of.

The clincher was that after viewing the bright peachy/orange/red light it moved perpendicular to where I was standing vanished in 2sec.;2008-03-19 19:45:00;2+MIN.;The clincher was that after viewing the bright peachy/orange/red light it moved perpendicular to where I was standing vanished in 2sec. 19 March 2008    I am a 58 year old male, former science/math teacher, bakery/restaurant owner, realtor.  I am the only person here, in my home who witnessed what I am reporting. It was approximately 8pm, I was seated , relaxing with two of my three dogs. I have a full view of the mountains (the San Jacinto Mt. range).  I have floor to ceiling windows which allow me a pretty full view of the sky and the mountains. While seated, I saw an abnormally bright peachy/red/orange light approach.  It was as if it appeared from out in the sky, not from over the mountain top, like a jet or helicopter. It was the color that caught me off guard.  We have many helicopters flying to the Desert Hospital over head, but this was not the same, they usually come from the south.   The item in my view was much higher in the sky, and actually much brighter.  It moved from the top of the mountain range, east, slowly, maintaining its brightness.   The brightness was such that I could not discern any shape.  It was as if I were approaching a car with bright lights on in the evening, a stary glare.   I immediately felt that due to its color, which did not change, that it was very peculiar.  I was tempted to go inside and get my camera, but was afraid I would miss something, movement, whatever.   So, I kept watching it.  It moved from the mountain top to approximately 1/3 - Â½ across the sky.  It stopped, as if hovering, as if it was a helicopter, and then, it took off, perpendicular to where I was standing, out into space and the very bright light was gone in  less then a two seconds.   I tried to garner any fragment of light available by using the light sensitive area of the outer peripheral portion of my eye, but it was gone.

V shaped craft flying over Palm Springs, CA;2010-05-05 21:30:00;20 to 30 seconds;V shaped craft flying over Palm Springs, CA I was outside on my patio smoking a cigarette and while I was looking up at the night sky a saw a V shaped object moving slow through the air.  It was heading from north to south and flying close to the San Jacinto foothills which I live across the street from.  There were no lights or any sounds coming from the craft. I first noticed it when I blocked out a start. If I were not looking up at the time I would have missed it. I can usually hear passenger jets flying high overhead while they are traveling either eastward or westward, but I heard nothing from this thing. I would estimate that the craft was about thousand feet or less in the air and its size was about the same as a Boeing 737. I have live in Palm Spring for nearly 10 years and this is the third time I have seen something strange flying through the night sky. I love this place.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
