2 UFO's hovering 3 stories up from the ground;1999-02-20 19:00:00;1-2 minutes;2 UFO's hovering 3 stories up from the ground I was walking toward my sister’s apartment, which was a corner unit close to the side of the road.  Catty corner from where I was standing is, first a 4 to 5 lane road, after which is an entirely different apartment complex that is 2 stories high.  It was evening but not 100% dark yet, both apartment lights had automatically come on by this time.  I looked across the street at our neighboring apartments to see some lights floating above the building.  The lights matched the color of the apartment lights which were orange (that industrial orange you see everywhere).  I thought I was seeing things so I covered the apartments from my view with my right hand...  I then saw what it was that was floating above the apartments. I was amazed to see 2 UFO’s they were round, and both had 3 lights shining, the lights were round and placed in a triangle pattern at the bottom of the UFO.  They were literally 3 stories from the ground.  They hovered around each other, in very close proximity to each other, without making a sound.  They did this for what seemed to be 1-2 minutes before accelerating to speeds of, I can’t even make an educated guess at how extremely fast they took off toward the east.  They took off almost parallel to the earth (if that makes any since) in other words they didn’t go straight up they left at an angle.  Their speed literally went from maybe 1-2 mph to an excess of 200 mph in 1 second. They both left at the exact same time as if they both knew it was time to go.  As they left,  they made not one sound, they were gone and I haven’t seen them again since, although I wish I would catch another glimpse of them because they do fascinate me.  I can only imagine the view from someone in that apartment complex, to have walked outside, looked up and seen 2 UFO’s hovering above them only 3 stories from reach.  Amazing!!!!

I saw a flashing colored orb in the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains.;2004-07-24 00:00:00;15-30 seconds;I saw a flashing colored orb in the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains. What I have been witnessing began on July 19, 2004 at approximately 2:30 am.  I live in a canyon of Palm Springs, CA that is surrounded by the San Jacinto and the Santa Rosa Mountains.  Our home has many large windows that open up to view the mountains.  I awoke to use the restroom around 2:30 am and was taken aback by a large white light that was literally illuminating my bathroom.  The light was too big to be a star and was very close to the mountain top (it was in the eastern sky).  It had some dimision to it but I can't really say what shape it was, it was just the brightest light I had ever seen.  I woke my husband because I didn't want to be the only one to see it, he looked at it and agreed that he appeared to be too large and bright to be a star.  The following evening at around 9:30 pm I looked over the mountains to see if I could see this light and it wasn't there, however, there was an orb that was flashing blue, green and red lights, I observed it closer with a pair of binoculars and it appeared to be pulsating.  My husband saw it also.  We went to bed and I woke up around midnight and again at 2:30 am, the orb was still there flashing but the bright light was not there.  I went back to bed to awake again at 4:30 am and the bright light was there again, in the same spot, there were more colored flashing orbs around the sky but not as close as the one observed earlier in the evening.  I have been watching the sky every night since.  On Thursday, July 23, 2004 I was driving down Highway 111 in Palm Springs around 8:30 am, it was dusk and I saw this bright light in the western sky over the Santa Rosa Mountain range, it appeared to be moving slowly downward towards the mountain.  I got home and got my husband to come out and look, he saw it also, the light continued to drift downward until it disappeared behind the mountain range.  I looked around the sky and with my binoculars, I could see several flashing orbs, all with green, red and blue lights. Every evening since July 19th I have awoken at different times during the night to see if the light is in the eastern sky, it has never appeared before 12:30 am and is always still visable until the sun rises.  As I watch the light it slowly drifts upward.  Interestingly enough, the light in the western sky that drifts in and down appears to be the same light that settles over the mountain in the eastern sky to only drift back up until out of sight. My siting last evening is what has compelled me to report these sightings.  I awoke at 12:38 am and looked out towards the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains and I saw a circular shaped orb that had red, green, and blue lights on it and it was hovering in a stationary position over the mountain.  It was the same orb that I have seen in the sky higher up only this time it was low almost sitting on the mountain.  I watched it for about 15 seconds and then it just disappeared, I stood there with my mouth to the floor breaking out into a cold sweat.  As I kept my eyes glued to the sky, the orb reappeared, flashing and hovering and then dipped below the mountain range. The bright light was not in the sky.  I awoke at 4:30 am again to find the bright white light hovering in the same position that I saw the circular orb.  I am pretty freaked out at this point and I am starting to think I'm crazy.  Has anyone else in the Palm Springs area reported such a siteing?  I know that I will see the light again tonight, It seems to be getting closer to the mountains every evening.  The orbs continue to flash about the sky around this area.  Any clues as to what this could be???????  I am sorry that I have not photographed my siteing, however, I plan on trying to this evening.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
The whole planet,star lit up! Then it flashed to white so fast It was like someone playing with the on off switch.;2012-06-21 22:50:00;15 minutes;The whole planet,star lit up! Then it flashed to white so fast It was like someone playing with the on off switch. I.  IFO Incident (identified flying object) a.  on the night of june 21, 2012 I went out at night because I see things where I am all the time. I have seen one up close up, in march so I now know without a doubt they are here. As I wavered in the wind, for I am where windmills are. the wind gusts were up to 35mph blowing at their usual direction, from west to east in the palm springs-morongo valley wind pass.  It was an Exceptionally windy night. As I had almost decided I needed to get out of the wind, one of the stars I had been looking at, Seemed to flash.  Lately I am used to this too because so many plantes are around and making Strange flashes that show all colors of rainbows the more I look.   I noticed this star was not in the Night sky the night before, because as it was my birthday, I had made a point to go out and notice Where the stars were because they are in the same position as the day I was born.  This star Was not there.  As I looked to my right, I noticed a lot of planes really high up, then a plane Caught my eye back to the left, which Is over the southeastern portion of hwy 111 off the Hwy 10.  It is virtually desolate and one goes many miles through the middle of the desert To get to palm springs.  The plane seemed to be flashing really bright when I realized it Was the star. It looked like it had actually turned on. The plane looked like it was going to go right into this star, when I realized it was so high up that the plane was just a tiny dot in proportion to the immese size of this perfectly round looking planet/star.  Immediately, my mind knew it was Just another planet making the wild color show, when low and behold, it flashed bright red! Like a flashlight in the sky! The whole planet,star lit up! Then it flashed to white so fast It was like someone playing with the on off switch, from clear white to red. As it was blowing My mind, just for half a second I looked over to my right where I thought I saw something, But then my left peripheral saw something come out of the planet/star.  As I looked  back to the planet/star, an ifo craft had shot out of it and flew straight up and then over to The east, in it’s curvy straight way until it disappeared from being so high and going so fast straight to the east. And then I looked at the planet/star and it had started moving to it’s northwest at the moment The craft launched. The wind was gusting from west to east.  It then moved very very slowly northwest then went straight west, into the horizon.  I had time to go get my camera but was too excited to get it to work.  This all took like 15 minutes for it to cruise out of sight. It flashed red to white the whole time like it wasn’t worried about being seen, yet where it was is in the Middle of the big desert.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Two white orbs above Downtown Palm Springs, spotted by at least two completely sober people.;2012-08-26 21:18:00;9 seconds, then 3 seconds;Two white orbs above Downtown Palm Springs, spotted by at least two completely sober people. My girlfriend (called Y) and I were in the pool this evening and saw two UFOs above Palm Springs.   The first one was like a very bright plane with no blinking light, the light itself was very white-white, and it was moving almost like a plane, south over downtown. Just as Y jokingly said, Maybe it's a UFO.  It proceeded to slow down and slightly change direction (either west, or up... not sure), and over the course of 3 or 4 seconds, the round white light dimmed to orange, then, slowly to red, then it faded out not behind clouds or anything, it was crystal clear out. And I know that nothing that big and bright could go out of sight relatively instantly. About 5 minutes later, as we were still in the pool tripping out, she said 'look, another one!' I totally didnt believe her at first, but sure enough, there was an already dim one changing direction and fading out. It was just above the mountain behind Downtown Palm Springs. I am so pumped we got to see them.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838

3 orbs in a triangular formation high in the sky with no sound or explanation.;2021-03-12 12:10:00;20 Seconds;3 orbs in a triangular formation high in the sky with no sound or explanation. While my wife and I were eating lunch I noticed a triangle of 3 orbs in the sky. I watched for a few seconds to try to ID what I was seeing and then one orb broke formation and then held a different pattern. I knew it was an unknown object at that time so I began filming. What’s weird is the objects flashed out of view and my camera went blurry. I thought I lost them for the rest of the clip but they were moved to the top part of the video. I didn’t move my camera down, they just went upward out of view. You can tell be the clouds in the video. Pretty wild! I’ll send clip to the link provided.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
