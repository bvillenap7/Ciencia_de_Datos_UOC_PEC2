Palm Springs lights.;2014-07-19 21:40:00;15 minutes;Palm Springs lights My son and I were sitting by the pool at our apartment in Palm Springs, CA, at  approximately 1940 hours on 07/19/2014.  We saw reddish orange teardrop objects in the Southern sky towards Indian Canyon.   They appeared to rise from the bottom of the hills and rise to the top.   At first they appeared to be moving towards us as they were rising and then they just kind of disappeared.   The first ones we saw there were about 5 of them and then we saw 3 more of them and then 2 more and no more after that.   They just seemed to move in a almost straight up and then disappear.   The first five we saw rose up really high and then disappeared.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
