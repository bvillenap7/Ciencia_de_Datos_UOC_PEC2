Black triangle-shaped craft hovered at low altitude next to freeway for at least 30 minutes on Halloween night 1995.;1995-11-01 04:00:00;30 minutes;Black triangle-shaped craft hovered at low altitude next to freeway for at least 30 minutes on Halloween night 1995. On November 1, 1995, at approximately 4 a.m. Pacific time, I was driving home from a concert in Los Angeles on eastbound Interstate 10 passing through Banning, Calif., on my way to Palm Springs, Calif. Three of my friends were riding in my car one in the passenger seat was awake and two others in the back were asleep. I noticed a light in the sky straight ahead of me at a distance of what I guessed was about 10-15 miles.  At first, I thought it was the light atop the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, until I realized that it was on the opposite side of the mountains from where it should be.   I continued to watch the light, and over the next few minutes I noticed that it seemed to be pulsating, going from dim to bright and back again every 10 seconds or so. As I kept driving, I noticed a couple more things.  First, the light didn't seem to be getting closer to us on its own. Second, it wasn't changing altitude.  At this point, I remarked to my friend in the passenger seat about it and asked if he could see it, and he confirmed that he did. I told him I thought it looked like the landing lights of an airliner headed in our direction, but we both agreed that couldn't be the case since there is no airport in the direction it would have been headed. We continued to watch the light as we got closer to it, and it continued its slow pulsating, staying in the same position at the same altitude.  At this point, it was nearing 4:30 in the morning and there were several other cars on the freeway.  My friend and I had started to openly ask what it could be at this point, running through possibilities such as a helicopter or blimp. We got even closer and could tell it was something highly unusual. It was hovering above an area just beyond where the freeway split off to Highway 111, which was the route we needed to take to get home to Palm Springs. The area it was over is next to a rest stop off of Interstate 10, which at the time was brightly illuminated. As we reached the start of the turn-off for Highway 111, we could see three distinct lights facing us from the object which were pale blue in color.  They seemed to have stopped pulsating by this point but didn't illuminate the object itself. It was, as I've come to say over the years, stuck in the air.  It was only a few hundred feet off the ground at most and utterly still.  More than anything, it was the absolute stillness with which it hung in the air that convinced my friend and I that this was not a normal aircraft.  It was as if it was somehow &quotdisconnected&quot from gravity. We'd slowed to about 10 miles an hour as we took the off-ramp and had rolled down the windows.  My friend had his head out the passenger side window and I was craning my neck to push my face against the windshield and look up at the object.  We didn't hear any sound, other than the air rushing past the car.  At this point, the object began to move very slowly across the highway directly above us.  I could clearly see three pale blue lights in a triangle formation, seemingly at the &quottips&quot of the object, and one slightly larger pale blue light at what I assumed was its center.  The sky was clear and full of stars, so while I couldn't see the hull of the object, I could see that it was blocking the stars above it and appeared to be a solid triangle about 150 feet on each side from light to light.  The lights on it did not illuminate the skin of its hull, however. I kept driving and we passed underneath it. My friend watched it out of the passenger side window and then said, It's gone.  The entire sighting, from when I first noticed the light to when the object passed overhead, lasted approximately 30 minutes.  During that time, I can only imagine that dozens of cars must have passed near it, since it was hovering right next to the freeway.  I've always been sort of amazed by this, especially when I'd begin to consider that perhaps it was a military test craft.  For something you wouldn't think someone would want seen, it was sitting only a few hundred feet in the air next to a fairly busy freeway.  My friend has remarked that he couldn't imagine a military vehicle utilizing a technology as exotic as anti-gravity being operated near a populated area, for fear that an accident could potentially harm a large number of people, given the sort of power source something like that would undoubtedly require.   To this day, I'm not sure if what I saw was something of ours, or not, but I came away from the experience feeling like anything was possible.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Gold triangle over Palm Springs;1999-03-23 14:15:00;30 Min;Gold triangle over Palm Springs The object appeared to the east of Palm Springs at about 2:15 PM, Flew across the moon's face from a east to west direction, then came to a complete stop about 2 above the moon. Object then moved southerly for about 10 then came to a stop. Once again moved in a south to north direction across the moon's face and stopped to the north of Palm Springs over Desert Hot Springs, Ca.. Object hovered for about 15 to 20 min. I noticed that the object rotated in a counter clock wise motion, which would flash when the sun ray's hit the object. The Object appeared to be an upright Triangle made of gold. When i lost sight of it, i figured that was the last of it, Then about 30 min's later i spotted the object once again hovering over Palm Springs, but the object appeared to be about a good 3 to 4 miles high. WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE SPOTTED THE OBJECT.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Triangular formation of lights moving very slowly southwards;1999-07-27 02:45:00;10 Seconds;Triangular formation of lights moving very slowly southwards Saturday AM 2:30 -3:00 July 24th 1999. Palm Springs, Grenfell Avenue. Flying South. Got back to our appartment looking at a meteorite shower in the southern sky. A Triangular shaped object moved slowly from North to South. At first we presumed it was flying high because of the silence, but that would have made the size of the object huge. We agreed that it was flying a few thousand feet up MAX. The underside lighting was very, very subtle not at all what I would imagine. They were rectangular, very dim ,orange, arranged in pairs in a triangular formation, if we had not been looking for meteorites we would not have noticed it. We watched it for about 10 seconds before it turned very slowly in an Eastern direction and dissapeared. It must have passed over Palm Springs Airport...did anybody else witness this?;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Dull Black Triangle with unattached capsule hovering briefly, then took off at an unbelievable speed-no noise!;2000-04-27 09:15:00;45 seconds;Dull Black Triangle with unattached capsule hovering briefly, then took off at an unbelievable speed-no noise! Although it has been 11 years, I always felt I should report this.  My head would not allow me to admit that this was anything other than a government experiment.    I had rented a car out of Palm Springs, Ca., to drive too San Francisco and fly back to Mass.  I was about a half hour out of Palm Springs, northwest on RT 10. @ approx. 9am.  I was on a long stretch through the desert that seemed never ending.  A very distant mountain range off to my left.  It was so far away, it looked small.  But I knew it was hundreds of miles away.  There was a car in front of me about 1 mile ahead. I happened to notice, all of a sudden, something in the air almost above me.  I leaned forward too look out, and up, and off to the right side of my car.  About 200-300 feet in the air was a perfect triangle shaped object just hovering there!  I said, what ((is that)), and slammed on my brakes.   I also noticed a car about a mile ahead had pulled over.  (The only other vehicle in sight)   I opened my door and got out to see this.  It was a triangle about the size of a small plane!  It was a dull black color like I have never seen before.  No windows, no lights, no rivets to support it’s construction (very smooth), no sound, no movement.  It was thicker in the middle, but didn’t look big enough for a person to be in it!   Now, this is the part that has been unsettling for me.  Next to the object was a capsule hovering next to it maybe a few feet away from the craft.  (Not Connected)   Looked like a Tylenol Capsule two tone colors and about 3 feet long!   Half was gray and the other half was purple of sort.  Keep in mind these colors were very dull with no shine to them.   The craft rotated about 90 degrees, as did the unattached capsule.   Then it shot off toward the mountain range at a speed that was unbelievable.  It went up and over the mountain range and was gone!   The mountain range was far away.   It took about 2 seconds from the time it shot off, until it was out of sight.   The unattached capsule stayed with it.  No Noise,  No air stream,  Nothing!    I got in my car and drove on.  I turned up the music and told myself it was a government thing, and tried to forget.   Over the years I have read about UFO sightings, waiting for one to describe what I had seen.   A lot of triangular shaped crafts, but never anything about a capsule somehow held close unattached, maybe by magnetic science.   The speed and lack of noise was unbelievable!   All this happened in about 40 seconds!;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Triangular dull orange glow object moving very fast across mountain range.;2005-04-06 21:04:00;4 seconds;Triangular dull orange glow object moving very fast across mountain range. The triangular object was a dull orange and I watched it travel in front of the San Jacinto Mountain range from North by Northwest (point of discovery of object in sky)to the South at a high rate of speed in a downwarl sloping pattern and you could see the object turn on its side (which changed the figuration of the triangle)and banking upward (15 degrees)then dissapearing beyond the Southern horizon. No audible sound, no flashing lights... Just a dull orange glow.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Three Identical Craft Sighted Over Palm Spings, California  Slowly Come Together...And Vanish.;2007-11-18 16:30:00;4-5 minutes;Three Identical Craft Sighted Over Palm Spings, California Slowly Come Together...And Vanish. On Sunday, November 18, 2007, my partner and I observed three UFO's flying high in the late afternoon sky over Palm Springs, California. The sightings occurred at approximately 4:30 p.m. The crafts remained visible to the naked eye for about five minutes before disappearing.  We were in the downtown area of Palm Springs when the sighting occurred. I was the first to notice something unusual. I was looking up towards the moon (which was clearly visible to me at that hour) when I spotted an elongated boomerang, or triangular shaped craft flying in a southwest direction. At first, the object appeared to be flying in a straight line like a normal aircraft. It also seemed to be at about the same altitude that a commercial aircraft normally flies while at cruising altitude, approximately 25,000-35,000 feet. From that distance, I would estimate the size of the craft to be similar in size to a small to medium sized commercial aircraft.  While watching the unidentified craft for a minute or so, I noticed that it started to move in ways that normal aircraft don’t. It slowly came to a stop, suspended in midair like a helicopter. That’s when I pointed it out to my partner, who saw the object as clearly as I had. The craft then moved around its location sluggishly and, in what appeared to be, a somewhat erratic fashion. All of the sudden, two other identical craft came into view in close relative proximity to the fist craft. The three objects began to slowly “wobble” towards a center point. For about four or five minutes they leisurely moved around and, on occasion, become completely stationary. Once the objects reached their center point destination, they vanished from sight. It should be noted that the sky at that time of day was perfectly clear with exceptional visibility. Each craft was identical in size and shape to one another. Another unusual attribute of the crafts was that although they were shaped like a boomerang, they flew with the curvature to one side. In other words, the objects flew “sideways”. About the witnesses: I am a 47 year-old marketing executive and creative consultant to the motion picture industry. I hold a B.A. degree in Radio, Television, and Film from a major university in southern California.  I am an FAA licensed pilot certified to fly single engine aircraft.  My partner is also 47 years old and has post-graduate degrees in Political Science and Art History from a prestigious and internationally recognized university.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Black Triangle over Palm Springs California;2008-05-08 23:25:00;2 minutes;Black Triangle over Palm Springs California I was standing outside on a balcony of a condo that is very close to the Palm Springs airport. I was talking on the phone and was looking up into the night sky. I was describing the weather to a friend of mine when I noticed a triangular shaped object moving silently in the sky above me but not directly above me. It was fairly high up and was completely dark. The only way I was able to see it was because the city lights were reflecting off of it. If I hadn't looked up I never would have seen it. It was very dark in color like a slate gray except for circles at the tips of the triangles and perhaps circles in between and in the center. It happened so fast and I was so stunned by what I was seeing that I can't be sure of the number of circles. The circles looked to be a light gray. I had the impression that the circles were like bumps. It moved fairly slowly toward the East. Because it was so dark, I was unable to see it for very long and it soon disappeared into the eastern sky.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Bright scooting light just disappears;2008-11-10 01:53:00;2 - 4 seconds;Bright scooting light just disappears Observed at a nearly 90 degree angle.  As I was looking at the sky, a moving triangularly-shaped light caught my eye. There were no flashing or colored lights, simply one bright light. As it scooted across the sky I tried to peg it as maybe a shooting star (too slow and steady for that), a satellite, or aircraft(questionably large and bright for these objects, also no flashing lights observed). As I was considering the possiblitites, it simply vanished. It did not reappear. No cloud cover this evening no obstacles in my view.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838

4 bright lighted ufos over Palm Springs, CA.;2016-06-08 21:00:00;5 minutes;4 bright lighted ufos over Palm Springs, CA. A friend was leaving my home to go to his home after dinner.  It was approx. 10pm.   After we had said good night, he ran back in the house and said come out here at look at this.  There were four large crafts traveling at a high rate of speed, coming from the east and going west.   My location is right across the street from the Palm Springs Airport.  As we watched in disbelief, they appeared to come to a stop.  From the stopped position, the lights seem to get smaller, so maybe they were flying straight up, I'm not sure.  The aircrafts are still there over an hour later.  They do not seem to be moving at all.  The lights now look almost like stars, except they are brighter.  While this was going on, a helicopter took off from the airport and flew right over my house and then landed,  About 20 seconds later it took off again, and did the exact same thing.  It did this four times. very strange;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838

Speed difficult to estimate, but if altitude was 15,000 ft it was 50% + quicker than a commercial plane and considerably large base to the triangle than any wingspan i know to exist. Given the sky was black, vehicle did disappear instantly or maybe lights shut off. I do not know.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
