I also saw this formation change about 5 minutes later, split into 2 formations, one reminded me of a kite, but i now know it was replicating the Little Dipper.  Listening to Peter Davenport on the Art Bell show tonight 11-22-03..i think this is what they saw in New York, or similar to it.  this event recurred on 4-14-03 but not in the same formations and my husband also saw them on 4=14=03;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
3 white lights the size and brightness of stars playfully circling around each other then flying out of sight in triangle.;2013-04-01 23:30:00;4-5 minutes;3 white lights the size and brightness of stars playfully circling around each other then flying out of sight in triangle. In an open space on a hotel property I was informed by another couple to look up in the clear night sky.  Almost directly above us my buddy and I observed 3 lights, approximately the brightness and color of medium lit stars.  Lights did not blink nor change color.  They appeared to be playful in the sense that they were making these elliptical turns around each other.  Almost like they were playing chase or taking turns cornering each other. My first impression was that they were birds.  This couldn't be the case because they never changed shape or brightness through all their turns and gyrations.  If they were aircraft of some sort, the same would apply.  They reminded me of satellites that don't flicker or change in brightness as they move across the sky.  No noise was ever heard. After approximately 5 minutes they stopped dancing around each other, and steadily flew off and out of sight in a triangle pattern.  My experience sounds very similar to the sightings reported here from San Jose, CA, hours earlier that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly advertising lights??  PD));33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
((HOAX??))  The word Mars written In the Sky by lights.  ((anonymous report))((NUFORC Note:  No other reports submitted.  PD));2017-03-18 23:00:00;30 seconds;The word &quotMars&quot written In the Sky by lights My girlfriend and I went outside to walk our dogs in Palm Springs, Ca, and we saw the craziest lights.  There were hundreds of lights in the sky that were made to spell MARS. Each letter seemed to be a quarter mile long and each letter was composed of dozens of individual lights.  Each letter also flashed at the same time and the same exact color.  It was surreal.  The word Mars lasted in the sky for over 30 seconds, proving it was not fireworks and there was no way these were drones.  The lights were insanely bright!  The letter M was comprised of dozens of red lights, the A were dozens of blue lights and so on.  My stomach dropped when I saw these because there was no way this was man made. As the lights dimmed and shut off, there was a lasting blue hue from each individual light, and it then turned to just a few twinkling lights in the sky until there was Darkness.  No smoke,  Just clear black sky. ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports submitted.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I was sitting in my hot tube very sober just gazing at the stars.  I pointed to the strange orange stars and told my partner but he couldn’t follow them  nor see them. I have very good night vision and distance.  At 8:35 I looked up and notice some strange orange stars in a V shape.  The formation of stars were not stars they were a squadron of 10 to 14 fast moving aircraft moving in a formation like ducks flying in a pattern.  As they banked  around the mt their shape went from a V to t shape but I realized the V shaped appeared to be a t to me as they moved at different levels.  They straightened out and followed the 10 Hwy North towards Banning .  This is my first sighting. I had a former partner who was a military pilot in The Korean war and he once saw a squadron of ships fly over him while in the South Pacific.

4 orange lights , one behind the other. Then a 5th one  going faster to catch up. One by one they all went dark.;2020-12-31 23:10:00;3 minutes;4 orange lights , one behind the other. Then a 5th one  going faster to catch up. One by one they all went dark. five orange lights , round, about the size of the letter O in a persons normal handwriting but up in the sky , of course,. The first four were in line ,or formation, one behind the other.  They were coming in from about  30 degrees to the west, or  to the left,  from where North is on the compass. And then we saw the 5th one. It had been lagging behind and  was flying faster than the 4  so I“m assuming it was trying to catch up. They were silent, flying about as high as helicopters do.  Then one by one they went dark. Lasted about 3 minutes. It was 11:10  or 23:10 military time no clouds in the full, moonlit evening sky. And even with binoculars we could not see the shape of the aircraft.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Formation of ten bright lights over Palm Springs;2021-05-06 04:45:00;1-2 minutes;Formation of ten bright lights over Palm Springs Ten lights were moving in a southeasterly direction in what appeared to be a formation. Lights were spaced evenly apart at approximately one to two degrees separation. Their speed seemed to be constant, they were not accelerating. The lights were bright white, there were no colored lights visible and no sound at all. The lights were not moving in the direction of Palm Springs airport and disappeared to the southeast about 2 minutes after the initial siting. I did not have my camera with me to take pictures.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
