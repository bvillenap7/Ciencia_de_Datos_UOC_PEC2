I stop;1999-11-30 18:45:00;3 minutes;I was traveling north by automobile when I observed an object traveling in a southernly direction at a very slow rate of speed.  I stopped and stayed in my car while it continued to descend until it was hidden from my view behind a 3 or 4 story building.  It was a large oval shape. The underside was completely illuminated in a white light with several flashing white lights. I was traveling north by automobile in central Palm Springs on El Segundo St. between the convention center and the Spa Hotel & Casino on November 30, 1999 at about 5:45 pm. I observed a large oval object in the sky coming towards me in a southwesterly direction. I stopped and stayed in my car while I observed it. I had no competition from street lights since Palm Springs has few of them. It was at a low altitude and was descending. I continued to watch it until it was hidden from my view behind a 3 or 4 story building. The underside was completely illuminated in soft white light.  Several flashing white lights were located around the perimeter.  I continued to observe it for about 3 minutes. It did not resemble a blimp, but I did try to contact the Palm Springs Airport but was unable to navigate through the menus to reach a human to confirm if a blimp had been in the area.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Bright light over Palm Springs;2000-08-20 15:00:00;15min;Bright light over Palm Springs This sighting was observed during the daylight from my pool. Looking to the north this bright lighted object came from the north in a south direction stopping along the way. It appeared to be looking at the airport. It hovered over the south end of the airport for approx 5 minutes turned 180 deg and slowly headed North. It looked like a bright light bulb shining in the sky. It faded out in the haze to the north.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
Large dimly lit mass crossed the sky steadily and silently.;2012-04-12 21:00:00;2 minutes;Large dimly lit mass crossed the sky steadily and silently. My husband and I were on vacation, lying on lounge chairs outside the house we were renting, looking up at the starry night, we saw a huge oval shaped mass the length of many football fields and extremely high in the sky, crossed steadily over us across the night sky. The mass was very dimly lit and almost translucent. There were several small planes flying by in the air at the same time so we could see how much higher and bigger this mass was compared to a plane. It was silent and illuminated on the side that was leading it across the sky. Not beams of light coming from it but just illuminated. It moved quickly and steadily until it was out of our view. We continued to ask each other the whole two minutes or so that it crossed over, What the heck is THAT?  It was too big and too shaped to be a cloud and moved too fast. My husband and I didn't even believe in UFOs but now that we have seen that together, we're extremely curious and are thankful that we both saw it. We'd love help with an explanation maybe specific to that area since we are not from there.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
