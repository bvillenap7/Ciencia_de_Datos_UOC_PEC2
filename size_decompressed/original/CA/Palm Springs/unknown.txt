Large bluish glow/light seen in sky in Palm Springs, CA.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:15:00;20 minutes;Large bluish glow/light seen in sky in Palm Springs, CA - Nov. 7, 2015 ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD)) My wife called me and my daughter outside (her mother came out a few minutes later), to witness a large bluish glow up in the dark sky. It was oval shape in appearance, and very large. About the size of a golf ball (elongated), if held out a arms length, up towards the sky. The bluish glow (light) moved slowly across the sky, then back again, before fading out. The bluish light was not a normal light, and wasn't that bright, but bright enough to easily be seen (glow). I wouldn't be surprised if other people witnessed this too. Waiting now for the explanation that scientists want us to hear. Between UFOs, CERN, the 2nd coming - end of the world, etc...-things are happening faster, more often, and all over the world.

There was a pattern in which each orb would flash its light in my direction, one at a time. They were flying in a direction and would disappear as more would keep appearing. This went on for close to 20 minutes. There were airplanes close by, sharing the airspace and there is an airport close by.;33.8356837837846;-116.531581837838
