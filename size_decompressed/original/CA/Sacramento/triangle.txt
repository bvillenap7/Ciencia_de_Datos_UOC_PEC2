Triangle lights in the sky put on a laser light show, hovering over city.;1993-05-18 23:00:00;5-10 minutes;triangle lights in the sky put on a laser light show, hovering over city. I've been wanting to tell this event for a long time, we lived on the corner of 13th and F streets in downtown. across the street from our apartment was a vacant lot where I would walk my dog and let him re-leave himself.   I had walked him over to the lot and he went, my two son's where in the apartment, my youngest was 2 years old and my oldest was 15 years old.   As I was headed back across the street to go home, I don't know what made me look up? maybe it was something my dog did, but I did, I looked up.  It was one of those nights where the fog was sitting just above the tops of the buildings, not on the ground.   There in the fog I saw lights in the shape of a triangle, hovering just above me in the fog.  The triangle was large maybe about 10 ft per side.  I ran back in the house with the dog and told my oldest son to come out with me fast so he could see it, we left the dog in the house and went back down to the street.   The triangle light was still there, we stood there n the middle of the crosswalk staring up at the sky.  For the next several minutes we watched what is somewhat difficult to describe, other than it reminded me of something you might see when dealing with special effects on television, (computers now), but that's not how I would have described it then.   The triangle divided itself in half smoothly without a break in the light, into two triangles, always touching at some point, as they seemed to roll along the others side, before dividing again turning into three then four, almost dancing off of each other.  The lights where bright blues and reds, always changing. It was like watching nothing I have ever seen from anything that I know could be in the sky.   Standing there fixated on these lights, we heard some neighbors come out of the apartment just a few doors down on F street, seeing us standing there staring up into the sky, we heard them laugh and say something to the matter of, what the hell are they doing? I turned my head and looked at them, there were two people there, and at that point they had looked up, the next thing I heard was,  Holly ((word deleted)), as they too saw the lights in the sky, and then out of no where the lights vanished and it stopped.   The strangest thing about this event, was years later my youngest son when he was somewhere between 8 to 11 years old, told me he remembered as an infant being visited by what he would later know as aliens.    Having very vivid memory's myself as early as 2 years of age about just life, normal stuff, I am inclined to believe him. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Spectacular triangle's seem in the sky;1993-11-01 23:00:00;20minutes;Spectacular triangle's seem in the sky It was 1993 when this event happened. I was living in down town Sacramento, California. I don’t remember what time of year it was, but I lived on the corner of 13th street and F street. I always took my dog out for a potty walk, roughly between 10 and 11p.m. Across from our place was a vacant lot, that I always walked him in. I took him out that night as I always did and walked across the street to the vacant lot. It was a cool evening and the fog was hovering above the roof tops, when I noticed above me, in the fog, lights. I looked up and was amazed at what I saw. There were three sets of triangular lights, each triangle was made up of three long strips of light, formed into each triangle. What ever it was, where ever they came from, was huge, I don’t even believe I could accurately describe the size. They were enter moving about each other, they were red and blue. I could only compare what I was looking at, to some type of computer graphic design you might see on the web. I was so amazed that I ran back into the house and asked my then 15 year old son to come out and look too. He did, and we both stood there in the middle of the street amazed, at what we were watching above our heads, the lights moving in and out of each other, and changing about, while what ever was making them, hid in the fog. I didn’t own a video camera at the time, or I would have tried to film the spectacular sight that was occurring. We stood there, my son and I, for a very long time. Two of our neighbors emerged from their apartment, and at first look, they laughed at us, like what the heck are they doing standing in the middle of the street. And then they too, glanced up to the sky above us, and muttered something to the matter of profanity when they too saw the lights. It was at that moment that the lights disappeared. I have never in my life before or since seem anything like it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

I was gazing out the window, when we came to a stop sign I looked up and saw a large triangle made of a series of lights. The back sections of the craft passed over each other. I looked at the center of it and could (barely) see what resembeld a domb, with a gray tent to it, and on the sides of the craft it appeared to have almost bumper pad shaped structures on it. It slowly passed over us and then vanished after about a 100 feet.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Sighting of V shaped craft over Sacramento, California on 5/28/00 by three witness'.;2000-05-28 22:32:00;7 to 10 sec.;Sighting of V shaped craft over Sacramento, California on 5/28/00 by three witness'. I went out to close the tuff shed, after locking the shed I looked up to the north. I saw a strobing light (It strobed only twice) then it went out. Then a very bright light came on then faded out, there was a distance between the strobing light and the bright light. No other lights were present. Then it was gone. (No blue or red lights like on a airplane).  I went inside my house and told my wife and our friend, I saw something really strange, and they followed me outside immediately, we were looking to the west.  I was telling them what I had just saw. Then I said look at that, and pointed my finger up and we saw a V shaped craft (7 lights in a V shape) it headed west to east. It seemed to be just one object.  All the lights were the same brightness and size. We watched the object for about 7 to 10 seconds as it traveled to the east very quickly and silently and then if just disappeared. There was no sound at all.  My wife and our friend stayed outside looking for the object as I went inside and looked at the time (It was 10:32 pm) and I called Peter Davenport immediately.  We all stayed outside for some time after the sighting and observed several aircraft in the area. This object was definitely not an airplane or like anything any of us had ever seen before. (Our house is located about 2 miles east of McCellan Airforce Base.) The witness' were myself (Age 37 - Communications Technician) my wife (Age 37 - Stay at home mom) and our friend of 23 years (Age 36 - Insurance Agent) who was visiting from the Redding area with her 2 daughters for the holiday weekend. ((NUFORC Note--We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be a good witness.  We have no idea what the observers witnessed.  PD));38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Low flying Triangular Object w/ 7 lights.  As it passed overhead appeared to be a 5 sided dark gray object.;2003-11-24 06:20:00;1 minute;Low flying Triangular Object w/ 7 lights.  As it passed overhead appeared to be a 5 sided dark gray object. Coming to work I noticed what appeared at first to be a Triangular object, flying east, lower than a passenger airplane.  It was flying in a direction that I see many military planes coming into Mather.  At first glance it had a total of 7 lights, boomerang shaped, all lit-up.   As it approached, all the lights went out except the front single light.  Then the single front light went out and the last lights on each side lit-up, then those went out and the second to last lights lit-up, this sequence continued through the lights to the front of the object.  This sequence took place two times.  By this point the object was nearing overhead.  And it looked as though the lights started a new sequence moving from one tail end to the front then back to the other tail end.  As it came directly overhead, I saw no lights, and saw it’s shape, which was not Triangular - but instead a five sided object.  It looked to be a dark colored object.  Gray in color.  After it passed over my car, I could not find it in the sky.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Triangle shaped object spotted over Sacramento River.;2010-01-02 18:00:00;4min;Triangle shaped object spotted over Sacramento River. On the evening of January 2, 2010, my friend and I were driving East over the Capital Mall bridge from West Sacramento across the Sacramento river into downtown Sacramento.  It was a beautifully clear night.  I noticed lights over the I-5 freeway that seemed to be too low in the sky to be a plane and they didn't appear to be a helicopter.  As we approached the object appeared to be hovering.  I pointed it out to my friend who was driving and said, What the hell is that!   At that time we were approaching a stop light on the corner of 3rd and Capital Mall and it was clear the object was moving but very slow.   At that point with all the lights from the freeway and building etc, all we could make out were the lights on the object which I think were red and white.  As we turned left heading South on 3rd Street, the object passed overhead slightly to the rear of the truck and we both clearly saw the triangle shape.  It headed West across the Sacramento River tow! ard the Port of Sacramento which is located in West Sacramento.  We both saw the triangle shape clearly as it passed overhead and we could see a white light in the center of the triangle.  Once it went over the river it tilted to the right and headed in a Northerly direction.  There were no news reports of any kind the next day.  It boggles the mind that something that big and that incredably close went unnoticed. BACKGROUND INFO:  My friend and I are both 54 year old females.  She retired from State Service and lives in Idaho but is currently working as a retired annuitant.  Prior to retiring, she was an investigator.  She's a ittle more closed lipped about it then I am but when I told other friends she substantiated what we saw.  I am an Equal Employment Opportunity(EEO) Officer,  My job entails investigations as well.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

It made 10-11 abrupt turns in accute angels. It would do barrel rolls and compleatly dissapear then pop back up within seconds. Eventualy it fell at an angel going south and we didnt see it for 30 seconds.  Then it flew straight up into the sky by the renisaunce tower still dancing through down towns high rise weeving through the buildings.

Three white dots each in a triangle formation and then faded away.;2012-04-19 18:25:00;45 seconds;Three white dots each in a triangle formation and then faded away. I just finished cutting my back lawn and was out of breath a little and turned off the mower and laid on the sidewalk between the garage and my plum tree.  As I looked up I saw 6 to 9 triangle lights kind of in formation right between the tree and the garage.  As I watched them they moved forward and the back a little and then forward and back again.  I raised my glasses because they can foul me up and when I did I saw just white dots.  But they were still there.  I put my glasses back on and there were three white dots for each one as the move up and back.  This went on for about 35-45 seconds and then the just disappeared.  The sky was blue or as blue as it gets in downtown Sacramento. I have seen pictures of ufo’s that look like what I saw.  Three large round white lights on the bottom in a triangle shape.  There were more than six and maybe as many as nine sets of three lights in a triangle formation but not fixed to each other.  Never seen anything like it, ever.  The way they just faded out was interesting too.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

When outside of my home looking north into the night sky I noticed a triangular-shaped craft heading south toward my location. The object appeared to be immense in size although distant.It was very faint and stealthy as it moved at extraordinary speed. Once it got closer I noticed white lights at each corner of an extended triangle-shaped craft.It emitted no sound,even once above my home. I observed it go from the northern horizon to the southern horizon in about 30 seconds.  Even though the object could be noticed only by the three triangle-corner edge lights, It had an awesome,intimidating presence.It was moving too fast to go get a camera so I just watched the smooth-floating object as it faded into the night sky.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Looked like green,yellow and red blinking back and forth on one craft.   Stationary at one low level in the sky.  Looked at it for maybe two minutes, (craft @ 2miles away) went over to my porch for less than a minute, went back into the yard and saw the craft about 6 houses away not with blinking lights but now with 5 - bright headlights (like on a car but spaced) seemed to be coming straight for me, no noise from craft, I became afraid and stepped under my porch, walked to the other side of my porch and saw a triangle shaped craft (somewhat like a stealth bomber), flat black, no lights anywhere under the craft, no moon in the sky so it blended into the sky very well.  Looked to be @ 200 ft in the sky, now all lights off, maybe the size of my two story home, I could barely hear the noise from the eng! ine,sounded more like rushing air than a gas powered engine.   I was able to see that is was real because it seemed to be flying at a very slow speed, @ 20 mph. I lost sight of it as it went west through the neighborhood.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

As I watched them I was covered in goosebumps.  After maybe 2 minutes the 3 lights began to change their color to starlight color  If there was only one of them doing this I could have passed it off as the red shift of a star. but not all three at once.  The final  thing that happened was the all began to dim and disappear at the same time.  The light that was to the right then cam back on for about 10 seconds then was gone.
