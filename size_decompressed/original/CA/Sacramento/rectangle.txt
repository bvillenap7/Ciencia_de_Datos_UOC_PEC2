fire emitting rectangle shaped object traveling at high velocity, low attitude roocket blasting noise then vanished silent.;1976-08-08 19:30:00;5 min.;fire emitting rectangle shaped object traveling at high velocity, low attitude roocket blasting noise then vanished silent. Giant metallic rectangle shaped object seen at night spewing blue flames, traveling right to left northwest direction low altitude,2000-5000 feet, high velocity.  The flames illuminated the object, though seen during the evening. Rocket noise heard than it vanished silent into cloud cover. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Long Lasting Fireball blazes accross Sacramento Sky;2000-07-07 21:35:00;4 Minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Vandenberg AFB at 2125 hrs…  PD)) Long Lasting Fireball blazes accross Sacramento Sky Was in my boat on Sacramento River near Confluence with American River when in the skies to our North we saw an amazing rectangular fireball which seemed to project light behind it as it went by. Suddenly, after4 or 5 minutes of watching in fascination, it appeared that the fireball blew up or dissolved. The light was still light blue for about 10 minutes after in the area where the light had been projecting. The most amazing thing any of us had ever seen.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Steady moving narrow rectangle over Sacramento;2008-11-07 01:33:00;10 seconds;Steady moving narrow rectangle over Sacramento While doing backyard astronomy, a very thin rectangle object with 10 faint lights, uniformly distributed, was flying over, South to North, high in the sky (it passed through Cassiopeia from my perspective looking to the West.).   With my arm outstretched the object was the length of my thumb (about 2.5).  Using that as a measure, the depth of the rectangle object would have only been about .25.   It flew cross-wise, meaning the wide part of the rectangle was the front/back of the object--perpendicular to its flight path.   The lights were quite faint, but white and as the object approached the city's light pollution, I could no longer make out the object. It didn't disappear, it was just too faint to make out any longer as it flew into the light pollution.  I heard no sound coming from the object.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Translucent shimmering white soft edges rectangle wide as a the side of an AMTRAC train car.;2010-08-31 22:25:00;2-3 minutes;Translucent shimmering white soft edges rectangle wide as a the side of an AMTRAC train car. Vitals: Clear skys 68 F0  and low humidity  Approximately around 22:25 Pacific Standard time looking at the south sky (I do that every night walking my dog in the backyard) I noted this light traveling horizontal at a relative fast constant speed, guessing about 100- 300 MPH about 45 degrees from the ground traveling on a north east direction about less than 1000ft high.   Though I saw the UFO by Mather AFB (formerly an air force base) over extended right base heading west (by Capital Christian church) it cross over  the flight pattern heading east.  The shape of the object seem more like a comet's tail except it did not flare out like a comet, but more like long lengthy wavering shimmer of white.  Not like a comet where the pattern trail is consistent. This object had waves as it traveled from south to north east.  The closest shape would be a smooth long rectangular see through cloud that was traveling fast and keeping its shape too, Not a lenticular cloud.  As private pilot and air crew in the air force, I have neve! r seen this type of cloud move so fast with a white shimmer contrasting with the black background, the night sky. In fact I have never seen this at all.  It reminds me of a spirit like in the movies, but much longer than a C-5 Air craft. I had time to take good look, around for clouds, other air craft's that are usually noisy, but this one did not have a noise or any sound.  It did not leave a trail, but it did move relatively fast, faster than plane coming into Mather's flying pattern.  In fact I was able to run to the second floor and look out the east window of the house and continued to observe it.  I mention it to my wife who was also upstairs and we both quickly looked out the east window and saw it together.  Although my wife is near sighted, she still was able to see a faint cloud like shape moving horizontal.  The object disappeared with our neighborhood lights. I can tell you what it's not: •	an airplane or a jet at near idle speed coming for a landing •	No navigational or landing lights •	Not a helicopter •	Not the Space Station in which we sometimes see it fly by •	Smoke cloud. Smoke clouds do not move in that form •	Not a lenticular cloud (see plenty of those at high altitude) I went back out and really looked at the sky and I thought I saw another faint object and it disappeared. That is it and here I'm writting this!;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
i witnessed a rectangle, very bright LED type light looking S/W and est. the distance of 8 miles.  It was huge.  The lights shut off.;2017-05-21 21:41:00;4 minutes;i witnessed a rectangle, very bright LED type light looking S/W and est. the distance of 8 miles.  It was huge.  The lights shut off.  GONE I looked outside my bedroom window in the Arden-Arcade area of Sacramento County at 21:41, looking South West and observed a Red/Orange RECTANGLE, very, very bright LED type light or combination of many lights. I estimate the distance of six to eight miles away and the size of approximately 200 yards wide and 100 yards high.  It was huge!  It appeared to be about 1000 feet in elevation.  It hovered or floated around not moving too much, just up and down a little.  The lights went to bright blueish and shut off, then reappeared back into the bright Red, Orange light, very intense light projection. It drifted South across my sight, same distance and elevation, then shut off.  I videoed it with my tablet, but my tablet only recorded a bluish speck, but I was able to take a screenshot from the video at its most intelligible position.  I blew up the speck so you can almost make out the rectangle shape.  I could see it through my tablet as I was recording it and knew it wasn't recording the same brightness and color, but at least I was able to record its presence. This exact same event took place last year starting on May 13th, 2016, and continued most every night for a week and I also took phone video and pictures with my phone of that event(s). I will attempt to get a better video with my cellphone, although it is not a smart phone, it does record better than my tablet.  I used my tablet because it has way better screenshot and enhancement features.  I will send more reports as I witness them.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
