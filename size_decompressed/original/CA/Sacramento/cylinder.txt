Slowly rotating cylindrical object ~75' above intersection;1973-03-23 17:00:00;20 seconds;Slowly rotating cylindrical object ~75' above intersection As a six year old child I still very clearly remember an incident in March of 1973 outside of my home in Sacramento, CA.   We had just returned home and my parents were inside watching television.  I was outside playing in the street when I felt I was being observed and looked up.  About 50-75 feet (?) above (I will send a Google Street View of the location) I saw a whitish cylindrical object with a few black lines silently hovering above and slowly rotating (Iâ€™ll also email a crude drawing).   I watched it for about 20 seconds, fascinated, when I remembered that I had recently been given a cheap pair of plastic toy binoculars.   Unsure of what I should do, I bolted into the house to get the binoculars so I could see more detail.  I yelled at my parents that there was something in the sky as I ran toward my bedroom.  One of them said that the TV news had reported that a meteor had been spotted.   By the time (2-3 minutes) I made it back outside, the object had d! isappeared.   Even at that age I felt I had seen something very important and decided to write down the date on a piece of paper which I would always keep (of course it only took a couple of months before I lost it!).

While standing ther;2000-10-23 11:00:00;6 minutes;I saw a cylindrical object hanging in mid air while waiting for a bus at Sacramento Airport out side of B terminal. While standing there I looked over the terminal building, and at the 11o'clock position of the sky  I saw a shiny Silver cylindrical object . The object remained in the same position for about 4 - 6 minutes. I thought I was viewing a plane head on, but there were no wings visible and no motion `or movement. I could not tell if it was spinning or just shinning in the bright sun. I got on the bus and could still see it in the same position. I have always thought about this incident as I go through this airport every week at the same time. I read another report on this site describing the same type of event and decided to report this. The incident I am reporting actually happened on Oct 23,2000 at 11:00am;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Shiny cylindrical shaped object seen over Sacramento California;2001-05-30 15:00:00;2-3 minutes;Shiny cylindrical shaped object seen over Sacramento California While enroute to the theater to see  a movie on May 30th, 2001, at 3:00 ppm in the afternoon.My wife and I noticed what I believed to be a commercial jet aircraft. The sky was clear and we were traveling in a westward direction. The object was at about the 11:00 position in a south west direction from our position. Because of my interest and background in Ufology I tend to pay a little more attention to things in the sky then the average individual. I naturally assumed this was a plane ascending from the Sacramento airporrt, and was at such an angle that I could not see it's wings. As we drove for a few blocks the object seemed to hang in the air, which again I assumed that we didn't notice it's movement because we were moving. At that point we made a left turn, proceeding south and the object was now directly in front of us at about the 11:00 position.Being that we had traveled a good distance I and were a a different angle to the object, we should have seen the wings at that point. Having no reference point, I'm going to guess the size of this thing as that of a commercial aircraft as that' what I thought it was in the first place. It was a very shiny metalic and all one color, and cylindrical in shape. Well now as one might imagine, I became very excited, and pulled over to get a good look at this thing. When I did so, my vision was obstructed from some trees, so I got out of the vehicle and walked to the other side of the trees until I had that portion of the sky back in my field of view. The object was gone. Based on the rate of speed this object was traveling, and the length of time we had it in our field of view, if it was a conventional aircraft, we should have still been able to see it. So in conclusion this object was only out of our sight for a few seconds, and would have had to move at an incredible speed to be out of our field of view. I look forward to any news of other witnesses.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Cylinder shape over Sacramento;2009-05-11 20:30:00;5 mins;Cylinder shape over Sacramento Large (but high altitude) dark cylindrical object very high in the sky oriented North-South going toward south first then orienting south-east.  Disappeared after 5 mins.  Too large to be a plane at that altitude (there was a small semi-transparent cloud I used as reference for altitude), and didn't have any blinking light (a plane would have its lights).  No engine-trail behind the object (like a plane usually leaves) and completely disappeared after 5 mins.  The object was directly over Sacramento, a bit towards Roseville.  Should crosscheck with planes schedules anyhow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
