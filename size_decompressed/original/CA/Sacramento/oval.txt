One night, she came running back inside the apartment screaming.  I asked her what was wrong.  She said that a UFO was hovering 200 feet above her head.  I didn’t see anything.  I noticed she was hysterically crying.   I drove her to the Sacramento Sheriff’s Department and they had her use their phone to call an 800 number to call Dr. Allen Hynek of the Chicago, Illinois Bureau of UFO Investigations.  Dr. Hynek sent us some forms to fill out, so she could describe what she saw.  Dr. Hynek later called me and asked what I was doing.  I told him I was watching Dick Van Dyke’s The Comic on TV.  He asked what happened when Helen was screaming outside, I said the TV went on the blink, it displayed static and I was trying to fix the TV, when I heard her screaming.  He told me that when UFOs hover nearby, that they cause disturbances on car engines, TVs and radios.  This was a normal occurrence.  Later I learned that 2 other people in Sacramento saw the same UFO in two different locations and it was reported in the Sacramento Bee. From 1979 to 1986 I was back in the U.S. Army.  This time I joined Military Intelligence and I was stationed at PIC-K (Photo Interpretation Center, Korea).  This time my code name was Hollywood or Joe Hollywood,  I wore a black suit now and I was clean-cut.  I kept the sunglasses though.    My job as a 97 Bravo (Intelligence Analyst) was to work with Image Interpreters in identifying targets in North Korea and Red China, such as T-72 tanks, etc.  I would create what is called a sitmap pinpointing targets discovered by Image Interpreters, that studied reconnaissance aerial photographs.  I would categorize certain photos.  We would go on what is called a ‘hot run’ from Seoul, Korea, (Yongsan Barracks) to Osan Air Force Base.  The vehicle would display a placard that indicated that the vehicle could not be stopped for any reason.  There was a combination lock on the trunk of the vehicle and a combination lock in the suitcase inside the trunk,  the driver and myself would have ½ of the combination to open the trunk and the suitcase.  We would place the hotrolls (film) into the suitcase and head back to Seoul.   During my time as an Intelligence Analyst I categorized 6 photos taken by reconnaissance satellites of what appeared to be UFOs.  The UFOs moved on their own accord, as if they were guided by some kind of intelligence.  Therefore the 6 photos were significant by Military Intelligence.   The photos moved up the intelligence chain from Military Intelligence to DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) to CIA (Central Intelligence Agency).  From there, I don’t know where the photos went.  While at PIC-K, I worked with Air Force Intelligence, Navy Intelligence, DIA, CIA, Marine Recon, US Army (Green Beret) Special Forces, 101st Airborne, US Army Rangers, 82nd Airborne, Delta Force, Navy Seals.  It was necessary for us to work closely with certain elite military groups.    Another strange photo I once saw was given to me to categorize.  It was a photo of an American POW in Vietnam, taken in 1981.  The photo went into a metallic box with a combination lock and disappeared up the intelligence channel.  The spooks (intelligence personnel) I worked with, would never discuss UFOs.  Most spooks belonged to some sort of secret society, most were Freemasons and I was a Rosicrucian.   When I departed Korea, I signed up for the 82nd  Screaming Eagles Airborne and Special Forces training and they were ready to send me to Ft. Gordon, Georgia and Ft. Bragg, North Carolina and I was called to do a special assignment.  I received an H identifier and became an Army instructor and taught the Soviet Threat for OPFOR (Opposing Forces).  I wore a Russian uniform, ski mask, black gloves and talked with a fake Russian accent and called myself Corporal Dowbowski.  I would instruct the Soviet Threat, teaching the W.E.F.T. (Wings, Engine, Fuselage and Tail) on Soviet Aircraft, kill zones on Soviet aircraft and land roaming vehicles, the use of many Soviet weapons from the AK-47 to the SVD Sniper Rifle in which I was proficient.   During my time with OPFOR, I learned from Intelligence circles, that the Russian KGB also knew and were aware of what exactly UFOs were and where they came from. To this day, I don’t know the answers to the UFO mystery, but hopefully one day our Government will disclose what they know to the public.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
transluscent green oval travelling in a straight line heading due north at approximately 10 to15 degrees per second.;2003-08-13 01:00:00;10 seconds;transluscent green oval travelling in a straight line heading due north at approximately 10 to15 degrees per second. One object seen approximately 25-30 degrees above the horizon, taveling apparently due north. Object was first seen when approximately due west and gradually faded from view until it had faded out of site at approximately northwest. The motion of the object was completely smooth, with no visible variation or change in direction - and that was the most remarkable detail about the sighting - it appeared to travel in a completely straight line. It The apparent size of the oject was thumbnail at arms length sized, and its apparent magnitude was about positive 3. It glowed a tranluscent green, brighter around the edges, and slightly dimmer towards the center.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Bright oval shaped object, flameing center, large tail, varying magnitude, moving across sky rapidly.;2003-12-31 21:00:00;10 sec.;Bright oval shaped object, flameing center, large tail, varying magnitude, moving across sky rapidly. I was gazing out towards the East horizon, a large bright object appeared like out of a dark veil from the south - east, at a low altitude, apox. 25 or 30 degrees above the horizon. The object was oval shaped, laying horizontal, it's top side was bright, and bottom side was bright, the center front to back was like a white flame, not as bright as it's top and bottom. A bright comet tail followed the object, apox. ten times the length of the object. The objects diameter was as large as a cargo plane (maybe two or three degrees across, 1.5 degrees from top to bottom). The object traveled from the south east to north east, that is, it changed bearing and from traveling north on the east horizon, to a north-east-north direction. It vanished into another veil of darkness. My estimation of speed is that it traveled perhaps 1000 mp-minute. Based on a apox. est of distance in feet, measured in time traveled. The event lasted about 6 seconds, taking a guess.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

The Object was seen at 22:55 July 31st 2010,  A bright Oval Object directly to the right of the Big Dipper could be seen falling vertically from point of few It fell 6 Inches.  After falling It grew brighter ( Blue ) then flashed an orange white hue and shot directly east at a completely perfect horizontal flight path.  The Object did not appear to be a Aircraft or Shooting star I know the difference,  It was almost like an falling orb than turned into a rocket.  I didn't have time to take a picture of the object due to the fact I was on the cell phone looking up at the Big Dipper.  My friend told me to report It and so thats what I did, hopefully someone else saw what I seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Oval Pattern of Lights Observed Traveling Low Over Sacramento, CA;2010-11-28 22:59:00;45 seconds;Oval Pattern of Lights Observed Traveling Low Over Sacramento, CA An aircraft was just observed over the City of Sacramento,California(in the dark)carrying at least eight steady lights of different colors configured in two equally spaced rows suggesting an oval shape elongated along the horizontal axis.  Other lights were seen to randomly blink within the pattern of the aforementioned  eight steady lights or to blink in an unobserved pattern.  The aircraft made no noise,unlike the helicopters and fixed wing aircraft often seen over this city.  It was traveling in a strait line at similar speeds to local conventional aircraft noted at this relatively low altitude (approximately 500 feet) and was passing due west over 51st Street between J and M Streets toward the state capitol.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Star-like object trailing plane, followed by silver-whitish gray pill object;2016-09-26 11:35:00;15 minutes;Star-like object trailing plane, followed by silver-whitish gray pill object Around 11:35 AM, I went outside to get fresh air,  I looked up toward the west to look at the moon (which was barely visible) and I saw the first object gradually appear.  I started dim like a star then became brighter up to a 4.4, like Venus.  A few seconds after it came into view it started to swing from north to south then started to travel south, very slowly.  I called my mother to view what I was viewing, just to confirm what I was seeing and she saw the same thing too.  I told her to keep an eye on the object while I grab binoculars.   By the time I got back, my mother said it had faded away, I'm assuming it went back up into the atmosphere?  Then a commercial aircraft passed by and then we saw another star trailing the commercial craft - that one was blinking.  I brought up my binoculars to look at the plane and the blinking thing that was trailing it but it and the plane left my view because my house was obstructing my view.  However, in the area where we first ! spotted the blinking thing that was following craft I saw through the binoculars a silver-whitish gray pill.  It looked like it was tumbling to the east then froze, then glided west and then it tumbled up into the atmosphere where it faded away.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
