I looked down the street (south) and observed  what I thought was a butterfly, white in color about a foot off the ground over the gutter heading toward my stepdaughter’s car, (moving north) as it approached rapidly I noticed that it was a very bright white ball of light (defused) about the size of a cotton ball no light scatter.  It then hit the rear right tire and disappeared .. End of report.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Luminescent Egg Shaped Object in Sky on SW Flight;2016-03-26 14:25:00;2.5 minutes;Luminescent Egg Shaped Object in Sky on SW Flight On March 26, 2016, my husband and I were flying on Southwest Flight 4124 departing from Sacramento, California to San Diego.  We left Sacramento at 1:50 pm to our final destination, Tucson, Arizona. I sat next to the window near the wing.  I was looking out the window to view the snow covered mountains below.  The pilot announced that we were approximately 8 miles up and flying at 39,000 feet.  It was approximately 2:25 pm, I noticed in the distance, a very long, thin, black plume of what appeared to be smoke in the relatively clear blue sky.  At first glance, I thought I was looking at black birds flying in formation.  I asked my husband to take a look and asked him what he thought it was.  He said he didn’t know.  I looked again and saw a brilliant, mirror-like chrome, egg shaped object with, seamless, smooth round edges.  It appeared close, possibly within 2500 feet of the plane but due to perspective differences it could have been much further away.  In comparison to the left wing of the plane, the object took up almost three fourths of the wing.  As it moved, the top of the egg shaped object became visible.  The top was a bright white with a luminosity similar to a ! welding arc.  The top area had an extremely bright white luminescence with what appeared to be white flames in the center portion. My husband looked at this and said he did not know what it was, but believed it was not a plane nor a rocket.  He further stated that it was way too close to the plane to be a launched rocket out of a military air base. After approximately 2 to 2.5 minutes, it then disappeared from view. No one else in the plane appeared to observe it, as many were preoccupied—with shades drawn, sleeping, reading, etc.  My husband later looked on the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) site in the incident/accident report section and found no report of such an object or a rocket launch in the vicinity of our flight path.  A drawing of the object will be mailed to the PO Box listed on your internet site. My background is Nursing and Public Health.  My husband is a retired public school superintendent who teaches School Law and various graduate education courses.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
