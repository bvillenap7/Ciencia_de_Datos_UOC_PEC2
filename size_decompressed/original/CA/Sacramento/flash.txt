She saw a greenish blue streak falling in the eastern sky.  She said it disappeared for a second then turned white then it was gone.  I turned the car around (I had not seen this).  In the area where she said it fell there were helicopters and small aircraft circling the area, and a large cloud of smoke rising from the ground.  We went in search of this area but couldn't find it as when we got off the highway buildings, trees, and growing dusk obscured any view of the smoke we would have had.  Interesting note, there has been no mention of any sort of crash, explosion, or any other catastrophe that would explain the smoke and air vehicles in the area;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Blinking star.;2004-08-10 22:30:00;90 seconds;Blinking star. I was in my backyard at 10:30pm. I noticed a blinking light very high up in the Northern sky. It blinked 4 or 5 times while I watched and then stopped blinking. The intervals between blinks was about 3 or 4 seconds. I thought it might be a plane at first (planes and helicopters are always flying above where I live). I was thinking that maybe the blinking was actually a plane headlight and the light was bouncing back from some thick clouds or smog which would give me the illusion that it was a blinking light. But the light never moved the whole time I watched and it was completely quiet and clear outside. No sound of a plane at all. It stayed in the original point I first found it in the entire time. When it stopped blinking I couldn't help but stare intently at the location it had been in. I stared for what was probably 20 seconds at that exact spot. Then, from exactly that point in the sky, I saw the largest, brightest most colorful shooting stars I have ever seen. The trail covered 1/3 of the sky as it shot past and the head of this thing was bright reddish colored and the red color appeared to be lining the sides of the outer edge of the front of the trail. It was stunning. I admit that this blinking light could have been anything and the shooting star could just be a tremendous coincendence. Personally, I have never witnessed anything quite like it but it would be great to find out what it could have been.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Small miniture light very high for 5 seconds. Then vanished upward;2008-02-16 23:00:00;5 seconds;Small miniture light very high for 5 seconds. Then vanished upward Not a cloudy day. A small light appeared to come down for about 5 seconds then it went slowly upward, and dissappeared. Appeared to be like a small light. I know for shure it was not a aiprlane, beacuse it was to high and it eleveted upward then vanished. I just mentioned a word abot UFo to my brother, and it happened 5 minutes afterward.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Flashing/colorful hovering light;2009-01-18 19:45:00;hour+ (still occuring);Flashing/colorful hovering light Tonight, me and my boyfriend video taped what seemed to be an unexplainable object in the sky. There is a strange flashing light hovering and changing colors. It is in the sky still as we speak. Has moved slightly from where it was when me and my boyfriend first saw it. I thought there were two other, less bright blinking lights that created a triangle shape with the main light. These two did not show on my video, however the main light and its movement are pretty clear. I've uploaded them on youtube tonight and am trying to figure out what to do with this.  Here are the links to my videos: First take: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXiATVZKyCI  Second take: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_jYuqiXLeU  Thank you;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Large ball of light with long trail lights up the sky and disappears over Sacramento, California.;2015-10-22 08:00:00;08:00 PM;Large ball of light with long trail lights up the sky and disappears over Sacramento, California. Around 8:00 PM, I was sitting in my backyard on my swinging couch having a cigarette and looking in the at the stars in the sky in the east direction. I noticed a large ball of light with a long trail moving laterally in the south direction at high speed.  Then all of a sudden everything disappeared within a few seconds.  I heard people on the radio early this morning here in the California central valley describe on-air exactly what I had seen.

I saw some white flashing lights, but I noticed one of them looked like a circular shaped building. ((anonymous report));2019-06-18 01:50:00;It has been flying around;I saw some white flashing lights, but I noticed one of them looked like a circular shaped building.  It had white, green, and red lights.  It kept moving around, but stayed in the area. We heard a sound at first, but the sound disappeared until we heard a sound that it bumped into something.  That's when both of my cats seemed startled. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
