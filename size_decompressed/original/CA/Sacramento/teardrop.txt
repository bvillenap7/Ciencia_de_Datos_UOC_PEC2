Strange light in the shape of a teardrop, slightly orange in color;2005-12-27 01:47:00;15 seconds;Strange light in the shape of a teardrop, slightly orange in color I lying in my hammock in my backyard at approximately 1:47 on December 26th.  It was raining very lightly, but just below the cloud cover I saw a strange orange-ish light in the shape of a teardrop.  Now, I thought this was very odd, because while there is a small airport near my house, it was a cloudy night and I couldn't imagine any small plane flying that early in the morning in such poor weather.  The light wasn't moving, and I watched it for about 15 seconds before I ran inside to grab my video camera.  It took me about 3 minutes to prepare the camera inside, and by the time I came back outside, the rain had intensified and the light was gone.  I could hear no distinct noise from it, and had no strange feelings or emotions during or after the incident (other than excitement, obviously).  I am convinced it was a UFO.

Very fast moving, dark grey teardrop-shaped object flies over Sacramento CA.;2007-01-07 16:34:00;<1 second;Very fast moving, dark grey teardrop-shaped object flies over Sacramento CA. While I was on the front porch having a smoke, I saw a large (~2 adult male thumbnails held at arm's length) dark grey, teardrop-shaped object fly overhead VERY quickly from west to east. It wasn't jet black it was a dark grey in color and it moved *VERY* rapidly - I only saw it for perhaps 200ms (0.2 second) from the time it emerged from the limb of the roof of a neighbouring structure, crossed what little sky I could see overhead, and disappeared past the roof of the structure I was on the porch of.  There was an aircraft in the area (I could hear the engines), but it was travelling in a south-to-north trajectory at the time.  Conditions were mostly clear skies, and a temperature of 55Â°F at the time.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
