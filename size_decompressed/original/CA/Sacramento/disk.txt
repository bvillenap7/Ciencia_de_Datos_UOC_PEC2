Light from bottom center. light from square ports 10 ft. by 10 ft. I was on active duty in the U.S.A.F.. I was stationed at Mather A.F.B.. Sacremento, CA. My rank was sargeant. My specialty, Aircraft crewchief. My security clearance was secret. The exact date was approximately June 15,1975. The reason I say this is because the movie Jaws had just came out at Drive-ins and Theatres. I was double-dating with a friend of mine and we decided to go to the drive-in to see Jaws. The Drive-in had Four Screens which were positioned North & South, East & West. My friends and I were waiting for the movie to start, we were facing the East Screen. The Sun was beginning to set below the Horizon which at that time the movie that was playing on the West Screen started. I had turned around in the car and was watching it when I noticed a bright object approximately 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon, West by Southwest. I thought to myself that it was a bright star. I watched it thinking to myself that this was kind of odd because it was still light. I watched it and it began to move at a high speed from West to East. I thought I was possibly watching a SR-71 aircraft from Beale A.F.B. stationed at Marysville, CA. and it was in full afterburner and this was why it was moving so fast. At the time I knew the SR-71 was a Mach 3 Or Mach 5 acft. I told my friend ((name deleted)) to check this out. As we were watching it, it stopped suddenly and turned 90 degrees North toward us. It came straight toward us and hoverd 300 feet above and than dropped behind the Eest screen. People got out of their vehicles and watched in amazement. It raised up behind the screen to about 600 feet and traveled north at an incredible speed. No Sound!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

And at that time is when the object was moving slowly and moved and the sun light move off of it and thats when their it was a sauser disk spening and wobbling over my neiborhood.And i know i could not have been the only one to see this but never heard anyone else that day on TV or radio mention the incedent.  And it was not a plane because all planes were grounded for days,so i know it was not that.Also i! was not that far from it I mean it was right their clear as day showing it self to me and how ever else may have seen it.  So why do you think they showed their self the day after 9/11.  I think it was to say we did this, and were in charge and thers nothing us humans can do.

Early morning about 0730am while taking my kids too school,I notice out of my front window,a shining ball of light but not relly light.You know when something is reflecting off sunlight it looks differnt then a regular light.So what ever it was i new right thier and then it was something differnt then just a air plane light or anything related to that.So I slowed down and observed this light and notice it was just hovering,but rotating or moving in some slow motion,because the shining reflection off the sun was going in and out,like shifting side too side.And when this happen you could see at times,the dark metallic color and shape of this object.And from where this ufo was hovering,it must have been over a gruop of houses,which made it so strange becasue it wasnt relly high for people not to see it.

Prior to making a left hand turn on Franklin Blvd, at a red light, She noted that many witnesses were on the sidewalk pointing their fingers in the sky , Yelling UFO, UFO....  My wife then looked up into the sky....(She was heading westboutnd on Florin Road). As she looked up towards the sky (western hemisphere) she claims to have witnessed two silver shaped dishes.  The dishes hovered for about 2 or 3 minutes before disappearing before her eyes.

I captured on camera, a UFO flying over the state Capitol in Sacramento Ca.;2004-06-05 20:42:00;20:44;I captured on camera, a UFO flying over the state Capitol in Sacramento Ca. The photos that I am sending to Washington are extremely controversial. I shot them on June 5th 2004 in Sacramento at the State Capitol. The photos are historical for several reasons. June 5th 2004 is the day an American President died. Secondly the photos show that the flags at the State Capitol are flying at half mast. Thirdlyâ€¦the photos are rare in that only less than a handful were shot between 8PM through 9PM on the date specified (6/5/2004). Although I losely use the term that less than three people  were shooting photos on the north side of the Capitol. This is not an assumption on my part. This is a fact. History will demonstrate that fact. A UFO perhaps a mile above ground level hovered over the state capitol while I was aiming up at the dome, or rotunda. I've got GREAT digital photos of the event. These photos are HISTORICAL! ((NUFORC Note:  We have not received the photo yet.  We will assess their merits, when they arrive at our Center.  PD));38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Alien probe/craft sighted above rolling hills in California;2008-06-06 16:00:00;One Minute;Alien probe/craft sighted above rolling hills in California This was my first sighting. I've always heard stories and seen video's but seeing it for myself was an entirely different experience. We were driving to San Francisco and we had just passed a power plant and looking over rolling hills.  The sky was a clear blue, no clouds on a bright afternoon. I was looking out the window and into the sky, I saw something shinny which I thought might be the sun reflecting on it, but it was far too bright and then I thought it was a plane because of the shape but it had no wings, so I was confused, before I could say anything, and in the blink of an eye it disappeared. Again I stared in shock and searched the sky, knowing a plane couldn't move that fast to get out of my line of sight in the blink of an eye. So then I realized what I had just seen. A friend of mine took my description and searched, finding this video for me to see and it's Exactly what I had seen. Whether it was the same craft? I don't know. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pAoDcXBrmY&feature=related;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
They flew over Sacramento City College before I viewed them and traveled north.;2008-08-12 22:30:00;3-4 minutes;They flew over Sacramento City College before I viewed them and traveled north. I was outside a popular coffee shop next to Sacramento City College on Freeport Blvd.  I was enjoying a cigarette and admiring the stucco design above the shop.  All of a sudden, a large silver disc flew over my head directly above me at slow speed!  I was startled at the appearance so close to me.  Just as I had a complete view of the craft another appeared! Then another and a fourth!  They were in a diagonal formation from right to left, the first to the right and the rest to the left.  They were scorched on the surface from heat of entry to our atmosphere.  This gave them a light and dark silver appearance!  There was no sound, no lights, no spinning!  They were about 50 feet in diameter and about 12 feet apart!  I thought of jumping in my car to follow them, but I was worried about having an accident!  I was shaking all over and the streets have cars parked on both sides making it difficult to look up and drive.  I watched for several minutes until they were out of s!ight.  They moved at about running speed on the ground say 6 mph.  Called MUFON about six months later and made this same report.  No one in the coffee shop seemed to believe me.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Fast white light in Sacramento sky off of Interstate-5;2011-05-09 09:35:00;1-2 minutes;Fast white light in Sacramento sky off of Interstate-5 I was driving on Interstate-5 South, when on the left hand-side of the free way, on the southern horizon, I noticed  a bright light speeding diagonally downward across the horizon reaching very low to the ground.  (At first I thought the object to be a shooting star, or crashing plane) It then shot back in the direction it came from (now upwards and to the left diagonal), however this time in a big spiral motion.   The object then changed direction completely, flying towards me and past me on the left-hand side, at very fast speeds.  It appeared to be flying at a distance of 200 yards away, and varying from 100-300 ft high.  It seemed to change speeds from very slow to very fast, and once it past me, it had blinking lights on the back (red blue and white).   The object changed direction again, tracing its path to in front of me, and then flying along the horizon, where it split into two white lights.  The (seemingly) original light came back my way, while the ! new second light trailed off to the right and disappeared.   Once the light was so far behind me, I could no longer track its flight pattern. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I look toward my picture window in my living room at approximately 10:38 pm and saw a flying object about the size of a dime (held at arms length) flying through the sky.  It caught my attention because it was so beautiful, the colors were white, red, blue and yellow, but it was spinning clockwise and it flew so fast the I only saw it for about 3 seconds and it was out of sight, then I heard a noise like the sound of a jet--but it was not jet. My window faces North, but the object came across from a easterly direction.  I felt compelled to run to the window to see it as it went by, but it was gone before I could move.  I am on the 5th floor of a 9-story apartment building and my window is even with the tops of most trees.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Video footage of a disk like object in the Sacramento night sky.;2012-08-24 20:00:00;5 minutes;Video footage of a disk like object in the Sacramento night sky. The event happened about 9pm on Friday August 24th. I saw a glowing orb in the sky from the corner of my eye, that at first glance, thought was a shooting star. When I turned and looked I noticed it was moving way too slow to be a shooting star, yet too fast to be a plane. The object, to the naked eye looked like an orb. I ran and got my neighbor to get his video camera out. Upon zooming in on the object you can clearly see a disk like object. It moved in a straight line across the sky, then disappeared. Then about 30 minutes later I saw the same object take off out into the sky in the same place that I had originally saw it appear. I live near an airport and I have seen many aircraft in the night sky, this was definitely not an airplane.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
