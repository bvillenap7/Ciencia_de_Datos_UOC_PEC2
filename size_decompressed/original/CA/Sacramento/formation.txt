A glowing, moving line, going from W to E, which when observed thru binoculars resolved into disks.;1985-11-13 20:00:00;2 minutes;A glowing, moving line, going from W to E, which when observed thru binoculars resolved into disks. On or about Nov. 13, 1985, I was laying down on the front lawn, watching for the annual Leonids. The night was moderately clear, with enough light pollution to limit stars to the top two thirds of the sky.  Around 7 or 8 pm, about three quarters up the sky in the west (coming to view above the tree) my attention was drawn by what appeared to be a white, glowing line, shaped as follows...  _____     _____________ \   / \ / ` ...in reality, the line was a solid. My drawing is also pointing the wrong way - please rotate the figure one quarter turn counterclockwise.  The v portion pointed westwards.  It was moving soundlessly and in a smooth manner similar to that of a satellite, although slightly faster. It was about a half to a full degree in size from one end to the other, or a bit larger than the full moon when viewed normally.  I had reasonably powerful binoculars on hand (strong enough to view the major moons of Jupiter easily) and through these the line resolved into individual circles or disks, flying very closely together and never altering formation in the slightest.  There were about 15 of them all told - about 4 on the short end, three on each side of the v and about another 7 or 8 on the long end.  They were not attached to each other, but were closely spaced enough to appear a glowing line from the ground. They were white in the center, fading to a fuzzy, blue white on the edges. Focusing them sharply proved impossible.  The line continued eastward and passed from view.  It took about a minute to a minute and a half to cross my sky.  I do not pretend to know what it was, but I am now, in these first few days of 2008, 36 years old, and have been avidly looking up for at least 30 of those years.  I was young when I saw this, only 14 or so, but was a very experienced skywatcher even then. Night after night after night of gazing has shown me thousands of satellites, endless airplanes and helicopters, beautiful meteors and startled birds lit by the lights below them. I have never seen anything like this again, before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
cloaked stingray shaped object lowflying only saw moisture build up around front end of object;2006-03-31 22:30:00;5 seconds;cloaked stingray shaped object lowflying only saw moisture build up around front end of object my wife saw it first as we layed down to sleep, out the window about 800ft up, moving about the speed of the police choppers when they circle. the object itself was completely invisible but there was a lot of moisture in the air and we could see a build up of moisture around the front end and what appeared to be some sort of tail piece. the only way i can describe the form that the moisture was contouring to is like that of a sting ray. very flat and smooth edges, almost flowingthrough the air, the sides were like the sides of a sting ray in movement flowing from where they met a somewhat of a center area in a wavelike motion out to the tips of them. the area trailing the front arch of moisture seemed to flow in the same pattern but horizontally as opposed to vertical flowing of the front wing like area. I DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT JUST THE MOISTURE BUILDING UP IN THE AREAS IT WOULD OF ANY KNOWN FLYING OBJECT. i would not have believed my wife had i not seen it my self, it was very brief but unquestionably clear. no lights or sounds or abductions or cell phone static, it seemd to be a perfectly cloaked device using motion for propeltion as opposed to a fuel source. im still having trouble believing it but this was no known object to me and it was undoubtably clear.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

I have 25 pictues of the Lunar Moon UFO formation taking in 15 minute intervals of differet formations aligning the Luunar moon. It as very cloudy that night and I went to capture history due to the Solar Eclipse being ten days before.

I went to capture the Lunar Moon on camera. i wanted to capture history as the Solar Eclipse had been ten days before and the Venus transit due the next day. It was cloudy that morning and all I could see was the Lunar Moon without stars,  As I began to take photos I saw these other lights in formation beside the moon. I took the camera down to see f I could see them with the naked eye and could not. I have 25 pictures from that night taken in fifteen minute untervals.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Orange lights in the sky over Sacramento, CA.;2013-09-22 20:20:00;10 minutes;Orange lights in the sky over Sacramento, CA. While driving to work on the above  date, I saw  approximately 20 orange dots in the sky. I was driving westbound on Auburn Blvd near Norris.  The  orange dots were low in the sky and not in any uniform formation.  I immediately called my mother and she in turn called a friend. All 3 of us saw the same same thing from 3 different locations within Sacramento , CA. I have been going over all of the possibilities in my head as to what t this could have been. h Te sun had already set and there was no sunset after glow.  We do have an airport, but even if it was planes lining up to land, they would be moving and not that close together. Maybe it was Chinese lanterns for a soltice celebration?  Did our local military drop flares from an aircraft?? One of the orange dots actually started to fall to the ground.  It turned white in color and stopped falling and hovered in place. All of the other orange dots stayed in place.  One of the dots had 2 smaller dots that moved erratically around it in very close proximity.  When I finally got work I could no longer see the dots in the sky.  On my way to work, I had to make a turn onto another street going southbound and that is when I lost sight of the dots.  My mother and her friend both kept watching them. I saw a helicopter, possibly local law enforcement or the news, travel at a high rate of speed towards the dots.  My mothers friend said she saw a plane approach the dots and they just went away. I don't know if they flew off or just vanished.  I will try to get clarification. Here are some final thoughts: I drive a sports car, which means it sits very low and the windshield has a limited view.  These dots were not that high up, but not ground level either.  My mothers friend lives near the Capital City Freeway (business 80] and Cal Expo. This means there is a lot of light pollution, and these things were very visible in the sky to her.  I have looked online at the local news sites, nothing is mentioned.  I even looked at the airport website, no mention of any major events that would require 20 planes to be in the area.  There were about 6 planes that landed in the time frame this took place.  I don't know where else to look for answers. I am trying to be logical, but this just baffles me.  If it was actual alien UFOs, awesome, if not, then ok, but what was it?  Curiosity is killing this cat. Thank you for your time and energy.

Fleet of silver UFO trio fly north at high speed.;2014-02-01 15:30:00;45 seconds;Fleet of silver UFO trio fly north at high speed. I am filing a report for my wife since she is a new United States Citizen, so is unfamiliar to this organization to report a sighting herself.  She stated that on February 1, of 2014, there was a faintly visible fleet of 3 silvery objects traveling in triangular-shaped formation heading north at high speed.   She stated that there was clearly 3 separate object rather than 1 since they all had a random drift pattern in flight.  No lights or sound were noticed while she watched, these objects move in a direct path in the daylight sky.  She was only able to see these after noticing a plane flying close to the area of the sighting.  After viewing the trio of UFOs she said there appeared to be a military-type plane that followed (after the objects left) the same direction the craft went, only moving slower.  Perhaps classified Air Force surveillance?;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Star-like lights moving at the speed of jets ft 5-6 bright red lights descending into space.;2014-08-24 20:00:00;10 minutes;Star-like lights moving at the speed of jets ft 5-6 bright red lights descending into space. It was red, very big lights at first but it looked as if they were descending into space.  There was 4-5 or 5-6 of them, all in formation.  One by one they were fading into black.   As soon as one of them were pitch black, you can start seeing star-like lights moving really fast.  Not the speed of light but the speed of a jet & remember the look on the moving lights were star-like so they were really really small, meaning they were really really far.  Jets, or private jets any type of planes have flashing LIGHTS.  These were just bright.  No flash at all.   I hope the news tells us whats going on.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
