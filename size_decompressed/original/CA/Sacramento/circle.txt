I work for a local phone company on the night shift. I went outside to see the Leonid meteors at 4:30 am pst. About 04:35 pst I saw what looked like a large star in the south sky start to move, thought it was maybe a plane but then it rose up and shot off to the south and up (at a very high rate of speed). It was white like a star but as it zoomed away it's color seemed to shift towards yellow or light red.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Streaker, rod like or meteor like thing moving fast against wind;2000-11-06 14:00:00;Short;Streaker, rod like or meteor like thing moving fast against wind What Wazzit? As I was driving on 80 East out of Sacramento, I saw something interesting. I was approaching the Fulton exit, less than a half a mile away, and it was about 2 o’clock in the afternoon. Weather was mostly blue sky, with a heavy wind gusting from left to right. I saw what appeared to be a metallic object with a tail, at about 10 o’clock elevation and about 2 o’clock to my right. It was moving right to left at one hellacious speed, and the tail seemed to flicker. The object was about half of a pencil eraser diameter at arms length, just enough size to make me think it was probably round, and the tail was about 1/2 to 1 hour of arc, trailing behind it. It only was visible for about half a second, and just when it was about to go over the highway, it seemed to disappear. I have no idea how big it was, or how far it was away. I think it was less than 1,000 feet from me, and less than 200 feet in altitude, but I am not sure. If it was farther away than that, it would have had to be really moving! I tried to fit it into some familiar object, and could not. It was not a balloon, because it going against the wind at a high speed. I don’t think it was a stunt kite, because there is no place to fly one in that area, as far as I know, and because it went in a straight line. It did not reverse direction or stop as a kite would have to do. (I fly them myself, and it definitely didn’t move the way a kite does.) Airplane or helicopter, no way. It did not resemble one in either appearance or the way it flew. As for a meteor, I have never seen one in broad daylight, and this object seemed to have more size than that. Also, every meteor I have seen has been going almost straight down, and I have only seen them at a much higher angle of elevation, while looking up, not straight ahead. The nearest thing I can fit it with is a “rod” which I have read about a few times on various web sites, but I am not sure about that either. I don’t think it fits any of the classical descriptions of “flying saucers” or any kind of alien space craft, unless it was moving at a truly incredible speed, or was less than 3 feet in diameter. They usually don’t have tails, as far as I have heard. Don’t know...just a curious thing. If there are aliens, I wish they would fly things around here, it’s kind of boring in Sacramento, most of the time. I never thought I would be sending you one of these things. Contact me only if others reported it. Otherwise why bother? Not a strong sighting.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Big Bouncing Light;2001-01-01 01:00:00;10 SECONDS;Myself and my sister-in-law where heading back home after being out for the night, on Highway 99 heading towards Elk Grove.  I saw an enormous bounging (light) heading towards us. (It stayed on the freeway) bouncing up and down and shot straight into the sky and disappeared.  I then looked over to my sister-in-law and she was staring back at me and I asked her if she just saw what I had seen.  She said yes a big bouncing light. (as big as the width of the freeway). A little bigger and huge. I dont really believe in UFO but this I can not explain and wanted to take it off my chest.  Thankx ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Four, extremely bright orange circles in the sky catch my attention;2002-10-30 02:15:00;1-2 minutes;Four, extremely bright orange circles in the sky catch my attention I saw four extremely bright orange objects in the sky. They hung in the sky in a vertical line and the one at the bottom was veering off to the right in a very slow motion.  The other three (on top) were not moving at all except that they were twinkling like crazy. I really have to stress how bright these objects were. They looked like little balls of orange glitter being hit with a very bright sun. I've never seen anything like it--nothing that bright. I watched these objects for maybe 60 seconds before I ran into the house to awaken my husband. I didn't even think to grab the video camera which is just as well because by the time we got out there, they were gone.  I ran out into our street in hopes of seeing them from a different angle but I saw nothing. They were gone that quick. Anyway, I wanted to at least share what I saw because maybe someone out there saw them too.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

The object moved back and forth at a fairly good speed, much faster than we drove which was about 70 miles an hour.  The object was multiple colors, at times all blue with a few white lights, sometimes mostly red.  We could also see the shadow of the body which was disk like.  As we continued to drive I watched through the back window with my 11 year old son.  We noticed it jet straight up in the air and then drop like a rock toward the ground before stoping and then moving in other directions.  We continued to watch for about 5 minutes until it was out of view.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

I was driving on I-80 East approaching West Sacramento at approximately 10:30 p.m. A  large, circular, bright, white light appeared in the sky in front of my car. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed and disappeared into thin air. I saw it through very top of my windshield. The sky was clear and there were no other objects in sight. It was much too low to be a plane. It was not a shooting star. It was visable for maybe 2 seconds. I had the window down in my car, the object emitted no sounds that I could hear. My friend was following me in his car. We were returning from Santa Rosa and had been in transit for about two hours. My friend was at a distance of approximately a half mile behind me, so he viewed the object from further away than I saw it. The object passed just within my vision. If it had been a second later, it would have been directly above my car or behind me and I would not have seen it. When we arrived home in Applegate about 45 minutes later, I told my friend that I had seen something in the sky. He said he had also witnessed the object and described it exactly as I had seen it, except he had viewed it from further away. We are both in awe and have never seen anything like it before.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Initially, they were close together and hovering completely silent.  One was orange-red and the other yellow-white.   These lights did not pulse like aircraft anti-collision lights.   After my initial shock, I was able to take some poor quality video with my phone starting 10:25:59 and running 45 seconds.   The orbs separated and flew away – south for the orange-red orb and southwest for the yellow-white orb – at a moderate speed.   After a few seconds, the lights “winked” out.

Me and my fiancé ages 21 and 27 were chatting up late when my wife askef me what these lights are.  At 1st glance i thought plane but as i watched the pulsating red green and white light i noticed it seemed stationary.  Hovering around Orion's belt.  As i went out onto the porch i noticed another pulsing red green and white light about 40° to the east but further away.  When i got downstairs to the street, a T intersection in which i can see down the vertical section of the T, i noticed a third green and red pulsing light that appeared much closer and more vibrant. It was low in the sky about even with roof tops about a block away.i felt almost like on the red pulse that a Laser pointer was hitting me but i could see no discernable light in my vicinity. I turned to yell to my wife asking if she could see or feel the same sensation as me. She had gone inside to find a camera when i turned back after no more than three seconds had elapsed the light direct in fron! t of me had vanished.

The three objects came to a dead stop, then shot out to the stars  about five times faster than what they were originally traveling and disappeared.   About two weeks later, I was laying on the back deck at about 1 o'clock am, when I was awoken to a extremely bright light, to the point where I had to shade my eyes from being burned.  The bright light lasted for about  30 seconds, then completely shut off.   The following day it felt as though I had severe sunburn  to my skin and my eyes were painful from what I had experienced.   There was nothing remotely  possible of duplicating this light on either my house or my neighbor's house.  To this very day I have told only a few people, and I still am baffled from what I have seen and experienced in both occasions. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.

Dozens of bright orange circular lights.;2017-11-14 20:00:00;2 minutes;Dozens of bright orange circular lights Just after 8:00pm Pacific time, I was walking to my car, when I noticed a bright stationary orange ball of light.  It stayed in one spot for approximately 30 seconds.   I ran inside to get my wife and kids.  They came out and were able to see the light briefly before it seemed to just disappear out of existence.  I just thought it was a little weird but nothing more.  I got into my car, went to grab some groceries about a mile from the house.   About 10 minutes after the original sighting, I was able to see an estimated 20-30 bright orange lights in the exact same area!  Almost in the shape of a flower petal, stretching maybe across 2 miles of sky.  I flew into the driveway honking.  My family ran out. Unfortunately, my wife and kids only saw the last 2 bright orange balls “blink”out of existence for about 10 seconds and then they were gone.   Within a minute there were 2 airplanes circling the area where we had seen the odd lights. We hopped in the car to get out of the suburb lights and chase what we saw.  They did not appear in any capacity again.  For the record I’m a huge skeptic when it comes to any type of UFO talk.
