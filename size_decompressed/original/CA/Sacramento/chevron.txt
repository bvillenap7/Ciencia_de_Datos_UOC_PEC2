It looks like a string of star-like lights.  I don't know what it was, but I did know one thing for sure when it was happening, honestly I was thanking God for a beautiful sky with full of stars.  I am still wondering about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
