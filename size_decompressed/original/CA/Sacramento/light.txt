I WAS WORKING AS A SECURITY GUARD FOR A APARTMENT COMPLEX IN SACRAMENTO CA. I WAS ON PATROL OF THE GROUNDS WHEN I NOTICED THIS LIGHT IN THE SKY HEADING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH, AT FIRST I DID NOT GIVE IT MUCH THOUGHT BECAUSE THERE WAS ALOT OF AIR TRAFFIC DUE TO AN AIR FORCE BASE TO THE NORTH AND FROM SOUTH TO NORTH WAS PART OF THIER APPROACH TO LAND. BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE AIRCRAFT THAT I WOULD SEE ON A DAILY BASIS. THIS HAD NO RUNNING OR FLASHING LIGHTS LIKE AND AIRPLANE. IT WAS JUST A YELLOWISH ORANGE PULSING LIGHT THAT WAS MOVING LAZILY THROUGH THE SKY AND THEN STARTED TO HOVER. BY THIS TIME A FEW RESIDENTS NOTICED ME LOOKING AT THE SKY, AND OBSERVED THE SAME THING. WE WATCHED IT FOR APROXIMATLY 15 MINUITES AND THEN IT SUDDENLY SHOT SRTAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY UNTIL WE COULD NO LONGER SEE IT.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

I woke up to the sound of my dog barking, and by the sound of her bark i could tell I needed to see what was going on.  When I opened the door and told her to stop barking, i saw that she was up by our fence and looking up.  I walked towards my dog and looked up when I saw the object. What I saw was a bright, stationary light about 30 to 40 feet in the air, and over my neighbors yard, about 5 houses away.  This light would pulsate and flash brighter, almost like a strobe light, but much slower, about one pulse every 2 or 3 seconds.  It was completely silent, and just pulsed every few seconds.

When the object flew over my head there was no sound at all. There lights would flash all different directions and then there would be two lights that would flash at the same time. I was driving down Amercian River Drive when i saw two lights flash. Then there was one flash afther the other all over. The objsct moved all differnet ways. After the lights would flash all over there would be two lights flash at the same time. I could not make an outline of the object but the lights were flashing to fast for it to be a plaine. The object did not make any nosie when it flew over, but it moved all over the sky every rapidly. I have never seen anything like it.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

It traversed the sky from directly in front of me to the horizon in approx. 4-5 seconds. It did not burn and break up like a meteor, nor did it have any other lights around it like aircraft recognition lights. It moved in a straight line like a satellite, but was travelling much to fast.

Two Star-like lights seen in East Sacramento;1999-06-26 20:20:00;2-3 minutes;Two Star-like lights seen in East Sacramento My family and I had gone to a local video store to rent some movies. There was a long check-out line, so my husband took our daughter with him on a short errand. As he left, he told me that he would pick me up outside the store after I checked out. When I got through the line, I went outside to wait for my husband. I didn't see him immediately, so I just stood, looking around as I waited. I looked up at the sky and noticed two bright star-like lights travelling upward high up over the parking lot. Each of them had a single white contrail that trailed behind them as they soared upward. I thought they were a jet at first,but I couldn't see a body around them. Then I noticed they were flying sort of neck-and-neck as though they were racing each other. After I had been staring up at the sky for a few moments, I could see the security guard looking up as well. I don't really know what he thought, but he appeared to be looking in the same direction as I. When my husband drove up, I told him what I saw. I told him to park in a parking space and look. Unfortunately, by then all that was visible was a jet, which was flying in a different direction. Unlike the lights, I could see the white body of the jet airplane as it flew by. By that time,the lights were gone. My husband insisted that what I saw was the jet. He said, Anything that leaves a contrail is a jet. I just thought I'd bring this to your attention, in case someone saw something similiar.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Light seen pulsating from white to completely red then completely orange and back to white seen west of Sacramento;2001-01-27 21:10:00;5-10 MINS;Light seen pulsating from white to completely red then completely orange and back to white seen west of Sacramento It was about 9:00 PM on Saturday.  We were driving westbound Hwy 50 from Mather Air Field. We saw a bright white light, which we thought was an aircraft leaving Sacto. International Airport flying southbound.  This object was not progessing southbound like the many aircraft that we have observed daily. (We live in the flight path of Mather Air Field) The object's light remained bright and round instead of changing as a normal aircraft would as it flys. Once we got home, we got the (10 X 50) binoculars out to observe the object.  The object had moved from the area of the International Airport to (what we can only guess) as the area of West Sacramento. The object was low in the sky and now hovering or stationary.  Two different airplanes, on their normal flight paths from Mather Air Field & Sacto. International Airport were in the sky at the same time.  We compared the object to these aircraft.  Thats when you could really see the difference between the object and the two aircraft.  Both aircraft had easily identifiable flashing navigational lights, the object had no navigational lights of any type.  The object could be described as a round white light which slowly pulsated to completely orange, then completely red and then back to white again.  It slowly decended until it went out of sight.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

This UFO went slow then jumped, seemed to climb in a circular fashion, stopped, zipped fast, stopped, cruised even slower, then went into a straight climb, blinked 3 times and then blinked out. It changed position and rate of speed at least 10 times in the three minutes I watched it. I followed it across about a third of the sky, say 60 degrees(which is alot).

It then quickly shot downward, I immediately thought it was a shooting star.  But it did not fade or fizzle out it stopped and then shot abruptly to the right.  I woke up my husband to witness this amazing craft.  He got his binoculars which allowed us to see that the craft had green and red lights on it. I then woke up our two teenage children to witness this. We are still unable to determine an exact shape, as it is off in the distance.  The craft continued to dart around and continue in a decent downward.  It also has flashes of light that occur the exact same distance around the craft intermittently.  It appears as though it may also be sending off beams of light. I have watched this craft appear in the same area for three nights now.  It appears as though there are other such craft hovering in the sky and not moving, but they have the green and red lets on them as well.  My husband contacted all law enforcement agencies to see if they had heliocopters in the air, and they did not.  He contacted Sacramento International Airport Control Tower, and they said they did not have any planes in the air, but there was something showing up on their radar intermittently.

Fast light approaches me and I shoot 2 Quicktime clips of it passing overhead while driving!;2004-11-25 03:30:00;30 seconds;Fast light approaches me and I shoot 2 Quicktime clips of it passing overhead while driving! While driving home from work early 11-25 at approx 3:30 am PDT, it was partly cloudy with patchy fog that was illuminated by a nearly full moon. I was driving westbound on I-80 freeway and turned off at Truxel Rd and was turning south (left turn), heading back over the freeway. When I straightened out the wheel, from the direction I just came from, I noticed a very bright unusual looking whitish amber colored light up in the sky. I estimate it was maybe 400 to 500 ft up. at about 35 degrees up from the horizon. At about a distance of a mile or so yet down the freeway. My first thought was its just a helicopter flying low over the freeway. Then I looked for the usual blinking marker lights around the big light which didn't look like anything I've seen on a helicopter before. That's when things didn't add up in my estimations of distance and speed and relative size of a chopper. I could pretty much see that the light was too large for a helicopter at that distance and it was closing fast. The light itself was not the usual bright spot light, with its search light spot ray pointing downward. More like it was the entire craft itself. I remembered I had my digital camera with me and realized I could take a picture of this thing. It was in its case and I become really excited as I fumbled with the bag losing precious seconds trying to negotiate a moving vehicle and open my camera case at the same time. I slowed down to maybe 10 mph from about the 20mph that I was up to crossing the overpass. By the time I got my camera out and rolled down my window so as to not get flash reflection, it had caught up to me, I stuck my camera out the window, turned it back behind me and up. I immediately saw the bright light in the view finder screen. Holding the camera with both hands and trying to keep it still I pressed the button but the flash didn't go off as I expected so I just thought it 'misfired' and I pressed again. Neither time did I get a flash. I must have batteries too weak to fire the flash on my camera I thought and then it dawned on me that I didn't hear anything like a helicopter. This thing made No Sound! Then when I got home I pressed review on my camera and to my surprise it started playing back a video of what I saw and was trying to take a picture of. I had inadvertently captured 3 seconds of it in two very short movies of it. It turns out In my haste to get a picture I must have turned the mode selector button on my Kodak CX7300 past camera one notch to Video mode.  Although the video is shaky and brief you can slow it down in Quicktime by manually dragging the playback head back and forth to see the light's path overhead relative to tiny more stationary lights below it. I counted a total 22 frames of the object spread out over two seperate clips in a timeframe of 2.5 to 3 seconds. I actually saw it for almost 30 seconds total. Note that my date on the file is correct the actual right time was never set on my camera.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Some where in the Sierra's on interstate 80 there was a bright light, about 2000ft AGL. Looked to large, bright and still to be an Aircraft(Aircraft lights this close usaully show some transmited vibration). The light projected a flat and fanned-out beam into a cloud. Unlike a head light beam. I thought the cloud was causing this affect. After studying it for about a minute trying to justify it in my mind it then moved to the right and stopped. It dimmed and brightened then disappeared. As it disappeared there was a faint round fog or cloud like that which is generated by a high altitude jet engine but very faint. It formed a ball around where the light  pushing out then rushed slightly into where the light was. The light going out and the cloud forming took about a second. I continued to watch the round cloud and noticed the other could was gone. As I watched the round cloud still trying to rationalize what I saw the round cloud disipated in about 5-7 seconds. It was a clear sky and only some of the brightest stars were still visible.

I was getting really tired and wondered how long I could keep driving before I would have to find a motel and get some sleep.  I was standing by my car looking back towards the freeway when I saw a brilliant intensely blue light falling from the sky.  It moved downward silently at a steady pace.  It was not pinpoint but rather large, perhaps even large enough to be described as a blue orb. I first caught sight of it at about 45 degrees above the horizon. It was so bright that I had no difficulty following it down as it moved behind some trees. It appeared to reach the ground just a few hundred feet away on the west side of the highway. The blue color was significant because it reminded me of the light I had seen over the Sepulveda Pass in September of 92, just a few weeks after Dr. Greer had trained the LA CE-5 Initiative team that I was to coordinate for the next 5 years.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

While out on the back patio having a smoke, I noticed - in the eastern sky - a flashing light. At first, I thought that it was just an ordinary aircraft, but I soon took note that the flashes were *NOT* consistent with any strobe light I've ever seen on an aircraft. The light, colored predominantly white, blinked at a rate of ~1Hz (one blink per second). The light was illuminated for ~500ms and was off for another ~500ms. The flashes were evenly spaced never erratic. It also hung stationary in the air for approximately 35 seconds, then suddenly began to slowly move off until it was obscured by nearby trees approximately ten seconds later. While in the process of moving off, it also appeared to dim somewhat as it (apparently) receded. There was no engine noise evident - at the apparent distance it was, I would have probably heard engine noise if it had (a) conventional engine(s). Because of its flashing and movement patterns, I can safely discount astronomical bodies like planets, stars, or meteors.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

I observed it for approximately 30 seconds it exhibited no movement or change in intensity, and it twinkled slightly.  So I shot at it with a violet laser (power output 111.9mW and spectrographically measured wavelength of ~407.5nm).  After shooting at it intermittently for ~10 seconds, the light started to diminish, until ~5 seconds later it had totally extinguished. I discounted phosphenes pretty much at once because the light remained in a fixed position in the sky when my eyes were moved, and discounted a terrestrial aircraft for the same reason, and because no strobes were seen (I would have certainly *NOT* hosed it down with a laser if I had even the slightest suspicion that it was an aircraft!). Conditions at the time of this sighting were clear skies, calm winds, and a temperature of 47°F (8.33°C).;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Small point of light moving at high speed and high altitude in a northerly direction across the sky.;2009-07-03 21:25:00;10-15 seconds;Small point of light moving at high speed and high altitude in a northerly direction across the sky. I was using binoculars to look at Antares in the southern sky.  Without the binoculars I started looking to the east when I spotted a very small white dot moving south to north.  I quickly found the point of light with my binoculars and noticed that is was steady white with no colored or blinking lights.  I watched the light, without the binoculars, until it went out of view behind a tree.   It seemed to be at a very high altitude, very far away and moving very fast across the sky.   I thought it might be a satellite, but I was unsure if satellites travel from south to north across the sky.  It was not a shooting star.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

This thing was covering ground maybe at a rate of 400 miles every 1 seconds it was fast there was no super sonic boom or nothing.Boy the object I saw its really really fast faster than a f-22 raptor never seen something fly that fast and I seen a SR-71 and they are fast but never will be as fast as what I saw.There were a total of 2 wittneses.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Twin, non-blinking lights, one following the other, seen over Sacramento before turning red and fading out.;2009-11-25 18:00:00;5 Minutes;Twin, non-blinking lights, one following the other, seen over Sacramento before turning red and fading out. Saw twin lights, one perfectly following the other (about a thumb's length on an outstretched arm), from the west (just north of due west), beginning about 35 degrees in elevation.  They proceeded eastward, curving slightly toward the south.  The moon (half moon in waxing gibbous phase) was about 5 degrees from its zenith.  The curvature of the objects' course brought them to appear to pass south of the moon.  As they neared the moon's position, first the lead light and then the following light turned red and faded quickly.  It was after I had first noticed that the objects were in motion and without blinking or nav/running lights that I sumoned my wife to see for herself.  My background: I was a Boatswain's Mate in the navy, worked as an archaeologist and environmental planner after college.  Presently a planner for the state.

Three bright lights low in the night sky almost equidistant from each other over Sacramento, California.;2010-05-06 21:20:00;about 6 min;Three bright lights low in the night sky almost equidistant from each other over Sacramento, California. I was driving to my home in Sacramento from my work in Roseville, California on southbound Interstate 80. As I approached downtown Sacramento I noticed four very bright stars in the sky over the city. Within seconds I realized that one was a distant airplane (because of the red and green lights that I noticed it exhibited as I looked more closely). The stars were about seven full moons apart from each other. As I got closer to the city I could see that the lights were seemingly stationary because their orientation altered naturally with my approach and the turns in the freeway. I apparently was getting closer to them. As I got into town, near the area of Sutter General Hospital the three lights were to my side. The closest of the lights was about five times bigger than a very bright star or five times a magnitude 1 star. It seemed to be around three hundred feet in the air. I tried to notice how far the closest object was from me but I couldn't tell. At first it looked closer than my exit which was coming up (the 16th Street Exit) but as I approached the exit I could see it was farther away... perhaps twice as far. Still, I knew these were not stars nor some other regular natural celestial phenomena. As I approached them they were in front of me when I got closer they were next to me and then as I went further they were behind me and they were low in the sky. I had seen them from the vantage of the freeway but as I took the exit which descended onto the surface streets the objects were lost amidst buildings and trees and I could not see them again. In all I saw the objects for about six minutes. Because I was driving on the freeway I could only view them intermittently but, perplexed by their strangeness, tried to make as good an observation as I could and remember as many details as possible.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
A light that, at first, appeared to be a star, suddenly flashed several colors and  flew away from the Earth until it disappeared.;2010-06-05 23:32:00;20 seconds;A light that, at first, appeared to be a star, suddenly flashed several colors and  flew away from the Earth until it disappeared. In the West Southwest sky, southwest of Spica in the Virgo constellation, between Virgo and Hydra, I saw a light in the sky that appeared to be a star.  Moments later, the star began changing colors from yellowish-white to red to blue and flashing excitedly, briefly got brighter, then it appeared to began moving away from the Earth at what I can only assume was a surprising fast rate of speed.  The light grew smaller and smaller until finally is disappeared.  There appeared to be a faint haze around where the lights had been.  The movement away from the Earth was very fast and took only moments. This entire event took only 20-25 seconds. I am a 50 years old man, a college-educated music teacher and music director, and married to my husband for nearly five years.  I have five children and 10 grandchildren.  I have lived in Sacramento since 1976.  I have never before experienced anything like this.  I am a man of faith, but not religious.

March 3, 2012 Seen in Western Sky or WNW sky over Sacramento, California on March 3d, 2012 at approximately 8:42 PM for about 10 minutes by two people (Husband age 63 and wife, slightly younger)  Appeared as a blue light in the sky that seemed more purple/blue to the husband, more blue to wife.  Have pics. Some red was see by husband and wife but only a little and a little white light seen by wife who has better eyesight.  No lights were flashing. Appeared to be moving fairly low in sky, not flashing and fading in and almost out.  There MAY have been another fainter, light color light in sky with blue light. hard to say.  Cam shows a light but it is possible it was a low in the sky planet or star (shown in one pic)   Viewed from Dealynn St. address just South of Hurley in general direction of Sacramento Metro Airport. No air traffic appeared from this direction although it is a common a busy route for large, commercial aircraft coming from Metro Airport.  Photos were taken with a Sanyo E1090 digital camera on a night setting using full telephoto (which is both optical and electronic with a 3X optical zoom. Camera set at 12 megapixels. The pic don't seem to capture the almost UV (filtered I guess, purple quality of the light which just seem only blue to wife) Husband wears glasses for nearsightedness. 14 photos taken, a few showed nothing, some showed bright blue wavy lines (as if camera was unsteady and took it's time to record image) Partial moon nearly directly over head approx. 10 min after observation.  There was one or more helicopters in sky shortly after seeing light, seemingly unrelated and most likely police helicopter () One was using bright lamp to illuminate ground. Helicopter lights were traffic light green, white, and red with flashing with noise. Copter was orbiting to south of residence and later one or same north, possibly going to another site or back to base.  Male observer sees a lot of air traffic from location, mostly large airliners coming toward residence from Metro Airport and somewhat to North. The other common air traffic sources are police and possible traffic helicopters which are very common in area. Small airplanes not common in this area. Facing East at this location (front of building, there is some air traffic from a different airport to the North. Often large Coast Guard aircraft and some corporate aircraft. (Large former airbase is to North)  The blue color of the light is what stood out mostly as well as fact that it seemed to linger.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Bluish pulsing light moving East to West over Sacramento, CA;2012-06-08 03:35:00;45 seconds;Bluish pulsing light moving East to West over Sacramento, CA I was outside with my girlfriend smoking cigarettes at the Red Lion Inn in front of our room in Sacramento and looking up at the night sky. We observed and noted the Big Dipper constellation. I then noticed a bluish light a bit larger in size than the stars making up the Big Dipper. I asked my girlfriend if she saw it and confirmed she did as well. We both observed this light move from East to West over Sacramento. It blinked on and off about every 5 seconds.  There were no visible clouds at all. This ruled out the blinking of the object to be from passing behind clouds. We heard no sounds at all overhead. The object moved from just under the handle of the Big Dipper to above the star Arcturus in about 20 seconds. We were able to figure out that it was Arcturus using the Google Sky Map app on my girlfriends phone. It then continued across the sky another 10 seconds and then changed direction in a right angle turn that appeared to head downwards as if coming to an abrupt stop and then descending. The object appeared to descend for about 5 seconds and then disappeared entirely.  The time durations are based on the blinking interval that seemed to again be every 5 seconds. The object was nearly invisible to the naked eye and would only be seen every 5 seconds when it emitted a bright blink or flash that was bluish in color. It was like tracking a firefly flying across your backyard. I noted the time of the event after first seeing the object by checking my watch.  It was a full 11 minutes before the ISS was supposed to transit the sky at 3:46am for that Lat and Long as confirmed by spaceweather.com. I do not believe it was the space station. There were no meteor showers anticipated for the evening either.  I have seen &quotshooting stars&quot and this did not match what I have seen during meteor showers. There were no other colored lights such as red to indicate this was a commercial or military aircraft. I may be tempted to believe this was a satellite except for the sharp stop and direction changed we observed in addition to the bright flash it made every 5 seconds as it transited the sky.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Then it turned blue once more and went all the way down until it was no longer visible and did not come back up again. The whole thing lasted about 4 minutes.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

There was some cloud cover and could not see any stars. I noticed the lights directly in front of my car there were 2 at about 20-25 degrees above the horizon and a third a little farther away at between 15 degrees above horizon. The lights seemed odd to me as there were no  FAA lights. They alternated red and orange. The lights seemed to be moving southbound in my direction.  Two of them went directly over my car, the other was to my right (east) of my car.  The one to the right was the brightest of the three. I did not know if there was any noise as I was in my car with the windows up.  There was also some cloud cover, and the lights were below the clouds.

On Jan. 25, 2013 approximately 7 pm, my brother and I pulled up in front of my parents house near the intersection of Gerber and Power Inn in Sacramento, CA.  He pointed out some lights in the sky to the southeast.  I observed 7-8 red/orange bright balls of light floating upward at a slightly slower pace than an average airplane travels.  The balls of light were almost twice the size of a star and flickered a little bit like floating balls of fire.   At first the balls of light formed a serpentine pattern and were low in the sky, as they floated upward they came together to form a slightly curved line with a good amount of space between each one.  My brother went inside the house and then came back out with our mom and my boyfriend.  The four of us watched the balls of light disappear into the clouds, the whole indecent lasted about ten minutes.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Bright violet light covered in mist, when it stopped moving, the mist formed a perfect sphere around the light. ((anonymous report));2014-06-01 04:00:00;30-40 seconds;Bright Violet light covered in mist, when it stopped moving, the mist formed a perfect sphere around the light. I am going to be completely honest.  I was out at night collecting wood pallets, that's the reason I was up so early in the morning.  We ended up in front of a friends house to store the pallets away for the night.  As we were sitting around talking, I noticed a light through the trees.  So I stepped aside to get a better view. When I did get a clear view, I immediately knew exactly what I was looking at.  What I saw was a bright violet light with mist trailing behind it.  It was about the size of a semi truck and it was moving slowly.  So I had called my friend to come and look at it, and around the same time he had eyes on, it had stopped. When the UFO came to a halt, the mist that was trailing it suddenly surrounded the light like a sphere as if it were (For lack of a better term) a force field.  The light maybe 10 seconds after stopping shot away into the night sky like a meteor. I am very knowledgeable in aircraft, this wasn't man made in anyway.  I have actually seen other types of UFOs as well.  This one I am absolutely sure to be extraterrestrial, at the least!  One day I will catch one on camera.  Hopefully my drawings will help others somewhat visualize what I saw, or maybe prove me wrong. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Was on the phone outside when I saw two lights off in the distance in the sky, not blinking like a plane's lights do.  They were flying next to each other so immediately I thought they were military aircraft in a training exercise.  They seemed to be coming toward me, but after second thought I think they were going up.  They started moving away from each other, and then one disappeared, followed by the other disappearing about twenty seconds later. Then, from the horizon, a similar light went up and disappeared, this time by itself. Next, two more lights came from the horizon, just like in the first description, and disappeared after parting ways. The sky was a bit cloudy but not enough to block out stars, etc.  I'm sure it wasn't a commercial aircraft because I saw commercial aircraft flying when I saw the lights.  Very interesting sighting never seen anything like it before.  I was thinking maybe it was a missile but I've seen those too and they were moving too slowly to be missiles.  Still scratching my head.

NOTE: SEEMED AS THOUGH THE CONSTILATION URSA MAJOR A.K.A BIG DIPPER MAINTAINED A STEADY POSISTION LOOKING NORTH.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
There was an orange light flying in the sky that was changing direction very rapidly.;2017-12-20 20:05:00;3 minutes;There was an orange light flying in the sky that was changing direction very rapidly. A friend of mine sent me a short video on Snapchat of an orange light that was flying around in the southern sky.  Looked at the video and walked outside to see if he was just trying to play a practical joke.  When I looked to the south I saw exactly the same thing he sent me, a bright orange light quickly changing directions and leaving streaks in the sky. The streaks last about four or five seconds.  One of my cats was outside at the time and was frantically trying to get inside as well as hissing at the object in the sky.  The object was flying and changing direction too quickly to be a plane, a helicopter, or a drone.  There was looked like a commercial airliner in the sky at the same time.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Bright, square white light, flared, then dissolved.  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch???  PD));2018-10-07 19:22:00;3 minutes;Bright, square white light, flared, then dissolved. On this Sunday evening, I returned home about 8:20 p.m.  Above my house, looking south-to-southeast, I saw a bright white light, that appeared to be flaring upward.  This light sat stationary just above the roof of my house and appeared to change shape, as it slowly descended until the main portion of the light dissolved and flared out.  This bright light measured approximately one-half inch between thumb and index finger with arms extended.  The light sat between two planetary objects, which were also captured in my iPhone still image and video (attached in an email). The principal light source did not appear to be a craft of any sort.  But the high luminosity suggests it was something very unusual, especially as it flared and then dissolved in night sky, below my roof line.  Several minutes later, I walked around the corner, but could not spot it anywhere in the southern sky. (Thanks for all your work in this area over the years, Peter!);38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

As soon as we both looked at it the light darted/shot away.  We both said what was that?.  Seemed to disappear as soon as we both noticed it.  Made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

Star not a star.;2019-10-17 00:00:00;2 minutes;Star not a star. Watching tv when I heard a noise in the backyard. When I went to check it out I didn’t see anything. It was a cold night and the sky was lit with stars had no choice to admire the bright clear sky. Standing there for a couple of seconds I noticed what appeared to be a star, but it was moving slow and then it stopped. 10 seconds later a flashing red light was moving all around the object, going up,down,left,and right at a incredible speed. I got kinda spooked and couldn’t really figure out what I was looking at. Went inside to tell my gf who was sleeping, by the time she went to take a look it was gone.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Line of ligt objects traveling evenly spaced across the sky.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-26 19:20:00;10 minutes;Line of ligt objects traveling evenly spaced across the sky A series of at least 18 light objects (I counted 18 but there may have been more before I noticed them) following each other in a straight line from southwest to northeast. They appeared at the same point, traveled directly overhead and then disappeared at the same point. I tracked the speed as 10 seconds from Orion’s belt to the next brightest star to the north east, each taking about 30 to 45 seconds to appear, travel across the sky and disappear.  Twice there was another light object traveling at the same speed along the same trajectory but north of the long line of lights.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
8 lights hovering over Sacramento skies;2020-04-16 21:10:00;21:20;8 lights hovering over Sacramento skies Seen 8 lights hovering around the Sacramento skies.  Flying around erratically, but spaced apart.  Very cool sight to have witness.  The objects didn’t have distinct colors other than if being white, similar in color as stars in the skies.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
