6 hyphen-shaped yellowish-white objects flying as group but shifting positions from NE to SW (Reno-SF) at approx. 35K alt. and 450mph.;1976-02-15 20:30:00;1-2 min.;6 hyphen-shaped yellowish-white objects flying as group but shifting positions from NE to SW (Reno-SF) at approx. 35K alt. and 450mph. From the top of a building in downtown Sacramento I noticed 6 objects in the NE sky towards Reno. All 6 were identical, shaped like simple dashes or hyphens, and were oriented horizontally, (i.e. like the wings of an airplane, not the fuselage). They were the same bright, yellowish-white color as an ordinary light bulb filament. As they silently flew on a straight, SW path across the sky, they stayed in a tight group, while smoothly and continuously shifting positions in relation to each other. Their speed and altitude appeared to be very similar to that of an average commercial jet at cruising altitude. It took approximately 1-2 minutes from when I first saw them coming from the direction of Reno until they faded from sight in the direction of San Francisco.

grey alien was seen in Sacramento in july, 14th.;1987-07-14 01:30:00;30-60 seconds;grey alien was seen in Sacramento in july, 14th. this is a report about an experience with a grey aliwn. sorry, it is not a UFO-report, but i think the greys have something to do with UFOs. so i hope it is useful also. if you want i can send a painting out of my mind about what i have seen , then please contact me.  the report:  1987, in July, I visited my family in California, Sacramento. There I had a very exceptional situation.  Actually with something who is known under the grey aliens in cases in literature. Before this specially night I did not knewn anything about this theme!   The experience have been at July, 14 th at 1:30 a.m. in my guestroom.  Short time after I went to bed the situation has happend. I wasn´t sleep for sure, the lamp in the room was switched off and it felt a little bit moonlight into the room.  The situation continued between 30 to 60 seconds I guess. I laid on my back, was wake, my eyes were closed and I thought about the time I had been in CA. Suddenly, in that moment I noticed something is wrong in this room.  I had a feeling somebody or more than one person came into the room, but I locked the door before I went to bed.  So I tried opening my eyes and in that moment I heard a very quiet sound like from an engine or something like that. Exacty in that moment I noticed I was unable opening my eyes or moving my body arbitrarily.  So that unknown person or what ever have been now in my guestroom, was able to have an effect on my neural functions, I will say specially on the motor activities. I still tried opening my eyes with all power I got, and however then I was able to open them. I saw somebody standing next to my bed was looking on the middle of my body. Maybe the heigh of that what I saw was about 150 to 170 cm. The figure was analogical like human being. I will say it wasn´t looking usually human being like me and you, it was really very different. It was standing on two legs upright like a human. The head was a great one and I couldn´t see any hairs. I saw into a face resembling a human, but also very different from all what we know. It wasn´t a usual human, but for simpleness I will call it human from now on. So the human had two eyes, but much more greater than our eyes are being and they glow yellow. Where we have got a nose there I saw a longish elevation, who was located from brow area to chin. Downwards it became bigger. On it I saw horizontal subdevisions. The whole face was so much strangeness I only able explaining what I mean exactly in my paintings, specially the new one. The nose strictly was not a breathing mask or something like that. The head and the face seemed white-blue. I saw the body and head was encased by a transparently blue-white aura or something like that. I only can suppose what this human weared on body. It seemed like a metallic suit like an one-piece. I am not sure if I saw ears. So this human looked at my body with head down. I don´t know exactly how many seconds passed by, but I appreciate between 10 or 20. After that time I wasn´t able opening my eyes continuing although I wanted to and I was weak. So they closed and I was thinking to the housekeeper and also nurse (for the grandmother living next to my door). The housekeeper, Cora, laid in the hall on the floor on a mattress, directly before my guestroom-door. Actually the grandmother was ill and needed Coras´ help again and again in that night, so Cora decided sleeping in hall, because her own room had been on the contrary end of the house. I wanted to cry, but I could not use my voice. So I hoped maybe Cora will remark something, but she did not... In this moment I thought how strange this situation is and I felt so much terrified I can not explain. I really needed all my power to go through this situation at all. Otherwise I noticed the human wasn´t doing anything bad to me, only was looking on my body and I was still alive. I know this human was still in my guestroom and also I heard the quiet noise. So I tried opening my eyes again and I was able to do it again. In that moment I saw this human changed position about 90 degrees and was not looking anymore to my body, rather was looking to the guestroom-door. It seemed that he had knewn what I was thinking, in particular I thought to Cora, laid exactly before this door. After some seconds I had no power anymore for opening my eyes and had to close them again. After that suddenly I didn´t hear the noise anymore and also I was able to move myself and open my ! eyes again like nothing have been happend before. So as soon as possible I switched on the lamp, wrote on a paper what has been going on and opend the door. I waked up Cora for asking her if she noticed anything, but she did not she said. My condition was the same like before and I was still ok. So I stood up and went into the garden before the house for looking if there is anything. But I can´t see anything strange, went back in the house fast. I coudn´t sleep in that night anymore. At 3 o´clock a.m. my stepbrother Lucho came home from work and I told him what happened. He was listening to me and told me an experience about something he saw two years ago. Actually Lucho was standing before the house, was looking into the sky and saw an UFO. He went into the house to his mother and told that to her. So the both went out again for looking and there was no more to see. So the mother told him he should stopp telling things like that. This he told me in that night. Then we thought about the way this human was coming into the guestroom, but we/I still don´t know. I will repeat: before this night I never have knewn about greys or bedroom visitors or something like that. Till now I attest this is a true event. ((name deleted)) P.S. Sorry for my bad english..;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

As we stood there by the pool, the ufo turned at 90 degrees and directed its course along the west wing of the building. As the ufo made its 90 deg turn, it rose upwards by about 20 feet. It moved along the west wing, and then made another abrupt turn to the west, and it slowly vanished from our view. The ufo did not have any lights on it at all and we only saw it as an outlined shape moving against the evening sky.It was either rectangular or cigar shaped. It made absolutly no sound as it traveled. ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to have his friend submit a report, as well.

Similar to a jumbo jet huvering 15 feet above top of car. Silent with no jets or propeler on wings.  Metalic army green in color. About 5 years ago when I lived in Sac. My husband and I were driving down Florin Rd parallel Florin mall.  Are car was the first to stop at a red light.  As we waited for the light to change my husband told me to look out the drivers side window.  Both of us saw what appeared to be a World war 2 military cargo plane.  It was huvering  about 15 feet above the top of our car and slightly to the left.  The plane was a metallic army green color with no jets or propellers on the large wings.  As I started to panic, thinking that it was an air craft about to crash, my husband rolled down his window and told me to listen.  The craft made absolutly no sound.  I looked up at the cockpit window to see if there was a pilot, but the sun was reflecting of the window, and I couldn't see anyone.  The light turned green and we drove a block and a half to a Dennys restaurant, where my husband parked the car.  I got out and ran into the restaurant grabbing the first person in sight.  An elderly man exiting Dennys.  I asked if he could come with me out side.  I pointed the plane out to him, which had moved about a block away from where I first saw it, towards JC Pennys, at the Florin mall.  By this time it was about 30 feet higher than when I first saw it. It huverd there for a short time befor it slowly decended behind Pennys.  The man saw the plane making its decent.  I said to him What is that? as I pointed to the craft.  He stared at it for a few seconds, and replied I do not know! He turned and quickly ran to his car. When I first saw the plane it was huvering in one spot it then moved to the side gradually gaining altitude, huvering there for a few seconds, then slowly decended down like a helocopter would land.    I really need some sort of explanation on this matter.  If anyone has ever seen or hurd of anything remotly close to this incident, that day in Sacramento, or any where else please your info.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

((HOAX??))  Spaceship that changes itself to camouflage to fit color of clouds and dark shadow spot.  ((anonymous report));1999-02-15 18:00:00;5 minutes;Spaceship that changes itself to camouflage to fit color of clouds and dark shadow spot. I was playing cards with two my friend outside one of them house.  Outside the front porch where I happen to sit a little outside the porch, and they were sitting inside the porch.  So only I can see above the roof and sky but they can’t.  As we playing card I decided to look up the sky.  Suddenly a space ship flew fast and quietly down the sky and came to sit on top of the tree next to the roof.  First I thought it was strange and amazing at the same time. Amazing part was I the only one saw it and I didn’t want to scare my friend them and kept to myself.  So as I saw it coming down clearly it was amazing how fast it was and how it can change it space ship to camouflage that fit the shadow of the tree.  So if a person don’t pay attention you will never know it’s sitting up there.  I was thinking to myself that it might be watching me.  So I make it seem like i didn’t see it but my eye was on it the whole time.   Looking at the same spot it landed in the dark.  I cannot! see it after it landed but I waited and keeping my eyes rolling up on it.  When it’s ready to flew off it lights went around it space ship and it lift itself two three feet above the tree before it flew into the sky and disappeared within 5 sec.  This is true not a joke I wanted to share because I believed that I had really seen this ufo spaceship once in my life.

I saw a strange object from my patio at about 9:30 p.m. I could be off on the time, though not much. It seemed to be hanging in the sky some distance south of Sacramewnto, California and west of Highway 99. It was defined only by its lights, making it hard to tell its exact shape. It looked like a Y at first and then seemed to turn & become triangular, without changing its location. One light was pulsing, the others, in a row, were steady. The pulsing light was in front of the others and vanished as it turned. Even at that distance it looked very large. I watched it alone for about 20 minutes, going to the fence and looking between the posts to be sure it didn't move. Then I went to get a friend. We were back within 5 minutes and watched it for another 15 or 20. It was getting cold, so we went inside. I looked out again about an hour later, but a mist had closed in and I didn't see it. I left a message at the UFO forum & was given this site to try for a response. I'd appreciate knowing if anyone else in this area saw it when I did.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Boomerang shaped wing, flying silent and low over the I-5 outside of Sacramento.;2010-10-05 03:00:00;30 minutes;Boomerang shaped wing, flying silent and low over the I-5 outside of Sacramento. In August of 2010, I was staying in Los Angeles for about two months while teaching some Gracie Jiu-Jitsu seminars there. I headed back home (Southern Utah) in October, but decided to go through Northern California, see some friends in Sacramento, then head to Salt Lake City and stay with family for a few days before returning. I took the PCH to somewhere around San Luis Obispo or Paso Robles, then I believe I cut east to the I-5. It was very late (or early)... maybe 3 or 4am... I was about an hour and a half from Sacramento in some rural area with a lot of farm land from what I could tell. From maybe 1 mile away, I started seeing some lights that were really bright and aiming straight down. I slowed down to about 45 miles per hour and was watching them flying from east to west, VERY low (maybe 30' from the ground) over a field, then they would lift to maybe 80' as they flew over the Interstate, then dropped down again on the west side of it. As I got closer, I noticed that a semi was parked almost directly under the line of flight on the east shoulder of the I-5 North I drove up a little further and parked as well. There was almost no traffic at all, so I got out and watched. Being that close, it looked like a large, boomerang shaped wing with 4 or 5 lights (it's been a while and I don't recall exactly how many) aimed straight down. It was completely silent and I estimate it was around 40'-50' from tip to tip. Again, it would fly over the Interstate heading east (toward a little ranch house approximately .5 miles east of the shoulder I was parked on), 20'-30' above the field, then it would raise in elevation right before the ranch house, continue out maybe another mile, make a smooth turn south, and fly directly back to the west again. Always descending in elevation over the field, then raising up over the Interstate, then dropping again. I watched it for around 30 minutes and then decided to continue on. I have been searching for anyone else who may have seen something like that near Sacramento. I simply want to know if it was a civilian or military craft, or something else. If it was civilian or military, why would they be flying over someone's house with spotlights on, over and over and over? And what kind of craft makes absolutely no noise except for the sound of moving through the air? I know it seems strange to write now, but I have wanted some kind of answer since I saw it.

Blue spiral with white orb floating into it.;2010-11-11 19:00:00;2 minutes;Blue spiral with white orb floating into it. I was parked at a fast food location in the city of Antelope, California.  At around 7:00-7:15 p.m. I got out of my car and looked to the West of my location.  I was shocked to see a bluish spiral in the sky which appeared to look like a coil with one side being a very tight circle and slowly expanding to a very large circle. This spiral appeared to be rotating and was only a few hundred feet above the tree line.  I then noticed that a small white orb was floating into the large circle side of this spiral and as soon as the orb entered the spiral, the entire thing seemed to close in on itself like an accordion and then it all vanished.  I found this amazing due to the fact that this location was less than a mile north of an old military base called McClennan Air Force base.  I had no idea what I saw but in the time after I feel my entire life shifted. The entire thing only lasted two minutes and nobody around me seemed to notice.  I wanted to get a picture, but I was frozen and could not take my eyes off of this event.  It was oddly mesmerizing.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

It appeared at first to be an all-white airplane moving very, very fast. As it flew, we could see it turn over and around a few times, like a plastic bag would when blown about by the wind. It seemed to be in the shape of a scalene triangle with it’s tip bent back on itself.  We watched it until it appeared to fly down and disappear over the horizon.  I pulled out the camera on my cellphone but the object wouldn’t show up against the sky. The second object appeared about 5-10 seconds after the first one disappeared. Again, my friend pointed it out to me. This one was a sphere, the same color and size at the first one. It only reflected a small amount of light.  It followed the same trajectory and again disappeared over the horizon.  Event took place at Sacramento City College, and the objects were viewed while lying down in the grass in the courtyard.

Two college students spotted triangular and spherical UFOs on campus.;2014-10-02 16:40:00;20 seconds (per object);Two college students spotted triangular and spherical UFOs on campus. My friend and I, two community college students from Sacramento, had just gotten out of our classes and were hanging out together on campus.  We were sitting in a spot of grass near the library, which is a fairly open space with a clear view of the sky. Both having had a long day, we were reclined in the grass staring up at the sky when at about 4:40PM, we both noticed something white making its way across the vast stretch of blue. At first glance, it appeared to be a feather being pushed by the wind, but we soon realized it was at much too high of an altitude and was moving far too fast. Upon further inspection, we could see that it resembled a scalene triangle, and spun about and tilted at odd angles while it flew across the sky.  We brushed this off somewhat nonchalantly at first, laughing at the absurdity of the sight. After all, it had been a long day, and we assumed that it was, indeed, just a feather or some other spec of debris, and our eyes were playing tricks on us making the object in question look stranger. That is, until the next object came in. It had only been 10 seconds after the first, if even that, when another white object hovered across the sky in the same manner. This object was perfectly spherical and was not moving about in the same sporadic way as the first. That is, if it was, it wasn’t noticeable because of its shape. It was at the same altitude and was within our view for the same amount of time as the other, a mere 20 seconds or so of a quick and soundless hovering as it made its way across the plain of our vision.  	We reported the sighting via hotline right when the incident was over. My friend tried to capture photos and videos of the 2nd object in question, but it was so high up and thus appeared so small that it wasn’t picked up by their iPhone camera. Being that these two objects were so small and were silent, we’re unsure of whether or not there were any other witnesses.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

The head looked like a triangular and then it had a long tail that curved up at the end.  The long tail reminded me of a scorpion tail and there was no way it could carry passengers so i ruled out a new craft associated with the airport.  The tail was extremely thin and white.
