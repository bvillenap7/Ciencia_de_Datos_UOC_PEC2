Object in CA defied known laws of physics.;1991-04-27 21:00:00;20-30 min;Object in CA defied known laws of physics. Driving in somewhat desolate area on White Rock Rd near Aerojet.  Noticed stationary lights in sky at a distance.  Drove past and for some reason decided to turn around.  I turned my vehicle around and approached the area where the lights were located - again at a distance.  They were above an area that had a chain linked fence and was actually Aerojet property.   As I approached I noticed the outline of what appeared to be the outline of a bowl shaped figure.  As I brought my vehicle to a complete stop in the middle of the roadway, I noticed that the bowl shaped figure had begun to turn.   I focused upon the figure itself as it turned.  While my eyes were fixated on the figure at a distance, I suddenly and instantaneously sensed a very close presence.  Within the blink of an eye - the object that began it's turn at a distance completed it's turn two feet from the driver's side of my vehicle.   The object appeared to defy known physics and made absolutely no sound.   As it completed it's turn, several very bright lights came on.  I did not feel heat but the lights themselves were somewhat blinding.  Due to the closeness of the object to my vehicle and the lights - I could not see the object in it's entirety.   The portion of the object that I could see at that point, however, was not particularly bowl shaped but, rather, appeared somewhat rectangular and similiar to the front grill of a car (but much larger).  There were approximately a total of six lights- three on each side - that, again, were large and very bright.  When they went on - it was similiar to a lights, camera, action scenario where you see movie lights on a camera set turned on.   The object remained in the air and at it's lowest seemed suspended approximately one foot off the ground on the driver's side and at an angle.  The rear - that I could not see clearly - appeared  to be, perhaps, higher.  There was a window of sorts - somewhat similiar to the front window on a vehicle but smaller.   I detected movement from within but could not see anything clearly (and did not want to).  Initially I froze and then absolutely floored my vehicle in an attempt to get away.  As I swerved down the darkened two lane road, the object that was facing the driver's side of my vehicle turned with the lights remaining on and faced the back of my vehicle.   I watched it in my rearview mirror - fearing that it would follow.  It did not but, rather, turned once again, in the opposite direction.  I drove to Hwy 50 (nearby) and took some comfort in the fact that I was surrounded by other (known) vehicles.  To my left, however, as I drove a stretch of 50 heading home - I looked to my left and could see the lights of a very, very low flying object - flying parallel to me and at a distance.

slow moving starlike object that appeared to chaged shape in broad daylight;2005-07-18 17:30:00;over an hour;slow moving starlike object that appeared to chaged shape in broad daylight I was in my backyard around 6:30pm watering my lawn and I look up to the north and there is a bright white object in the sky that got my attention it was moving but not going in any direction kind of rotating itself and it was hard to see because the sun was still out and this thing would either reflect the sun or it would light up every other second because this thing looked like a star in broad daylight it also appeared to change shape and when I looked at it.  The object appeared to give off some kind of heat like if you look down a road in the summertime the way the heat from the sun reflects off the pavement this thing appeared to have a circle around it and outside this circle it was giving off waves heat like reflecting the sun so I called my roommate (A Network manager at an architectural firm) and he told me to get the video camera which I did.  It was my first time using my roommate’s camera and after viewing what I had there are parts where this thing has 8 or more orbs in a triangle formation.  this object then headed slowly to the south east at which point I saw a commercial airliner fly right past it the pilot had to have seen this object, around 7:30pm my roommate gets home and I point the thing out to him as it was now much farther away he agreed with me it definitely wasn’t a plane and neither of us had any idea what this thing was. I am a California State Employee of 12 years.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
starlike object  changing shape for over an hour over Sacramento;2005-07-18 18:30:00;19:30;starlike object  changing shape for over an hour over Sacramento I was in my back yard watering the lawn around 6:30pm I work for the State of California Legislature and I look up and see this light that would brighten and then get dim to the north  of downtown Sacramento I dont know if it was the sun reflecting off it or what it almost looked like a star the way it was lit up but but it was much to low and it was moving as I was watching it if you looked carefully there looked like there was heat coming from it like how the sun reflects of concrete of in the distance in the sumertime. so I tried to call 3 different people and finally get a hold of my roomate who tells me to get the video camera which I did and filmed as much of it as I could about 17 minutes worth when I zoomed in it looked like one of the ufos I had seen from a guy name Anthony Woods the cluster of orbs that would change shape although it was hard to keep the camera still it was the first time I had ever used it plus the time of day it was hard to see what exactly this thing was this thing was hovering over Sacramento for over an hour I saw 2 different planes 1 was a commercial airliner that had to have seen this thing the flew right passed it. when my roomate who is a network manager at a architectural firm got home it was an hour later around 7:30pm and the thing was to the south east. It was still visible but much farther away he saw that there were no other stars out and this think was getting brighter and dimmer when he saw the video he definitely agreed it was a UFO. It was no plane. Did anyone else in Sacramento see this?;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
flying object in sacramento;2007-05-28 11:50:00;4min;flying object in sacramento I saw a rectangular, relatively flat object less than three sq meters Hovering above me.  Initially I saw it about 1500 feet. It was constantly alternating between flat to a three dimenisional x shape. (the shape changing appeared to give it lift).  As it flew away from me it gained in altitude, never going over 2500 ft.  As it got further away, it was impossible to see when it was in the 3-d x configuration.  The object was grey/black. There was no sound to the object. I have worked in the aviation field for years, definitely not a kite, weather balloon, or any other mis. item.  This gave me an ingenious idea to create lift, I will try to reproduce.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

We were on my deck and we saw a large lit up ufo that changed shapes.  It flew right above us and hovered close to a near by nieghbors tree and floated off slowly. It was clear but darkish on the bottom of it.   My other friend was called up by me and i told him what I had seen. He went out side and saw it also and gave me a clear description of what I had seen also.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

clear night sky, bright object, changing shapes and moving quickly in every direction with no pattern.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2009-05-09 04:30:00;over 1 hr;clear night sky, bright object, changing shapes and moving quickly in every direction with no pattern. From at least 4:30 AM thru 5:55 AM from the mid 5200 Block of the 60's Streets in Sacramento, near Fruitridge and 65th  - due East at what I believe was about 20 degrees above horizon was a bright light that stayed visible but moved quickly up and down, side to side and at diagonals. It stayed visible varying only slightly in any direction until approx 5:20 AM at which  time it quickly moved up and right and stayed there for at least ½ hour.  There were 2 witnesses.  We got some video footage but it's not great.  Used a telescope to try to get closer but all we could see was a bright light which seemed to morph in shape and move quickly in any given direction without notice.  Could not make out the shape of object except that it seemed to change shapes rather regularly.  If others saw this or know what it could have been, insight would be appreciated.  It was impossible to tell the distance but it was many miles away.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Dark, noiseless, floating V shaped object, moving from south to north, morphing shape;2012-03-09 20:00:00;5 minutes;Dark, noiseless, floating V shaped object, moving from south to north, morphing shape Sitting in backyard, stargazing, the sky is clear overhead and to the south, cloud bank to the north.  Moon not yet risen. I am looking in the direction of Orion (to the south) and happen to notice a dark, V shaped object, appearing very much like formation of geese.  It was nearly the same color as the sky, un-iluminated except by light pollution of Sacramento.  It moved at a constant speed from south-north and passed directly overhead.  It appeared to be ~1000-2000 ft in altitude, though that is pure speculation--it was about 3-4in in length from where I was sitting. As it approached I noticed that it was a continuous shape with no discreet elements.  The point of the V was forward and the tails were moving in somewhat of a ribbon-fashion.  At one point the tails angled sharply inward to form an almost complete outline of a triangle.  As it passed into the north the whole length began curling around and overlapping, somewhat like a treble clef.  It was noiseless and was not accelerating.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Car dealership confused on what they all saw floating in the sky for 2 hours.;2012-12-11 15:00:00;2 hours+;Car dealership confused on what they all saw floating in the sky for 2 hours. While I was working this afternoon, I noticed a black spot in the sky just beneath the clouds.  At first I didn't pay much attention to it, thinking it may have been a balloon, or a helicopter hovering over the downtown area.   About 15 minutes go by and I realized this object suspended in the sky wasn't moving, or flashing lights, and was to high up for the police and news helicopters I see on a daily basis.   I went to my car and grabbed my cheap pair of binoculars to get a better view.  It looked like a long bus, black in color.  I observed the object for about another half an hour when 15 if not more of my co-workers begin to take notice what was in the sky.   My co-worker went to his car and pulled out his binoculars and the view was better than the my pair.  I couldn't make out any lights, although one co-worker said she saw a blue light on the right side of the object, no one else stated that.   When I was watching the object through my co-workers binocul! ars, I noticed the object looked more saucer shaped, but then it would change to a long bus shape, it was hard to tell what was going on because the object was really high up.   Several people said it was a weather balloon, but this object looked nothing like a weather balloon, and at the altitude it was hovering at, the balloon would have been blown around in the jet stream.   I watched the object until I could no longer see it because the sun went down, and as the sun disappeared, the object remained.  I know it wasn't a bird, or a plane, or a helicopter, or a balloon, what I saw was something I've never seen before, and unexplained in my opinion.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Bright white pulsating light, changing in shape and color (white, red, and blue).;2013-09-05 20:30:00;~10 minutes;Bright white pulsating light, changing in shape and color (white, red, and blue) It was dark out side with a hint of light still on the horizon.  I was out on my back porch when I stood up to look at the sky and saw a very bright light, low in the sky towards the horizon.  I quickly looked around at the other dim stars and realized this was too big and too bright to be a star.  I was staring at the light for a couple minutes and noticed it changing in shape from what looked a traditional star (shape), circle, and to a triangle. It was not moving but was pulsating, and would pulse hints of red and blue.  I knew it was not a plane as one was passing over me, closer then the light but was still smaller and dimmer then the light. I got the light on video for about 2 ½ minutes. I am not so sure how to work the zoom on my phone so it does not do it much justice, but you can clearly see it and even a plane passing by, which looks completely different.  The stars where not visible on my video because they were so faint. I am sure it was not a star or plane.  I had to go inside to but my baby to sleep as he started fussing.  I did not want to leave the light, as I felt it was going to do something. It was just something I have never witnessed before. It was almost mesmerizing.  I came back outside immediately after I put my son back to sleep and it was gone.  There were no stars even remotely close to the size and brightness of it.  It had been about 10-15 minutes between when I left it and came back. I can send the video if you are interested.  It is not very good video but you can see the light. Observer: 26 year old female, nursing student and mother of an 8 month old son. I am wondering if anybody else in Sacramento saw this?;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Glowing red light crosses night sky, stops, and then disappears into the moon.;2013-12-15 22:30:00;5 minutes;Glowing red light crosses night sky, stops, and then disappears into the moon. 12/15/2013 at 10:30pm I saw what looked like a fireball streaking across the sky. Then the object stopped in mid-air and appeared to turn, all the while glowing a bright red light.  Then it went black for a few seconds.  Then it started glowing red again and proceeded towards the moon, stopped again then went straight into the moon and disappeared at a high rate of speed.  Please note I tried to photograph this object, however, my camera did not register the object being there even though I was looking right at it with my eyes.  It didn't register on my friend's camera either.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Shape shifting sighting hovering over my daughters house.;2016-04-23 21:30:00;10 minutes;shape shifting sighting hovering over my daughters house. Driving four blocks to my daughters house i see the craft at helicopter heighth.  Lit up 3 in a row like the top of a stadium light.  Hovering then moves over four houses..hoveres, by then i had gotten closer almost to my daughters house who lives with her father.  The thred lights separated or moved over slightly shifting the dark shape changed.  It tilted to the right i could see the round dark shape of its bottom.  It was silent.  I dont know if it was a sound it made just then i guess i would say a short intensifying hum then it flew fast and i couldnt see where. It stayed low to the houses. It hovered over my daughters dads house. We asked him if he heard anything neither him nor my nine yr old son heard anything. It was some xfiles shit was my daughters opinion on what we saw. Best one i ever seen and so close i raced through stop signs to get near it.  Attaching only cell phone photo i could get while driving.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Glowing white cloud-like object sighted at night, dissipates into red haze and vanishes entirely.;2017-07-28 20:50:00;~10-15 (or 20 seconds?);Glowing white cloud-like object sighted at night, dissipates into red haze and vanishes entirely. We were flying down for landing when we noticed a strange object in the sky from the plane's window.  At first it was primarily circular, with a white glow in the center and a slight red tint/outline (similar to that of a flare, but it was far larger, stayed in the air for far longer, and did not flicker or flash.)  It seemed to last a while, and as time passed the object began to seemingly stretch and lose the white glow, obtaining a more oblong shape before dissipating and leaving a lingering red haze/glow.  It is also important to mention that it was off in the distance so the size of it could have been relatively large.  The number of witnesses is unknown but there could have been many, due to the fact that the event occurred in a city.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
