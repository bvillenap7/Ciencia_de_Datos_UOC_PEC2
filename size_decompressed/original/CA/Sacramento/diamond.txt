Diamond shaped object dropping flares.;2015-12-31 22:55:00;5 minutes;Diamond shaped object dropping flares It stayed in the air for most of the time.  Periodically it would drop what looked like flares.   It appeared as though it was very low, but once we got home I saw it elevate quickly and it's light dimmed.   Then it looked like it swung around and brightened up, then once more swung out and I lost it.  Kind of like in a squiggle line pattern, or sound wave pattern. Also, it had green and red/orange lights.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
