Through our bedroom window, my wife saw a flashing object low in the sky, NNE, at around 11:20 pm. I went outside and saw it, moving slowly.  It was flashing red and white, in a sporadic pattern. I got binoculars and saw that it had moved somewhat in the sky.  With binoculars, I saw that it was a flat object, with steady white light along the length of it.  It seemed close at that time, and then moved away as I watched it.  The flashing lights were very irregular, and seemed not to be a commercial aircraft. As I watched it, it moved from low in the sky, then lower behind some trees.  My wife, who had come outside by that time, and she noticed a similar object in the west, flashing in the same way.  That one as we watched it, also moved down so it was behind some trees. Then we looked back to where the original object had been.  Now it was higher in the sky, still flashing and moving generally downward.  It seemed much farther away now as the lights were much less distinct.  Finally, it disappeared or became obscured behind the trees that were in that direction. I don't know what this was.  My feeling is that it was not a normal aircraft, because of the overall movement-- low in the sky, then high, up, down, etc.  Also, the flashing didn't seem to be the usual wing lights of an airplane.  My hope is that this report may coincide with others who perhaps got a better look. If you have any questions, call us.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

I was letting my dog outside.So I stepped out for alittle sun,then I notice a humming sound.I first thought it was a prop plane flying low in the sky so I paid no mind to it at first.Then I noticed how long of a duration it took.It had had a vibration to it.It's a kind of feeling that you feel in deep your chest.I tried to locate it,and then I finally I found it. It was very high in the sky,it was sivlery white,hard to tell how big it was,but it took awhile to fly over.Long enough for me to get my binoculars from inside the house. There were no wings on it,so I know it was not a plane.So if there is anyone who knows anything about it or seen it let me know.It was cruising from the west going east toward placer county.I had a trifield meter too,and it pinged into the red.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
possibly disk shaped craft with changeing colored lights in a horizontal row.;2003-08-28 21:15:00;45-60 seconds;possibly disk shaped craft with changeing colored lights in a horizontal row. the craft traveled south to north about the speed of a normal jet liner at the same distance. but thin had a distinct row of lights that changed color and pattern (i.e. lighting up and going out from left to right and alternateing red green and blue) watched it untill i was sure it wasnt just a plane with wingtip type lights then went inside to get a camera..but couldnt get a picture because it dissapeared behind the trees and houses.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Metalic Cigar Object Disappears In Sky;2006-07-15 11:35:00;1 minute;Metalic Cigar Object Disappears In Sky Object Description: Long, cilindar/cigar shape, metalic, no wings, no tail fin.  Eventn Description: While driving S/B Rio Linda Blvd. in North Sacramento, I noticed a long Cigar shaped metalic object in the S/E sky. At first I thought it was a long airliner, but noticed it had no wings, nor upright tail fin. Trying my best to keep my eye on it, I pulled over and searched (with my hands) for my cell phone/camera.. Just after pulling over the object vanished. I got out of the vehicle and seached the sky and never located the object again. The total duration of the sighting was 1-2 min.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

I was looking at the cumulous clouds near the Sierra Nevada to the East of my window.  I saw what I thought was another jet airliner going South, and I squinted to see wings but I could see none.  I also thought it was strange that it headed for a cumulous cloud and went right into it instead of flying around it as all the other planes did.  I looked for a minute or so to see if it would emerge from the other side of the cloud, but it never emerged.  I have no explanation for what I saw.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Driving down the highway and saw a cigar shaped craft with a red light in the middle.;2007-02-26 11:00:00;20 seconds;Driving down the highway and saw a cigar shaped craft with a red light in the middle. I was driving down the highway on my way home from the mall, I had just picked up my sisters prom dress. As I was driving down the highway, I saw a red blinking light in the sky.  At first i didnt think too much of it, just another airplane.  But when I looked up again, I saw that the light was moving very very slow, too slow to be an airplane, and way to close to the ground.   As I got closer to it, I saw the outline of a craft, and saw that it was cigar shaped.  I pulled out my cell phone to try to get a picture of it, but i began to swerve and I didnt want to hit a car, so i put my phone away.  When i passed it, I looked back and it looked to just be hovering over the highway.   I was freaked out by the whole thing. I kept driving and eventually lost sight of it.

Cigar shaped object, white and silver/metalic in appearance, hovering over Sacramento at noon today;2007-08-18 12:15:00;1 minute;Cigar shaped object, white and silver/metalic in appearance, hovering over Sacramento at noon today I saw a strangely moving cigar/rectangular shaped object over Sacramento today at 12:15 PM today as I was traveling in my car south on Fair Oaks Boulevard near Madison Avenue. I was headed in the direction of Mather Air Field, so I assumed it was a large military plane. As I continued to look at it I noticed that it was not moving fast enough to be an airplane. It was so low in the sky that it should have been moving very fast. I could not make out any wings or tail, just a defined object, white in color, not glowing in any way, with a silver/metallic edge around the bottom and sides. It was shaped like a flattened (or squared) cigar, not completely tubular, and I could see the details of the shape in good detail. It was definitely a technological object—not cloudlike or organic in any way. It appeared to be hovering, possibly moving very slowly to the east. I was looking at the object through my front windshield for probably 30 seconds, as I was driving in slow traffic. I had to brake for traffic in front of me, and lost site of the object for a few moments, then found I saw it again through my driver side window.  I continued to look at the object hovering for another 20 seconds or so until traffic forced me to go forward, at which point I lost site of the object completely. It was as if it just disappeared—but I had to concentrate on the road so I can not say I saw it vanish—I just could not find it again. I thought it could have been a reflection in my window, but since I saw the same defined object from two different windows while craning my head around in the car, and since it was noon on a sunny day, it could not have been a reflection.  I can’t say how high it the sky it was, but I can say that I had the impression that it was the size of a school bus based on the detail that I could make out. No wings, no tail, no markings other than white on the top, silver/metallic on the bottom, with some contours and angular reflections on the bottom and sides.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
a sigar-shaped ,all shimmering object moving slowly over the street at noon;2007-10-20 12:05:00;15sec;a sigar-shaped ,all shimmering object moving slowly over the street at noon It was noon, I was driving in my car to work, I look up and saw a sigar-shaped object crossing over the street almost over me. I pulled over onto a parking lot to get a better view,took my cell phone to make a picture ,but the object disappeared right before my eyes.It looked like a sigar,all shimmering and had air waves around it,had no any lights. It looked like if you take an aluminium foil and rub it between your palms to make a sigar. The object is about 30 feet long. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Skunk smell for over 10 miles while very large craft  flew across the sky.;2007-12-13 21:30:00;20min;Skunk smell for over 10 miles while very large craft  flew across the sky. My son and I were driving home last week from Roseville into Sacramento. As we entered in the Sacramento area we witnessed a long cigar shaped craft with row of light on the bottom. This craft was very large and moving as fast as a low plane would appear to be flying. It was really dark and cloudy in the sky so we really could not see above the row of 10 or so lights but could see almost the out line of as it blended into the sky. Now something really struck me later and I do not know if this could be related or if this has happened before to anyone that has witnessed a something like this but the smell of skunk was very strong for 10 to 15 miles of our trip. (I am thinking that animals were freaking out from this this craft?)  I am reporting this because maybe someone got a better look at this craft then we did. I just wish I was not on the freeway and having to look at the road, so I am not sure what it was but have never seen so many lights and what appeared to be at leat 10 times the size of a lower flying jetliner.

Log cylinder flying thing extremely fast;2009-08-07 22:00:00;days;Log cylinder flying thing extremely fast Again we saw something in the sky traveling at a high rate of speed.  It was bright like the stars at first.  There were other aircraft in the air and you could keep track of them as for the light you could keep track only for a few seconds before it was gone.  But one of the witnesses pics up a flash light flashes it twice at the sky then a few minutes later the object reveals itself in a cigar shape thing with no wings or visible engines and flashes back 3 times in different colors first was bright then black in which we could tell the shape of it then bright like the color of the stars.  I my self and other witnesses have seen it sense the 4th of july around the same time and seen it up close later that night some of the witnesses are in the military and in there words that was very weird.  What ever the cigar thing was it was big and definitely not man made.  They seem to communicate because we have flash a flash light more than once and we get a response fr! om the cigar flying thing.  It might seem silly but we get a response.  The cool thing about this sighting is that the object camouflages it self with the night sky.  At times its really difficult to spot.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
At roughly 3:30 a.m. pacific standard time I witnessed three lights moving in a westward direction at longitude -121.342 latitude 38.70;2014-02-16 03:30:00;1 minute;At roughly 3:30 a.m. pacific standard time I witnessed three lights moving in a westward direction at longitude -121.342 latitude 38.705.  The object was cigar shaped with three dull but large yellow lights.  One light located in the center and one at both ends.  It appeared to be translucent but still connected between the lights.  It was flying below 30,000 feet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
