Stationary in sky for 15 minutes, then shot away into sky faster than sound, maybe as fast as light.;1999-06-06 19:00:00;15-20 minutes;Stationary in sky for 15 minutes, then shot away into sky faster than sound, maybe as fast as light. I simply saw an aircraft stay in one place for about fifteen minutes, then shoot off into the sky as fast as a beam of light lights a room.  (There was a fellow there witnessing it with me at the time).  It was far away, so the best description is that it did have what seemed to be saucer shaped lighting around the bottom of the craft. As one light to my left would come on, one on the right would go off.  They were white light.  I've no idea how something stationary could instantly propel away with such a great speed.  From where we were, there was no contrail.  I was too far away to hear or not hear any noise.  There is high probability this craft was near Beale Air Force Base. The best part of this story is what happened three days later. I saw another set of lights in the sky, moving slow over the city.  This was however very very different then what I had seen before, so I decided to try to get under it.  I entered the freeway and headed in the direction of the plane until I was able to get underneath it while exiting on 34th street.  I slowed and stuck my head out to look up.  It was a crop duster with white lights in rows along the entire surface area of the bottom of the wings.  I feel this was to cover up the sighting three days earlier. This happened in Sacramento, Ca, in summer of 1999. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Very bright Orange Pulsing Light Suddenly Vanishes in Skies Near Sacramento;2002-08-24 21:45:00;4 minutes;Very bright Orange Pulsing Light Suddenly Vanishes in Skies Near Sacramento My mother and I began talking about a very bright orange light in the southwestern part of the sky we realized it was too bright to be a star since it was at least 3 times brighter than Venus and orange and pulsing as though with some movement, though we couldn't actually track any progress through the atmostphere. So, we figured it was  a plane heading right towards us and I listened expectantly for the sound of the roar of a plane, but it didn't come. As we continued to discuss the orange bright pulsing light . . . suddenly, it just was gone. Just like that. Nothing. No clouds for it to behind, just absolutely vanished.  There were no flashing tail-lights or any identifying light patterns that signalled any aircraft we were familiar with, so this was rather a mystery.  If it was indeed a plane that made a suddenly turn, it's puzzling why no other lights were then visible. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) Orange Bright Object Suddenly Vanishes: part 2, seen in Sacramento, CA This is to update the earlier report. I spoke with my mother and she described the intensity of the light as brighter than any object in the sky (including the moon) and that it looked to her as though it were actually out in space, not in our atmosphere.  My earlier description was more of an estimate of size, since I was tired and not thinking terribly clearly.  Yes, it was brighter than the moon, though of course much smaller.  It was as bright as a firework, but again small, meaning you could imagine it being a planet, though in comparison with Jupiter/Venus etc. it's bigger, as it appeared on the ground.  She also was skeptical about the light being a plane landing light, since the light did not diminish before vanishing wouldn't a plane landing light fade somewhat as the projection of that light began to make its turn? And why no flashing tail lights? Was this a distant stellar phenomenon perhaps?  There must be some other reports of this somewhere.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
The UFO was an unusually bright white light moving slowly in a north to southward direction.;2003-07-13 09:00:00;1-2 minutes;The UFO was an unusually bright white light moving slowly in a north to southward direction. At approximately 9:00 am Sunday morning on July 13th, 2003 while leaving a local store I noticed a very bright white light in the sky. It was already warming up that morning as we had been experiencing over 100º days, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. The object caught my eye because of its intensity. I thought it odd that a light could be so bright during the daylight hours. As I pulled out to exit the store parking lot and get on the street I lost sight of the object momentarily as there was a building in the way. Once on the street and proceeding in a westward direction I again was able to see the object that appeared to be heading in a north to southard direction. The speed reminded me of a helicopter that is very common to the area whether they be a news helicopter of sheriff's traffic helicopter, i.e., it was moving slowly. I wouldn't guess the altitude, but it was lower then the commercial jets seen coming and going from the Sacramento Airport. Once seeing the object again when I entered the street I immediately pulled over to watch it. I watched it for under a minute and it just seemed to disappear. That is to say that light just blinked off and I couldn't see any craft  in it's place. I couldn't discern any type of shape as it just seemed to be a light in the sky. Being an investigator/researcher of anomalous aerial phenomenon since the 70's, I pay a good deal of attention to what flies  overhead. Although, I can't say what the object was, I can say with certainty it wasn't a plane or a helicopter. During the event the object/light never changed colors.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
We heard and felt an unearthly object pass down our street, traveling incredibly fast.;2003-11-15 23:30:00;2 seconds;We heard and felt an unearthly object pass down our street, traveling incredibly fast. We didn't actually see anything, rather, we heard and felt it. We live on an extremely short street, two houses from a stop sign. We were laying in bed, having just turned off the television moments earlier, when without any warning, something passed down our street, only 20-25 feet from where we were laying, traveling at an incredible speed, at least 100mph. This object did not produce any light, and it was gone as quickly as it came, and it definately wasn't earthbound. There was no engine sound of any kind, just the sound of the air moved by its force. Also, we could feel, so to speak, the disruption of our space as it passed.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

3-4 lights fly low over I-5 in central California;2006-06-15 21:00:00;5 seconds;3-4 lights fly low over I-5 in central California Driving North on I-5 towards Sacramento about 2-3 hours south. I am not familiar with the area. It was night and there were dark fields to the left and right of the highway. I saw a group of lights (3-4 round solid) about 100 yards ahead of me go over the highway from left to right and then down disappearing into the field to the right of me. I guess they were moving 20-30 miles an hour because I saw them for about 4 to 5 seconds.  My initial impression was that these lights were car lights that went over the highway on a bridge. That was how low the lights were to the highway. That I was going to pass underneath a bridge very soon. At least this was my driving navigation thought process and I kept waiting and waiting for a bridge. Then I realized there was no bridge to go under. I starting looking to the right, into the field, searching for an airport or landing field of some sort, lights of any kind but there was nothing but dark, unlit area.  I do not remember the exact time and date. I know it was in the late spring or early summer of 2006;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
A silent anomalous array of 3 white lights some 15-20 feet across flew south along US 5 at no more than 50 feet elevation;2007-07-28 02:30:00;30 seconds;A silent anomalous array of 3 white lights some 15-20 feet across flew south along US 5 at no more than 50 feet elevation The second sighting was full of apparent ambiguity. An hour after the first sighting I was on Highway 5 driving north at 70 miles per hour through the San Joaquin Valley. This enormous expanse of agribusiness territory has few settlements along the freeway. It is a desolate area with dry unpopulated low lying hills la short distance to the west To the east as far as the eye can see stretches desert transformed by irrigation into large industrialized farms.  Moving perpendicular to the highway I saw a faint red light crossing from right to left over the Interstate. It was perhaps half a mile away and from its speed and elevation, about fifty feet above the road, I immediately assumed that the red light was the tail light of a car on a freeway overpass. This impression was reinforced when after crossing the freeway the red light became a faint white one, as if I were now viewing a vehicle that had turned left from the overpass and was heading down towards me on an onramp in order to merge with the southbound traffic.  I immediately noticed that there was something wrong with this car.  Instead of the usual headlight configuration of two, there were three discrete white lights. They initially appeared quite faint in the distance. They were moving down towards me on what I assumed was an onramp. Traveling at about 100 feet per second I was rapidly closing with the lights that were arrayed equidistant from one another in a straight line parallel to the ground. The distance between them was fixed. I quickly realized that they were attached to something much larger than an ordinary car or truck. The light array covered a distance of at least 15 to 20 feet. My mind raced for possible explanations. Perhaps the three white lights were attached to some kind of large construction or agricultural vehicle that was lumbering down the onramp to get on the freeway. Or maybe it was on a side road adjacent to the Interstate. Why such an oversized vehicle would be cruising about at nearly 3 AM when driver fatigue and poor visibility would make such driving particularly dangerous was beyond me.  As I moved steadily closer, the light array suddenly became much brighter. They did not look like headlights at all, but rather like  landing lights of a small plane. As if to confirm this notion, the three lights titled sideways, lifted off the road and then headed up into the sky at a sharp angle. This was crazy! What would a small aircraft be doing flying so close to the ground along a busy Interstate in the middle of the night? It didn’t make any sense at all.  As the object that I assumed was attached to the array headed into the sky, I suddenly could no longer see the three white lights. Instead where they had been last seen was now just a solitary motionless red light. It seemed to be hovering some 50 feet off the ground and was just sort of stuck there in the sky a few dozen yards to the west of the highway. I was able to see this strange unblinking red light for only a few seconds as I speed by headed north.  The thought occurred to me that perhaps I had just seen a crop duster. On rare occasion during the day crop dusters can be seen flying along US 5. They are quite noisy and I believe they move a speed of no less than 80 miles per hour. The object that I had just seen was totally silent. In addition I estimate its speed to have been no more than 30 miles per hour. Its slow approach was one of the reasons why I had assumed it was on some kind of highway onramp. The unknown objects sharp upward turn with its nose pointing practically straight up  is not consistent with the flight characteristics of a small plane.  The entire sighting lasted no more twenty or thirty seconds. As I drove off I carefully noted that there was no overpass above the highway. There was no ramp on which the triad of lights might have possibly descended. Whatever I had seen crossing over the freeway at the beginning of the sighting must have been airborne.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

I waited for it to pass and when it didnt I ran outside to see it. However, due to trees I could not spot anything-but the roaring noise continued for another 5 minutes and then began to move across the sky quickly. Around 2AM I woke up and heard the roaring again off and on. It moves across the sky and is VERY low and loud. Also, shortly after I heard a string of police and emergency vehicles dispatched.

Three UFOS over 1-5 in Sacramento;2011-01-31 20:00:00;20 minutes;Three UFOS over 1-5 in Sacramento First and foremost I would like to appologize for my grammar as I do not have a word proessor program, so I will write my report as best as I can. As I was driving back home last night I saw a UFO at first I thought it was a helicopter but as I got closer to my exit I could see there were three others and they moved like no helicopter would for no apparent reason, they changed colors from anything to blue to red mostly staying in blue or red.  As I got to my exit they were to my right side about a mile far they would move in different directions and get to ground level and go back up over and over repeating this for varoius minutes. I could still see them when I got home as my house is right by the freeway.  They were above the freeway moving as a mentioned earlier up and down side to side.  I ran inside called my brother and he saw them too.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
3 bright white lights streak across sky in triangular formation, leave bright trail.;2011-09-02 01:14:00;1 second;3 bright white lights streak across sky in triangular formation, leave bright trail. I just got back from a run on the track of North Del Rio School Park in Sacramento CA.  At 1:14am Pacific time on 09-02-2011 I was on the north side of the track facing east (approximately 38.621686,-121.452999 according to Google).  I had just finished my run, and was looking up to stretch my neck. I was looking at the sky and what I saw amazed me.  From out of nowhere appeared three white lights clustered closely together in the orientation of a triangle pointing upward from my perspective. In the span of about a second, perhaps a little bit less, the three lights, maintaining their position relative to each other, streaked across the sky from south to north. The lights left a very bright streak of light across the sky.  Actually they left three distinct streaks, one from each light.  The streaks were very close together, and so they blended a bit, but I could still distinguish three separate streaks of light. It's difficult to gauge distance, especially since I am not sure how high up the object was in the sky. But it was close to the Big Dipper in my field of view, so I can say that it traveled about 2.5 to 3 times the width of the Big Dipper's cup.  It started about two cup widths to the south of the Big Dipper, and streaked north crossing the Big Dipper's cup then disappeared instantaneously.  The streaks remained in the sky just a fraction of a second longer, then also disappeared.  The three lights, and the streaks that trailed from them, where extremely bright brighter than any star in the sky.  I would have taken this for some sort of shooting star, except that I could distinctly make out three points of light giving me the impression of thrusters, like those on the back of the Space Shuttle.  I would like to make clear that I could not see the shape of the craft, and I do not think that the triangular formation of lights represents the shape of the craft itself.  Rather I suspect that the triangular light formation represented the craft's propulsion component only. The shape of the rest of the craft is unknown. There was no sound, and it lasted just a second at the most. I continued to walk around the track for about five more minutes, but I saw nothing further of note in the sky, so I headed home. Once again, it's very hard for me to gauge size or elevation of the object, but the three lights occupied a space that would have fit in the circumference of a dime, or nickel perhaps, from my perspective. And if I had to guess, I'd say it would have had to be up around 18,000ft a least. If I'm right about the altitude, and I may not be, then the size of the object would have to be rather large to occupy the circumference of a dime. While the probability seems remote, since the phenomenon was so brief, I'd be very curious to know if anyone else has had a similar sighting.

20-30 orange/red lights flying over freeway;2013-06-01 21:45:00;2-3 minutes;20-30 orange/red lights flying over freeway On Saturday evening June 1, 2013 at about 9:45pm my two sons and I witnessed a cluster of orange/red lights Flying over interstate 5 about 10 miles south of downtown Sacramento, Ca… What struck me as odd?  Was that there were 20 to 30 lights flying at low altitude, perhaps 1000 to 2000 feet above the ground.  The lights seemed to be attached to some kind of craft because they were all moving together in Unisom But we could not see a craft. We were driving northbound on I-5 as we approached the lights moving very slowly across the freeway.  They took up a large area across the freeway but as I mentioned we could not see a craft.  My one son thought they may be helicopters flying together but they were moving silently and at a very slow speed. When I caught up to lights and passed underneath them I immediately looked in my rearview mirror  to see where they were going. I saw nothing ,either whatever it was left without me seeing it or the craft or lights could only be seen from one side. Again I could not see a craft nor could my sons just the lights. I asked my 13 twin boys if they too were seeing the lights to make sure I wasn’t imagining things they confirmed seeing the same thing I was seeing. I work as a photojournalist for a local TV station. I called the station to see if anyone else had reported seeing the lights. The person working the assignment desk told  me they had gotten reports about  orange/red lights in the sky the night before, Friday May 31, 2013… In my career I have seen and flown in many Military aircraft and have also flown in helicopters covering news events. But this was really different there were no white or red blinking lights usually seen on airplanes and I would expect an aircraft flying that low would be very loud and we did not hear a sound.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Bright orange light to the east.;2014-01-01 00:00:00;1-2 minutes;I was on my front porch, which faces east, to film the neighbor hood at midnight, because of New Years.  I looked up after filming to watch the fireworks, and saw a bright orange light to the east. I thought it might be a star but was much brighter than Jupiter is right now.  There were several aircraft in the area.  My tree was somewhat in the way, so I moved to a better vantage point on my driveway check to see if it had FAA lights on it. It did not.  I watched it for about a minute.  It seemed to hover, then sped off to the east, the light slowly getting dimmer then disappeared completely. It was originally about 30 degrees above the horizon, and when it sped off seemed to go slightly higher. I am not sure if there were any other witnesses, but I was the only one out on my street at the time.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

While sitting in Bethel Henshel park in east Sacramento at approximately 11:20 pm, we observed an extremely large, super bright, white light appear above the neighborhood tree line in the northeast sky.  It rapidly descended in a straight vertical line until out of sight.  It looked like it was falling as there was no horizontal movement at all.  The whole thing lasted 2 seconds max.  It did not appear to be a falling star as it was too large, too low and falling too vertically.  Seconds later, a helicopter which had previously flown over the park, circled back and began flying over the area where the object had descended out of sight.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

I was gazing out the window when I saw a purple colored object about 6 feet from the ground traveling as fast as the car and in seconds it disappeared but when it disappeared it made a almost green color behind it and perfect circles followed behind it as it disappears there were that green color. It wasnt actually green that's the only way I can explain it. It almost looked animated, I have never seen anything like this before it's very hard to describe if it made a sound I would think it would sound like bloop bloop and gone.  There was no shape just colors it's so bizarre like an animation but real. We didnt say anything to each other for five minutes, it was the most bizarre object I have ever seen in my life the colors were not purple or green that's just the best way to describe this thing.  It's almost as if I was watching the flintstones and the great gazoo disappeared. Craziest thing I have ever seen in my life.

Triangle blinking lights.;2020-02-08 23:30:00;4 minutes;Triangle blinking lights. On Saturday night 2/08/2020 at 11:30 pm in the city of Sacramento, CA. while letting my dog out before going to bed, I spotted A flying object displaying three lights.  The white lights were in a triangle, blinking at about one second intervals with two lights leading and one trailing.  There were no red or green position lights on the craft and no sound.  It came in from the northeast of my position made A left turn of about 270 degrees and continued its flight north.  From my position in the southern part of Sacramento I could not make out any structural outline but I felt it was around 1500 to 2000 feet above the ground.  It made its turn about over the executive airport in Southern Sacramento. I am a aircraft mechanic and am very interested in all makes and models of flying machines and have never seen anything like the display I witnessed on that night and thought it should be reported.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
