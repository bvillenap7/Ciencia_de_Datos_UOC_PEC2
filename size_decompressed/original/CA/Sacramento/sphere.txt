Silver Ball in Sacramento Sky (carmichael) 07/06/01;2001-07-06 18:00:00;5-10 minutes;Silver Ball in Sacramento Sky (carmichael) 07/06/01 I stepped into my back yard and noticed something in the sky.   It seemed to be a round ball that was just hovering there and rotating.  as it would rotate I could see black and then it would turn and be completely silver and very shiny! It seem to hover in the same place just rotating for about 5 to ten minutes, then it almost seemed like it started either fading out or disappearing into the clouds.  It didn't look like anything I have ever seen.  I know it was not some type of balloon or known aircraft.  It looked perfectly round with nothing attached to it.  And it was shinier than anything I have ever seen.  When it would rotate to the black side it was not solid black.  That part is hard to explain. lol.  And just to add it seemed to be rotating slowly.  I also forgot to add that there did seem to be an aura or haze around the object!;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

bright light played peekaboo behind clouds over sacramento;2005-03-04 16:00:00;10 seconds;bright light played peekaboo behind clouds over sacramento was looking west from sacramento and saw a very high altitude bright light moving at terrific speed headed south west southwest. (Im former Airforce and know it was faster than anything I've ever seen at that altitude, including the re-entering spaceshuttle)  the objects reflectivity never changed like a plane does as the light plays off it. the light remained constantly bright throughout the rather long distance I saw it travel in that time. The light made an impossible turn to the south and dissapeared behind a cloud for about half a second, and then darted out at exactly the opposite direction, as if it had made a 180 degree turn on itself, instantly, it did this peekaboo thing twice before returning to its present south westard course and disapeared finally behind the clouds.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Orange and green UFO over Sacramento, Ca 11-22-05;2005-11-22 21:00:00;1 hour;Orange and green UFO over Sacramento, Ca 11-22-05 I stepped outside to smoke. While sitting on a patio chair I gazed at the stars. I noticed an orange star that was moving northward. It was too high to be a helicopter. I thought it may be a jet. But it was too high and bright. I saw a seemingly shooting star shoot up towards it but it burned once it was near it. It moved in a straight line then stood still for 3 minutes. Then it would move west and stand still again. The strange thing is a saw (for lack of a better word) sparks falling to earth fom this mobile star. They would look like a falling star very small and burn(perhaps at 30 feet in the air) before they would get close. As this unidentified objet continued I could see a shiny green color at it's center. My neck grew sore and I was scared with what ever was falling from the sky and evaporating. It was still there when I went inside my friends home.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
8/12/07 Strange spheres over sacramento 1:00pm.;2007-08-12 13:00:00;10 min;8/12/07 Strange spheres over sacramento 1:00pm. Today on my way home on watt ave going north at the intersection of watt and fair   oaks blvd I noticed 2 metal spheres gracefully dancing around in the air flying together simular to the way birds rise and sink on heat up drafts but in circular circle eight patterns kind of playing off of each other.they were fairly high up maybe a couple thousand feet. I stopped to deposit a check at the golden1 on on the corner..and watched more they were moving to the west seemingly slow but got out of site within 3 or 4 minutes so Im assuming fairly fast at that height. I noticed that without my polarized sunglasses on they were fairly hard to see.but with them on they were bright like a electrically charged kind of steel looking glowing hot metal sphere.got a strange feeling in my gut while looking at them,I think some other people near by were wondering what I was looking at.I was too mesmerized to care.Im a fairly avid outdoorsman and bird watcher nature lover...This was none of those things.Very beautiful and Different...Looked technological not organic.I very surprised to see something like this at this time of day..Like I said without my polarized glasses I probably wouldnt of seen it,Strangest thing Ive ever seen lived here my whole life.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Silver sphere in sky during news report about fire.;2007-10-15 13:00:00;10 minutes;There was a fire in downtown Sacramento, I was watching the channel 10 helocopter, and I focused WAAAAAAAAAY behind it, very high up, if I looked away it took me a few seconds to refocus on it.  It was a small silver sphere.  It stood still for about 8 or 9 minutes, then moved a bit, then just boom, took off towards the east.  The movements were not wind like, if that makes sense, more like a driven kind of object.  I saw you guys on the explorer channel, thought I would share this.  Weather balloon?  Who knows..  hahaha, I .....  hmmm, stood very still for at least 8-9 minutes, very still.  Was it a cloaking device?  Ha...:)  Love it!  Good luck, e-mail me back please if anyone has seen this object, I'm very interested... ((personal information deleted))   And no my e-mail is just a considence, I don't study ailiens or anything like this, but I am drawn to the stars, or they are drawn to us. Thanks...

FIVE UFO SIGHTINGS IN THE SAME PLACE FOR 4 NIGHTS STRAIGHT!;2009-08-14 04:00:00;2 hours;FIVE UFO SIGHTINGS IN THE SAME PLACE FOR 4 NIGHTS STRAIGHT! I have witnessed five bright multi colored objects in the sky over the last 4 days. On 8/15/09 at 04:00 hours. There was a bright object with blue, yellow, green and white beams of lights shooting from it and what looked like a halo around it and at times, I could see beams shooting from it. I grabbed my camera and took a  picture but it would not appear in the photo. I then taped a mini movie of the object and what I saw on camera was not what I saw with the naked eye. I witnessed what I feel is that same ufo on 8/16/09 at 04:00 hours, these objects stayed in the same place in the sky for over 2 hours on those two occasions. The next night 8/17/09 at 12:30 myself and a friend witnessed a similar bright multi colored  object in the sky but closer to us than the other 2 nights. This UFO appeared to be hovering over something and slightly swaying back and forth shooting very bright beams from it. At 01:30, we both saw two other objects in the sky that were fu! rther away. While the bright one gradually moved toward the other two they all appeared to be flashing beams of lights at each other simultaneously. This is all happening now while I am reporting this to you. It is now 03:00 hours and these objects are still in the night sky, but it looks like they are descending father away from us but they all are still visible and the multi colored beams of lights are still visible but are not as bright.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
No sound and invisible;2011-02-11 11:30:00;10 sec;No sound and invisible I was in my back yard when I heard a large coast guard plane, they go over our area frequently and I always look to the sky to locate them.  They are very large and fly low either coming to are leaving the local air base here.  I was looking to see where it was this was broad daylight around 11 a.m.. While looking for the plane I saw four silver balls one on top of the other.  I saw them for a few seconds only.   I observed them change direction and then vanished the shine of the balls seemed to make them invisible.  On a clock dial 11 am to 1 pm was all I could see them they just vanished in the light.  I couldn’t tell how far away  they were nor could I tell the size of the balls they moved fast and changed direction;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Soundless gray sphere near Sacramento International airport;2012-10-31 22:25:00;10 seconds;Soundless gray sphere near Sacramento International airport I live 7 miles southeast of Sacramento Intl airport and see and hear aircraft constantly. On Wed 10-31-12 at 10:25pm while standing just outside my garage door I noticed a soundless low flying sphere shaped object heading north approx 150 ft up and estimated 500 yds away to the NW of my position on Del Paso Road.  There were no lights on it or coming from within, but it appeared gray in color at night.  It was moving way faster than a bird could fly. It flew in a straight line north but seemed to bob up and down irregularly. Then suddenly, just before it left my line of sight right above the distant tree line, it vanished for a split second then I saw a brilliant white/yellow flash.  What baffled me most was the shape and size of this flash.  Its shape looked like a pie slice with hard edges and about 5 times the original size of the sphere. The duration of the event was no longer than 10 seconds.   There was a light rain falling and calm winds.  Gray.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
20 orange orbs hovering over Sacramento for at least 30 minutes.;2013-09-22 20:20:00;30 minutes;20 orange orbs hovering over Sacramento for at least 30 minutes. My daughter called me at 8:20 PM on her way to work.  Her words:  I  saw the strangest sight in the sky as I drove to work tonight. In the western sky looking from the Auburn Blvd/Watt Avenue area, there were about 20 orange dots.  I keep thinking about it, where they Chinese lanterns, flares, planes or some sort of Soltice celebration?  Or, were they UFOs? They hovered in the sky, one falling to earth and turning white in color. I know that flares can be caught in an updraft and hover.  I saw a helicopter head that way as I drove and by the time I got to work at 8:55, poof, nothing in the sky.  Stars don't change color, and are not that bright that low. Planes at least move.   She called me at 8:30 PM and I witnessed the following:  I was able to see approx 10 orbs from the Foothill Farms area of Sacramento looking to the west toward Sacramento: 1 orange/white one with white orbs on either side and lower, and one above another - all very low in the sky - approx 30 degrees.  Then a string of 7 more above them.  I watched them for approx 15 minutes I could only detect slight movement during those 15 minutes.  I called a friend in the Greenhaven area of Sacramento (south and west of Sacramento proper) but they didn't see anything. I called a friend in the Cal Expo area - she ran outside and spotted three  orange orbs hovering over Cal Expo, but when a plane approached the orbs, the orbs disappeared.  By 8:40, the lower string of orbs had moved closer to the ground and I lost sight of them by 8:49, although I could still see the higher string of 7 and the one orange/white one lower in the sky.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
About 12 noon I saw a bright orb from my front yard about 5 thousand feet above the south end of executive airport in Sacramento/;2014-10-29 12:00:00;20 minutes;About 12 noon I saw a bright orb from my front yard about 5 thousand feet above the south end of executive Air port in Sacramento, I had my wife bring my binoculars to me and when I got the orb focused in I saw a large brushed aluminum ord just sitting there in the sky,after watching it for about 10 minutes there was a Large bright red flash/explosion what appeared to be about 50-100 feet below it then a trail of smoke directly Below the orb, The orb appeared to have a protective field around it because the flash occurred below it,The orb just sat there stationary, an all white no marking large Lear jet flew underneath It & continued going east, I thought to myself someone just tried to shoot this orb down or the orb was starting some sort of propulsion system up hense the red flash & smoke, there was no sound the whole time I watched it even the red flash made no sound when it happened, the orb sat there for about another 10 minutes then moved steadily and silently off to the north east until it went out of site, My wife & son watched this event with me,they were amazed at what we saw..;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

While crawdad fishing on the American River, I looked into the sky and noticed an orange glowing orb.;2015-10-28 00:00:00;2 minutes;At midnight, my friend and I were on the American River, crawdad hunting in the river, when I looked into the sky and noticed an orange glowing orb.  I asked my friend if he thought it was a planet but it we both thought it to be too big for than.  We then thought possibly an aircraft but no blinking lights.  It just appeared to hover in the same location in the sky with no movement or change in size so it didn't appear to be moving the way an aircraft would.    As we stared at it we were deliberating about what it could be.  It was too big to be a planet but didn't appear to be aircraft.  We were perplexed.   After about 1 minute we looked down into the water as we moved toward the shoreline.   We looked away for about 30 seconds and then my friend said to me that the orb was gone.  I looked up into the clear sky and sure enough it wasn't there.   We spent 30 minutes discussing it and particularly its size (like a planet but bigger too big for that), color (orange glow like ! an ember) and how it disappeared or vanished (disappeared without trace).  It didn't seem logical.   The size and color of the object makes it hard to believe it just vanished.   It was in the high point of the sky and there's no way it sped off.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Object hovering and changing shapes.;2016-03-30 13:30:00;3 minutes;Object hovering and changing shapes. While sitting at a light facing westbound Arden Avenue, I looked up at the white clouds and noticed a small object that was hovering and then slowly moving towards the southeast.  As I watch this object move I got my video recorder on my cell phone out and recorded this object moving after a while it would stay hovering and looked like it was changing shapes and then it would travel westbound again and then it went a vertical a little bit because I was in traffic I couldn't sit for very long in the driveways that I was blocking as I was filming this.  After I got home and reviewing the video frame by frame I noticed that there were several objects one a triangle and another is sphere.  Several objects went whizzing by that I did not see with my own eyes but on video you could see them going by much closer than the object that was in the sky.  These were not Birds because I did Capture One bird and it looked completely different which was much larger.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
