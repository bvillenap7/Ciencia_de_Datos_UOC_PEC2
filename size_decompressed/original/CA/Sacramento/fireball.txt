We had just left SMF Sacramento Airport and were on I-5 headed west toward the Sacramento River bridge, when I glanced to my right and saw a greenish flash of light, like a shooting star,  going westward low in the air just westward of the airport.  No one else in the car saw it, so I never mentioned seeing a greenish fireball.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Giant fireball like that seen in recent singapor video appears than vanishes.;2001-11-24 20:04:00;10 seconds;Giant fireball like that seen in recent singapor video appears than vanishes. I walked out my front door and seen a bright large yellow (1)fireball (1/30th scale of the moon) traveling from north to east moving in a 60 degree angle, apox 90 degrees on the horizon. The tail was the length of a blimp seen at ground level and sparked yellow white. It appeared to have came from no where and than vanished, the last thing you could see was sparks from the tail. The remaining fireball seemed to disappear into a dark veil. A recent video of a UFO seem on the rense.com web site shows a UFO in the same precise alt. and traveling the same precise angle and direction, and demostrating the same physical behavior and resembled the physical description, my view of scale image was smaller than seen in the video and less duration. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder if the witness is describing the dramatic fireball that passed over northern California on November 25, 2001, at approximately 20:40 hrs..  However, that fireball was reported as green, not yellow.  However, the observer is a male, giving rise to the possibility of color blindness, although given his profession, he should know whether he has a color perception problem.  We will leave the date as recorded by this witness.  PD));38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
Bright turquoise light in Sacramento, CA;2007-02-18 22:00:00;Short;Bright turquoise light in Sacramento, CA On the way home from performing a gig, I saw a bright turquoise object drop very fast from the top of my windshield to below the tree line.  I was on the east side of the Sacramento river, facing west, having just come off Sutterville road and about turn on Riverside. It appeared to be just on the west side of the river, not quite straight ahead, and it was just a little to the right. My first guess was that it was a meteor, and I looked all over the local news next day for stories of a meteor hitting the ground somewhere in west Sacramento, but there was no story. According to a map of the area, the most probable area of impact was in a place with very few streets, which probably means very few houses. It may have struck and not been noticed, or it may not have hit the ground at all. That is what makes it interesting. It should have struck the ground after it went below the top of the trees. It wound seem unlikely for a meteor to evaporate just a couple of hundred feet before it reaches the ground. They usually do so while still high in the atmosphere. I have seen a few of them do just that. It crossed the entire arc of visibility (to me) in less than a second, and did not fade or slow down as it went, as it would have if it was going straight across the sky from behind me. If it was farther away than west Sac, or moving horizontally at high altitude, it had to be huge, and going at an unimaginable speed. It appeared round, and I estimate its size to be about half the diameter of a dime held at arms length. It appeared a little bit fuzzy, so I can't be more exact than that. These flashes in the sky are interesting, but I have never seen anything I can positively identify as an alien vehicle of any sort. I will watch this site to see if anyone else saw this object.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

Red glowing light climbs above Sacramento, CA on 1-08-12;2012-01-08 21:40:00;4 min;Red glowing light climbs above Sacramento, CA on 1-08-12 At 9:40 pm on 1-08-12 I was at home watching TV and my peripheral vision caught a red glowing ball approximately 30 degrees above the horizon in the north / northeastern sky through a window on the east side of my house. The object was visible for about 4 minuets as it climbed at a steady rate to approx 50deg above the horizon directly east of my home. At that point,  the ball began to grow fainter and appeared to change direction and go vertical or turn 90 deg away from my position until the light faded to nil 5 seconds later. Halfway through the observation I went outside to see if there way any sound, and heard nothing.  I can see and hear airplanes nightly through the same window and am familiar with the flight paths that are used in the skies above Sacramento. This was unlike anything I seen in the 10 years I’ve lived in the home.  I only possibility I’ve been able to come up with is that 40 NE of Sacramento is Beale AFB, home to the 9th Recon Wing of t! he Air Force.

Orange ball of flame crosses North Sacramento - no news reports.;2012-11-11 17:56:00;3+ minutes;Orange ball of flame crosses North Sacramento - no news reports 11/11/2012 approx. 1757 hrs. Driving north on Morse Ave. from El Camino in North Sacramento, observed large bright yellow orange light traveling from NNW.  I stopped my vehicle to get better view through tree branches. The object moved at a deliberate pace along a flight path nearly due south.  As it passed overhead, it appeared to be a slowly roiling ball of orange flame, however showed no disturbance from surrounding air, no streaking, no trail, and no discernible noise. I tried to observe signs of craft disintegration due to inflight emergency, but no debris or disturbance of flight path was visible.  Duration of the observation was no more than 3 minutes from the appearance at 40 degrees above the N horizon to 30 degrees above S horizon when the object flashed off and on 2-3 times before disappearing from view.  As remarkable as this sight was, the relatively undramatic speed and straight path made the appearance seem relatively mundane. I was raised in the approach path of a civil airport and have lived for 18 yrs. within ½ mile of the local airbase , and am quite familiar with the appearance of all manner of civilian, commercial and military craft in nearly all conditions this one, despite the lackadaisical pace, was unique in my experience.;38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897

The orange light seemed to pulse from the objects but not any engine sound at all.   The second fireball was by itself and proceeded in the same direction heading NE towards McClellan airbase.

It was in a very controlled floating direction moving downward, like aircraft landing position, but at the same time leaving a laser like red trail that could be seen as the sun was going down across the horizon.

Fireball with trail similar to a comet seen navigating over roof tops of suburb of city.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD));2016-07-27 21:35:00;2 minutes;Fireball with trail similar to a comet seen navigating over roof tops of suburb of city While walking my dog I saw what looked liked an orange ball shaped light with a trail following of what looked like sparks.  The ball shaped object looked to be similar to a burning sparkler like the type kids light on the 4th of July.  The object was flying approximately 50-100 feet above ground and navigating between larger objects in the area.  At first glance it looked like a meteorite with the trail of sparks but it was too low and seemed to navigate around large standing trees, power lines, and two story homes.  I've seen other strange things around this area, but nothing quite like this.  I went to take a closer look to see if maybe it were a crashing plane or meteorite but there was nothing where it should have landed.  I first observed it through trees and assumed the trail of what I'm going to call sparks were just glare, but when it came into the clearing I saw that it was not.  There also seemed to be a dark residue in the sky in the objects flight path, but not smoke. No sound was heard from the object, just a visual observation.  I'm curious if anyone else has seen this object.  I've seen other lights that would hover and make figure 8 patterns in the air, which I tracked for miles while driving home where it settled over an old building and put on a show for 20-30 minutes before disappearing into thin air. This light looked like a police siren that would flash green for a while, then red, then blue, then purple and repeat in no discernible order.  I took a video of this but it somehow got deleted off my phone. When I had looked at this video I saw other strange lights that I didn't see when filming with my phone. This was approximately one year ago. I've seen other very similar lights but just dismiss them now because they are so common. I'm not sure what to make of what I've seen but it keeps getting stranger and stranger as time goes on. ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD));38.5717248419148;-121.44709701897
