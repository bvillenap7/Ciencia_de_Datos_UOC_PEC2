Weather was very clear, I was taking my two children swiming and noticed a classic looking round shinny disk moving across the sky. I then asked my kids to tell me what they could see in the sky and my 9 yr old daughter replied looks like a fling dish dad, my 6 yr old then said yes dad looks like a shinny plate. the object was traveling from north west to the south east over the Ontario, California area. A few minutes later a small cessna, flew  nearly the same distance and path as the object. The object I would estimate traveled at 3 times the speed of the plane. ???;33.9225;-117.5472
