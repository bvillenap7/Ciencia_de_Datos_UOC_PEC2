Single blue-white light traveling westbound at high rate of speed banking turns above Santa Ana river.;2007-01-27 18:30:00;2 minutes;Single blue-white light traveling westbound at high rate of speed banking turns above Santa Ana River. I observed a single blue-white point of light moving at a high rate of speed traveling in a westerly direction at a perceived altitude of approximately 600-800 feet.  I immediately pointed it out to my wife and we continued to watch the object make a wide banking turn from left to right and then back to the left again.  It then continued west until our view was obstructed.  Our first observation was that the only thing visible was a single, bright blue-white light, which dimmed very little even when we last observed it until approximately 3 miles away.  No colored or blinking lights could be seen from the multiple angles from which we observed. My first guess was that it could be a helicopter, but the speed was seemingly far too great for the perceived altitude, I could identify no other lighting, and the peculiar brightness of the object as distance increased. The object may have been following the Santa Ana River toward the ocean.  I am an amateur astronomer, computer specialist and NASA volunteer. My wife has no observing background.
