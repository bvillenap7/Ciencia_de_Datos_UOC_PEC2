Also that night, I myself and two other adults observed in the western sky, a blue-green large object that just came down from the sky and sat in the lower sky for at least 1/2 hour.  It would totally fade out, and then light back up.  It was unexplainable.  I also see lights that  fly around in the clouds that almost look like spot lights, but there is no begining or end to these lights, no place of origin as you would see with spot lights.  Anyone else seen anything like this in Riverside??? thanks all. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.9225;-117.5472
