Large Circular Structure hovering over south Riverside;2019-12-12 17:45:00;5 minutes;Large Circular Structure hovering over south Riverside Traveling on the 15 South from Limonite to 2nd Street in Norco.  Looking towrds the south-east, probably over Cajalco between the 15 and the 215 I saw what looked like a huge (mothership) in the sky.  It had a bright circlular light in the middle and five or six lights on either side.  You could make out a  large circular or rectangular structure.  Since I was driving, I couldn't look at it for my detail, but it was very large and hovering at about 10,000 feet alltitude.  By the time I got off the freeway, I could no longer see it.;33.9225;-117.5472
