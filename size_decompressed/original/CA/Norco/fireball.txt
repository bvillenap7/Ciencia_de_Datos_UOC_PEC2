fireball heading NE (towards Naval Weapons Center) in Norco;2007-03-18 19:00:00;10 seconds;fireball heading NE (towards Naval Weapons Center) in Norco Fireball moving in what appeared to be a NE direction- towards the naval weapons center in Norco. We were in our jacuzzi and looked up to see it cross the sky- watched it disappear over the rooftops towards the NE. Had two bright tails of orange/yellow, with a red center to the tail, and a bluish body. My husband saw something similar late January, heading to the west over the 15 freeway in Norco.;33.9225;-117.5472
