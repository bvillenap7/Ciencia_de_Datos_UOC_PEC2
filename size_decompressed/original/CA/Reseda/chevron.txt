Flashing red lights in chevron formation and rumbling sound in Los Angeles sky.;2016-11-07 17:50:00;2 minutes;Flashing red lights in chevron formation and rumbling sound in Los Angeles sky. I heard a loud rumbling sound like a rocket launch, but consistent and steady and much louder than an airplane or helicopter. I looked up in the sky and saw 5 or 6 pairs of red flashing lights in a chevron formation that seemed to be approx a quarter of a mile wide, moving slowly across the sky from north to south. As these lights passed overhead and to the south, the engine sound traveled with them. Very strange.;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
