Rectangle, no wings, no sound, no lights;2006-08-05 20:15:00;3 seconds;Rectangle, no wings, no sound, no lights August 5 2006 8:15 pm in the skys over th San Fernando valley I spoted a rectangular object 500 feet above me at dusk.  It had no wings, it made no sound and had no lights.  It was going very fast, I would estimate 500 mph + and what appeared in a perfect straight line.  From above me to over the horizon it took a mere 3-4 seconds.  Nobody else was with me and I had no camera, and if I had I would not have had the time to take a picture.;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
