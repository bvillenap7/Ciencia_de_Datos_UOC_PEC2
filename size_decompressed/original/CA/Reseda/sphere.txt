I witnessed this event on the evening of July 4, 1978.  This was on the rooftop of a friend, very near Reseda Park in the SFV.  I told my friend, We’re going to see a UFO tonight.  After the fireworks died down, and overhead aircraft thinned out, I turned around facing north and saw what looked like a red ruby in the sky, although its steady brilliance was like that of a red wine with light shining behind and through it.  I said to my friend, There it is, there’s the UFO I told you we would see. He said it was an airliner, but when he realized it wasn’t moving, he guessed it might be a blimp.  We were probably looking up at it 30 degrees.  It began moving toward the east, gradually, slowly, and then stopped.  It did this several times over a period of about ten minutes.  By the time it was in the SE sky, and suddenly became a pinpoint of light, my friend could not see it anymore, because he had taken his eyes off of it.  I was fixed on it.  I thought it might be rapidly ascending upward.  But after a few minutes, it suddenly manifested its original diameter and circumference.  It appeared as the original ruby red when we first saw it, changed to a brilliant orange, then to yellow, and lastly to a pure pearl white before disappearing.  About ten minutes later, it reappeared in a NE direction, and both my friend and I watched it suddenly shift from a round orb or oval to a red semi-circular arc, followed instantly by a neon-blue flash, before disappearing.  The event was reported in a local newspaper, and I was quoted in two paragraphs.  An airline pilot, I learned from the writer of the news article, who was not quoted in the paper, told the reporter that he had observed the UFO and estimated it was 250 feet in diameter.  My next door neighbor, and his friend from down the street, were standing in my front yard looking straight up at what he said was a very large brilliant orange ‘ball’ of light.  The reporter told me that some officials were saying college students from a local city ! college were releasing gas filled balloons, timed to go off.  But the steadiness of the colors, and the size of the object, as witnessed by my next-door neighbor, a professional pilot, and myself compel me to believe that this was not some prank, but a real UFO sighting.;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
star-like objects traveling east to west,30 seconds apart,high alt.,high speed, no tails or trails.;1999-08-25 15:30:00;30 min.;star-like objects traveling east to west,30 seconds apart,high alt.,high speed, no tails or trails. While sunbathing on a clear day at about 3:30 in the afternoon, I noticed what looked like a star traversing the sky from east to west at extremely high altitude and much faster than standard aircraft. It appeared to be slightly brighter than the brightest star one would see at night.There was one about every 30 seconds. Some of these changed directions.This went on for approx. 30 min.No trails, tails color or sound.Just balls of white light.I have about 10 minutes on Hi8 video. I'll transfer it to vhs and send you a copy.;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
What looked like a star, appeared to be flashing multi-colors and oscillating.;1999-10-26 01:40:00;2 hrs.;What looked like a star, appeared to be flashing multi-colors and oscillating. I looked up into the night sky and immediately noticed a star, about 10 degrees below the big dipper, was flashing from red to green to blue, very noticable. The colors were so bright I thought it might be a distant blimp putting on a light show. It turned out to be moving accross the sky at the same rate as the other stars, and according to my rangefinder, I was focused at infinite settings, beyond the moon. I shot about 45 minutes of this on video tape. It was, as far as I can tell, a star that was flashing many colors, something I've never seen or heard of before.;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
Green laser ball spontaneously appears at elevation of low-flying airplane, then almost zips away into black sky.;2013-10-15 20:35:00;<0.5 second;Green laser ball spontaneously appears at elevation of low-flying airplane, then almost zips away into black sky I was leaving my cousin's house and having a few last minutes in conversation with her on the porch.  I was looking at her face as we talked, and out of the corner of my eye I noticed something that captured my attention.  I reflexively and immediately shifted my gaze towards it, and I saw a bluish-green sphere of intense laser-like light, which must have appeared out of nowhere (because it was so bright that, had it been there before, I definitely would have noticed).  It was at an elevation of a low-flying helicopter, or an airplane that hasn't completed even the initial leg of its post-takeoff ascent.  Its bluish-green was similar in color neither to that of any falling star nor that of any comet I've ever seen. My knee-jerk reaction was to blurt out Whoa!, but it had disappeared even before I had finished the exclamation.  By it had disappeared, I mean I saw it zip away in a short streak of its intense bluish-green light, at a speed exponentially faster than any aircraft (commercial, recreational, military, or otherwise) I've ever seen.  The laser light ball jetted from its stationary position like a Star Wars spaceship jumping to light speed or entering hyperspace after an unbelievably quick (in time) and short (in distance) dart, it literally looked like it teleported into the blackness of the sky, but on a very straight trajectory. Unfortunately, only I saw this and not my cousin, who was with me but facing the wrong way.  The next day at work, the industrial photocopy machine I have used daily for the past three years inexplicably shut itself off twice when I touched it, which I cannot recall it otherwise ever doing in the past three years I've worked with it.  (The office tech guys denied remotely rebooting it, and I have no reason to disbelieve them, especially since they were unaware of my sighting the previous night, the knowledge of which may have made them prone to playing such a prank on me.);34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
