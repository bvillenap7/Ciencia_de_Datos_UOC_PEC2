Fireball on top of church steeple.;2012-08-19 20:00:00;3 seconds;Fireball on top of church steeple. At or around 7:00PM on August 19th, 2012. I was walking Westbound on Sherman Way. I was at the intersection of Sherman Way and Lindley in Reseda.  I was looking NorthEast towards St. Catherine of Siena church.  I was looking towards the church steeple, directly above the cross that sits on the top of the roof. A very large, very bright fuzzy orange ball appeared on top of the cross.  It appeared to be about 50 feet NorthEast of the cross.  Just as suddenly as it appeared, it disappear.  It almost seem to collapse into itself. It's interesting to note that I felt what I can only describe as warmth emanating from this object.  I felt it, even as I was at about 200 feet from it.;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
