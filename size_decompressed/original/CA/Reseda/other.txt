The object appeared as a bright light stationary in the sky for around 1 minute.  I immediately grabbed my 7X50 binoculars to get a better look at the object.  The object then faded to a very dim light and proceeded at a high rate of speed in a northerly direction.  There was no sound and the object appeared to be at an extremely high altitude at all times.  I lost track of the object as it passed over the mountains north of my location.;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
