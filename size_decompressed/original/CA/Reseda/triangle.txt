I said to my husband what is that, he looked out and tlod our family menbers to look at the sky. It was a V- shape formation. My husband took out the video carmera and started to recording. There was no other aircraft flying around. We normally have planes flying over our house in a eastern direction, this was going at a north to south direction. The center light was bright and the other lights began to dimer out as if they were separating from the formation. It flew over our heads not moving very fast, we could hear a motor type noise, but it was not a noise that an airplane makes, it kept flying south, but it disappeared once it passed the moon. I was on the phone with my sister and the aircraft flew over the phone went dead and the video camera stopped. It was really weird.;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
Triangle-shape with three smaller triangles at each corner glowing fuzzy Orange.;2011-12-06 18:00:00;20 sec.;Triangel shape with three smaller triangles at each corner glowing fuzzy Orange. Last night Dec. 6th 2011 at 6:30 pm PST. I was sky watching, the Moon and Jupiter were in very close proximity in the night sky makes for a very good observations.  I also watch for passing Satellites just after sundown this time is best for viewing.   I was facing West with my 50X100 binoculars looking almost straight up Coming from behind me I noticed what I thought was a orange fuzzy light just on the edge of my field of view through the binoculars, quickly I move the object into full view and I saw a triangle shape object, there were three much smaller Triangle shapes at each corner all facing in the direction of flight. The small Triangles lightly glowing a fuzzy orange, no sound at all I could see this for almost 20 Sec. then it went out of range and gone.  There was what seemed to be a translucent structure to the larger  Triangle and inside the middle I could see through to the Star field.

Strange reddish orange lights in a triangular pattern spotted in the Southwest sky over Los Angeles, 3/25/16.;2016-03-25 22:00:00;5-7 minutes;Strange reddish orange lights in a triangular pattern spotted in the Southwest sky over Los Angeles, 3/25/16. I received a phone call from my Nephew at approximately 10:00 PM Friday March 25, 2016, telling me to look low in the southwest sky of Los Angeles.  Something caught his wifeâ€™s eye and she stated that those look like funny lights coming from planes. Her husband stated that those are not planes.  At that time there were three reddish orange lights in a triangular pattern.  By the time I got outside to see for myself one had disappeared.  I viewed myself as the last two disappeared.  They appeared to be hovering and not crossing the horizon.  As I watched they appeared to be pulsating irregularly.   My nephew is a caregiver, his wife a book keeper, and I'm a Network Administrator.;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202

I just figured the moon was unusually bright tonight.  Less than 2 minutes later I am on Reseda Blvd and this giant pure bright white light is coming closer and closer following the path of the boulevard.  The light was brighter than anything I've seen, I first thought it could be a plane or maybe a helicopter using a sheriff spotlight but as I drove forward and it approached it became clear this was too bright to be any sort of familiar craft.  It looked like it was moving slowly, but once I was under it and saw the brightness and size of the craft, it had to be moving at an incredible speed, also considering I had seen it near the mountain range which is over 45 minutes away and in a minute it is now above me.  I slowed down trying to reach for my phone and soon I wa! s underneath it.  Two other cars were pulled over and were outside their cars looking up at whatever this thing was.  As i was now directlynunder it Iooked up and it was a triangular shaped craft made of this strange black material that camouflaged well with the night sky. The bright light was not visible from this angle which was also odd, no light was visibly emitted from my point of view beneath it.  It had a small light on two points of the triangle.  It looked like the bnody if the craft was made of panels of that unique black material.  I stopped dead in the street (it was almost 3 am) and stared up at it thru my windshield.  It seemed to know I was looking up because it just hovered over me and I began to drive off because i know had the chills.  I looked in my rear view mirror and it was no where to be seen.  The craft was silent but seemed to be observing me and its surroundings;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
