Semi-Circular shaped object with blue lights.;2014-09-09 21:37:00;~1 minute;Semi-Circular shaped object with blue lights. It was a semi-circular object w/ blue lights gliding thru sky.  I had look 3 or 4 times to understand what I was seeing.  (It also had red lights in background).   I looked around (lots of other people were looking up), and when I looked back up,  It changed shape, from semi-circular to square, going back and forth north, southeast, and West.   Then, I looked at the car next to me, and the female driver was also gawking at the sky.  I asked her if she knew what it was, she didnt.  When I looked back, was gone.   We all went separate ways...I went home.;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
