I was on my way to my car yesterday evening to grab the rest of my groceries I looked up at the stars for a moment, and saw a light moving slowly in the sky. The light looked to be about 2 miles NE, possibly above the Granada Hills area. When I looked at it, it zoomed North, away from me, faster than any plane, drone, or satellite could.;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
