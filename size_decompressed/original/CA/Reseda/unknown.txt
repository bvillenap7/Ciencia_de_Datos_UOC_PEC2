It was a clear night, the date above is an approximation. I saw an object, shape unkown, perform manouvers which seemed to defy the laws of physics. I saw a lighted object, perhaps eight lights in all. It seemed to be literally tumbling across the sky. It would go from the West end of the San Fernando Valley to the east end, and then back again. It did so very rapidly, and with no noise discernible to me. The strangest thing about its journeys, (even more strange than its speed an silence) was the fact that when it stopped, it stopped almost as if it was at the end of a pendulum swing, and then it swung back. I am a licensed private investigator, and a trained observer. I have above average intelligence, and am not prone to seeing things.;34.2297604913002;-118.525727226202
