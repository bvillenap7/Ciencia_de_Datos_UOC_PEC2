It moved away on a 45 degree angel and changed shape.  It appeared to have flames around the bottom and bright light in the middle with florescent green.  It zig zagged and moved up into the sky until it just disapeared. We took video of the object.  We were watching tv in our living room which has a large sliding glass door.  We saw the strange sphere and run out on our porch where we watched it and videoed it.;41.7816999999996;-124.133199999998
