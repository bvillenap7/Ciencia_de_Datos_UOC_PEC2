bright object appears in sky, then disappears in a mega second.;2003-09-21 20:05:00;micro-sec;bright object appears in sky, then disappears in a mega second. the object was a bright round light.  i could not tell if it was flat .  i was gazing west and looking at what i think is mercury.  the light just all at once was there in the sky, moving north in a parallel line. my vision was unassisted. the object appeared from out of nowhere.  it was just there,   approximately 8ft. to the north of mercury, and it travelled 1ft. in my field of vision, still going in a straight line.  there was something odd. i knew it wasn't a shooting star.  i recall it being brighter that mercury. the unsettling thing was the object wasn't traveling in an arc.  it was just there then it wasn't.;41.7816999999996;-124.133199999998
