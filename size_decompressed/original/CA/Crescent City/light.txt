unexplainable white light  above the mountain, flashing it blue, all animals making noises.;1996-01-01 01:30:00;30 minutes;unexplainable white light  above the mountain, flashing it blue, all animals making noises. I was 8 years old and living inside a single bedroom motel with my 2 brothers and mother( she was on drugs), It was valley view motel, in smith river, a few minutes from the bigger City Crescent city. At 12:00-3:00, i woke up to my mom walking me and my brothers out to the front yard. It was a bright white light, it was spraying the whole mountain with a blue flash every 10 or 15 seconds. It was so bright white, that the glow around it was like beams. It sounded like a stampeed, but with loud birds and forest animals. Every kind of animal sound I think. Down the sidewalk was a black kitten spinnning in circles. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));41.7816999999996;-124.133199999998

Right after getting out of the movies at around 9 PM, I was walking towards my car in the parking lot and noticed a very bright light out towards the west-northwest.  I got in my car and drove to the beach to investigate (about two minutes away) and got out of my car and walked down on the beach.  The light was orangish and very bright.  I thought it was a planet at first(as bright as Jupiter) but Jupiter was straight up above me, along with another minor planet.  Watching the light, I noticed it was moving in a northerly direction very slowly over the ocean, and in the meantime descending gradually.  At that moment I assumed it was a plane coming in to land at the airport here, but it never approached the airport. I then drove north along Pebble Beach Drive to another pullout where I sat awhile, and to my astonishment the object began to move up and down and began to slightly accelerate at certain moments (the object was still very far in the distance) and then it would slow again.  At this instant I just knew it wasn't a plane.  The light then began to appear brighter, and then fade again, where it faded altogether and didn't reappear. I drove down to the end of the road to Point St. George to see if it had appeared again, but the sky was pitch black and there was no light to be seen.  I know there were other vehicles driving along Pebble Beach at the time, and I know someone else must have seen what I had seen--it was too bright to ignore it.;41.7816999999996;-124.133199999998
