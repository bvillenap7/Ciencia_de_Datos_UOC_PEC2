Orange object over Crescent City glowed like a burning fireplace log.;1998-02-09 23:30:00;20 minutes;Orange object over Crescent City glowed like a burning fireplace log. Note: Picture, if you will, the ever-changing colors of a burning log in a fireplace. These colors change from to dull cherry red to a bright orange, and the intensity of these glowing embers would vary, as well. At the approximate time stated above, I had departed the local theater for home. Heading west on the main thoroughfare for home, I was attracted to this kind of orange glow (as stated above). It seemed to have a flat odd appearance. I indicated rectangle! The shape seemed square but it did seem to change slightly, I guess due to the change in variation in these colors. The night time sky was clear, and a slight breeze was coming from the south. This object was going south. I followed it all the to the overlook at the Battery Point lighthouse vista point. This object veered southwest and drifted out to sea and disappeared into the night.;41.7816999999996;-124.133199999998
