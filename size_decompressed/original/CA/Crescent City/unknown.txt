Large, bright object straight up and very high could be seen for 1/2 hour never moving until covered by clouds.;2014-05-03 18:00:00;1/2 hour;Large, bright object straight up and very high could be seen for 1/2 hour never moving until covered by clouds. I cannot tell you the shape of the object because it was extremely high. My husband called me to come outside.  When I went out he said look up.    When I looked up it took me a moment to find it and then I saw an extremely bright roundish object way up high in the sky.   At first I thought it was a balloon but it was VERY windy and it never moved.  It stayed in the same place for as long as we watched it, about 1/2 an hour until the clouds covered it up.  It was VERY bright and stationary and when I looked for it the next day it was gone.  Was there anything in the sky during daylight that day that we might have seen?;41.7816999999996;-124.133199999998
Saw 30 flying objects in equal formaiton moving rapidly high like planes from N to S.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-03 21:40:00;20 minutes;Saw 30 flying objects in equal formaiton moving rapidly high like planes from North to South in the Western sky May 3, 2020 at 2140. Approximately 2140 my husband and I were in spa on deck when I looked up and saw what I thought was a plane. My husband said it was moving too fast to be a plane. We saw 30 of these moving objects in formation of equal distance appearing from the same area in the sky, one after another in a row, steady and looked like evenly spaced. It was a clear night, we could see plenty of stars and also a couple of planes. We could not see them off in the distance as the moon was bright. May 3, 2020 with full moon in a few days. We heard a rumble like planes in the distance but we are also near the Pacific Ocean so it was not clear if the rumble was from the air travel. We looked to see if they were repeating a formation like some type of training but could not see that. They seemed to come out of nowhere in the same area and go off into the South. Coming from the North to South in the Western sky above my home.;41.7816999999996;-124.133199999998
Straight line of lights in sky moving east,;2021-02-01 05:24:00;2 minutes;straight line of lights in sky moving east, 5:17am started coffee. 5:24 went to east facing window to have a smoke. Weather was dark night/slightly overcast stars visible  Observed a straight horizontal string of 12-15 evenly spaced moving white lights.Moving east with slight south trajectory. Went to get old iPad to take video, hoping to get lucky(no low light capability)No luck all black. Then saw a second string identical to first emerging from cloud cover further east. Approximate distance between them was 2x length of first string. Sighting was less than 2 minutes. 5:24-5:26am. I then then went to flight tracker / no aircraft within 200 miles. Went to  google maps to plot trajectory of flight path. My assumption was towards Mt. Shasta + or - 150 miles . Due to the identical structure of  both strings, I think think odds are good that they were 2 craft(I was seeing one side) not 25- 30 craft. The only reason I am reporting this is I hope for another witness. This is a remote area. Whatever happene! d was not staged for public consumption at this area or time/unlike phenix lights.;41.7816999999996;-124.133199999998
