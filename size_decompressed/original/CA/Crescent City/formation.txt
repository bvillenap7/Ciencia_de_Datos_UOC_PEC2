Thought to be a cluster of five stars soon changed after about five seconds. These five points of light were moving with-in paramenters they set for themselves. They were changing the'yre positions to different points...very quickly. So fluenlty infact,,they're movement looked like they were acting as one, trying to create 3D looking shapes. They would buzz around like flies within a cluster...then STOP..FROZEN, but in another perfect looking 3D shape.(as if you could connect the dots, with your eye's).. The shapes had depth. Thats what convinced me they were trying to make us see...shapes....simple 3D shapes...these lights had pilot's inside....they had supreme intellingence and total understanding of they're whereabouts in space, and they're positions apart from each other within the cluster. They were performing arial stunts..like birds mating...UNBELIEVABLE!! To describe how far away they were......If you look into a clear night sky...you can always see what looks to be sattelites whizing across the sky....they only go in one direction..either left to right or right to left...these lights were the same distance away from me...they were far away...but very close at the same time, almost too close....... I watched them as if I was watching kids play in a playground...It looked a a science fiction movie, or a java-applet..on your computer....I didn't want them to go..they did....they just moved on...peacefully. With-out a doubt..in my mind......I am 110 percent positive..this was nothing made from human technology. I'm a smart person...I have perfect eye sight.....I would laugh in anybody's face, that told me I was seeing an illusion. Maybe if we all just took a moment out of our busy lives, and looked into the skies...maybe we would all learn something or two!;41.7816999999996;-124.133199999998
Eight lights in V pattern traveling from east to west in seconds dissapearing over the ocean;2020-03-21 22:21:00;3 seconds;Eight lights in V pattern traveling from east to west in seconds dissapearing over the ocean On Saturday evening at around 10:15 pm I stepped out on my deck as usual to look up at the stars and noticed approx 8 or so lights traveling in a V flight formation from east to west over the pacific ocean.  The lights were not bright but very distinct and at the rate of speed they where moving, it seemed it was only a couple of seconds as they traveled the visible night sky from east to west before I lost track of them over the pacific.  In that V Pattern and at that rate of speed each individual light was pulsing within that V as they travelled.  After that evening I discovered there were other reports in my area within that time frame describing similar viewings.  Something's going down man!  A true mind blower!;41.7816999999996;-124.133199999998
