craft with blinking colored lights flying faster than any object known.;1997-09-19 22:00:00;all night;craft with blinking colored lights flying faster than any object known. I was on the fishing vessel ((Name deleted)), albacore fishing 300 miles offshore of San Francisco California when I and all three other crew members aboard spotted a blightly lit object in the sky. The object flew across the sky so fast, that it looked like a meteorite. But it had red, orange, green and blue colored lights flashing rapidly around it. Then another similar object appeared. The two objects flew back and forth across the sky all night. They did not get close enough to make out a shape but sometimes they zipped away so rapidly that it was like a streak. Activity continued all night long. The deck hands reported to me that once during the night a craft without lights flew low over the boat. The next morning our boat passed by the Abraham Lincoln air craft carrier. Note that often UFO activity is reported in conjunction with military activity. Upon arriving home, in Astoria Oregon in October, my neighbor, who works in a local cafe told me that she overheard a conversation with people who said they had seen a UFO while out on a boat. I am interested to find other people who have reported similar incidents in the same vicinity.;41.7816999999996;-124.133199999998
