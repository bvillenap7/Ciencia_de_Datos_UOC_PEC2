Noticed red lights to the north of Simi appearing to be in the mountains, girlfriend thought she was seeing Magic Mountain;1977-06-01 22:00:00;15 min.;Noticed red lights to the north of Simi appearing to be in the mountains, girlfriend thought she was seeing Magic Mountain Object had all red lights around edge, and hovered for 5min. Then all red lights went out and a few stayed on others blinked making it look like a plane as it went south towards a rocket engine testing sight called Rocket-Dyne, as it got over Rocket-Dyne all lights once again returned as it hovered for a few min. The object appeared to be disc shaped with a sail shaped rotating apparatus on top with lights at the points. This object never made a sound and was no more than 1000ft in the sky. As this object moved south it did so at about the speed as a plane. When it left it did so very fast, looking like a blue streak, you could not follow it, it was gone in a second, still never making a sound. This has been a long time ago, but I still remember all the details, this is really the first time I have had an opportunity to document it. Hoping there are others who witnessed the same object.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245

Object is not dissimilar to the appearance of a twin-engine, high-wing turboprop aircraft, in our opinion, but the image is ambiguous, we feel.  If people witnessed, and noted, the object at the time of the sighting and photographs, then it may not be an aircraft.  PD));34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245

We thought it was a helicopter at first but as it came closer and closer to us we looked at the object very close and it was in the shape of circle .  It has quite and could not hear any noise as you would a helicopter or airplane.  In the shape of the circle object it had four smaller circleâ€™s flashing color lights, one blinked like a clear color and the other blueish red. As we got home and parked the car we got out and saw others flying in different directions, but a couple of them came close to one another and one passed by quicker than the other.  It stayed like this as I have described above me for about thirty minutes.   I tried to take a picture but my camera could not focus as far as my binocular could.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
