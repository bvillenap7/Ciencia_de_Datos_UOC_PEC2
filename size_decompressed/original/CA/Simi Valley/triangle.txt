Massive triangular aircraft flying over Simi Valley hills at 9pm;2007-07-25 21:00:00;30 seconds;Massive triangular aircraft flying over Simi Valley hills at 9pm I was in my front yard with my little sister, looking at the moon, when all of the sudden I see this massive triangular aircraft flying over the hills. There were big white lights all along the edges, this is how I know it was a triangle. I shouted to my little sister to look, and she kept telling me it was only a plane, calm down. But there was no way it was an airplane. It was way to close to the ground, and it was very clearly triangular. It was behind the hills and out of sight in about thirty seconds. I ran inside and told my mom, but she told me I was a moron.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
Discovered UFOs in my Photos;2009-03-17 11:00:00;5 min;Discovered UFOs in my Photos I was taking pictures of the sky as I always do especially this day, March 17th, since it was so clear and bright.  The weather was perfect. I was enjoying the day, seated in the patio, working with my PC.   Then I heard and saw a green helicopter flying low and I tried to photograph it, but couldn't because because I had to adjust the zoom and could nto be fast enough, so I kept taking photos of the sky, towards the mountains and freeway 118, farther away.  Later upon examining all the photos in my PC, I saw the object that looks like a saucer, shiny surface and all. (This is a crop of the original, zoomed-in photo.)   Later in the afternoon, I heard another chopper, went out, and there was the same green one.  I tried again, but it was too low to focus and I had my camera in zoom to take photos of distant objects, so I could not catch it.  Again, I continued to take pictures of the sky at random.  I waved goodbye to the green chopper as it went behind the trees and out of sight. The photos in the afternoon pictures look like triangular objects, I am sure these cannot be birds at a distance they would have to be gigantic to photograph this way. The saucer like object photo was taken in the morning.  The afternoon photos show dark triangular objects.  The photos were taken with a Canon Powershot G10 digital camera.  (This camera has a maximum resolution of 14.7 mega-pixels.)   Since that day I have taken more photos and some days I have caught cylindrical, triangular and cigar shaped object.  For 2 years of doing this I did not discover any strange objects in my photos but they are becoming a weekly thing.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
Triangle shaped craft with three bright lights seen over Simi Valley,Ca.;2009-08-21 05:00:00;less than 30sec;Triangle shaped craft with three bright lights seen over Simi Valley,Ca. The objects were triangle in shape,three lights on each,I saw one first going from north to south very slowly( slower than an airplane and no bleaking lights)and then it disappeared. The other one then appeared in the same spot going in the opposite direction,it also had three lights on it and moving slowly from south to north then it disappeared.  The whole event lasted less than 30 seconds.  I waited a good amount of time to see if they would come back but they did not.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
