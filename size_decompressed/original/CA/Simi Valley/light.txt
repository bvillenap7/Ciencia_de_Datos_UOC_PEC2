Large lighted silhouette of a face in the sky.;1976-06-15 20:00:00;20 minutes;Large lighted silhouette of a face in the sky. I'm fairly certain this was in 1976. It is similar to the sighting in Thousand Oaks posted for 1/15/76. Simi is just a few miles from Thousand Oaks. It was a warm evening, and I was out in the front yard with my parents. I was about 14. We were just sitting there talking and enjoying the evening. I was looking up at the sky and the stars and saw something in the sky to the west.  I'll describe it as a light, because that is what it would most closely resemble. It was more like a grayer area of the sky, but translucent enough to see the stars through it. The frightening thing is that it was shaped like the typical devil face outline complete with horns and a grimacing mouth. At first we thought it was being projected by one of those big searchlights they used to use for grand openings, etc., but there was no beam of light visible coming up from the ground.  My dad was working for Rockwell at the time, but not up at Rocketdyne. He was trying to figure out what was causing this quite obvious shape in the sky, and was getting pretty upset. My mom was just quiet and looked scared. We watched it for about 20 minutes, and it never changed or moved in any way. I don't know what size it was, but it was bigger than my hand as I held it up .  We watched it for awhile and then went inside. I was assuming there was some logical explanation, and we would read about it in the paper the next day, but as far as I know, nobody else saw or reported it.  Even stranger, about a month or so later, I was outside with some friends at about the same time, and was telling them about what I had seen, and described the shape. One of my friends pointed up and said do you mean like that?....and there it was again, in the same place. We all watched it for a few minutes, and it gradually faded and was no longer visible.  The only indication I have ever had that anyone else saw this was a drawing on the cover of a Weekly Reader type newspaper they used to hand out at school. The paper came out a year or so later, but had an article about UFO sightings, etc. inside. The cover drawing depicted a night sky with the exact same shape in it, and I believe whoever drew it must have seen the same thing as I did. It was accompanied by the caption Are We Alone? or something similar. I kept that copy for many years, but can no longer find it.  I believe the poster from Thousand Oaks saw the same thing or something similar. I asked my parents about it a few years ago, but they don't remember it at all. Strange.

Crafts were appx. 10 miles away and appx. 30,000 feet or more high.  Sun had set and was reflecting off bottom of crafts.  Have seen same light from commercial airliners.  Craft would not have been seen by eye without sun reflecting off bottom(s) Estimated speed: 3 to 5 thousand m.p.h.  One made a 90 degree drop about 1 mile in a split second, continued for 3 seconds, then another split second 90 degree turn back to origional position.  Continued until flickering out from losing reflection from sun. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that datein 1976 is approximate.  PD));34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
5 MILE High Laser Beam,  guarded by AMSEC/SAIC,  International Security Corp.;1995-10-20 22:00:00;MANY HOURS;5 MILE High Laser Beam,  guarded by AMSEC/SAIC,  International Security Corp. http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=chatsworth,+ca&ie=UTF8&om=1&ll=34.231727,-118.797741&spn=0.01123,0.016265&z=16   I saw a beam of light from Hollywood at 10PM as I drove home to Simi Valley. The Beam was brighter than the Lexor in Las Vegas. After driving for 45 mins  I could see that the beam was coming from the far west end of Simi, its source was a mile or two from the Regan Library. You could see the beam from 50 miles. The source was in a small valley in the hills at the end of the Wood Ranch Parkway. The beam looked like a blue white laser and shot up five miles with no flaring out or diffusion.  I drove to the nearest place I could and found several other cars driving past a guard blocking a fire road into the hills. I asked the guard what was going on, what was that light?  He said they were making a video for MTV and told me to leave.  He had no badge, no plates in the car, no logo on his jeep, he was not a cop. Three days later I walked up that fire road and found a warning sign, International Security Corp., AMSEC. SEE PHOTO. AMSEC was owned by SAIC. What I found was interesting, and a large depression in the dirt, burned grass and an area 50ft x 50ft square of small quarts rocks with perfect 90 degree corners. 18 wheeler truck tire marks in the mud and small metal filings. Oh, and a security guard in a white Bronco way up on the hill watching me, and a few cows. I checked with Simi Valley city hall and there was no movie permits issued for any area at that time for any movie or video production. I want to know what this light beam was. It looked to be a 50 foot wide laser beam that went up 5 miles. This all took place 5 or 10 days after seeing a fireball fly over the valley.  Why was a spy satellite builder guarding a cow pasture?  Was this a possible UFO crash site and recovery?  Or a test of some kind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245

The light went out and no red or green lights were visible.  A minute later the light reappeared and repeated the same sequence.  When it extinguished the second time it disappeared in a different fashion.  It went out much like an aerial fireworks does...in segments, in an upwards direction. There were four people in my car.  My wife was driving.  My 10 and 7 year old sons were in the back seat.  I was in the front passenger seat.  My wife told the boys that they had just seen a meteor.  The boys told mom that meteors don't stay stationary in the sky and then fade out.  I told my wife that I had seen the light disappear twice in a two minute period of time.  We all decided to watch the news tonight to see if there was anything on the sighting.  Unfortunately, we missed watching the news tonight.  In all probability they would not have covered it anyway.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245

Three star-like lights traveling in formation West to East that disappear.;2005-08-12 00:00:00;15 seconds;Three star-like lights traveling in formation West to East that disappear. On August 12, 2005 about midnight, my wife and I were up to watch the Perseid meteor shower.  We were lying on our backs on our trampoline in the back yard of our Simi Valley, CA home.    At approximately the same time, we both noticed three lights, no brighter than the brightest visible stars, moving from West to East.  I first thought them to be satellites, but they did not move in a straight line and I did not think satellites would travel together in a set of three.  Next, I thought they might be a high-flying formation of military aircraft.  The middle one was out in front of the other two.  However, they were jostling around and did not remain in a tight formation.  We watched them for about 10-15 seconds.  Then when they were at about 80-85 degrees from vertical, the lights simply vanished.  I cannot explain why the lights went out if they were standard airplane lights.  It is possible that the objects were at high enought altitude to still be catching reflection from the sun and then passed far enough to the East that the sun went under their horizon.  I am not sure how high they would have to be to still be catching rays from the sun at midnight, however.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245

Strange yellow oval of light weaving at sharp angles, definitely not any type of plane or helicopter.;2006-06-05 23:57:00;5 minutes;Strange yellow oval of light weaving at sharp angles, definitely not any type of plane or helicopter. As a security officer on patrol during the graveyard shift I noticed a very strange light in the sky over Simi Valley. I was at the intersection of Royal and First St. and saw a light that was definitely not like an airplane, it was too large, the color was more yellow and completely steady (not flashing). The light appeared to be circular but slightly oval with barely visible light lines darting from the most accute point of the oval. The light moved very slowly and made a zig zag pattern in the sky that was definitely not that of an airplane. The light was definitely unlike any helicopter light (again, not flashing) and that is the only other flying object it might have been judging by it's pattern of flight (ability to weave back and forth at sharp angles).I was only able to witness this for five minutes, from 23:57 on 6/5/06 to 00:02 on 6/6/06. I had to continue my patrol and felt I would appear foolish to call in a UFO sighting to my dispatch center or local law enforcement.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
Satalite does a 180 deg in night sky.;2006-10-18 21:48:00;6 seconds;Satalite does a 180 deg in night sky. I saw some thing very interesting tonight.  At aprox 9:48 pm, give or take a few minutes, on 10-18-06, I saw what I thought was a very faint satellite.  There was no moon in the sky and the sky was fairly black.  I just happened to look almost straight up, just a little to the west I think, and a very small satellite caught my eye.  This object was traveling at approximately the same speed as one would expect from a satellite.   After traveling approximately 4-6 arc degrees in a straight line, the object turned 180 degrees in about a 3-4 arc distance.  It did not appear to slow down.  Shortly there after I lost sight of it because it was so dim.  I am basing the size of the moon as 1 arc.  Sorry if this is wrong.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
Light travelling, turning.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Iridium satellite.  PD));2007-03-24 20:35:00;30 to 45 seconds;Light travelling, turning. I was lying on my hammock in my backyard looking North/West at Orions Belt at 08:35 pm. when a dim light treked through my line of sight.  As I followed it, it staggered and grew brighter for a second, sped up, dimmed back to original illumination [like a star or satellite] it kept travelling north to south but with noticeable mini 'S' turns included in its flight.  It kept going same speed, same turns, same direction until it faded out of sight to the south.  Thank You.

An amber light northeast of Simi Valley, shined VERY clearly through cloud coverage, suspended in 1 place for at least 20 minutes, before another smaller light descended from the original. After it's descent, it took approx. 20 seconds for the 2nd light to disappear, and when it did, it did not appear to change in size, it just disappeared. The 2nd light remained, but it was now 2 smaller amber lights, instead of 1 large light. This light remained still, for 2 minutes before heading north, and ultimately out of site.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245

Bright light seen from stable most early eves from afar...is not aircraft!!  Appears to greet us? ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet??

Appears to greet us? and then watch us awhile. 2010-2011...NE sky seen from South Simi Bridle Path area.  Our UFO started appearing about a year ago over the horizon/overlook we have from our horses' stables.  It began as a story the kids began running and telling us after feeding time, and confirmed by me, many times by now, always at or just after dusk. It is just one extra bright star at dusk or shortly after dark falls, that one could say opens it's eye, suddenly, as we are about to go down the final walkway to the stable breezeway...JUST LIKE IT HAS SEEN US COMING AND WOKE IT UP?   That is the part I can't get over or explain.  The white star will watch us, with no other airplane lights, i.e., no red/blue or any colors involved on it, compared to LAX /BURBANK planes that soar over us many times while visiting our horses and while the star watches us, rarely moving.  It is absolutely NOT a plane, NOT a star.  I have made sure of that because I feel silly enough about writing this. Many times, the light gets bored?, moves slowly sideways or upways for awhile, with no particular agenda, and then at last shuts off gently,and the show is always over just before we finish up our equine chores! So wierd!  Looked at it with binocs one night and it looked pretty far away and it seemed made of about five or six smaller stars but I can't be sure.  Wonder if anyone else has seen it?

Descending light South of 118 freeway;2012-04-26 21:22:00;8 min;descending light South of 118 freeway At 21:22 my sister and I noticed a pulsating light south of the 118 Ronald Reagen freeway. The pulsating light moved up and down and displayed a light that changed from purple/red to blue, a spectrum of color, like a rainbow.  My husband thought it was a star but I used my Google sky and the light was south east of the moon, white there were no displayed or obvious stars or constellations.  I watched several other woodcrafts fly pass the pulsating light.  The light then faded away about 21:30. At 22:48 my sister was looking out our patio door window which only faces South, screamed It's back!. My husband ,sister and myself then witnessed a light with two points illuminating the color of a very vibrant and dark red color.  It descended down South of the 118 free way.  It had no sound, moved extremely fast, and was very eerie for my family and I to see. I took photos with 12.1 mega pixel sony camera.  I have my bachelor degree in psychology, my husband works at a! airline valve company and my sister is a high school student.  The light at 21:48 descended down in tremendous speed and could only been seen for a min.

Three orange lights in a triangular formation hovered over my neighborhood for several minutes and disappeared last night.;2013-04-05 20:00:00;20 minutes;Three orange lights in a triangular formation hovered over my neighborhood for several minutes and disappeared last night. Electrical power went out in our neighborhood at 8:00 PM, so it was quite dark in the night sky. My next-door neighbor was on Facebook on his phone when he saw a posting from another neighbor, XXXX, down the street about the unidentified lights in the sky.  So XXX, my next-door neighbor, went outside to look at what XXXX was writing about.  Dan got very excited and called me and my husband outside, to see the lights.  They appeared in the north sky in an equilateral triangle formation, with one light at the apex of the triangle and two at the bottom.  The lights were orange in color and looked rather like flames or that they were shimmering.  All three lights hovered in the triangular pattern for a few minutes, and then it appeared that the two lights at the bottom of the triangle were growing dimmer until they finally disappeared.  I ran into the house and got a pair of binoculars, through which I viewed the remaining light. It was still a bit blurry for me, so I! gave the binoculars to my husband. He said the remaining light appeared to be an array of parallel lights numbering 4 on each side, with a white light on the top and bottom of the array, in the middle of the parallel.  The remaining light began to move slowly west in the sky for several minutes until it too, disappeared. When the lights disappeared, it looked like they were turning sideways until they were no longer visible.  At no time did any of us hear any sound and the lights did not move quickly.  There were a few distant airplanes in the sky, whose blinking running lights appeared quite different from these orange lights.  Another of XXX’s friends, whom he called, also saw the lights from a different perspective about a quarter mile away from our house.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245

Expecting it to be an airplane I kept watching for the Red and green flashing lights but the closer it got the more brilliant the became.  As it was just about over my home it slowed down when I realized it was neither a helicopter (No Sound) nor was it and airplane (no sound and no flashers) i called my dad outside.  He came out just in time to watch the craft make a slight turn east and accelerate straight up through a cloud and out of the atmosphere we watched the light decrease in size relative to a street light becoming the size of a christmas light in less then ten seconds.  The speed and acceleration without a sound was absolutely amazing.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
