There were multiple objects that hovered and accelerated at lightning fast speed.;1978-08-15 02:00:00;30 min;There were multiple objects that hovered and accelerated at lightning fast speed. we were in our early teens in a local park around 2 am when i observed a small light over the mountains. shortly after 3 then 4 then another appeared.We sat motionless for awhile and observed what we thought to be airplanes and then helecopters as we then noticed they were not moving. These lights were small dots along the horizon in a random formation and accelerating rapidlly and comming to an abrupt stop! This would go on intermitanlly for about 10-15 min.We all knew that these objects could'nt have been created by any earthly technology.We stood around mezmorized, our eyes fixated at these objects when all of a sudden, one by one, they accelerated like a blink of light out of the atmosphere and into space.We were later informed that Rocketdyne, where they test the shuttle engines, was up on that same mountain top. PS. this story is not made up! Yhis really happened.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245

When at 1:19 am in the moring when we both seened a Fire ball in the South-West sky which looked like a meteor then changed shape and hover above us. On the moring of 03-12-00, I was waiting outside in front of Denny's located at 590 E Los Angeles Av. Simi Valley, Ca. for a friend to show up, which she did at 1:19 pm. At that moment, we both seen a white/orange fire ball with a tail approx. 20 times longer the the Dim. of the object in the South-west sky heading toward us. To me, it looked like a meteor going through the lower atmosphere,or an airplane with it's wing on fire. This lasted approx. 2 minutes. then the odject turn into a white dot with a blue haze around it and slowed down very fast. That this point the odject was almost above us in the clear early morning sky. Then the odject stop above us at a high altitude for approx. 3 to 4 minutes it turn into a hazes red ball, and faded away into the morning sky. .;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245

I was driving on Route 118 north of Simi Valley, CA. at 3:36 a.m.  I saw a green fireball/round object about the size of an orange held at arms length, fly over my car and continue in the same direction.  I slowed down and lost sight of it. The greenish light around it seemed fuzzy.  I experienced a few blown fuses in my car within the next hour.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
Bright lights and glowing ball seen over Simi Valley, Ca..;2005-09-22 19:28:00;6-8 min;Bright lights and glowing ball seen over Simi Valley, Ca.. I was recently watching a documentary on the History Chanel. During this documentary a photo of an unusual occurance in the sky was shown via photograph. I immediately reacted. Myself, my husband, and my daughter had just seen the exact same occurance. I however, caught the whole incident via digital camcorder. My daughter was also taking photos whiled I was recording. The sun was set and it was dark. My husband was out cleaning the inside of his vehicle. I was out talking to him when this amazing zig zag of lights appeared in the sky. The zig zag displayed several bright colores in a trail floating behind a bright object glowing as though it was on fire. We were all amazed! None of us had seen anything like it. Even my non believing, skeptical, level headed husband was taken watching the object. I hesitated making any kind of fuss over this incident until I saw the documentary. I know what we saw cannot be explained away. It was an Unidentified Flying Object.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
Variable orange light in the sky over Simi CA;2009-08-15 23:00:00;30 seconds;Variable orange light in the sky over Simi CA On the night of August 15, 2009 at approximately 11:00PM we saw something strange in the sky.  We were hosting my son's birthday party and were in the backyard enjoying festivities.  There were about 40 people in attendance.   I was standing by the pool when someone called my attention to an odd orange light in the sky that was varying in intensity like a fire.  It was moving towards us at the right speed and altitude to be a small plane and was heading from south to north.  I then noticed my son standing next to me looking at it as well. I thought at first it was a plane on fire.  As I watched I noticed that there were no other lights on this object like an aircraft should have, just a chaotic dimming and brightening orange light.  We did not hear any sound from the object but we did have music playing outside that could have masked any sound.  We watched the object travel across the sky, behind a large pine tree, and back into view.  A few moments later it started dimming and then went out entirely and we could see only dark sky.  The whole event seemed to last about a minute but my better judgment says about 30 to 40 seconds.  There were no clouds in the sky, no unusual weather conditions, just a calm cool summer night.   I checked the news on both the internet and local paper today (the morning after) but have found no reports of anything that would explain what we saw.   A horizontal moving flare?  Ball lightning?  A troubled aircraft?  Others must have seen this which is why I'm reporting it, so that perhaps it can be resolved as to what this was.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
Red fireball floating in sky.;2014-11-01 22:35:00;10 minutes;Red fireball floating in sky. I was sitting on my couch and seen a bright red light out of the corner of my eye.  I turned and looked and it was a red fireball floating in a slow upward diagonal motion.  Called my son and we both went out side on the patio to watch it.  After awhile it flickered on and off about about 4 times moving in a much faster sideways motion and then disapeared.  The whole thing lasted about 10 minutes.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
