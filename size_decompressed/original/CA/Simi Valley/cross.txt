This craft was the same color as the last one I reported to you.  It was the color of the blue part of the flame in your cigarette lighter.  The outside of the flame is orange red, but the inside of the flame is beautiful blue.  Just like this. This craft came closer to my house this time.  I am not sure it was the same type of craft I saw last time since this one had a head and a tail and seemed to be in the shape of a diamond, or cross.  It also had running lights on the outstretched wings and tail. I am reporting this sighting to you because no conventional aircraft could maneuver the skies the way this guy did.  Like my last report, the craft went around the mountain just north east of the Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley, CA. This time the craft was doing some very beautiful and tricky flying.  All of us saw it.  I called my roommate Alex so he saw it too.  It feels good that so many of us saw it in the back yard.  Alex and I were the only adults.  The rest were children ranging from 4 years to 12 years. It occurs to me that my grandsonâ€™s father works for a company that manufactures government drones not too far from this site and this may be a test run of one of their machines.  I only know that this thing moved very fast and circled the area of over 3 miles in seconds doing acrobatics whilst in flight.  It was cool.  I want one!!!!!;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
