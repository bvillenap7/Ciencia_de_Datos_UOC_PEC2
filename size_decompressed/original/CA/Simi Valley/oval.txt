Miraculous angelic orb of incredible speed seen by two witnesses in Simi Valley, March, 1978.;1978-03-07 22:00:00;15 seconds;Miraculous angelic orb of incredible speed seen by two witnesses in Simi Valley, March, 1978. At 22:00 hours on the evening of March 7, 1978 my friend, Steve Glick, and I were returning from a drive-in movie back to my home at ((street deleted)) Ave. in the city of Simi Valley, CA. I was driving a 1966 Dodge Dart and pulled into my driveway, which was due North. As we got out of the car, my friend said with great emphasis what the (bleep) is that. I looked up into a cloudless night sky and at an altitude of about one to two thousand feet above us, at a distance of perhaps five miles, was a transluscent orb of oval shape travelling horizontal to the ground at an extraordinary rate of speed. Within moments the orb then banked downward and then shot straight up into a cloudless night sky and accelerated to a rate beyond the realm of aviation that I was aware of and then blinked once and disappeared. The entire event took less then fifteen seconds. It was clearly not a vessel that either of us had ever seen before and, in fact, did not appear to be a vessel at all but a kind of angelic or celestial plasma. It did not hurt our eyes to look at it and seemed to operate with intelligence and trajectorical intent. The acceleration of the orb was in the realm of the miraculous and caused us both to question what we had seen, or if we had indeed experienced this at all. My friend then said to me We didn't see that and to this day has not spoken of the event at all. I, however, continue to be informed and changed by it to this day.  I would say this UFO experience was more of an Angelic witnessing rather than an aviation event. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245

Daytime sighting of craft over commercial jet in Simi Valley, CA;2008-11-30 13:38:00;one-minute;Daytime sighting of craft over commercial jet in Simi Valley, CA I was looking at a low flying jet when I noticed an oval metallic craft about 5-6 hundred feet bout the jet traveling in the same direction at the same speed. Suddenly, the craft stopped abruptly and started in the opposite direction and accelerated about 8-9 the speed of the jet that it was following at the time I first saw it. It reached a point where it just blinked out and disappeared. This was 45-minutes after the space shuttle crossed over simi valley in its path to Edwards. It was not a bird and it was metallic and reflected the sun.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
