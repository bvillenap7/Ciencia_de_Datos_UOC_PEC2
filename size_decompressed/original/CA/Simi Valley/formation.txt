Delta shaped group of motionless bright red lights sighted over Simi Valley, Calif.;1997-05-22 21:25:00;4 Min.;Summary : Delta shaped group of motionless bright red lights sighted over Simi Valley, Calif. At about 9:25 p.m. on the evening of May 22, 1997 in the Southern California city of Simi Valley (about 25 miles NW of L.A.), while returning home from a Boy Scout meeting, my 12 year old son and I noticed an unusually bright red object in the Northern sky.  We pulled into the parking lot of a local school and exited our vehicle to get a better observation.  What we saw appeared to be not one but a tight group of perhaps 10-15 extremely bright red lights in the shape of a flat triangle or delta at about 330 degrees (looking towards the Big Dipper constellation).  The objects semed perfectly motionless and emitted a constant bright reddish glow.  We observed no blinking of the lights, nor any other lights of another color (such as white aircraft lights).  After approximately 4-5 minutes of observing these objects, they appeared to suddenly dim and then suddenly disappeared from sight as if they lifted vertically at an extremely high rate of speed.  We heard no particular !sounds during this event.   We then returned home and shortly thereafter telephoned NUFORC to report the event as aforesaid.   We have not previously observed such an event as this and are very impressed at whatever our sighting was.   We have since accesses the NUFORC web site and have noticed very similar sightings in North America in the recent past.  We would be pleased to further discuss our sighting with NUFORC.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
