Extremely bright object moving very slowly at a extremely high altitude;2003-01-16 14:00:00;7-10 minutes;Extremely bright object moving very slowly at a extremely high altitude I was on break at work outside and I looked up and noticed a very bright object extremely high in the air.  My initial thought was it was a satellite.  After a few minutes of studying the object I realized it was not a satellite or it would of passed already.  The object did not go in a straight line either.  A gathering appeared and one theory is it was a weather ballon, I am hoping your sight would be able to confirm if a weather ballon was in the area.  The reason I do not think it was a weather ballon is it changed directions.  Due to the height of the object it was to hard to give an exact description.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
