Simi Valley, CA Bright red light high in the sky moved for a while then stopped and it changes color-red to white..;2007-01-03 22:38:00;9 Min;Simi Valley, CA Bright red light high in the sky moved for a while then stopped and it changes color-red to white.. I went out on my porch to have a cigarette. I looked up and at first I thought I saw a plane High in the sky. When I looked closer it was red in color and it was too high up to be a plane (My family is full of pilots, I KNOW AIRCRAFT!)  I called my wife out of the house to look at it. It looked like a red star moving slowly across the sky, Very bright red light.  At first I thought it might be a satelite.  But it kept moving farther away until it stopped right below two stars under neath the Orion Belt.  It gets really bright red and then flickers back to a white color.  It is still there...  Really wierd!!! never seen anything like it... Any ideas what it could be???;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
Strange object spotted over Simi Valley;2009-03-28 21:45:00;3 minutes;Strange object spotted over Simi Valley While outside on a patio looking up near the ursa major constellation saw what appeared to be a really slow moving object re-entering the atmosphere.  It was visible for about 1 or 2 minutes but never really clear what it was.  after about another 2 minutes it was visible again but was a very dim orange or amber colored but not bright, like it was faintly glowing.  It was moving from the east to the west and appeared to be falling to me.  It continued to move towards the horizon and disappeared.  I thought it might have something to do with the space shuttle landing, but heard no boom and the shuttle I later learned had landed in the afternoon, six or more hours before.  Two other friends also witnessed the event.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
Very Bright orange/red light seen overhead in Simi Valley 3-19-10;2010-03-19 20:15:00;4+ minutes;Very Bright orange/red light seen overhead in Simi Valley 3-19-10 Approx 8:15 pm, 3-19-10, Very Bright orange/red light almost directly above not moving for at least 1+ minute getting brighter holding then dimming and almost flashing brightly and dimming with no set frequency.  Faded out to a barley seeable whitish/yellow blob for maybe 10+ seconds then bright again and flashing dimming up and down, still not moving almost directly overhead.  After 1 min or so of this, it started moving slowly toward the east/south east doing the same brightening fading thing as when it was still.  As it was moving it then faded out to the barely seeable whitish/yellow blob for maybe 2 minutes then brightened again as it approached near the horizon.  It then faded out to the barely seeable whitish/yellow blob and appeared to start turning towards the left, then disappeared. The whole thing lasted for maybe 4 minutes or so. I have seen many satellites, meteors, planes and jets and this was nothing like any of those.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
