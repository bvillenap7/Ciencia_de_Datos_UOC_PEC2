Large amber shape spotted in the Northwest sky...;1999-02-19 21:20:00;2 minutes;Large amber shape spotted in the Northwest sky... Myself, along with two other passengers, were travelling westbound on the 23 freeway in Simi Valley. At approximately 9:20 PM, I noticed a strange large amber light in the northwest sky, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. At first I thought it was the moon, but I knew the moon wouldn't be in the southwest sky at 9:20 at night...it's too early. One of us commented seeing the object, and all acknowledged they had been watching it for about a minute. The object was about 1.5x the normal size of the moon in the night sky. The fog had rolled in by then, but about a half-sphere was visible through the fog, as if it was partially masked. The object did not appear to move at all, and within 10 seconds slowly faded into nothing. The object must have been some ways off because even travelling at 70 MPH did not make the object appear to be moving.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245

It hovered, dropped, rose high, and darted to the NE. My wife and I saw a neon green object heading in a southeast direction in Simi Valley, CA toward the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, CA.  It followed the regular flight path of incoming flights.  Although it was very odd shaped and all lit up in a bright neon green color, we assumed it was an explainable aircraft heading to the airport.  The shape looked like a life saver candy but the bottom had a large dimple similar to what a red blood cell looks like.  After it passsed behind some trees, and we assumed it was going to the airport, it returned in the opposite direction and then stopped and hovered.  It dipped straight down very fast and just as fast, it rose again and hovered.  It then took off toward the northeast at a very high rate of speed (NOT toward the airport).   Not sure what we saw, but it did not seem to fit into any explanation we could come up with.;34.2732458278145;-118.75062013245
