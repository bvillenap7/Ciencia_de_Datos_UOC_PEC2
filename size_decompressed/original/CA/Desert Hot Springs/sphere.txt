Metallic/Silver sphere over Desert Hot Springs viewed by 2.;2015-05-10 18:40:00;10-15 seconds;Metallic/Silver sphere over Desert Hot Springs viewed by 2. I was visiting my parents’ house in Desert Hot Springs, CA, for a Mother’s Day dinner on Sunday, May 10, 2015.  At approximately 6:40pm PST, my family I had just finished eating dinner while sitting outside on the patio.  We were noticing some small birds gathering near my parents' bird feeder, when we then saw 4-5 large egrets fly over the house.  This in and of itself is rather odd, as that is not a bird we typical see in our area of the Coachella valley. I turned towards where the egrets were coming from and noticed a silver sphere/orb rise above the roof line of the neighboring house.  I would estimate this object to be within a mile of our location and no more than 1,000 off the ground.  It appeared to be a perfect metallic sphere, with no visible wings, engine, windows, landing gear, etc.  The object was also completely silent and no other visible planes were in the area at that time.  My mother and I saw the object for about 10-15 seconds before it disappeared behind a small gathering of clouds. We were about 10 miles away from Palm Springs International Airport and regularly see planes flying above and near the house.  I am also a member of the Palm Springs Air Museum and consider myself an amateur airplane photographer and have the ability and knowledge to identify many types of aircraft.  This was nothing like I have ever seen.;33.9509016528925;-116.516939256198
