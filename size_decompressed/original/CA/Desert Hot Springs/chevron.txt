Twin  OrangeTriangles flying at extrememly high speed from south to north at high altitude.;2006-03-07 03:45:00;2-3 sec.;Twin  OrangeTriangles flying at extrememly high speed from south to north at high altitude. I saw two Triangle/Chevron shaped objects, which were orange/silver in color, flying together in  formation, one just off the others wing. They were shiny, with no visible lighting. They appeared to be shimmering, either due to their speed, or their altitude.They appeared to be at very high altitude, and streaked across the sky from straight due south to due north. It took them approximately two to three seconds to cover my entire field of vision, which was the whole sky from horizon to horizon. There is no such plane, rocket, or man-made vehicle which could cover this huge distance that fast....I know for a fact, this could not have been a meteor or fireball, this was no atmospheric phenomena, these were definite objects. Besides UFO's the only other explanation would be the space station, but I have seen that before, and these were very different.....plus there were two.;33.9509016528925;-116.516939256198
