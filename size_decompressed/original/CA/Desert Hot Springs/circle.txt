((NUFORC Note:  We suspect lens flares, caused by pointing a camera at a bright object, in this case, the Sun.  PD)) On March 10th, as I was driving into my driveway at home, I noticed a halo around the sun. I'd never seen a halo around the sun before, so I parked my car and walked onto the street to get a picture. I took the first picture and noticed that the shot was not centered. I then adjusted my stance to the left, just a bit, and took another picture.  It was better, but it was still off center, so I walked backwards a few steps, and then stepped to the left just a bit, and took the last shot. After I took the shots, I went into my home and forgot about it.  Last night, going through my pictures, I zoomed in on the halo and noticed a small green circle to the left of the halo. I asked my partner what he thought it was.  He thought it was the moon, at first.   I then looked at the next picture.  It was in that one too, except the green circle was inside the halo.  I looked at the next picture.  Sure enough, there it was again, except this time, it had traveled to the other side of the sun with a purplish triangular glow around it. I took these three shots within seconds of each other.  Whatever it was, it was traveling very fast.  It was completely invisible to my naked eyes but my phone camera captured its movement.;33.9509016528925;-116.516939256198
