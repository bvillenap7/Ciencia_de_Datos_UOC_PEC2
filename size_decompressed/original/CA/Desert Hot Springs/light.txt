Park . A large ball of bright white light was at least 60000 feet in the air. The ball of light was brighter than any object in the sky.  The object had no trail and was traveling in a Southern direction, but seen in the easterly sky. The object was ascending in the atmosphere, and then dimmed as it gained speed and vanished.  Observers were a college graduate (Master's degree) and skilled a construction worker.;33.9509016528925;-116.516939256198
I was very scared and now I'm concerned.;2019-04-10 01:00:00;20 minutes;I was very scared and now I'm concerned. It was between midnight and 1 am, this morning, Thursday, April 11, 2019.  I was in the jacuzzi at a mineral springs spa in Desert Hot Springs, California.  I noticed a very bright light bigger than the stars and it almost seemed to have 2 lights very close or maybe it was  just blurred because it was very bright. My heart started to beat very fast when I thought I saw it had been coming closer.  I wasn't imagining things..  it was coming closer.  It didn't come close enough that I could see any clearer of what this was, hoping it was a drone.  I was petrified and grabbed my robe and ran to my door.  I waited about 20 minutes and went outside and it was back in the original area I first noticed it. I finally fell asleep and waited for the day to end so I could look in that spot and hopefully see the same light.  It would be a star and I could relax.  It was gone.  It's no longer there. I've looked online, but I haven't seen any one else report it.;33.9509016528925;-116.516939256198
