In 58 years, I have never heard such a low heartbeat sound EVER Hi Peter:  At 18:50 (6:50 p.m.) 1/25/04, I was in our home office. The sliding door was opened. It was very quiet inside (no TV, radio or music) and I heard a low, humming pulsating (like a heartbeat) from outdoors, hum, hum, hum like it was alive but like an underground motor. I went outdoors and it stopped.  We overlook Palm Springs, CA about 1500 ft above the valley floor desert hills behind us. It was dark. I went to the east side of house and heard a chopper but did not see that either.  Then north of the house with my husband.  We both saw a solid red light faster than an airplane across the sky from east to west. I called my neighbor and she said she heard it. The vibration shook her refrig/shelves down. In 30 years, she has never heard or felt anything like it. I sensed the helicopter was chasing it.;33.9509016528925;-116.516939256198
