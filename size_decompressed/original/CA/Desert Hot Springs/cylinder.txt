Strange light in northern sky over Coachella Valley.  ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.  PD));2015-12-22 18:08:00;:35;Strange light in northern sky over Coachella Valley. I saw a bright light in the north west sky which I thought was a shooting star, as I continued watching it it failed to dissipate as I expected.   I could make out a shape that was similar to a missile ( approximately 7-10 full size commercial jet liners in length).   Then I saw a blinking light accompanying, or possibly on the object.  The main brilliant light then broke into what appeared to be 4-5 individual brilliant lights and continued flying horizontally until they disappeared over the eastern horizon.
