UFO sighting over Desert Hot Springs with orange fan shaped trail headed East;2011-04-14 21:30:00;30 seconds;UFO sighting over Desert Hot Springs with orange fan shaped trail headed East I was on my back porch and saw a red orange dot looking west and it was traveling east.  At first I thought it was a meteorite but was moving to slow. as it got closer i noticed a orange vapor trail shaped almost like an angel fish.  I called my friend from inside the house to come out and she saw it as well.   the UFO was getting closer it suddenly disappeared along with the orange vapor trail.  It was invisible for about 5 seconds then was visible again for about 5 more seconds then disappeared again.  My best guess for altitude is possibly 30,000 feet and going about four to five times faster than the jets I see come over the mountain to land at the Palm Springs airport.   This is the first time I've seen a UFO.  I can't saw what shape the craft was only that the gas trail was the dominating visual.  I still have an adrenaline rush going after seeing this thing.  I shot video with my iphone but I'm not sure I got it.  If it's on the video, it's so small that you can't make it out. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 21:24 hrs. (Pacific).
