PD));2010-07-11 02:00:00;2 HOURS;nightime ufo sitng cenral valley northern california 7-10-2010 I WAS LOOKING IN THE NIGHT SKY FROM MY HOUSE IN CERES CA.  I WAS LOOKING DUE WEST AND I OBSERVED A STATIONARY OBJECT WITH LIGHT GOING ON AND OF AND CIRLCING THE OBJECT.  IT WAS PRETTY FAR AWAY SO I THOUGHT MAYBE A HELOCOPTER.  I RETRIEVED A PAIR OF BINO'S AND GOT A FIXED, STABLE PLATFORM FOR THE BINONOCULARS AND SET ANBOUT TO REALLY STUDY THIS ANOMALY.  WELL IT DIDNT MOVE AT ALL!   I WATCHED THIS THING FOR A GOOD 30 MIN., THE WHOLE TIME THE LIGHTS KEPT MOVING AND FLASHING ON AND OFF IN WHITE, GREEN OR BLUE AND RED.   AS IT WAS DOING THIS IT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT WAS CHANGING SHAPE WHEN IT GOT TO THE WHITE LIGHT.  IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS CONSOLIDATING.   YESTERDAY I LOOKED ON THE INTERNET TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER SITINGS LIKE MINE AND I FOUND RIGHT AWAY AN EXACT MATCH!.
