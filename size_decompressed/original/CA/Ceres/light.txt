We stopped at the end of his court when we all the sudden saw this white bright object go across the sky in front of us, it picked up speed and turned green as it started going fast and downhill.  It later disappeared and the light poles from where the object passed through started flickering on and off.   I later was dropped off and my sister told me that before I got there, my dog kept going all crazy and barking up at the sky.;37.5855;-120.9453
