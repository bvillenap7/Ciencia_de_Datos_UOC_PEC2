Fireballs seen from Ceres, California;2010-01-12 22:45:00;30 seconds;Fireballs seen from Ceres, California We were driving West on Whitmore Ave. in Ceres, California.  I don't remember which night it was, but it was near the 12th of January.  We were just starting our incline as we were starting to cross the overpass and we saw a three flashes of light.  Each flash of light looked like a small orange fireball and they appeared and disappeared in three distinct spots.  It was almost as if someone had lit something on fire and put it out really quickly and it was too high in the sky to be a firework.   My partner who was driving asked if I had seen what he just did.  I confirmed with him that I did.  We entered the freeway and our view was blocked by trees.  We saw a few more flashes behind the trees and after the trees cleared, we saw one more of the objects flash and disappear.   I watched for more on the rest of the drive home and I did not see anything after that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.5855;-120.9453
Floating fireball dripping what seemed like molten metal.;2012-01-18 21:04:00;3 min;Floating fireball dripping what seemed like molten metal. Floating fireball, orange and red, dripping straight down molten like red material every 30 seconds or so. Didn't seem large, maybe size of a car dripping approximately basketball sized drops.  The drops seemed to leave a long straight line behind them, like a trail or tether.  Shrank after dropping two in a row and dissapeared without moving.  Would like to add that it was close to highway and I pulled over so hopefully someone else spotted it, because I left my vehicle and may have drawn attention.;37.5855;-120.9453
