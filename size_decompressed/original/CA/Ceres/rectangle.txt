Illuminated upside down bread pan like  moving, silent object.;2002-02-19 02:00:00;10 seconds;Illuminated upside down bread pan like  moving, silent object. 500' overcast, lite dizzle, no noise , looked like an upside down bread baking pan with bright tiny lights, randomly located over the top 2/3rds of the vessle- white light very much look like the  tiny decorative lights hung out at Christmas.  I was in the car when it appeared through windshield, partner standing out side the passenger door, answered it is!, when I said, look! a UFO!  I had quicly wet my finger and touched window as to length and width and height. being a commercial pilot, I checked the overcast height later and by perspective from finger marks drew out approximate size : length of about 3 RR box cars width of 4 and height of 2. taper from bottom to top was about 10 - 15 degrees. I estimated the velocity to between 150 to 200 MPH.  The craft was 'scud-running' as we pilot say. Being in the 'scud' any view of the surface color was diminished other than to say 'cast iron'like /dark/ dull -finish  The lights did not reflect from the vessile's sid! e or tail end.  For such a fair size,as it headed north north-west,  the total silence was unique especially with the wet atmosphere which carried any sound in an enhanced manner ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
