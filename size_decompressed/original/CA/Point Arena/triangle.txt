2 very different incidences a week apart, triangler (tonight), and very bright far away organish glow.(10/9/2013);2013-10-14 20:30:00;15 minutes;2 very different innocidences a week apart, triangler (tonight), and very bright far away organish glow.(10/9/2013) 		Hello,	 Thank you first of all for everything you guys do. 	About a hour and a half ago we saw a triangler craft, gliding, floating (not really going anywhere) first it was orangey red, and had a dim flashing light (which to me indicated man made) although as it was going past the next ridge (approximantely 2 miles) it didnt have the orangish glow, it was more blueish, and very faint and not really all too noticable.  The craft seemed small, almost super advice fighter like, although it had the typical 3 angle lights, and was a triangle and was definitely in Zero gravity, and gliding very slow, the person who first saw it, said it was going up and down in a floating ( almost on sea ) look. although i myself didnt witness that. 	This is the second  ufo seen in our local sky in a week, about 5 days ago 10/9/2013 me and another person saw a Very bright organgish glow. it was amazing, it was low and threw the trees, and it seems miles away although there was no way to tell how far it really was... didnt see a craft or anything like that, but it was easily bigger then full moon and had the same type of brightness (even threw the tree), as a perspective of how low it was, the trees were about 100-150 feet away, and were only at tops 20-30 feet tall. so it was very low. 	I live in a very rural area, although were more isolated we very open minded out here, if any other people in town talk about the light or ufo sighting ill try to get them to report it here seperately, because I know how multiple reports matter, and i understand in a rural area like this its very hard to fact check.;38.9152;-123.6
