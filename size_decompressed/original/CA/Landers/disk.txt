My child caught a picture of a craft.;2003-12-31 14:30:00;Unknown;My child caught a picture of a craft. My child took a digital camera into the hills to take pictures of animal life and caught an object on the corner of the camera. Top and bottom are of saucer shape, in the middle is a bright light. There were two of them and my child thought that it was a couple of birds circling each other. The cloud formation was folowing the object that was captured on camera. The clouds, at first, were in a circular motion and dropped into the clouds which then came up through the clouds and headed right behind the object. My child also told me that there was a strange sound coming from the object like a car screaching to a stop, but slightly different. My other child said that the sound was like a high pitch whistle. I will try and send a copy of the photo, but do not really know computers. Hope it makes it.;34.3103;-116.5241
