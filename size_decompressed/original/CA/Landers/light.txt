Amber UFO Chased by Military Helicopter(s) at Giant Rock 5/21/17 CITD.;2017-05-21 22:30:00;2 minutes;Amber UFO Chased by Military Helicopter(s) at Giant Rock 5/21/17 CITD Shortly after doing a high-vibration meditation, while holding hands in a circle with about 50 others at Giant Rock, CA, an amber craft appeared to the northeast.  My wife saw it through night vision goggles, while I had just missed seeing it as I raced over to the others as it disappeared to the northwest behind Spy Mountain.  Within minutes, loud roaring of what sounded like jet engines and a military helicopter came from the east/northeast followed by another a minutes or so later.  These then came around the south side of Spy Mountain, heading south, and clearly could see an elongated amber light being followed by a military helicopter with flashing lights.  The amber light was not flashing and had no other lights visible.   The amber light sped off to the south and the helicopter could not keep up.  This was interesting how we invited them to appear with the meditation, and the first thing that happens is our military chases them. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports about the same event.
