(LA metropolitan area).  At first I just thought, wow it is a beautiful cluster of stars in a very bright moon night (almost full moon).   Took my eyes off the sky and walk to get my son from a music lesson, but in just 3 or 4 steps, I stop and want to take a look at this group of bright stars again with some puzzles and scan through the sky for some reference to other stars but the moon is too bright to see other stars.  Now my eyes are back with all these bright stars and studied them a little bit with fascination even with some thin clouds passed by I can still saw through it, they are that bright.   Now with the cloudâ€™s motion, I felt like I wanted to look at the moon to my left to see which way the clouds were moving.  It looked like the clouds moved West-East direction.  Now I was back at these stars, I started to realize they were slightly moving south-east (farer away from me).  Now I heard my son and his teacher at the front door to my left, so I walked there and had a few quick conversations with the teacher and got back to my son and pulled him out to see those stars, but by now they are even further south and just above the electric light pole.   I tried to relocate our position, but it was too late and they were gone.  I felt bad because my son missed it, and I really want him to see it.   I did try to send a drawing picture with this report, too. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite seriou-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));34.0232248945146;-117.851325738397
