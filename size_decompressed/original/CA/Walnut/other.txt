object flying right above a sedan vehicle;2009-07-12 03:00:00;3-4 sec;object flying right above a sedan vehicle About 3-4 AM in the morning on my way back home from a family party with a couple of my friends (2)  dropped  off one of them and on the freeway coming back on the 60 east going towards brea canyon from pathfinder in  diamond bar before we hit the ramp a figure as big as the car shaped like sting ray without the tail color all gray  looked kinda like sheet mettle just maneuvered a couple feet right above us going the opposite direction.  Conspiracy? I think so, whatever it may be it looked as though it was not man made, we were in shock.;34.0232248945146;-117.851325738397
