I always carried binoculars in the car, and when I got out of car, I saw what I thought was hang glider coming over the Topa Topa Mountains.  It was swaying back and forth slow speed.  That is why I thought it was a hang glider.  I noticed that it was much too high for a hang glider.  It was silver metalic in color.   I grabbed my binoculars and I was standing near power lines because I could hear them crackle.  The ship was delta shaped through the binoculars and continued to slowly glide back and forth..way too slow stay aloft I thought.  I would guess altitude to be 10 to 15 thousand feet by judging how high it was in relation to the mountains which were about 4 to 5 thousand feet (I hiked those mountains all the time).   This is where it gets really odd...it continued slowly gliding towards the Pacific Ocean.  Then, in the blink of the eye, through the  inoculars it disappeared!  Could not see it at all..no noise..no contrail..just gone!  Just incredible.    Thanks ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.
