I was listening to music in bed while staring at the night sky through my window when a Diamond shape aircraft flew right over my home, it was quite low, to the point where the lights on the craft weren't a blur I could see them clearly and detailed.   There where 4 lights in each corner, they were pretty huge lights, they were a cool yellow.  Sine the aircraft flew right above me i was able to see underneath, the bottom was a metal grey.  I would say it most likely resembles a TR-3B but I recall it being a diamond shape and no center light.   It did make noise that could easily be heard almost like a blow-dryer on a really really low setting. It flew real low and real slow.   I was able to get out of bed go outside stare at it a bit, come back inside to get my mother, and return outside to continue watching it before it disappeared behind the mountain that is a mile and a half away from our house.   Although it disappeared we can still hear it clearly for the 5 minutes.;34.3555999999999;-119.070100000001
