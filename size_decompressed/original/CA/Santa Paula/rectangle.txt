Hovering craft over the house.;1976-06-01 19:00:00;60 seconds;Hovering craft over the house I looked up to see a huge-roof-size rectangler craft-looking ship hoovering above like right above the house.  It was very florescent green and very distinct in it's shape like a craft from Star Wars or Battlestar Gallectica.  It was there and was REAL silent..an uncanny silence...  it didnt move...just was there..then disappeared. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.
