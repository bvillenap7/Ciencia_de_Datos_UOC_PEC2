I was speaking on the phone with my boyfriend when I looked up at the clear blue sky and saw a silver bullet shaped object with no wings or any other identifiable features. I then noticed a slightly smaller silver bullet that appeared to be â€œtowed by the first object. I commented to my boyfriend that it looked strange and I could not identify what I saw. I then saw a third silver bullet-looking object that was slightly smaller in size flying in perfect formation with the first two silver bullets. It eventually became apparent that I was looking at 3 silver bullet shaped objects, one smaller than the other in consecutive order, flying in perfect formation. I wanted badly to photograph the objects but I was driving at the time and had my eyes peeled on both the road and the sky. When I told my boyfriend everything I saw, I looked back up again from the road an! d the three objects had vanished in the sky. There was absolutely no clouds in the sky that day and the sky was crystal blue and clear. The objects seemed like they were flying a few thousand feet in the air and they were not flying fast at all. As soon as the objects vanished, I was undeniably dumbfounded and commented to my boyfriend how I could not believe what I just saw because one minute they were there flying at a moderate rate and the next they had completely vanished as though they had not even existed. There were other aircraft in the sky but not close enough to the vicinity of the objects I saw. There were 2 other aircraft I remember seeing flying in the sky. The neighborhood consists of crops and fields with a slither of the Santa Paula mountains and Santa Clara river nearby.;34.3555999999999;-119.070100000001
