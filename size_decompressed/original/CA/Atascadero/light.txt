PD));2007-03-07 19:00:00;1 hour;Bright Ligtht sighted over Morro Bay and Atascadero California for about an hour on 3/7/7 I observed a bright light hovering over the hills between Morro Bay and Atascadero.  I looked at it through binoculars and it seemed to change brightness levels going from very bright and colorful to very dim and white.  Every once in a while it would move back and forth up and down very quicly but not very far.  I would say it moved about 2-4 inches in the sky each time it moved.  I left for about ten minutes at about 7:50 and when I returned the object was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius or Venus??  PD));35.43096751269;-120.761970304568

Was sitting in my Jaquzzi when I saw a bright object heading South South East.  The object was probably 5 miles away or less at 10k altitude.  The object paused and changed to a lesser brightness and appeared to gain altitude and disappeared.;35.43096751269;-120.761970304568
