It is white, wing-less (from what I could tell) and cigar/oval/cylindrical shape with no contrail and no noise.  There is always alot of military aircraft flying here since we are close to Vandenberg AFB.  The second sighting it flew at the same time as two military aircraft at a higher elevation, flying past each other, one multi-engine jet, the other smaller, single or twin-engine, both high altitude.  My first thought was that the white object was a drone, pilotless sort but have not seen anything like it in the archives.  I thought it might be a blimp, but the second viewing it was traveling at an accelerated speed.  I can't think why a Black operation, or X-plane or whatever would fly so conspicously in the day light.;35.43096751269;-120.761970304568
Spotted a green, glowing, cylinder shaped craft, while driving home at 10:30pm.;2007-07-24 22:34:00;less than one minute;Spotted a green, glowing, cylinder shaped craft, while driving home at 10:30pm. Driving home from a friend's house at around 10:30pm. Area was a narrow road with dense brush and many residential areas. While watching the road for deer, I noticed a strange greenish blue glow in the top left corner of my windshield. A craft cylindrical in shape, flew over head, it was extremely high up, and flew at an incredible speed. Sensing something was extremely odd about this, I pulled off the road and stuck my head out my driver's window. The craft slowed almost to a standstill, it gave off light trials similar to waving a bright light quickly in a pitch black room. Suddenly the craft became bright white, causing the sky to momentarily glow, and then it disappeared. I drove the rest of the way home with my window rolled down and going about two miles per hour, but I didn't see it again.;35.43096751269;-120.761970304568
