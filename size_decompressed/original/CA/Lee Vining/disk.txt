large saucer;1979-08-14 01:30:00;2.min;large saucer This has haunted me for 22 years. My girl friend and I where traveling to to go gamble at Lake tahoe, we where 4-5 miles past Mono Lake on 395, when I looked to the rigth of the road there was an object hovering it was much larger than a 747, it was a clear night, and you could make out a sphere shape with blue and orange lights Bebbie put her glasses on and freaked a little. We where terrified, we watched the object for 30 seconds, then it was gone but we had traveled 15 miles and where on the top of the pass, we where both very confused. Three months later my girl friend got extremely ill unknown virus  she was treated for incepholitius, but the bone marrow showed an unknown virus.  She now has extreme vertigo. We both have no explanation for the missing time. We where going to report in to the air force but thought it was better not to. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));37.989;-119.1234
