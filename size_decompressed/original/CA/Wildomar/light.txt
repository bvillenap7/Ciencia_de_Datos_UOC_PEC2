Orange ball streaks across skyline;2011-11-20 22:00:00;3-4 seconds;Orange ball streaks across skyline November 2011    This seems to be a hot spot because most of our neighbors have reported seeing objects in the sky that they believe to be UFOâ€™s. This particular instance there was a group of us sitting out side in my backyard at approximately 10-11pm.  A friend and I were sitting where we could see the skyline which faces west. From the northwest skyline an orange / amber colored object streaked by horizontally going incredibly fast.  It made no noise and appeared to be just above the rooftop of the house behind us.  It went from northwest to southwest in a flash and disappeared. Both of us witnessed this simultaneously and even got up to investigate.  But the object just vanished. Others saw it, but not the full event of it streaking across the skyline. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.6056;-117.2662
