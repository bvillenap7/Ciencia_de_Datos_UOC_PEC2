Bright light accross Wildomar  skyline west.;2012-04-10 12:16:00;4-5 Seconds;Bright light accross Wildomar  skyline west. A friend of mine called around 12am stating he'd seen a bright orange light in the sky. I stepped out side my house (facing west) in the same direction he stated he'd seen the light. The light was no longer visible by his home (Temecula CA) Hoping I'd catch a glimpse of something I chatted on the phone with him for roughly 10-15 minutes. While chatting I immediately noticed a very pale white/orange circle skimming across the mountains that run west along Murrieta/Temecula/Wildomar . It was brief but the UFO was flying upwards of 400mph. I'm not a pilot but I've flown in Cessna's quite a few times. I've been around aircraft and this was NOT a regular aircraft. It was much to large and VERY fast.  I wished I had more information but thought it important to report.;33.6056;-117.2662
