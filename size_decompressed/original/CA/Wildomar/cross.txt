Silent fixed wing craft without lights.;2004-10-05 22:00:00;20 seconds;Silent fixed wing craft without lights. I caught site of the object while in an outdoor jacuzzi. It was flying low but too high to be a bird. It was slightly lighter in color than the night sky without the moon being present. It appeared to be a fixed wing aircraft but was completely silent and was traveling at a rate of speed faster than a normal plane. The object had no lights and quickly vanished. I live approximately 25 miles from a military airport.;33.6056;-117.2662
