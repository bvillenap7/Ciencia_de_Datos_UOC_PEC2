Triangle with flashing lights in Placerville;2007-09-17 05:45:00;2 minutes;Triangle with flashing lights in Placerville It was about 5:45am and I was driving west on Hwy.50. from Pollock Pines to Placerville.  As I was leaving to town of Camino I saw a flashing light in the sky. At first I thought it was a plane because there is an airport close by. As I got closer I could see it was triangle shape with flashing white and red lights that would turn green. As I drove into Placerville it went behind a hill.  Then I saw it on the south side of the Hwy. while I was in the middle of Placerville. Both times I saw it, it did not move.  I am 51 years old and retired. I drive someone to work in Placerville most mornings.;38.7253;-120.7966
