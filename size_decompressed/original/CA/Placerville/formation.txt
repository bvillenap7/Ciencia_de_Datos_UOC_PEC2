Triangle formation of lights.  Looked like moving stars.;2003-08-03 20:57:00;2 -3  mins;Triangle formation of lights.  Looked like moving stars. We looked up and say three lights in a triangle formation.  They did not seem like they were all one craft.  They moved slowly across the sky and looked jittery.  What I mean by that, was when compared to a plane or something else, the planes moved smoothly...not jerky. Anyway, we followed them for a couple of minutes, they were straight above us, the the lead one sort of disappeared, the the next one, then the last one.  They were the same size as the stars.  It just looked like 3 stars moving together.  Same light and everything.  Anybody know what it was? ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness observed the three satellites, which fly in formation, and which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy NOSS surveillance system.  PD));38.7253;-120.7966
