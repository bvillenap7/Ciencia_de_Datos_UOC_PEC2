8 objects flying in a figure 8 pattern..at a very high altitude..;2004-10-06 15:00:00;5 min.;8 objects flying in a figure 8 pattern..at a very high altitude.. As I took a break from my motorcycle ride, my eyes went skyward and I noticed what I thought were birds at a very high altitude most people would have not been able to see them (I have excellent vision). I kept watching the (birds) because they were acting so peculiar. They were circling around and around and interweaveing in a strange kind of pattern (like a figure 8) I thought, how odd to use up all that energy for no apparent reason...Then it occured to me that they might not be birds at all..That's when I noticed one (bird) sat still in the sky while the others kept flying in a pattern.....no way a bird could or would do that....I had to look away for a few seconds to rest my eyes (as much as I wanted to keep watching in amazement) I just could'nt, my eyes were getting tired...When I looked back to the location...They were gone!...Not one object left to be seen..I looked and kept looking and nothing...at all...If it was a flock of birds I would have seen them trailing off..There wasn't a cloud in the sky...I wondered what they could have been circling above...I know it was for a reason..But what?

I saw 5 saucers above Placerville CA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of twinkling stars??  PD));2004-10-06 23:00:00;1 hour;I saw 5 saucers above Placerville CA. They were turning around and around and the white light came out of it all the way around it.  Lines of white light came out of it.  Every now and then youd see a red light come out of it.  But would dissappear but the white light stayed.   And that's when I saw the other 4 of the saucers. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Given the long duration of the sighting, we wonder whether the witness might have been looking at a twinkling star.  PD));38.7253;-120.7966
Orange craft hovering close to the house;2008-05-25 03:00:00;unk;Orange craft hovering close to the house   My girlfriend came to me with this and told me that 2 weeks or more had passed. She told me that between 2am and 3am she looked out the window and say a UFO hovering at the tree line and between the trees. This was bright orange in the center and less light out from the center. She told me that she was half asleep and that she felt like she was dreaming but was awake. She also said that this made noise but can not put it in words. (warping noise is the only word I can come up with) This location is the foothills of placerville 2,900 feet elevation.  I think she was dreaming and that this did not happen. I am only reporting it so that maybe, and only if there is several other reports the same day and area then I will believe her. Sorry for the grammar, really tired it's late!;38.7253;-120.7966
