Comet-like sighting in Northern California.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 18:30:00;10 minutes;Comet-like sighting in Northern California My wife and I witnessed this while driving south early evening 11/7/15. We actually pulled over on the side of the road, on top of a hill, on Lotus Road,  just south of Lotus, CA to witness the unusual sighting.  Because of its linear path I predicted that it was a missile of some sort or a comet. What was fascinating was the exhaust plumage funneling from behind the craft.  The enormous exhaust plumage remained for a while - it looked like a giant mushroom, or a giant bell with complete with clapper.  The object was moving from east to west. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S.
