unusual light seen traveling in a northwesterly direction near Placerville, CA;2000-08-08 03:40:00;15-30 seconds;unusual light seen traveling in a northwesterly direction near Placerville, CA I was out having a break during work. I usually sit and watch the stars when I saw an unusual white light.There were no other lights on the object and I could not tell the shape. It was about as bright as a star. I was facing the west and the light was about at 30 deg from the horizon and about 30 deg to the north of the constellation Taurus. I cannot tell how far away it was, but from my best guestimate it would have been some where between Placerville and Lake Tahoe, moving in a north-westerly direction. The speed wasnt as fast as a satellite would be but it wasnt as slow as a plane. I saw the light for about 15-30 seconds then it slowly faded out. I kept watching it thinking it was a plane but there was no sign of any strobes, which if it had been a plane I would have been able to see. I can definately say it wasn't an airplane.;38.7253;-120.7966
Bright orange object moving in a east/northeasterly direction;2000-08-20 23:05:00;5 min;Bright orange object moving in a east/northeasterly direction I was out taking a break when I noticed to the north west a bright orange glowing object moving in an easterly/north easterly direction. The object was shimmering, similar to a star, only bright orange. While I was watching the object dimmed and brightened several times. It seemed to be moving very slowly. The object stayed about 5-10 degrees above the horizon as it moved. It moved about 10-15 degrees in the 5 minutes I watched it. I lost sight of the object after the 5 minutes.;38.7253;-120.7966
