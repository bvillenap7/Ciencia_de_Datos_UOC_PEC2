Flying craft, morphed shapes, disappeared, and flew at very high speeds.;2017-08-13 19:00:00;10 minutes;Flying craft, morphed shapes, disappeared, and flew at very high speeds. UFO had running lights on, very similar to what you would see on a police helicopter.  It was stationary, but very still.  I noticed it and remarked on why is a helicopter sitting like that, right there?  Then it moved, morphed shape several times, changed color of lights, disappeared all together several times, and flew at very high rate of speeds, at very low altitudes, and even though it appeared to be very close to us, it had no sound.  Shortly after it left the area, several military type aircraft circled around where it had been.  And up very high in the night sky, what looked like moving stars (not meteors) much like a commercial airliner up high in the sky, but it looked like a tiny star moving in different directions, towards where the initial UFO had gone out of sight.;38.7253;-120.7966
