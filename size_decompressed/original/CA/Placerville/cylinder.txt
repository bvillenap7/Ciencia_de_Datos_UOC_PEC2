White cylinder seen in Placerville, CA disappeared quickly;2008-12-10 10:30:00;3 minutes;White cylinder seen in Placerville, CA disappeared quickly On Thursday December 10 2008 at around 10:30 in the morning I was outside having a last cigarette before my History Class final and I noticed a Passenger Jet at cruising altitude (I would guess at 30,000 feet) and at a much lower altitude a white cylinder shaped object.  At the time I thought it was a small Cessna or a small plane of that type.  I did notice a lack of wings, but at the time I thought the plane was tilted to that the wings were hidden by the body.  The object was high enough that I couldn’t see any details, except that it was brilliantly white and had 2 dark bands (no idea of the color).  I didn't hear any sound at all. Well a cute young lady drew my attention away for 5-20 seconds approx. and when I looked back the passenger jet was still there, but the object had completely disappeared.  I looked around the sky, but it was nowhere to be seen.  The speed of the object wasn’t great enough to have disappeared that fast.;38.7253;-120.7966
