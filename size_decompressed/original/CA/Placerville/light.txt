Light  5-10 seconds view from patio clear sky  Light outruns 2 jets!! Single light swerving back & forth with forward momentem.Followed by 2 military jets that sounded like they were near full throttle. Very Loud As the jets followed the light across the horizen 2-3 seconds the light silently went up and away from the jets at an uncalculable speed. As though the jets were moving 1 m.p.h. and the light  100 m.p.h. . I know these are not near actual speeds,that is just my way of describeing the situation.

Unverified pair of bold star lights diminishing in perfect unison.;2003-10-11 19:05:00;Ten minutes;Unverified pair of bold star lights diminishing in perfect unison. Upon driving from Apple Hill Farms located 10 miles east of Placerville CA heading west to Sacramento CA, I decided to exit highway 50 into Eldorado County which is approximately 30 miles or more east of Sacramento.  I had anticipated the Moon rising around that time of the evening as it was almost a perfectly dark sky with vivid stars in appearance.  The planet Mars was already up in the east-south-east direction maybe 40+ degrees [10 oclock high] above the horizon.  I made an exit from the freeway and took a main road traveling back east and found an open hill area that I could set up my camera and take some time lapse photo's of the full Moon rising.  While waiting patently for this to transform [30 minutes]the planet Mars had two neighbors that I thought to be stars in the distance to the left of it, which was nothing unusual, just as bright as your brightest star in the sky but bold.  I kept notice of the two neighbors of Mars because they were easy to behold and I didn't recognize any star pattern that they belonged to, which I'm not a serious avid star gazer.  As I was shooting the Moon rising photo's I looked serveral times at the lights [or stars] next to Mars [approx a minute at a time] and the final time I looked the two star lights begin to diminish in perfect sequence, exact correlating unison and vanished.  The receding of their light took about seven seconds to dimenish altogether in unison from their star like brightness to nothing. They never moved, completely stationary all the time, and that's why I thought they were bold bright stars setting in the sky.  I continued to check the sky to see if maybe a patch of high clouds were obscuring their visibility, and I looked for possible high fog patches passing through the sky as well, but I didn't see any of these effects. Neither of the other sky objects were affected, all the stars and the planet Mars which were within close radius of the two star lights were never affected and their brightness never diminished at all.  Th! e sky was basically clear during that time of the evening except for a few stray patches of clouds/fog sitting on the horizon when the moon begin to rise.  Although it has been over a week since I viewed this amazing specticle of objects in unison I continue to check the sky each night to make sure that the star lights I saw were not stars hidden by a sweep of the milky way and to my amazement I have yet to see those star lights or objects again, neither can I correlate any of the stars or planets in the sky to the placement of where the objects were. I'm still looking each night but I have found no resemblance of distance or pattern of objects to relate.  The Moon was rising far to the left of the planet Mars which was already up in the sky, and Mars temporary neighbors were about two tenths of the distance from Mars judging from the the total distance between the Moon and Mars.  If anyone has an explanation I would appreciate being informed. I considered maybe a satelite or orbiting objects from earth, but the star lights I witnessed were stationary through out the duration [over 30 minutes].;38.7253;-120.7966
A slow moving light moving over Placerville;2004-07-07 23:05:00;5min;A slow moving light moving over Placerville I was driving home from work along with two others headed in the same direction. Eastbound from Cameron Park. When I noticed a very bright light above, in front of me. It slowly moved eastward until it appeared to go behind the horizon. There were no blinking lights and it did not follow the normal flight paths that I see every night at that point. At work the next day the other two informed me that they had saw it also.;38.7253;-120.7966
On November 15, 2004, in Placerville, California, My daughter and I had both gone to bed. Right when I was just about to fall asleep I;2004-11-15 21:30:00;5 seconds;On November 15, 2004, in Placerville, California, My daughter and I had both gone to bed. Right when I was just about to fall asleep I heard a large noise that was accompanied by a great hum. It felt as if everything around me was humming also, even our home. This hum was even inside of me like a great vibration.  I heard my 13-year-old daughter scream and I ran into her room. Her light was off and she was sitting up in bed with the blinds open and said that something flew by her window with a long white light following it that caused the whole sky in front of her to turn white. It then flew up into the sky and disappeared. She said, it made everything in the sky white.  I looked outside and only got to see the stars and nothing else.  I then asked her a few more questions and from that, she said that she felt a hum in her body and sat up, which is when she saw the big thing fly by and the white light.  Our neighbors felt the hummmmm but didn't see the lights because their apartment sits in front of the building and not in the back like ours.  Placerville, California ia 42 miles east of Sacramento and 50 miles west of Tahoe on Highway 50.;38.7253;-120.7966

1-2 sized orange light orb flew out of my throat and mouth.;2007-07-01 05:30:00;30 seconds;1-2&quot sized orange light orb flew out of my throat and mouth. 3 years ago, I woke up at 5:30 am, stretched with arms over my head as I lay on bed. I felt a &quotpuff&quot of air like a soft air marshmallow sized puff that popped right out of my throat and mouth! It was an orange, marshmallow sized light ball  I chased it over the bed and before I could touch it, It flew around my bedroom and darted behind our dresser.  I did not look behind the dresser. I never saw it before and never saw it again. I'm a highly respected wildlife artist with feet firmly on the ground.;38.7253;-120.7966
