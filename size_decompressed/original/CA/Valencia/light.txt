Two dull lights moving in tandom across the sky. The trailing light moved closer to the leading one at one point.;2001-03-26 20:10:00;1 minute;Two dull lights moving in tandom across the sky. The trailing light moved closer to the leading one at one point. There were two lights flying in unison that were star like but duller than a star. They seemed to be at a very high altitude. They were traveling in a northwest to southeast direction. I thought it was one object with two lights until the trailing one moved closer as if catching up to the other. There was no sound associated with them. They crossed the sky in less than one minute. They were not aircraft as they had no strobe lights or colored lights. I first thought that perhaps it was a satillite until the trailing one moved closer to the leading one. I have always beleived that there are too many sightings for UFO's not to exist. I have never seen anything like this before. Usually I can explain what I saw. Usually it turns out to be an aircraft or what I would assume is a satillite. This time however when the second one moved closer to the first and the dullness of the light I cannot explain what I saw other than it was a UFO.;34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065
Very low, loud oscillating sound, 3 streaks of thin green light;2004-03-05 04:30:00;30 seconds;Very low, loud oscillating sound, 3 streaks of thin green light At approximately 4:30am, I woke up to an incredibly obscene, low oscillating sound.  It started as a hum, and grew louder and more pronounced.  It was similar to a helicopter whump except that it was enormous, much louder and with more resonance.  I am very familiar with helicopter, jet and prop aircraft sound.  I never get out of bed for the usual aircraft noises, but this was so strange that I shot out of bed and looked out the window by instinct.  At that point, the low, humming grew louder and almost with a bang, I saw at least 3 thin streaks of green light, close together at low altitude travel from south to north very quickly.  I am not sure if this was 1 aircraft or multiple, as I was unable to pick out a shape.  The noise faded out quicker than it appeared.  Total experience time was approximately 30 seconds.  My initial thought was that it was one gigantic helicopter that I have never heard before.  My second thought was that it was a group of smaller helicopters very close together.  After thinking about it further, the sound made me change my mind and refer to it as experimental aircraft because the sound was incredibly unique, the direction of travel was inconsistant with the usual aircraft overhead, altitude was very low and speed was very high compared to usual aircraft overhead.  I just can't get over the sound, which was so unusual, I decided to write this report.;34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065
A bright Orb with opaque trails at sunrise.;2009-11-05 05:00:00;5 minutes;A bright Orb with opaque trails at sunrise The time was between 5 and 6 am, myself and two friends of mine were watching the sun rise the morning of November 4th 2009 looking east into the morning fog of Valencia California, from the vantage point of the southeast corner of The California Institute of The arts’ small hilly campus. The light was nearing daytime brightness as one of my friends spotted a bright light in the northeast sky falling downward towards the earth at what seemed like tremendous velocity. My first thought was that a massive commit was about to impact the earth, mostly because of the massive wispy trail it left in it’s wake. Then as it neared the earth’s surface it turned upward, this is when we noticed that there were multiple trails that that flowed from the rear of the craft. I no longer believe it was a commit we saw. Another peculiar feature of the trails were that, they did not seem to linger in the sky like any conventional aircraft, but seemed like semi-transparent kite tr! ails swaying non-uniformly  behind whatever we were seeing. As the light floated effortlessly upward it became harder and harder to see through the fog. By the time the sun rose over the hills the light had virtually disappeared. This entire event took place over the span of about 5 minutes.;34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065
My mom called me out onto our patio and was like hey is that one of the satellites going across the sky?  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-03 20:30:00;3 minutes;My mom called me out onto our patio and was like &quothey is that one of the satellites going across the sky?&quot  I replied &quoty My mom called me out onto our patio and was like hey is that one of the satellites going across the sky?  I replied yes you finally got to see it!  Within a moment later while I was still looking up at the sky I noticed another small small dot of light. Going in the exact same direction and a good distance from the first object.  I was like wait a second, I've never seen two back to back.  All of a sudden my mom was like theres another one!  Sure enough we kept counting and counting. Ending with 7 objects. The exact same distance apart. Going in the same direction. It was amazing to witness!  They were the smallest balls of light, not really noticable to those that weren't stargazing.;34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065
