Eight objects flying in a modified V formation seven smaller objects all with one red light, white light on larger object;2002-07-23 22:10:00;1:30 (min/sec);Eight objects flying in a modified V formation seven smaller objects all with one red light, white light on larger object While I was talking to a friend outside one night I noticed in the northern sky behind her, eight approaching aircraft which I estimate their altitude to be 15, 000 ft. to 20,000 ft. These may have been seven spotter or escort planes accompanying a much larger craft in a modified, yet very structured V formation.  The five smaller objects, with one red light each, fanned out evenly spaced to the side and behind the larger craft left wing. The larger craft appeared to have only white light(s).  On the right side of the larger craft were only two other objects (also with one red light each) replicated the same pattern and spacial distance as noticed on the other side of the craft.  The five objects on the larger craft's leftside (as well as the other two on the right side), each had one bright red light which flashed once (for approximately one second -- much like an airport runway strobe but slower)) in a sequential fashion from the lead object back to the last and then repeated this same sequence as it continued across the night's sky. It began in the northen sky and seemed to cruise at what would be a normal commercial aircraft speed for that altitude taking appoximately 1min/30sec to cross from the norhern most horizon to the southern most horizon. The sound was a gentle whisper and appeared to defy what might have seemed a normal audible sound for so many aircraft. My friend began watching almost immediately after I spoted this unusual formation.  She did not distinguish 8 separate objects, but felt that it was one composite.  My engineering background and practical mind convinces me it must be eight craft in total, although I could not see eight separate craft.  Is there some practical explanation or answer for this type of formation? ((NUFORC Note:  Time was corrected by witness to 22:10 hrs. we have amended the time here.  We spoke at length with the witness, and found her to be exceptionally credible.  She is quite familiar with all types of aircraft, and she stated that what she had observed was no type of a/c with which she is familiar.  PD));34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065

Lights hovering over the 5 Freeway;2010-12-17 01:45:00;3-5 min;Lights hovering over the 5 Freeway I had just gotten on the southbound 5 Freeway between Route 126 and Magic Mountain Parkway.  While driving, I saw two steady white lights in the sky south of my location.  They were up about as high as a traffic helicopter might be.  As I approached between Magic Mountain Parkway and Valencia Boulevard, I realized that whatever was up there wasn't moving.  It was just hanging there in the sky.  There were no strobes, there were no other colors. Just two, maybe three white lights.  Once I got to Valencia Boulevard, and the object was within view, the lights turned off.  The object was still there, I could see an outline/shadow of it.    I'm not sure of the shape because I was traveling at highway speed.   Once I passed under it and passed ahead of it I lost sight of it.  I couldn't pull over to get a better look because the traffic was moving pretty briskly and there were a number of trucks on the road preventing me from getting over to the shoulder.;34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065
