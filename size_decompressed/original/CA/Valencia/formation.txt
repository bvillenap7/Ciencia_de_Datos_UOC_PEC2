Flying aircraft being followed by small dark objects, behind the tail of the plan.;2005-11-06 16:00:00;1 minute;Flying aircraft being followed by small dark objects, behind the tail of the plan. On Sunday, 6 Nov. 05, at approximately 4:00 pm, my husband and I, stepped out onto our balcony. We see aircraft passing all the time, on their approach to Burbank, or LAX.   We were talking, when I heard an aircraft over head.  We both looked up to what appeared to be a military transport. flying or gliding behind and to the left and right of the tail were several (6 to 7) objects. The objects were to close to the aircraft to be escorting type aircraft.   I thought the aircraft could be dragging ballons behind the craft to be release at some point during flight.  From our point of view the objects appeared round and black in color.  My husband pointed out that we wouldn't be able to see ballons.   By the time I got my binoculars focused, the aircraft disapperaed into a cloud formation.;34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065
