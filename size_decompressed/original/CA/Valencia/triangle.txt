black triangle masks stars in Santa Clarita;1998-06-01 22:00:00;3 minutes;black triangle masks stars in Santa Clarita Summer 1998, in the backyard hot tub with my wife, in Santa Clarita, California.  Totally clear, starry sky.  Of course, I'm not looking at the sky, I'm looking at my wife's bikini top.  But she's looking at the sky (damn you, pot belly!), and she says, What's that?  We both look up, and there's this triangle shape obscuring the stars.   It's totally black, slowly moving from east to west, silently.  That's the thing I remember most, the silence.  Our neighborhood is very quiet, so any aircraft passing overhead is always audible.   In retrospect, I wish I had grabbed a camera, but this was when 1-megapixel digital cameras were state of the art and didn't come with shutter speeds, plus I was wet.  So we just watched this triangle mask the stars as it slowly cruised overhead.   From our view, the size was like if you put both your forefingers and thumbs together in the shape of a triangle and held your arms out.  There were no lights at all.  I have waited over 10 years to tell this story, and I present it here as fact witnessed by my own eyes.  I wasn't beamed up by a UFO with multicolored Christmas lights.  I saw a black triangle obscuring the stars. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065
Did I witness a ufo at about 330am, Feb. 6?;2001-02-06 03:30:00;5 minutes;Did I witness a ufo at about 330am, Feb. 6? I am acually quite nervous  sharing this information with you.  But since yesterday morning, I haven't been able to get it out of my head. The way it happened, all seemed to perfect, to be real. First, I was driving home while listening to 640AM which was educating us, the people, of this website. I get home and go straight online to look up this site, (I am always eager to educate myself currently reading the book Chaos- Making a New Science and I also read philosophy.) While I'm researching this site, my cordless phone gives off half a ring, mind you it's about 3:30am, and I was startled. Last year I had 3 strange incidents occur with both my home number and old cell number at about the same time. I even have witnesses for those incidents. (A sound like a baby's heart through an ultra sound.) So again, I was startled when my phone rang yesterday morning. I got off line quickly, and for some reason went to go look outside my kitchen window. That's when I saw the red and white lights coming forward, yet in sort of a side to side motion. I was thinking to myself, no way, this can't be happening. And continued to stare at the object to prove myself wrong of it's side to side motion. I went outside in my backyard and watched it fly over my house. It seemed to be in the shape of a triangle because of the white lights at the front point of it and on each end of what would be it's wings. On the bottom, there were two red lights that seemed to be pulsating and made a quiet humming sound. I tried to analyze it as best as I could so I would then be able to confirm to myself, that it was only a plane. But I was unable because of a glare or something from the white lights. I have no idea whether it was a ufo or not, I only know that the nature of it, seemed unfamilar to me.;34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065
Silent, triangular object with three dim, greyish lights;2003-11-26 20:00:00;15 seconds;Silent, triangular object with three dim, greyish lights My family and I were leaving a restaurant after a late dinner.  The night was clear and cold.  I noticed three greyish lights moving across the sky, approximately SSE.  At first, the lights reminded me of geese flying in formation, but after watching for a few seconds, they ultimately appeared to be part of one triangular object. There were lights at each point of the triangle, although the lighted areas themselves seemed rounded, not sharp-edged or pointed.  The lighted areas were dim and hazy, and they were fairly large in size compared to what appeared to be the relative size of the object.  It is possible that the lighted areas consisted of groups of smaller lights, but the lights were too dim to tell.  The lights were moving in a very smooth, consistent manner, and were moving in a straight line.  Ultimately, not very far away, the object faded away, as it had moved quite a distance fairly quickly.  However, a normal aircraft would still be easily visible at the point where this one effectively faded into the sky.  I could not see an outline of a triangular craft, as there was no moonlight in the sky, so it is also possible that there were three objects flying in formation.  However, I believe that most likely they were all part of one object.  The object was completely silent, and it was not directly overhead, although it was close to being so.  It was flying at a fairly low altitude, well below where planes fly in the area.  Any planes/helicopters flying even remotely close to where this object was are quite noisy and clearly heard.  Again, this object was completely silent, and it was moving much faster than an aircraft (at any altitude).  I have lived near airport flight paths in Los Angeles for many years, but I have never seen anything remotely similar to this object. My wife also saw the object, and she recalls seeing an outline of a triangular craft.  I have reviewed other reports from the NUFORC website, and the May 2003 report from Seattle, WA is very similar to my experience. ((NUFORC Note:  See other reports from AZ for this same date.

Sliver shaped white and silver object seen on I-5;2006-10-31 08:30:00;10sec;Sliver shaped white and silver object seen on I-5 Was driving on I-5 past the 14 interchange and saw a sliver shaped object moving slowly through a break in the clouds. It was silver and white with no detail, reached for my camera but it went back into the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

UFO sighting;2008-05-02 22:00:00;5-8 seconds;UFO sighting Hello my name is ((name deleted)) and I was refered to you by my brother in law ((name deleted)).  Friday night at about 10:30 pm my wife and I were sitting in the jacuzzi with our friends and their child. I looked up and spotted a grey aircraft that came from the east and flew to the end of the western horizon in about 5 seconds (I started counting when it was right over us) and no sound was coming out of it.  It had a delta shape, long white lights running front-to-back, but no collision lights flashing, it was totally silent and it slanted over towards the south before we lost sight of it. The altitude was roughly 5000 feet.  I have lots of air traffic over our house, so I am used to seeing private/commercial jets fly over all the time. Also, I go to air shows at Edwards AFB and Pt Mugu...Ive seen the SR-71, F-15, F-22, F-16, F-18, F-117, B-1B bomber, etc etc, so I know what military jets can do and what they sound like at high speeds, but this one was totally silent....not a whisper.  No way it was a satellite, cause Ive seen them before at the desert and I saw the space shuttle once. What really caught my eye was the speed of this craft....Ive never seen anything cross the sky so quickly. Perhaps something outta Groom Lake?  I am sorry, I cannot use my friends as witnesses because of privacy concerns, but my wife and I and our 10 year old son saw what I saw.  Ive never seen anything move so fast.

Day time 5 objects or one large object with 5 identifiable points;2017-02-12 15:00:00;3-4 minutes;Day time 5 objects or one large object with 5 identifiable points https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU5R4gP4C5o&feature=youtu.be   My kids and I go to the park often and we like to lay on the grass and look at the sky.  Today it is crystal clear with no clouds.  We often see airplanes fly overhead but this these were obviously not planes. I watched them for about a minute before pulling out my Galaxy Note 5 set to 1920x1080 30p with Image stabilization on. When I first noticed them I thought they were balloons but quickly realized they were not because of their size and speed. They moved like fighter jets changing formation darting around then getting back into various formations. because of how high they are and large about the size of airplanes I knew they were not normal, I knew I needed to record them. At the beginning of the video, they look very far away and tiny. It's unfortunate that smartphone cameras make things that are about the distance of an airplane look much tinier than they are because to the human eye these UFO's were much closer like looking up at an airplane flying over at about 2,000-3,000 feet. It was also clear these things were metallic as they were very reflective and would get easier to see as they maneuvered and changed direction in the sky. I zoomed in but because of how bright the sun was it was hard to see my screen which is why I loose them in conjunction with how fast they were moving across the sky. Lastly, I know it may lose some credibility because I put my product logos on the video but I have a family to support so I had to capitalize on this unique and puzzling experience with my kids. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be extremely credible.  He provided high-quality video of a cluster of objects, photographed against a blue sky.  The objects are seen to maneuver rapidly, relative to each other's positions.  PD));34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065
