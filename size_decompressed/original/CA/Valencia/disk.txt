For some reason I looked out the window on the driver's side and saw a large rounded disk hovering in the sky at an altitude of about 500 feet.  It must have had a diameter of at least 50 feet. It had flashing, sychronized chasing colored lights going around its diameter.  I couldn't tell the color of the craft as it was dark, but it appeared a dark silver. It just quietly hovered still in the sky and I thought at first it must be some novel attraction of the theme park, but I didn't understand how it could just hover with no propellers or wings.  A couple of times it moved very quickly sideways.  My husband didn't see it and the kids were asleep in the back.  It happened almost 30 years ago, but I will never forget it.  I expected to hear something on the news about it, but never did.  I wondered if I was the only one who saw it.  I am sorry I had no camera with me because no one believes it.

Becaue of the close experience, I conclude that persons seriously interested in subject matter may gain from our report. It was a warm Friday evening at around 09:00 PM in Valencia California (Old Orchard II). I was cleaning swimming pool because our children would swim the next day. To clean the pool I used a long pole with an attached brush. As I moved my arm up the pole I turned my head to the rear and saw a craft headed in my direction at a low altitude and with lights on the front. What caught my attention was the width and pancake layout of the lights. As I stared at it for about 8-10 seconds, I realized it was not a helicopter (I have group propulsion systems background and aeronautical engineering studies). I ran toward the back patio door (about 20 feet away) and called to my wife and children to come out and see it. My wife was the only one who did. As I turned with her to look, the craft was now directly over our house and stationery. Perhaps, the swimming pool lights attracted it. It was about 75 feet above us for 40 seconds. It made no sound, had circular windows in the lower portion of the upper dome, it had no visible connections and appeared as it were one solid piece, the skin was metallic, silver and shiny. We noticed a rectangular window about 8-10 feet long and 4 feet wide in the frontal leading edge but just beneath the front circular edge. There was an orange, redish light emanating from inside but could not see any occupants. The craft moved as if it were caught in a slight breeze but made no sound. It angled forward and downward for a few seconds. We could see rectangular shapes (2) that ran the diameter of the craft under the concave bottom. We also saw two ski like devices in the front lower side that seemed as hanging or docking devices rather than skis because they were to far in front of what I considered a center of gravity of the craft. The craft had a diameter of at least 75-100 feet with a height of at least a 1.5 story house. My wife kept repeating oh my god over and over again while I kept thinking take me with you! We decided not to discuss it but to draw what we each saw and then discuss it. I know this craft did not apply earthly technology. We will never forget the experience and continue to search the skies. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1980 is approximate.  Minor typos corrected at request of witness.

Three horizontally placed lights hovering in the sky, attached to an elliptical object.;2004-03-14 22:00:00;one hour plus;Three horizontally placed lights hovering in the sky, attached to an elliptical object. Looking out my bedroom window, I observed an unusual hovering object in the distance. The shape was somewhat difficult to see, as it was far away, and high, in a dark sky. However, three lights, in a horizontal row, each light seemingly multicolored (white, pink, green...but difficult to tell for sure) maintained the same position until I went to bed about an hour later. Possible blimp? Husband is an astrogeophysicist and said that it was the closest thing he's ever seen to a UFO.;34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065
