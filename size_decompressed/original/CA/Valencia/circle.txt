It was above us for about 40 seconds with no sound and seemed to hover/glide on the spot. We clearly saw design characteristics.Metallic highly shiny body, no visible linkage between metallic components, about 100 feet in diameter, portholes in the middle of what appeared to be an upper level or dome and bottom the porthole were all around the craft except for the front (on direction of forward movement.) There was a window that was angled inwards about 45 degrees in the front (forward direction). The window appeared to be in the under side of the craft. We could see orange/bluish light coming from the inside but did not see any occupants. The window was about 4-5 feet in height and probably about 10-12 feet in length. The craft had small ski like devices on either side (lower) of the frontal window but they seemed to be like docking devices like the shape of an S but the top of the S facing forward. Underneath craft were rectangular (2) long shapes that covered the diameter of the craft and in the middle section of the bottom side. The rectangular shapes were part of the body but protruded in rectangular shape. No insignias, just solid metallic body. I kept saying what a beautiful craft and my wife kept saying oh my god the whole time.The craft made no noise whatsoever. It seemed to levitate but with that slight side to side movement.At the time of sighting, I was cleaning my swimming pool a round 10:00 PM. The is a residential area (Santa Clarita Valley) where 10:00 PM is like 3:00 AM. I spotted the craft coming towards the house in a southwest direction and instantly knew that was not a normal shaped craft. I ran some 12 steps to the family room and called my family but only my wife ran out. As she did, the craft was right on top of us, motionless except for the slight gliding from side to side. It stood there about 40 seconds. It faced downwards and that is when I saw the window. I also could determine that swimming pool lights were not causing reflection on top side and that in effect it was highly reflective. After that it kept moving in the same direction at 40-50 MPH and began to disappear between homes. I jumped on top of a block wall and saw it continue (between homes) for at least 4-5 miles and then I could not see it.I told my wife not to discuss it but to draw what she saw as I did. I had more details but we agreed that we saw the same things.While we were seeing it, I made sure there was no helicopter suspending this craft.We called the local sheriff's office and they said they had no reports. The craft had to cross the Interstate 5 freeway to head towards my home and at the altitude which means someone had to see it on the freeway.There was a sighting filmed in Mexico City near some high rise buildings. What we saw resembled that very much. Please keep me posted. Since the experience I have read everything there is to read on the subject. I am confident the government knows more. This object was a solid craft and definitely not powered by anything man-made. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates no date for the sighting.  We have sent him an e-mailed request for the correct date, and have assigned an artificial date, for the time being.  PD));34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065

I tried to make out what they were but they were too far.  I saw them form a V shape wider longer version and then they disappeared.  They were too high to take a picture with my phone.;34.4151613821137;-118.55056504065
