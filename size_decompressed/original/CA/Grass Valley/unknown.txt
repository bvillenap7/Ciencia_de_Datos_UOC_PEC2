I was driving up Highway 49 towards Grass Valley and in the distance, very quickly, I saw a very bright, white light at a very high speed go up in the air and to my right.  It was a thicker light than a shooting star, by quite a bit.  It happened so fast but i've never seen anything like it.;39.171451;-121.037745
