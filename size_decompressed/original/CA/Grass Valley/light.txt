It did a strange turn.  Heard a slow hum, not like airplane.  Hum lasted for over half an hour.  Light reappeared about half an hour after first sighting and was traveling with a fast speed at a slanted angle towards the ground, and dissapeared. On the morning of July 31, 1998, at approximately 4.00 am, I saw a faint light in the sky, that appeared to be a star.  I was alone outside, with the only other person a few feet away, sleeping in a tent.  He did not observe the occurance.  The light was moving, and suddenly it shifted, turning to reveal a brighttness.  It then shrunk back into the smaller light, and dissapeared.  I believe that the object was turning.  At first, I thougth this was an airplane.  I made this conclusion because there was a hum in the air, like an engine.  I figured that the plane would be moving away quickly, and the hum would dissapear.  However, this did not happen.  The hum continued for over twenty minutes to half an hour, when the light reappear, further out towards the hills surrounding the area.  However, this time the light was traveling downwards, at an inclined angel, and traveling at a quick speed.  It moved downwards, and dissapeared.  The hum still remained, but I feel asleep under the night sky before I could make another sighting.;39.171451;-121.037745
Two star like objects flashing red, white and blue with unnatural intensity.;2012-03-09 01:30:00;Few hours;Two star like objects flashing red, white and blue with unnatural intensity. There were two objects in the sky that were way brighter than any star in the sky.  They were blinking red, white, and blue.  They seemed to be wiggling around and they constantly changed colors. One started out calmly blinking then got rapid and bright.  The other was blinking and flashing brighter than any star I've ever seen. One of the stars got dim and disappeared out of sight.  As soon as I told the other witness that it had gone away...  It reappeared in its spot with just as much intensity as before.;39.171451;-121.037745
The bright light did not have characteristics of an astroid and it decended like it was falling rather than streaking.;2016-08-19 22:00:00;1 minute;The bright light did not have characteristics of an asteroid and it descended, like it was falling, rather than streaking. I was driving north on Hwy 49, towards the town of Grass Valley, when I witnessed a very bright light high in the night sky, descending extremely fast toward earth.  It happened very quickly, and due to mountain terrain and tree coverage, I lost sight of it.   I did not see any fire or hear any explosion.;39.171451;-121.037745
Amazing straight line of 30+ lights traveling through the sky at a high rate of speed spaced equally.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-06 15:00:00;30 minutes;Amazing straight line of 30+ lights traveling through the sky at a high rate of speed spaced equally going in the same direction We are not sure what we saw but they were moving In a straight line from the South West to the North East They appeared to look like a jet liner would look at night at 30,000 feet but no flashing lights or sound, or a satellite would look.  They were also spaced equally apart, one behind the other they just kept coming.  They traveled through the sky in a short period of time.;39.171451;-121.037745
