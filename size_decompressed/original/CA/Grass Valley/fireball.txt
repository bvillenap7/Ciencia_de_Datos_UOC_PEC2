Test minuteman  or intersepeter rocket ?  ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD));2002-10-14 19:05:00;10 sec;Test minuteman  or intersepeter rocket ? At about 7:05 pm I was witnesing a bright comet like looking thing in the western skis ,but very low just above the horizon. So I pulled my van over and grabed the camera turned it on and was able to snap 4 so so pics before it blew up and all that was left was a tail that lingered for the next 5 minutes or so. The only people that were around were a couple of guys in the car wash, and they didnt speek english so well and I speek even less spanish, but  I pointed to the ski and they got the piture . When I got home my wife and kids thought  I had flipped a noodle until I showed them the pics on the pc, So two hrs had gone by and I had heard nothing on the news or on the net, so when I came across this site and I was filling in the time and date and what I saw .... I was haveing thoughts that I was even abducted .. Because my camera was saying 6:05 And I got home at 8:15 , Well after I took the pics , Its only a 10 minute drive Leaving about a 1 hr of time that I couldnt account for. Well yes thats right The cam had not been reset for daylight saveings time , O well the 10:00  news had the real digs on my abduction.. It was a minuteman  test out of Vandenberg air base ? But it was very cool and I was able to get pitures of it to . ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD));39.171451;-121.037745
