It was shaped like a boomerang or flattened V, I guess it is referred to as a chevron shape. It was all lighted, but not very bright, almost a translucent look to it with 5-7 lights with in it that were slightly visible, all white light though.  It was traveling from east to west at a moderate speed, at first glance it looked to be just over the trees, but I believe it was much higher.  We watched it traveling in a relatively straight path and then it was just gone.  I may have second guess myself except there were two of us and we described it exactly the same.  By the time the third one could catch a look at it it had blinked out or whatever you want to call it.;39.171451;-121.037745
