Three bright white lights in a row, in the sky.;2001-10-11 20:35:00;1 minute;Three bright white lights in a row, in the sky. My son and I were driving on Hwy. 49 South bound, nearing the McKnight exit, when we observed two large bright white lights, flashing alternately in the sky, above the tree line to our right. We observed them flashing continuously several times, then a third light in the middle appeared, at which time all three lights illuminated continuously, without flashing. My son observed a triangular outline, with the middle light protruding more than the other two lights.;39.171451;-121.037745

Orange object drops white orb.;2016-10-21 21:00:00;~10 minutes;Orange object drops white orb. I am submitting this on behalf of my stepson.  This event happened in the span of about 10 minutes. My stepson and his friend sitting around campfire in chairs, talking. He states he had noticed it out of the corner of his eye when he was talking to his friend his friend was facing towards the general direction of the object.  His friend asked him if he could also see it. At first they were thinking it was a drone.  The object was orange-red, about the size of a basketball from his perspective, appeared triangular shape but may have had an aura around it.  It was about 100 yards away. Discussion about recording/pictures took place, but there were issues with getting cameras/go pros going.  My stepson walked around to get a better view and the object moved, dropped a white orb and proceeded to move behind the trees.  It appeared to the west, i.e., it moved from east to west.  It hovered for a few minutes and then just disappeared. Incidentally, immediately afterwards, a sharp high pitched noise was heard that startled the both of them, but was dismissed as a bird. Observations about the object:  triangular shaped, orange-red, basketball sized, glowing, pulsating, no sound, one white orb ejected.;39.171451;-121.037745
