Some friends and I were camping on Yankee Jim's trail, an old mining trail near Grass Valley, in the gold rush country.  We were camped near an old Single lane suspension bridge, over the American River.   I had decided to sleep outside my tent, under the stars, while everybody else slept in tents.  At about 12:30 I noticed an object with four lights move over the top of one side of the river canyon. the lights were in a diamond shape and bright red, not flashing, not changing.  The object moved unusually slowly over the river canyon, and apeared to be no more than 50 feet over the tops of the hills.  The object took about 2min to cross over from one hill top to another, a distance of about 2-3 football fields.  There was no discernable sound at all.   Given all of these details together it unlike any aircraft I have ever seen.   About 20min later another object crossed the river, in as near as I could tell, the same exact path and hight over ther river.  Again, totally silent.   This object's four lights were in a triangle shape with one in the center. The one in the center changed colors in a seemingly random patern, while the others were solid red like the first object.    Then in another 20min another object crossed in the same path, hight, and silent manner.  The lights were again in a diamond shape, but only one remained solid red, while the three others were changing colors in a similar random pattern.;39.171451;-121.037745
