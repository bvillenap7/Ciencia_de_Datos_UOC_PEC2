Spectrum of bright colored rings reasembling a bull's eye;1982-07-22 20:30:00;45 seconds;In the summer of 1983 on a partial cloudy night around 8:30 PM, my cousin and I had a frightful experience, mine more frightful and unshakeable than hers. I was but twelve years old, my cousin two years older, and as we walked down to the gated community's (Lake of the Pines) clubhouse, we noticed the dogs that night barked more than what one would consider to be normal.  It was on our return home at 8:30 PM that we both looked up into the night sky, and there passing between the break in clouds directly overhead from west to east ,making no sound, a long oblong shaped craft that would dwarf a conventional 747 aircraft.  Located at the front of the craft on its side, a spectrum of bright colored rings reasembling a bull's eye. As the craft had passed we noticed that the dogs began to bark again, for all was quiet in that 45 seconds as it passed overhead.  We also became aware after it was over, that neither one of us told the other to look up at the exact same time, at the exact same spot in the sky, we just did. My cousin has put this behind her, regarding it as a strange event.  But my dreams of strange symbols and equations that make no sense to me, has never left my mind from that night forward.  It helps my well-being to speak of this for the first time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.171451;-121.037745
Red lights shining on a black or invisible flying/stationary object.;2011-12-23 22:58:00;9 minutes;Red lights shining on a black or invisible flying/stationary object. At 2258 hours I was driving heading South West on Hwy 49 coming down the mountain from Gold Flat/Ridge Road, I saw a flying object threw my front windshield with three constant red lights hovering in the sky close to the ground above tree tops.  It would stop then move toward me in a slow fluid motion then stop move toward me then  stop again. Taking the Hwy off ramp at Brunswick Road I waited at the stop light, and when it turned green turned left heading over the bridge East.  It seemed to me the stationary craft was very close to my destination so I decided to check it out.  I turned right on to Plaza Drive drove past the Flyers gas station.  At this moment I saw the craft start to move so I stopped in the road behind Perko's diner, shut off the engine, turned off the head lights, and got out of the vehicle, and stood behind the door.  The craft now had three lights but as it turned it revealed a forth. It made a complete 340 degree turn like a glider would (no sound) in a 20 foot diameter.  My approximation of distance is 300 yards, 170 feet from ground, over a wilderness area, (using the local cedar  trees as a guide), and only blackness between the red lights.  The lights made a X like any respective airplane would, and one was clearly definable as the front since motion forward stayed with that light.  From my estimation the lights were 20 feet apart, and they did not illuminate what they were attached to.  It was only 20 feet above the cedar tree tops, and completed its turn ending heading in a North East direction. It  looked to me that is was traveling at 2 Mph top, in a slightly lowering altitude. Losing sight of it behind trees I did not see it a gene. I did try to relocate it by estimating the drop speed, speed, and direction, but was unsuccessful.  Note- there is a local air port in the direction it was heading. I have gone threw a mired of emotions and thoughts about this. I have questioned myself over and over, on what exactly I had seen. The main point I keep reminding myself is that most of the time I watched this craft it was fixed motionless in the sky, and to the best of my knowledge we do not have that ability on our air craft. Second was the silence, it made no noise at all, and the traffic noise that might have masked that was almost nonexistent.  I will have to recall this account, and the main thing I will recall is that I can only classify what I saw as a unidentified flying object.;39.171451;-121.037745
Big scary thing come out of no where;2012-03-03 19:23:00;5 seconds;big scary thing come out of no where Me and two family members of my family where out looking at the stars. and out of no where a yellowish half circle with white dots on the edge.  I have never been so scared in my life.  I have never done drugs in my life and it was not just me that saw it.  My mom and my sister saw it two.

1 to 4 red blinking and bouncing red lights.;2013-05-01 10:10:00;1 minute;1 to 4 red blinking and bouncing red lights Me and a buddy were sittin a little past 11000 block of East Bennett Street and seen what appeared to us to be the helmet lights of a biker.  We had two Puppies in the vevichle at the time with us that reacted rather unnormally to whatever it was.  One cowered and whimpered while the other scratched at the door and barked at the window and object till it disappeared.  One thing wrong, they were red and they were in a perfect straight line. There were what looked like anywhere from 1 to 4 lights but could not figure out if it was one craft or mutiple.  They moved about 15 feet left across th road started bouncin randomly then dissappeared randomly as well.;39.171451;-121.037745
Light moving within stars which I was looking at then one began to move not straight moving to the left from me. No other lights/sound;2019-07-28 16:43:00;5 minutes;Light moving within stars which I was looking at then one began to move not straight moving to the left from me.  No other lights/sound Went outside to check on puppy.  Looking up at all the beautiful stars saw what appeared to be a star moving zig-zag for the most part straight line.  No other blinking lights as a plane....no sound as for a plane....very slow not a shooting star or meteor.;39.171451;-121.037745
