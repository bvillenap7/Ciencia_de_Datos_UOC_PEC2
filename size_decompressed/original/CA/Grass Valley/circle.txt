Giant lenticular cloud over music festival;1995-06-30 13:00:00;2-3 days;Giant lenticular cloud over music festival    My boyfriend and I were driving into Grass Valley.  There was a 3 to 4 day Bluegrass music festival going on at the fair grounds with people camping on the grounds. We were coming around the foothills of the Sierra Nevada into Grass Valley and saw a gigantic lenticular cloud over the whole fairgrounds.  It was awesome, I never saw anything like it before. They broadcasted the festival on the local Nevada City radio station KVMR.  People on the air were saying that they were taken up to a  a UFO and visited with aliens. It was a festive occasion and everyone was real happy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.171451;-121.037745
White circular object with indent slowly traveling across sky.;2014-05-26 12:30:00;1 hour;White circular object with indent slowly traveling across sky Standing in our driveway, looking up, as our borade ((sic.  borate)) planes were dropping borade on a fire, we noticed a round white circle object in the sky, not moving for a very long time.  It was slowly traveling sideways across the sky at straight line.   It was white with an indent in the middle.  Very slowly it moved across the sky and then disappeared.

While watching borate planes dropping borate on a fire that had started not far from us, we live in the mountains out of Grass Valley, California, my son-in-law spotted a small white dot way up above the borate planes that remained in one spot the whole time while we were watching the borate planes.  He got his binoculars and watched it for a while.  Said it was round and concaved in the middle.  My daughter was using her camera taking pictures of the planes and zoomed in on the object and took a picture.  The object stayed in one spot in the east of us and never moved for the two hours we were looking.   Donâ€™t know how long it had been there before we spotted it.   Later we went in the house, but my husband sat out for a while longer and said it very slowly moved to the north and faded out over about Tahoe area.   It was way above the borate planes. We have a very good photo of the object.;39.171451;-121.037745

I'm so happy I took this hobby up.  I can't even sleep now.  I'm still so excited.;39.171451;-121.037745
