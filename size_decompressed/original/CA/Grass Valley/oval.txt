My screen-less windows were open and my blinds were up.  I happened too see something in the sky directly north out my window at an angle above the horizon through some power lines about 100 yards distant from my house.  I saw it for 30 seconds or so, before it disappeared behind a solid tree. The object was slowly moving away from me in a NNE direction at about the speed of a jet airplane, but seemed likely to be at a lower altitude than would be typical of such a craft. Its appearance was extremely unusual and not at all typical of a conventional manmade aircraft or satellite.   It was small enough in size at what seemed to be a far distance of at least several miles away such that it briefly blinked from behind each line, before reappearing, similar to a star or satellite.  However, it was large enough that I could tell it was off-round in shape and a hazy orange in color, intensely bright in the center, and fuzzy on the edges.   The color of orange in a pitch black sky combined with the cloudy hue of color and imperfect shape impressed me as being unnatural and not manmade.  I have never seen anything like it.;39.171451;-121.037745
