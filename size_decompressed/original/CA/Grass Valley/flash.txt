Flash of light in Northern Sky near big dipper on Thursday 1/25/07 seen by two people.;2007-01-25 04:45:00;1 sec;Flash of light in Northern Sky near big dipper on Thursday 1/25/07 seen by two people. Just under the big-dipper a large flash of light appeared.   The light didn't move across the sky, nor did it move an any direction.  It was like a STAR expanded 1000 times the size and then went away.   I waited around for a sound or boom, but to no avail.   Three days later I am still thinking about this because stars do not expand like this.  Almost like a flashlight from the sky clicked on, then off suddenly.  The brightness was two times that of a star, but not blinding and 1000 times the size. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare, caused by an Iridium satellite.  PD));39.171451;-121.037745
Bright repetitive flashes during 2017 Perseid meteor showers.;2017-08-12 02:00:00;8-10 seconds;Bright repetitive flashes during 2017 Perseid meteor showers. An unusual nighttime sighting, both alone, and with friends, during the recent 2017 Perseid meteor shower was dismissed as some sort of odd, but probably explainable, visual illusion.  But 4 evenings later while driving I was listening to Coast to Coast and heard a mention of several similar accounts reported from the U.S. and Turkey, so will add our experiences (in two reports) to the mix. Around 2:00 AM on Saturday, August 12, 2017, I had just returned home to Grass Valley, CA, after a flight from Phoenix, AZ, and after unpacking the car went back outside to see if any of the Perseids might be visible.  There were very few but while looking NNE at around 3:00 AM there was an extremely bright blue-white flash about 35° up which lingered and faded for maybe a full second, followed quickly by another dimmer flash, and then a couple more that were even fainter, although not at regular intervals.  At first I assumed it was a plane, but it was stationary and there were definitely no colored running lights or associated sounds.  I’m familiar with helicopters doing nighttime searchlight operations, but the lights were just flashes with no downward beam.

((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be exceptional eloquent, and he seemed to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.   Please see a second report of a similar sighting by the same witness, which occurred at 2200 hrs. (PDT) on Sunday, August 13, 2017.

Bright repetitive flashes during 2017 Perseid meteor showers.;2017-08-13 22:00:00;1.5 hours;Bright repetitive flashes during 2017 Perseid meteor showers. Following a similar sighting on the previous evening of Saturday, August 12, 2017, I accepted an invitation on Sunday, August 13, 2017, from a former pastor friend and his wife to have dinner and then go outside and watch the Perseid meteor showers before the moon rose.  After seeing a couple of very large ones, at about 10:00 PM the 3 of us witnessed a very similar repeat of the bright blue-white flash event at the same elevation and direction as I’d seen the previous night (as reported separately).  This was also followed by perhaps 6 or 7 less intense flashes at irregular intervals, but their location kept randomly shifting slightly to the left or up or down.  As the flashes became fainter, they moved slowly down and to the ESE for a considerable distance, finally becoming too faint to follow although by this time my pastor friend was tracking them with binoculars trying to see any detail (to no avail).  My friends then told me that they’d seen similar fl! ashes in the same location at about the same time the night before. Then, at around 11:30 PM there was a reoccurrence of the flash at exactly the same position in the sky and just as brightly, followed by a couple of irregular but fainter ones, all with no apparent change in position and this time not followed by the receding movement of fainter flashes. After solidly dismissing the idea of any sort of aircraft we speculated that it might be flashes from a reflective panel on a rotating satellite or space station.  But the irregularity of the flashes and the extreme brightness of the initial flash or two seemed to discount any sort of regular rotational cause.  It left us clueless but not at all alarmed, thinking it might just be some sort of optical illusion that would find explanation later.  But there was no mention of any similar sighting in Monday’s local newspaper. My companions have an amateur interest in astronomy and night sky viewing.
