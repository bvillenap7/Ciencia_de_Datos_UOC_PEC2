A bright light that left a trail.;2005-09-04 21:10:00;6 seconds;A bright light that left a trail. On 9-4-05 I was looking outside from my second floor window. I was looking down on the ground. I noticed a bright light coming from the sky, as if it was a full moon. I realized the there was no moon. The light appeared to be a stoplight, so I looked up. The shape of the light was like the top half of a circle and the lights was coming from the middle portion of the circle. There was no bottom portion of the circle. It was extrememly bright. As I looked at the light it seemed to closed. Then I saw a trial go southeast. There was no sound of a plane or helicopter. It was relatively close to the forest floor. I called my neighbor and I told him about the incident and he said it maybe a meteor, but on Tues and Wed night a military plane flew overhead very low,so now I', wondering if it was really a UFO. Which was my first thought.;39.6769;-121.3685
