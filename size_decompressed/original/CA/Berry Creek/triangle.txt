Then all of a sudden out of know where this huge fast tree top flying triangle craft flew right over our roof at super high speed but hardly made a noise with red, blue, and green flashing LED tripe lights and seem to follow the contour of the ridges and valleys.  It was out of sight in seconds and everything was silent.   Then I noticed off to the West over the Ocean a huge blinking light flashing Green, Blue, and reds lights twinkle in a stationary position.  The same sphere with the same lights hovered to the north over northern California. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
