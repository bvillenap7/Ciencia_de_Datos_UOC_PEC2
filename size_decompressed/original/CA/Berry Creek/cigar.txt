A single bright, red light (almost star-like but larger) streaked across the sky above us making a thunder-like sound before settling above a mountain range an unknown distance away it then held position and began flashing a sequence of lights as if it was spinning.  It seemed to have a red light at its core with yellow lights blinking in sequence on the outside.  After a couple of minutes, a second identical light pattern emerged from the first one and began erratic flight patterns around the first one which seemed to stay in the same spot. After performing maneuvers impossible for an aircraft to achieve (moving straight up and down vertically and laterally with the pattern of lights remaining the same), both craft departed in different directions before we lost sight of them in the darkness.;39.6769;-121.3685
