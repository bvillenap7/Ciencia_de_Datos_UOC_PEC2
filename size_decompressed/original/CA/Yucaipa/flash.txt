flashing light ufo in So California;2010-08-18 05:30:00;15-20 seconds;flashing light ufo in So California i woke up at about 5:30 am to go to the restroom and happened to look out my window.  In the south sky heading east at what seemed to be a pretty good speed was a set of six flashes of light, two sets of three lights that took turns flashing.  The set of lights on the right would flash three times then the set on the left would flash three times.  I saw no physical shape, just those six lights, but they were pretty close together giving the feeling of one craft. i watched it for a little more than fifteen seconds before it disappeared behind some trees.;34.0282000000001;-117.0372
