Orangish Light emitting flashes or sparks;2006-02-05 23:00:00;1 minute;Orangish Light emitting flashes or sparks I saw this same event and have seen this same type UFO numerous times. See my description on 10/23/05 on this site. Someone tried to claim that what I have seen is some form of ballon using candles for lift? I don't buy that explaination. I don't know what it was that I've seen but the video sure doesn't appear to be a balloon.  I have about 3 minutes of video footage of what I, my wife and two sons saw that night. It isn't the best footage but it clearly shows exactly what you have described and what I have seen numerous times over the last year or so in the Yucaipa area. It also shows one light turn it triangle shaped light pattern.;34.0282000000001;-117.0372
