Cone shaped object moving obliquely along a straight path of travel.;2016-10-09 18:17:00;3 minutes;Cone shaped object moving obliquely along a straight path of travel. On October 9, 2016, at 18:17hrs, I witnessed a dark, cone shaped object moving slowly in a South/South West direction. What caught my attention was that the object was moving in an oblique pattern, precisely changing direction along a straight path. I retrieved my binoculars, and observed that there was what appeared to be an antenna/sensor array protruding horizontally from the top of the object. I maintained visual contact until it was out of my range of sight @ 18:20hrs. I viewed this event from the North Eastern portion of Yucaipa, CA.;34.0282000000001;-117.0372
