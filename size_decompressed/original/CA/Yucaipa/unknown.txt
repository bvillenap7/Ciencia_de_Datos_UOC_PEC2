Very slow, low rumbling noise with no visible lights or shape, flew in an easternly direction over Yucaipa, CA at 2:40am on 11/04/00;2000-11-04 02:40:00;15 minutes;Very slow, low rumbling noise with no visible lights or shape, flew in an easternly direction over Yucaipa, CA at 2:40am on 11/04/00 About 20 minutes ago I came home from the University of Redlands, and as soon as I stepped out of my truck I heard a very low rumbling vibration far off to the west.  I didn't recognize the sound but as it moved slowly closer the vibrations became more intense and louder.  Whatever was making the low rumbling was up in the sky above my house. There were no lights that I could see, and the speed of the ufo seemed to be very slow.  I often hear hellicopters and airplanes fly over, but this noise was like no other I have ever heard.  After it passed over my house, causing local dogs to bark, i stood and listened to it creep out to the east.  And about 5 minutes after it passed over me i could still hear and feel the vibrations. But never once did i see any lights.  The whole duration of sound lasted about 15 minutes until it flew over the mountians. ((NUFORC Note:  We find this to be a very interesting report, primarily since we have received many such reports from northern California.  It occurs to us that the U. S. military may be flying some type of aircraft that produces a loud rumbling noise, which is detectable at ground level, even when the aircraft is at high altitude.  PD));34.0282000000001;-117.0372
