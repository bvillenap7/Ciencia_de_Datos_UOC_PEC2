The object slowed and appeared to change directions ESE.   As the object continued to travel over the Yucaipa area, the object appeared to begin dropping red and white lights.  The red lights stayed the same size as they descended.   As the white lights descended from the object, the lights became very bright and then faded as they descended.  The object continued to travel away from the falling lights and disappeared. I would describe falling from the object similar to a firework however, the distance traveled, the change in speed from slow-fast-slow and the fact that the initial object stayed intact and continued to travel after the lights had completely descended to the ground, would lead me to rule out the possibility that the object was a firework.   It should be noted that the object disappeared from sight beyond 1 mile from the point the lights appeared to have dropped.   At least 15 lights descended from the object in no particular pattern.  They did not appear to be propelled and fell vertically.   There was no sound, no explosions the object did not appear to lose size as the objects descended from it.
