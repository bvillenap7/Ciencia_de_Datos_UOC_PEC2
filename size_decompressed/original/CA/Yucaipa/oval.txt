BLURRED OVAL SHAPE LIGHT MOVING IN ANTI CLOCKWISE MOTION BEHIND THE CLOUDS FOR AN HOUR AND COUNTING AT 11PM PST;2007-08-30 23:00:00;30 Mins +;BLURRED OVAL SHAPE LIGHT MOVING IN ANTI CLOCKWISE MOTION BEHIND THE CLOUDS FOR AN HOUR AND COUNTING AT 11PM PST Since about 10:30 PST my husband and I are observing the following in Yucaipa. East of our home, an oval shaped light/blurred is moving in an anti clockwise large circular motion across the sky, making large circlesâ€¦well actually more of an oval pattern. It is almost as large as a full moon, but not as bright. There is cloud cover and it seems that the light is behind the clouds as opposed to in front of it. During its rotation it seems to be fainter (less bright) on the lower/bottom part of its rotation. There is no beam extending to or from this light. The area of the sky it is happening is over what is typically more remote or desert and not an area where there are car dealers that usually have those very large advertising lights. The clouds in the sky over the past hr are not really moving across the sky, so the light continues to move behind the same cloud formation. It is 11:31 now and this light and its movement is still continuing.;34.0282000000001;-117.0372
