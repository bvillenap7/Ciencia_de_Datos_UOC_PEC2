After picking up my daughter from church, she noticed a strange light to the right of our car.  The object was oval with white lights all over it.  I also blinked a red light about every 2 minutes.  The object was slowly moving away from us.  I drove towards the object, to see if we could identify it.  However, we were never able to identify the object.  The object disappeared after about 15 - 20 min.;33.9776000000001;-117.7375
