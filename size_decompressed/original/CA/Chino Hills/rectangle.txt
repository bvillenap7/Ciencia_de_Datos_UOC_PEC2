Sighting of inter-dimensional craft over Chino Hills, CA on 4/30/14.;2014-04-30 17:00:00;10 seconds;Sighting of interdimensional craft over Chino Hills, CA on 4/30/14. Very long rectangular shape.  At least as long as the length of 3 commercial airlines laid end to end.   Had a silvery color along the whole length, but had a rounder looking, brightly shining component at one end only.  Traveling slowly from east to west is my guess. Heading more northwest than west. I watched it completely dematerialize over the course of about 3-4 seconds.  The sky was completely clear due to high winds.  No smoke from the Rancho Cucamonga fire was in the area.  You could see the smoke in the distance, but no smoke or clouds were anywhere around the craft. I saw this ship twice about an hour apart.  Looked exactly the same so I assume it was the same craft. These ships are inter-dimensional.  You can actually SEE them disappear.;33.9776000000001;-117.7375
