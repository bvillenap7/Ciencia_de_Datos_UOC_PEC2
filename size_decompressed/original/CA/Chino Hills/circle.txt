Blue disc moving at incredible speed high above mountain range;2007-08-30 21:00:00;2 to 3 seconds;Blue disc moving at incredible speed high above mountain range I observed a blue or bluish-green disc in the sky above the San Gabriel range which is about 30+ miles from my home which is on a hill of about 1,000 feet above sea level.  The disc was east of Mt. Cucamonga and was above the Cajon mountain pass.  When I first noticed the disc, it was stationary.  It then descended from its position high above the mountain range moving diagonally from right to left at an angle of about 45 degrees.  It covered that entire distance in less than three seconds.  I see many commercial planes in the valley flying into and out of Ontario International Airport, which is in the valley below the sighting.  I would judge the object to have been three or four times larger than a large airliner.  The object could have been larger as I have no way of knowing its distance from my location.  It descended at a steady pace and disappeared from view behind the mountain range, so I feel certain it was not over the valley as its size remained constant.  There was no tail, no glow, no pulsating. no other lights.  Just a blue circle that moved at incredible speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.
