Three bright Yellow/Orange round spiked objects in diagonal line.;2013-05-29 09:11:00;5 minutes;Three bright Yellow/Orange round spiked objects in diagonal line. I was out in my backyard with my dogs and I saw three bright yellow objects in a diagonal line. I thought at first that it was a satellite but it was too big to be one and the shape was all wrong.  The simplest way I am able to describe it is, is to think of a drawn five point star but with a round body and points in all angles around the center.  It was definitely not a plane but it was not a star!   I got it on video and its on my YouTube but it said not to put any contact info.  The whole event happened a duration of around five minutes.  The objects stayed in one place for most of the time but the second one would occasionally disappear for a split second and then reappear around the same area.;33.9776000000001;-117.7375
