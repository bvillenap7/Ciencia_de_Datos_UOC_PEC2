White Lights Over Inland Empire CA;2010-12-06 18:00:00;1hr;White Lights Over Inland Empire CA Monday December 6th 2010  I was driving on Interstate 91E after work around 6:00pm and saw a very bright what I thought to be a star in the sky.  On this Monday the sky was very clear after a weekend of rain and stars could be seen with clarity.  After being taken back by the size and brightness of the star I noticed it started to flicker as if it were a helicopter or as if a Christmas tree light were hanging in the sky.  After about five minutes of the flicker the light began to dull out as if it was a short, then I noticed a change from white to red and then it was gone in a blink of the eye.  After about 2 or three minutes I noticed the bright bright star once again in the same spot, as if it had never went away it just appeared out of no where.  It was once again still and bright white, I noticed it for another 5 min and then once again is started to dull out and vanish.  After doing this twice now when it returned as it did before this time there were three bright lights making a triangular shape. I called my mom to confirm what I was seeing and she saw the same from her back yard.  The lights stayed for about half an hour with all of them changing from bright white to red to vanishing. After seeing this I have done some research and found a group of people who saw the same event about two months ago in the same location as I did and took a video, this is exactly what I experienced.   There video is listed on the following site:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcIRkkm2IoI;33.9776000000001;-117.7375

We were facing a hill, just chatting before he had to leave for work.  We also talked about aliens, abductions, or just anything that's fun enough to talk about.  We were discussing 2012, transcendence into space, etc.  Right in front of us, in perfect view, the brightest flash of light I've ever seen was in the sky.  My boyfriend looked behind him, thinking it was a police officer or someone flashing a light on us--haha-- and I was fixated on the light.  It was a pretty big circle, with blue/green lights in a perfect circle, with a big light in the middle of it.  It flashed a few times, then all the lights came together and it left. It was a cloudy night, and definitely was not lightening, but similar.  The lights were the craziest part to me.  It looked like northern lights. Whatever was the in sky was there long enough for me to shout, 'What is that?!' oh my god, aliens? what are those crazy bright lights?! and then I got out of the car, heart racing, and watched it leave. I tried looking online for reports, twitter updates, etc.  The only thing I got was this  olliepires  Either it's a UFO or lightening in my backyard    AlexI3eck WTF WAS THAT THING IN THE SKY?! UFO WITH @CALLIMARIE!!! ball lightening?!?;33.9776000000001;-117.7375
Green to red lights over Inland empire, SoCal;2015-08-07 23:15:00;4 minutes;Green to red lights over Inland empire, SoCal We were driving on route 71 toward corona thru chino hills when my son asked what were the two green lights outside his window.  There were two lights spaced similarly to where plane lights are but instead of red and white they were bright green.   After a few moments the two lights expanded to 3 and the 3rd light was white.  The lights were in a straight line formation.  When the white light appeared the green lights changed to red.  Once the two lights turned red the 3rd light turned red and then all lights started flashing.   It was so abnormal that we submitted a note to the local TV station to see If others reported the same.;33.9776000000001;-117.7375
