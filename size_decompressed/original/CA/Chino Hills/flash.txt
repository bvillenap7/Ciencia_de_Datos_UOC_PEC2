Greenish/yellow flashes that made it daytime.;2018-02-13 22:48:00;2 seconds;Greenish/yellow flashes that made it daytime. We were driving south on the 71 when we saw a flash greenish/yellow that lit up the whole area that made it look like day time.  At first we thought it was probably a some sort of lightning, when 15 seconds later another flash occurred exactly the same way.   It was something we didn't understand at the time, but was amazed how that flash made the night seem like it was morning.;33.9776000000001;-117.7375
