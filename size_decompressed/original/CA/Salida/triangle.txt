triangle shaped ufo in salida, ca.june 20000;2000-06-20 20:00:00;10 minutes;triangle shaped ufo in salida, ca.june 20000 I was on the phone to my sister in the back yard. I told her there was a really bright star in the southern sky to go out in her yard and look. she was about a mile from where we lived. the light was slowly getting closer and was really low to the trees tops , then it went right over my yard , there was no sound I was telling my sister to look toward my house she said she couldn't see it because of the trees. this thing I tought at first was a stelth but then when it was over me I seen the bottom. It had no real wings just rounded triangle ends and it had a bubble like area on the bottom of it. The end as it passed had red ,yellow/white purple/blue lights across the end or back of it . I watched it leave and then a really fast american military jet was flying behind I think he was trying to catch that thing. he wasn't keeping up with that thing. I was still on the phone and told my sister the whole thing I just saw, and that I didn't feel well , I tryed to walk up the back stairs and fell three times and I don't drink or do any drugs, I called for help and my daughter helped me in the house . I vomited for about a half an hour afterward and was sun burned on my  face and really hot. I pray this was our governments and not something unexplainalbe.
