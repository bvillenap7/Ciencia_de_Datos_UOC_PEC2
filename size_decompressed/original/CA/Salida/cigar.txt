At about 10:30 pm,as we packed up to leave we noticed a bright colored gold object in the distance.  We thought that it was another model airplane so we decided to drive closer to it and watch it.  As we headed closer to the origin we could see that it was not a model airplane.  It was cigar in shape and hoovered approximately 20 feet above the almond orchards.  We were not the only ones that saw it.  We exited on the Hammet Ave exit and there were plenty of other cars on the overpass that were braking to watch these strange lights.  We then decided to chase it down.  This is an area filled with nothing but almond orchards.  It took us awhile but we finally made it to the general area.  It hoovered there in the middle of the almond orchard approximately a 1/2 mile away from us .  We turned our head for 3 seconds and the object was gone.
