Two lighted circular UFO's play follow the leader;1997-12-15 20:00:00;10 Seconds;Two lighted circular UFO's play follow the leader When I was about 12 years old, my little sister had written a letter to Santa Clause.  It was a couple weeks before Christmas.  I told her that I would take it to the mailbox for her.  It was night and already dark.  The sky was cloudy and as I was walking out of my doorway I looked up.  These clouds were very high in the sky and in them, or near them, I saw two lights.  The two lights were round and sort of yellowish, they were not very bright, about as bright as a flashlight.  I saw these two objects following each other.  One seemed to be leading the other.  They were moving in small circles around each other, also making figure eights and very semi-circle movements.  They continued this for about 10 seconds before they both shot off into the night.
