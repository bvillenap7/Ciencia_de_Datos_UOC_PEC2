Bright star with red flashing;2000-04-01 21:00:00;2:15;Bright star with red flashing Our bedroom window faces south giving us an unobstructed view of the ocean and that part of the sky. We routinely sleep with our blinds open to view the stars... what few of them we can see here in the light polluted southern California sky. At about 9pm I saw what I initially thought was an unusually bright star. It was brighter than anything in the sky. I would describe it as nearly the same color as those new auto headlights... the kind that make other headlights look yellow by comparison. Same with this star -- it made the others look yellow by comparison. Another unusual attribute of this star was that it seemed to flicker more than other stars. At about 10pm I noticed that there was a red flash in the star. I got out my binoculars to confirm. The red flashing didn't look like that of an aero plane. It was random, not steady like an aircraft. My thought at this time was that is was some kind of natural space event like a sun going nova or something. I hadn't detected any movement up to this point. I called a couple of my ham radio buddies to ask if they could see it. One could view it by standing on a ladder. It's about 10:20pm now. My buddy noticed it was moving very slowly... like the minute hand on a clock. He said it was dropping relative to the phone wires. He couldn't see the red flashes per say, but thought the atmosphere was altering the color and causing the unusual flickering. We also noticed it was starting to dim. From then on I made note of the movement and brightness of the object. At this point I was thinking that it was falling out of the sky and on fire, gradually growing dimmer as the fire burned out... maybe it was a weather balloon. Eventually I threw out that idea and decided it was not falling but remaining an the same altitude and moving south-west away from me... growing dimmer as the distance increased. I continued to observe the object until about 11:15 pm when it went dimmed to nothing. My opinion at this time, Sunday morning, it that this was some kind of very high altitude aircraft.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
A shooting bright red light intermittently visible in eastern sky near Saturn.;2004-09-04 06:30:00;5 seconds;A shooting bright red light intermittently visible in eastern sky near Saturn. While attempting to view Saturn/Venus through intermittent cloud cover early Friday morning, my husband and I witnessed what appeared to be a red light falling through the sky.  There were four separate sightings of this light, which appeared high in the eastern sky very close to Saturn. Each sighting lasted approximately 5-10 seconds, and spanned a total period of about 10 minutes. The unusual light (or object) was similar in appearance to the red dot that is produced by a lazer pointer, but brighter and larger. It appeared to be rapidly falling in an s shaped pattern, almost as if it was weaving in and out of the clouds. However, this description is somewhat inaccurate since we were able to view it clearly through the heaviest parts of the morning mist/cloud cover, even when Saturn (and everything else) was temporarily obstructed from our view. I am not sure whether this could have been a reflection from some sort of dust particles, since the sun was just coming up on the horizon. However, I have been star gazing for a while and have never observed anything this unusual. If anyone else witnessed something similar, or has any idea what it could be, please post it, as I am totally mystified.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Orange light traveling parallel to the Pacific coast emitting streaks of orange light.;2004-10-02 23:28:00;4 minutes;Orange light traveling parallel to the Pacific coast emitting streaks of orange light. An orange light was sighted, hovering at first then continued heading southwest parallel to the beach. As it moved across the sky, it ejected what looked like molten metal that left traces as it fell. It ejected material for 5 or 6 times as we watched it. It was very high in the sky, at least 4000 feet, I would say.  I've searched your site and found 15 sightings of the same object ejecting material in California alone. I mapped all 15 on to a map of CA, it has been seen all over the state, since 2002. I just found the same sighting in Phoenix,AZ on 6/1/05 at 23:00 hours, an orange light emitting balls of light.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Large craft with two red lights hovering in sky tracked by a police helicopter for several minutes.;2006-10-02 22:45:00;10 minutes;Large craft with two red lights hovering in sky tracked by a police helicopter for several minutes. At approximately 10:45 p.m., a few friends and I were on our third story deck when we witnessed a strange object with two red lights hovering in the sky. Even more peculiar is that this object was being tracked by a police helicopter, which kept circling the object and shining a high intensity beam of light on it. The object did not move like any sort of aircraft we have even seen, and appeared almost stationery for five minutes before it gradually started moving downward until it eventually disappeared from view below the horizon. The helicopter began to fly at rapid speed in what appeared to be an attempt to track the object as it continued to move just below the tree lines for several more minutes. We were able to view the object while it was still high over our house with a pair of very good binoculars. Upon closer examination, one could clearly make out two very bright red lights that were close together. Its overall size appeared to be almost the same as the police helicopter's. Anything more than that would be pure speculation. However, as a person who frequently watches planes and similar craft flying over my house, I can positively state that these lights were not coming from any type of airplane advertisement, helicopter, remote controlled toy craft, or weather balloon, due to the extremely peculiar way it was able to just hover without really moving for several minutes and then take off very quickly. Also, if it made any noise from an engine, we couldn't hear it, but that may have been due to the loudness of the helicopter nearby. I don't expect the police to actually own up to chasing this thing, which is why I am reporting it here. However, I will attempt to follow up on this tomorrow by checking the local news reports and the Huntington Beach police blotter. I will submit another entry if I find anything else out.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Orange orb moves east then west over Huntington Beach;2008-12-02 21:15:00;10 Minutes;Orange orb moves east then west over Huntington Beach Orange Orb Light In Huntington Beach  I was driving west on Bolsa Street and noticed an orange light in the sky.  It was a color like I’ve never seen before, kind of like a candle flame.  The light was moving east and was south of me.   I stopped at the store at Springdale and Bolsa Streets.  I watched the light move slowly east for about a minute.  (I REALLY wish I took a picture of it now)   I went into the store for about five minutes.  When I came out the light had moved west and was almost overhead.  It was an overcast night so the clouds reflected the orange glow.  I’m guessing that the clouds were about 1500 feet up that night. There was a slight wind out of the south, the light did not seem to be affected by the wind as it moved east then west, it stopped and moved slowly, there was no sound.  I drove home for about 3 minutes and when I parked my car and got out I could still see the light.  It was still moving west and was lower in the sky since I had moved about a mile north of it.  I went inside my house and changed out of my clothes.  About 5 minutes later I went outside looking south and the light was still moving west. I watched the light from my front porch for about 2 minutes then it moved up really fast and disappeared into the overcast cloud layer.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393

It moves slowly, stopping then moving again, to the east.  I went to grab my cell phone The Orange light was still there when I came back but it had stopped moving.  As I watched it and tried to turn on my phone (battery dead) it just disappeared as I watched.  This was a perfectly clear night.  I could see the star Sirius and the Big Dipper, very clearly.  The Orange light was brighter than the stars, but just a little dimmer than Sirius.  The Orange light was visible for about two minutes.  Then I saw a second Orange light much higher in the sky, coming from the northwest and moving in the direction where the first Orange light had vanished.  These two lights were unmistakably the same color orange, as I had seen on December 2, 2008.  The Orange light went to about the same area where the first one disappeared, and then it vanished.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Nighttime UFO Fleet Sighting - Orion - Huntington Beach-California - December 2008;2008-12-12 23:30:00;2 Minutes;Nighttime UFO Fleet Sighting - Orion - Huntington Beach-California - December 2008 December 12, 2008 11:30 PM  My wife was outside and noticed a fleet of lights moving across the night sky. She asked me to come look at this.  I looked up and saw what looked like bright stars moving from northwest to southeast across my night sky. She pointed out three of the lights in the middle of the group that were moving in a diagonal row.  There were scattered clouds that night moving west to east. The lights just kept coming and coming. There had to be at least a hundred of these lights in all. They were all moving at the same speed and direction, maintaining the same distance from each other, across the night sky. The lights were slightly different in colors and brightness, some were pure white and bright, some were slightly orange-red, and some were blue-white. To us they all appeared to be at the same altitude moving swiftly, taking over a full minute to cross over our entire night sky. It was just amazing how many of them there were, and the speed they must have been going. I’ve seen many satellites in the past moving across the night sky and these lights were moving at twice the speed of them. Once the fleet had moved past us there were no more lights trailing behind. The next morning I thought about the three stars that my wife had pointed out to me when I had first joined her outside. Then it hit me, Orion, the constellation of Orion, the belt!  That night I showed her the constellation of Orion in the sky I asked her if anything looked familiar? Without hesitation she pointed to the three stars of Orion’s belt. I printed out a picture of Orion and held it up over my head, as strange as this might be, I feel that the fleet of lights was moving in the formation of the constellation Orion. Has anyone ever seen, or have there ever been any reported sightings like this?;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393

I looked up and noticed some clouds and several stars.  The stars were moving west and I noticed the Big Dipper.  I then saw something that looked like a star moving North.  I thought it might be a plane but wondered how high a plane would have to be to look like a star.  I lost sight of it for 2 minutes behind some clouds.  As the clouds moved I could see it again moving South.  Again I thought it must be a flight pattern but I don’t know.  I saw only a white light.  No red or flashing lights.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Two bright blue lights in western sky southern california;2009-09-18 04:15:00;1 minute +;Two bright blue lights in western sky southern california I woke at 0400'sh and was going to the bathroom.  Looking out my bathroom window I saw what I originally thought was fireworks (at 0400?).  Two blue lights were in the west and went straight up then stopped.  Thinking again I thought it might be the HB Police helicopter but there was no sound.  Then it shot right, slowly went up and I was losing sight in the bathroom.  I went in the backyard and continued to watch.  The two blue lights were together and went from left to right, down then up at various speeds.  I called for my wife who woke up, came outside but it was gone.  First time EVER seeing anything like this.  It was in the western sky at about 0415 in the morning and someone else must have seen it.

Zig-zagging point of light.;2010-07-23 21:30:00;5:00;Zig Zagging Point of light My boyfriend and I were walking along the beach near Huntington Beach Pier and we were gazing at the stars.   We noticed what we thought was a shooting star and watched as it darted across the epanse of the sky.  This point of light then began to zig zag ever so slightly from its parabolic path.  We also noticed a red blink, which led us to initially believe it might be a VERY high flying plane.  Again, the light zig zagged from its path, then fell back into line. From the time we began watching it from about the middle of the dome of the sky to our left horizon, the light took less than a minute to cross the sky (much, much more quickly than other planes in the sky at much lower altitudes.)  We placed our event time estimation on the time it might have taken for the light to begin at one end of the sky to the other, prior to us watching.

Five strange red lights moved silently over Orange County on 12/25/13 at around 8:40 p.m..;2013-12-25 20:40:00;10 minutes;Five strange red lights moved silently over Orange County on 12/25/13 at around 8:40 p.m. It was Christmas night 2013 around 8:40 p.m.  My parents and I saw five strange red lights appear on the horizon from the Southeast heading Northwest.  They flew in single file formation about 30-60 seconds apart.  They made no sound and had no strobes or other lights that you would typically find on commercial aircraft.  All five of the lights faded in a flickering manner and disappeared in the same location.  They appeared to be very high in altitude and might have been climbing at the time they disappeared.  I've been watching aircraft fly over Huntington Beach at night for more than 30 years and I've never seen a set of lights like these from this location.  I'm also sure they were not Chinese lanterns because they covered too much distance in a very short period of time.  Their speed also appeared to be steady and it didn't appear to change.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393

I pulled into my drive way and noticed a single orange orb in the northern sky.  I initially thought it was Mars.  I got out of my car to take a closer look and noticed it was moving slowly from north to south then turn to south-west.  The object was larger than typical stars and comparable to venus on a clear night.  The orange orb did not have any blinking lights and did not make a sound.  Either the light disappeared or went behind the clouds.  The phenomenon lasted approximately 5 minutes.   Land marks in my view for reference were my power lines in my back yard.  This is how I know it was moving and turning.  It did not make any abrupt turns or change speeds.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393

It remained shining in the sky for about 40 seconds, then slowly closed up like the aperature of a camera lens. It wasnt until about an hour later that i reviewed the video that i had taken and realized that it wasnt a ufo.  It was a portal that had opened and then closed.  The video is on you tube, and is pretty crappy due to driving/filming in morning rush hour traffic, but luckily there is a enough very clear video of the the portal to get a decent understanding of what happened.  Note) Another person in Newport Beach, (a neighboring city), filmed the same event and his video was featured on a well known you tube channel that has recently had all of its videos removed and some other mysterious events occur.
