300' cigar,silver,10 windows w/soft corners, 200' off ground, traveling from ocean inland at less than 50 mph.;1973-06-15 06:00:00;20 seconds;300' cigar,silver,10 windows w/soft corners, 200' off ground, traveling from ocean inland at less than 50 mph. I was traveling north to work at 5 am. or so and observed an object that I first thought was a 747 coming in to land at a local airport, but, it had no wings. It was traveling at less than 50 mph. The coast is dark at that point, and the city lights made the lower to upper areas visible. There were rectangular windows with rounded corners. A very light pinkish light shown in the windows. No markings. It traveled inland, east, for about 10 seconds and then made a slow (flat) 45 degree turn north and with a 20 degree rise flew another 10 seconds and then with an abrupt rise of 70 degree, increased speed and quickly disappeared into the night sky. If this object was infact an airplane or jet, I would have seen the tail section with a flat reflection, not, a cigar to oval end reflection. I viewed this object at approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile distance. I have been in construction all of my life and I know how to judge distance, shape, reflection, degrees, and travel speed. This object broke all the laws of physics. Did I mention, I stopped the car on the side of the road and opened the door and stepped out with one foot and listened for sound? There was no sound at all. None. No high tention line electrical type buzz, no jet like sound, no prop or motor noise, no nothing. I, of course, thought that it might be a blimp, but it was about 300' long, 30' high. This is not a cross section of any blimp I have ever seen of heard of. Besides, if this was an extraordinarly shaped blimp, why was there no motor or prop sound? Even a blimp makes a slight roll when it turns. The turn I observed was flat as a pancake. Also, I have never heard of a blime making a rise of 70 degrees, nor, pick up speed as rapidly as the object in question. If there is a logical explination for the occurance, I am all ears.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
