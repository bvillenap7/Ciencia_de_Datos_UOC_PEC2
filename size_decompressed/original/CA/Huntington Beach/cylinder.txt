Cylidrical object with bright white lights heading northeasterly from downtown Huntington Beach;2010-07-04 22:50:00;15 seconds;Cylidrical object with bright white lights heading northeasterly from downtown Huntington Beach At approximately 10:30 pm my brother went outside to the balcony to smoke a cigarette and I was speaking with my sisters inside my second story apartment.  I live very close to the beach in Huntington Beach and the fireworks display at the downtown pier had just finished at 9:30 pm.  My sisters and brother were waiting for traffic to subside before the departed home. About 10 seconds after my brother went to the balcony he yelled my name very loud to come outside now.  I proceeded outside to see what the commotion was about to see him pointing in an easterly direction at an object approximately 300 feet in the air at a distance approximately 3/4 to 1 mile away moving in a northerly direction.  The object was cylindrical with bright white lights on the entire exterior of the craft and a flashing red light at the top of the object.  It continued in a northerly direction for approximately 5 seconds when it banked to a easterly direction. When the object banked you could see the object was cylindrical in shape.  It continued in a easterly direction for 10 seconds until out of site due to the low cloud cover. My estimation of the size of the craft would be about 200 to 300 feet in length with a width of 75 feet to 100 feet in width.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
