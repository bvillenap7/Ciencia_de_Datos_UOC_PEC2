Still diamond shape craft in So. Cal. northern sky.;2001-07-17 21:45:00;3 hours;Still diamond shape craft in So. Cal. northern sky. Me and my mom were saying good-bye to a friend at around 9:45 at night.When I go out at night I always look up in the sky to see if I can see any stars or planets. That is kind of hard when you live pretty close to Los Angeles.On this night my mom and I looked up into the sky and saw a dimond shaped craft that was brighter than a star and not as bright as a planet. It was not moving and I am positive that it was not an air plane or helicopter because of the lack of noise. Me and my mom watched it for a few  minutes and then we went in. I looked out again at ten o'clock and it was still there.It also hadn't moved an inch from where it had been before. Then by chance I looked out the window into the Northern sky where it had always been. I was going to go to sleep so I just looked for a couple of seconds and when I was looking it suddenly vanished and I have never seen it again.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
