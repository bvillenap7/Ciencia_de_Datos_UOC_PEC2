String of lights travel across night sky in Huntington Beach Ca;2013-04-06 20:30:00;5-8 minutes;String of lights travel across night sky in Huntington Beach Ca I was sitting on back deck davenport island. looked towards the bridge that connects to mainland when I say a string of what appeared to be bright stars moving in formation heading parallel to warner ave but farther away. As I watched they continued to move then they even with palm trees directly across from where I was standing they began to form a cluster with two that remained to form a kind of tail.  The kept moving to my left and then I noticed a plane that was approaching and so continued to video but it was so dark that I doubt anything can be seen but my voice is clearly describing what i am seeing.  The gradually began to fade then disappeared from view. Really amazing I wonder if anyone else saw them?! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright light.  ((anonymous report))  ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.  PD))((anonymous report));2016-07-27 21:35:00;10 seconds;A circular object that had a bright light that seemed to float along the sky towards the East. No lights blinking at all and could still see it visible for miles as it glided or something.  It was rather creepy. ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.

5 solid red lights horizontal.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 21:20:00;20 seconds;5 solid red lights horizontal I was observing Venus when one single solid red light appeared in the sky.  I thought it was a plane or a helicopter but then another solid red light appeared right next to the first one, then another, for a total of 5.  They traveled across the sky going south along the coastline and diapered from my view.  There was no sound.  The lights were in a straight line, horizontal.  I tried to video but my phone did not capture the lights.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
