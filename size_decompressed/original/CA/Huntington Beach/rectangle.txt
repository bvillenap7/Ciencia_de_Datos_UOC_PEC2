I was heading north on Pacific Coast Highway, my friend and I saw red and green pulsing lights.  As we got closer I could see the silhouette of this object against the dimly lit clouds in the sky.  I turned around to be on the south side of Pacific Coast Highway so I would be closer.  On the north side of Pacific Coast Highway there was a highway patrol on the south side was a Huntington Beach police vehicle.  The officer was outside of his police vehicle with binoculars.  I pulled over and stopped.  I was going to get out when the lights that were pulsing alternately pulsed once simultaneously and were both red.  Then this object started to move slowly southeast down the beach.  I followed it slowly down to the Huntington Beach Cliffs.  Then it just disappeared.

3 rectangular light-colored objects observed while driving north on 405;2011-05-30 19:45:00;20 minutes;3 rectangular light-colored objects observed while driving north on 405 While driving north on the 405 freeway, I saw at least 3 relatively small (or at great distance) light colored horizontal rectangular shapes against a blue sky near dusk. These things were not particularly close together and no pattern or movement was observed. At the time I thought it looked almost like &quotholes&quot in the sky.  They appeared to be far away to the west and about 45 degrees above the horizon.  They did not seem to be related to nearby Los Alamitos NAS. They were not particularly close together with positions north, northwest and west relative to my position.  It was notable that each of these objects appeared to be the exact same size, shape and color.  The color was the same (or close to the same) as the clouds that were present.
