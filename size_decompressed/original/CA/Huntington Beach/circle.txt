Incident on Pacific Coast Highway leads to time loss;1977-08-22 00:00:00;3 - 4 minutes;Incident on Pacific Coast Highway leads to time loss My first husband and I were on Pacific Coast Highway taking a late night drive.   It was a week night, but neither of us had to work the next day so we caught a late movie and went for a drive.    We were on PCH directly in front of the Pier.   Everything on the pier was closed and there was no one else in sight.   Suddenly, an object appeared out of nowhere and began hovering over our vehicle.  There were several lights coming from the object that alternated between yellow, green, and red.  The object followed us down PCH.  The next thing we remember, we were on the 605 freeway heading towards Los Angeles, and it was a little after 3:00 a.m.   We are now divorced, but neither one of us ever spoke of this matter again.   I have had 3 other sitings:  1967, 1987, and 1997.  I feel there is some significance to the 10 year intervals.  I seldom speak of these incidents because family and friends don't believe me.  They think I was either dreaming or just saw an airplane. ((NUFORC Note:  The date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Round all silver circle with black dots on inner edges with two white lights near it;1991-06-15 12:00:00;15-20 minutes;Round all silver circle with black dots on inner edges with two white lights near it I was with a friend cleaning up my backyard from a party a day before.  We ate lunch in the backyard and I decided to lay on my back on the grass and my friend sat on a rock bench.   I was talking and looking at the clouds pass by and noticed a silver circle very high and motionless in the sky above my house.  It had what appeared to be black dots along the inside edges of the silver circle.  I don't think they were spinning but there was also two white objects next to it.   My friend saw it too.  I went into the house to get my binoculars, It was indeed, a silver circle or disk with black dots and the other objects we white lights that moved a couple times around the silver object below and in the clouds.   It was very neat, and I will never forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
A ball of light at a distance of approx. 1/2 to 1 mile moving at high speed with extremely exagerated lateral and vertical motions that;1999-08-15 21:45:00;5-10 seconds;A ball of light at a distance of approx. 1/2 to 1 mile moving at high speed with extremely exagerated lateral and vertical motions that disapeared out of sight very rapidly. Urban setting, there was a military (hard chopping) helicopter at lower than normal altitude moving at what seemed to be a odd and erratic flight pattern, that is what made me look up. The object was low on the horizon. As I write this now I can hear several loud aircraft in the background out my window. The object had no distinguishable characteristics other than being a ball of light, if I were to guess at the size of the object, I would say that it was probably the size of a large or medium sized helicopter. What caught my attention was the speed and VERY sudden accelerations and changes of trajecory that it made. I have seen many military craft flying at different altitudes and none of them ever approached this level of speed and directional change. At this moment I can see no less than 3 helicopters out my window. ((NUFORC Note:  Since the witness is close to the coast of the Pacific Ocean, he may have been looking to the east.  We are somewhat confused by the report, since it was submitted at 21:45 hrs. (Pacific) on 15AU99.  Hence, the event that the witness alludes to here could not have been the dramatic event that was to occur over New Mexico some 33 minutes later, at 23:18::10 hrs. (Mountain)  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  For video footage of the New Mexico event, captured by the Sandia National Laboratory sky camera in Albuquerque, please see the following URL:   http://www.cs.sandia.gov/SEL/apps/energy/meteor.htm   PD));33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393

Diagnol Upward Moving Star Like UFO's;2006-12-28 15:00:00;5 Minutes;Diagnol Upward Moving Star Like UFO's I was in my house and I looked out the window.  I saw this really bright star and I kept looking at it to remember if it was Venus or not.  All of a sudden it started to move in an upward diagnol way.  It made no sound.  There was some haze like stuff around it.  It had to be at least 10,000 fett in the air because I saw a plane pass by it 5 minutes before.  When it was almost out of my sight it went diagnolly down a little bit then shot off up again extremely fast, faster than a jet I have ever saw.  I was a little scared.  Then I saw another really bright star in the same location.  Then it started moving in a diagnol upward position again.  It followed the same procedure as the last one then shot off.  This happened three more times.  Then I got really freaked out so I went to my room.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
