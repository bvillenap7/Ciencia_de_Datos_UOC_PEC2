I was on my porch smoking and I noticed three egg shaped lights in the formation of a triangle flying very fast... My boyfriend and I were on the patio smoking.  he is the one that said  hey honey, look at that!.  I looked at it just as it was flying directly above my head.  As I stared at it, I tried to analys what it was.  It all happened quickly but my first view was three egg shaped lights moving together in the shape of a triangle.  I thought well It must be military jets in formation or somthing.  i thought that because they were at a very fast speed.  I didnt realize they were seperate until the two back end lights of the triangle seperated for about 2 seconds.  then I was tripping out.  Then it seemed to go up higher into the sky until it became small and we could not see it anymore.  My boyfriend and I looked at eachother and he pointed out two regular airplanes flying above us.   see, those are planes, those are flying much slower.  What the hell was that?  We then realized we can hear those planes flying.  we did not hear a sound when we saw that thing.  I dont believe in aliens but I can definately say it was some sort of ufo.  That's for sure.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393

While video taping a garden spider on July 22, spinning a web in my small apt. back yard, I witnessed a white oval shaped blur cross the sky traveling from south to north . As I ranted and raved about the object I had just seen to my elderly parents, my dad reminded me that my canon GL1 with a wide angle, may have captured the image. It did ! I have this object on video tape passing behind and over the spider building it's web.It is very crytic footage to say the least,and I'm sure it's got to be a one of a kind setting, that is, getting a spider and a U.F.O. together on video tape.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
