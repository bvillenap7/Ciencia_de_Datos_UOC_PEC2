It appeared to travel downward from my vantage point.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Orange orbs (Fireballs, Plasma Balls) seen on a continuing basis for three years over Huntington Beach, California.;2011-02-05 20:00:00;2-3 minutes;Orange Orbs (Fireballs, Plasma Balls) seen on a continuing basis for three years over Huntington Beach, California U.F.O.s over Huntington Beach   There has been an ongoing phenomenon in Huntington Beach, California, that has been happening for the past three years, and continues to this day.  Unexplained sightings of objects in the night sky, that have been witnessed by members of my family as well as friends and neighbors.  Let me say that in my almost 50 years, I have never seen these objects before in my life and neither has anyone else who witnessed them. The first such occurrence happened on the night of February 5, 2011, at around 9 p.m., I was alone and out walking our dog when I looked up and saw a bright orange object heading north from the ocean to about the center of the city.  From my vantage point, the object looked to be about 20 feet in diameter and was at an altitude of only 1000-1500 feet.  It was completely round and transparent like an orb and as if it were made of gas but also had an electrical component as the inside of it appeared to have a charge of some sort like lightning bolts within it.  The orange plasma ball moved very slowly at perhaps 20 m.p.h. across the sky for about two minutes total and then made a 90 degree angle and headed straight up slowly to a very high altitude until it could no longer be seen.  All the while it made no noise whatsoever.  I found this very curious as I have never seen anything such as this before. It wasnâ€™t a plane, balloon, drone or natural object and seemed to move  as if by! intelligent design. These sightings have occurred at least 12 times in the past three years of which I have personally witnessed 8 of them.  My family and friends told me about the others.  The latest event witnessed was on January 5, 2014.  The glowing balls show up every 2-4 months or so and perhaps more often if they are not seen by someone each time.  These orange balls of light have always appeared solely as one and not a cluster as some have witnessed in other areas.  They are always orange in color, appear in the evenings between 8p.m. and 11 p.m. and can travel from different directions (east to west, north to south, ect..), make turns and even hover over a spot.  My wife says she saw one stop and hover right above her for a minute as if it were watching her and then slowly went onward. I do not normally make a report on every small thing that I may see but the number and frequency of these objects compels me to report these sightings as they have become almost commonplace in our area and I hope it helps to find an explanation as to what these objects in our night sky are.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Red/White pulsating fireball, intelligently maneuvering in Huntington Beach sky.;2013-05-04 23:00:00;10 minutes;Red/White pulsating fireball, intelligently maneuvering in Huntington Beach sky. As I was driving home turning on to my street, I noticed what looked like a pulsating, changing fireball.  It would glow bright white, then change to red. It appeared to be maneuvering intelligently, and was very low in the sky.  I pulled over and filmed it for a little on my iphone, but was discouraged at the inability to zoom in on the object while filming.  Perhaps enhancement of the cell phone video will help.   The object appeared North East in the sky, and appeared to be making it's way higher into the low hanging clouds.   After I parked my car I was hoping to have the people I live with come out and see the object as well.  Much to my dismay it was no where to be seen.   Shortly after my sister, who was driving home at the time as well, and on a similar course, texted me saying she saw a fireball in the sky.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Red glowing fireball orbs w/plane coming head on for them disappear manuevered with intelligence.;2013-08-22 19:46:00;15 minutes;Red glowing fireball orbs w/plane coming head on for them disappear manuevered with intelligence I spotted them in the distance 3 LOW lights flying in perfect formation 3 large glowing orbs with 1 you could barely see out front that didn't light up but appeared to be a moving dot . 1st thought wow there are 3 stars as they approached us they would look red orange white the colors seeming to merge rather than change.  I could now see they were moving low and fast and were not stars nor were they attached to anything just than from the opposite direction  a low flying plane SESNA type coming low and were purposely coming head on w/ the light objects they were nearly above our heads when the second 1 (the 1 in the middle) w/ purpose got along side the 1st one they did this sort of bump into each other energy exchange I thought the plane was going to collide with them they were so close I braced for the worst grabbing my 2 sons ages 7 & 11 this was gonna crash right over our heads than into this air the they disappeared the one that did the bump the middle one! that pulled up to the first was the last to fade before he did he had a hole in the center like a donut before it disappeared my sons said they noticed us and they are spirits so says the children .;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Two fast orbs in Huntington Beach.;2014-04-24 21:39:00;2 minutes;Two fast orbs in Huntington Beach. The first object appeared from the south from a distance. It was glowing reddish-orange in color and circular in shape.  It did not flash or omit any other lights or colors showing it was a plane or helicopter.  It flew north, almost right above us, as it seemed to keep gaining altitude. When above us, the second object came into sight, from the south once again.  The color and shape was the same.  It as well flew straight north, gaining altitude as it went.  While watching the second object the first had vanished.  After the second object had gone far enough north to where we could see the back of the object, it faded out in similar fashion to a dying light. Both objects made absolutely no noise for how fast they seemed to be going.  Both flew in a linear path leaving no residue behind.  Neither of the objects diverted from the path they were taking.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
