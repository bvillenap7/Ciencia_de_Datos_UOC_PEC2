Cross shaped formation of lights dropping red flair light projectiles;2006-03-17 01:40:00;3 minutes;Cross shaped formation of lights dropping red flair light projectiles I saw an odd shaped cluster of lights as I drove thru a residentional neighborhood, so I stoppped the car and got out. It hovered at a distance moving in my direction, it literally  came right up to me. All I could see was the lights from underneeth. There were a total of sixteen lights in the shape of a cross, four lights on each leg of the cross with no light in the center. It floated towards me in a slow moving counter clockwise spin, and after hovering above it then reversed the spin into a clockwise motion and was traveling away from me and back over the neighborhood. I watched as it drifted away and saw red flair like pods being dropped from it's center, one after another, dropping a total of three before it dissapeared into the night.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393

ufo hides in clouds along with a secondary ufo in the same path.;2017-10-08 16:25:00;1 minute;ufo hides in clouds along with a secondary ufo in the same path. I was in Huntington Beach just about to park my car and have lunch. I was facing west towards the sunset.  I over heard a passenger airline jet cut and turn which made me just look up at the sky. no over cast just a few mid size clouds cruising by.  As I was looking up in a daze I noticed a quiet aircraft which seemed to look like a single engine cesna plane.  But the way it was flying and how high up it was didn't seem right.  As I excited my vehicle to get a better look at it. the ufo made a side ways move and went into a cloud and never came out of it.  the cloud was moving NW and the object was traveling NE.  it kind of looked like a satellite.  then briefly 1 minute after a smaller object came from the same distance and appeared to be smaller, but it could have been at a higher altitude.  it also went into a cloud and never came out.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
