Four Round Metallic Spheres in California;1990-08-08 12:00:00;30 minutes +;Four Round Metallic Spheres in California During my early twenties, I was with an acquaintance and we were taking a break (resting on our backs) from picking up some litter in my backyard.  I was talking about something and happened to notice four metallic ball or round like spheres very high in the sky just north east of my home.  I have 20/10 vision so I could make out that there was four.   One was in the center and it was larger than the other three.  The one in the center had black round dots in a circle around the bottom of it.  The other three were mainly metallic.   They stayed in one spot for over 30 minutes.  Together they formed a triangle shape formation.  They did not move or float away or get smaller like balloons often do.   But I did eventually lose sight of them after some clouds moved in.   That's it, it was very interesting.  Never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Sphere chased by Huntington Beach Helocopter;1997-10-12 18:30:00;20 seconds;Sphere chased by Huntington Beach Helocopter Myself and a friend were hosing off the sand from our wetsuits outside my house after surfing and noticed the usual buzzing of the H.B. copter only it was going really fast and obviously up to something.  We looked up and saw it in hot pursuit of a car sized bronze colored silent ball.  It was late afternoon almost dusk but you could see the sun still shining off of the sphere.  It was silent and swift as it was sort of zig-zagging around almost playing with the helo which had no chance.  It circled the electrical plant next to us and then took off heading inland accelerating out of sight with the helo following.  Both observers have extensive aviation backgrounds and one good vision and one with 20/17 vision. Also, a checklist was gone through TWICE just to confirm everything such as sound, markings, numbers...wings all of which was unexplainable. The scary thing is we know the govt. wouldn't be testing something that close to a pop. and very low maybe a few hundred feet or so.  Plus it just plain gave us the heeby-jeebies.  I personally never saw anything like it and was a sceptic.  Emphasis on WAS. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Police helicopter chasing sphere. ((NUFORC Note:  No date indicated by witness.  PD));2004-10-29 00:00:00;20 sec.;Police helicopter chasing sphere. After a surf we were hosing off outside and we heard the H.B. police helicopter buzzing above us wildly.It usually just cruises around but this time it was in a cat and mouse game with an object that was about the size of a car. I have perfect vision and a rather extensive background in aviation. We could make out all of the features of the copter but the object appeared to be like two clamshells together in a golden metallic color with possibly some blackish horizontal stripes. It was pulling off some fantastic manuevers that looked impossible! The chopper couldn't come close to it.  My hairs on my neck stood up and I felt that this is not of this world!It also had no lights and no sound. It was almost dusk outside.I yelled to my girlfriend to get the videocam but she was too late.  Also, there is an electric plant nearby and it flew around it twice before it shot off like a bullet with the copter in pursuit.I was a bit sceptical about this stuff until this happened, but now I know for sure something's going on here-if it was our govt., they wouldn't be testing something over houses!

clear  floating sphere w/flashing red and white lights.;2007-07-25 01:00:00;60 seconds;clear  floating sphere w/flashing red and white lights. As I walked to the back of the house with no lights on inside or outside looking out into the backyard through the slider glass door about 6 to 8 feet away from me there hovering slowly over our pool between the garauge wall and slider door (about 20ft distance between the two) there was a clear sphere the circumference of four feet with bright red and white strobe lights flashing from the inside.  As I got closer to the slider glass door to get a better look it floated slowly closer to the slider door and it seemed as if it noticed me and turned into a solid glowing green blue color with vien like black sploches. At this point I could not believe my eyes and scared I ran to the opposite side of the house to get someone else to see what I was seeing and as I looked back acrossed the house about 50ft away it was still floating in front of the slider glass door flashing the red light and in an instant it went up out of my view.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
White/Silver Object Over Huntington Beach, California;2009-01-31 13:10:00;20 Minutes;White/Silver Object Over Huntington Beach, California I saw this object over Westminster and Springdale streets in Huntington Beach, California.  I was removing a wasp nest from the eve of my house with a stream of water from a garden hose.  After I knocked it down and was spraying the wasps I looked up at the eve and saw this white/silver shimmering object staying stationary in the sky.  As I watched it, I saw it moving slowly left and right.  It did not seem to be affected by the wind.  The wind was out of the west maybe 5 mph. at ground level.  I went inside and grabbed my video camera.  It is really hard to film these things.  I got some of it on tape but Iâ€™m disappointed at my video.  At least I managed to capture something.  The white/silver thing moved back to the west, against the wind, hovering then moving again.  I called my wife out to look at it and my kids saw it too.  Unimpressed they went back into the house.  I watched and tried to get it on film for over 15 minutes, and then it just vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Three photos forwarded by witness.  We do not know what the object is, but our best guess is that it may be a cluster of helium-filled balloons.  PD));33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
The weather was partially cloudy (few clouds)I was at the parking place located at the east of the Huntington Beach library. I started;2011-02-20 15:20:00;8 minutes;The weather was partially cloudy (few clouds)I was at the parking place located at the east of the Huntington Beach library.  I started walking into the park (it surrounds the Library), I looked up towards the east and I noticed two bright spherical objects almost static, very high in the sky.  They were moving very slowly from East to West.  The two objects remained almost 6 minutes in the same position (straight up where I was).  They made no sound, but they looked like very shining stars(abnormally big).  The sun light was hitting them and probably it was increasing their luminosity or light reflection. As I looked around the objects, I realized that there was a third spherical object. This one was a little bit more towards the west than the other two, but still at relatively close distance from the pair straight above me.  The sunshine was making the view of this third object very difficult. I cannot tell how high or big they were, but I can tell with certainty that they were higher up then the commercial planes that  constantly fly this aerial corridor. The sighting lasted for approximately 8 minutes.  The objects quickly fade while moving towards the west, in the sun direction. The wind was blowing contrary to their heading direction. At that time, the prevalent wind was from West (Coast) to East(Mountains).  The whole incident lasted (at least from the time I first saw the objects) from 15:20 to 15:28. There were plenty of people at the park (despite the coldness of the wind), but the person nearest to me, at approximately 20 feet, was a man practicing skate boarding. He barely noticed me contemplating straight up into the sky, but he did not give any importance to my behavior. The Huntington Beach Police Helicopter arrived at approximately 15:27, and I could hear several sirens.  The helicopter was flying around the park very close from the location where I stood looking straight up to the objects. I do not know if there was an accident or not near by, but that is common event (at least in my experience)to have the Helicopter flying over the park.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Orange glowing balls moving together;2012-06-17 00:40:00;2-3 MINS;orange glowing balls moving together I was in the jacuzzi like every night, long beach pattern is right over me. All if a sudden I heard was sounded like a sonic boom. 15 secs after that, I was looking low over the horizon and noticed a bright orange light not moving low about 8-10 miles out over the ocean from me. Seal beach naval weapons station is right there.  What caught me attention the first light was not moving and hovering too low in the horizon to be normal traffic.  Then all of a sudden is travel quickly towards my location about 5 miles in with another one appear beside that one.  2 Orange glowing balls.  No flashing lights from a plane or anything, just orange balls. 30 secs after those two ball appeared another one appeared.  I quickly jump out of the jacazzi and ran for the video camera. they were almost two far away to get a clear shot.  Then another one came in higher than the other two.  Then all of a sudden one is just gone.  The 2nd one then dissapears, the third one climed higher in the sky but could still be seen for about 20-30 seconds. They looked like the moved back over the ocean.  These were not our normal airline traffic. Lights were too low, moved too fast, and the color is very unique orange. Plus no flashing lights like a helicopter.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Sphere like craft with very strong red light emitting from its tail sighted traveling southwest to northeast near the PCH.;2017-04-23 23:25:00;15 seconds;Sphere like craft with very strong red light emitting from its tail sighted traveling southwest to northeast near the PCH. I was sitting on my rooftop, smoking a cigarette in HB, Orange County, when I noticed a loud sound in the sky.  The sound was different from a helicopter and when I looked at the craft it was too low to be a plane.  The craft was emitting a very intense red light from its tail end.   When it passed over my head, I noticed a spear-shaped craft, but I could not see very clearly as it was dark out.  The craft appeared to be white, with some dark color intertwined on the bottom of it.   I told my friend to come out and witness what I saw.  When we looked at it about a minute after it had passed, we could very clearly see a very strong red light still emitting from the craft.  It was traveling southwest to northeast towards LAX.  But when we both looked at it again, it appeared to be hovering to the east.  I noticed other aircraft in the area due to me only being an hour from LAX and was paying attention to their lights and it was nowhere near as strong as the craft that I saw.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
Spotted bubble like object off the right side of the aircraft.;2020-06-11 13:46:00;30 sec;Spotted bubble like object off the right side of the aircraft. This in a summery of an event, of a unexplained flying object encounter on a flight between Anchorage and Hong Kong.  I was flying as a relief pilot sitting in the captains seat on a commercial cargo flight when I first spotted the object.  I immediately pointed the object out to the first officer who also saw it.  The Captain was in the back on his rest period. The location of the event was on an airway, R220, between NOGAL & NIPPI intersection, 21.4NM NE of NOGAL at FL400.  The coordinates were N4632.8/W15332.6. The closest land was 67.7NM off our right.  This land would be the Kuril Islands SW of the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia.  The only other know air traffic were two other aircraft that were on our TCAS.  They were on our route same direction of travel within 60NM ahead of us. It was daylight as the time was 1346 local (0346 Zulu). There was a low undercast layer of clouds, some towering clouds 100+ miles in the distance, but clear at our altitude. Our ground speed was 408 knots, true airspeed 476 knots, MACH # .830, wind 252/73 and total air temperature -20 something.  Our magnetic heading was 238Â°   While I was sitting looking at the first officer in conversation, I noticed a bubble like object off the right side of the aircraft.  I immediately pointed it out to the first officer.  He quickly grabbed his phone and tried to take several pictures of it.  Unfortunately due to bugs or dirt on the side windows, the camera focused in on the window instead of the unexplained object. The object looked like a clear sphere or bubble.  It appears to be rigged like glass or plastic, however I canâ€™t rule out a balloon.  The size is relative to the distance it was from our aircraft.  This is where the first officer and I have a difference in opinion. In the window, it was the size of pencil eraser.  I felt that the object was within a couple of hundred yards and was maybe the size of a car.  The first officer felt that it might have been more like a couple of miles away and therefore much larger.  The strangest thing about this object was that we didnâ€™t speed past it.  We did overtake this object but slowly.  We were moving over the ground at 408 knots into a nearly 70 knot headwind.  If the object was a balloon, I feel we wouldâ€™ve blown past it very fast.  So what ever this object was, it seems it was propelled by something.  There was no visible engines, exhaust or any thing else that resemble a know aircraft capable of traveling at such speed.   Needless to say, this consumer or conversation for the next several hours. When the captain returned to the flight deck, we explained our siting and continued to discuss what it could have possibly been.  The Captain was a previous F-18 pilot and both the first officer and I were civilian pilots.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
