Blue/Green Translucent Worm Over Huntington Beach;2009-01-31 13:35:00;20 Minutes;Blue/Green Translucent Worm Over Huntington Beach I saw this object over Westminster and Springdale streets in Huntington Beach, California. The white/silver thing had vanished so I put away my video camera and went back to my yard work. Then I saw the blue/green translucent worm. It was morphing and moving, these colors were like nothing I’ve ever seen. I went back inside and grabbed the video camera again. I managed to get some of this one on DV tape, but the colors are not as intense as watching it live. Again the wind was out of the west, and this object is moving against the wind to the west. I called my wife out so she could see it too. It would stay stationary for a while then it would go up or down in my sky and go east sometimes then west. This was a perfectly clear day, and after this one vanished after 20 minutes, I saw a strange black, two engine jet fly over where the two objects had both been.;33.6779111363639;-117.979388939393
4 shape shifting lights flies through the sky with planes and helicopters following it;2009-12-15 19:00:00;one minute;4 shape shifting lights flies through the sky with planes and helicopters following it So I was driving down the 405s freeway between beach blvd and Goldenwest Ave in Huntington Beach, CA at around 7pm and i saw an assortment of lights that were 4 distinct lights that formed the shape of an a-symmetric v with one light making one of the legs of the v while the other three light formed the other leg of the v. While at first i thought it was just a plane I kept watching it and saw the lights shift position in which the light kind of circled around each other and each light changed positions until it came around into a straight line. The unusual part was a few things, first, the four lights were not connected but if you focused in the lights you could see a faint light connecting all the lights together as if it were four lights on a string that would shift around as it moved through the sky. The second unusual part was that you could definitely see helicopters/airplanes following it like they were chasing it and as the helicopters/airplanes got closer the object would shift-shape and fly faster, i saw the object go from my left side of the car (north) to the front (east) to the right side (southwest) in less than a minute. Now it was not making any sounds that i could tell just the sounds of planes and helicopters.  The only reason that I would come to conclusion that this could be a ufo is that I had seen these same actions on two different tv shows at two different dates on the history channel in which these exact descriptions were portrayed four lights appearing to be shape shifting starting as a v then turning into a straight line kind of like Orion’s belt, but four lights, moving through the sky.  The other identifiable aircrafts were following it and having trouble keeping up. Again please let me know if there is another like story like this or if you know of aircrafts that do these kinds of actions thank you.
