This evening it was overcast and I couldn't see any stars.  As I was about to leave the window I saw a very large bright red flashing light, it wasn't like the usual airplane white light with smaller red one.   This flashing light soon became  a straight up and down line of red flashing lights.  I watched wonder what it could be,a satellite?   After watching it a few minutes it became  a triangle of flashing red lights, the same first column  in the same up and down position and the two other columns forming a triangle to the left.  It remained stationary for a minute and then slowly moved in a westerly direction.   I thought Oh Gosh that is a UFO, as I watched it slowly move to the left it was about to go out of my sight, I exclaimed out loud Oh no! come back this way.   To my amazement it started back toward the direction it had just come from, all the while the large red lights are continuing to flash.  It returned to the starting point where I had first observed the light and stood still for a time.  The triangle then started to move away from me and slowly disappeared in a north West direction.;39.2311;-121.149
