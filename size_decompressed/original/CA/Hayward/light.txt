Large bright red light hovers and shoots off before dropping smaller red/orange lights, one drops then moves at a right angle.;2002-01-15 20:48:00;2-5 minutes;Large bright red light hovers and shoots off before dropping smaller red/orange lights, one drops then moves at a right angle. Tuesday Jan 15, 2002 at 8:48 PM 45-48 degrees, dry, crisp and very clear dark nite. I am an amateur astronomer since 1973 and very familiar with not only the night sky but local air traffic and weather. Lights or objects sighted in Hayward, Ca, 15-25 degrees above the horizon looking east and my position is East of the Hayward Airport and west of the east bay foothills with Lawrence Livermore and Sandia on the other side about 50 miles. I had just got out of my car and removed an item from the trunk and as I turned looking up at the very clear starry night, looking east, with no traffic, and Gemini just right of my view above trees and power lines. I then noticed a very large bright red stationary light and quickly discounted Mars, a satellite, plane but not yet a helicopter. I assumed it was a helicopter at first by its apparent static movement but it slowly moved in circular pattern and then the light flickered and got dimmer/brighter. It appeared 10 times larger then any planet and many, many times brighter then Sirius in the winter. As I watched I noted the background stars (2 faint ones) and I moved away from the neighbors porch light and positioned myself with a better view. I moved around to see it pass behind the power lines and to get a different angle of view. I noticed when I stopped moving that it was making a slow circular motion in a small area. I continued watching and heard nothing and it started moving in a linear manner to the south. I then alerted my neighbor. He came out and observed it. I asked that he turn his porch light off and he stated it would take forever to turn back on but he turned it off anyway. We both continued observing it and then I stated, Stay here while I grab my binoculars. I quickly retrieved them and came out and started viewing it in a wide angle and saw that it seemed to have no shape other then seeming very broad. I zoomed in and still no shape, I zoomed out again and focused to see it better and followed it as it moved. I noted no other lights or surface. It seemed to have a sphere shape but more like a very large bright red orb or sphere shape. I handed the binoculars to my neighbor and he looked for 10-20 seconds. I regained the binoculars and spotted it quickly and as I did it dropped a light from the bottom (not as bright, and much smaller and slightly orange/red) which moved very quickly at a right angle to the bright red light. I stated loudly What was that?' and continu! ed follo wing it by eye and binoculars, it then dropped 4-5 more small bright reddish/orange lights that dropped quickly at a regular interval and they seemed to drop just over the hills or tree line. We both witnessed this. They seemed to be like flares shooting down with some sort of trail but they moved quickly, much faster than I would expect from a free fall. They were each slightly different in intensity/size and color. At this point the larger red light continued moving away and dimmed giving the impression of moving quickly away and out or dimming and moving away. I was watching with the naked eye at this point and could no longer locate the large red light nor the multiple smaller lights. I heard no sirens after and no other witnesses. My neighbor returned to his apartment and I sat at my computer recollecting any and all details. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally lucid and credible.

UFO in Hayward, CA , more activity seen within last couple of days by others.;2003-05-23 22:00:00;3 min;UFO in Hayward, CA , more activity seen within last couple of days by others. There is a lot of air traffic just to the south of where I live. It was warm outside so I decided to go out and look at the stars. Light pollution was fairly low and the moon wasn't out. From the east a light travelling much slower than the air traffic came over the ridge and made movements that were not consistant with commercial airliners or helicopters. There where no blinking lights, no sound, and I couldn't identify any solidity due to the intensity of the orange light. I took pictures with a disposable camera which show the light and also a commercial airliner in the same frame. I hope they turn out. I tried to call a friend to come look out of their house but my cell phone made a weird noise then cut out. I later went inside and called, it worked fine. I talked to the same friend and they said that a lot of sightings have been in the area latey and some during broad daylight. He also said, it's a wonder the press isn't doing more to address it. But you know. I looked on your site to see if anyone else had seen the same thing but it looks like updates take a while. I hope the film I have turns out.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
Bright light drops other bright light.;2003-10-04 23:00:00;2-min-3-min;Bright light drops other bright light. Tonight(10/4/03) around 10:45 pm i was hanging out with a few freind's,we were outside on the third floor balcony of my freind's apartment,when i noticed a amber colored light flickering in the distance,it didn't seem to be an airplane or any other type of normal light,i brought it to everyone's attention and as we watched it it slowly drifted in our direction,it was slightly cloudy so we could clearly see it was under the cloud's.It then moved to an area of the sky where the cloud's were parting and then it just seemed to turn off,disappear right before our eye's!We all thought it was very strange.Then about 11:30pm i saw the strange amber light in the distance again!It was traveling along the same trajectory as the first one(not sure if it was the same one?)it traveled as slow as the previous light,same amber color,this time the light seemed to pause/stop momentarily along the way it did this twice before it stopped!!When it came to a halt this strange light seemed to drop another light from it,it fell very fast then dimmed out!Then suddenly the amber light moved slightly upward then vanished like the previous sighting.We all were shocked by this,some of the people there have never seen anything like this before,so you could imagine the reaction's.Needless to say this remained the topic for the rest of the evening.What was it?Your guess is as good as mine....  http://emfx13.proboards17.com/index.cgi?board=cats&action=display&num=1065350632;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967

I didn't see a solid object, but I saw some crazy lights!;2003-11-28 00:00:00;5 minutes;I didn't see a solid object, but I saw some crazy lights! I was driving north on highway 880 from Thornton ave. My wife and I noticed what appeared to be a cluster of blinking lights or airplanes. We seemed to be getting closer and then noticed that is was only one object not few as we originally thought. It appeared to be bouncing in the sky going up and down unusually fast. Then it flew across the horizon at incredible speed, and it looked like a smaller object was following. Then it flew in front of us and remainded there for another minute or so. When I was directly in front of us we noticed that the lights appeared to be spinning and and not blinking.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967

Lights above Hayward, CA;2004-10-05 13:35:00;10 minutes;Lights above Hayward, CA I was sitting back on some warm brickwork getting some sun between classes up at the University. The sky was crystal clear, blue, slight breeze, warm, and we had the usual panoramic view of the Bay Area. We normally have a lot air traffic coming over the hill. This was nothing like that, especially since the altitude was so high. 3 white lights were in a triangular pattern, spaced a distance apart, and were pretty high up there. It was like seeing the North star during the day x3. One was especially bright and the other two were just a little dimmer. They stayed static for a few minutes then one zoomed off, looking like a meteor but left no trail. A second dimmed and took off. The third one zig zagged a little, may have come down a distance since it got a little brighter, and then vanished like it was sucked away. I've asked a few other people I know if they've seen things like this around here. They've said yes but usually at night or early evening. I read some of the other reports and tend to believe something special is happening around here. I wonder if it has anything to do with the Earthquake activity in the area and a little south? I know from some reading that the ground 'sings' when we have a tremor. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
SF was dark, bright light split into two lights, both travel off in opposite directions, both disapear at different times.;2007-10-20 20:00:00;3 minutes;SF was dark, bright light split into two lights, both travel off in opposite directions, both disapear at different times. Walking out the door to go meet my wife, I spied an unusual bright light in the sky. I am very familiar with the night sky here, and the normal forms of air traffic, and I instictivly knew this was out of the ordinary. 15 seconds into the sighting, the bright light split into two separate lights, one moving off in an approximate south bound direction, and the other moving in an approximate north bound direction. The speeds seemed very slow, almost as if they were sattelites, but they were definelty at a lower altitude. The north bound light disapeared suddenly at about 1 minute into the sighting. At this time, I broght the south bound object to my wifes attention, and we both observed this light traveling across the sky slowly. It was traveling in our general direction. At about three minutes into the sighting, the object was observed to dim greatly in an instant, but was still observable. It then was observed that the object appeared to move straight up, and instantly disapeard. This was no normal sky traffic, and to top it off, it all happend at the same time that San Francisco went dark for their annual Lights Out San Fransico event, where much of the city's lights went dark for one hour. This sighting left us shook up, and slightly frightend.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
STARS RE ARRANGING AND LIGHTS FALLING FROM THE HEAVENS.;2011-05-19 02:11:00;2-3MINUTES;STARS RE ARRANGING AND LIGHTS FALLING FROM THE HEAVENS. EXITING FREEWAY AND SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE TWO LARGER THAN NORMAL STARS WITH A REDISH GLOW TO THEM.   I TURNED THE CORNER AND ROLLED MY WINDOW DOWN TO GET A BETTER LOOK AND NOTICED THE LIGHTS STARTING TO MOVE TOWARDS EACH OTHER VERY GRADUALLY.  I WOKE UP MY PASSENGER AND THEN PARKED THE CAR AND GOT OUT.  WHAT I SAW NEXT WAS ASTONISHING I SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE A SPEC OF LIGHT THEN FALL FROM THE GLOWING LIGHT ON THE LEFT AND THEN DISAPPEAR (AS IN I DIDN'T SEE IT FALL ALL THE WAY TO THE GROUND BUT IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FALLING)   AS I LOST SIGHT OF THE FALLING LIGHT, THE LIGHT TO THE RIGHT OF THE LIGHT IT FELL FROM DISAPPEARED,  THEN THE LIGHT REMAINING SPLIT INTO TWO LIGHTS AND THEN DISAPPEARED  ALTOGETHER! I WAS LOOKING TOWARDS THE (S) EAST WHEN I SAW WHAT I SAW.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
Bright White Circular light object high in the sky.;2012-09-09 13:00:00;appear of and on for a co;Bright White Circular light object high in the sky. After a plane seemed to spray what looked like 3 to 4 lines of a white chemical that seem to disappear as soon as it was sprayed, a Bright round light appeared very close to the airplane for a couple of seconds. It would appear and disappear.  Moving only a short distance. This occurred about 4-5 times. As soon as this  bright light would disappear we could see tiny bright lights floating around right in front of our eyes. I thought I was imagining these tiny specs of floating light until the other 2 observers told me they saw them as well.  The sky seemed to be getting  a hint of a smokey color.  After this happened about 3 more aircrafts were above the sky spraying behind them.  Each of them spraying 4 white lines of a cloudy substance that disappeared after being sprayed.

High flying craft, multicolor with immediate impossible direction change.;2013-12-25 19:08:00;2 minutese;High flying craft, multicolor with immediate impossible direction change. High flying craft, looked like a star at first.  It was moving in a South East direction.  It was a solid bright white light when it started moving.  As it began to increase speed it faded to an orange and then red before changing direction to a easterly heading. The direction change was immediate, unlike a plane which must bank to turn.  This thing was going one way and then bang went the other direction before blinking out.  It was very shocking.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
