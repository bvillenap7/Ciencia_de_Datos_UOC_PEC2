Many different colored glowing  objects;1999-10-10 20:35:00;60-90 sec;Many different colored glowing  objects My brother called to me to come outside . Upon exiting our residence  he told me to look toward the sky as hed seen a UFO . I looked up and watched two small lighted objects move slowly across the sky. I estimatew thier altitude to be above 40,000 feet. We then observed three objects in a triangle formation  all of which were different colors and glowing. These three objects moved as if they were being dropped by parachute. The other objects moved about the same area. Then three or four other lighted objects appeared in the same general area. The whole time lasted approxiametly 60- 90 seconds.Fortunately my brother was able to get his digital camera out to film these observations . It may be possible that this was military aircraft, but the observation of the glowing of the objects sent chills through my body.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967

My kids and I witnessed a round black object in the sky, that moved drastically at night with unbelievable disbelief.;2002-06-13 22:15:00;5 or 10 min.;My kids and I witnessed a round black object in the sky, that moved drastically at night with unbelievable disbelief. On June 13th 2002 at about 9:15pm, my wife was at work and the kids and I went into our new hot tub.While they played a game my daugter noticed an object in the sky which my kids debated over.At first I was out of view from the patio overhang,when my son asked me to take a look.We were all stunned and silent for a moment watching it sit motionless.I remembered a video camera sitting on the kitchen table,so I made a run for it.After jumping back in,I filmed this object darting back and forth.It appeared black but gave out flashes like a strobe,going in and out of unusualy thick cloud cover.As if it was trying to avoid the camera following it.This lasted a few minutes while I tried to focus,catching some of these images.My kids were very scared at this point,while I assured them it finally dissapeared.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967

Formation of white lights circling in Hayward skies on Nov. 12, 2006;2006-11-12 20:00:00;2 hrs;Formation of white lights circling in Hayward skies on Nov. 12, 2006 My wife and I observed a formation of 5-6 circular lights circling over our house in heavy cloud cover over Hayward, CA for over 2 hours last night. Two stationery, white circular lights were also observed hovering nearby. We called a neighbor and he also observed the strange lights that eventually moved north, but we could still see them circling the sky for over 2 hours. There were no indications of ground lights beaming upwards into the sky, and there were no mechanical noises of helicopters or other aircraft heard. I took video footage of the formation, but due to the sky being very dark, I couldn't tell whether my video camera was picking up the circling lights. I will send the video clip within the next couple of days if usable. I need to upload to my computer to see whether the footage was caught.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967

Strange lights hovering over Highway 880;2015-08-05 21:30:00;2 minutes;Strange lights hovering over Highway 880 We were headed Northbound on Highway 880 at around 930pm on September 5, 2015 as I noticed about 8-10 strange lights in a zig zag formation in the sky as we approached the Winton exit.  The lowest object was about 50 feet above the fence line and they were evenly spaced about 50 feet above one another.  The strange lights were just hovering there with no movement and were circular colored orbs with no sound.  (I thought someone was doing fireworks). As we continued to drive Northbound I could see the lights in the distance still in the sky as I looked back.  There was heavy traffic being a Saturday night so I know we were not the only ones who saw this spectacular event.  We decided to exit the freeway to turn back around to see more but and the lights had disappeared in less than five minutes.  I am so disappointed I was too excited to grab my camera because it was definitely something out of this world.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
