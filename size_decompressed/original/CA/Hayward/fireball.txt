The objects i observed at night were spherical and moving up and down never side to side ,the 5 objects after 2 min. came to a complete stop then began to lobbgreen embrioniclooking fireballs.The fireballs were slightly transperent with aslight yellowish interior.Me personoly in the past have never seen a u.f.o but had some intrest in them.I consider myself to be very rational and never jump to conclusions to quikly.   AND I ABSOLUTLY IN THE PAST OR PRESENT NEVER WOULD MAKE UP A STORY EVEN CLOSE TO THIS . I have a sense of humor but this is'nt funny at all!;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
Fast, bright and low flying UFO seen over Hayward, CA.;2002-03-19 19:32:00;2 sec.;Fast, bright and low flying UFO seen over Hayward, CA. I was looking in the clear dark sky when I suddenly and accidentely saw an object which I can not explain. The object was shining bright in a white color and it moved westbound towards the Bay of San Francisco. The object was flying very fast. Much faster than any plane at this altitude and it didn't make any sound at all. I guess the object was about 500 hundred feet above ground level. Although I saw it just for about 2 sec. I can tell for sure that I have never seen such a thing before in my life. I am absolutely sure that it was not a airplane, altough there is much air traffic in this area. The object had a similar shape like a comet when entering the atmosphere, but it flew too low and it was too big to be considered as a comet.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
