low altitude flourescent light;2005-10-13 21:30:00;15 seconds;low altitude flourescent light I was walking to the garbage bin at the apartment complex where my friend lives. I looked up to the sky facing the west.   When I thought a low flying small airplane was heading towards the Hayward Aiport which was roughly 5 miles from where my friend lives.  It was rectanglar in shape and was lighted like a white flourescent light bulb.  It made no noise whatsover.  It glided on a downward slope as if it was hugging the terrain, and then disappeared into thin air.  I realized it wasn't a plane when it made a dip as it descended and no other lights were visible, it seemed to be like a flying flourescent piece of white plastic.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
