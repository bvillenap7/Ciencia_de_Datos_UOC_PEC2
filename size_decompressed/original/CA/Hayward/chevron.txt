Clear night, just a few scattered clouds, but otherwise starry.  Looked up. Saw a stealth bomber shaped object coming my direction from the northeast and flying southwest.  It appeared to be flying really low, maybe 300-500 ft.  It appeared to be probably 15-25 ft or maybe a little larger wing tip to wing tip. It was COMPLETELY silent. Black or dark grey in color. The strangest thing was that around its edges it appeared to reflect some sort of light, but didn't look to be emitting light itself, at least not like a plane does.  Then just OFF the edge of the craft the sky seemed to &quotdistort&quot a little like sound waves. This distortion was odd, sort of like it was bad special effects for &quotcloaking&quot that looked like sound waves.  The distortion was just around the edges of the object but not on the object itself.  On the edge of the object itself, right around the edges of the whole obj! ect, it seemed to reflect light, if that makes sense, but not emit light.  Odd. When I saw it I was shocked, I felt compelled to blink and shake my head a little to make sure I was actually seeing what I was seeing, which I was.  It was flying maybe 60 miles an hour or something like that, again absolutely quiet and in a straight line.  It flew out of site because of the tree line and it was gone.  I know it wasn't a bird or anything else. It was a craft of some sort. I'm thinking it was a military drone or other stealth aircraft from the government. I live in a populated area. The East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area, so I know other people had to have seen it also.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
