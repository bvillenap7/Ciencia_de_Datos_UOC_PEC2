I noticed a bright bright light up in the sky I watched it and wondered what it was cause it was moving towards me,I thought it might be a plane but it was hovering then it would fly than it hoverd,  by that time it was really close  and I thought its so quite theres know noise not at all then I looked at my dogs and they were looking up at it also it was right above us and all I could see four bright lights and a huge red pusluating light in the center my estimatation it was as long as a football field it was just hovering there in the sky going over my house.I watched  it move away till it was know longer in sight then I ran in the house and noted the time it was 6:08am.
