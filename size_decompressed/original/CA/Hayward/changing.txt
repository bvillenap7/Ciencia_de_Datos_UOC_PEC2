3 seperate sightings in one night;2015-09-18 20:00:00;1+ hours;3 seperate sightings in one night A line of 3 colored lights (green, blue, and red) traveling south in a vertical formation, changed into a triangle shape (still traveling south) followed by 4 sets of two vertical white lights.  The collection spread out, changed from lines and triangles and into an almost  snakelike shape slithering across the sky, the lights flowed together as one massive looking spineless serpant slithering left and right across the sky.  The space inbetween the lights were darker than the sky and made the stars it passed over shaded or not as bright.  The lights turned east and all of the colored lights turned white and spread into different directions.  Less than 5 minutes later, another 3 vertical lights (red, green, and white) (moving much slower than the first set) shifted into a triangular shape heading south.  The shape looked like it started sputtering, then turned onto it's side.  I could then see it wasn't just a flat object there was a distinct thickness to it.  It stayed sideways for about 45 seconds then flipped back and 2 of the lights went out.  The last light went out as the object flew between 2 stars and disappeared.  The last object i saw was circular, traveling north, the front of it was covered in multiple different colored flashing lights with no lights visible on the base.  As the object flew over me, it turned face down with the multicoloured flashing lights staring down at me. I could see layers of different colors flashing in front of and behind one another.  Once the object passed me the front faced back up and North.  Again no lights visible from the bottom.  No lights visible from the back until the object was 1 maybe 2 miles away.  There were 2 orange lights, one on the left and one in the right.  Throughout this whole experience there was no sound made by any of the lights or objects I saw.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
