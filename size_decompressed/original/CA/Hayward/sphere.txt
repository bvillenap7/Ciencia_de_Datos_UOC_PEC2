More UFO's in Hayward;2004-10-12 14:00:00;45 Minutes;More UFO's in Hayward I reported a sighting about these same craft last week. It happened again but only there were more craft and one of them actually 'buzzed' the University at a high rate of speed.(It went between Warren and Micklejohn Halls then over to the hills. From what I could tell it probably didn't land but it only took a few seconds for it to dissapear. There were quite a few witnesses. Everyone kind of looked at each other then went off to do what they needed to do. The sky was clear no real breeze. No special noise or funny feelings, etc. There were the same craft up high like the last time but many more, sometimes single simetimes in pairs. They seemed to change altitute and direction alot. Most of the craft seemed to head east. There was a high altitude jetliner passing fairly close to one at one point. Normal air traffic that comes over the hill is pretty low, they stack a little to the south and east of the Campus. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We would like to other witnesses to submit reports, as well, in order to corroborate the report above.  PD));37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967

6 Revolving Spheres over Hayward Calif.;2007-03-12 20:09:00;1 minute;6 Revolving Spheres over Hayward Calif. I was standing outside looking up at the sky. It was 8:09pm. The UFO was very low,about 100 feet above. It was 6 spheres about 3 to 5 feet in diameter.They were blue/grey in color with silver tracing running on the outside. These spheres were inline with each other,like touching each other but in a straight line,and were all spinning in different directions. The speed was about 5 miles an hour.There was no sound of propulsion. I saw it for about one minute, then walked out front and saw it passing Hayward City Hall,it continued North.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967

For some reason, I don't know why there appeared to be a commotion in the sky and my eyes just naturally focused in on the area. All of a sudden, out of nowhere I was looking at an object that I have never seen before.  It appeared to be a miniture moon with a collar around it.  It was pink and red in color and it was low, probably less than 8,000 feet.  The body of the craft appeared to be irregular as far as the texture. It appeared to be pink and some parts red like what the moon would look like if it was going the speed of light.  The collar around it looked like it was manufactured and almost appeared to be opaque with a red outline. This thing was there for only a split second and was gone.  The craft moved so fast that it appeared to dissapear.  However there was a very short, bright trail of sparks in the sky when it left. Okay, now for the real kick, did you ever recall looking skyward and seeing these short burst of sparks and saying, wow, I just saw a shooting star.  You know what, its not a star its them. Nowdays if you look skyward at night for any length of time you'll see these trails of sparks often enough.  Never use to but now we do.  I had made an attempt to bring this to someones attention but instead I spoke to what can only be called the smartest person in the world because this individual didn't want to hear anyone but himself talk.

3 bright orange lights appear and disappear in succession.;2013-02-10 00:00:00;5 minutes;3 bright orange lights appear and disappear in succession. Saw a bright orange light that appeared to go left to right in a slow and deliberate trajectory and disappeared.  Another appeared from the West direction it was about 45 degrees southeast from Orionâ€™s Belt.  It descended vertically and then disappeared.  A final bright and orange sphere followed the same trajectory as the first orange light but disappeared halfway.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
