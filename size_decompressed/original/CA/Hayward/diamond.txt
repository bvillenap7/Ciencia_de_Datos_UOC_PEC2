Blue and White lights over Castro Valley and Hayward California;2002-06-04 23:00:00;5:00;Blue and White lights over Castro Valley and Hayward California While driving on highway 580W I saw a huge formation of lights over the hills near the highway.  4 huge blue lights in the shape of a diamond and 2 small white lights way out to the sides, one white light on either side of the blue lights.  They were motionless and hanging in the air space above the hills.  I heard no noise nor did I see what the lights were attached too.  I continued home and as I exited highway 880S at Tennyson I drove under the overpass onto a loop to get onto Tennyson East I saw the same light formation in the distance towards the Bay.  Neither noise nor motion.  The lights were bright but didn't seem to illuminate with a beam forward from the light.  I called the Hayward Airport which would have been near where the lights were and they said they didn't see anything.  I also called the newspaper to find out if anyone else had reported seeing the lights and was told no.  I even left a message with the air traffic control office, but never! heard back from them.  I researched where I could report this, but wasn't able to find a reputable agency.  I forgot about what I had seen until I just watched a UFO show on TV.  I honestly do not remember the date at all.  The time was about right because I wanted to stop and look at the lights, but I had work the next day and needed to get home. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
