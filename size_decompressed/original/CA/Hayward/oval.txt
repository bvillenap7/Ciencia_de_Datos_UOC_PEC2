4 bright oval-shaped white objects hovering over my house in Hayward, CA.;2001-09-26 20:45:00;20 minutes;4 bright oval-shaped white objects hovering over my house in Hayward, CA. I and two other wittnesses saw 4 very, very bright white oval-shaped lights from our window during a lightning storm.  Every six seconds they would pulse to form one light in the middle and then go back to their four positions (square shape.) They seemed very low in the sky or else they were extremely large. I caught some interesting pictures. The lightning was flashing horizontally in the far background, the lights were directly over my yard and the neighbor's yard, when the lightning reached out like a pitchfork twice straight towards my window and these 4 objects.  It was like something out of a movie! I have been wondering about what the heck this was for a year now. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We suspect that advertising lights would have to be ruled out before it could be concluded that the objects were UFO-related.  PD));37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
Oval object with a rotating tethered object in the middle, observerd Oval blow up;2004-05-03 05:57:00;5 minutes;Oval object with a rotating tethered object in the middle, observerd Oval blow up This is for the record on May 3rd 2004 at approx. 5:57 AM daylight savings time in Hayward Ca. looking south almost straight up I saw a bright light, it appeared like Venus so I pointed my telescope at the light using the low power finder and I then looked in the main telescope eyepiece and ... it was nothing I had ever seen in the past 5 years of observing or ever in my life. The object was oval in shape (grayish almost transparent) with 2 dots evenly spaced half way from the outer edge of the oval (1 on either side of the oval) think of a lady bug, then at the center of the oval there was a tethered object rotating around the oval in perfect symmetry (between the 2 dots). It looked like a string with an object connected at the end and it was rotating around the center the oval in the direction it was traveling. Almost as if it was the propelling force that caused the oval to move. Think of pedaling a bicycle. I observed it for about 10 seconds and looked back up in the sky and it was bright. Now being sure I could find it again I ran inside to get a witness. It was almost 6 AM and I pulled my sleeping son out of bed and aligned the object again in the telescope and his comment was what is that? I've shown him may astronomy objects such as nebulas, star clusters, and most of the big planets so this was also new to his eyes also. Now 2 minutes at the most passed as I tried to get a camera up and running but no luck and the object was moving overhead so I looked again through the telescope and just at that point ... the oval blew up. The explosion looked like a firework that just went off in the sky. What was observed next was unexpected ... the tethered object in the middle separated intact and continued to rotate. So what I saw was an explosion the tethered object separate and the rotation continued (only now end over end instead of rotating around the oval). And now instead of moving overhead the tethered object is starting to move downward. (My hand tracking of the telescope now has me moving the telescope down instead of > up and over as with the original path the oval was moving which was south to north. The tethered object now had 2 distinct ends one was the pivot end and the other was the original object that was rotating around the oval. So the rotation stayed the same but now moving downward as if falling from the sky and rotating around a new pivot. The new pivot point is now interesting as it now takes shape and color. It appears like an elongated cone, orange in color and it appears as if there are 2 strings coming from the cone to the tethered object rotating around this orange cone. The strings seem to come together as one, half way down the length of the tether. I watched this for about 1 to 2 minutes and even tried a higher power eyepiece but due to the narrow field of view of the higher power eyepiece I only saw it briefly and subsequently lost track of the tethered object. The orange color was more evident at the higher power and the 2 strings appeared more evident. The telescope used was a Meade 8 Newtonian on an equatorial mount,ironically the mirror was just cleaned the day before so it was perfect and the only reason I was still out at 6 AM (the Sun was rising and ruining the star gazing) was the tracking motor was malfunctioning and I wanted to test the tracking on any bright object I could find before total Sun rise washed out even the brightest of stars and I would have to wait till night fall to test again. The weather condition was clear with good transparency (no haze)and the temperature was in the high 50 degrees F.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
Unknown Red Oval in the sky over the San Francisco Bay Area;2008-01-24 18:10:00;3 minutes;Unknown Red Oval in the sky over the San Francisco Bay Area Red Oval shape with orange circler lighting circling around the oval moving at slow pace from San Francisco to San Jose. Before it went out behind the clouds, the red oval grew to a bright red and zipped off behind the rain clouds.  I need to know if anyone else saw this, and was it what I thought it was?;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
I was looking out my kitchen window looking at the sky as i washed dishes and i saw a light i thought it was a plain until it got close;2014-01-28 01:15:00;1 minute;I was looking out my kitchen window looking at the sky as i washed dishes and i saw a light i thought it was a plain until it got closer towards my direction, it was moving slowly and i caught my attention i started and saw lights going across the middle of the oval shape ufo the lights were blue and red,  i washed it accross the window and as soon as the view of the ufo pased over my house i ran to the back window to cheque if it realy was a ufo or i was wrong by geting another view, but i didnt see it no more it was gone.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
