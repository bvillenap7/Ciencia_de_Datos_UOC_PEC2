Trianglular object;2003-11-09 21:00:00;30-sec.;Trianglular object last night i was checking out the eclipse,(few cloud's here and there),when i saw a shadow like object that at first kind of resembled a plane,then it moved into the illumination of the moon and i saw i triangular shape to it.It was moving a pretty good pace,i really couldn't tell you exactly how fast it was going?The size of it from where i was standing in my drive way,i'd was about the size of an eraser on the end of a pencil if you were to hold it at arm's length.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967

A triangle craft with five glowing circles passes in front of Jupiter.;2005-04-14 22:00:00;20 seconds;A triangle craft with five glowing circles passes in front of Jupiter. It was 10 pm, my wife was outside under our patio smoking a cigarette.  I don't smoke but like to go outside and look at the stars when she's smoking.   I was looking at Jupiter, which was almost directly south, when I see five glowing circles cross right across Jupiter travelling North.  The glows weren't lights like on a airplane but circle shapes that glowed they glowed dim, real dim.  There were five glowing circles that were underneath a triangle shape one was in front and two on either side.  The glowing circles were in a chevron shape but the whole craft was a triangle.   When I first noticed it I called my wife over to see it.  Neither of us had any idea what it was, it was not an airplane and it had no sound, no sound at all.  It went across all the sky we could see in about 20 seconds, at least three times faster than an airplane.  We thought it could've been the stealth bomber but we didn't think even that could go that fast.  My wife is a computer programmer and I an animator we are both intelligent well-educated people.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
I saw a perfect triangle with lights at each point;2009-08-29 00:10:00;15 seconds;I saw a perfect triangle with lights at each point At around ten minutes after mid-night on 8/29/09 my son and I saw a UFO.  My 12 year old son, 5 year old son and I had just returned from the grocery store, Safeway.  It was a hot day today and an unusually hot night.  I backed my truck into my drive way and started to get out.  My truck was facing East.   I turned to the left/North to get out of the truck and I looked up at the sky.  I was staring at the stars and saw what I thought was a bird but as I kept looking at this object I noticed it was a triangle.  I shouted, Oh My God, at this point my 12 yr old son shouted its a UFO.   We both watched it go toward the San Mateo Bridge which would be West.  We both stared at this object until we could no longer see it.   The object was what a perfect triangle with lights at each point.  It was silent and moved very fast. I was shocked and speechless.   My son and I came into the house and went into two different rooms to draw what we.  Without telling the other person what we were ! going to draw.  We exchanged drawings and both drew the exact thing.   Unbelievable.  I was always suspisious of persons claiming to of seen UFO's, but not anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the mother, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere, and sober-minded.  PD));37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
Semi-transparent triangle shaped low and slow object;2016-02-14 19:40:00;10-15 seconds;Semi transparent triangle shaped low and slow object I was standing on my back porch enjoying the night sky.  I was looking up to my right at the near half moon.  When I turned my head forward I noticed what looked like 5 or so helium balloons tied together, floating across the sky.  They appeared to be dark in color gray or black but floating across the sky instead of up.  They were moving the speed of helium balloons but stayed in a perfect triangle formation.  It looked led as if I could only see a faint reflection of the neighborhood lights in them. I walked down the steps as the object passed and when I got to the bottom saw the object from the back and it looked like a stealth bomber shape with less jagged edges at the back. It was silent and somewhat transparent (if that makes any sense.) as I took a step closer to try and see better I blinked and it was gone.  There's no way it was moving fast enough to be out of sight in a blink. The object was flying low.  Not much over the rooftops and was no wider than a car is long and completely silent. Nothing I can think of even comes close to explaining what I saw.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
3 Triangle Objects Changing Colors Directly Over San Francisco.

We have 3 Videos Approx 15 Minutes of Video Captured. My wife and I witnessed 3 separate identical objects Sunday 3/22/2020 approximately 22:45 to 23:15 directly above San Francisco, Ca. 1 of the 3 objects stayed stationary the entire time and did not move while the other 2 slowly glided across the sky north to south and south to north crossing their paths above the stationary object.  We have 3 separate cell phone videos containing about 15 minutes of footage using Samsung S10+ cameras. After about 30 minutes all 3 objects including the stationary object slowly headed out towards the open ocean due West to the Pacific Ocean.  We would love to know what it was we witnessed.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
