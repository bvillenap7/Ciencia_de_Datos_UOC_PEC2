It was about 21:00 and there was a full moon.  The UFO was seen in the west and toward in a southwesterly direction.  Several witnesses saw lights around the perimeter - I could only see that it appeared to be backlit.  The night had been cloudy but was clear when the object was seen.  As it moved to the south, it disappeared behind/into a cloud and was not seen again.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
