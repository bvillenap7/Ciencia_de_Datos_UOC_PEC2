It was not going that fast and it did not make any type of sound. I thought maybe itâ€™s a plane and I just have not seen its wings yet or something was hiding its wings because it might be to high, but then I looked toward the southern sky and there was a commercial airplane flying at about the same altitude as this object and I noticed everything about that Airplane. So if these two things were flying away from each other at the same altitude then I knew this was no airplane. So I looked back at the Cigar like object and figured it must not have wings. So I kept looking at the object until it flew out of sight.;37.6558635245902;-122.081370081967
