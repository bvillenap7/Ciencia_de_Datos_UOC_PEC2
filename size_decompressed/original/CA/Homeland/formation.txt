At least 15 identical lights heading N/E on the same trajectory.   ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-23 04:59:00;5 minutes;At least 15 identical lights heading N/E on the same trajectory Clear sky, calm, looking northeast for meteors I noticed a formation in the the same line at about 30,000 feet. I watched for a minute then went inside to tell my girl friend to check them out. We watched about 8 more for another minute. They were about 1/4 mile apart traveling at the same speed a normal jetliner would be doing. No sound was heard like a normal jet at this altitude.;33.7492;-117.1128
