We look up and see 3 white lights moving in perfect unison with a blinking red light attached 100+ feet behind the last (Moving with the last light).   Only one sound was audible (as in only one engine/humming sound.)  Moving slowly and fairly low.   Could not have been a helicopter, was too large for any known heli.
