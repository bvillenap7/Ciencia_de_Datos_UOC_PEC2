I thought it was just a plane with bright lights, then i realized it was not moving.   i then began to watch to see if it may be a star or come up with an explanation. i ran to get my phone and record, which you barely see a dot of light.  i then ran to the restroom came back and couldnt see it.  NExt thing i know it moved diagonally upwards to the right. i had a tree top as a point of reference. all this happened in a about an hour.  i am not sure if starts move like this or maybe a satellite, but it is very bright flashing/blinking/moving lights. hard to explain.  i started watching this thing at 130 and it is still in the sky slowly ascending. it is now 230p;34.1269622641509;-117.653430188679
