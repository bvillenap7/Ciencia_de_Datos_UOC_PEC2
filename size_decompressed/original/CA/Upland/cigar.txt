It hovered completely motionless for 10-15 secon I was staying at my sisters apartment. We both had babies at that time, which is why I can recall the year so well. I had woken up with my son early to feed him. About 30 minutes later around 6-6:30 am I stepped out onto her balcony on the 2nd floor of her apartment. I was outside for roughly 5 minutes. The sky was well into getting light out, which is what caught my eye about what I saw. It had a bright, white glow to it. I saw it hovering  in the sky completely motionless for roughly 10-15 seconds. Then in a very fast speed,  it took off sideways and upwards out of site.;34.1269622641509;-117.653430188679

The craft was seen coming from upland towards Rancho Cucamonga at a very high rate of speed with no noise it was cigar shaped and metallic.  Way too fast for a normal fighter plane from close by Edwards Air force base.  It was flying at a relatively low level and was hard to follow on the street  in a vehicle.
