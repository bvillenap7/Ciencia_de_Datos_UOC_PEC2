Maybe what a satellite crossing the sky, would look like.;34.1269622641509;-117.653430188679
Unusual faint white circle moving faster than a jet traveling south to northeast over Upland CA at approximately 09:10 am.;2012-11-04 09:15:00;10 seconds;Unusual faint white circle moving faster than a jet traveling south to northeast over Upland CA at approximately 09:10 am. Was in the backyard taking photos of squirrels.   Looked up to the eastward sky as I followed the squirrel walk on the telephone line and saw a faint circle in the sky moving faster than a jet plane.   The object appeared to weave slightly and traveled from south to northeast and then disappeared into the blue sky.  The object was viewable for less than 10 seconds.   Personally have never seen an aircraft move at that high rate of speed.   I wonder if it may have been a satellite?   Usually the engines can be heard from normal airplane traffic.  There was no engine noise which could be heard from the object.   Because it flew too fast I was unable to snap a photo.;34.1269622641509;-117.653430188679
