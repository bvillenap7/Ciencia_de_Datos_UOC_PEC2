Triangle Shaped Craft over San Bernardino County;2011-06-02 20:00:00;15 seconds;Triangle Shaped Craft over San Bernardino County At approximately 7:30-8:00, I stepped outside on my friendâ€™s porch in Upland, CA, to smoke a cigarette. It was starting to get dark.  I like to look up at the aircrafts since there are two airports nearby.   While I was looking I saw a craft moving very rapidly from the south west to north east.  It was a triangle shape, with lights shining very brightly on all three points.  It was very large, much larger than the usual helicopters in the area, and took up more visual space than a plane.  It also was fairly high in altitude.  I only saw it for about twenty seconds, enough time to point out to a friend who confirmed the visual.   I lost track of it because of nearby trees.;34.1269622641509;-117.653430188679
Unidentified flying object was spotted in Upland California flashing red lights.;2014-07-06 00:00:00;10 minutes;Unidentified flying object was spotted in Upland California flashing red lights. Four red dots in the dark sky were spotted.  The dots were blinking in a circular formation.  These dots moved east then west again in the same city.  The brightness of these lights seemed to reveal a shiny aluminum metal color behind the light.   After 5 minutes of flashing in a circular format they changed into a cone format.   This has never happened in the area and it seems to be placed of the city's water tanks.;34.1269622641509;-117.653430188679
