Could not make out any particular shape other than it was bright, silvery and shimming. It ascended rapidly near the foothills mountains, Near and around Mt. Baldy, and Easterly. It maintained a height of about 4,000 ft. based on the scale of the mountains. From that point it continued going up pretty high. Lost sight after about 4 min. This was not a plane or a helicopter.;34.1269622641509;-117.653430188679
